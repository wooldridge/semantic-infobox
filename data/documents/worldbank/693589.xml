A. BACKGROUND&#13;
General&#13;
1.     Bosnia and ]Herzegovina (BH) has a total area of 51,500 km2. As a consequence of the Dayton&#13;
agreement the country is administratively divided into two parts: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina&#13;
(the Federation), which is mainly inhabited by the Muslim and Croat ethnic communities (approximately&#13;
26,500 kn2), and Republika Srpska (RS), with mainly Serb communities (approximately 25,000 ki2).&#13;
The population before the war was 4.4 million people. In 1996, it was estimated that over one million&#13;
people lived abroad and another 1.5 million were refugees within the boundaries of BH. Rural areas in&#13;
many parts of the country were totally abandoned by its former inhabitants.&#13;
2.     Before the war, forestry and wood based industries were an important part of the economy,&#13;
accounting for more than 10 percent of GSP1. Forestry alone accounted for about two percent of GSP,&#13;
with important and well managed forest resources. In 1990 the forest and the forest industry sector&#13;
employed 36,000 persons and accounted for an export value of US$250 million. The forest industries were&#13;
well developed and exported high quality products. Due to the war, the extraction of wood from the forests&#13;
and the production of the wood industry were much reduced. It is estimated that, for the period 1992-95,&#13;
the total utilization of installed capacity was only between 10 and 15 percent of pre-war levels.&#13;
Forest Resources and Management&#13;
3.     Forest Resources. The forest resources of Bosnia are amongst the highest in Europe, in terms of&#13;
extent and stock, when related to the size of the country. Forest land covers about 2.6 million ha, or about&#13;
50 percent of the total BH land area, of which about 2.1 million ha are actually covered with forests --&#13;
including 1.3 millon ha of high forests and 0.8 million ha of low forests -- the balance being composed of&#13;
bare lands2 . About 65 percent of the standing stock of Bosnian forests are broadleaves, mainly beech and&#13;
oak species, and 35 percent conifers, including fir, spruce, and pine species. About 45 percent of high&#13;
forests stands are mixed broadleaves and conifers while pure broadleaves and conifers represent 40 percent&#13;
and 15 percent of these stands respectively; low forests stands are composed of broadleaves only, either in&#13;
mixed stands (55%) or pure stands of beech or oak. The State owns 81 percent of forest land and private&#13;
holdings constitute 19 percent. The total growing stock on BH State land amounted to 359 million m3 (i.e.,&#13;
93% of the total) or 215 m3/ha of forested land in 1990. Corresponding figures for the private forests were&#13;
27 million rn3 (i.e., 7% of the total) and 62 ni3/ha respectively. The present distribution of forest resources,&#13;
in terms of areas and standing stock is about 55 percent for the Federation and 45 percent for RS.&#13;
Corresponding figures are shown in Table 1 below.&#13;
4.     Annual Yield, Allowable Cut and Removal. Actual removal of wood from Bosnian State forests&#13;
before the war, when compared with the Annual Allowable Cut (AAC) and estimated yield, indicates a&#13;
conservative harvesting policy. Between 1981 and 1990, the estimated annual current increment of the&#13;
standing stock of Bosnian State forests was 9.1 million rn3. During the same period, the AAC for these&#13;
forests -- which is the sum of the individual AACs adopted under the forest management plans (FMPs)&#13;
developed for each State Forest Enterprise (SFE) -- averaged about 6.8 million ni3. The recorded gross&#13;
I Within the former Yugoslavia, the measure of national income was Gross Social Product (GSP), a measure which excludes services,&#13;
eccept those involved in the transport and distribution of goods.&#13;
High forests are defined as forests originating from seeds, low forests are defined as forests originating from coppicing, bare lands&#13;
include 60% of productive bare lands, with productive potential, and 40% of unproductive bare lands which are unsuitable for forest&#13;
production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 2 of 27&#13;
harvesting in State forests for the same period averaged 6.2 million rn3 (including 3.7 million ni3 of logs) or&#13;
91 percent of AAC and 68 percent of the annual current increment. In addition, the annual current&#13;
increment estimated in 1990 for the subsequent 10-year period in BH State forests was projected at 10.4&#13;
million rn3. This suggests an increasing productivity compared with the previous 10-year period. Despite&#13;
this increase in productivity, the AAC for State forests over the same period, resulting from the AACs&#13;
adopted in current FMPs, is unchanged at 6.8 million rn3. Now that the country is partitioned into two&#13;
administrative entities, the total AAC in State forests is about 3.6 million rn3 for the Federation (of which&#13;
3.3 million rn3 in the high forests) and about 3.2 million m3 for RS (of which 2.9 million m3 in the high&#13;
forests). More detailed figures about estimated yield and AAC in the Federation and RS are shown in&#13;
Table 1 below.&#13;

The above table is based on data collected from different sources which are generally consistent However, some adjustnents had to be made in order&#13;
to make the data fully coherent&#13;
5.     During the war, the actual harvesting of wood was considerably reduced. After adjustment for&#13;
illegal cutting of logs and fuel wood (the latter mainly took place in low forests), the total harvesting in BH&#13;
is likely to have been about 2 million rn3 per year during the war or about 20 percent of the estimated&#13;
current increment of the standing stock and 30 percent of the AAC. In 1995, the recorded harvesting of&#13;
logs amounted to about 0.6 million m3 (0.2 million rn3 for the Federation and 0.4 million m3 for RS) or&#13;
about 15 percent of pre-war levels. Following the war, about 20 percent of the forest area has become&#13;
inaccessible because of minefields which makes it necessary to reduce the AAC accordingly -- e.g., the&#13;
AAC adjusted for mine areas in State high forests is an estimated 2.7 million m3 for the Federation and 2.3&#13;
million ni3 for RS.&#13;
6.     Since 1996, wood harvesting has resumed significantly in accessible areas; recorded figures for the&#13;
Federation and RS in 1996 are 1.0 million m3 and 0.9 million m3 respectively, in 1997 they are 1.6 million&#13;
mn3 and 1.3 million m3 respectively. The recorded 1997 level of wood harvesting is close to 60 percent of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 3 of 27&#13;
the AAC adjusted for mine areas. Since adequate control over harvesting has not yet been re-established,&#13;
there are increasing accounts of illegal harvesting and log smuggling. Since normal accessibility to forests&#13;
has not yet been restored, overharvesting is increasingly likely to take place in accessible areas.&#13;
7.     Forest Biodiversity. Bosnia's forests have a rich biological diversity, including an estimated 400&#13;
rare species of flora and over 200 rare species of fauna. The government organization for wildlife&#13;
protection3 is finishing the preparation of the list of flora species which are either threatened or&#13;
endangered; around 10 species are considered endangered so far. The government intends to start with the&#13;
preparation of a similar list for fauna species. The major threatened species are predatory birds (nine of&#13;
them are endangered) and aquatic birds (five are considered endangered). Besides the aforementioned nine&#13;
birds living in terrestrial ecosystems, there are 153 more singing birds and birds useful for forestry and&#13;
agriculture, as well as 66 aquatic birds. During the war, a large population of bears left the country for&#13;
forests in Slovenia and Croatia. Some are coming back, but the risk of crossing mined areas in high. All&#13;
the aforementioned birds and a large number of small mammals are going to be included in the fauna list.&#13;
8.     Currently there is no Environmental Law, but there are three major laws which contain&#13;
enviromnental provisions: (i) the Natural Heritage Law (issued in 1985, concerning the establishment and&#13;
management of protected areas); (ii) the Water Resources Law; and (iii) the Forest Law (issued in 1978,&#13;
which basically defines rules for production forestry but also includes aspects on forest protection). New&#13;
laws on land use, environmental protection and forest are currently being drafted. The new law on&#13;
environmental protection will draw together and strengthen the environmental provisions contained in the&#13;
existing sectoral laws. Under this new law, a series of regulations on water, air and natural resources&#13;
management will be promulgated, including emission and environmental quality standards for the control of&#13;
water and air pollution, and the establishment of the environmental inspection system. Based on the&#13;
experience in the other former Yugoslav republics, it is expected that environmental legislation will be&#13;
formulated to be in compliance with the European Union (EU) and agreed international conventions.&#13;
9.     In BH there are 31 protected areas,4 most of which are in RS, including the two national parks of&#13;
BH: the National Park of Sutjeska, with an area of 17,250 ha, including one of the last remnant of the&#13;
primary forest of Europe (the Perucica forest covering some 1,400 ha); and the National Park of Kozara,&#13;
with an area of 3,375 ha, which has been mainly established to protect historical heritage. The Federation&#13;
has only three small virgin/primary forests (total area of 375 ha) and three small reserves (420 ha). About&#13;
one percent of the territory of BH is protected which is lower than international norms. In 1980, it was&#13;
proposed that four percent of the territory of BH be set aside as protected areas. In the same year, an&#13;
environmental strategy was developed to increase this to 16 percent by the year 2000. Between 1980 and&#13;
the beginning of the war, a number of studies were carried out and some new areas were identified for&#13;
conservation action as areas of special value for their ecological diversity, sites that are environmentally&#13;
fragile, and places of scenic interest with ecotourism potential. Some of these areas have been studied as&#13;
potential new national parks, including the mountains of Treskavica and Igman Bjelasnica close to&#13;
Sarajevo, and the mountains of Preni, Cursnica and Cabulja located near the border of Bosnia with&#13;
Herzegovina. Due to the war and subsequent division of the Republic into two entities, the four percent&#13;
objective was not reached nor is it likely that the 16 percent strategy will be implemented by the year 2,000.&#13;

Two National Parks (20,625 ha); one Park of Nature (2,000 ha); four small virgin forest reserves (total area of 570 ha); one large virgin&#13;
forest reserve inside a National Park (1,434 ha); three small forest reserves (total area of 597 ha); fourteen very small special reserves (total&#13;
area of 269 ha) ; and six parks of forest (total area of 1,459 ha).&#13;

10.   Forest Management. There is a long tradition of sustainable management of forests in Bosnia --&#13;
originally based on principles introduced by the Austrians during the 1890s -- which is now regulated by&#13;
law. The overall Government policy is to: (i) improve the high forests, by increasing density and growing&#13;
stock and making a better utilization of site conditions; (ii) convert gradually coppice and shrub in low&#13;
forests into more productive forests where economically and environmentally acceptable; and (iii) convert&#13;
productive bare lands into forests.&#13;
11.   Forest management in Bosnia is mainly based on selective felling systems that aim to achieve a full&#13;
spectrum of ages in each forest stand. In such systems, harvesting takes place at regular intervals (about&#13;
every 10th year) so that the same amount, quality and species distribution will be available at the following&#13;
harvesting intervals. At present the following four systems guide the management of the forests: (i)&#13;
selective cutting, implying removal of damaged and dead trees and also oversized trees (more than 80 cm in&#13;
diameter); (ii) combined selective cutting and group selection cutting (clearfelling of small areas (0.3-0.5&#13;
ha) are also allowed); (iii) group selection cutting in pure stands of either broadleaves or conifers in&#13;
combination with clearfelling of areas up to 2.0 ha; and (iv) clearfelling of degraded high forests and&#13;
coppice forests for planting of areas up to 20 ha mainly with conifers.&#13;
12.   According to the Forest Law, forest regeneration (or "simple regeneration") is mandatory; for each&#13;
gross cubic meter felled, 14 rn2 of forests has to be regenerated. Under the above first three systems --&#13;
which are in force over about 95 percent of the area of State forests -- forest regeneration used to be&#13;
predominantly and successfully natural, which ensures ecosystems sustainability and biodiversity&#13;
conservation. Reforestation of degraded high forests and coppice, mainly with conifers, was also an&#13;
important element of forest management before the war. Afforestation of bare lands (also called "extended&#13;
regeneration"), however, was not achieved as planned, mainly because of lack of financing which was&#13;
supposed to come from the wood processing industries and local and central authorities. Between 1981-90,&#13;
an average of 13,400 ha per annum was planted for both reforestation and afforestation. Around 42&#13;
million seedlings were produced annually -- in 10 major nurseries covering a total area of about 300 ha --&#13;
from seeds of right provenances and proven good quality collected from trees and high quality seed stands&#13;
registered and tested from a genetic point of view.&#13;
13.   Forests in BH are managed according to FMPs developed for each SFE with a duration of 10-20&#13;
years. Before the war, FMPs were developed by specialized forest management planning units (see para.&#13;
17) located in Sarajevo and Banja Luka, usually over an 18-month period of combined field and desk work.&#13;
FMPs had to be approved first by the communes before final approval at the ministerial level. FMPs aim&#13;
for sustainable management and are based on the collection of detailed data on the status of the forests and&#13;
on modem forest management principles. The AAC set in these FMPs is lower than the potential&#13;
biological increment because of the above mentioned policy to increase the standing stock and the&#13;
increasing protective functions assigned to the forests. Based on the FMPs, SFEs prepare annual plans&#13;
which have to be approved at the ministerial level. The annual plans contain details of compartments to be&#13;
cut or otherwise treated, volumes to be removed (distributed on assortments), areas to be planted, roads to&#13;
be constructed and maintained, and budgets. Topographical maps in scales 1:10,000, 1:25,000 and&#13;
1:50,000, and forestry treatment maps are available for planning purposes.&#13;
14.   The war severely affected forest management, in varying ways. A significant amount of forests are&#13;
now inaccessible because of minefields -- from an estimated 15 percent - 20 percent of the total area in the&#13;
Federation to 20 percent - 25 percent in RS. The AAC will have to be reduced accordingly until these&#13;
mines are cleared. Based on the preliminary results from an ongoing assessment of Bosnian forest cover&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Techndcal Annex&#13;
Page 5 of 27&#13;
carried out with the assistance of the University of Alaska, about 80,000 ha - or about four percent of the&#13;
actual forest cover - were destroyed during the war. In most cases, destruction has affected numerous but&#13;
small areas of forests, either as a direct consequence of the war through artillery and grenades (both in the&#13;
form of destroyed trees and trees with shrapnel damage), or as an indirect consequence through&#13;
uncontrolled overexploitation of accessible forests for fuelwood.&#13;
15.   Another major consequence of the war on forests and forest management is an outbreak of insect&#13;
attacks mainly on coniferous forests. Populations of bark beetles -- mostly the bark borer (Ips&#13;
typographus) - have exploded because of two main reasons: first, direct war damage to spruce and fir&#13;
trees made them more susceptible to insect attacks; second, sanitary fellings -- and other management&#13;
practices that normally keep insect attacks under control - were discontmued during the war and have not&#13;
yet resumed. Controlling this outbreak is urgent because bark beetles, usually secondary pests (i.e.,&#13;
attacking trees already weakened by another pest or another cause), are becoming primary pests (i.e.,&#13;
attacking healthy trees). Controlling this outbreak also calls for methods other than usual management&#13;
practices, since the sources of infestation are concentrated in areas with poor accessibility because of mines&#13;
or an inadequate forest road network.&#13;
16.   During the war, all reforestation and afforestation efforts came to a halt. The production of&#13;
seedlings was discontinued, and the units for seed collection and processing in operation before the war&#13;
were destroyed. There is an urgent need to rehabilitate the nursery capacity, for the forestry reconstruction&#13;
program, and to make funding available for immediate reforestation needs in sensitive areas affected by&#13;
war damage, where adequate financing mechanisms for reforestation and afforestation are not yet in place.&#13;
In the Bosniac part of the Federation, these mechanisms do not exist; in the Herzegovinian part of the&#13;
Federation a tax of 0.07 percent on the profit from all commercial companies should be devoted to&#13;
afforestation purposes, but is not yet operational; in RS, similar mechanisms are in place and considered&#13;
operational.&#13;
17.   The development of FMPs has been discontinued since the beginning of the war and has not yet&#13;
resumed. The specialized forest management planning units in Sarajevo and Banja Luka are not able to&#13;
resume their activity since the former has been disbanded and the latter has lost all its equipment. As a&#13;
result, FMPs have now expired in about two third of the SFEs. In addition, a revision of some valid FMPs&#13;
is necessary due to the impact of the war in terms of changed boundaries of the SFEs close to the&#13;
confrontation line, and direct or indirect damage to the forests. The cumulative number of SFEs with&#13;
expired FMPs, FMPs to expire up to the end of 1998, and FMPs which need revision due to the war, may&#13;
amount to about 75 percent of the total. There is an urgent need to resume the preparation of FMPs. The&#13;
management planning units have to be operational again and exchange their information base, since the&#13;
area they used to cover is different from what they are covering now in the Federation and in RS.&#13;
18.   Harvesting Practices. Logging practices are fairly well developed in Bosnia. Chainsaws are used&#13;
for felling and bucking. Medium sized skidding tractors with articulated steering dominate off-road&#13;
transport, but farm tractors are also used when the terrain conditions permit. Horses are still used in both&#13;
the Federation and RS and also oxen in RS, especially for the sensitive operations such as the "one tree&#13;
selective cuttings". Surprisingly there seem to be very few cable logging systems in operation. The&#13;
authorities estimate that only five percent of the harvested volume is transported with some kind of cable&#13;
logging system. Average off-road transport distance is reported to be around 650 m going up to a&#13;
maximum of 2,000 m in areas with low road density. Chainsaws and tractors are most often owned by the&#13;
SFEs, but there is a tendency for private entrepreneurs and buyers of the wood to become increasingly&#13;
involved. The road transport operations are performed with trucks of varying type and standard. Trucks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 6 of 27&#13;
are commonly owned by local entrepreneurs, but the SFEs and sawmills are also engaged in this activity.&#13;
19.   Most of the wood harvesting and transport equipment was destroyed during the war. The share of&#13;
equipment destroyed is more significant in the Federation than in RS. Based on reports from the SFEs,&#13;
only the following share of pre-war equipment still remains (% in the Federation - % in RS): chainsaws&#13;
(10%-26%); skidders (17%/o-31%); andtrucks (280/o-50%). In addition, most ofthe equipment remaining in&#13;
SFEs is composed of old machinery and is performing poorly because of lack of maintenance during the&#13;
war. Since the end of the war, wood harvesting is recovering thanks to international assistance that has&#13;
provided SFEs with new harvesting equipment (i.e., chainsaws and skidders) and made credit schemes&#13;
available to emerging private entrepreneurs.&#13;
20.   Forest Roads. Although logging has been going on for over 100 years in BH, only since 1945&#13;
have trucks been used on forest roads. Earlier, special logging railways and cable systems were used for&#13;
log transport. About 2,000 km of such railways were in use at any one time. Both systems were gradually&#13;
abolished due to high costs, and the last railways ceased to operate in 1970. At present the total length of&#13;
forest roads is an estimated 11,000 km. The road density in high forests is about 10 m/ha, which is too low&#13;
for efficient management of the forests and results in high logging costs and environmental harm due to&#13;
long skidding distance. Once the existing forest roads network is rehabilitated, an increase in road density&#13;
would be desirable. Before the war, forest roads were well constructed according to a high standard and&#13;
seem to have been well maintained. Construction was undertaken either by the SFEs or by specialized&#13;
contractors. Road maintenance was carried out by the SFEs or contracted out for a period of 3-6 years,&#13;
depending on frequency of use.&#13;
21.   The conditions of forest roads deteriorated dramatically during the war; many roads and bridges&#13;
were damaged by heavy mi]iatary vehicles. Since the war, forest road rehabilitation has not resumed,&#13;
which has become a key bottleneck to resuming normal forest management. The standards to which the&#13;
forest roads are built demand that the roads must undergo regular maintenance to be usable for log&#13;
transport. Lack of maintenance since before the war has caused heavy damage to the road surface, ditches&#13;
and cross drainage, and to the bridges. About 3,400 km of forest roads in the Federation and 3,100 km in&#13;
RS need urgent maintenance and repair work. Unless forest roads are repaired and maintained to allow&#13;
access to other areas of forest, the areas which are now accessible will continue to be overexploited. In&#13;
order to cope with the road rehabilitation needs, SFEs urgently need to be provided with basic equipment&#13;
for road repair and maintenance.&#13;
Wood Industry&#13;
22.   BH has a long tradition in manufacturing mechanical wood products. The pre-war forest industry&#13;
was based on substantial (i.e., about 3.5 million ni3 a year) and suitable wood raw material, advanced&#13;
technology, high professional and labor skill, largely modem plant technology and a good market both&#13;
domestically and abroad. Before the war, the furniture industry was one of the most important sectors,&#13;
counting for more than 10 percent of the total industry production and generating a net export income of&#13;
US$ 200 million. Main export markets were the Balkans (25-30%) and other neighboring countries such&#13;
as Italy, France and Germany. The sector developed rapidly following World War II and in the mid 1980's&#13;
a total of nearly 180 wood processing factories, of which 60 percent were in the Federation and 40 percent&#13;
in RS, were operating for both primary (sawmilling) and secondary (furniture, joinery parquets, etc.)&#13;
production (see Table 2 below).&#13;

23.   After the war, about 80 percent of the wood processing capacity still remains intact. That means&#13;
that the primary and secondary wood processing capacity is grossly under-utilized; due to lack of available&#13;
wood raw material resulting from the unavailability of harvesting equipment. Some of the export market&#13;
for furniture has been taken over by other Central European countries and has become more competitive,&#13;
but there is no reason to believe that BH could not regain a significant share of this export market, given&#13;
the technological skill of its wood industry. Furthermore, the large need for building material, to&#13;
reconstruct the large number of houses destroyed during the war, means that there is a substantial domestic&#13;
market for wood based products such as window frames, doors, building materials and pre-fabricated&#13;
houses.&#13;
Institutional Framework&#13;
24.   Forestry Legislation. Before the war, the 1978 Forest Law - of which a brief account is given in&#13;
Appendix 7 (Attachment 1) -- was in force in Bosnia. That Law is still in force in the Federation, but is ill&#13;
adapted to the Federation's new organizational structure. A new Forest Law has been prepared for the&#13;
Federation, to provide an adequate legal framework for sustainable management of forest resources in the&#13;
new entity, but has not yet been approved. This is a major issue since essential legal provisions -- such as&#13;
the organization of Forest Inspection Services to enforce the law, and the organization of forest&#13;
management umts - are not in force. Approval of the draft new Forestry Law by the Government and&#13;
subsequent submission to the Parliament of the Federation will be a condition of effectiveness of the&#13;
project. As regards RS, a new Forest Law (02-764/94) has been in force since 1994 which provides an&#13;
adequate legal framework for forest management in that entity.&#13;
25.    Public Forestry Administration. The Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Forestry&#13;
(M4WF) and the MAinistry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Resources (MAFW) have overall&#13;
responsibility for forestry in the Federation and in RS respectively. The Forestry Department within these&#13;
Ministries is headed by a Vice-Minister who has a small technical staff including a Forest Inspection&#13;
Service (FIS). In the Federation, 10 Cantons have been set up for regional administration as part of the&#13;
Dayton Agreement. These Cantons have a similar administrative structure as the Federal administration,&#13;
including a Minister in charge of a Cantonal MAWF. The Cantons are not fully operational yet. The&#13;
Cantonal MAWFs are likely to have a small forestry department headed by a Vice-Minister, to handle&#13;
forestry matters in the Canton. The exact responsibilities of these departments and their relation with other&#13;
State entities in the forestry sector will be further clarified in the new Forest Law.&#13;
26.   Before the war, the Forest Inspection Service (FIS) used to monitor and inspect forestry related&#13;
activities regularly to ensure compliance with the Forest Law and relevant regulations. The FIS operated&#13;
under the overall control of a State Forest Inspector and had an organizational network which extended to&#13;
the Commune level; there were Commune Forest Inspectors (CFIs) in some 90 Communes. The CFIs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 8 of 27&#13;
supervised the activities of the forest and industrial enterprises in their areas. This system collapsed during&#13;
the war; it is being re-established progressively in the Federation and RS and is supposed to include one&#13;
general inspector at the central level and field inspectorates (10 in the Federation and 16 in RS). Field&#13;
inspectors in the Federation are likely to be established under the authority of the Cantonal administration.&#13;
For the time being, FISs lack the basic equipment and funding they need to operate.&#13;
27.   State Forest Enterprises. State owned forests were initially managed by socially owned State&#13;
forest enterprises called Sumsko Privredno Preduzece (gPP). The SPPs typically managed both the forest&#13;
industries and the surrounding forest areas which provided raw material to those industries. A reform&#13;
program for SPPs was underway before the war. In most cases the SPPs were divided into separate&#13;
industrial enterprises (sawmills, furniture, factories, etc.) and SFEs. In the case of the industrial&#13;
enterprises, a process of privatization was started by increasing financial autonomy and offering shares to&#13;
the workers. This process of privatization was interrupted by the war and there is still a majority share&#13;
ownership of the State; however, it is expected to resume as soon as conditions permit. In the case of the&#13;
SFEs, it was decided to keep them under State ownership, as is done in most forest rich countries.&#13;
28.   The SFEs (45 Sumarstvos in the Federation, and 43 gumsko Gazdinstvos in RS) are presently the&#13;
main unit managing State forests. They manage an average area of high forest of about 15,000 ha;&#13;
however, some SFEs have lost a large part of their area of control due to changes in bouandaries resulting&#13;
from the war and the Dayton agreement. SFEs used to operate as autonomous units, were largely financed&#13;
by their own revenues and, in the past, made substantial contributions to the national budget. In the&#13;
Bosniac part of the Federation the Sumarstvos are still fairly independent. They have to meet expenses&#13;
from their own revenues and maintain independent accounting systems. In the Herzegovinian part of the&#13;
Federation, the Sumarstvos are managed together as one entity. Incomes can be redistributed amongst the&#13;
Sumarstvos as necessary and the accounting system is centralized. The level of autonomy and financial&#13;
arrangements governing the gumarstvos has not yet been settled in anticipation of the new Forest Law. In&#13;
RS, Sumsko Gazdinstvos were independent during the war; they are now being progressively integrated in&#13;
Srpske Sume. In both the Federation and RS, SFEs have lost most of their operational capacity for&#13;
adequate surveillance and management of their forests with the destruction or loss of basic equipment (e.g.,&#13;
vehicles, telecommunication) and facilities (e.g., nurseries).&#13;
29.   Forest holding companies, called Bosanskoherzegovacke Sume (BH gume) in the Federation and&#13;
Srpske Sume in RS, have recently been formed to be responsible for all state owned forests within each&#13;
entity and to bring SFEs under more integrated management. BH Sume is not fully operational yet and its&#13;
final status and relation to local authorities (cantons) and to the Sumarstvos are to be defined in the new&#13;
Forest Law currently being drafted. Srpske Sume has a more advanced organization and is progressively&#13;
becoming operational.&#13;
30.    Staffing. The overall number of staff working in forest management is about half of what it was&#13;
before the war. The situation is particularly bad in areas where most of the population has been displaced&#13;
due to the war. Although there was significant overstaffing before the war, the present management&#13;
capacity is only sufficient to resume part of the pre-war operational level. Adequate staffing levels are&#13;
critical, particularly in positions dealing with management and control, in both SFEs and the Forest&#13;
Inspection Services. The general situation is changing daily with the return of de-mobilized soldiers and&#13;
refugees.&#13;
31.   Forestry Research and Training. The Forestry Research Institute in Sarajevo was totally&#13;
demolished during the war and its reconstruction will be costly and time consuming. SIPAD (a holding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 9 of 27&#13;
company for forest industries) had a Planning and Research Department consisting of 2 units, one in&#13;
Sarajevo and one in Banija Luka, whose main activity was to prepare forest management plans for the SFEs&#13;
and for private forest owners on contract. These units became independent from §IPAD in 1990 and&#13;
stopped functioning dunng the war; the facilities in Sarajevo were largely destroyed. The remains of these&#13;
units and its present small staff have been reabsorbed into BH Sume and Srpske Sume. The unit in the&#13;
latter is supposed to develop research activities in addition to FMPs. Forestry training was also totally&#13;
disrupted during the war. Forestry curricula are being re-established in the faculties of forestry in the&#13;
Universities of Sarajevo and Banja Luka.&#13;
32.    The Private Sector. The private secjor plays a modest role in forest management, since private&#13;
ownership is limited to about 19 percent of the forest area. Production and self consumption of firewood&#13;
are the main objectives of the forestry activities carred out by private owners. The large number of private&#13;
small landowners and the degraded structure of many private forests reduce the private sector's political&#13;
importance. The involvement of private enterprises in felling, harvesting and transport of logs is still&#13;
modest but has significantly increased since the end of the war.&#13;
33.   Fiscal and Marketing Policies. Under the fiscal system in the pre-war period, the forestry sector&#13;
was expected to generate sufficient revenues to replant and maintain the forest, provide improved facilities&#13;
to workers and staff, and make a significant contribution to the national budget. Often SFEs were also&#13;
expected to play a social function and employ more staff than was required. Under the Forestry Law, a&#13;
local tax of 10 percent of sales revenue was levied on all SFEs. Revenues from this tax were administered&#13;
by the communes and supposed to be used for replanting. SFEs typically also set aside another 10 percent&#13;
of sales revenue to purchase new equipment as required; pay for preparation of forest management plans&#13;
and various studies; and construct new houses and facilities for their workers. Most SFEs had substantial&#13;
funds remaining even after making the above provisions. In some cases these net surpluses exceeded 20&#13;
percent of revenues. These funds were passed back to the State through a profit tax of 35 percent and as&#13;
direct transfer.&#13;
34.   During the war the forest industry collapsed and ceased to make any significant contribution to the&#13;
national fiscal system. Most SFEs were unable to operate normally and took to selling standing trees to&#13;
private contractors. Revenues generated from the sale of trees was used to pay workers and essential&#13;
operating expenses. In some cases the SFEs could not even generate these funds and workers were not paid&#13;
for many months. Their obligation under the Forest Law to set aside a share of sales revenue continues.&#13;
The extent to which SFEs have managed to set aside these funds is unclear as many do not pay these taxes&#13;
but claim to have replanted the forests themselves. However, given the limited sale of wood and&#13;
consequent difficulties even with paying salaries, it is doubtful if they have been able to set aside the&#13;
amounts required for replanting.&#13;
35,    The pre-war fiscal system which relied on taxes and transfer of profit was appropriate for a&#13;
situation where most harvesting was done by the SFEs. It is not suitable for a system where harvesting is&#13;
increasingly being done by small private contractors. Over the long run it would be necessary to move to a&#13;
system where the stumpage charge on standing trees is the main method of extracting rent from the forestry&#13;
sector. The selling of standing trees, which is emerging gradually, is in principle the correct one, although&#13;
the price paid may not be appropriate due to the depressed economic conditions and difficulties faced by the&#13;
industry. A review of the fiscal and wood pricing systems is needed to assess how best the forestry sector&#13;
could contribute to social development and tax collection. The project would fund such a review.&#13;

B. BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
36. On April 1, 1996, BH fulfilled the conditions of succession to the former Socialist Federal&#13;
Republic of Yugoslavia's membership in the Bank, IDA and IFC. Membership is retroactive to February&#13;
25, 1993. The resolution of BH's arrears with the World Bank, through consolidation of its IBRD debt,&#13;
allowed regular Bank lending to begin in June 1996. With a war-devastated economy, low post-war per&#13;
capita GDP and lack of creditworthiness, BH was declared IDA eligible.5&#13;
37.    Since early 1995, the Bank Group has been deeply involved in developing, with the BH authorities,&#13;
a blueprint for reconstruction of the country's economy. A three- to four-year Priority Reconstruction&#13;
Program totaling some $5.1 billion was endorsed by donors following signing of the Dayton-Paris Peace&#13;
Accords in December 1995. Since then, three donors' conferences co-sponsored by the World Bank and&#13;
the EU have mobilized pledges of some $3.1 billion from sixty bilateral and multilateral donors for&#13;
reconstruction and economic recovery in both the Federation and Republika Srpska.&#13;
38.    In the immediate post-war period, the Bank's assistance strategy aimed at jump-starting economic&#13;
activity through emergency projects in a broad range of areas, including rebuilding of government&#13;
institutions and funding of a line of credit to small business, rehabilitating agriculture, water and sanitation,&#13;
transport, health, education, energy, and housing, clearing landmines, establishing a guarantee facility for&#13;
industry, and generating employment through public works, re-training and loans to microbusinesses. The&#13;
Bank's assistance program also supported the initial phase of the government's macroeconomic and&#13;
institutional reforms. Leveraging Bank resources with funding from donors has been an important element&#13;
of this strategy.&#13;
39.    The Bank's first formal Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (FY98-99) was endorsed by the Board&#13;
of Executive Directors in August 1997, and emphaizes sustainability and ensuring the medium- to long-&#13;
term viability of policies and investments.6 While donor resources will be needed for the next several years,&#13;
BH must increasingly become more self-reliant in preparation for the time when these inflows are no longer&#13;
available. This will mean viable government institutions, sustainable government budgets, improved cost-&#13;
recovery policies and mechanisms and structural reforms that stimulate private investment.  Three&#13;
overarching objectives form the basis of this strategy: (i) further development of the basic institutional&#13;
infrastructure for economic management, including public finance; (ii) transition to a market economy&#13;
through deepening of major structural reforms in banking and private sector development; and (iii)&#13;
increasing the financial sustainability of physical reconstruction programs and projects.&#13;
40.    Policy-enhancing adjustment operations are envisaged to support institution-building at the State&#13;
and Entity level, as well as key reforms in the areas of public finance, banking, privatization, including a&#13;
planned Public Finance Structural Adjustment Credit and an Enterprise and Bank Privatization Adjustment&#13;
Credit. The Bank will also continue to support reconstruction in selected sectors, including infrastructure&#13;
and the social sectors. Limited IDA resources will continue to make partnerships with other donors&#13;
essential. Mobilizing co-funding for future operations, and coordinating strategies -- e.g., eventual exit&#13;
from those sectors where other donors are more fully engaged or have greater comparative advantage --&#13;
will be important elements of this partnership.&#13;

41.   The proposed Forestry Project would form an important element of the current strategy aimed at&#13;
moving from reconstrction to sustainable growth. Indeed, the project would support policy reforms in the&#13;
forestry sector, institutional strengthening in forest conservation and management, and sustainable&#13;
management of forest resources to secure both sustained provision of environmental benefits and sustained&#13;
supply of raw material to the wood industry. In that respect, the project is an essential complement to the&#13;
IFC agency line project that supports the development of modem and efficient wood processing in Bosnia.&#13;
C. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Project Objective and Rationale&#13;
42.   The objective of the project is to resume sustainable management and protection of Bosnian forest&#13;
resources, in order to: (i) ensure the sustainablility of the rapid recovery of the wood harvesting and wood&#13;
processing sectors; and (ii) control the potential environmental impact of this recovery.&#13;
43.   The project has high priority in the Government's reconstruction program, because of the economic&#13;
and environmental importance of the forestry sector in the country. The forestry sector is subject to&#13;
growing demand to provide raw material for the reconstruction of war damaged buildings, from local&#13;
sources rather than imports, and for the production of wood products with high potential for exports. In&#13;
order to cope with that demand, the Government aims at securing sustained supply of high quality raw&#13;
material, while safeguarding the environmental functions of Bosnian forests. The rationale for emergency&#13;
donor assistance to implement the project include the urgent need to:&#13;
(a) resume sustainable management of forest resources.  Project assistance would halt resource&#13;
degradation in accessible areas where wood harvesting is concentrated now, and make it possible to&#13;
take the necessary mimediate measures to address direct and indirect consequences of the war to&#13;
the forests;&#13;
(b) secure environmental functions of forests. Project assistance would help resume multi-purpose&#13;
management of forests, improve forest health, and develop conservation of forest biodiversity; and&#13;
(c) provide employment to demobilized soldiers in rural areas. Project assistance would help revive&#13;
local economy in areas which depend almost entirely on forest based activities.&#13;
44.   The project would be consistent with the World Bank Forest Policy since it would help: (i) re-&#13;
establish the pre-war institutional framework of the forestry sector which was able to ensure sustainable&#13;
conservation and use of existing forests; (ii) resume environmentally sound management of forests with&#13;
communal participation; and (iii) restore and expand the pre-war system of protected areas for biodiversity&#13;
conservation.&#13;
Design Considerations&#13;
45.   The project was initially designed and prepared in 1996 as emergency assistance to the Bosnian&#13;
forestry sector. The project aimed mainly at jump-starting the wood harvesting capacity of SFEs, which&#13;
had been almost completely destroyed during the war, to supply wood industries (largely intact despite the&#13;
war) in order to meet an urgent demand for reconstruction material. The project was also designed to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 12 of 27&#13;
provide initial support to resuming sustainable management of Bosnian forests, which had been disrupted&#13;
during the war.&#13;
46.   Due to the delay in project approval, it has been necessary to adjust project design in view of the&#13;
recent developments in the forestry sector over the past 2 years. Since 1996, harvesting has resumed quite&#13;
substantially thanks, inter alia, to international financial assistance through credit schemes and grants.&#13;
However, forest management planning and enforcement of forest legislation has not resumed; forest health&#13;
is deteriorating with growing threat of insect attacks; the capacity of SFEs to control wood harvesting and&#13;
to resume sustainable management of forest resources has not improved; and the accessibility to forests has&#13;
worsened, since little action has been taken to rehabilitate forest roads damaged during the war. The real&#13;
need now is urgent support for rehabilitation of forest protection and management, to ensure that forest&#13;
resources are sustainably utilized.&#13;
47.   To address these changing needs in the forestry sector, the Government and the Bank agreed to&#13;
revise project design in March 1998. The project would remain essentially a reconstruction operation; it&#13;
would however focus on resuming sustainable management of forests and would no longer finance&#13;
harvesting equipment. Funds which initially were available for such equipment have been re-allocated to&#13;
support sustainable forest management operations, including an expanded forest management planning&#13;
program, immediate action to protect forests from insect attacks, protected areas development,&#13;
rehabilitation of nurseries, and maintenance and repair of war damaged forest roads. Another project&#13;
design consideration is to support the SFEs according to a strict selection procedure which was agreed&#13;
upon during project preparation.&#13;
Detailed Features&#13;
48.   The project would have the following four components, to be implemented during a two-year&#13;
period: "Support to Forest Management;" "Protection and Rehabilitation of Forests;" "Rehabilitation of&#13;
SFEs Operational Capacity;" and "Project Management and Monitoring."&#13;
Support to Forest Management&#13;
49.   Support to Policy Changes. The project would support two studies on: (i) the institutional&#13;
aspects; and (ii) the fiscal and marketing aspects of the forestry sector in the Federation and in RS. These&#13;
studies would aim at providing the MAWF and the MAFW with operational guidance to develop the policy&#13;
changes -- regarding the institutional setting for forestry and wood marketing, trading and pricing -- that&#13;
are necessary to adapt the forestry sector to the ongoing transition of Bosnma into a market economy. These&#13;
studies would be carried out according to the following timetable: tenns of reference would be ready and&#13;
approved by the MAWF, the MAFW, IDA and the EU by December 31, 1998; the draft report, for&#13;
MAWF, MAFW, IDA and EU review, would be ready by September 30, 1999; and the final report would&#13;
be ready by December 31, 1999.&#13;
50.   Forest Management Planning. The project would support the preparation of FMPs over about&#13;
600,000 ha in 24 SFEs (about 320,000 ha in some 13 gumarstvos in the Federation, and about 280,000 ha&#13;
in some 11 Sumsko Gazdinstvos in RS) during the two-year project implementation period. Indeed, about&#13;
two thirds of the FMPs in both the Federation and RS have expired, and the remainder will expire in the&#13;
next five years. In addition, the war has changed the boundaries and the forest conditions in some&#13;
management units, and these changes need to be incorporated into new FMPs. Priority for new FMPs&#13;
would be given to those SFEs with expired FMPs, which have large forest areas and high degree of war&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

damage. Details on the present forest management planning system and the project proposal are available&#13;
in Appendix 7.&#13;
51.    The project would fund the re-establishment of a forest inventory and management planning unit in&#13;
BH Sume in Sarajevo for the Federation, and strengthen the forest research and management unit in Srpske&#13;
Sume in Banja Luka for RS. Provisions would include: (i) equipment, which would be the same for each&#13;
of these two units (field forestry inventory equipment; five 4WD vehicles for field inventory teams and one&#13;
4WD vehicle placed centrally for supervision and control of field activities; equipment for processing field&#13;
data such as computers and printers; a Geographical Information System including hardware and software;&#13;
and equipment for printing and copying maps); (ii) technical assistance and training, including international&#13;
expertise in forest management planning, national environmental expertise, national assistance for data&#13;
processing, training of SFE staff and entrepreneurs in improved sustainable harvesting methods, and&#13;
overseas study tours for BH gume and Srpske Sume staff to look at other management planning systems;&#13;
(iii) funding for specific FMP studies (e.g., study of the evolution of the forest cover in recent years based&#13;
on aerial photography and satellite remote sensing; sociological surveys); and (iv) recurrent costs&#13;
associated with field data collection. The project would also support continued development in the&#13;
exchange of information on forest management between the two forest inventory and management planning&#13;
units.&#13;
52.    Support to the FIS. The project would fund the re-establishment of the FISs in the Federation&#13;
and in RS in order to resume and secure adequate enforcement of forestry legislation by the MAWF and the&#13;
MAFW respectively. Each FIS comprises one General Inspectorate at the ministerial level and field&#13;
inspectors (10 in the Federation and 12 in RS). During the negotiations of the IDA financing, assurance&#13;
was given by both the Federation and RS that the assignment of field forest inspectors would be completed&#13;
by August 31, 1998. The project would fund vehicles (12 4WD vehicles for the Federation and 13 for RS),&#13;
field and office equipment including computers, national technical assistance, and recurrent costs&#13;
associated with field work of the inspectors. The project would also fund a training program in order to&#13;
ensure that new staff are properly prepared for their tasks, and to provide in-service training for existing&#13;
staff. The FISs and proposed support are described in detail in Appendix 6.&#13;
Protection and Rehabilitation of Forests&#13;
53.   Protection of Forests from Insect Attacks. The project would support a comprehensive program&#13;
to control insect attacks on Bosnian forests, mostly bark beetles that affect coniferous stands. The program&#13;
would be based on a medium-term strategy, which is being developed with the assistance of the EU, that&#13;
combines standard forest management practices (e.g., sanitary felling, debarking and swift removal of&#13;
attacked trees) with measures to control insect populations at the main sources of infestation. The project&#13;
would provide direct funding to these measures, based on biological insect control methods, by establishing&#13;
a network of pheromone traps over 150,000 ha of infested coniferous stands that serve as a potential source&#13;
of further infestation of about 350,000 ha of forests. Pheromones are species-specific substances produced&#13;
by female insects to attract males. The project would fund the traps (either manufactured traps or the&#13;
establishment of trap-trees), the artificial production of pheromones, and forest works to establish the&#13;
network.&#13;
54.   Reforestation of Damaged Forests. The project would provide funds for the reforestation of&#13;
about 500 ha in areas heavily damaged during the war. Project support would be limited to the Federation&#13;
only, since funding for such activities in RS is available from other sources. The precise scope and&#13;
location of project supported reforestation would be decided after completion of the ongoing assessment of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 14 of 27&#13;
the Bosnian forest cover (see para. 14). Project support would include reforestation of land clearfelled for&#13;
fuelwood during the war in the vicinity of major population centers, and reforestation of environmentally&#13;
fragile areas destroyed during the war.&#13;
55.    Protected Areas Development.  The project would support the re-establishment of normal&#13;
surveillance and protection of the National Park of Sutjeska in RS, which is the only existing protected area&#13;
in Bosnia with significant biodiversity. The project would also support the development of new protected&#13;
areas in the Federation including: (i) the creation of the Igman Bjelasnica National Park; and (ii) ecological&#13;
surveys in six biologically sensitive areas. These areas are among those identified since 1980 as potential&#13;
targets for conservation action (see para. 9) and they are located in 10 of the Sumarstvos eligible for&#13;
project support. The results from the surveys would be used to propose protection measures, including the&#13;
creation of new protected areas, and would be incorporated in the FMPs in the corresponding Sumarstvos.&#13;
56.   In the National Park of Sutjeska, the project would fund two 4WD vehicles, radio communication&#13;
equipment, reconstruction of 3 guard posts, technical assistance to develop a new management plan, and&#13;
study tours for Park staff to look at other National Parks abroad. In the Federation, the project would&#13;
fund: (i) the feasibility study for the creation of the Igman Bjelasnica National Park; and (ii) field and&#13;
office equipment, one 4WD vehicle, training, and local and international technical assistance for the&#13;
development of the ecological surveys, which is the responsibility of the IPCHNH (see para. 7). Project&#13;
support to these ecological surveys is described in detail in Appendix 6.&#13;
Rehabilitation of SFEs Operational Capacity&#13;
57.    This component would restore the operational capacity of selected SFEs in both the Federation and&#13;
RS. The project would help restore pre-war accessibility to the forests and provide SFEs and their staff&#13;
with the equipment necessary to resume normal surveillance and protection of forests, carry out forest&#13;
regeneration and other silvicultural works, and organize and control sustainable forest harvesting. The&#13;
project would fund: (i) equipment to repair and maintain existing forest roads damaged during the war; and&#13;
(ii) other forestry equipment to resume normal operation of SFEs. The types of equipment included under&#13;
this component (see summary technical specifications in Appendix 4) were used extensively before the war.&#13;
Management capability for such equipment as well as skilled laborers are available. The equipment could&#13;
therefore be in full operation shortly after delivery.&#13;
58.    Fifty one SFEs would be eligible for project support -- including 30 Sumarstvos7 in the Federation&#13;
and 21 gumsko Gazdinstvos in RS -- of which the list is given in Appendix 5, together with the types and&#13;
amount of the equipment for which they would be eligible. These SFEs have been selected mainly on the&#13;
basis of the potential of their forest resources and their proximity to an operating wood processing facility.&#13;
These SFEs manage 95 percent and 50 percent of the high forests in the Federation and RS, respectively.&#13;
59.    Forest Road Repair and Maintenance Equipment. The project would provide equipment to&#13;
cope with urgent needs for repairing and maintaining forest roads damaged either directly by war activities&#13;
or indirectly because of lack of maintenance during the war. Project support would make it possible to&#13;
repair and maintain 4,000 km of forest roads (about 2,500 km in the Federation and 1,500 km in RS) over&#13;
10 years. The equipment provided is such that it would not be suitable for construction of new roads.&#13;
The geographical distribution of the 30 eligible Sumarstvos is the following: 15 are in the Bosniac Cantons (i.e. Cantons 1, 3, 4, 5, and&#13;
9); 6 are in Croatian Cantons (i.e. Canton 10, which is the only one with sufficient forest resources); and 9 are in mixed Bosniac and&#13;
Croatian Cantons (i.e. Cantons 6 and 7).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 15 of 27&#13;
60.    The project would fund: (i) 20 wheel loaders/excavators (15/Fed. and 5/RS); (ii) 15 graders&#13;
(I0/Fed. and 5/RS); and (iii) 25 tractors with tipper trailer (15/Fed. and 1O/RS). The proposed number of&#13;
units would be sufficient to perform the most urgent repairs of road sections in the selected SFEs and thus&#13;
resume operations in accordance with FMPs. The proposed mix of equipment would make it possible to&#13;
adapt the method of road repair to region and damage. The loaders/excavators -- wheel-based tractors with&#13;
a front-end loader and an excavator attachment in the rear -- would be utilized for rebuilding part of the&#13;
road washed away because of damaged drainage systems, repairing destroyed drain pipes and culverts and&#13;
repairing bridges. The graders would be used to cut the shoulders and side drains of the road to rebuild the&#13;
body of the road with the extracted material. They would also be used to grade the surface of damaged&#13;
roads and carry out normal maintenance work. The tractors and trailers with hydraulic tipping facilities&#13;
would facilitate the movement of material without dumping excavated material, which causes&#13;
environmental damage. These tractors would also be used to fill potholes in the road and to transport new&#13;
surface material to the road.&#13;
61.    Other Forestry Equipment. The project would also help the eligible SFEs resume normal&#13;
management and surveillance of their forests by providing basic equipment. The project would fund the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a) Vehicles including (i) 50 minibuses of 9 seats to transport personnel (30/Fed. and 20/RS); (ii) 50&#13;
field 4WD cars (30/Fed. and 20/RS) for management and supervising staff of the SFEs; and (iii)&#13;
300 mopeds (180/Fed. and 120/RS) to improve the efficiency of forest guards in the SFEs. Buses&#13;
to transport workers from their houses to the working places in the forests are now urgently needed&#13;
to restart forestry activities. However, the number and size of the buses financed by the project&#13;
would be smaller than before the war, since the workforce remaining in the SFEs will concentrate&#13;
progressively on silvicultural operations while the harvesting and log transport activities would be&#13;
privatized. Field 4WD cars and mopeds would make it possible to resume forest surveillance and,&#13;
for forest guards in particular, to protect forests and perform legal duties, including controlling&#13;
forest products, their storage and transportation, and report noticed irregularities, which have&#13;
increased in the present post-war situation;&#13;
(b) Wood Transport Equipment including 12 trucks, for the Federation only, with cranes specialized&#13;
for log loading -- at road side in the forest -- and transport. These trucks are essential for SFEs&#13;
managing forests with high levels of insect attacks, in order to ease swift extraction of logs from&#13;
sanitary felling in infested areas;&#13;
(c) Nursery Equipment including 10 multiple purpose tractors (5/Fed. and 5/RS) and 12 sets of&#13;
nursery equipment (7/Fed. and 5/RS) (for substrate preparation, seedling watering, and soil&#13;
preparation). Indeed, as a consequence of the war, most of the nurseries have interrupted their&#13;
activities. With the proposed equipment, the project would help revive the most needed nurseries in&#13;
order to make it possible to resume the reforestation programs which, as complements to natural&#13;
regeneration after harvesting, are mandated by law;&#13;
(d) Telecommunication Equipment including one modem radio-communication  system (i.e. 10&#13;
handheld units, 1 to 3 vehicle units, 1 central unit, and 1 repetitor) for each of the selected SFEs.&#13;
This equipment would make it possible to ensure efficient communication between offices and field&#13;
staff of the SFEs and to control illegal activities.&#13;
&#13;

62.   SFE Eligibility and Equipment Allocation Criteria. The proposed selection of the 50 SFEs&#13;
eligible for project support, and the proposed allocation of project funded equipment, was based on criteria&#13;
agreed upon with both the MAWF in the Federation and the MAFW in RS, and on a survey of all&#13;
Sumarstvos and Sumsko Gazdinstvos conducted respectively by BH Sume and Srpske Sume. The survey&#13;
was based on a questionnaire which made it possible, for each SFE, to assemble updated information on&#13;
forest resources, AAC, past and present harvesting levels, staffing, and the remaining equipment after war&#13;
destruction. The survey also made it possible to know from SFE managers: (i) what forest road repair and&#13;
maintenance equipment and wood transport equipment they requested, under the agreed supply and credit&#13;
arrangements proposed by the project (see para. 80); and (ii) their needs for other forestry equipment.&#13;
63.   An over-riding condition for project support to an SFE is the availability of an established, valid&#13;
and ecologically sound FMP. If the FMP has expired, an approved annual plan should be made available&#13;
before implementation of project activities in the SFE8  The allowable cut under the annual plan should&#13;
not be higher than the AAC under the expired FMP. Actual development, under provisions acceptable to&#13;
the World Bank, and approval at the ministerial level, of the annual plans for 1998 -- for the SFEs for&#13;
which the forest management plan has expired without being renewed -- would be a condition of&#13;
effectiveness of the project. Furthermore no area within a Sumarstvo, which is under consideration for&#13;
protection purposes in the Federation, should be subject to logging until the management plan of this area&#13;
has been established and agreed upon.&#13;
64.   Within the above considerations, the selection of SFEs eligible for project support was based on&#13;
the following criteria: (i) an AAC in high forests, after adjustment for mined forest areas, of at least 20,000&#13;
in3; (ii) availability of a wood processing unit within 80 km with sufficient capacity to process the available&#13;
AAC from the SFE; and (iii) the degree of war damage to the equipment of the SFE. The project will not&#13;
support any SFE with a director or manager who has a criminal record or who has been indicted for any&#13;
felony.&#13;
65.   The proposed allocation of equipment to the SFEs eligible for project support would be based on&#13;
the following rules: (i) equipment for road repair and maintenance would be allocated according to the&#13;
importance of forest roads to be repaired in each SFE; (ii) each SFE would be provided with at least one&#13;
field 4WD car and one minibus; additional cars and minibuses, as well as mopeds, could be allocated&#13;
according to the area of high forest managed by the SFE; and (iii) provision of equipment would not exceed&#13;
the levels requested by the SFEs managers. The proposed allocation of equipment to the SFEs has also&#13;
been adjusted to ensure that the general employment situation is adequately and equitably addressed by the&#13;
project.&#13;
Project Management and Monitoring&#13;
66.   Project management and monitoring would be the responsibility of: (i) the Project Implementation&#13;
Unit (PIU) established under the MAWF to implement internationally funded projects in the Federation;&#13;
and (ii) the new PIU recently established under the authority of the MAFW to implement the project in RS.&#13;
The PIUs would coordinate project implementation and implement procurement, disbursement, auditing,&#13;
and reporting procedures required under the project, according to the respective rules of the project&#13;
financiers. These PIUs would be provided with incremental staff (with expertise in forestry, procurement,&#13;
and accounting), vehicles and office equipment. The project would also fund the equipment, international&#13;
and local expertise, and particular studies necessary for the project Monitoring and Evaluation system,&#13;
8 The Forest Law explicitly provides for the extension of expired FMPs on an annual basis. These extension plans are based on the same&#13;
level of sustainable AAC as the expired plans.&#13;

68.    Project Financing. The State of Bosnia and Herzegovina would be the Recipient of the funds to&#13;
be provided by various donors. Of the total project cost, the Bank would finance US$7 million equivalent&#13;
with a Credit from the Interim Trust Fund (ITF) administered by IDA. Based on principles agreed upon&#13;
during the negotiations of the project, IDA would fund priority cost items for which cost recovery&#13;
mechanisms would be secured (i.e., supply and credit arrangements, see para. 80). The EU is committed to&#13;
provide an ECU8 million grant, equivalent to US$8.7 million. The financing of the remaining US$4.5&#13;
million (or 22% of total project costs) is being confinned from other donors. Italy has earmarked a DM4&#13;
million grant, equivalent to US$2.1 million, to cofinance the project; Norway has indicated interest in&#13;
complementing the financing of the project. Project financing is presented in Table 4.&#13;

Environmental Impact&#13;
69.    The project was given the Environmental Category "B" status, which requires remedial measures&#13;
for possible environmental impacts. The Environmental Assessment (EA) of the project, presented in&#13;
Appendix 6, was carried out in 1996, when the project was initially designed as an emergency operation&#13;
(see para. 45). The EA report made an assessment of environmental conditions, laws and institutions;&#13;
identified the envirommental impacts likely to result from the resumption of harvesting and the rehabilitation&#13;
of forest roads; and proposed a mitigation plan together with a project environmental monitoring plan. The&#13;
potential negative environmental impacts identified by the EA were: (i) possible unsustainable wood&#13;
harvesting; (ii) loss of biodiversity; (iii) loss of critical habitat; and (iv) increased soil erosion and&#13;
degradation of water quality. These impacts would result mostly from harvesting activities. Road&#13;
rehabilitation would have only limited impact, since project activities would consist of small-scale&#13;
operations confined to rehabilitation of existing roads, and would not require any mitigation measures.&#13;
70.    Since project preparation in 1996, wood harvesting has resumed significantly in Bosnia.&#13;
Enforcement of sustainable forest management and protection are now the growing emergency needs.&#13;
Consequently, the project has been restructured to focus on strengthening forest protection and&#13;
management, and no longer supports harvesting. Despite these changes, the EA continues to remain valid.&#13;
Its concerns and measures, which concentrate primarily on mitigating the potential negative impacts of&#13;
harvesting, are equally important as guidelines for addressing sustainable forest management concerns and&#13;
are, therefore, fully integrated into the project's design and activities.&#13;
71.    The project's Environmental Category rating was recently reviewed, to take into account these&#13;
changes in the project design, and it was agreed that the project will retain its category "B" classification,&#13;
which was originally assigned taking into consideration the emergency nature of the project. Since the&#13;
revised project (i) does not support harvesting activity; and (ii) fully incorporates the mitigation measures&#13;
proposed in the EA, the criteria under which the project received its category "B" rating have not changed,&#13;
and consequently there is no justification for changing the rating.&#13;
72.    During preparation in 1996, due to logistical reasons, the EA was carried out at the level of the&#13;
Federation of BH only. Carrying out a subsequent and specific EA for RS was not considered necessary&#13;
since (i) project activities in RS are of the same nature as in the Federation, but more modest in scope; (ii)&#13;
environmental conditions and policies in the Federation and in RS are similar; and (iii) the EA is mostly&#13;
based on pre-war and Bosnia-wide information which apply to both the Federation and RS, which is still&#13;
the only information available.&#13;
73.    Sustainable Harvesting Level. The accelerated forest management planning covered by the&#13;
project will ensure that the forests are managed according to their current conditions, and cope with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 19 of 27&#13;
expiration of many of the FMPs during the war. In addition, project support to make the system of Forest&#13;
Inspectors operational again will ensure that ecologically sound forest management is properly controlled.&#13;
74.    Biodiversity Conservation. The selective felling management system, traditionally practiced in&#13;
BH, warrants satisfactory conservation of the present level of forest biodiversity under the project. This&#13;
system aims at keeping all age classes in forest stands. In such a system harvesting takes place at regular&#13;
intervals (about every 10th year), and includes the felling of mature trees and a cross section in all age&#13;
classes at a level which ensures that the same amount, quality and species distribution would be available&#13;
at the following harvesting interval in perpetuity. Only limited clearfelling is allowed, mainly to improve&#13;
degraded forest. As a result of this system, most of the forests in BH are naturally regenerated. This&#13;
system is conducive to conservation of biodiversity, since the diversity of natural stands is maintained to&#13;
the maximum extent possible during the whole production cycle.&#13;
75.    Critical Habitat Preservation. In order to prevent risks of reducing critical habitat within&#13;
biologically rich forest areas which should be preserved, the following measures are included in the project:&#13;
(i) immediate project support would be limited to SFEs located in non-sensitive areas; (ii) in the 10 SFEs&#13;
with biologically-sensitive areas in the Federation, project support would begin with ecological surveys of&#13;
which the results would be reflected in updated FMPs; (iii) the project would support the re-establishment&#13;
of normal surveillance and protection of the National Park of Sutjeska which entails the last remnant of&#13;
pristine forests in Bosnia; and (iv) institutional support, including technical assistance and training, would&#13;
be provided to SFEs in sensitive areas, to the management planning units in BH gume and Srpske gume,&#13;
and to the IPCHNH responsible for completing the ecological surveys on the sensitive areas.&#13;
76.    Soil and Waiter Conservation. Several measures would reduce the risk of accelerated erosion and&#13;
water degradation due to harvesting, which is significant in BH where the low density of forest roads leads&#13;
to long off-road transport. The system of selective felling and therefore few and small areas of clearfelling,&#13;
contains soil erosion problems. The risk of erosion will be further mitigated by proper planning to avoid&#13;
unsuitable sites during certain times of the year particularly when the ground is saturated with water. The&#13;
project includes training to support such planning.&#13;
D. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Responsibilities and Management&#13;
77.    Responsibilities. Project implementation would be the responsibility of:&#13;
(a) MOF / MAWF (in the Federation) and MAFW (in RS). Under the overall supervision of the&#13;
State-level Ministry of Finance (MOF) as the recipient of the IDA financing, the MAWF and the&#13;
MAFW would have overall responsibility for project implementation in the Federation and in RS&#13;
respectively. They would also be responsible, in particular, for carrying out the institutional and&#13;
fiscal and marketing studies funded under the project, and for implementing forest inspection&#13;
activities supported by the project, both at the central and local levels. The MAWF would also be&#13;
responsible for reforestation activities in the Federation and for the feasibility study for the creation&#13;
of the Igman Bjelasnica National Park;&#13;
(b) BH Sume (BHS) and Srpske Sume (S§). BHS and SS would be responsible for implementing&#13;
forest management planning activities and. forest protection from insect attacks funded under the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 20 of 27&#13;
project;&#13;
(c) SFEs. The Iumarstvos and Sumsko Gazdinstvos selected to participate in the project would be&#13;
responsible for implementing project activities under the "Rehabilitation of SFEs Operational&#13;
Capacity" component;&#13;
(d) Other Organizations. The IPCHNH would be responsible for carrying out the ecological&#13;
surveys of sensitive areas in the Federation SFEs; IPCHNH would also implement the monitoring&#13;
of the environmental impact of the project in the Federation; when necessary the IPCHNH would&#13;
sub-contract some of these activities to the University of Sarajevo. The Faculty of Forestry in the&#13;
University of Banja Luka would implement the monitoring of the environmental impact of the&#13;
project in RS. The National Park of Sutjeska would be responsible for project funded activities&#13;
in that Park; and&#13;
(e) Management. The PIUs, established under the MAWF and MAFW in the Federation and in RS&#13;
respectively, would be responsible for project management and monitoring (see para. 66).&#13;
Financing Mechanisms&#13;
78.   The State of BH would be the recipient of the funds from IDA, the EU and other potential donors.&#13;
As regards the IDA, subsidiary on-lending agreements would be made between the State and the Federation&#13;
and between the State and RS which would be represented in turn by the above mentioned PIUs. Actual&#13;
signature of the subsidiary agreement between the State and the Federation or between the State and RS&#13;
would be a condition of effectiveness of the project. The Ministries of Finance of the Federation and RS&#13;
would allocate funds for the purchase of equipment and services by the PIUs. As regards other potential&#13;
donors, appropriate arrangements would be established as soon as the corresponding financing&#13;
materializes.&#13;
79.   Equipment for mainly public purposes provided under the project to the MAWF, BHS, the&#13;
IPCHNH, and gumarstvos in the Federation, and to the MAFW, SS, and the gumsko Gazdinstvos in RS&#13;
would remain respectively Federation and RS State property.&#13;
80.   Supply and credit arrangements would be made to transfer the ownership of the following&#13;
equipment to the SFEs: forest road repair and maintenance equipment and wood transport equipment,&#13;
which have commercial purposes. The following terms for these supply and credit arrangements were&#13;
agreed upon with Federation and RS representatives during the negotiations of the IDA financing; they&#13;
would apply to the equipment funded by both IDA and the EU. These terms are based on the financial&#13;
assessment of project activities, carried out during project preparation (see Appendix 9). Based on a&#13;
review of the financial situation of some SFEs, it was also concluded that, despite the current delicate&#13;
transition period, the SFEs would be able to repay the supply and credit under these terms:&#13;
(a) the interest rate would be "LIBOR plus three percent", or 6.25 percent given the present LIBOR&#13;
rate;&#13;
(b) 1 year grace period would be applied for all equipment; and&#13;
(c) repayment would be made over 8 years for forest road repair and maintenance equipment, and 5&#13;
years for wood transport equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 21 of 27&#13;
81.    Credit repayment to either the Federation or RS would be through local credit institutions, selected&#13;
based on their fees, quality of services, and representation in local branches. The Bank and the EU would&#13;
be informed by the Govenunents of both the Federation and RS on the subsequent utilization by the latter&#13;
of the funds generated by the repayment of supply and credits.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
82.    The proposed procurement arrangements are summarized in the table below; they are in line with&#13;
the "Guidelines for procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published by the World Bank in&#13;
January 1995 and revised in January 1996 and August 1996. The proposed project procurement plan is&#13;
attached in Appendix 2. In the case of parallel financing (such as funding by the EU or by bilateral&#13;
donors), the applicable procurement procedures of the respective financiers would be applied.&#13;

83.    Goods. Only goods would be financed by IDA, and the following procurement procedures will be&#13;
followed:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 22 of 27&#13;
(a)   ICB. For procurement packages estimated to cost more than US$500,000 equivalent each&#13;
(financing amounting to US$5.95 million or 85% of IDA financing), International Competitive&#13;
Bidding (ICB) will be used. Regarding advertisement, a General Procurement Notice (GPN) will&#13;
be published in Development Business. The GPN will be followed by specific advertisements for&#13;
individual contracts in the local press. Bidding documents will be sent to suppliers who respond to&#13;
the GPN. For ICB packages, the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents will be used, to be&#13;
customized by the PIU and approved by the Bank prior to bidding.&#13;
(b) IS.  International Shopping (IS) will be used for procuring equipment estimated to cost&#13;
US$500,000 equivalent or less per contract. IS procedures are based on comparison of price&#13;
quotations obtained from at least three suppliers in two countries.&#13;
84.   Procurement Implementation Capacity. The services of external procurement experts (PEs),&#13;
who are experienced in Bank-financed procurement, may be engaged to assist the PIUs, since the Recipient&#13;
of the funds is likely to be short of the capacity essential for carrying out procurement of goods, works, and&#13;
services in the timely manner required, in particular if the PIUs have to apply different procedures for each&#13;
donor. The PEs would be responsible for carrying out procurement in accordance with the agreed&#13;
procedures for inspecting delivered goods, works and services, and for certifying payments in accordance&#13;
with contract conditions. The individual procurement advisors in the PIU would be responsible for day-to-&#13;
day coordination of procurement work. They would be responsible for contract management and&#13;
supervision, and for cooperation with the World Bank and PEs. Procurement training of PIU staff is&#13;
included under the project.&#13;
85.   Prior and Post Bank Review of Procurement Documents. Bank Standard Bidding Documents&#13;
will be used for ICB procurement packages. For IS, the documents and awards would require prior review&#13;
by the Bank for all contracts of US$300,000 and above. Technical specifications and data sheets of ICB&#13;
documents will require prior Bank review and approval.&#13;
86.   The Project Launch Workshop, which will ensure that the Borrower and implementation units&#13;
understand the procurement arrangements, will take place around effectiveness.  Post reviews of&#13;
procurement actions will be carried out on a quarterly basis by Bank supervision missions. Furthermore,&#13;
post review monitoring of procurement will be facilitated through quarterly reporting, which will be part of&#13;
the regular quarterly progress reports described further below. These reports would include, inter alia, the&#13;
type of items and value of procurement packages, the kind of procurement method followed, the numbers&#13;
and values of bids received, the name of the winning supplier, as well as the key dates of the bidding, award&#13;
and contract completion process.&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
87.   Disbursements are expected to be completed within a period of two and a half years from the date&#13;
of effectiveness. Total disbursements for the project would be US$0.7 million in FY99, US$14.4 million in&#13;
FY2000, and US$5.1 million in FY2001. Of these amounts, disbursements for the ITF Credit administered&#13;
by IDA would be US$0.3 million in FY99, US$4.9 million in FY2000, and US$1.8 million in FY2001.&#13;
88.   Disbursement categories are shown in Table 6 below. Disbursements against contracts for goods&#13;
exceeding US$500,000 would be made against standard documentation. For contracts below the above&#13;
thresholds, disbursements would be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs); the&#13;
appropriate documentation will be retained by the project management unit and kept available for&#13;
&#13;

"net oftaxes and duties&#13;
89.   Two Special Accounts denominated in US Dollars, one for the Federation and one for RS, would&#13;
be established in banks acceptable to the World Bank under terns and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
The authorized allocations to the Federation and to the RS Special Accounts would be US$800,000 and&#13;
US$400,000 respectively. The Special Accounts would be administered and replenished in accordance&#13;
with Bank guidelines.&#13;
Implementation Schedule&#13;
90.   A tentative schedule for project implementation is presented in Appendix 3, in line with the&#13;
procurement schedule presented in Appendix 2. The proposed schedule is assuming that: (i) the PIUs are&#13;
established in the Federation and in RS; and (ii) the first invitations to bid and/or quote would be released&#13;
by July 1, 1998. The delivery of the equipment necessary for forest surveillance by SFEs and to resume&#13;
forest management, including the re-establishment of forest inspectors and the rehabilitation of management&#13;
planning units in BH Sume and Srpske Sume, are scheduled for end-October 1998. The delivery of forest&#13;
road maintenance equipment, on one hand, and of transport equipment, on the other hand, are respectively&#13;
scheduled for the end of November and the end of December 1998. The project activities related to&#13;
protected areas development are expected to be completed by end-December 1999. The development of&#13;
forest management plans would be carried in 1998, 1999 and 2000; reforestation activities would take&#13;
place between early spring 1999 and early spring 2000.&#13;
Accounts, Auditing and Reporting&#13;
91.   Accounts. Separate and auditable accounts would be established with the PIUs within the MAWF&#13;
and the MAFW. These accounts would include: (i) a record of withdrawals on the Bank Credit with copies&#13;
of all disbursement requests and underlying documentation; and (ii) a record of transactions on the Special&#13;
Account and the copies of the bank statements on this account. Technical assistance to the PIUs has been&#13;
included under the project to establish proper accounts and financial controlling procedures.&#13;
92.   Audits of Project Account. The project accounts would be audited annually by independent&#13;
auditors and under termns of reference acceptable to the Bank, Separate audit statements would be prepared&#13;
for the Special Account and for SOEs. All audit reports would be made available to the Bank at the latest&#13;
six months after the end of the fiscal year. Project accounts would be maintained for one year after they&#13;
have been audited.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 24 of 27&#13;
93.   Audits of BH gume and Srpske Sume Accounts. The Bank and the Government agreed that the&#13;
Federation and RS shall cause BH Sume and Srpske gume respectively to maintain records and accounts&#13;
adequate to reflect their operations and financial condition in accordance with sound accounting practices.&#13;
In particular, they would have their records, accounts and financial statements (balance sheets, statements&#13;
of income and expenses and related statements) for each fiscal year audited, in accordance with appropriate&#13;
auditing principles consistently applied, by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The latter would&#13;
receive the audit reports as soon as available, but in any case not later than six months after the end of each&#13;
year.&#13;
94.    Reporting. The PIU will prepare and furnish to the Bank a quarterly progress report showing the&#13;
status of implementation of the project, including summary information on procurement contracts, as well&#13;
as a financial report in a format acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
95.    The project would support a simplified monitoring and evaluation program (see Appendix 8) aimed&#13;
at assessing project performance and the environmental, social and economic impacts of the project. Under&#13;
this program, the project would undertake regular monitoring of: (i) project funded inputs, including&#13;
physical and financial data on project support; (ii) project activities, including the use of project funded&#13;
inputs; and (iii) project output, including direct benefits arising out of project support. Informnation on&#13;
these indicators would be provided by the SFEs and the FISs, based on specifically designed&#13;
questionnaires. The PIUs would be responsible for collecting and collating information and preparing&#13;
regular progress reports -- quarterly in the case of project inputs and activities and bi-annually in the case&#13;
of project impact. The project would also undertake two studies to assess the wider impact of the project&#13;
on production, income and employment, including an impact assessment study, and a local economy study.&#13;
International expertise would be provided to help the PIUs design and test the questionnaire for SFEs and&#13;
FISs and write detailed terms-of-reference for the evaluation studies. These studies would be carried out&#13;
by a local university, research institute or Non-Governmental Organization for which local consultant&#13;
services would be funded under the project.&#13;
96.   The project would also support the preparation and execution of an environmental monitoring plan&#13;
(see Appendix 6). The objective of the plan is to monitor the environmental impacts of the project and&#13;
evaluate whether project activities are in compliance with project design and that mitigation measures are&#13;
achieving their desired effects. Indicators for environmental monitoring of the project would include:&#13;
change in natural vegetation, change in listed species, soil erosion and sediment transport parameters. The&#13;
IPHNH would be responsible for implementing the environmental monitoring plan in the Federation; the&#13;
Faculty of Forestry in the University of Banja Luka would have similar responsibility for RS.&#13;
E. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
97.    The project would have environmental benefits and would permit increased and sustained&#13;
production of wood 9; these benefits are discussed below:&#13;
The economic value of wood (conifers, export parity prices) has been estimated at about US$ 79/m3. Harvesting costs are estimated at US$&#13;
12.4/m3 and management costs at US$ 16.31m3. Thus the net economic value of wood is about US$ 50/m3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

(a) Technical support to analysis of policy changes would examine the implications of institutional&#13;
reforms and changes in marketing, pricing and trade, which would result in improved management&#13;
of forest resources and, eventually, in increased revenues to the State;&#13;
(b) The technical support to improved forest management planning would permit more timely&#13;
harvesting and maintenance of trees, improving the value of the product. Improved land-use&#13;
planning would also enhance the broader value of the forest by permitting better multi-functional&#13;
forest planning and use, categorizing forests into those with primarily sustainable production,&#13;
watershed protection, ecological or recreational purposes;&#13;
(c) Control of insect populations over 150,000 ha of highly infested forests would abate spreading of&#13;
insect attacks over 350,000 ha of coniferous high forests and prevent a significant destruction of&#13;
the standing stock, which would in turn prevent the loss in annual marketable production of at least&#13;
100,000 rn3 of logs. Reforestation in 500 ha of land susceptible to erosion would protect human&#13;
infrastructure from the risk of landslide. Technical and logistical support to development of the&#13;
protected areas system would improve management and landuse planning and enhance the&#13;
ecological and environmental value of these sensitive areas;&#13;
(d) The equipment for rehabilitation of forest roads funded under the project would permit&#13;
rehabilitation of about 4,000 kms of forest roads in high forests over an estimated 10 years. This&#13;
would benefit approximately 40,000 ha of high forest annually, making an estimated additional&#13;
annual amount of 400,000 rn3 of marketable wood in mature stands eventually available for&#13;
harvesting. This would also lower the cost of harvesting wood by reducing the required distance&#13;
for "skidding" wood from the harvest site to the roadside. The component also has two types of&#13;
environmental benefits. First, by reducing the skidding distance it reduces soil disturbance and&#13;
erosion in areas which are harvested. It also reduces damage to remaining stands and permits more&#13;
rapid regeneration. Second, by rehabilitating roads it permits geographically more balanced&#13;
harvesting, avoiding overharvesting at the (previously) limited accessible sites;&#13;
(e) The provision of transport equipment would permit extraction of sanitary fellings of about&#13;
120,000 rn3 per year, increasing also the growth rate and harvest value of the remaining healthy&#13;
growing stock. The nursery equipment would permit an increase in seedling production of about&#13;
6 million seedlings per year. The telecommunications equipment and vehicles would improve&#13;
overall forest management by permitting improved monitoring and earlier detection of illegal&#13;
harvesting and fires. It would also help ensure overall law enforcement and implementation of&#13;
management plans.&#13;
Economic Justification&#13;
98.   Most of the benefits of the project are environmental and could not be quantified and evaluated&#13;
against project costs. A contingency evaluation method would be an appropriate way of evaluating these&#13;
environmental benefits but, given the present situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, concepts such as&#13;
"willingness to pay" and "existence value" cannot be meaningfully estimated. In addition, a comprehensive&#13;
analysis of the commercial benefits derived from project support was not possible mainly because: (i) the&#13;
project was prepared under an emergency approach which did not allow for a comprehensive collection of&#13;
relevant data; and (ii) recent and reliable data on prices and marketing are scarce in a post-war country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 26 of 27&#13;
99.    However, a cursory economic analysis has been made (see Appendix 9) only for those project&#13;
activities where benefits could be approached -- with a reasonable level of confidence given the reliability&#13;
of available data -- in terms of increased production of wood (i.e., pulpwood, pit-props, and sawlogs) and&#13;
seedlings. The analysis deals with these benefits only and does not take into account other commercial&#13;
benefits (e.g., fuelwood, non-wood forest products); the analysis is based on very conservative assumptions&#13;
and considers a 10-year period only -- whereas a 50-year period is normally considered for investment in&#13;
forests -- since the project is by nature a reconstruction project from which benefits are mostly expected in&#13;
the short or medium terms. The activities analyzed are: (i) forest protection from insect attacks; (ii) forest&#13;
roads maintenance and repair; (iii) provision of wood transport equipment; and (iv) nursery rehabilitation.&#13;
The cost of project investments in these activities is US$9 million or 45 percent of total project cost. The&#13;
combined ERR for these activities is 59 percent.&#13;
Risks&#13;
100.  The risk of hostilities still exists in BH; however, as permanent political and administrative&#13;
institutions are gradually established and economic activities normalize, peace is expected to take hold and&#13;
consolidate over time. The project would contribute to this trend by supporting sustainable development of&#13;
a key sector in the Bosnian economy.&#13;
101.   The risk of delays in implementing the project should be considered, since such delays may reduce&#13;
the benefits of the project. This risk would be mitigated by: (i) the fact that PIUs are already established to&#13;
manage project activities; (ii) detailed preparation of implementation arrangements such as the early&#13;
selection of participating SFEs, and the early preparation of the technical specifications for the equipment;&#13;
(iii) swift deployment of the technical assistance; and (iv) the favorable conditions in the forestry sector&#13;
including the availability of skilled and experienced professionals and workers.&#13;
F. AGREEMENTS REACHED&#13;
102.  During negotiations of the Credit Agreement of the ITF administered by IDA, the following&#13;
agreements have been reached:&#13;
(a) equipment to rehabilitate the SFEs operational capacity financed under the Credit would be&#13;
supplied to SFEs selected in accordance with the agreed eligibility (paras. 62 to 64) and equipment&#13;
allocation criteria (para. 65) for the beneficiaries;&#13;
(b) the assignment of the field inspectors in the Federation and in RS would be completed by August&#13;
31, 1998 (para. 52);&#13;
(c) the Borrower would maintain the PIUs with adequate staffing to ensure timely and orderly project&#13;
implementation (para. 66);&#13;
(d) supply &amp; credit agreements between the PIUs and SFEs would be used, under the agreed tenrs and&#13;
conditions (para. 80);&#13;
(e) procurement would be carried out in a manner satisfactory to the Bank (paras. 82 to 86);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 27 of 27&#13;
(f) project accounting, audits and reporting would be carried out in a manner satisfactory to the Bank&#13;
(paras. 91, 92., and 94);&#13;
(g) the Federation and RS shall cause BH Sume and Srpske Sume respectively to maintain records and&#13;
accounts in accordance with sound accounting practices. In particular, their records, accounts and&#13;
financial statements would be audited for each fiscal year by independent auditors acceptable to the&#13;
Bank (para. 93).&#13;
(h) the IPCHNH and the Faculty of Forestry of the University of Banja Luka would be responsible,&#13;
respectively, for implementing the environmental monitoring plan in the Federation and in RS&#13;
(para. 96).&#13;
103.  The conditions of effectiveness of the IDA financing would be that:&#13;
(a) the subsidiary agreement between the State and the Federation or between the State and RS would&#13;
be signed (para. 78);&#13;
(b) the PlUs in the Federation and in RS would be appropriately staffed with forestry personnel (para.&#13;
66);&#13;
(c) the 1998 one-year work plans -- for the SFEs for which the forest management plan has expired&#13;
without being renewed - would be developed under provisions acceptable to IDA and approved at&#13;
the ministerial level (para. 63);&#13;
(d) in the case of the Federation, a draft new Forestry Law would be approved by the Government and&#13;
submitted to the Parliament of the Federation (para. 24).&#13;

Bosnia and Herzegovina&#13;
Forestry Project&#13;
Environmental Assessment Report&#13;
The following Environmental Assessment (EA) was carried out in 1996 when the main component of&#13;
the project supported wood harvesting. Since then, the project has been restructured to focus on&#13;
strengthening sustainable forest management, and no longer funds wood harvesting. Despite these&#13;
changes in project design, the EA continues to remain valid Its concerns and mitigation measures,&#13;
which address wood harvesting, are equally important as guidelines for sustainable forest&#13;
management. The original concerns and mitigation measures of the LA are, therefore, presented&#13;
here andfully incorporated in the project design.&#13;
For logistical reasons, the LA was carried out during project preparation at the level of the&#13;
Federation of BH only. Carrying out a subsequent and specific E£ for Republika Srpska (RS) was&#13;
not considered necessary since: (i) project activities in RS are of the same nature as in the&#13;
Federation, but more modest in scope; Cii) environmental conditions and policies in the Federation&#13;
and in RS are identical; and (iii) the present EA is mostly based on pre-war and Bosnia-wide&#13;
information.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 6&#13;

A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.        The proposed project would finance urgently needed investments in the forestry sector in&#13;
the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH). Forestry and related activities played an important&#13;
role, accounting for over 10% of Gross Social Product, but suffered tremendous damage as a&#13;
consequence of warfare. Reviving the sector is a high priority of the Government, especially in areas&#13;
where the local economy is heavily dependent on forest and wood industries and where there are good&#13;
forests which can be sustainably harvested. Project proposals, which focus on improving sustainable&#13;
forest management, were prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Forestry&#13;
(MAWRAF) with assistance provided by FAO/CP.&#13;
2.         Over 50% of the land area of the FBiH is covered with forests which play a critical&#13;
environmental role including: retention of soil and water, providing habitat to rare plant and animal&#13;
species, and creating scenic areas with tourism potential. It is essential that commercial wood&#13;
harvesting and processing give adequate attention to sustainable forest management and safeguarding of&#13;
important habitats and beauty spots. Since wood harvesting is resuming, there is a risk that this could&#13;
lead to loss of biodiversity and habitats; over-exploitation of forest areas with insufficient attention to&#13;
replanting; increased soil and water run-off, and deterioration of water quality downstream of forest&#13;
areas. During project preparation, special attention was given to assessing possible adverse&#13;
enviromnental effects and developing appropriate mitigation measures. However, due to the emergency&#13;
nature of the proposed project, screening and scoping of the environmental issues, as well as the&#13;
preparation of the present report, were carried out in parallel with preparation.&#13;
3.        In accordance with Bank's Operational Directive on Enviromnental Assessment (OD 4.01,&#13;
Annex A), the proposed project has been placed in Category "B", and thus required an Environmental&#13;
Assessment (EA) to be carried out. This EA report was based on a two week mission to the FBiH in&#13;
April/May 1996. In Sarajevo, meetings were held with key Government agencies, research institutes&#13;
and NGOs. The mission also visited different parts of the FBiH and met with local Govermnent&#13;
officials, state forest enterprises (Sumarstvos), wood processing industries, and private entrepreneurs&#13;
involved in wood harvesting and processing. Field visits were made to those forest areas which were&#13;
considered mine-safe to observe natural forest conditions and harvesting operations. The mission's&#13;
work was severely limited by the lack of adequate data. Much detailed information was destroyed by&#13;
the war and many Government agencies have no staff, buildings or records. It was particularly difficult&#13;
to obtain aggregate data for the FBiH as such an entity did not exist before the war. Data for the FBiH&#13;
have either been aggregated from lower level (Commune) data or derived from information about the&#13;
Republic as a whole. The mission had to rely heavily on data and information available from the pre-&#13;
war period, interviews with various experts, and field visits and discussions. Where possible, data from&#13;
different sources were cross-checked to ensure reliability.&#13;
4.         The present EA report consists of a description of: (i) existing environmental situation in&#13;
the project area; (ii) the policy, legal and administrative framework concerning environmental&#13;
protection; (iii) proposed project interventions; (iv) results from screening the potential adverse&#13;
environmental impact associated with project components; (v) recommended mitigation measures; and&#13;
(vi) a plan to monitor environmental impact and performance.&#13;

B. THE COUNTRY AND THE ENVIRONMENT&#13;
Location and Climate&#13;
5.         The Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (RBiH) is located in the south-eastern part of&#13;
Europe, bordering the Adriatic Sea and Croatia, and has a total area of 51,564 km2. The FBiH is&#13;
situated approximately between 420 30'N and 450 N latitude and between 160 E and 190 E longitude,&#13;
and covers approx. 26,500 km2. The greater part of the FBiH is hilly or mountainous, with altitudes&#13;
ranging between sea level and 2,300 m (average altitude is 500 m). It is located in the very centre of&#13;
the mountain line of Dynarids, between the Adriatic and the Panonija lowlands. About 5% of the&#13;
RBiH's land is flat; 24% is hilly; 42% is mountainous; and 29% is "Karst" land (rocky land). Lying&#13;
largely in the southern part of the temperate zone, but subjected to cold continental air currents from&#13;
the north, the country experiences a wide climatic variation determined mainly by altitude but also&#13;
influenced appreciably by the continental air movements of eastern and northern Europe. The hilly and&#13;
mountainous part of the country has a continental climate with cold winters. The hinterland of the&#13;
Dalmatian coast (Croatia) and the territory around the small coastal town of Neum have a&#13;
Mediterranean climate. Precipitation varies widely, ranging from 1000 to 1900 mm annually, and&#13;
occurs mostly at the end of the autumn.&#13;
Forests&#13;
6.         Extent and Condition: In the whole of the RBiH, 53% of the total land area is forested.&#13;
The forest area is remarkable not only for its extent but also for its rich variety. The majority (1.6&#13;
million ha) is deciduous. Only a little over 100,000 ha is pure coniferous forests, while 600,000 ha is&#13;
mixed, including conifers and beech (E.I.U., 1995). In the FBiH the state-owned enterprises have&#13;
reported approximately 500,000 ha of high forests" , part of which are conifers (fir and spruce; or&#13;
beech, fir and spruce)'" . The forests are biologically in good condition. Until 1988, the former&#13;
Yugoslavia had registered none of the extensive forest damage due to air pollution (acid rain) that has&#13;
affected the neighbouring countries to the north. However, there were localised problems reported in&#13;
some areas. In 1992, high emissions of S02 were reported, mainly in the towns of Zenica (from the&#13;
steelworks) and Kakanj (from the thermal power plant), with pronounced ill effects on health of the&#13;
local population. Other less important sources of S02 emissions were the thermal power plants in Tuzla&#13;
and Ugljevik. However, no data are available on the forest damage caused by the sustained deposition&#13;
of S02. Anecdotal evidence suggests there has been substantial damage in the areas surrounding&#13;
Zenica.&#13;
7.        Standing Stock and Harvesting: It was not possible at this time to assess whether the&#13;
standing stock is at an optimal level. Growing stock is presently estimated at about 200 m3/ha in the&#13;
High forests with natural regeneration considered by the national forestry institutions as high quality&#13;
production forests are divided into four sub-categories:&#13;
beech forests;&#13;
.mixed forests: fir and spruce; or beech, fir and spruce;&#13;
white and black pine forests; and&#13;
oak forests.&#13;
2/  A detailed classification of forest and forest land in RBiH is presented in Attachment 3 of Appendix 7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 6&#13;
Page 4 of 25&#13;
state owned high forest. According to some sources this is below optimal levels and the present policy&#13;
of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is to increase the current growing stock to 300 m3/ha. The&#13;
Institute of Cultural, Historical and Natural Heritage (IPNH)1' has stated that average growing stock of&#13;
wood decreased from 600 to its present level of 200m3/ha over the last 100 years. Interviews with&#13;
officials of the IPNH, indicate that "scientific studies and experience on forest management in spruce,&#13;
fir and beech forests has identified a growing stock of 300400 m3/ha as economically satisfactory". On&#13;
the other hand there are factors which suggest that the forests are relatively well stocked. In the RBiH,&#13;
the Annual Allowable Cut (AAC) over the period 1981-90 was 6.8 million m3 which was well below&#13;
the Mean Annual Increment (MAI) of 9.1 million m3 for the same period. More importantly the actual&#13;
cut over the 1980s averaged some 6.2 million rn3, equivalent to 91% of the AAC and 68% of the MAI.&#13;
The last surveys carried out before the war (in 1990) projected that the MAI over the 1990s would&#13;
increase to 10.5 million m3, which indicates increasing forest productivity.&#13;
8.        Although detailed information is not available, it is estimated that the AAC in the FBiH is&#13;
around 3.7 million m3. A survey of wood harvesting units in the FBiH indicate that actual harvesting&#13;
was only a fraction (32%) of the AAC. However, there is evidence of excessive logging near towns and&#13;
roadsides and of war damage along the confrontation lines.&#13;
9.        A comparison of standing stock in FBiH (200 m3/ha) with other countries in the region&#13;
also suggests a relatively high level of standing stock:&#13;
Country   Solid volume over bark per ha&#13;
(m3)&#13;
Bulgaria   122&#13;
Romania   218&#13;
Poland     160&#13;
Croatia    145 (234 in state owned exploitable high forests)&#13;
Albania    78 (133 in state owned exploitable high forests)&#13;
Estonia    114 (235 in mature even aged stands)&#13;
Slovakia   183 (400 in even aged stands 70-100 years old)&#13;
10.       Forestry Management: Production forestry in the FBiH has a long history, dating back to&#13;
around 1878, when the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy came to control the region. Currently the&#13;
dominant system is "selective felling" which has been practised in RBiH since 1968. In contrast to the&#13;
more common system of forest management with aims at creating even aged forests, this system aims at&#13;
creating stands containing trees in all age classes. Harvesting take place at regular intervals (about&#13;
every 10th year), and includes the felling of mature, dead and damaged trees and a cross section in all&#13;
age classes at a level which ensures that the same amount, quality and species distribution would be&#13;
available at the following harvesting interval. Clearfelling is not allowed, unless it is required to&#13;
improve degraded forest. The majority of the forests are naturally regenerated in BiH. The system is&#13;
highly conducive to conservation of biodiversity, since the diversity of natural stands is maintained to&#13;
the maximum extent possible.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 6&#13;

11.        War Damage: Large forest areas have been mined along the confrontation lines. It is&#13;
estimated that 10-20% of the total area is contaminated by mines of different types. During the war,&#13;
some areas close to roads and population centres have been cut for fuelwood. Illegal cutting has also&#13;
occurred in the high forests by the different armies. Timber resources have also been damaged by forest&#13;
fires and shrapnel during hostilities. The damages on trees caused by the war have resulted in increased&#13;
insect population, creating a potential for significantly larger damage in the future.&#13;
12.        Soil and Water Related Problems: Data on soil quality and erosion are available in the&#13;
Forest Management Plans (FMPs) and other documents (e.g., Faculty of Forestry, 1983). Although it&#13;
was not possible to translate and review all reports, it appears that there are a number of problems&#13;
related to soil and water retention but many of these could likely be addressed through better forestry&#13;
harvesting practices. Forest harvesting in steep areas is common in BiH and results in erosion and&#13;
downstrearn water degradation. This happens particularly in areas where there is a low density of forest&#13;
roads which requires excessive off-road transport. The system of selective felling requires few and&#13;
small areas of clear felling and this generally reduces soil erosion problems. The risk of erosion could&#13;
be further mitigated by proper planning to avoid unsuitable sites during certain times of the year when&#13;
the ground is saturated with water.&#13;
Wildlife and Protected Areas&#13;
13.        Bosnia's forests represent an important genetic bank. There are and estimated 401 rare&#13;
species of flora and over 200 rare species of fauna. The government organisation for wildlife&#13;
protection" is finishing the preparation of the flora "listed species", i.e., the list of species which are&#13;
either threatened or endangered. On the aforementioned 401 flora species list, around 10 species are&#13;
considered endangered. Of major significance is the promulgation of this list ("Flora Red List Book of&#13;
BiH") to protect the species from activities which may impact their continued protection and survival.&#13;
Concerning the protection of fauna, the government intends to start with the preparation of the "Fauna&#13;
Red List Book" as soon as the "Flora Red List Book" is completed. The major threatened species are&#13;
predatory birds (nine of them are endangered) and aquatic birds (five are considered endangered).&#13;
Besides the aforementioned nine birds living in terrestrial ecosystems, there are 153 more singing birds&#13;
and birds useful for forestry and agriculture, as well as 66 aquatic birds. The endangering of one&#13;
mammal (Dolomys marakovici Bolkay) and two amphibians is of great concern among the scientists.&#13;
During the war, a large population of bears left the country to other forests in Slovenia and Croatia.&#13;
Some are coming back, but the risk of crossing mined areas is high. All the aforementioned birds and a&#13;
large number of small mammals is going to be included in the "Fauna Red List Book".&#13;
14.        Places of genetic and scenic interest are protected in line with a Law for Protection of&#13;
Natural Heritage (1985). Protected Areas are classified into three categories:&#13;
-      Natural Parks and Natural Areas, divided into three sub-categories: National&#13;
Parks; Parks of Nature (ecologically sensitive areas and natural beauties of&#13;
regional interest); and Complexes of Natural Beauties.&#13;

Nature Reserves, of local interest, divided into two sub-categories: General/strict&#13;
Reserves (for the protection of the whole ecosystem); and Special Reserves (for&#13;
the protection of one of a few species).&#13;
Monuments of Nature and Areas with Endangered Species of flora and/or fauna.&#13;
15.   National Parks and Reserves: In the RBiH's there were 31 protected areas ", including&#13;
two national parks - the National Park of "Sutjeska", with an area of 17,250 ha, including the&#13;
biggest primary forest of Europe (1,434 ha); and the National Park of "Kozara", with an area&#13;
of 3,375 ha. About 1% of the territory was protected, which is lower than international norms.&#13;
In 1980, it was proposed that 4% of the Republic's territory be set aside as protected areas. In&#13;
the same year, an environmental strategy was developed to increase this to 16% by the year&#13;
2000. Between 1980 and the beginning of the war, a number of studies were carried out and&#13;
some new areas were identified and studied. One of these new areas is located near Sarajevo -&#13;
the Mountains of Treskavica and Bjelasnica - where a National Park of 570 km a was planned.&#13;
This area contains endemic species of flora and fauna; glacial phenomena and a spectacular&#13;
landscape. Due to the war situation and subsequent division of the Republic into two entities,&#13;
the 4% strategy was not attained nor is it likely that the 16% strategy will be attained in year&#13;
2,000. Most of the protected areas of the RBiH, including the two national parks, are in the&#13;
Republika Srpska. The FBiH has only three small virgin/primary forests (total area of 375 ha)&#13;
and three small reserves (420 ha).&#13;
16.   The Treskavica and Bjelasnica National Park: The national park project was stopped&#13;
due to resource use conflicts in the forested area. During the war, intensive military operations&#13;
took place in the area and a large part was damaged or mined. In view of these problems IPNH&#13;
has temporarily suspended the idea of a national park in the area and is instead studying the&#13;
possibility of creating a new national park located near the border of Bosnia with Herzegovina -&#13;
the mountains of Preni, Cursnica and Cabulja - with an area of 994,5 km 2 (1.9% ofthe&#13;
Republic area). About 20% of the 401 endemic flora species of the Republic exists in this area,&#13;
including some rare species of pine and fir. It is a refuge for rare plants and a centre of the&#13;
Dynarid region. The local geomorphology is very impressive and includes very deep canyons.&#13;
To date a draft document has been produced along with maps on preliminary ecological zoning,&#13;
forest types and political boundaries. It is the aim of the government that this Park be included&#13;
in the UNESCO's list of world inheritances.&#13;
Other Parks of Nature: In addition, Parks of Nature have been proposed by the IPNH in the&#13;
following mountainous forest areas within the boundaries of the Federation): Zvijezda (approx.&#13;
v Two National Parks (20,625 ha); one Park of Nature (2,000 ha); four small virgin forest reserves (total&#13;
area of 570 ha); one large virgin forest reserve inside a National Park (1,434 ha); three small forest&#13;
reserves (total area of 597 ha); fourteen very small special reserves (total area of 269 ha) ; and six&#13;
parks of forest (total area of 1,459 ha).&#13;
&#13;

1,500 ha); Tajan (approx. 2,000 ha); Vranica (includes a lake - 8,000 ha); Vlasic (approx.&#13;
5,000 ha) and Sator (approx. 5,000 ha).&#13;
Water Resources&#13;
17.       The territory of the RBiH is bounded by the Sava, Drina and Una rivers. The most&#13;
important river is the Sava, which originates in Slovenia, flowing through the agricultural flatlands of&#13;
Croatia and Bosnia before entering the Danube at Belgrade. The Sava forms the northern border of the&#13;
RBiH and there are a number of fertile lowlands. Some 9 million people live in the Sava watershed and&#13;
the area produced about 25% of the total agricultural yield and 60% of total industrial output in the&#13;
former Yugoslavia (Pravidic, 1992). The town of Sarajevo, which is in the south-west, is near the&#13;
head-waters of the River Bosna, an affluent of the River Sava. Within the border of the FBiH, the&#13;
major rivers are: Una, Sana and Bosna in the northern and central part(tributaries of the Sava river);&#13;
and the Neretva river in the south which flows into the Adriatic Sea. Most of Herzegovina is&#13;
mountainous and infertile although there are number of valleys which are productive&#13;
18.       Water Quality: The most pressing water quality problems in the RBiH relate to the Sava&#13;
River. Regulations require that water in rivers should be rated Class 2 (suitable for bathing and fish&#13;
farming). The Sava's water is mostly Class 3 (suitable for irrigation and industrial use) and in several&#13;
places Class 4 (requiring special treatment prior to any use). The problem of agricultural runoff&#13;
(intensive use of fertiliser and chemical fertiliser, mainly before the war) has been recognised as a&#13;
major threat to drinking-water supplies (Pravidic, 1992). In the FBiH, the most pressing problem&#13;
relates to the Bosna river, downstream from the industrial towns of Zenica and Kakanj, where&#13;
wastewater discharge from factories and the city is causing pollution. The FBiH does not seem to suffer&#13;
from acute eutrophication of lakes, except in a few locations where topography and stream-flow&#13;
concentrate natural runoff.&#13;
Human and Economic Development&#13;
19.       Population: Before the war, the population of the RBiH was about 4.5 million inhabitants&#13;
(1990)". Today it is estimated that over one million live abroad and another 1.5 million people are&#13;
refugees within the country. The former Yugoslavia was the most ethnically diverse of the East&#13;
European states and no single ethnic group constituted an overall majority. In the FBiH the main&#13;
groups are the ethnic Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks) and the Croats. Due to the severe disruption caused&#13;
by the war, there are no detailed statistics about the present population.&#13;
20.       The Economy and the Agricultural Sector: The economy of RBiH developed rapidly after&#13;
the Second World War. It has a variety of mineral resources, both coniferous and deciduous forests,&#13;
and hydroelectric power. The largest companies were socially owned under the former Yugoslavia's&#13;
self-management system, but there were also a large number of small private companies. Agriculture&#13;
was the main livelihood for about half of RBiH's population. In 1990, 1.6m ha were farmed, of which&#13;
about a third was under crops, a third meadow or fallow and a third pasture (E.I.U., 1995). Much of&#13;
the country is forested and too mountainous to be easily farmed, so production of the main cereal crops&#13;
(wheat and maize) reached only 30-40% of levels reached in Croatia, which had a similar area and&#13;
' Source: Annual Statistics Book.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 6&#13;
Page 8 of 25&#13;
population size. Livestock numbers for cattle, sheep and poultry were relatively higher, although still&#13;
lower than in Croatia. Forestry was an economic sector of considerable importance, with 22,000&#13;
foresters employed directly in 1990 and considerably more in the manufacture of wood products&#13;
(E.I.U., 1995).&#13;
21.       Other Productive Sectors: There is a long tradition of mining, based on the country's&#13;
substantial reserves of coal, iron ore, lead, bauxite, zinc, barytes, rock salt and ceramics. Bosnia is rich&#13;
in hydropower capacity, which was exploited to produce 19 bn kwh per year before the war. Coal is&#13;
produced domestically, but oil and gas have to be imported. While some of the country's industry are&#13;
the heavy industries characteristic of eastern Europe (e.g., the iron and steel company in Zenica), there&#13;
are substantial wood working, textiles, ceramics and electronics industries as well. A large portion of&#13;
the industrial sector was damaged during the war.&#13;
C. LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS&#13;
The Legal Framework&#13;
22.       Environmental Legislation in the pre-war period: In the former Yugoslavia, the&#13;
constituent Republics had a high degree of autonomy to manage many of their internal affairs, leaving&#13;
the federal government a very limited set of powers. In the environmental area the federal government&#13;
had jurisdiction only in international or inter-Republic matters. Most Republics developed some form of&#13;
environmental administration and regulations and at one time there were some 400 laws and 1,000&#13;
regulations covering environmental protection (Pravdic, 1993). The republics were given jurisdiction&#13;
over both federal and republican environmental enforcement organs (Article 286 of the former&#13;
Yugoslavia Constitution). This system also gave considerable scope to the communes for the protection&#13;
of the local environment through the passing of regulations and the planning and implementation of&#13;
environmental control systems.&#13;
23.       Budgetary Regulations: Local government units were required by law to be self-&#13;
supporting. All funds for local social welfare programmes and public services had to be raised locally.&#13;
Many local services were mandatory, and local government and industry had substantial portions of&#13;
their budget allocated to these mandatory activities. Environmental protection was not a mandated&#13;
public service. As a consequence, environmental programmes could not depend on a public source of&#13;
permanent funding and there was little incentive to undertake costly environmental improvements. An&#13;
example, resulting from this system, is the high level of pollution in the river Bosna, where significant&#13;
amounts of domestic solid waste and industrial effluents are discharged.&#13;
24.       Forestry Regulation in the pre-war Period: In contrast to the aforementioned&#13;
environmental issues (water pollution, solid waste disposal and air pollution), it appears that forest&#13;
protection was covered by a well-developed system of inspection at the commune level which was&#13;
monitored by the national government. Before the war, every commune of the RBiH had an inspector&#13;
to monitor the implementation of its respective Forest Management Plan (FMP). The inspectors, who&#13;
were all qualified forest engineers, had the authority to stop illegal operations in the forests and to&#13;
apply fines in cases of violations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 6&#13;
Page 9 of 25&#13;
25.       The Legal Framework in RBiH: Currently, there is no "Environmental Law", but sectoral&#13;
laws which partly cover environmental protection. There are three major laws containing environmental&#13;
provisions:&#13;
the Natural Heritage Law (issued in 1985, concerning the establishment and&#13;
management of protected areas);&#13;
-the Water Resources Law; and&#13;
-      the Forest Law (issued in 1978, which basically defines rules for production&#13;
forestry but also includes aspects on forest protection).&#13;
26.   New laws on lan d use, environmental protection and forest are currently being drafted.&#13;
The new Environmental Law will draw together and strengthen the environmental provisions&#13;
contained in the existing sectoral laws. Under this new law, a series of regulations on water,&#13;
air and natural resources management will be promulgated, including emission and&#13;
environmental quality standards for the control of water and air pollution, and the&#13;
establishment of the environmental inspection system. Based on the experience in the other&#13;
former Yugoslavian republics it is expected that environmental legislation will be formulated to&#13;
be in compliance with the EU and agreed international conventions.&#13;
The Institutional Framework&#13;
27.       There are four major bodies concerned with environmental protection and forestry in the&#13;
FBiH. The primary responsibility for environmental matters rest with the Ministry of Planning,&#13;
Construction and Environmental Protection (MPCEP) and the institute for the Preservation of&#13;
Historical, Cultural and Natural Heritage (IPNH). Institutions that have responsibility for forestry&#13;
include: the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Forestry (MAWAF), and the state owned&#13;
company BH Sume (Bosanskoherzegovacke Sume) which oversees all state owned forests.&#13;
28.       The MPCEP: The primary responsibility of this Ministry, which is also represented at&#13;
Federation level, concerns policy formulation and implementation of environmental regulations. Within&#13;
MPCEP, there is a Vice-Minister of Environment and an Environmental Department. This&#13;
Environmental Department is divided into four recently created Divisions: (i) General Environmental&#13;
Protection; (ii) Ecosystems' Protection; (iii) Forest Protection; and (iv) Inspection and Enforcement.&#13;
The MPCEP is new in the field of environmental protection and has very little staff and funds. Most of&#13;
the operational divisions still do not have any staff, but the government is starting to contract&#13;
professionals. The MPCEP has ambitious plans in environmental monitoring but its functions and role&#13;
would become more definitive after the approval of the Environmental Law.&#13;
29.       The IPNH: The IPNH is under the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture and is in&#13;
charge of creating and managing protected areas (National Parks, Parks of Nature, Reserves, etc.). Its&#13;
scientific and administrative work need to fulfil the requirements of the "Natural Heritage Law". It&#13;
works closely with the MPCEP. Currently there are 29 persons employed in the IPNH (23&#13;
professionals, 1 technician and 6 administrative workers). Among the 23 professionals, two experts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 6&#13;
Page 10 of 25&#13;
(one forester/botanist and one geographer/zoologist) work full time in scientific research programs, the&#13;
result of which is reflected in the preparation of the management plans of protected areas.&#13;
30.        MAWAF: As the technical ministry in charge of forestry, the MAWAF has functions&#13;
relating to planning, policy and development. The main executive arm of the MAWAF, with respect to&#13;
environmental aspects is the Forest Inspection Service (FIS) which has a policing function to enforce&#13;
the forest legislation and regulations. The FIS is decentralised at the commune/local level and the&#13;
MAWAF is responsible for monitoring the local system of inspection. Due to the war situation, the FIS&#13;
has been largely disrupted and now there is a lack of inspectors and equipment (vehicles) to execute the&#13;
service.&#13;
31.        BH Sume: Presently BH Sume" and the Sumarstvos control 577,000 ha of forests and are&#13;
responsible for day to day management of these areas. BH Sume is expected to guide and control the 45&#13;
Sumarstvos which operate in the FBiH and ensure that they abide by regulations and implement&#13;
management plans. The Sumarstvos, based on the old" forest enterprises, are in charge of forest&#13;
exploitation, transportation and distribution of wood to the consumer (fuelwood to domestic consume&#13;
and industrial wood to processing plants. BH Sume is presently not fully staffed and its final status and&#13;
relation to regional authorities (Cantons) is not yet decided. A new law regulating state owned&#13;
companies is also under preparation.&#13;
D. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
32.   The objective of the project is to resume sustainable management and protection of&#13;
Bosnian forest resources, in order to: (i) ensure the sustainablility of the rapid recovery of the&#13;
wood harvesting and wood processing sectors; and (ii) control the potential environmental&#13;
impact of the latter.&#13;
Project Activities&#13;
The project would have the following four components:&#13;
Support to Forest Management. The project would provide support to (i) developing policy&#13;
reforms on the basis of two studies on the institutional aspects, and the fiscal and marketing aspects&#13;
of the forestry sector; (ii) resuming the preparation of Forest Management Plans by re-establishing&#13;
forest inventory and management planning units; and (iii) restoring Forest Inspection Services&#13;
(FISs).&#13;
"/ Under the MAWRF.&#13;
21 Before the war, all forest enterprises included production forestry and wood processing industries. Those&#13;
two sub-sectors are now divided into two enterprises: forestry and wood processing respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 6&#13;
Page 11 of 25&#13;
&#149; Protection and Rehabilitation of Forests. The project would support (i) a comprehensive program to&#13;
control insect attacks on Bosnian forests, mostly bark beetles on coniferous species; (ii) reforestation of&#13;
about 500 ha in areas heavily damaged during the war; and (iii) the development of protected areas&#13;
including the restoration of existing areas and the development of new areas.&#13;
* Rehabilitation of SFEs Operational Capacity. The project would restore the operational capacity&#13;
of selected SFEs by restoring pre-war accessibility to the forests and providing SFEs and their staff&#13;
with the equipment necessary to resume normal surveillance and protection of forests, carry out&#13;
forest regeneration and other silvicultural works, and organize and control sustainable forest&#13;
harvesting.&#13;
* Project Management and Monitoring. Project funds would be allocated to project management&#13;
and to a system to monitor and evaluate the project's environmental and economic impact.&#13;
E. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS&#13;
33.        In this chapter the environmental impacts likely to result from the ongoing recovery of&#13;
wood harvesting activities and from implementing the project are described. The environmental analysis&#13;
has been divided into two aspects: forest harvesting and road rehabilitation. It should be stressed that&#13;
the analysis of foret harvesting has emphasised (i) the potential adverse impacts of harvesting operations&#13;
on forest habitats; and (ii) issues associated with the institutional capacity for environmental monitoring&#13;
and the adequacy of the legal and judicial system to enforce existing legislation.&#13;
Forest Harvesting Aspects&#13;
34.        The following potential significant environmental impacts associated  with timber&#13;
harvesting activities were identified:&#13;
Impact: Unsustainable forest management due to lack of institutional capacity both to update the&#13;
Forest Management Plans and to monitor their implementation&#13;
35.        Over the last 30 years, the former Forest Planning Department" built up a system of basic.&#13;
information for forest management planning purposes. The Forest Management Plans (FMPs) were&#13;
prepared for each forest management unit every ten to twenty years. The existing FMPs have been&#13;
prepared according to generally accepted standards/methods (they have been evaluated regarding their&#13;
sustainability, i.e., existing plans are adequate for sustainable forestry - see Technical Annex and&#13;
Appendix 7). The plans include environmental information on geology, soils, vegetation, forest&#13;
protection and water resources. But issues on wildlife are limited to information provided by the&#13;
" Until 1990, this Department was under the holding company for forest industries - SIPAD. It became&#13;
then an independent Bureau but its facilities were largely destroyed during the war. The small&#13;
number of remaining staff are now employed in the state owned forest company (BH Sume) that&#13;
manages in principle all state owned forests within the Federation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 6&#13;
Page 12 of 25&#13;
Hunting Associations (Hunting Plans). To balance the environmental costs and values of the updated&#13;
FMPs in the future, all appropriate stakeholders should be included in the preparation of those plans&#13;
(specialists in flora and fauna from the scientific institutions; the environmental agencies within the&#13;
Bosnian government, particularly the Ministry of Planning and Environment; NGO's and local&#13;
population). The existing system includes the participation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry&#13;
and the Assemblies of local Communes.&#13;
36.        FMPs are seen as a critical project element that will require cooperative efforts by an&#13;
interdisciplinary team. The majority of FMPs (53%) have expired in the last five years and were not&#13;
updated due to the war situation. The currently-valid FMPs will expire before the year 2,003. During&#13;
the war, the forests were not managed according to these plans. Most forest harvesting and wood&#13;
processing units were damaged and the sector was operating at a fraction of its capacity. However, in&#13;
the confrontation lines within the forests and in some small areas near towns and main roads there has&#13;
been excessive cutting. The government office responsible for FMPs plans was largely destroyed.&#13;
Based on information collected in the field" , there appear to have occurred undesirable harvesting&#13;
practices before the war.&#13;
37.        The well-developed Forest Inspection Service (FIS) at the commune level has been largely&#13;
disrupted by the war. The majority of the forest inspectors are no longer employed in these positions&#13;
and there are a significant number of communes where harvesting activities are not inspected" . The&#13;
analysis of the existing situation suggests that a serious threat faces forest sustainability because of&#13;
unsupervised harvesting activities.&#13;
Impact: Harvesting of Biologically-rich Forested Areas (potential to reduce the habitat and to&#13;
decrease biodiversity)&#13;
38.        Based on information collected in the field" there are biologically sensitive forest habitats&#13;
in the areas listed on Table 1 and on Map 1. These areas represent 4.2 % of the FBiH's territory. As&#13;
mentioned in Chapter B, only about 1% of the Republic's territory is protected which is much lower&#13;
than international norms. In 1980, it was proposed that 4% of the Republic's territory be set aside as&#13;
protected areas. Due to the war situation and subsequent division of the Republic into two entities, the&#13;
4% strategy was not attained. Most of the protected areas of the RBiH, including the two national&#13;
parks, are in the Republika Srpska. The FBiH has only three small areas of primary forests (total area&#13;
of 375 ha) ) and three small reserves (420 ha).&#13;
39.        As mentioned above, some 30 Sumarstvos have been identified to receive project support.&#13;
Based on an initial screening, 10 of these appear to be in critical habitat and rich biodiversity areas (see&#13;
Table 1 and Map 1). Small portions of those areas (possibly between 2% to 10% of the Sumarstvos&#13;
" Through interviews with the MPCEP; the IPNH; directors of Sumarstvos; and local officials.&#13;
2'  In Herzegovina, for example, there were 18 forest inspectors before the war (data provided by the director&#13;
of Grahovo's Sumarstvos who worked as an inspector until 1995). Now there are only four.&#13;
3/  Back ground reports; official documents presented by the federal government; and interviews with&#13;
representatives of (i) government institutions for environmental protection; (ii) universities and (iii)&#13;
NGO's.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 6&#13;

area) have been proposed by the federal government to be designated as protected" areas (see Table 1).&#13;
A small portion of those 2% to 10% would possibly be closed to logging in the future if so warranted,&#13;
due to presence of critical habitat and high biodiversity. Nevertheless, due to (i) data constraints; (ii)&#13;
lack of institutional capacity to monitor the implementation of FMPs; and (iii) existing post war&#13;
situation, it is unclear what the existing status of these biologically significant areas are and what the&#13;
impact of logging operations may signify. There is a potential risk that ongoing and recovering could&#13;
contribute to increas-ed offtake in forested areas which are critical for protecting the country&#13;
biodiversity with unknown consequences.&#13;
Impact: Soil erosion&#13;
40.        There is a potential threat to soil erosion caused by log transport operations on skidding&#13;
trails and by clearing sites and harvesting: the magnitude of the impact will depend mainly on the road&#13;
density, type of soil and on slopes' inclination, and the timing of site preparation to harvesting. Such&#13;
work in (i) rainy days and (ii) just after the thawing period will cause more damages . In addition to&#13;
soil erosion, the aforementioned operations may cause degradation of downstream water quality and&#13;
sedimentation of natural drainage ways and rivers.&#13;
Impact: Loss of slope stability&#13;
41.        There is a potential risk of slope stability loss from timber harvesting activities on steep&#13;
lands and the associated difficulty of reestablishing forest cover on these slopes. Due to the roadcuts&#13;
across sloping terrain and clearing of vegetation on the slopes promoting landslides.&#13;
Road Rehabilitation Aspects&#13;
42.        The existing forest road network is 9,851 km of which some 3,366 Km of roads need to be&#13;
repaired. The rehabilitation would consist of small-scale operations confined to regrading, filling of&#13;
potholes, rebuilding of the surface of the road and correction of drainage problems. There are official&#13;
regulations and guidelines for forest road construction and maintenance in the RBiH, with very detailed&#13;
specitifations on forest road construction and rehabilitation. Part of those regulations were translated.&#13;
During the few field trips on forest roads at the time of the assessment, the proposed improvements&#13;
would not appear to present serious erosion problems, following in general the contour of mountains&#13;
and attaining some other technical aspects which prevent environmental problems.&#13;
The sediment yield in the rivers appears to be relatively low (according to visual&#13;
observations made during the time of the assessment). A review of existing forest road construction and&#13;
rehabilitation standards, together with spot field surveys, indicates that no further mitigation measure&#13;
will be required. Although no measures will be required, monitoring of erosion associated with road&#13;
repair to be supported under the project is included in the Environmental Monitoring Plan.&#13;
Nevertheless, the list of specific impacts presented below should be considered illustrative of the&#13;
possible environmental issues associated a project of this nature.&#13;
According to the natural resources law (law for protection of natural heritage, issued in 1985), when a&#13;
Protected Area is proposed, it is reclassified into a category of pre-protection until the Protected Area&#13;
is created by law).&#13;

F. MITIGATION PLAN&#13;
45.       In Chapter E the potential environmental impacts of the project were presented. Chapter F&#13;
proposes the mitigatiion measures, including institutional arrangements, and implementation schedules.&#13;
As a general remark it should be mentioned that a number of mitigating measures were incorporated in&#13;
project design.&#13;
Forest Harvesting Aspects&#13;
Impact: Unsustainable Forest Management&#13;
Proposed mitigating measures: Strengthen existing inspection systems and update FMPs&#13;
with the inclusion of ecological surveys and recommendations on mitigation for flora and fauna&#13;
protection.&#13;
46.        The project would strengthen the existing Forest Inspection System (FIS) to ensure that the&#13;
forests will be managed according to the FMPs and that project activities are in compliance with&#13;
existing national policies. The institutional strengthening activities would cover provision of equipment,&#13;
technical assistance and training of forest inspectors for each of the 10 cantons of the Federation.&#13;
47.   The strengthening of the FIS would focus both on central and local/canton forestry&#13;
inspection systems, with the majority of the resources being allocated to the local/canton level.&#13;
The technical assistance (three persons-month of local expertise) would consist of developing a&#13;
proposal for FIS that would cover all Sumarstvos supported under the project (in the very&#13;
beginning of the project). Terms of Reference for the aforementioned technical assistance is&#13;
presented in Attachment 2. Training is estimated for 30 FIS staff. In addition to the basic&#13;
concepts and procedures of forest inspection on production forests, the training should include&#13;
some other aspects such as (i) forest and habitat protection; (ii) sustainable forestry&#13;
management; and (iii) good-practices for road repair and improvement, depending on the&#13;
specific needs of the areas covered by the project. This measure has been included in project&#13;
design as a sub-component (Support to Forest Inspection) of the component "Support to Forest&#13;
Management".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 6&#13;
Page 15 of 25&#13;
48.         FMPs would be updated according to the recommendations listed in Appendix 7. In&#13;
addition those plans shall include results from floral and fauna inventories and recommendations on&#13;
mitigation for their protection prepared by biologists. Project support to update FMPs is addressed in&#13;
Appendix 7.&#13;
49.         This measure has been included in project design as a sub-component (Support fo Forest&#13;
Inspection) of the component "Support to Forest Management".&#13;
50.         Institutional arrangements: Due to the current unclear situation of the FIS in FBiH&#13;
(e.g., opinions differs among officials whether the service would continue at the Commune level or be&#13;
transferred to Canton level), the arrangements for implementation of this measure would be proposed&#13;
by the expert (technical assistance) to be contracted during a the first two months of the project.&#13;
51.         Implementation Schedule: The development of the study to propose the implementation&#13;
arrangements would be worked out in the first two months of the project. The training of inspectors&#13;
during the third and/or fourth months. In those areas where inspectors are available, FIS would start in&#13;
the first month of the project. On the other locations, after the training period (from the fifth month&#13;
on).&#13;
Impact: Harvesting of Biologically-rich Forested Areas&#13;
Proposed mitigating measure: Phasing of Project Interventions cum Biological&#13;
Resources Inventories.&#13;
52.         In order to prevent risks of reducing critical habitat and to decrease biodiversity within&#13;
certain forest tracts which, for biological significance, should not be logged but conserved, the&#13;
following measures are recommended: (i) only Sumarstov's with an approved management plan located&#13;
in non-sensitive areas be included for immediate project support; (ii) in the 10 Sumarstvos with&#13;
biologically-sensitive areas project support would be provided immediately only in the non-sensitive&#13;
portions of the Sumartsvo; in the biologically-sensitive portions project support would be preceded by&#13;
ecological surveys' the results of which should be reflected in updated management plans of the&#13;
Sumarstvo to include measures to protect endangered species/habitat (including the possible&#13;
reclassification of some or all of the area if so warranted); (iii) institutional strengthening dependent on&#13;
the specific needs of (a) the Sumarstvo in such areas as habitat protection and road repair and&#13;
improvement; (b) the government organisation responsible for updating the forest management plans;&#13;
and (c) the Institute of Natural Heritage responsible to complete the ecological survey on the proposed&#13;
protected areas.&#13;
53.         This measure has been included in project-design as a sub-component of the project&#13;
(Protected Areas Development), as part of the component "Protection and Rehabilitation of Forests".&#13;
Terms of Reference for the Ecological Survey are presented in Attachment 1. The survey would cover&#13;
six areas (8 mountains) listed in Table 1. The table below includes a list of investments required for&#13;
this mitigation measure.&#13;
The ecological surveys should be included so that provisions can be made for the establishment and&#13;
management of biologically sensitive areas within the areas controlled by the Sumarstvos.&#13;

54.         Institutional arrangements: The IPNH would have the responsibility to carry out the&#13;
ecological surveys. The institutional strengthening dependent on the specific needs of the Sumarstvos in&#13;
such areas as habitat protection and road repair and improvement would be provided by the training of&#13;
workers. This training would be given by the experts responsible by the ecological survey (the cost of&#13;
this training is included in the ecological survey). The strengthening of the IPNH (basically field&#13;
equipment) was included in the proposal for the ecological surveys.&#13;
55.         Implementation Schedule: The development of the ecological surveys would last one&#13;
year, starting on the first month of the project and would include three months of fieldwork.&#13;
Impact: Soil erosion caused by harvesting and logging operations&#13;
Proposed mitigation measures: planning of harvesting operations and training of&#13;
Sumartvos' workers and entrepreneurs.&#13;
56.         Forest management plans developed under the project would provide that, mainly on&#13;
steep slopes, all harvesting and logging operations would be avoided (i) during and after long and/or&#13;
intensive rain and (ii) during the thawing season. The yearly harvesting plan would include provisions&#13;
to transfer harvesting and logging operations to less sensitive areas during those critical periods (areas&#13;
with better soil conditions and less steep lands). In addition, good-practices of erosion control would be&#13;
strengthened under the project by training workers of the Sumarstvos and entrepreneurs. For the&#13;
aforementioned training, twenty five short courses (two days duration for each course to be conducted&#13;
each year) are included in the project.&#13;
57.         Specific requirements: Twenty five short courses per year to train Sumarstvos' workers&#13;
and entrepreneurs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 6&#13;
Page 17 of 25&#13;
58.         Institutional arrangements: The training would be under the responsibility of BH Sume.&#13;
The responsibility to carry out the yearly harvesting plan according to FPMs would be under the&#13;
Sumarstvos.&#13;
59.         Implementation Schedule: The courses would be conducted in PYI. The implementation&#13;
of improved soil erosion practices would start during the first wet period (rain period at the end of the&#13;
autumn or during the melting of snow in March/April), preferably before the preparation of the early&#13;
harvesting plan.&#13;
Impact: Loss of slope stability from harvesting activities&#13;
Proposed mitigation measures: the same as above (soil erosion) and, in addition, (i) the&#13;
use of horses in very steep slopes where landslides are likely to occur1/; and (ii) training to avoid&#13;
contruction of skidding trails in high risk areas.&#13;
60.         The planning of skidding trails to avoid high risk areas would be supported under the&#13;
project by the training of the Sumarstvos' directors, field workers of the Sumarstvos and entrepreneurs.&#13;
No clearfelling would be allowed in those risk areas. Harvesting and logging operations would be&#13;
avoided during wet periods (rainy days and thaw). Horses should be used in very steep slopes. Training&#13;
would be included in the project through workshops on erosion control.&#13;
61.         Institutional arrangements: The responsibility to carry out the measures would be under&#13;
the Sumarstvos. The training should be provided by BH Sume.&#13;
62.         Implementation Schedule: The implementation would start during the first wet period&#13;
(rain period at the end of the autumn or during the melting of snow in March/April), preferably before&#13;
the preparation of the early harvesting plan. The training workshops should be conducted each year.&#13;
Road Rehabilitation Aspects&#13;
63.         Required mitigating measure: As explained in Chapter E, review of existing forest road&#13;
construction and rehabilitation requirements, together with spot field surveys, would indicate that no&#13;
further mitigation measure were required. Nevertheless, although no mitigation measures are required&#13;
for the moment, monitoring of the possible erosion problems on road repair to be supported under the&#13;
project is included in the Environmental Monitoring Plan (see Chapter G below).&#13;
Non Compliance of Mitigation Measures&#13;
64.         An environmental monitoring plan is is presented in Chapter G. The purpose of the plan&#13;
is to evaluate whether project activities are in compliance with project design and that mitigation&#13;
The use of horses has become common since the war. In addition to favourable enviromnental impact, the&#13;
use of horses increases the employment effect of harvesting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

measures are achieving their desired effect. In case project activities are not in compliance with project&#13;
design and with mitigation measures, relevant information would be reported to the Project&#13;
Implementation Unit (PIU).&#13;
G. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PLAN&#13;
Objective and Type of Monitoring&#13;
65.         The project will support the preparation and execution of an environmental monitoring&#13;
plan. The objective of the plan is to monitor the environmental impacts of the project and evaluate&#13;
whether project activities are in compliance with project design and that mitigation measures are&#13;
achieving their desired effects.&#13;
66.         Monitoring will include data collecting on physical aspects (soil contamination, soil&#13;
erosion and sediment transport into rivers, etc.) and biodiversity parameters (wildlife, biodevirsity&#13;
inventories, forest protection, etc.). The following paragraphs present the proposed: (i) monitoring&#13;
stations, (ii) monitoring frequency, (iii) checklist of potential environmental impacts and respective&#13;
environmental indicators, (iv) institution responsible to execute the monitoring plan, and (v) monitoring&#13;
costs.&#13;
Monitoring Stations&#13;
67.         Environmental monitoring  stations are proposed  for the  30  forest enterprises&#13;
(Sumarstvos) to be supported under the project1'. Within each Sumarstvo, the monitoring would cover&#13;
only the areas to be harvested with equipment provided by the project during the life of the project.&#13;
These portions would be monitored before and after harvesting and logging activities.&#13;
Frequency and Duration of Monitoring&#13;
The monitoring of each Sumarstvo would occur through a total of 100 site visits&#13;
conducted in 12 fieldtrips scheduled over the 2 year life of the project. Each Sumarstvo would be&#13;
visited four times (i.e., bi-annually). The fieldtrips would be divided into three regions of the&#13;
Federation: Central Bosnia, Herzcegovina and Western Bosnia. Each fieldtrip would cover&#13;
approximately eight Sumarstvos. The table below presents the schedule for the fieldtrips.&#13;
Except for the monitoring of possible project-supported harvesting of biologically-rich forest areas. The&#13;
monitoring would be focused in the six areas/mountains identified as biologically sensitive forest&#13;
habitats (see Table 1 and Map 1).&#13;

Environmental Impacts to be Monitored&#13;
Harvesting in Biologically Sensitive Areas&#13;
69.         Areas to be monitored"': portions of mountains Vlasic, Tajan, Zvijezda, Sator, Vranica,&#13;
Prenj, Cvrsnica and Cabulja.&#13;
Checklist&#13;
70.         Are there harvesting activities in the aforementioned areas before the end of the&#13;
ecological survey?&#13;
71.         Are there harvesting activities in the aforementioned areas after the end of the ecological&#13;
survey? Have adequate measures (limited amount of harvesting, etc.) been taken to keep compatibility&#13;
with forest protection?&#13;
Indicators&#13;
72.         Change in natural land vegetation in the portions of Sumarstvos provided with&#13;
biologically sensitive areas (portions of mountains Vlasic, Tajan, Zvijezda, Sator, Vranica, Prenj,&#13;
Cvrsnica and Cabulja)&#13;
73.         Substantial reduction or disappearance of listed species in the aforementioned&#13;
biologically sensitive areas after harvesting.&#13;
"  Those are the same mountains which would be included in the ecological surveys.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 6&#13;
Page 20 of 25&#13;
74.         Definition of listed species (including those categorised as threatened and endangered)&#13;
include all forms of plant and animal life whose rates of reproduction have declined to the point where their&#13;
populations are so small they are in danger of disappearing or may soon decrease to this level. In the case of&#13;
Bil, a list of endangered and threatened species for both fauna (mainly birds) and flora is being worked out&#13;
(see Chapter B) and should be used as a reference in the measurement of this attribute.&#13;
75.         Soil erosion caused by log transport operations on skidding trails and by clearing sites and&#13;
harvesting: the magnitude of the impact will depend mainly on the type of soil and on slopes, as well as on&#13;
limitation of site preparation and harvesting to (i) non-rainy days and (ii) just after the thawing season.&#13;
Checklist&#13;
76.         Are harvesting and logging activities being performed during rainy days (or just after rain) or&#13;
just after melting of snow?&#13;
77.         What is the extent of erosion compared with the situation before harvesting?&#13;
78.         Is there any significant degradation of downstream water quality and sedimentation of&#13;
natural drainage ways caused by the harvesting operation and transport on skidding trails?&#13;
Indicators&#13;
79-Percent change in total soil loss; and (ii) photographic documentation on soil erosion and on sediment&#13;
transport to rivers downstream from the harvesting activity.&#13;
80.         Variables to be measured: the overall magnitude of the impact can be represented by the&#13;
percent change in total soil loss, with calculations based upon traditional models that represent&#13;
interrelationship among the major variables affecting erosion (such as degree of slope; soil texture or&#13;
composition; nature and extent of vegetative cover; and intensity and frequency of exposure to eroding&#13;
forces).&#13;
Loss of slope stability from timber harvesting activities on steep lands and the associated&#13;
difficulty of re-establishing forest cover on these slopes. The roadcuts across sloping terrain and clearing of&#13;
vegetation on the slopes promoting landslides.&#13;
Checklist&#13;
81.         Does the Sumarstvo's operational planning include: (i) skidding trails which avoid high risk&#13;
areas? (i.e., in very steep slopoes where lansslides are likely to occur) and (ii) transfering harvesting and&#13;
logging operations to less sensitive areas during wet periods?&#13;
82.         Are horses being used in high risk areas during logging operations?&#13;
Indicators&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 6&#13;
Page 21 of 25&#13;
83.Same as above for measuring soil erosion; and (ii) relation between the lenght and steepness of slope:&#13;
water erosion increases with the lenght and steepness of slope. A general rule which can be applied is that if&#13;
the lenght of slope is doubled, soil loss from erosion will increase by a factor of 1.5. The relationship&#13;
between degree of slope (gradient) and erosion potential can be specified in general terms as follows:&#13;
1O percent &gt; highly erodible&#13;
10 pecent = moderately erodible&#13;
2 percent &lt; slightly erorible&#13;
84.         The slope stability and erosion hazard depends upon the intensity and frequency of rain and&#13;
wind storms. Also, the difference in types of vegetative cover and the extent of each affect erosion potential.&#13;
Erosion caused by road repair operations&#13;
Checklist&#13;
85.         Are there erosion problems being caused by (i) road repair operations?; (ii) by repair in the&#13;
rainy days or just after thaw?; or any other improper repair methods which leave soils exposed&#13;
unnecessarily?&#13;
86.         Is there any significant degradation of downstream water quality and sedimentation of&#13;
natural drainage ways caused by the aforementioned operations?&#13;
Indicators&#13;
87.         Same as above for measuring soil erosion and loss of slope stability.&#13;
Qualifications&#13;
88.         Proposed specialist to participate in the environmental monitoring:&#13;
Professionals: one protection forester/botanist and one ecologist&#13;
(geographer/zoologist), with at least 3 years of experience;&#13;
Technician: one technician with experience in fieldwork involved in the monitoring;&#13;

Ecological Survey - Terms of Reference&#13;
General Objective&#13;
1.    To cariy out ecological surveys in 10 Sumarstvos which may be partly located in six&#13;
biologically-sensitive areas of the country (proposed protected areas), in order to provide&#13;
recommendations to be included in the annual harvesting plans and updated forest management&#13;
plans, which would reduce risks to critical habitats and biodiversity.&#13;
Specific Objectives and Outputs&#13;

Technical Assistance Needs for the Strengthening of the Forest Inspection Service&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
Objective&#13;
1.     To develop proposal for strengthening the organisational system of the BiH Forest&#13;
Inspection Service (FIS) which are compatible with: (i) the new emerging organization set-up under&#13;
the project in which the private sector will be responsible for harvesting and logging activities in&#13;
areas controlled by the state owned enterprises; and (ii) the emerging political situation which&#13;
include the creation of regional governments (cantons).&#13;
Background&#13;
2.     Before the war, control responsibilities were carried out by local governments (commune&#13;
level) and monitored by the national government (Republic level). Recently (post war), 10 regional&#13;
governments (canton level) have been created in the FBiH. Within the new cantonal structure&#13;
representative ministries of agriculture and forestry have also been created and the present policy is&#13;
to create a FIS in each canton.&#13;
Specific Tasks&#13;
3.     Review both pre-war and current forest inspection practices in Bosnia and Herzegovina;&#13;
4.     Review the existing forest inspection procedures for both private and state-owned forest&#13;
enterprises - at local and federal level -, with emphasis on the following aspects:&#13;
checking of marked and felled trees to ensure compliance with Forest Management Plans&#13;
(FMPs);&#13;
control of log transport;&#13;
control of the use of wood (e.g., whether a high quality wood is being used for fuelwood);&#13;
control of administrative documents of the Sumarstvos on wood selling operations;&#13;
control of tax payment;&#13;
enforcement of Article 32 of the Forest Law" on the deposit of 10% of receipts from&#13;
growth sales for replanting (forest reproduction) purposes;&#13;
Article 32 states that "forest owners are obliged to pay and amount of 10% of the value of net&#13;
cut trees in the current year onto the municipality/commune account (pay it at market&#13;
prices). The funds paid upon this regulation are used for forest reproduction. For each&#13;
cubic meter of gross logs in the previous year, at least 14 rn2 of new trees must be&#13;
planted. "&#13;

Forestry Project&#13;
Forest Management Plans&#13;
A. Summary&#13;
1.    Forest Management Plans (Sumskoprivredna Osnova) are compiled and approved for a period&#13;
of at least 10 years and not longer than 20 years. The contents of the plans and mode of compilation&#13;
are regulated by law and regulations approved by the Government. Plans are made for all state owned&#13;
forests, one plan for each Forest Management Area. The responsibility for compiling these plans rests&#13;
with the state enterprise (Sumaria or Sumarstvo) responsible for managing respective Management&#13;
Area(s). Before a plan expires a new plan has to be compiled and approved.&#13;
2.    The approved Forest Management Plans (FMPs) have to be realized during the plan period and&#13;
the established allowable cut in m3 is not allowed to be exceeded. Certain restrictions are valid for the&#13;
distribution of the allowable cut per year and, geographically over the Management area as well on the&#13;
communes comprising the area.&#13;
3.    The FMPs include:&#13;
-     Detailed description of the forest condition;&#13;
-     Analysis of the result of the previous plan period;&#13;
-     Plans for harvesting, regeneration, road construction, protective measures, hunting and&#13;
water resources;&#13;
-     Investment plans (e.g. for equipment and construction); and&#13;
-     Calculations of operating costs.&#13;
4.    The FMPs have to be approved by the central Government as well as by respective local&#13;
communes.&#13;
5.    The description of the forest management planning system in this document refers to the&#13;
Forestry Law of 1978. A new law is drafted, but will probably not be approved by the Government&#13;
until next year. Meanwhile the new law will be effective. It is reported that the new law probably will&#13;
be less detailed regarding methodology and layout. However, it is not anticipated that the new law will&#13;
differ, what concerns the philosophy and principles regulating the Management Plans, in any major&#13;
way.&#13;
6.    FMPs are also prepared for private forests, which comprise 19 percent of the total forestry&#13;
area. These plans are prepared for each commune using the individual holding, or part of it as the&#13;
management unit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 7&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
B. Laws and Regulations&#13;
7.    The Forestry Law (Zakon o Sumana), which was approved in 1978, states that all forestry&#13;
holdings are to be managed according to approved FMPs. A FMP is defined as a long term plan&#13;
which ensures that the general interest of the state and its citizens is guaranteed in line with established&#13;
forest policies and practices. The Forest Law is briefly described in Attachment 1 to this document.&#13;
8.    Based on the Forestry Law, Instructions for the contents and compilation of the FMP have&#13;
been worked out. These Instructions (Upustvo Sumsko Privredne Osnove) are approved by the&#13;
Government. Detailed Instructions for the compilation process of the plans are applied.&#13;
C. Authorization for Compilation&#13;
9.    The Sumarstvos/Sumarias appoints a firm or institution to work out its FMP. It is regulated by&#13;
law that these firms have to comprise at least five Graduate Foresters (Forestry Engineers) of which&#13;
one has to be a Magister. The firm has to be approved and registered. During the eighties FMPs were&#13;
worked out by D.P.SILVA (formerly under SIPAD Holding), the Biro za Projektovanje u Sumarstvo&#13;
in Banja Luka, Travnik Sebesic, the Faculty of Forestry, I.P. Krivaja and Stupcenica Olovo.&#13;
D. Approval&#13;
10.   The approval of the FMPs is a process involving the forestry authorities at the central level, as&#13;
well as the local communes. When a plan has been compiled it goes to MAWRAF for comments.&#13;
MAWRAF distributes the plans to involved communes for approval. The plan then goes to the&#13;
Government for final approval. This means that other ministries have the right to comment upon the&#13;
plan before approval. The field work is controlled by a central commission as well as by respective&#13;
Sumarstvo/Sumaria.&#13;
E. Contents&#13;
11.   According to Government Instructions the FMP plan should contain, but riot be restricted to,&#13;
the following issues:&#13;
-     Forest conditions according to established forest classification system;&#13;
-     Forest areas should be classified according to its forest type in Forest Classes&#13;
(Kategorije Suma) and according to planned treatment in Treatment Classes&#13;
(Gospodarska Klasa);&#13;
-     Classification of trees according to species, diameter class and quality;&#13;
-     Presentation of growing stock, yield and diameter distribution; and&#13;
-     Proposed treatment harvesting, regeneration as well as other activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 7&#13;
Page 3 of 8&#13;
This information is presented per Treatment Class, Management Unit (Gospadarska Jedinica) and&#13;
aggregated for the Management Area (Sumarstvo/Sumaria) and commune.&#13;
12.   The plan shall include: an analysis of how the forest situation developed during the previous&#13;
plan period; and a comparison with the new plan. This analysis is done on Sumarstvo/Sumaria level&#13;
only.&#13;
13.   The following specific plans shall be included in the FMP:&#13;
-     Harvesting;&#13;
-     Afforestation and reforestation;&#13;
-     Forest protection;&#13;
-     Extraction volumes specified per assortment;&#13;
-     Road construction;&#13;
-     Water resources, and&#13;
-     Hunting.&#13;
In addition the FMP shall include a financial and economic analysis of the plan period as well as an&#13;
investment plan. The contents of the FMPs are detailed in Attachment 2 to this document&#13;
14.   Maps of various types constitute an important part of the FMP. The following maps are&#13;
worked out:&#13;
Management Area, its location, etc., on a topographical map with scale 1:50 000;&#13;
Management units in scale 1:25 000; and&#13;
Treatment units in scale 1;10 000.&#13;
F. Compilation Process&#13;
15.   The plan is worked out in two steps.&#13;
(i)    data collection in the field; and&#13;
(ii)    analysis of field data and compilation of the plan itself.&#13;
16.   The Forest Management Area (Sumsko Privredno Podrvoje =  SPP) is divided into&#13;
Management units (Gospodorska Jedinica). Management units are then divided into compartments&#13;
(odjel, pl.odjeli). Natural borders are sought for these units. The boundaries of the compartments are&#13;
fixed and not allowed to be changed.&#13;
17.   The compartments are divided into stands (odjek, pl.odjeci) based on treatment class&#13;
(Gazdinska Klasa). The geographical boundaries of these units are shown on maps using scale 1:50 000&#13;
for the whole management area, 1:25 000 for management units and 1:10 000 for compartments and&#13;
stands. The last map indicates the number for compartments (1, 2, 3...) and stands (a,b,c....). The&#13;
treatment class is indicated for each stand (01,02,03....).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 7&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
18.   The demarcation lines for Management area, Management units, compartments and stands are&#13;
marked with paint on standing trees. The number of the respective compartment and letter of the&#13;
respective stand are painted on the same tree. These markings are painted in a regulated and uniform&#13;
way and are not allowed to be removed.&#13;
19.   All basic forestry field data is collected and registered per defined stand (odjek) through a grid&#13;
of sample plots (lOOxlOO meters). The model for collection of field data is further described in&#13;
Attachment 4 to this document.&#13;
20.   An experimental selection of trees to be removed is conducted for every second sample plot.&#13;
Trees to be harvested are selected in order to get a stand as similar as possible to a predetermined&#13;
norm or standard. Trees are selected in all diameter classes but damaged or sick trees and trees with&#13;
DBH (diameter at breast height) more than 80 cm are always selected first. The selection is performed&#13;
according to approved silvicultural practices in a way that the specific norm for the respective TC can&#13;
be reached. See further under "Treatment Classification" and "Silvicultural Systems" below.&#13;
G. Treatment Classification&#13;
21.   As mentioned above, every stand is classified per Treatment Class (TC). The TC constitutes&#13;
the basic stratum for which all data is registered and summed up, and for which all calculations are&#13;
made e.g. allowable cut.&#13;
22.   A TC is defined as a group of stands with similar ecological and production features for which&#13;
the same treatment is planned (planned to be managed in the same way).&#13;
23.   The TC classification is based on the forest classification system with its main and sub groups&#13;
in such a way that every forest class may have one or more TC, but one specific TC can only be&#13;
attributed to one specific forest class. The TC is defined for each Management Area and can therefore&#13;
differ between Sumarstvos/Sumarias. The number of TCs can vary substantially (normal range 20 -&#13;
40). The Forest Classification System is presented in Attachment 3 to this document.&#13;
24.   A Norm or standard for each TC is defined, constituting its final silviculture goal. The&#13;
principle is to reach this standard through active treatment activities (cutting, cleaning, planting, etc.)&#13;
for a defined period of time. The standard is expressed in e.g. m3/ha and mix of species.&#13;
H. Analysis and Documentation&#13;
25.   All data is registered in a computer and processed. Analysis of the data is performed manually.&#13;
Desk top editing is not used when compiling the document.&#13;
26.   The analysis of the development of the forestry situation and comparisons with the previous&#13;
plan are done on a Management Area level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 7&#13;
Page 5 of 8&#13;
I. Allowable Cut&#13;
27.   The Allowable Cut is calculated for each TC during the plan period, normally 10 years. In the&#13;
FMP the allowable cutting volumes are summarized and presented for:&#13;
treatment class;&#13;
management unit; and&#13;
commune.&#13;
28.   The AC is calculated in different ways depending on the specific conditions of each TC. For&#13;
TCs defined as "High Quality" High Forests, the volume of selected trees (V,) is calculated and&#13;
compared with the yield (Y) for the same TC. The AC is then calculated as&#13;
AC= (V1 + Y)/2.&#13;
29.   When the present volume of a TC (V,) differs substantially from the standard volume (V2), and&#13;
it is judged that the volume could not be reached within the plan period, the AC is calculated as&#13;
follows:&#13;
AC= Y + (V,- V2)/S&#13;
where S is the number of plan periods during which the standard volume is planned be reached,&#13;
normally 2 or 3 periods.&#13;
30.   In TCs where clearfelling is proposed, the total harvesting volume is based on how large an&#13;
area it would be possible to reforest during the plan period. (An economic constraint.) See further&#13;
under regeneration rules below.&#13;
31.   The AC for the different TCs is then added and constitutes the total allowable cut for the plan&#13;
period.&#13;
32.   According to the Forest Law, the AC is not allowed to be exceeded for forests belonging to the&#13;
Forest Class "High Forest" during the plan period.&#13;
33.   The Annual Allowable Cut (AAC) is defined as the total allowable cut for the plan period&#13;
divided by the number of years for the same period. The allowable cut for the plan period should be&#13;
divided per year as even as possible over the plan period. The annual cut should be divided by&#13;
communes and management units within each Management Area as even as feasible.&#13;
34.   The Allowable Cut and the AAC can be exceeded for clear felling of degraded forests for&#13;
reforestation.&#13;
J. Silviculture Systems&#13;
35.   When preparing and executing the FMP, approved silvicultural policies and accepted practices&#13;
shall be followed. The following four systems are guiding principles for the management of the forests:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 7&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
(1)    Selective cutting, implying removal of dead, damaged and dead trees. Oversized trees&#13;
(more than 80 cm in breast height) should also be cut.&#13;
(2)    Combination of selective cutting and group selection cutting. Clearfelling of small&#13;
areas (0.3-0.5 ha) could also be done.&#13;
(3)    Group selection cutting in pure stands of either conifers or broadleaves in combination&#13;
with clearfelling of areas up to 2.0 ha.&#13;
(4)    Clearfelling of degraded high forests and coppice forests for planting of areas up to 20&#13;
ha mainly with conifers, as well as planting of productive bare land.&#13;
K Regeneration Rules&#13;
36.   As a basic principle, the law states that, all clear felled areas have to be reforested. This is&#13;
planned for in the FMPs. Depending on the TC to be regenerated different rules are applicable.&#13;
37.   According to the Forest Law an area of 14 m2 has to be planted for each gross m3 harvested.&#13;
This type of regeneration is called "Simple regeneration". This is a forcing rule and the planting as&#13;
such is financed by a special fund for each respective Sumarstvo/ Sumaria. All clear felled areas could&#13;
be planted using this fund. Plantation of bare land could, if all clear felled areas are planted first, be&#13;
planted using the same fund.&#13;
38.   It is allowed and also promoted to convert degraded high forests, coppice forests as well as&#13;
productive bare land to productive plantation forests (kultura). This type of regeneration could be&#13;
funded by contributions based on so called "Social agreements" from the State, the communes and the&#13;
industry. This fund should give priority to the afforestation of bare lands. The present "Agreement" is&#13;
in principle valid until 2000, but only the State and the Sumarstvos/Sumarias have sofar fulfilled their&#13;
part of the "Agreement". This type of regeneration is called "Extended regeneration," it is voluntary&#13;
and totally depending on funds made available.&#13;
39.   The Sumarstvos/Sumarias can clear fell areas for planting exceeding what could be financed by&#13;
the " 14 rn2 rule" or the "Agreement" if own funds could be generated for this purpose. However, very&#13;
few new plantations have been established with such funding.&#13;
L. Annual Planning&#13;
40.   Based on the FMP, an Annual Plan has to be worked out. This plan is compiled by respective&#13;
Sumarstvo/Sumaria. The Annual Plan has to be approved by the local communes.&#13;
41.   The Annual Plan is an operational plan where all activities for the following year are planned,&#13;
extracted assortments and their sale value calculated, and costs for all activities budgeted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

M. BH Sume and its Planning Department&#13;
Present Situation&#13;
42.   BH Sume (Bosanskoherzegoacke Sume) is a state owned company organized to manage all state&#13;
owned forests and forest land within the Federation. BH Sume is organized under MAWRAF. The&#13;
company is only rudimentary manned and its status and relations with the cantons and the&#13;
Sumarstvos/Sumarias is not yet defined. A new law regulating the state owned companies is under&#13;
preparation.&#13;
43.   The Planning Department of BH Sume was formerly an independent enterprise under SIPAD&#13;
Holding called " SILVA". The department is at present just an embryo of what it strives to be, with&#13;
only three forest engineers employed. The plan is to employ a total of 25 persons, mainly forest&#13;
engineers. These persons are at present waiting to be employed, as soon as funds become available.&#13;
The duties of the department will comprise various types of forestry planning such as forest&#13;
management planning and forestry road planning. SILVA was the biggest provider of FMPs in the&#13;
Republic before the war. Its capacity amounted to the compilation of six FMPs per year.&#13;
44.   All types of forest inventory equipment and equipment for e.g. road planning were destroyed&#13;
or disappeared during the war. A total refumishing of this type of equipment is necessary before the&#13;
department can resume its work. The presence of equipment is also a precondition for the employment&#13;
of the personnel mentioned above.&#13;
45.   Of the 25 Sumarstvos/Sumarias proposed to participate in the project only 11 have FMPs&#13;
which are valid after 1998. A revision of some valid plans may also be necessary due to the impact of&#13;
the war. The accumulated number of expired plans, plans which will expire by the end of 1998, plus&#13;
plans which have to be revised due to the war situation, may amount to as much as 25 of the total 45&#13;
FMPs for the whole Federation. A quick restart of the compilation of the FMPs must therefore be&#13;
judged as an emergency activity for management of the forests.&#13;
Proposal for Support&#13;
46.   It is proposed to support BH Sume and its Planning Department with equipment, short term&#13;
consultancies and training of personnel. The individual components are described below:&#13;
(i)    Field inventory equipment;&#13;
(ii)   Equipment for processing of field data such as computers and printers;&#13;
(iii)   Equipment for printing and copying of maps;&#13;
(iv)   Five "four wheel drive" vehicles for field inventory teams;&#13;
(v)    One "four wheel drive vehicle" placed centrally at BH Sume for supervision and&#13;
control of field activities;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

The Forest Law of 1978&#13;
1.          The present Forest Law was approved by the Parliament of the Republic in November&#13;
1978 and is still valid. A new law is drafted but will probably not be effective during 1996.&#13;
2.           The first article expresses that protection and management of the forest is a general&#13;
interest to the people of the Republic. Enterprises managing the forests, forest owners, communes and&#13;
the state itself shall be engaged in the protection and management of the forests.&#13;
3.           Forest is defined as land on which forests are growing. Forest land is land which does&#13;
not carry any trees within the boundaries of Forest Management Areas, and which because of its&#13;
natural and economic conditions should be converted to forests. Land in urban areas suitable for forest&#13;
production is also defined as forest land.&#13;
4.           Forests established by wood processing enterprises from their own funds are not, in the&#13;
sense of this law, considered as forest. The same applies to isolated groups of trees smaller 500 ni2.&#13;
5.           Forests shall be managed in a sustainable way so that its value is preserved and an even&#13;
income over the years is generated. The law states specifically that importance of secondary products&#13;
such as forest seeds, fruits, medicinal herbs, mushrooms, stones etc. and the use of forests for tourism,&#13;
hunting and recreation.&#13;
6.           For the management of State forests, Forest Management Areas (FMAs) are formed.&#13;
One enterprise should be established to manage the area belonging to one FMA.&#13;
7.           Private forests and forests belonging to communes are managed by their owners. Forest&#13;
enterprises can through agreements with private owners and communes, take over the responsibility of&#13;
managing these forests.&#13;
8.           Protective forests are defined as forests where the prime interest is not forest production&#13;
but the protection of soil, water resources, etc., from natural disasters. To this category of forests are&#13;
included forests with special interest, such as areas with rare plants and trees, areas of specific&#13;
scientific interest and areas of cultural or historical interest (National Parks, reserves etc). The&#13;
Parliament proclaims areas to be protected.&#13;
9.           The law states that Forest Management Plans are mandatory for all forests. The forest&#13;
enterprises are responsible for ensuring that FMPs are prepared for their respective areas. The&#13;
communes are responsible for ensuring that FMPs are prepared for their own forests and for private&#13;
forests within the commune.&#13;
10.         Forest enterprises, communes and private owners are obliged to pay tax for financing&#13;
forest regeneration. This tax is used for regeneration, road construction and technical documentation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 7&#13;
Attachment 1&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
The tax is based on the gross value of sold assortments loaded on trucks and amounts, normally, to at&#13;
least 10%. The tax is paid to a separate account for each forest enterprise.&#13;
11.         Private forest owners pay a corresponding tax to a common communal account of 10%&#13;
based on the net value of felled trees.&#13;
12.         The taxes paid into the accounts described above should be used for regeneration. At&#13;
least 14 m2 shall be planted for each m3 gross volume harvested. If the duties regarding planting are&#13;
not fulfilled within two years the local commune may arrange for the planting on the account of&#13;
respective enterprise or forest owner.&#13;
13.         The law forbids harvesting rare trees and damaging growing trees during harvesting&#13;
operations.&#13;
14.         Grazing, browsing, lopping and collection of dried leaves and mosses is forbidden on&#13;
State forest land if not stated otherwise in the FMP.&#13;
15.         Forest enterprises and private forest owners are obliged to guard and control the forest&#13;
in relation to fires, insect attacks, winds, snow and other natural disasters.&#13;
16.         The forests shall be guarded and protected by special Forest Guards employed by the&#13;
Forest Enterprises or the communes. The law prescribes the duties of the Forest Guards and what&#13;
legal action they are allowed to undertake.&#13;
17.         A special cadastral register shall be maintained of all forest land. The Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture, Water Resources and Forestry is responsible for this register.&#13;
18.         A special Forest Inspectorate on Republic and commune level shall monitor that the rules&#13;
of the Forest Law are followed. The law lists specifically what the forest inspectors are authorized to&#13;
do.&#13;

Forest Classification System in RBiH&#13;
According to regulations under the forest law", the forests and forest lands are divided into six&#13;
categories:&#13;
(i)    High forest with natural regeneration, which are considered by the forestry&#13;
institutions as high quality production forests and are divided into four sub-&#13;
categories:&#13;
* beech forests;&#13;
* mixced forests: fir and spruce; or beech, fir and spruce;&#13;
* white and black pine forests; and&#13;
* oak forests.&#13;
(ii)   Degraded high forests, where there is no possibility for natural regeneration due to&#13;
the following reasons: low wood stock; soil erosion; and/or presence of bushes&#13;
which do not allow young trees to grow. This type of forest is divided into two sub-&#13;
categories:&#13;
* degraded beech high forests; and&#13;
* degraded oak high forests.&#13;
(iii)  Even aged forests (plantations), divided into three sub-categories:&#13;
* mixed forests with spruce and fir&#13;
* white and black pine forests; and&#13;
* mixed conifers.&#13;
(iv)   Sprout forests (growing from stump), divided into four sub-categories:&#13;
* beech forests;&#13;
* oak forests;&#13;
* mixed broadleaves; and&#13;
* other broadleaves.&#13;
(v)     Productive barelands, which are considered by the forestry institutions as&#13;
barelands that stand below the limits of production forests and could be&#13;
transformed into production forests. They are divided into two sub-categories:&#13;
Forest Law for the RBiH issued in 1978.&#13;

Field Data Collection&#13;
1.         The Forest Management Area is divided into Management units. Natural borders are sought&#13;
for these units. Management units are divided into compartments (odjel) based on forest type (kategorije&#13;
suma). The compartments are divided into stands (odjek) based on treatment class (gazdinska klasa). The&#13;
geographical boundaries of these units are shown on maps using scale 1:50 000 for the whole management&#13;
area, 1:25 000 for management units and 1:10 000 for compartments and stands. The last map indicates&#13;
number for compartments (1, 2, 3...) and letters for stands (a,b,c....). Treatment class is also indicated for&#13;
each stand (01,02,03 ...... ).&#13;
2.         All basic forestry field data is collected and registered per defined stand (odjek) through a&#13;
grid of sample plots (lOOxlOO meters). Every second plot is called a "simple plot" and every other is&#13;
called a "detailed plot." Every stand is given a treatment class.&#13;
3.         Every sample plot consists of a number of concentric circles and the trees are registered as&#13;
follows:&#13;
Radius                    Diameter class&#13;
1.5 m                    young trees lower than 1.3 m and trees with DBH lower&#13;
than 5 cm&#13;
2.5 m                     5- 10cm&#13;
4.5m                     11-20cm&#13;
5.5 m                    21-30 cm&#13;
9.0m                     31-50 cm&#13;
15.0 m                   51-80 cm&#13;
25.0 m                    81+  cm&#13;
4.         Simple plots diameter and species of trees greater than 5 cm are registered per 5 cm diameter&#13;
class.&#13;
5.         For detailed plots, in addition to what is registered for simple plots, the following data is&#13;
registered:&#13;
Young trees with diameters under 5 cm and below breast height;&#13;
Height of trees in m;&#13;
Width of the 10 last annual rings in mm x 2 ( increment borer used);&#13;
Test marking for felling;&#13;

Forestry Project&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.    Although the current project was initially designed as an emergency operation M&amp;E aspects&#13;
have been emphasized for the following three major reasons. Firstly, the project is dealing, though&#13;
indirectly, with forestry harvesting which is an environmentally sensitive activity; secondly, the sector&#13;
has had a tradition of control and monitoring which needs to be revived in line with productive&#13;
capacity; and finally, with a number of projects under way and more in the pipeline, Bosnia needs to&#13;
start developing experience and expertise in modem methods of M&amp;E. Nevertheless, the proposed&#13;
M&amp;E activities are simplified and are limited to a few key variables.&#13;
B. The Monitoring and Evaluation Programme&#13;
2.    The project would undertake regular monitoring of:&#13;
project funded inputs (physical and financial data on project support);&#13;
project activities (the use of project funded inputs); and&#13;
-     project output (direct benefits arising out of project support).&#13;
3.    The project would also undertake two evaluation studies to assess the wider impact of the&#13;
project on production, income and employment.&#13;
Monitoring of Project Funded Inputs&#13;
4.    Physical Inputs: The data on equipment procured would specify the type and number of&#13;
equipment, their make, time and place of delivery and an assessment of problems faced in procurement&#13;
and delivery. In the case of consultant recruitment, information would be provided on their speciality&#13;
and qualifications, the timing and duration of their assignments, submission of reports, and an&#13;
assessment of their performance. Since all procurement and consultant recruitment would be&#13;
undertaken by the Project Implementation Units (PIUs), the PIUs should be responsible for monitoring&#13;
and reporting on these aspects. In the case of staff, mostly field level staff would be recruited. The&#13;
PIUs would be responsible for reporting on the numbers of staff recruited, including staff recruited by&#13;
the Forest Inspection Services.&#13;
5.    Financial Data: The PIUs would maintain adequate financial accounts showing details of all&#13;
expenditures and these accounts would be audited as per agreement with the Bank. The PIUs would&#13;
also maintain records of all disbursements under the Credit.&#13;
6.    Reporting Responsibility: The PIU would be responsible for collecting and collating all data&#13;
required. This would be compiled in the form of a quarterly progress report. This report would include&#13;
information on project activities (see below) and its preparation should coincide with the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 8&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
supervision missions. Within the PIUs, it would be the specific responsibility of the M&amp;E officer and&#13;
the financial staff to prepare the necessary information under the overall supervision of the head of the&#13;
PIU.&#13;
Monitoring of Project Funded Activities&#13;
7.    Equipment Related: Data would be provided by the PIUs on the status of equipment procured&#13;
under the project. This information would be broken down by SFEs and specify the number and type&#13;
of machinery, equipment and vehicles, and the supply &amp; credit agreements established when dealing&#13;
with road maintenance and transport equipment.&#13;
8.    Management Related: The PIU would keep track of progress in preparation of new forest&#13;
management plans (FMPs). In particular, it would monitor: remote sensing/aerial photography work&#13;
and report on areas covered, and the activities (interpretation, computerisation, change detection)&#13;
completed; and the amount of field work (ground truthing and forest surveys) completed. Information&#13;
would also be collected on the activities of the Forest Inspection Services (FISs) and the main indicator&#13;
to be monitored would be the number of inspection visits they carry out in the reporting period. The&#13;
information on inspection visits would be broken down by SFEs.&#13;
9.    Reporting Responsibility: As in the case of the input monitoring reports, the PIU, and in&#13;
particular the M&amp;E officer, would be responsible for collecting and collating all data. This information&#13;
would be included in the quarterly progress report.&#13;
Monitoring of Project Output&#13;
10.   Harvest Related: The participating SFEs would be required to provide information on quantity&#13;
of wood harvested broken down by type (fuelwood, coniferous timber, beech timber); and whether the&#13;
harvesting was undertaken by private contractors or by the SFEs themselves. Information would also&#13;
be provided on the sale of wood harvested in the SFE specifying the price and quantity sold of each&#13;
type of wood along with an indication of the buyer (trader, local saw-mill or saw-mill in another area).&#13;
The participating SFEs would also be required to provide information on direct employment provided&#13;
by them, as well as an estimate of employment provided by the private contractors working in their&#13;
area. The information on employment would be broken down by skill level (engineer, technician,&#13;
worker). This information would be collected by a questionnaire provided by the PIUs to all&#13;
participating SFEs. The questionnaire would be designed and tested by an internationally recruited&#13;
M&amp;E expert who would be funded under the project (see Attachment 1 for terms-of-reference).&#13;
11.   Management Related: The PIUs would keep track of the number of FMPs completed&#13;
satisfactorily. The work of the FIS would be monitored by requesting information on contraventions&#13;
identified and fines imposed on SFEs and private contractors.&#13;
12.   Reporting Responsibility: PLUs would be responsible for sending out questionnaires to the&#13;
SFEs and ensuring that these are completed in time duly filled in. The completed questionnaires would&#13;
be passed on the M&amp;E officer in the PIU for collation and analysis. Where major discrepancies are&#13;
identified through questionnaire responses, the M&amp;E officer would undertake field checks to undertake&#13;
an independent assessment. Based on the questionnaires and information on the FISs, the M&amp;E officer&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 8&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
would prepare a short report quantifying overall increases in production, sales and direct employment&#13;
resulting from the project and on the activities of the FISs.&#13;
Evaluation Studies&#13;
13.   While the impact indicators discussed above would provide an estimate of some of the direct&#13;
benefits of the project, more in-depth studies would be needed to assess the project's success in a wider&#13;
context. Two special studies would be supported under the project: (i) impact assessment study; and&#13;
(ii) local economy study.&#13;
14.   Income Study: This study would look at the project's impact on revenues and profits of the&#13;
direct project beneficiaries. Selected SFEs participating in the project would be interviewed and&#13;
available accounts and records examined. Based on this an assessment would be made of the increase&#13;
in their revenues and profits as a result of the project. If considered useful, some of the SFEs which&#13;
did not participate in the project should also be interviewed. In order to identify any regional variations&#13;
the study would cover 8 SFEs.&#13;
15.   Local Economy Study: This study would look at the project' s impact on the local economy in&#13;
terms of indirect employment and income generation effects. Two towns that are largely dependant on&#13;
wood harvesting and processing would be selected for the study and informal participatory interview&#13;
methods would be used.&#13;
16.   Administration of the Studies: The studies would be carried out by an appropriate local&#13;
university, research institute or NGO to be selected by the PIU. Detailed terms-of-reference for the&#13;
studies would be prepared by the international M&amp;E expert (see Attachment 1). The reports of the&#13;
studies would be submitted for comments and clearance to the PIU.&#13;
C. Cost of the M&amp;E Programme&#13;
17.   The proposed M&amp;E programme would require the services of an M&amp;E officer working in the&#13;
PIU, 12 person months of local consultancy services and 6 person month of international consultancy&#13;
services.&#13;

2.    Information on the above indicators would be provided by the SFEs, PIUs, and, in the case of&#13;
inspection activities, by the Forest Inspection Services. Specifically designed questionnaires would be&#13;
used for collecting information from the SFEs. The PIU would be responsible for collecting and&#13;
collating information and preparing regular progress reports - quarterly in the case of project inputs&#13;
and activities and bi-annually in the case of project impact.&#13;
3.    Evaluation studies. In order to assess the wider impact of the project on incomes and&#13;
employment, three in-depth studies would be done covering: incomes, the wood processing industry&#13;
and the local economy. The objectives of the study and the manpower required are shown below:&#13;

Bosnia and Herzegovina&#13;
Forestry Project&#13;
Economic and Financial Analysis&#13;
I. Economic Analysis of the Project&#13;
Benefits Expected from the Project&#13;
1.    The project would have environmental benefits and would permit increased and sustained&#13;
production of wood; these benefits are discussed below:&#13;
(a)    Technical support to analysis of policy changes would examine the implications of&#13;
institutional reforns and changes in marketing, pricing and trade, which would result in&#13;
improved management of forest resources and, eventually, in increased revenues to the&#13;
state;&#13;
(b)    The technical support to improved forest management planning would permit more&#13;
timely harvesting and maintenance of trees, improving the value of the product. Improved&#13;
land-use planning would also enhance the broader value of the forest by permitting better&#13;
multi-functional forest planning and use, categorizing forests into those with primarily&#13;
sustainable production, watershed protection, ecological or recreational purposes;&#13;
(c)    Control of insect populations over 150,000 ha of highly infested forests would abate&#13;
spreading of insect attacks over 350,000 ha of coniferous high forests and prevent a&#13;
significant destruction of the standing stock, which would in turn prevent the loss in annual&#13;
marketable production of at least 100,000 m3 of logs. Reforestation in 500 ha of land&#13;
susceptible to erosion would protect human infrastructure from the risk of landslide.&#13;
Technical and logistical support to development of the protected areas system would&#13;
improve management and landuse planning and enhance the ecological and environmental&#13;
value of these sensitive areas;&#13;
(d)    The equipment for rehabilitation of forest roads funded under the project would permit&#13;
rehabilitation of about 4,000 kms of forest roads in high forests over an estimated 10&#13;
years. This would benefit approximately 40,000 ha of high forest annually, making an&#13;
estimated additional annual amount of 400,000 m3 of marketable wood in mature stands&#13;
eventually available for harvesting. This would also lower the cost of harvesting wood by&#13;
reducing the required distance for "skidding" wood from the harvest site to the roadside.&#13;
The component also has two types of environmental benefits. First, by reducing the&#13;
skidding distance it reduces soil disturbance and erosion in areas which are harvested. It&#13;
also reduces damage to remaining stands and permits more rapid regeneration. Second, by&#13;
rehabilitating roads it permits geographically more balanced harvesting, avoiding&#13;
overharvesting at the (previously) limited accessible sites;&#13;
(e)    The provision of transport equipment would permit extraction of sanitary fellings of&#13;
about 100,000 m3 per year, increasing also the growth rate and harvest value of the&#13;
remaining healthy growing stock. The nursery equipment would permit an increase in&#13;
seedling production of about 6 million seedlings per year. The telecommunications&#13;
equipment and vehicles would improve overall forest management by permitting improved&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 9&#13;
Page 2 of 9&#13;
monitoring and earlier detection of illegal harvesting and fires. It would also help ensure&#13;
overall law enforcement and implementation of management plans.&#13;
Scope and Limitation of the analysis&#13;
2.     Most of the benefits of the project are environmental and could not be quantified and evaluated&#13;
against project costs. A contingency evaluation method would be an appropriate way of evaluating these&#13;
environmental benefits but, given the present situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, concepts such as&#13;
"willingness to pay" and "existence value" cannot be meaningfully estimated. In addition, a comprehensive&#13;
analysis of the commercial benefits derived from project support was not possible mainly because (i) the&#13;
project was prepared under an emergency approach which did not allow for a comprehensive collection of&#13;
relevant data; and (ii) recent and reliable data on prices and marketing are scarce in a post-war country.&#13;
However, a cursory economic analysis, based mostly on indicative and rough estimates, has been made for&#13;
those activities supported by the project for which commercial benefits from wood production could be&#13;
estimated.&#13;
Economic Value of Wood Production&#13;
3.     Economic Price of Wood. The economic prices of wood can be approached by the ones practiced&#13;
in the neighboring countries. Indeed, Bosnia is a net exporter of broadleaf logs and is now a net importer&#13;
of conifers, in order to meet the country's reconstruction needs; they each account for a similar proportion&#13;
of sales, and production of each will increase by a similar amount as a result of the project. Furthermore,&#13;
the likely destination of the exports and origin of the imports are the same. Therefore, to simplify the&#13;
analysis, no account has been taken of international transportation costs and average prices for logs in&#13;
neighboring European countries have been used. The projected structure of sales of the SFEs is the&#13;
following: 30% pulpwood and pit props (same price); 35% of conifer logs; 35% of broadleaf logs. The&#13;
average international prices are about US$35 per m3 of pulpwood, about US$78 per m3 of conifers and&#13;
US$119 per m3 of non coniferous sawlogs1. The weighted average is around US$79 per m32.&#13;
4.     Economic Cost of Producing Wood. The next steps in estimating the economic cost of the&#13;
standing wood are to estimate (i) the economic operating cost of harvesting and transporting the logs from&#13;
the forest to the sawmill; and (ii) the operating cost of managing the forest.&#13;
5.     The operating costs of cutting, logging and transporting the logs to the sawmill are calculated by&#13;
converting financial operating costs of these operations (estimated in financial models) into economic&#13;
values. Once again, no conversion factor has yet been estimated due to the war. However, it can be&#13;
assumed that no important distortions biase the prices of goods currently as the frontiers are largely opened&#13;
and the subsidies and taxes are largely absent. A SCF of 1 can be assumed for these goods. Regarding&#13;
labor, taxes account for about 50% of the financial cost; therefore, the economic price of labor has been&#13;
assumed to be 50% of the financial cost. The following table details the calculation of operating costs of&#13;
the three operations, in US$:&#13;
Source: Forest Products Prices 1973-1992, FAO Forestry Paper, 1995. Average 1983-1992 world export prices&#13;
for coniferous logs and non coniferous logs in temperate zone respectively.&#13;
2These prices are simnilar to local prices for conifers (US$ 80 for F category) and are higher for non-conifer logs&#13;
(about US$ 85 per m3 on average) which indicates a good export potential.&#13;

(*)    Annual capacities of equipment are assumed to average respectively&#13;
1,540, 8,000 and 10,000 m3 for one chainsaw, one skidder and one truck.&#13;
(**)   Financial Prices multiplied by conversion factors.&#13;
The average operating economic cost of harvesting one m3 of wood is therefore US$12.4.&#13;
6.     The economic cost of managing the forest is more difficult to estimate. It includes the salaries and&#13;
operating expenses of the staff in charge of management planning, controlling, marking the trees, etc.&#13;
Based on BH Sume, 2,000 employees would be needed for these purposes. The cost of one employee&#13;
would be: (i) his salary or about US$6,800 per year; (ii) expenses associated with the vehicles that are&#13;
estimated at US$1,600 per staff, and (iii) other operating expenses such as office equipment and other&#13;
consumable would be limited, say to US$1,300 per year and per staff. Therefore, the economic cost of&#13;
forest management per employee would be: 6,800 * 50% (conversion factor for labor) + 1,600 + 1,300 =&#13;
US$6,300. If the pre-war level of exploitation is recovered (i.e. 2 million m3 annually), the economic cost&#13;
per m3 would be US$ 6.3. In addition to that, the cost of replantation should be added to account for&#13;
future regeneration of the forest. By law, it is fixed at 10% of the gross value of the wood, i.e. US$ 10 per&#13;
m3 in this case. The cost per m3 of management is then US$16.3.&#13;
7.     Consequently, the economic cost of producing one m3 of wood is about 12.4 + 16.3 = US$29. The&#13;
net economic value of one m3 of wood (pulpwood, pit-props, and sawlogs) produced from Bosnian forests&#13;
is then about US$50 per m3.&#13;
Economic Viability of Selected Project Activities&#13;
8.    A cursory economic viability analysis has been made only for those project activities where&#13;
benefits could be approached -- with a reasonable level of confidence given the reliability of available data -&#13;
- in terms of increased production of wood (i.e., pulpwood, pit-props, and sawlogs) and seedlings. The&#13;
analysis deals with these benefits only and does not take into account other commercial benefits (e.g.,&#13;
fuelwood, non-wood forest products); the analysis is based on very conservative assumptions and considers&#13;
a 10-year period only -- whereas a 50-year period is normally considered for investment in forests -- since&#13;
the project is by nature a reconstruction project from which benefits are mostly expected in the short or&#13;
medium term. The activities analyzed are (i) forest protection from insect attacks; (ii) forest roads&#13;
maintenance and repair; (iii) provision of wood transport equipment; and (iv) nursery rehabilitation. The&#13;
cost of project investments in these activities is US$9 million or 45% of total project cost. The combined&#13;
ERR for these activities is 59%. Assumptions and results for each individual activity are presented below&#13;
and in Table 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 9&#13;
Page 4 of 9&#13;
9.    Forest Protection from Insect Attacks. Project investments in areas highly infested by bark&#13;
beetle populations would contain further spreading of insect attacks to about 350,000 ha of adjacent forests&#13;
and prevent the annual loss of about 100,000 m3 of coniferous logs. The assumptions made are the&#13;
following: the loss avoided is 20 % of the annual potential marketable harvest of these logs (1.4 m3/halyr)&#13;
which is 60% of the annual potential marketable harvest of coniferous wood (2.3 m3/ha/yr) which is about&#13;
90% of the AAC (2.5 m3/ha/yr) and 65% of the annual yield for coniferous wood (3.5 m3/ha/yr), this level&#13;
of avoided loss is reached progressively over 5 years. The economic value of a m3 of coniferous log is&#13;
about US$ 50/m3. The ERR derived from those assumptions is 103%.&#13;
10.   Forest Roads Maintenance and Repair. Project investments will support the rehabilitation of&#13;
4,000 km of forest roads in high forests (2,500 km in the Federation and 1,500 km in RS) over 10 years.&#13;
The assumptions made are the following: 40,000 ha of high forests would be made normally accessible&#13;
again annually; although the main effect of forest road rehabilitation will be to have a more balanced&#13;
harvesting, this would also make an additional annual amount of 400,000 m3 of marketable wood&#13;
eventually available for harvesting. The latter is an estimated 25% of the potential marketable harvest of&#13;
wood which will be made progressively available thanks to increased accessibility of forests. The potential&#13;
marketable harvest of wood (3.8 m3Ma/yr) which is 80% of the annual potential harvest of wood (4.8&#13;
m3/ha/yr) which is about 90% of the AAC (5.2 m3/ha/yr) and 70% of the annual yield from high forests&#13;
(7.3 m3/ha/yr). The average economic value of a m3 of wood estimated above is about US$ 50/m3. The&#13;
ERR derived from those assumptions is 61%.&#13;
11.   Wood Transport Equipment. By providing one truck with crane to the 12 SFEs managing&#13;
forests with the highest levels of insect attacks, the project would make it possible for these SFEs to resume&#13;
sanitary fellings, and transport and sell the logs from these fellings. Although the major benefit from such&#13;
project support is improving forest health, an immediate commercial benefit is derived from the annual&#13;
120,000 m3 of wood from sanitary fellings. The estimated economic value of that wood is about US$&#13;
10/m3, based on the assumption that the economic price of wood from sanitary felling is about half of the&#13;
economic price of healthy stands (economic value/m3 = US$ 79 x 0.5 - US$ 12.4 - US$ 16.3; see para 4 to&#13;
7). The ERR derived from those assumptions is 22%.&#13;
12.   Nursery Rehabilitation. Project support to the rehabilitation of nurseries, would make it possible&#13;
to resume reforestation in Bosnia, for both commercial and environmental purposes, with high quality&#13;
seedlings. Assuming that the economic value of the average seedling under Bosnian conditions is about&#13;
US$ 0.2, the ERR derived for this activity is 12%.&#13;

II. Financial Assessment of Project Activities&#13;
13.   A detailed financial assessment of project activities was carried out in 1996, based on the initial&#13;
design of the project that was supposed to support mainly commercial harvesting activities, including&#13;
felling, skidding, and transport of wood. This assessment, which is available in project files, aimed at&#13;
assessing the financial costs and expenditures of the proposed project commercial activities, and proposing&#13;
the terms of the credit schemes under which SFEs would acquire the equipment. The assessment also made&#13;
an analysis of the financial situation after the war of selected SFEs. Since 1996, the design of the project&#13;
has changed with a focus on supporting sustainable management of forests rather than jump-starting wood&#13;
harvesting activities. Only a brief summary of the financial assessment made in 1996 is presented below,&#13;
for the provision of wood transport equipment that is still relevant to the present revised design of the&#13;
project.&#13;
14.   Assumptions. The financial output of the equipment is the current market prices of contracting&#13;
these services (i.e., transporting the wood from the forest road side to the sawmills). Different sources of&#13;
these market prices were collected; they ranged from 15 to 30 DM for transporting (between 25 and 50&#13;
kIn). Labor was considered as a cost, valued at a net salary of 400 DM per man month, which&#13;
corresponded to the average wage for skilled workers in the Herzegovinian part of the country (it is lower&#13;
in the Bosniac part but is likely to increase while unemployment rate is decreasing).&#13;
15.   Interest Rate. A proposed interest rate of "LIBOR plus 3%" or 6.25% to the SFEs has been&#13;
agreed upon between the World Bank and the Government. This rate is close to the slightly subsidized&#13;
commercial rates for agricultural purposes applied in Western Europe. The current banking system is very&#13;
weak and charges high interest rates (between 2 and 5% per month) with very short repayment periods (a&#13;
few months). They are neither accessible nor suitable for the proposed medium term investments.&#13;
16.   Results and Proposed Repayment Schemes. The model for wood transport equipment is Table&#13;
2; it shows high financial returns which are summarized as follows: (i) financial rate of return = 110%; (ii)&#13;
investment cost = DM 300,000; (iii) annual net return before financing = DM 105,600. Considering the&#13;
delays in payment of wood currently practiced (which might average 3 months) by the sawmills to the SFEs&#13;
as well as the need for the latter to accumulate a sufficient level of cash flow before starting repaying the&#13;
credit, a grace period of 1 year was agreed upon, at the request of the SFEs, BH Sume and Srpske Sume.&#13;
However, considering the possibility of generating rapid cash income with the newly purchased commercial&#13;
equipment, this grace period has been limited to 1 year in agreement with the previously mentioned&#13;
institutions.&#13;
17.   Based on the above, the proposed repayment period for wood transport equipment (in addition to&#13;
the grace period) is 5 years which corresponds to the amortization period of this equipment. As regards&#13;
forest road repair and maintenance equipment, for which no detailed financial analysis was be made in&#13;
1996, the following terms have been agreed upon (with the above mentioned interest rate): 1 year grace&#13;
period plus an 8-year repayment period which also corresponds to the amortization period of the equipment&#13;
supported under the project (i.e., graders and wheel based front loader tractors with excavator). The&#13;
financial conditions of the credit schemes supported under the project are summarized in Table 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

APPENDIX 9&#13;

18.   Repayment Capacity. The relatively favorable credit conditions proposed to the SFEs aim also at&#13;
ensuring that the level of annual repayments is affordable: for wood transport equipment, for example,&#13;
these constant installments are about 75% ofthe annual operating net benefit generated by the activity. In&#13;
addition, over the amortization period, this activity would produce cumulated net cash flows (after&#13;
repayment of the loan) of an equivalent to 150% of what is to be repaid.&#13;

            The objective of the Forestry Project
            for Bosnia-Herzegovina is to resume sustainable management
            and protection of Bosnian forest resources in order to 1)
            ensure the sustainability of the rapid recovery of the wood
            harvesting and wood processing sectors; and 2) control the
            potential environment impact of this recovery. The project
            funds the following four components: 1) Support to Forest
            Management includes support for a) policy changes, through
            studies on the institutional aspects and fiscal and
            marketing aspects of the forestry sector; b) forest
            management planning; and c) re-establishing forest
            inspection services to resume and secure adequate
            enforcement of forestry legislation. 2) Forest Protection
            and Rehabilitation include a comprehensive insect control
            program; reforestation; and rehabilitation of the national
            park and development of new protected areas, including
            technical assistance and training. 3) Rehabilitation of the
            State Forest Enterprise's Operational Capacity, which
            provides equipment for repairing and maintaining existing
            forest roads damaged during the war; and for resuming normal
            surveillance and protection of forests, carrying out forest
            regeneration and other silvicultural works, and organizing
            and controlling sustainable forest harvesting. 4) Project
            Management and Monitoring funds incremental staff to
            implement procurement, disbursement, auditing, and reporting
            procedures as well as technical assistance.
