LETTER&#13;
from the President to the Council of Governors&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
James D. Wolfensohn, president of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and&#13;
chairman of its Board of Directors, submits to the Council of Governors on behalf of&#13;
the Board of Directors and in accordance with MIGA's bylaws, this report and audited&#13;
financial statements for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The past fiscal year has not been an easy one. From the September 11th tragedy to&#13;
the ongoing economic turmoil in Argentina, from the health crises engulfing Africa to&#13;
political upheaval in Afghanistan and the Middle East, we have not seen a period in&#13;
recent history marked by such global uncertainty. And we know from experience that&#13;
the poor will suffer disproportionately from the current state of world affairs.&#13;
     Against this backdrop, The World Bank Group institutions continue to stand as&#13;
agents that support economic growth and alleviate poverty in the developing world.&#13;
The private sector-focused arms of the Bank Group play a vital role in catalyzing&#13;
private investment, which is so critical for financing sustained economic growth over&#13;
the long-term. MIGA's mandate directly addresses this development imperative,&#13;
helping developing countries attract and enhance inflows of productive capital.&#13;
     The immediate impact of the past year's events on MIGA's guarantee program&#13;
was a reduction in coverage issued compared with the previous year's levels, as&#13;
foreign investment into developing countries has decreased. Despite this, the Agency&#13;
has produced solid results in its priority areas of supporting investment: into sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa, in particular; into the world's poorest countries, in general; between&#13;
developing countries; and in support of complex infrastructure projects. The events of&#13;
the past fiscal year have also underscored MIGA's unique role as a counter-cyclical&#13;
provider of investment insurance, by stepping in at times when other insurers are&#13;
being much more selective about the projects and countries for which they will&#13;
provide coverage, and by providing investors and lenders with the confidence they&#13;
need to make long-term commitments in developing countries.&#13;
     The technical assistance services MIGA provides have taken on increased&#13;
importance as well. As countries compete to attract FDI and work to establish and&#13;
maintain a transparent and stable investment climate, strengthening institutional&#13;
capacity is key. So, too, is the global dissemination of information about investment&#13;
climate and opportunities in emerging markets.&#13;
     Over the past 12 months, developing countries overall have seen a substantial&#13;
reduction of global financial flows. Foreign investment, however, remains a critical&#13;
component in achieving economic development and poverty reduction. Increasing&#13;
investment flows is a complex task, which involves governmental measures to&#13;
strengthen investment climates through a broad variety of actions, including focusing&#13;
on corporate governance to emphasize transparency. The World Bank Group as a&#13;
whole stands ready to support these efforts, and MIGA is well prepared to play a&#13;
unique role catalyzing investment, by publicizing investment opportunities and&#13;
helping investors mitigate risk.&#13;
     In closing, I take this opportunity to encourage MIGA's member countries to use&#13;
the 12 month extension to the General Capital Increase subscription period, which will&#13;
end on March 31, 2003, to finalize their subscriptions. The strengthened capital base&#13;
will play a vital role in enabling MIGA to enhance the important contribution it makes&#13;
to development.&#13;

MESSAGE&#13;
from the Executive Vice President&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Fiscal 2002 has been a challenging year for MIGA, and indeed for everyone in the&#13;
development community. A confluence of events, including September 11th, 2001, a&#13;
troubled world economy, and the financial crisis in Argentina, have combined to&#13;
have a significant negative impact on investor confidence and FDI flows to&#13;
developing countries. Project financing has been harder to obtain, and the combi-&#13;
nation of economic and political uncertainty has led to many projects being put on&#13;
hold. The result has been a decline in the level of worldwide investment flows into&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
     For MIGA, the turbulence in this general operating environment has led to a&#13;
decline in the volume of guarantees this fiscal year, particularly in the first half of the&#13;
year. Nevertheless, the Agency was able to support a significant number of projects,&#13;
especially in our priority areas, and we have continued to diversify our guarantees&#13;
portfolio, both by region and sector. For the year, MIGA supported 33 projects,&#13;
issuing 58 guarantees totaling $1.357 billion of coverage (including the amount&#13;
insured through the Cooperative Underwriting Program). Of these projects, 14 were&#13;
in IDA-eligible countries, which now represent 29 percent of the gross portfolio;&#13;
nine were in sub-Saharan Africa; 11 were for South-South projects, where&#13;
the investor is from a developing country; and 11 were investments involving small-&#13;
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This past year also saw MIGA providing&#13;
first-time coverage for projects in four new countries, bringing the total number of&#13;
member countries that have hosted MIGA-supported projects to 82.&#13;
     The demand for MIGA's technical assistance increased markedly during fiscal&#13;
2002--emphasizing the important role that MIGA can play in helping countries&#13;
compete for limited FDI flows. Some 34 technical assistance projects encom-&#13;
passing 77 activities in 27 countries were undertaken during the year, reflecting con-&#13;
tinued strong demand for MIGA's hands-on investment promotion assistance. The&#13;
year also saw the launch of FDI Xchange, a customized e-mail update service linked&#13;
to MIGA's suite of online services, and the undertaking of an extensive survey of&#13;
international investors, which was published in January 2002.&#13;
     In fiscal 2002, MIGA continued to strengthen partnerships with national&#13;
export credit agencies and international financial institutions; this was reflected by&#13;
the signing of 12 additional Memoranda of Understanding. The Agency also con-&#13;
tinued to develop its targeted marketing campaign, including building an effective&#13;
presence in the field. Stakeholder feedback continues to show that an on-the-&#13;
ground presence is key to identifying and underwriting projects in priority areas.&#13;
MIGA's experience has shown that this presence strengthens ties with member&#13;
governments, local investment communities, other insurers and our development&#13;
partners, while enabling MIGA to engage more effectively with the NGO com-&#13;
munity and local media.&#13;
     MIGA established its first long-term presence in Africa, with the opening of the&#13;
southern Africa office in Johannesburg in March 2002. The office will focus on&#13;
encouraging investments into the region. Meanwhile, the Paris office, which was&#13;
established in the second half of fiscal 2001, has allowed MIGA to strengthen its ties&#13;
with one of our largest investor bases--the European business community.&#13;
Elsewhere, MIGA continued to have full-time representation in Tokyo, and part-time&#13;
representation in Turkey, Thailand and India. These offices have played an&#13;

&#13;
In this Annual Report, four development themes are highlighted that&#13;
showcase MIGA's unique role and market niche.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SUPPORTING BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE addresses the consid-&#13;
erable developmental impacts that infrastructure projects bring to&#13;
countries and communities. Infrastructure deals are typically large&#13;
and complex, requiring careful risk management, and MIGA's&#13;
guarantees are often a vital enabling factor, allowing the projects&#13;
to go forward.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
REBUILDING CONFLICT-AFFECTED COUNTRIES demonstrates the&#13;
important role that MIGA can play in attracting foreign investment&#13;
into challenging post-war environments, where capital and skills are&#13;
critically needed, but where international investor confidence is low.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ENCOURAGING          CROSS-BORDER           INVESTMENT         AMONG&#13;
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES recognizes the role MIGA can play in&#13;
supporting potential investors from developing countries who often&#13;
do not have easy access to public or private insurance. These&#13;
investors are therefore especially reliant on a multinational insurance&#13;
provider such as MIGA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STRENGTHENING INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY illustrates how,&#13;
through its technical assistance services, MIGA is well positioned to&#13;
help countries improve their investment climate and better position&#13;
themselves to attract FDI.&#13;

Lack of infrastructure is inextricably linked to poverty. The numbers of "infrastructure poor" are vast,&#13;
and growing, in every region of the developing world. The statistics are sobering: some 1.2 billion&#13;
people currently lack access to safe, potable water. Inadequate sanitation, and the diseases it spreads,&#13;
affects 2.4 billion people. An estimated 2.5 billion people remain without modern sources of energy,&#13;
and unpaved roads limit access to jobs, schools, clinics, and markets.&#13;

REBUILDING CONFLICT-AFFECTED&#13;
COUNTRIES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Countries emerging from conflict typically face multiple challenges in rebuilding homes, schools, fac-&#13;
tories, banks, communications networks, and other key infrastructure. The currency is weak, human&#13;
resources diminished, and key institutions seriously impaired, all factors leading to profound,&#13;
extensive poverty. In fact, of the 39 countries the World Bank currently considers to be conflict-affected,&#13;
30 are among the world's poorest.&#13;

Increased flows of foreign direct investment can support economic development in a struggling&#13;
nation. Such investment can mean more--and better--jobs, improvements in infrastructure, access&#13;
to technology, and the realization of local and national development objectives. However, if developing&#13;
nations are to succeed in expanding FDI flows, they must have in place an attractive legal and regu-&#13;
latory environment and be equipped with the skills and tools to support pro-active marketing of an&#13;

record-setting figures achieved in fiscal 2001. Guarantees business was most affected by the&#13;
slowdown in the global economy, coupled with the negative effects of the Argentine crisis on investor&#13;
confidence. Nevertheless, during fiscal 2002, MIGA issued 58 contracts for $1.358 billion of coverage&#13;
in support of 33 new projects and five previously-supported projects (Table 3). Fiscal 2002 also saw&#13;
first-time coverage offered for projects in four new African countries: Benin, Mauritania, Nigeria and&#13;
Senegal. Collectively, these projects facilitated an estimated $4.7 billion in foreign direct investment&#13;
into developing countries. These results bring total coverage issued over the course of MIGA's history&#13;
to $10.3 billion, and the amount of foreign direct investment facilitated into developing countries to an&#13;
estimated $45.8 billion. As of fiscal year-end, gross exposure stood at $5.3 billion.&#13;

RESERVE FOR CLAIMS&#13;
The provision for claims amounted to US$43.9 million after foreign currency translation of US$1.5 million and recovery&#13;
&#13;
of US$1.7 million. The provision reflected the establishment of a Specific Reserve for MIGA's exposure in Argentina&#13;
&#13;
and a modest increase in the General Reserve. By June 30, 2002, MIGA's Reserve for Claims comprised Specific Claims&#13;
&#13;
Reserves of US$44.9 million (US$0.5 million in FY01) and General Claims Reserves of US$297.3 million&#13;

Total administrative expenses for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002 amounted to US$21.9 million, compared with an&#13;

RISK BEARING CAPACITY&#13;
MIGA's risk bearing capacity continues to be satisfactory, with the ratios of Operating Capital and Operating Income to&#13;
&#13;
claims reserves at 2.4 times and 23.3 percent respectively. (See Table). Both ratios measure the capacity to absorb losses,&#13;
&#13;
the former by reference to capital and reserves, and the latter by reference to earnings generation. Another measure is the&#13;
&#13;
ratio of claims reserves to net exposure, which provides a measure of the relative risk that is latent in the portfolio from&#13;
&#13;
year to year. This ratio remains stable at 9.3 percent.&#13;

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PURPOSE&#13;
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), established on April 12, 1988, is a member of The World Bank&#13;
&#13;
Group, which also includes the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International&#13;
&#13;
Finance Corporation (IFC), and the International Development Association (IDA). MIGA's activities are closely coor-&#13;
&#13;
dinated with and complement the overall development objectives of the other World Bank institutions. MIGA is&#13;
&#13;
designed to help developing countries attract productive foreign investment by both private investors and commercially&#13;
&#13;
operated public sector companies. Its facilities include guarantees or insurance against noncommercial risks and a&#13;
&#13;
program of advisory services and technical assistance to support member countries' efforts to attract and retain foreign&#13;
&#13;
direct investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE A: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES&#13;
&#13;
MIGA's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with International Accounting Standards and with&#13;
&#13;
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The policy adopted is that considered most&#13;
&#13;
appropriate to the circumstances of MIGA having regard to its legal requirements and to the practices of other interna-&#13;
&#13;
tional insurance entities. On July 31, 2002, subsequent to their endorsement by the Audit Committee, the Executive Vice&#13;
&#13;
President of MIGA, duly authorized by the President, approved the financial statements for issue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Accounting Standards and&#13;
&#13;
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and&#13;
&#13;
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those&#13;
&#13;
estimates. The following summary of policies adopted by MIGA is provided to assist readers in the interpretation of these&#13;
&#13;
financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Translation of Currencies MIGA's financial statements are expressed in terms of United States dollars solely for the&#13;
&#13;
purpose of summarizing MIGA's financial position and the results of its operations for the convenience of its members&#13;
&#13;
and other interested parties.&#13;
&#13;
     MIGA is an international organization that may conduct its operations in the currencies of all its members. MIGA's&#13;
&#13;
resources are derived from its capital and retained earnings in its members' currencies. MIGA strives to minimize&#13;
&#13;
exchange rate risks in a multi currency environment. As such, MIGA attempts to match its contingent obligations in any&#13;
&#13;
one currency with assets in the same currency on a pro-rata basis.&#13;
&#13;
     MIGA may periodically undertake currency conversions on a pro-rata basis to match the currencies underlying its&#13;
&#13;
reserves with those of the outstanding contingencies. The purpose of these conversions will be to minimize currency&#13;
&#13;
exposure that may occur through operations. Otherwise, MIGA will not convert one currency into another except for&#13;
&#13;
small amounts required to meet certain operational needs.&#13;
&#13;
     Assets and liabilities are translated at market exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Capital sub-&#13;
&#13;
scriptions are stated in accordance with the procedures described below. Income and expenses are translated at either&#13;
&#13;
the market exchange rate in effect on the dates on which they are recognized or at an average of the market exchange&#13;
&#13;
rates in effect during each month. Translation adjustments are charged or credited to accumulated other compre-&#13;
&#13;
hensive income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Valuation of Capital Stock Under the MIGA Convention, all payments from members subscribing to the capital stock of&#13;
&#13;
MIGA shall be settled on the basis of the average value of the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) in terms of United States&#13;
&#13;
dollars for the period January 1, 1981 to June 30, 1985, such value being equal to $1.082 for one SDR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Investments As part of its overall portfolio management strategy, to diversify its credit exposure to commercial banks&#13;
&#13;
and to obtain higher returns, MIGA invests in government and agency obligations and time deposits according to its&#13;
&#13;
credit risk and maturity policies. Government and agency obligations include highly rated fixed rate bonds, notes, bills&#13;
&#13;
and other obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of countries or other official entities&#13;
&#13;
including government agencies or by multilateral organizations.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                         76  MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT GUARANTEE AGENCY WORLD BANK GROUP&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      Investments classified as available-for-sale, which are those securities that may be sold prior to maturity as part of&#13;
&#13;
asset/liability management or in response to other factors, are carried at fair value with any changes in fair value reported&#13;
&#13;
in the Balance Sheet as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Revenue Recognition Revenue from premium payments for direct insurance and reinsurance contracts assumed and&#13;
&#13;
ceded is recognized on a pro-rata basis over the contract period. Revenue from commitment fees, which are fees paid by&#13;
&#13;
investors to reserve for a limited period of time guarantee capacity for future use, is recognized on a pro-rata basis over&#13;
&#13;
the commitment period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Reserve for Claims The reserve for claims provides for probable losses, net of future premiums, inherent in guarantee&#13;
&#13;
operations based upon an estimation of the net present value of future premium income as compared to the net present&#13;
&#13;
value of future losses related to guarantee operations. MIGA has incurred only one loss to date (see Note D). Accordingly,&#13;
&#13;
MIGA has computed expected future losses by reference to (i) the loss experiences of other insurers engaged in similar&#13;
&#13;
underwriting, (ii) the composition and volume of outstanding guarantee contracts, and (iii) the worldwide economic and&#13;
&#13;
political environment. This reserve is available to absorb probable losses inherent in outstanding guarantees and is&#13;
&#13;
increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by claims settlements.&#13;
&#13;
      The level of provision is based upon management's evaluation of probable losses, net of future premiums, that may&#13;
&#13;
result from (i) risks that are inherent, but unidentifiable at the time of reporting, (ii) large concentrations of exposure to&#13;
&#13;
individual risks, countries or guarantee contracts, and (iii) an ongoing assessment of MIGA's expected recovery rates.&#13;
&#13;
Sufficient claims reserves are established at the end of each year to cover all of the inherent probable losses arising from&#13;
&#13;
contracts outstanding at that time on a net present value basis; future provisions are then established to reflect changes&#13;
&#13;
in MIGA's outstanding portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
      In the event of a formal filing of claim by an investor, and upon receipt of full evidence of the occurrence of the&#13;
&#13;
covered risk, MIGA normally has between two months and six months to determine its liability under the contract,&#13;
&#13;
depending upon the type of coverage and contract terms, and 60 days thereafter to pay the claim.&#13;

NOTE C: CAPITAL STOCK&#13;
&#13;
The MIGA Convention established MIGA's authorized capital stock at 100,000 shares with a provision that the authorized&#13;
&#13;
capital stock shall automatically increase on the admission of a new member to the extent that the then authorized shares&#13;
&#13;
are insufficient to provide the shares to be subscribed by such member. At June 30, 2002, the initial authorized capital&#13;
&#13;
stock increased to 102,783 (102,324­June 30, 2001) shares. The Convention further states that 10 percent of the members'&#13;
&#13;
initial subscription be paid in cash, in freely convertible currencies, except that developing member countries may pay up&#13;
&#13;
to a quarter of the 10 percent in their own currencies. An additional 10 percent of the initial subscription shall be paid in&#13;
&#13;
the form of nonnegotiable, non interest bearing promissory notes. The notes are denominated in freely convertible cur-&#13;
&#13;
rencies and are due on demand to meet MIGA's obligations. The remaining 80 percent is subject to call when required by&#13;
&#13;
MIGA to meet its obligations.&#13;
&#13;
      On March 29, 1999, the Council of Governors approved a resolution increasing the authorized capital stock of MIGA&#13;
&#13;
by 78,559 shares to be subscribed by members during the subscription period ending March 28, 2002. On May 6, 2002,&#13;
&#13;
the Council of Governors adopted the resolution to extend the General Capital Increase subscription period to March 28,&#13;
&#13;
2003. Of the additional capital, 17.65 percent is to be paid in cash, in freely usable currency. The remaining 82.35 percent&#13;
&#13;
is subject to call when required by MIGA to meet its obligations.&#13;
&#13;
      At June 30, 2002, MIGA's authorized capital stock comprised 181,342 shares of which 158,349 (132,869­June 30, 2001)&#13;
&#13;
shares had been subscribed. Each share has a par value of SDR10,000, valued at the rate of $1.082 per SDR. Of the sub-&#13;
&#13;
scribed capital, $327,807,000 ($279,031,000­June 30, 2001) has been paid in; $731,000 ($731,000­June 30, 2001) is due&#13;
&#13;
and the remaining $1,384,798,000 ($1,157,881,000­June 30, 2001) is subject to call. Of the amounts paid in, at June 30,&#13;
&#13;
2002, $103,007,000 ($100,921,000­June 30, 2001) is in the form of nonnegotiable, non interest bearing demand obli-&#13;

Guarantee Program MIGA offers guarantees or insurance against loss caused by noncommercial risks (political risk&#13;
                                                                                                                                              Financial&#13;
insurance) to eligible investors on qualified investments in developing member countries. MIGA insures investments for&#13;
&#13;
up to 20 years against four different categories of risk: currency inconvertibility and transfer restriction, expropriation, war&#13;
&#13;
and civil disturbance, and breach of contract. Currency inconvertibility and transfer restriction protects the investor from&#13;
&#13;
inconvertibility of local currency into foreign exchange for transfer outside the host country. Currency depreciation is not&#13;
&#13;
covered. Expropriation protects the investor against partial or total loss of the insured investment as a result of acts by the&#13;
&#13;
host government that may reduce or eliminate ownership of, control over, or rights to the insured investment. War and&#13;
&#13;
civil disturbance protects the investor against losses from damage to, or the destruction or disappearance of, tangible&#13;
&#13;
assets caused by politically motivated acts of war or civil disturbance in the host country including revolution, insur-&#13;
&#13;
rection, coups d'etat, sabotage and terrorism. Breach of contract protects the investor against the impossibility to obtain&#13;
&#13;
or to enforce an arbitral or judicial decision recognizing the breach of an obligation by the host government. Investors may&#13;
&#13;
insure projects for any combination of the four types of coverage. MIGA guarantees, cannot be terminated unilaterally by&#13;
&#13;
the guarantee holder within the first three years from the date of issuance. Premium rates applicable to issued contracts&#13;
&#13;
are fixed for five years. Payments against all claims under a guarantee may not exceed the maximum amount of coverage&#13;
&#13;
issued under the guarantee.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                          MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT GUARANTEE AGENCY WORLD BANK GROUP                   79&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      As approved by the Board of Directors and the Council of Governors, the maximum aggregate amount of contingent&#13;
&#13;
liabilities that may be assumed by MIGA is 350 percent of the sum of MIGA's unimpaired subscribed capital and its&#13;
&#13;
reserves plus such portion of the insurance ceded by MIGA through contracts of reinsurance as the Board of Directors&#13;
&#13;
may determine. Accordingly, at June 30, 2002, the maximum level of guarantees outstanding may not exceed&#13;
&#13;
$9,156,960,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Contingent Liability The maximum amount of contingent liability of MIGA under guarantees outstanding at June 30,&#13;
&#13;
2002 totaled $5,256,599,000 ($5,179,040,000-June 30, 2001). The maximum amount of contingent liability is MIGA's&#13;
&#13;
maximum exposure to insurance claims, which includes "standby" coverage for which MIGA is committed but not cur-&#13;
&#13;
rently at risk. At June 30, 2002, MIGA's estimate of its actual exposure to insurance claims exclusive of standby coverage&#13;
&#13;
is $2,563,671,000 ($2,628,939,000-June 30, 2001).&#13;
&#13;
      As of June 30, 2002, additional guarantee capacity committed was nil ($0-June 30, 2001).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Claim Activity In June 2000, MIGA paid its first claim, an expropriation claim related to a power project in Indonesia,&#13;
&#13;
amounting to $15,000,000, of which 70% was reinsured. The net amount paid by MIGA was $4,500,000. MIGA has&#13;
&#13;
entered into a settlement agreement with Indonesia under which the loss should be repaid in six semi-annual payments&#13;
&#13;
of principal and interest on the outstanding balance. As at June 30, 2002, in accordance with the terms of the settlement&#13;
&#13;
agreement, four installments totaling $11,350,000 have been received. MIGA has retained $3,405,000 (30%).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE E: REINSURANCE&#13;
&#13;
Although MIGA obtains quota-share and facultative reinsurance to augment its underwriting capacity and to protect&#13;
&#13;
portions of its insurance portfolio, it remains responsible to the insured client for the entire amount of the insurance&#13;
&#13;
contract. Of the $5,256,599,000 outstanding contingent liability (gross exposure) at June 30, 2002 ($5,179,040,000-June&#13;
&#13;
30, 2001), $2,055,148,000 was ceded through contracts of reinsurance ($2,022,603,000-June 30, 2001). Net exposure&#13;
&#13;
amounted to $3,201,451,000 as at June 30, 2002 ($3,156,437,000-June 30, 2001).&#13;
&#13;
      MIGA can also provide both public (official) and private insurers with facultative reinsurance. As of June 30, 2002,&#13;
&#13;
total insurance assumed by MIGA, primarily with official investment insurers, amounted to $94,217,000 ($99,882,000-&#13;
&#13;
June 30, 2001).&#13;

&#13;
MIGA has accounted for potential problems in its Argentinean portfolio resulting from the economic crisis that unfolded&#13;
&#13;
during fiscal year 2002. At June 30, 2002, total provisioning under the Specific Reserve for Argentinean contracts&#13;
&#13;
amounted to $44.4 million. This amount was established to address potential problems in MIGA's Argentina portfolio&#13;
&#13;
resulting from the economic crisis that started to unfold in December 2001. In addition, MIGA provided $0.5 million&#13;
&#13;
which was established to cover credit risk associated with the recovery of a claim paid in Indonesia in fiscal year 2000.&#13;
&#13;
       Reinsurance recoverables have been estimated in proportion to the reserve for claims and on the basis of a review&#13;
&#13;
of the selected contracts in force and other available information.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
NOTE G: STAFF RETIREMENT PLAN AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT&#13;
BENEFITS&#13;
&#13;
IBRD has a defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP) and a Post-Employment&#13;
&#13;
Benefits plan (PEBP) that cover substantially all of its staff members as well as the staff of IFC and of MIGA.&#13;
&#13;
       The SRP provides regular pension benefits and includes a cash balance plan. The RSBP provides certain health and&#13;
&#13;
life insurance benefits to eligible retirees. The PEBP provides pension benefits administered outside the SRP. All costs asso-&#13;
&#13;
ciated with these plans are allocated between IBRD, IFC, and MIGA based upon their employees' respective participation&#13;
&#13;
in the plans. In addition, IFC and MIGA reimburse IBRD for their share of any contributions made to these plans by IBRD.&#13;
&#13;
       Net income from the SRP that has been allocated to MIGA for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002 was $2,150,098             Statements&#13;
($2,858,000­June 30, 2001). The portion of the cost for RSBP and the PEBP for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002 was&#13;
&#13;
$269,000 ($162,600­June 30, 2001). In addition, at June 30, 2002, MIGA had a receivable from IBRD in the amount of&#13;
                                                                                                                                            Financial&#13;
$15,674,213 ($13,644,847­June 30, 2001) representing the accumulated excess of its contributions to pension assets over&#13;
&#13;
its allocated net periodic pension cost.&#13;

NOTE H: SERVICE AND SUPPORT FEE&#13;
&#13;
MIGA obtains certain administrative and overhead services from IBRD in those areas where common services can be effi-&#13;
&#13;
ciently provided by IBRD. This includes shared costs of the Boards of Governors and Directors, and other services such&#13;
&#13;
as communications, internal auditing, administrative support, supplies and insurance. Payments for these services are&#13;
&#13;
made by MIGA to IBRD based on negotiated fees, charge backs and allocated charges where charge back is not feasible.&#13;
&#13;
Expenses allocated to MIGA for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002, were $1,170,476 ($1,008,306-June 30, 2001).&#13;

NOTE I: ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES&#13;
&#13;
The estimated fair values of MIGA's cash and nonnegotiable, non interest-bearing demand obligations are assumed to&#13;
&#13;
approximate their carrying values. The estimated fair value of MIGA's investments shown in Note B is based on market&#13;
&#13;
quotations. The estimated fair values are only indicative of individual financial instruments' values and should not be con-&#13;
&#13;
sidered an indication of MIGA's fair value.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
NOTE J: SUBSEQUENT EVENT&#13;
&#13;
On July 18, 2002, MIGA received notification of a claim for a project in Argentina with a maximum liability of $5 million.&#13;
&#13;
Such risks of this nature have been taken into consideration when establishing Specific Reserves at June 30, 2002.&#13;

            Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
            (MIGA) 2002 annual report
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Multilateral Investment Guarantee
            Agency (MIGA) 2002 annual report, discusses the challenges
            for MIGA during FY02, when a confluence of events, a
            troubled world economy, and the financial crisis in
            Argentina, combined to have a significant negative impact on
            investor confidence, and foreign direct investments (FDI)
            flows to developing countries. Project financing has been
            harder to obtain, and the combination of economic, and
            political uncertainty, has led to many projects being put on
            hold. The result has been a decline in the level of
            worldwide investment flows into developing countries.
            Notwithstanding, for the year, MIGA supported 33 projects,
            issuing 58 guarantees totaling $1.357 billion of coverage
            (including the amount insured through the Cooperative
            Underwriting Program). During this period, MIGA also
            provided first-time coverage for projects in four new
            countries, bringing the total number of member countries
            that have hosted MIGA-supported projects to 82. The demand
            for MIGA's technical assistance increased markedly
            during FY02 - emphasizing the important role that MIGA can
            play in helping countries compete for limited FDI flows. It
            continued to strengthen partnerships with national export
            credit agencies, and international financial institutions;
            this was reflected by the signing of 12 additional Memoranda
            of Understanding. The Agency also continued to develop its
            targeted marketing campaign, including building an effective
            presence in the field. Highlights discussed in this report
            include supporting basic infrastructure; rebuilding
            conflict-affected countries; encouraging cross-border
            investment among developing countries; and, strengthening
            institutional capacity.
