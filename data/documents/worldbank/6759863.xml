                             A. BACKGROUND AND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               1. Country and Sector Background&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.     Agriculture remains the single largest contributor to the livelihood of the Nigeria's rural&#13;
poor, despite losing its position as Nigeria's prime foreign exchange earner to the oil sector. One&#13;
of the most serious challenges facing Nigeria in the 21" century is achieving sustainable growth&#13;
in the agricultural sector which provides employment and livelihoods to 65 percent of rural&#13;
dwellers in a human population of about 130 million. Agriculture accounts for about 34.8&#13;
percent of Nigeria's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Livestock (14 million cattle, 34.5 million&#13;
goats, 22 million sheep, 3.4 million pigs and 175 million poultry), in turn, contribute about 13&#13;
percent to agricultural GDP. Based on Nigeria's 2004 GDP of US$50.2 billion, the country's&#13;
livestock resources were estimated at US$2 billion during that year. Mixed farming systems are&#13;
predominant. However, productivity is low and the demand for meat, dairy, pork and poultry&#13;
outstrips domestic supply. Poultry production in Nigeria can be classified into extensive and&#13;
intensive systems. The extensive system consists of over 143 million rural free ranging poultry.&#13;
The intensive system is of two major types, urban backyard poultry flocks of about 200 to 2000&#13;
birds, and commercial enterprises with more than 2000 birds. Productivity in these systems is&#13;
typically constrained by poor nutrition and diseases.&#13;
&#13;
2.      In Nigeria, like in most African countries, a substantial part of animal health services is&#13;
managed by the public sector, which with declining funding has become increasingly weak. The&#13;
three tiers of government, i.e., federal, states and local, are involved in the administration of&#13;
agriculture, including veterinary services.      At the federal level, government thrust is the&#13;
development of policies and policy implementation protocols, monitoring and coordination of&#13;
developmental programs, national disease control, tsetse eradication and development of relevant&#13;
legislation. At the state level, Veterinary Services (VS) are headed by Directors at the State&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture or, in a few cases, the Ministry of Animal Health, Livestock and&#13;
Fisheries Resources.      The Federal Department of Livestock and Pest Control Services&#13;
(FDL&amp;PCS) acts as a facilitator where interstate and international inspection, hygiene and trade&#13;
of food of animal origin are concerned.&#13;
&#13;
3.      In addition to federal and state governments, local governments participate in VS mainly&#13;
as mobilization and extension agents and liaise closely with the state Area Veterinary Officers&#13;
(AVOS), livestock farmers, traditional institutions, law enforcement agents and other&#13;
stakeholders to facilitate services delivery, disease reporting, control of livestock diseases and&#13;
pests, etc. The Local Government VeterinaryILivestock Services are usually headed by the&#13;
Heads of Agriculture Departments, which generally comprise veterinary services, poultry&#13;
development, fisheries, forestry, crop production, and livestock production divisions.&#13;
&#13;
4.      The Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) has introduced a number of policies to enable&#13;
the private sector contribute and provide services to the farmers. Such policies in the livestock&#13;
sub-sector include creating the enabling environment for the manufacture and distribution of&#13;
veterinary drugs, agro-chemicals and livestock feeds by the private sector and encouragement of&#13;
veterinary surgeons to go into private practice. Private veterinarians are mainly engaged in the&#13;
supply and distribution of veterinary drugs, vaccines, equipment and livestock feeds, and in the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
provision of routine clinical services, preventive herd health, and consultancy services. With the&#13;
declining funding of the public sector and the increasing deterioration of infrastructure and&#13;
equipment, the core public functions of VS need to be strengthened and the roles of the public&#13;
and private sectors in the provision of services needs to be further defined. This is one of the&#13;
major issues being tackled by the FDL&amp;PCS through the Pan-African Program for the Control of&#13;
Epizootics (PACE), which has developed a draft Act in an attempt to streamline the functions of&#13;
the two major existing complementary legislations, the proposed Veterinary Practice Act.&#13;
&#13;
5.     Veterinary institutions play a vital role in the livestock sub-sector in Nigeria. One such&#13;
important institution is the National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI). This institute is the&#13;
national reference laboratory for the diagnosis and investigation of livestock diseases and&#13;
collaborates with international reference laboratories. NVRI is also involved in the production&#13;
and testing of vaccines for the control of animal diseases in the country and conducts research&#13;
and training in relevant veterinary fields. At present, Nigeria has five federal universities in&#13;
Ibadan, Maiduguri, Nsukka, Sokoto, and Zaria, each with fully developed faculties of veterinary&#13;
medicine and veterinary teaching hospitals (VTHs). These institutions train veterinarians at both&#13;
undergraduate and postgraduate levels and conduct research in all areas of veterinary medicine.&#13;
In addition, colleges of veterinary medicine were recently established in the three federal&#13;
universities of agriculture in Abeokuta, Makurdi, and Umudike. Three colleges of animal health&#13;
and production located in Ibadan, Kaduna, and Vom also provide training for sub-professional&#13;
and technical personnel in various livestock related fields.&#13;
&#13;
6.     To enforce legislation of drugs, vaccines, agro-chemicals and meat hygiene regulatory&#13;
bodies have been established, but are outdated and in need of review, in order to reposition the&#13;
veterinary profession and animal health care delivery services in their proper place. In addition&#13;
to inadequate public funding of animal health care delivery, the various tiers of government do&#13;
not currently employ have sufficient numbers of veterinarians. Thus, there is a great potential to&#13;
tap into the private veterinary manpower resources to implement core veterinary public health&#13;
functions (e.g., preventionlcontrol/eradication of avian flu; prevention of human cases; and food&#13;
inspection, etc.) under the overall control of official veterinary authorities.&#13;
&#13;
7.     To protect animal and human health, the existing laws and legislations (i.e., the Animal&#13;
Diseases Control Act 10 of 1988, the States' Meat Hygiene Legislation of 1969, the Veterinary&#13;
Surgeons Act of 1987, etc.) are being reviewed, while new ones, such as the proposed Veterinary&#13;
Practice Act, are being developed to address issues related to:&#13;
&#13;
              Control and sales of veterinary drugs and biologicals as well as animal health&#13;
              inputs;&#13;
              Abattoir management and meat hygiene;&#13;
              Roles of private and public VS;&#13;
              Enforcement of laws and legislations;&#13;
              Control of veterinary drug residues and mycotoxins in food of animal origin.&#13;
&#13;
8.     At the post-appraisal meeting of February 23, 2006, the FGN team gave the assurance&#13;
that the ongoing revision of existing laws will not have any negative impact on the Project since&#13;
the proposed amendments to the Project are mainly intended to give veterinary authorities a&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
greater control in veterinary drug administration and meat hygiene. The amendment process has&#13;
reached an advanced stage and the first draft has been cleared by the Federal Ministry of Justice.&#13;
&#13;
9.      The future presents very strong challenges for protecting animal and human health from&#13;
major diseases, including zoonoses, food security and securing international trade. The main&#13;
constraint lies in the current limited capacity of VS for the early detection and rapid response to&#13;
outbreaks of highly contagious diseases of animal origin, as well as for food safety.&#13;
&#13;
10.     Constraints to the eradication of livestock diseases and zoonoses, inadequate policies and&#13;
regulatory frameworks, and lack of veterinary training and funding are hampering the&#13;
effectiveness of VS in Nigeria. The future direction for the public sector should point to the&#13;
improvement of the enabling environment in which the private sector can thrive, the&#13;
development of supporting legislation, strengthening regulatory institutions, enforcement of&#13;
ethics, and disease surveillance and reporting. The private sector be geared towards providing&#13;
full clinical services and input delivery. The complementary functions of private practitioners&#13;
and the roles and functions of other para-veterinary professionals in animal health delivery need&#13;
to be recognized and encouraged and harmonized. These objectives have been recently adopted&#13;
by the Office International des Epizootics (OIE) of the World Organization for Animal Health,&#13;
and are supported by specific international standards, guidelines and tools. The deterioration of&#13;
animal health care delivery in Nigeria can be reversed collectively by improving technical,&#13;
leadership and entrepreneurial skills.&#13;
&#13;
1I.     With the outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI 5N1) in Nigeria, the VS&#13;
have been severely challenged, increasing the need to critically examine the individual roles and&#13;
functions of the various players and organizations involved in animal health care delivery&#13;
services in the country.     The existing laboratories that have been earmarked to carry out&#13;
diagnosis of HPAI include the NVRI and VTHs at Ibadan, Maiduguri, Nsukka, Sokoto, and&#13;
Zaria, but need to be strengthened.          Laboratory diagnostic networking should include&#13;
laboratories in neighboring countries and the West African sub-region. The prospect for a&#13;
Technical Cooperation Project (TCP) to enhance HPAI diagnostic capacity should be explored&#13;
with the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO).&#13;
&#13;
12.     There are no rendering plants in Nigeria. Disposal of animal carcasses is done through&#13;
burial or bio-thermal decomposition. Animal owners are, by law, required to inform a public&#13;
veterinarian when an animal is suspected to have died of a notifiable disease, such as, CBPP,&#13;
haemorrhagic septicemia, Anthrax, Rinderpest, African Swine Fever, etc. In the case of HPAI,&#13;
FGN has adapted the contingency manual for A1 prepared by the Centro Regionale per&#13;
1'Epidemiologia Veterinaria (CREV) and by the Italian National Reference Laboratory for Avian&#13;
Influenza, at the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (see Appendix 3 for details).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                            2. Overall Country Damage Assessment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
13.    HPAI is a trans-boundary viral zoonotic disease (animal-to-human transmission) of&#13;
international importance because of its devastating socioeconomic impacts and the potential&#13;
capacity of the virus to 'transmutate' (through genetic re-assortments or mutations) from animal-&#13;
to-animal, to animal-to-human transfer, into the final-stage human-to-human pandemic phase&#13;
transmission. Humans are not very susceptible (low morbidity) but are very sensitive (high&#13;
mortality rate) to the H5N1 strain, once infected. The H5N1 virus strain isolated in Nigeria is&#13;
identical to the strain causing large outbreaks in wild and domestic birds in Asia and Europe,&#13;
creating widespread concern of the increased risk of an emerging highly pathogenic strain that&#13;
can cause a third-phase human pandemic. While it is uncertain whether the current HPAI&#13;
outbreaks may lead to an influenza pandemic, it is certain that its consequences for human safety&#13;
will be severe.&#13;
&#13;
14.    Most of the poultry production systems in Nigeria (extensive and intensive) are at a very&#13;
high risk. There are few large commercial farms with adequate bio-security measures. Though&#13;
the densities of human and poultry populations are generally lower in Africa than in south-east&#13;
Asia (where the current strain of avian influenza emerged in late 2003), its poultry production&#13;
systems have many similarities that can create multiple opportunities for human exposure. In&#13;
Nigeria, poultry farming is mostly household-based with small flocks of chickens, usually free-&#13;
ranging, and in close contact with wild birds as well as with human beings. Rural households are&#13;
tend to depend on their livestock, especially poultry, as the main source of income and dietary&#13;
protein. It is an urgent to strengthen the capacity of VS as the first responder to mitigate these&#13;
economic and public health risks and attack the virus at its animal source. Such an approach is&#13;
the first and most cost-effective measure to minimize further spread of the virus into the&#13;
environment, allow it to become endemic, and prevent a human pandemic. It will also be&#13;
necessary to strengthen the necessary diagnostic expertise, disease surveillance, and control and&#13;
management systems to counter the emergence of a human pandemic.&#13;
&#13;
15.     The devastating socio-economic consequences of HPAI in Asia have underscored the&#13;
importance of this Project to Nigeria and the West Africa region. In Asia to date, over 200&#13;
million domestic poultry have either died or have been destroyed and 175people have contracted&#13;
the infection, of which, at the time of writing, 93 have died as a direct result of HPAI infection.&#13;
Over 200 million Asian households have lost their livelihood, and economic losses to the Asian&#13;
poultry sector alone are already estimated at well over $10 billion, with enormous and&#13;
unprecedented social and economic impacts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    3. Regional Implications&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
16.     The incidence of newly emerging transboundary zoonoses is increasing worldwide as the&#13;
result of the unprecedented confluence of people, animals and animal products. The current&#13;
avian influenza epizootic demonstrates the global importance of newly emerging diseases in&#13;
terms of human health and well-being. In addition, emerging zoonoses of public health concern&#13;
are also a sobering reminder of the tremendous socio-economic and trade damages that such&#13;
diseases can cause to the developed and developing countries.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17.     The HPAI outbreaks in Nigeria pose serious threats to West and Central Africa, through&#13;
the uncontrolled legal and illegal trade in infected domestic and wild birds or their products, as&#13;
well as through migration of wild birds (see Figure Al, Appendix 1). Bird flu can spread rapidly&#13;
among poultry and wild birds, including migratory species (especially the Anatidae family that&#13;
includes ducks, geese and swan), and can be transmitted to humans through physical contact with&#13;
infected animals or contaminated products. The probability of bird flu spreading across Nigeria&#13;
is a realistic possibility, since the country, a regional economic power, has many trade links with&#13;
many countries in the sub-region. Already, countries surrounding Nigeria (Benin, Cameroon,&#13;
Chad, Ghana, Niger and Togo) have taken measures to increase surveillance and some have&#13;
imposed import bans on poultry and poultry products from Nigeria. However, the limited&#13;
resources and expertise available in these countries to enforce regulations are putting the entire&#13;
region at risk. Should avian flu become endemic in Africa, the consequences for a region&#13;
already devastated by hunger and poverty could be truly catastrophic. In addition, the prevalence&#13;
of HIVIAIDS in Africa could increase the number of human cases, as the result of depressed&#13;
immunity of persons infected with HIVIAIDS. Unlike other regions of the world that have well&#13;
established plans to contain the spread of the bird flu virus, most African countries lacks such&#13;
plans to fight such highly contagious zoonotic diseases.&#13;
&#13;
18.     The Bank and its UN partners are well positioned to provide technical, human, and&#13;
material assistance to Nigeria and the region. If control measures are not undertaken, the disease&#13;
will continue to spread, causing further economic losses and threatening the livelihoods of&#13;
hundreds of millions of poor livestock farmers, jeopardizing smallholder entrepreneurship and&#13;
commercial poultry production, and seriously impeding regional and international trade and&#13;
market opportunities. The rural poor, who rely for a large share of their income on poultry, will&#13;
be hard hit, particularly with income losses and social distress.&#13;
&#13;
               1&#13;
                                     4. The National Dimension&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
19.     Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and is home to about 175million domestic&#13;
poultry, of which the vast majority of 143 million are free ranging. In January 2006, the first&#13;
HPAI outbreak in poultry was reported on commercial farms in Kaduna, Kano and Plateau states&#13;
in Northern Nigeria (see the Map, Appendix 14). By February 8, 2006, the Kaduna State&#13;
outbreak was confirmed by the HPAI OIEIFAO reference laboratory in Padua, Italy as the HPAI&#13;
H5N1 strain. The country is ill-prepared to contain the spread of the H5N1 virus and will need&#13;
considerable support. Overall, diagnostic capacity for HPAI is very weak, as are quarantine&#13;
services.    With the ongoing importation ban of poultry and poultry products, long term&#13;
enforcement of the ban is doubtful, creating risks not only for Nigeria but also for the region.&#13;
&#13;
20.     At donor community briefing of February 10, 2006, the Honorable Minister of&#13;
Agriculture and Rural Development indicated that the virus may have had its source from the&#13;
illegal importation of birds. In addition, Nigeria has large wetland habitats in the north which&#13;
annually play host to a huge array of migratory birds. Disease reporting and infection is also&#13;
constrained by lack of awareness training of farmers, and the availability of emergency funds for&#13;
compensation. The international community welcomed the intention by the government to&#13;
compensate farmers for losses from dead or stamped out poultry and for reporting the outbreak,&#13;
as this should considerably improve the reporting of hture outbreaks. However, the appropriate&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
level and timeliness of compensation will be critical to the successful containment of the disease&#13;
and the fostering of poultry farmer confidence. Under-reporting or illegal dispersion of birds&#13;
may occur the compensation rate is below the going market rates for poultry. Already, past&#13;
experience with Contagious Bovine Pleuro-Pneumonia (CBPP) and Rinderpest epizootics in the&#13;
early eighties has shown reluctance by livestock owners to report cases of reportable diseases&#13;
where this will result in stamping out the herd without compensation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 5. Country Strategy in the Context of Global Program for Avian Influenza and Human&#13;
                   Pandemic Preparedness and Response Program (GPAI)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
21.    In December 2005, FGN set up a Technical Committee of Experts on the prevention and&#13;
control of HPAI which identified the following nine strategies (see Appendix 3):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       (i)     a ban on importation of poultry and poultry products from countries where the&#13;
               disease (HPAI) is known to exist;&#13;
&#13;
       (ii)    effective animal disease surveillance involving high risk areas, such as, poultry&#13;
               markets, wet lands and poultry located along known migratory birds routes,&#13;
               poultry abattoirs, borders and targeted farms;&#13;
&#13;
       (iii)   improved and functional National Veterinary Quarantine Services (NVQS),&#13;
               including immediate rehabilitation and revitalization of existing veterinary&#13;
               quarantine infrastructure, control posts and enhanced manpower capabilities;&#13;
&#13;
        (iv)   community-based training of rural backyard poultry farmers in various aspects of&#13;
               HPAI recognition and control, including bio-security procedures;&#13;
&#13;
       (v)     enforcement of the requirement for import permits for poultry and poultry&#13;
               products;&#13;
&#13;
        (vi)   development of a traceability mechanism for animals and strict monitoring of&#13;
               movement of poultry and poultry products through registration and licensing of&#13;
               poultry farms, hatcheries and other poultry enterprises;&#13;
&#13;
        (vii)  development of a community based, participatory rural livestock and poultry&#13;
               disease surveillance system and integrating it into the existing epidemic-&#13;
               surveillance network;&#13;
&#13;
        (viii) training of veterinarians, auxiliaries, other categories of poultry farmers on HPAI&#13;
               prevention and control strategies, including aspects of bio-security; and&#13;
&#13;
        (ix)   effective public enlightenment and awareness programs on HPAI.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22.     The Federal Ministries of Agriculture, Health and Information are finalizing an integrated&#13;
Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan (AICP) to&#13;
address outbreaks of HPAI in Nigeria. In the context of the World Bank's GPAI, the plan&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
focuses on both animal and human health and on promoting partnership between animal and&#13;
human health agencies to facilitate control of zoonotic diseases.&#13;
&#13;
23.     The animal health component of the Plan is based on a review of the present status of the&#13;
key institutions and services and their readiness to perform their intended tasks. It deals with&#13;
four main themes, namely, surveillance, early detection and rapid containment, control at source&#13;
in birds, and risk communication.       The plan includes strategies for further prevention of&#13;
introduction of HPAI into Nigeria, an HPAI surveillance network, early reaction contingency&#13;
planning, response plan for HPAI, overall policy for HPAI emergency in Nigeria, and an action&#13;
plan for HPAI control. FGN is still debating the merits and demerits of a vaccination policy&#13;
against a policy on stamping out.&#13;
&#13;
24.     The human health part of the national plan aims at strengthening national capacity in key&#13;
public health areas, including inter-sectoral coordination, epidemiological surveillance,&#13;
laboratory diagnosis, disease prevention, clinical case management, and communication. It is&#13;
composed of two main sections. The first section addresses the pandemic alert period (current&#13;
WHO phase 3, but also phases 4 and 5) when animal and human cases may occur, but without&#13;
sustained person-to-person transmission. The focus is on coordination with the VS as well as&#13;
with relevant regional and international organizations, epidemiological surveillance, laboratory&#13;
diagnosis, and clinical management of a limited number of human cases. It also addresses some&#13;
elements of pandemic preparedness. The second section of the human health part addresses the&#13;
pandemic period (WHO phase 6) when effective person-to-person transmission exists. The&#13;
focus is on clinical management of a large number of patients over a relatively short period of&#13;
time, some with severe respiratory infection which may require hospitalization in intensive care&#13;
units.&#13;
&#13;
25.     For both the animal and human health components, the plan provides currently&#13;
acknowledged limitations, proposed activities, and resource requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                         6. Country Response to the HPAI Emergency&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
26.     In anticipation of an eventual HPAI outbreak, FGN inaugurated on December 12, 2005, a&#13;
Technical Committee of Experts for the prevention and control of HPAI. The committee devised&#13;
strategies for the prevention of HPAI in the country consistent with the GPAI. Since the&#13;
outbreak of February 8, 2006, FGN, under the personal leadership of President Obasanjo, moved&#13;
fast to set up a National Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee on Avian Influenza (NISCAI) co-&#13;
chaired by the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Minister of Health, with&#13;
the World Bank as a member. FGN has also set up a National Technical Committee on Avian&#13;
Influenza (NTCAI) chaired by both the Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development&#13;
and the Minister of State for Health.         The Technical Committee is responsible for the&#13;
coordination and implementation of the emergency action plan and strategy proposed for the&#13;
prevention and control of the outbreak.&#13;
&#13;
27.     FGN has taken emergency measures to control the outbreak at source, such as stamping&#13;
out of affected and in-contact flocks, introduction of quarantine measures, animal movement&#13;
bans, and increased bio-security of poultry farms. The Ministry of Health is planning emergency&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
measures to protect farm workers from infection with the virus, increase public awareness and&#13;
information and assess the capacity of the system for effective surveillance and case&#13;
management. Implementation of the preparedness plan by the Ministries of Agriculture, Health&#13;
and Information will be a challenge.              VS are weakand disease surveillance is severely&#13;
constrained by lack of funds, and presently largely depends on external funding. The most&#13;
significant support comes from Pan-African program for the Control of Epizootics (PACE),&#13;
which is due to close in the third quarter of 2006. Even so, the mandate of PACE has been&#13;
restricted to classical threats such as Rinderpest, Newcastle Disease, CBPP, and Foot and Mouth&#13;
Disease (FMD), and is focused mainly on surveillance. Similar challenges exist in the human&#13;
health system where the current disease surveillance system is weak and there is no routine&#13;
human influenza reporting. The national laboratory capacity is limited and the coverage and&#13;
capacity of the health system for effective case management is severely limited.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  7. Country Eligibility under GPAI&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
28.      The proposed Project falls under the GPAI, approved by the Bank's Board of Directors&#13;
on January 16, 2006. GPAI support is to be provided using the horizontal Adaptable Program&#13;
Loan (APL) instrument and within a global coordination framework. Under the global APL,&#13;
individual countries may obtain separate loans and credits and grants, as they become available,&#13;
to finance their own national projects, up to the global aggregate limit of US$5OO million. Since&#13;
the GPAI is designed to provide emergency financing to participating countries to contain&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                         Box 1: Country EligibilityCriteriaunder the GPAI&#13;
&#13;
In view of the wide variation of individual countries' conditions, GPAI projects will need to reflect the&#13;
environment in which they are to be implemented. Accordingly, country requests for assistance are&#13;
eligible for financingunder the GPAIwhen they meet the following criteria:&#13;
&#13;
    (i)   Countries in endemic situation, where new human infectionsare being detected, will need to&#13;
          have prepared and be implementing an HPAI Control Strategy;&#13;
&#13;
    (ii) Newly infected countries, with an active outbreak of avian influenza among poultry but no&#13;
          human infection, will need to have in place an appropriate program of rapid response,&#13;
          detection and containment measures, including implementation and monitoring arrangements&#13;
          that the internationalagenciesand donor community,includingthe Bank, could support;&#13;
&#13;
    (iii) Countries at risk, with no outbreaks or at an early stage of an outbreak, will need to&#13;
          demonstrate governmental commitment to addressing the situation and have in place an&#13;
          appropriate plan for early detection and rapid response, including implementation and&#13;
          monitoring arrangements that the internationalagencies and donor community, including the&#13;
          Bank, could support;&#13;
&#13;
    (iv) Countries with very low income levels and very low capacity will be considered against&#13;
          special criteria, and waivers will apply if a full-blown human pandemic were to materialize to&#13;
          ensure that assistance is available if and when needed, even if the country itself will hardly be&#13;
          able to generate or mobilize any effectiveHPAI response.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
outbreaks of avian flu through early detection and rapid response measures, the country-specific&#13;
operations, such as described for FGN, will be processed under the Bank's emergency policy,&#13;
OP/BP 8.50. The GPAI will treat specific emergency response projects in each country as&#13;
"phases" of a horizontal APL (similar approaches include the Multi-Country HIVIAIDS&#13;
Programs for the African and the Caribbean Regions). Nigeria clearly meets the eligibility&#13;
criteria for "countries newly infected" in GPAI category (ii) (see Box 1 above). But since the&#13;
proposed Project is not included in the Country Partnership Strategy (2005-2009), the financial&#13;
assistance for the Project will be provided as a credit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                           B. BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         1. International Support to the Avian Influenza Emergency in the Country&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
29.     The outbreak of HPAI in Nigeria was the first such confirmed outbreak in Africa and has&#13;
attracted considerable international attention.      Nigeria is currently getting support from&#13;
development assistance bodies such as the United States Agency for International Development&#13;
(USAID), WHO, FAO, United Nations Children and Educational Fund (UNICEF) and the&#13;
United Nations (UN) through NISCAI, set up by FGN. There is international consensus as to the&#13;
necessity for granting support to Nigeria to control the epizootic, and for this purpose USAID&#13;
has pledged US$25 million, to be focused on animal health, while WHO is providing technical&#13;
assistance towards the investigation and control of infectious diseases. DFID has donated 15,000&#13;
sets of personnel protective wear and has pledged further support through WHO. UNICEF has&#13;
also pledged technical assistance towards communication and behavioral change, with other&#13;
pledges from UN, the European Union (EU), the Japanese International Cooperation Agency&#13;
(JICA) and the bilateral assistance agency of France. The Government will review donor&#13;
contributions in consultation with the Bank and other development partners to eliminate the issue&#13;
of duplication of effort, and to facilitate fast-track disbursement, in line with an emergency&#13;
operation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                            2. Response Gaps and Bank's Assistance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
30.     There is an urgent need for further strengthening of the capacity of the agricultural and&#13;
health sectors for the effective execution of national disease prevention and control strategies.&#13;
As indicated, Nigeria is ill-prepared to contain the spread of the HPAI H5N1 and will need&#13;
considerable support. Laboratory capacity for HPAI diagnosis is very weak and NVRI and&#13;
Public Health laboratories have only limited capacity to identify the H5N1 virus strain.&#13;
Quarantine services are also weak, so that with the ongoing blanket ban on importation of&#13;
poultry and poultry products, the extent to which the import ban can be enforced is doubtful,&#13;
creating risks not only for Nigeria but for the entire region.&#13;
&#13;
31.     Specifically, assistance will be required to implement the four components (animal&#13;
health, human health, social mobilization, and implementation support for monitoring and&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
evaluation) identified in this proposal. If control measures are not undertaken, the disease will&#13;
become endemic with continuous flare-ups, causing prolonged economic losses and threatening&#13;
the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of poor livestock farmers, jeopardizing smallholder&#13;
entrepreneurship and commercial poultry production, and seriously impeding regional and&#13;
international trade and market opportunities. The rural poor who rely for a large share of their&#13;
income on poultry will be hit the hardest by loss of income and social distress.           In the&#13;
background hovers the threat of a potential pandemic and its unimaginable global consequences.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       3. Bank Justification&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
32.     A key justification for Bank involvement is the Global Public Goods aspect of controlling&#13;
HPAI - one of many emerging and re-emerging transboundary zoonoses. There is also the&#13;
national Public Goods' perspective for countries to strengthen their VS, disease surveillance, and&#13;
human health systems, as planned in this operation. HPAI control programs require a multi-&#13;
disciplinary approach to integrate technical, social, economic, political, policy, and regulatory&#13;
issues in addressing a complex problem. While the Bank's main comparative advantage vis-a-&#13;
vis its partner agencies, e.g., FGN, WHO, FA0 and OIE, is its ability to provide significant&#13;
funds to countries at risk, it is also well placed to draw on its knowledge base concerning multi-&#13;
disciplinary approaches needed in the proposed operation and to apply the evidence and lessons&#13;
learned in various regions during emergency preparedness responses. The Bank can be helpful&#13;
in bringing together the relevant ministries, government agencies and the donor community, and&#13;
in helping ensure high level political coordination.&#13;
&#13;
33.     The proposed Project is in line with the Avian Influenza Agriculture and Health&#13;
Strategies developed by the Government of Nigeria and supports the public health response&#13;
strategies outlined by the Ministry of Health, with support from WHO, United States Center for&#13;
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Bank and bilateral agencies. The Bank has&#13;
been working with FGN, WHO, FAO, OIE, EU, bilateral agencies and other partners at the&#13;
country and international levels to prepare its National Avian Influenza Contingency Plan. The&#13;
GPAI, which has been accepted and endorsed by development partners globally, has been used&#13;
in the preparation of Nigerian A1 emergency operation. The Bank can assist the Government in&#13;
leveraging additional resources from other bilateral and international agencies. In addition, the&#13;
technical assistance provided by the Bank has been important in similar global or regional&#13;
emergency situations, such as, Severely Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), post-disaster&#13;
reconstruction, and HIVIAcquired Immuno-deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).              The Bank has a&#13;
proven comparative advantage in providing integrator skills and multi-sectoral perspectives and&#13;
in addressing the institutional dimensions of the response to such emergencies. It can also&#13;
contribute extensive experience and skills in understanding and addressing the social and&#13;
economic impact.&#13;
&#13;
34.     The proposed Project contributes to higher-level priorities identified by the NEEDS,&#13;
SEEDS and to the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) approved by the Bank in June 2005. The&#13;
NEEDS emphasizes the importance of empowering people through investment in health,&#13;
education, environment stewardship and integrated rural development.          The CPS, likewise,&#13;
emphasizes the critical importance of health improved service delivery for human development,&#13;
and improved agricultural production for improved environment and services for non-oil growth.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project will also put in place the institutional capacity to mitigate massive poultry losses to&#13;
HPAI and minimize its impact to the agricultural economy, and to the rural poor by means of&#13;
compensation for poultry lost to HPAI.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       4. Lessons Learned&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
35.     Relevant lessons for the design of the proposed operation have been drawn from previous&#13;
and ongoing projects in the rural and health sectors in Nigeria. They have also been drawn from&#13;
the design of previous World BankIInternational Development Agency (IDA) projects in other&#13;
countries. Lessons drawn from the Kyrgyz case point to the following: (i) emergency projects&#13;
should avoid policy conditionality; (ii) project design must be simple and take into account a&#13;
realistic assessment of the existing governmental and other stakeholders' capacity; (iii) speedy&#13;
appraisal and approval are crucial to provide a prompt response and a substantial contribution to&#13;
project success; (iv) procurement arrangements need to be flexible and should be finalized at an&#13;
early stage; (v) mitigation and prevention measures should be included in project design to&#13;
minimize impacts of a possible recurrence of the disaster; and (vi) realistic assessments should&#13;
be made of counterparts' absorption capacity as well as of the communication and coordination&#13;
mechanisms among all relevant stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
36.     Although the Vietnam Avian Influenza Emergency Recovery Project has been effective&#13;
for only a little more than one year, the main recommendations arising from its implementation&#13;
are the following:&#13;
&#13;
        Preparedness is a key factor. There was a national strategy document on controlling&#13;
        avian influenza in the poultry population, but it was not clearly understood and shared by&#13;
        all relevant agencies and stakeholders, and some aspects of the response have been&#13;
        lagging behind.&#13;
&#13;
        A two-pronged strategy is recommended. This should include: (i) the control of avian&#13;
        influenza at the source in high-risk regions (through aggressive measures including&#13;
        stamping out, movement control and vaccination campaigns for poultry); and (ii)&#13;
        simultaneously prepared short and medium term measures to minimize the risks to&#13;
        humans and prepare for an eventual pandemic.&#13;
&#13;
        For implementation arrangements, it is important to have a coordination structure which&#13;
        is empowered with multi- and cross-sectoral responsibilities, for instance, at the level of&#13;
        the President's Office, and to have full-time project coordinators to implement activities&#13;
        in a "crisis situation".&#13;
&#13;
        An effective and credible "compensation framework" is essential to obtain real&#13;
        cooperation from affected stakeholders (farmers/producers) and to ensure the efficacy of&#13;
        the surveillance and diagnosis mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
        The importance of strengthening the technical, scientific and operational capacity of the&#13;
        relevant participating agencies should not be overlooked.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        There is an urgent need to organize an effective national response involving all technical&#13;
        divisions of the Ministries of Agriculture and Health as well as other relevant sectors at&#13;
        the national and sub-national levels in case of a human epidemic.&#13;
&#13;
        It is important to raise awareness in the public and private sectors from the initial&#13;
        moments and to strengthen effective coordination mechanisms for the implementation of&#13;
        the necessary technical responses, involving FGN, donor community, private sector and&#13;
        civil society.&#13;
&#13;
        Attention should be given to support the integration of each country into a regional and&#13;
        global framework for the control of HPAI, and more broadly of all trans-boundary animal&#13;
        diseases and other emerging infectious diseases, so as to increase cost-effectiveness and&#13;
        ensure the harmonization of activities and responses.&#13;
&#13;
37.     Some important lessons learned from the response to the HIVIAIDS epidemic have also&#13;
guided the design of the GPAI program and of the proposed Project.          ' They include:&#13;
&#13;
        The need for high-level political commitment and leadership is key;&#13;
        A comprehensive multi-sectoral approach is needed;&#13;
        Monitoring and evaluation is critical in the scaling-up of a national response;&#13;
        Stakeholders at the country and international levels are important in dealing with the A1&#13;
        threat;&#13;
        Building a strong fiduciary architecture is needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                            C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                      1. Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
38.     The proposed Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response&#13;
Project (AICP) will support the efforts of FGN to minimize the threat posed by H5N1 to humans&#13;
and the poultry industry, and prepare the necessary control measures to respond to a possible&#13;
influenza pandemic. The Project will also assist in preventing further spread of the HPAI to&#13;
other parts of Nigeria not yet infected by the virus. To achieve these objectives, the Project will&#13;
support three sets of interventions: (i) response and containment; (ii) control and prevention; and&#13;
(iii) preparedness and planning.&#13;
&#13;
39.      The Project has four components: (i) animal health - support for a national program to&#13;
develop and implement H5N1 containment, control, prevention, and eradication activities in the&#13;
livestock sector, specific to the needs of FGN in the short- and long-term; (ii) human health -&#13;
support for a national program to implement HPAI prevention, preparedness and planning,&#13;

    Evaluation of the World Bank's Assistance for HIVIAIDS Control. Washington, D.C.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
response and containment activities in the human health sector, specific to the needs of FGN in&#13;
the short-, medium-, and long-term; (iii) social mobilization and strategic communication&#13;
awareness and information - promotion of community education, public awareness, participation&#13;
and improved coordination and the execution of the contingency plans and the national HPAI&#13;
strategy; and (iv) implementation support, monitoring and evaluation. In the event of a declared&#13;
influenza pandemic, the Project will finance emergency imports identified as necessary under a&#13;
well-defined preparedness and response program to be prepared as part of project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
40.    The overall development objective is to minimize the threat posed to the poultry industry&#13;
and humans by HPAI infection and other zoonoses and to prepare for, control and respond to&#13;
influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans. To achieve this,&#13;
support will be provided in three main areas: (i) response and containment, (ii) control and&#13;
prevention and (iii) preparedness and planning. Key indicators of project outcome will include&#13;
evidence of improved effectiveness of Government in responding to the risk of an HPAI&#13;
outbreak and/or pandemic and contained and diminishing pattern of HPAI infection in poultry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    2. Project Components&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
41.    In both the human health and animal health fields, short- and long-term actions need to be&#13;
taken and an appropriate balance struck between the two. Immediate action is needed in a&#13;
number of areas, but there is also a long-term agenda, given systemic shortcomings with respect&#13;
to VS and core public health functions. Work on both the short- and long-term fronts, therefore,&#13;
needs to proceed in parallel, and efforts will be made to ensure that short-term responses are&#13;
consistent with and contribute to proposed long-term interventions. Setting priorities in both&#13;
cases is essential. By concentrating the efforts on these, dual-use investments will generate&#13;
benefits during normal times and in a pandemic.&#13;
&#13;
Component 1: Animal Health (US$29.20 million)&#13;
&#13;
42.    This component will support national prevention and control strategies proposed to cover&#13;
the country's needs over the short, medium and long term, based on detailed assessments of the&#13;
avian influenza epidemiological status, the capacity of national VS to cope with HPAI epidemic&#13;
and the vulnerability of the poultry industry to new emerging infectious diseases.          HPAI&#13;
outbreaks must be addressed at source (i.e., on the animal side), as the threat to human health&#13;
will persist as long as the problem persists in livestock and poultry flocks. It is, therefore,&#13;
important that the primary focus of attention in the prevention of the introduction and&#13;
perpetuation of the virus in the country is initiated from the animal health perspective.&#13;
&#13;
(a) Strengthening HPAI Control Programs and Outbreak ContainmentPlans&#13;
&#13;
43.    The subcomponent will provide support for the implementation of HPAI control and&#13;
eradication measures.    These measures included in HPAI Control Programs or Emergency&#13;
Outbreaks Containment Plans are intended as a rapid mobilization to respond quickly and&#13;
effectively to HPAI outbreaks during the project lifespan. The following activities are planned:&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
             Targeting virus elimination at the source: HPAI control strategies and programs&#13;
             will include the principle of targeting the disease at source of infection:        (a)&#13;
             stamping out of infected and at-risk poultry (stamping out); (b) compensation to&#13;
             farmers and producing companies at a reasonable market-oriented price; (c)&#13;
             disposal of carcasses and potentially infective materials in a bio-secure and&#13;
             environmentally acceptable manner; (d) enhanced bio-security at poultry farms and&#13;
             associated premises, through bio-containment and bio-exclusion; and (e) control of&#13;
             movement of birds and products that may be infected, including controls at the&#13;
             interface of infectedlnon-infected areas and border controls.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      (ii)   Vaccination campaigns:      This activity will support the vaccination of poultry.&#13;
             Ring vaccination will be employed around newly infected, depopulated hotspot&#13;
             areas, in parallel with stamping out and targeted, strategic field surveillance and&#13;
             epidemiological studies to identify virus sources, selection of priority hot spots,&#13;
             imposition of transport bans, and post-vaccination monitoring. A DIVA vaccine,&#13;
             using a strain different from H5N1, will be used to allow laboratory differentiation&#13;
             between vaccinated and infected poultry, especially during post-vaccination&#13;
             serological monitoring. The use of non-vaccinated sentinel domestic ducks and&#13;
             chickens is essential to monitor vaccinated domestic poultry flocks. The activity&#13;
             will also provide capacity building in vaccine quality control at the national level to&#13;
             ensure that the vaccines used conform with OIE standards. The adoption of a&#13;
             poultry vaccination policy for HPAI is still being considered by FGN, in the&#13;
             context of local poultry production systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      (iii)  Biosafety for at-risk stakeholders: Due to the highly pathogenic nature of the A1&#13;
             virus to humans, particularly the Asian H5N1 strain, training of people in contact&#13;
             with live virus will be supported. Adequate resources will be allocated for training&#13;
             and equipment (bio-safety hoods and appropriate personal protective clothing) for&#13;
             laboratory workers, poultry farm workers and poultry vaccinators.&#13;
&#13;
(b) Strengthening Disease Surveillance, Diagnostic Capacity and Applied Research&#13;
&#13;
44.    As part of the control strategy for a HPAI infected countries like Nigeria, the proposed&#13;
subcomponent will support activities to strengthen national VS, including the private and related&#13;
sectors operating under its authority, enhance animal disease surveillance, diagnostic and PAI-&#13;
dedicated research capabilities. The subcomponent will consist of the following activities:&#13;
&#13;
      (i)   Strengthening of veterinary services:    Based on the evaluation of VS and related&#13;
            services, support will be provided to strengthen national VS to bring them in line&#13;
            with OIE standards. This would be a gradual process and, under the aegis of project&#13;
            objectives, would prioritize HPAI control-dedicated strengthening.&#13;
&#13;
      (ii)  Strengthening animal disease surveillance and epidemiological analysis:            The&#13;
            activity will support:   (a) shifting from passive to active, targeted surveillance,&#13;
            supported by sound epidemiological principles, (b) improving animal health&#13;
            information flow among relevant agencies; (c) early detection and timely reporting&#13;
            and follow-up of suspected or positive cases; (d) public and community-based&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
             surveillance networks by establishing a community-based early warning system,&#13;
             utilizing existing human health infrastructures at the village level,; and (e) routine&#13;
             serological surveys and epidemio-surveillance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     (iii)   Upgrading diagnostic capacity: The activity will support the upgrading of the&#13;
             laboratories earmarked to carry out diagnostics for HPAI.        The NVRI will be&#13;
             upgraded to contain a BSL-3 facility and will be expected to carry out virus isolation&#13;
             and identification and any other isolate characterization, while the VTHs at Ibadan,&#13;
             Maiduguri, Nsukka, Sokoto, and Zaria will be upgraded to conduct PCR and&#13;
             serological testing. An acceptable biosafe environment will be created in these&#13;
             laboratories.&#13;
&#13;
(c) Strengthening of Veterinary Quarantine Services&#13;
&#13;
45.     This subcomponent serves to upgrade the technical capacity of quarantine inspectors in&#13;
enforcing quarantine regulations, and improve inspection procedures. It contains the following&#13;
activities:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       (i)   Strengthening information transfer:     This is to ensure that disease information&#13;
             generated from quarantine inspection feeds rapidly to decision makers to allow for&#13;
             the timely banning of infected poultry and poultry products from infected countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       (ii)  Provide training in quarantine protocols, pre-entry inspections, reporting and in-&#13;
             transit clearance of livestock and poultry shipment at all land, sea and air-based&#13;
             ports of entry.&#13;
&#13;
(d) Strengthening Applied VeterinaryResearch&#13;
&#13;
46.     While a range of methodologies and tools are available to control HPAI, there aspects of&#13;
the disease that are not clearly understood. While some of these researchable issues are beyond&#13;
the scope of this Program, it is proposed that funding be provided for applied research into and&#13;
field studies dedicated to HPAI disease dynamics.&#13;
&#13;
(e) Enhancing Legal and Regulatory Frameworksfor Transboundary Disease Prevention and&#13;
     Preparedness Capability&#13;
&#13;
47.     This subcomponent supports strengthening the regulatory framework to address key&#13;
policy issues to ensure that the recommended disease control, prevention and eradication&#13;
measures are implemented in a uniform and effective way and in accordance with OIE standards&#13;
and guidelines. In addition, support will be provided to review existing regulations and policies,&#13;
will fund related policy studies and dissemination workshops and will include a focus on trans-&#13;
boundary animal diseases. Specifically, this subcomponent will support key institutional issues,&#13;
including the following activities:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       (i)   Rapid assessment of national veterinary services: The ability of Nigeria to prevent,&#13;
             detect and control an HPAI epidemic depends on the quality of its national VS. To&#13;
             be effective, national VS should operate on scientific principles and, to be effective,&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
            be technically independent from political pressures. In terms of the 7mergency&#13;
            response, this will be a medium-term activity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      (ii)  Updating the National Emergency Contingency Plan for HPAI:              Building on&#13;
            existing preparedness and action plans to prevent and control HPAI epidemics in&#13;
            domestic poultry, water fowl and wild birds, a team of national and international&#13;
            consultants will assist the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development&#13;
            (FMARD) to update the existing Emergency Contingency Plan. The Plan will be&#13;
            accompanied by operations manuals, outlining in detail the steps to be taken at all&#13;
            levels of VS.&#13;
&#13;
      (iii) Human capacity building: The activity will support participation of Veterinary and&#13;
            Livestock Services officials and project staff in regional and international&#13;
            information exchanges and dissemination on AI. Laboratory technicians will be&#13;
            trained in HPAI-dedicated diagnostic techniques, and epidemiology staff will&#13;
            receive refresher training in the epidemiological principles of active field&#13;
            surveillance and data analysis.&#13;
&#13;
(JlImprovingBio-securityinPoultryProductionand Trade&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
48.    Improved bio-security in poultry production and trade is not only an important longer-&#13;
term strategy to guard against the damaging effects of HPAI but also a complicated intervention&#13;
that requires understanding of the entire market value chain. This component will support&#13;
improved public hygiene in poultry shops and live-bird markets, biosecurity regulations for&#13;
commercial farms, and devising rural poultry sector restructuring strategies to stop rural&#13;
households from living in close proximity with poultry.&#13;
&#13;
(g) Compensation and Economic Recovery&#13;
&#13;
49.    The following three areas highlight the compensation issue:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      (i)   Establishment of a national compensation policy and national compensation fund:&#13;
            Early detection and reporting as well as rapid response depend critically on the&#13;
            incentives for poultry owners to report sick andlor dead poultry to their&#13;
            veterinarians, and adequate compensation arrangements are absolutely essential.&#13;
            The existing Animal Diseases Control Act (1988) provides for compensation&#13;
            wherever mandatory stamping-out/depopulation of diseased animalshirds takes&#13;
            place. However, appropriate guidelines for implementation have to be worked out,&#13;
            including financing, fiduciary aspects, eligibility criteria, payment arrangements,&#13;
            flow of funds, and transparency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      (ii)   Support to economically vulnerable groups: Smallholder poultry stakeholders have&#13;
            little or no access to animal health services and are therefore highly exposed to the&#13;
            consequences of an HPAI epidemic. This activity will provide support to low-&#13;
            income groups that are particularly vulnerable through activities specifically&#13;
            designed to increase small farmers' awareness, improving animal health services at&#13;
            the community level, and providing grants for additional compensation.          This&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
             includes the development of pro-poor exit strategies, including livelihood&#13;
             diversification, to benefit economically vulnerable poultry stakeholders who have&#13;
             been severely affected by HPAI.&#13;
&#13;
      (iii) Alternative livelihoods for affected stakeholders:        This activity will support&#13;
             smallholder poultry farmers in a bottom-up, demand driven and equitable manner to&#13;
             resume poultry farming or undertake a different livelihood, based on demand-driven&#13;
             proposals made by stakeholders. The Project will provide:&#13;
&#13;
              a.   advisory services that will support new investment or restocking activities in&#13;
                   project areas on request by thematic associations; and&#13;
&#13;
              b.   seed money, though a credit mechanism yet to be decided, to eligible&#13;
                   stakeholders, based on their own proposals to undertake an alternative&#13;
                   livelihood, to be approved by the Compensation Fund.&#13;
&#13;
50.    Beneficiaries of the Compensation Fund will receive technical and management&#13;
assistance from reputable service providers, to be engaged by the State Project Office in order to&#13;
equip them with the necessary skills to properly utilize the fund.   The Project will: (i) support&#13;
training and learning, knowledge sharing on good and bad practices; (ii) create and maintain a&#13;
database of service providers which will be made accessible to all participating stakeholders; (iii)&#13;
encourage the participation of service providers in the learning and experience sharing events&#13;
that will be arranged by the State Project Desk Office (SPDO); and (iv) receive training on&#13;
environmentally friendly practices for selected service providers.&#13;
&#13;
51.    Under the umbrella of the Community Thematic Association (CTA), the eligible&#13;
stakeholders will present their proposals for alternative micro-enterprises to the service providers&#13;
to evaluation and approval before receiving credit from the Fund, utilizing a credit mechanism&#13;
similar to that of the Fadama I1 Project. Suitably qualified service providers will include, in&#13;
addition to the public Agricultural Development Programs (ADPs), private enterprises, NGOs,&#13;
research and educational institutions, other public sector departments, and international agencies.&#13;
The CC at the SFDO, which coordinates the Project at the state level, will provide technical&#13;
assistance to user groups for the evaluation of proposals from service providers.&#13;
&#13;
Component2: Human Health (US$18.25million)&#13;
&#13;
52.    The human health component will support the implementation of HPAI prevention,&#13;
preparedness, response, and containment activities in the human health sector as contained in the&#13;
AIRP. The project, designed by the Rapid Response Team of the Federal Ministry of Health, in&#13;
collaboration with WHO, CDC and other bilateral partners, took into consideration government&#13;
health policy agenda. This is geared towards integration of the Avian influenza prevention and&#13;
control strategies into a wider framework of strengthening the capacity of the health sector to&#13;
effectively address infectious diseases control.&#13;
&#13;
53.    To forestall a third phase human-to-human outbreak, short-term emergency strategies&#13;
will be supported while planning for long-term interventions. Initial support will focus on&#13;
prevention and reporting of human cases through the protection of farm workers and others who&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
are in direct contact with sick birds, social mobilization and raising public awareness and&#13;
strengthening of the surveillance and laboratory capacity in the affected states. The long-term&#13;
strategy will mitigate the chances of a circulating pandemic influenza virus strain through: (i)&#13;
year-round surveillance; (ii) effective and accurate methods of diagnosis; (iii) social distance&#13;
interventions; (iv) vaccines (once they become available); (v) anti-viral drugs; and (vi)&#13;
strengthened medical services.&#13;
&#13;
(a) Enhancing Public Health Program Planning, Delivery and Coordination&#13;
&#13;
54.     Funding will be made available for: (i) coordination and management of response at&#13;
federal, state and local government authority (LGA) levels; (ii) adaptation and establishment of&#13;
appropriate Public Health legislation; (iii) identifying and addressing gaps in effective&#13;
communication structures among the levels; and (iv) strengthening the capacity for effective&#13;
planning and supervision of implementation of the response plans.&#13;
&#13;
(b) Strengthening of National Public Health Surveillance Systems&#13;
&#13;
55.     To assess risks to public health and establish early warning systems to guide protective&#13;
measures, information is needed on the extent of A1 infection in animals and humans and on&#13;
circulating viruses. National as well as regional surveillance systems must be improved urgently&#13;
in potentially affected countries. When outbreaks in animals occur, active human case detection&#13;
should be'done by a coordinated animal-public health team.&#13;
&#13;
56.     National surveillance will be strengthened through the following activities: (i) review&#13;
and assessment of the current Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) system; (ii)&#13;
strengthening and harmonizing existing IDSR to include HPAI; (iii) supporting field serological&#13;
and epidemiological surveys to increase case detection and sensitivity of the surveillance system;&#13;
(iv) strengthening existing and establishing specific laboratories on Influenza Like Illness (ILI)&#13;
in a phased approach; (v) providing technical assistance to states and LGAs; (vi) supporting&#13;
capacity building and participation in scientific meetings; (vii) supporting hospital mortality&#13;
studies; and (viii) enhancing community-based surveillance.&#13;
&#13;
57.     Current surveillance systems should be enhanced prior to the possible,start of a pandemic&#13;
to assure that the high demand for timely information that can be anticipated in a pandemic can&#13;
be met. It is also recommended to carry out active sero-surveillance of the population at risk to&#13;
complement the animal health surveillance strategy. To this end, the Project will support the&#13;
following activities.&#13;
&#13;
        Improvement of health information and telecommunication systems;&#13;
        Improvement of public health laboratory networks;&#13;
        Training;&#13;
        Studies and research in epidemiological surveillance; and&#13;
        Technical assistance.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(c) Strengthening Health System Response Capacity&#13;
&#13;
58.     Social distancing measures: The most effective measure to prevent contracting HPAI&#13;
will be to limit contact of the virus with the public. Therefore, the Project will support the&#13;
implementation of immediate term responses i.e., the classic "social distancing measures", such&#13;
as school closings, backed up by a well-designed communication strategy. For the longer term,&#13;
options with industry to improve anti-viral and vaccine capacity will need to be explored and&#13;
supported. The social distancing measures will probably be enforced on advice from health&#13;
institutions, but these will not be the enforcing agency. Financing will therefore be made&#13;
available to develop guidelines on social distancing measures (in phases) to operationalize&#13;
existing or new laws and regulations, support coordination among the Federal Ministries of&#13;
Agriculture, Health and Information and other agencies and personnel involved in pandemic&#13;
control activities.&#13;
&#13;
59.      Vaccination:   Under this activity, support will be provided for seasonal influenza&#13;
vaccination among high risk workers as a vital step to prevent an outbreak among humans. In&#13;
case of an avian influenza pandemic, when a vaccine becomes available, hnding will be made&#13;
available for implementing an influenza vaccination program that rapidly administers vaccine to&#13;
priority groups and monitors vaccine effectiveness and safety. To this end, support will be&#13;
provided for the rehabilitation, expansion, and equipment of cold chain facilities for vaccines and&#13;
other perishable medical products.       In addition, National Advance Purchase Agreements&#13;
(NAPAs) of vaccines will be considered. This measure will help operationalize a public private&#13;
partnership on influenza pandemic vaccines and achieve equitable distribution by matching&#13;
capacity with total pandemic demand.&#13;
&#13;
60.     Procurement and distribution of drugs and other supplies: The use of anti-viral drugs,&#13;
while not a panacea, will be part of the strategy to contain an avian influenza pandemic and to&#13;
reduce morbidity and mortality. Project support will be provided for the purchase, stockpiling&#13;
and distribution of anti-viral drugs and antibiotics; to determine the susceptibility of the&#13;
pandemic strain to existing influenza anti-viral drugs, and target use of available supplies; and&#13;
the adoption of measures to limit the development of anti-viral resistance and ensure that this&#13;
limited resource is used effectively.&#13;
&#13;
61.     Medical services: Assistance will be provided to the health care system for preparedness&#13;
planning to provide optimal medical care and maintain essential community services.&#13;
Strengthened clinical care capacity could be achieved through financing plans for establishing&#13;
specialized units in selected hospitals, treatment guidelines, and hospital infection control&#13;
guidelines. Also, strategies will be developed to increase hospital bed availability. A substantial&#13;
burden will fall on inpatient and outpatient health care services, and Project support will be&#13;
provided to rehabilitate and equip selected health facilities for the delivery of critical medical&#13;
services to cope with increased demand for services, develop intra-hospital infection control&#13;
measures, mobilize additional health personnel, including local and international medical non-&#13;
governmental organizations; training of health personnel, provision of drugs, vaccines, and other&#13;
medical inputs, diagnostic reagents, including kits, other operational expenses such as those&#13;
related to mobilization of health teams and salaries, and technical assistance.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Component 3: Social Mobilization and Strategic Communication (US$4.08 million)&#13;
&#13;
62.     This component is designed to promote public awareness, participation and improved&#13;
coordination in the execution of emergency contingency plans as outlined under the National&#13;
Avian Influenza Plan. The main challenges faced in fighting avian influenza relate to low risk&#13;
perception, lack of motivation and trust, and livelihood issues. These are compounded by the&#13;
lack of knowledge of avian influenza among the general public and a wide range of stakeholders,&#13;
especially the small-scale family poultry farmers. To address these constraints, the Project will&#13;
identify lines of communication, social beliefs, practices and perceptions which affect behavior&#13;
and stakeholder habits, by improving public awareness and information. The component will&#13;
support improved coordination of the execution of the national HPAI responses strategies and&#13;
plans, And information and communication activities to increase the commitment of&#13;
government, the private sector, and civil society organizations, and to raise awareness,&#13;
knowledge and understanding among the general population about the risk and potential impact&#13;
of the pandemic. Activities will include:&#13;
&#13;
(a) Information and Communication Services&#13;
&#13;
63.     Communication preparedness: Activities will include developing and testing messages&#13;
and materials to be used in the event of a pandemic or emerging infectious disease outbreak by&#13;
enhancing the dissemination of information from the national to state and local levels as well as&#13;
between the public and private sectors. Cost effective, sustainable communication activities will&#13;
be developed through multi-media channels, counseling, schools, etc. These messages will be&#13;
incorporated into avian flu-specific interventions, as well as outreach activities of involved&#13;
ministries, especially the Ministries of Health, Education, Agriculture, and Transport.&#13;
Community mobilization will take place by outreach to the general public, especially in rural&#13;
areas, the church and local community leaders. Radio messaging will play an important role in&#13;
outreach. Specifically, support will be provided for: (i) the development and distribution of&#13;
basic communication materials on influenza, influenza vaccine, anti-viral agents, and other&#13;
relevant topics; (ii) general preventive measures such as "dos" and "don'ts" for the general&#13;
public; (iii) information and guidelines for health care providers; (iv) training modules (web-&#13;
based, printed, and video); (v) presentations, slide sets, videos, and documentaries; and (vi)&#13;
symposia on surveillance, treatment and prophylaxis.&#13;
&#13;
64.     Collaboration with stakeholders: The multi-dimensional problems associated with HPAI&#13;
infection necessitate collaboration by a wide range of stakeholders, to be supported by broad-&#13;
based communication and information campaigns to improve public awareness. The major&#13;
stakeholders include various ministries (notably the members of the Inter-Ministerial&#13;
Committee), traditional and religious leaders, NGOs, civil society, private sector companies and&#13;
associations (e.g., large poultry production companies, farmers' and market women associations,&#13;
veterinarians and farmers at the grass roots level). The activity will support activities designed to&#13;
improve the effective coordination and collaboration among these stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
65.     Developing capacity building modules and rapid social and communication assessment:&#13;
This activity will support the development and implementation of training courses in&#13;
communications methodology for several cadres of information and national orientation officers,&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
extension and veterinary staff as well as health workers at the central and local levels. It will&#13;
include preparation of local programs,'preparation and dissemination of information materials,&#13;
and the provision of communications and information equipment for use at the local and central&#13;
levels as well as representatives of non-governmental and community-based organizations&#13;
involved in social mobilization activities at grassroots level. A rapid social and communication&#13;
assessment will be conducted to investigate household and individual health-related behaviors&#13;
within their complex matrix of personal, organizational, and social realities. The assessment will&#13;
explore opinions, attitudes, behavior, and motivations of affected communities, leading to&#13;
understanding of health, livelihood and other social development issues relevant in designing an&#13;
effective communication strategy.&#13;
&#13;
Component 4: Implementation Support and Monitoring &amp; Evaluation (US$ 6.89 million)&#13;
&#13;
66.     This component will support implementation costs associated with project management,&#13;
coordination and monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E).           In terms of project management and&#13;
coordination, the Project will support the provision of technical assistance for procurement,&#13;
financial management and technical assistanceltraining and coordination.         The Project will&#13;
support training in participatory monitoring and evaluation at all administrative levels,&#13;
monitoring and impact evaluation assessments.&#13;
&#13;
(a) Project Management Subcomponent&#13;
&#13;
67.     This subcomponent will support strengthening the effectiveness and quality of project&#13;
operations. The Project Management subcomponent will support new or existing institutional&#13;
entities and mechanisms at the federal, state and local levels of government for overall project&#13;
coordination and supervision and would help to strengthen the effectiveness and quality of&#13;
project operations. It will support, at the federal level, the Project Desk Office at the NFDO of&#13;
FMARD and the Project Desk Office at the HSDP I1           - which will be responsible for overall&#13;
project coordination.   At the local government level, the Project will support a Local&#13;
Government Desk (LGD) and a multi-stakeholder committee which would be responsible for,&#13;
respectively, screening and approving project activities and compensation proposals submitted&#13;
by the Community Thematic Associations (CTAs). The LGD will comprise of three officers&#13;
including an Animal Health Officer, Human Health Officer and a Community1 Monitoring and&#13;
Evaluation Officer.&#13;
&#13;
68.     Specific items and activities to be funded include equipment, vehicles, operations and&#13;
maintenance costs, and minor civil works for office rehabilitation at the national, state and local&#13;
government desks. It will finance specialized technical assistance and training at the federal,&#13;
state, and local government levels aimed at developing capacity for coordination of&#13;
implementation. Because this Project will be implemented at the grassroots level, the National&#13;
Project Desk Office will maintain regular liaison with the state level offices and through that&#13;
office with the LGD, to ensure effective reporting and backstopping.&#13;
&#13;
69.     The AICP organizational structure and the command chain (Appendix 3) should be seen&#13;
as transitory, pending the emergence of a more relevant, tested and sustainable institutional&#13;
arrangement. In the local context, the risk of rivalry between various specialists/professionalsin&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
government institutions must be avoided. As soon as is feasible, while the management structure&#13;
of Fadama I1 is being used to jumpstart the animal health component of the Project, the&#13;
FDL&amp;PCS of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture responsible for delivery of VS nationwide&#13;
should strengthen existing VS delivery structures so that it can take full charge of implementing&#13;
the animal health component.&#13;
&#13;
70.     In line with OIE's "Perfonnance, Vision and Strategy (PVS) for National Veterinary&#13;
Services", the development of an appropriate framework and technical capability strengthening&#13;
accompanied by human and financial capacity strengthening should lead to privatization of VS&#13;
and greater interaction of veterinary service providers with the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
(b) Support to National Technical Committee on Avian Influenza (NTCAI)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
71.     Under this subcomponent, the Project will support the enhancement of the current&#13;
database and policy formulation capacity of the NTCAI. The Project will finance two main&#13;
activities: (a) the establishment and operation of Avian Flu Control and Prevention data bank,&#13;
building on the past experience of the relevant research institutes and governmental agencies;&#13;
and (b) capacity building for policy and strategy formulation and implementation. The Project&#13;
will finance the investment costs (mainly equipment) for establishing the data bank, training and&#13;
international and national consultant services.&#13;
&#13;
(c) Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
72.     This subcomponent will support the development of simple, but effective M&amp;E systems&#13;
in both implementing ministries and for the Project as a whole.           It will also support the&#13;
development of an action plan for M&amp;E, training in participatory monitoring &amp; evaluation at&#13;
national, regional and local levels, and a mid-term evaluation workshop.&#13;
&#13;
73.     The Project will support training in participatory monitoring and evaluation at all&#13;
administrative levels, and measurement of performance at various project milestones, including&#13;
three main elements:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    a   Management Information System (MIS) integrating existing project M&amp;E structures of&#13;
        Project Desk Office at NFDO and HSDP 11;&#13;
    a   Impact evaluation and beneficiary assessments to enhance project implementation&#13;
        performance;&#13;
    a   Monitoring the performance of project activities, and&#13;
&#13;
    a   Environmental Management Plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                3. Project Costs and Financing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
74.     Government will utilize three World Bank financed projects to respond to the Avian&#13;
threat as follows: (a) reallocation of US$7.2 million from the on-going Fadama I1 Project - the&#13;
Development Credit Agreement (DCA) for Fadama I1 has been amended for this purpose; (b)&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
reallocation of US$5 million from the on-going HSDP I1 Project - no amendment is required in&#13;
the HSDP 11; (c) utilization of US$5O.O million from the proposed emergency operation Credit.&#13;
&#13;
75.    Government has pledged that it will waive import duties and taxes on goods and services&#13;
to be procured for the Project, using as rationale the "public goods" nature of preventing and&#13;
controlling outbreaks of avian influenza. Details of project costs and financing arrangement are&#13;
presented in Appendix 5.&#13;
&#13;
76.    At the Project post appraisal review meeting of February 23, 2006, it was pointed out that&#13;
the Bank intends to expand the financial envelope for the battle against HPAI pandemic&#13;
regionally. Under the regional program, Nigeria will be supported under a retroactive financing&#13;
mechanism since the country has already started the implementation of an HPAI project under&#13;
the GPAI. At the meeting, Nigeria indicated interest of serving as a regional hub, being the first&#13;
African country to experience infection with HPAI. The Bank pledged to support Nigeria by&#13;
providing two consultants to assist in the areas of assessment, auto-evaluation and preparation of&#13;
relevant operation manuals for HPAI in Nigeria. It was emphasized that the possibility of a&#13;
regional program with regional IDA credit based in Nigeria will not delay the ongoing A1Project&#13;
in Nigeria.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                         4. Studies and Technical Assistance Required&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
77.    The list of investigations and technical assistance required are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(i)    Assessment o fHPAI in Nigeria&#13;
&#13;
       There is the need for epizootiological investigations on the status of A1 virus, including&#13;
       the H5 and H7 strains that cause HPAI. This can be done through:&#13;
&#13;
              Serological tests (Haemaglutination Inhibition, Agar Gel Immuno-Diffusion,&#13;
              competitive Enzyme-Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay (ELISA);&#13;
              Antigen detection (Immuno-fluorescent test, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase&#13;
              Chain Reaction);&#13;
              Virus Isolation at NVRI;&#13;
              Virus characterization (Gene sequencing, detection and analysis; Haemaglutinin&#13;
              typing; Neuraminidase typing).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(ii)   Technical assistance to u-pgrade diagnostic laboratories and veterinaw clinics&#13;
&#13;
       Several laboratories have been earmarked to carry out diagnosis of HPAI in the country:&#13;
       NVRI, VTHs at Zaria, Ibadan, Maiduguri, Nsukka and Sokoto for he agroculture sector,&#13;
       and laboratories at the University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Univensty of Maiduguri, Maiduguri,&#13;
       Asokoro Hospital, Abuja and four other zonal albortories to be identified. Each of these&#13;
       should have the capacity to carry out screening direct antigen detection tests, the&#13;
       immunofluorescence test and serological tests for antibody detection. The NVRI only&#13;
       would be expected to carry out virus isolation and identification and any other isolate&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      characterisation.     The following interventions are needed to enable designated&#13;
      laboratories effectively discharge their functions:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             Upgrading the diagnostic capacity of the six designated laboratories;&#13;
&#13;
             Refurbishing NVRI facilities into an biosafe environment, to minimize risks to&#13;
             laboratory workers handling live HPAI viruses;&#13;
&#13;
             Procurement of diagnostic reagents and kits ahead of any outbreak;&#13;
&#13;
             Standardisation of tests and interpretation of results, using OIE guidelines;&#13;
&#13;
             Training of laboratory staff in diagnosis of HPAI (may require international&#13;
             cooperation)  - training should involve neighbouring countries;&#13;
&#13;
             Networking with designated laboratories in the West African sub region and other&#13;
             World reference laboratories (the OFFLU network).&#13;
&#13;
      It is also necessary to upgrade the veterinary clinics in the designated VTHs and selected&#13;
      state veterinary clinics/hospitals, to conduct sampling, sample processing and basic HPAI&#13;
      serology.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(iii) Strengthening epidernio10,picalcapability and surveillance&#13;
&#13;
             Refresher training of epidemiologists in project-supported States in surveillance&#13;
             techniques, epidemiological principles, database preparation and management;&#13;
&#13;
             Developing surveillance strategies to cover the commercial and backyard poultry&#13;
              segments;&#13;
&#13;
              Surveillance techniques and strategies in wild bird---domestic poultry interactions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(iv)  Strategic research and linkage with advanced research institutes and laboratories&#13;
&#13;
      Investigations are needed on:&#13;
              Socioeconomic aspects of A1 (knowledge, attitudes and perception                  of&#13;
              HPAVPandemic, prevention and control; social and economic impacts of HPAI on&#13;
              affected communities, risk assessment and analysis);&#13;
&#13;
              Rapid and inexpensive diagnostic methods;&#13;
&#13;
              Influence of production system on transmission of A1virus;&#13;
&#13;
              Mammalianlavian caniers of A1 virus, including those in zoological gardens and&#13;
              game reserves.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      In view of the limited experience of local research on influenza virus especially A1 virus,&#13;
      it is desirable that linkages be established with advanced research institutes and&#13;
      laboratories especially regional and world reference laboratories.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(v)     Assessment ofthe spread and containment o fHPAI&#13;
&#13;
        Studies will be required on:&#13;
           a  Factors facilitating spread of A1 under local conditions;&#13;
              Effective and affordable preventive and control methods;&#13;
              Prevalence of A1 virus in different bird and mammalian species.&#13;
&#13;
(vi)    Management of Compensation Fund&#13;
&#13;
        Based on the lack of prior experience in the management of compensation funds and the&#13;
        risk of financial mismanagement, the Project will require technical assistance in the&#13;
        development and use of suitable, transparent accounting procedures.&#13;
&#13;
78.     Where practicable, consultancy services will be selected using Request for Expressions of&#13;
Interest, short-lists and Bank SWP, where required by the Bank's Guidelines. Short lists of&#13;
consultants for services estimated to cost less than $200,000 equivalent per contract may be&#13;
composed entirely of national consultants in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 2.7&#13;
through 2.8 of the Consultant Guidelines. Services for assignments that meet the requirements&#13;
set forth in the first sentence of para. 5.1 of the Consultant Guidelines may be procured using&#13;
Single-Source Selection. The recruitment of consulting services will includes hiring of Research&#13;
Institutes and Universities, and individuals from these entities, will also be contracted to carry&#13;
out various studies, data collection, and monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                         D. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                       1. Overall Project Organization and Management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
79.     Overall Proiect Organization.        The Project will be implemented under regular&#13;
government structures, including the key technical ministrieslagencies of agriculture, health and&#13;
information. The primary implementing agency for the Project will be the NISCAI through the&#13;
NTCAI (see Figures A2, A3 and A4, Appendix 4a for organizational chart and command chains&#13;
for veterinary and medical services).        Government is expected to appoint Component&#13;
Coordinators (CCs) for each sector, responsible for coordinating activities within the ongoing&#13;
Fadama I1 and HSDP I1 projects. The NISCAI or other committees established to address&#13;
emergencies will provide general policies and guidelines, in accordance with OIEIWHO&#13;
standards and guidelines. The NISCAI will comprise human health and veterinary agencies&#13;
tasked to oversee A1 control and eradication operations. It will also be responsible for reviewing&#13;
and approving annual work plans and ensure coordination and linkages across relevant agencies&#13;
and international partners.    Fully staffed project management units at all levels will be a&#13;
conditionality for project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
80.     The CCs would have demonstrated qualifications and be appointed full time. Reporting&#13;
to their respective Directors, the CCs will (i) work with staff and consultants, supporting the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
development and organization of project activities and the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) of&#13;
these activities; (ii) coordinate and oversee project activities within their respective sector,&#13;
associated institutions and other relevant government departments, to ensure effective inter-&#13;
agency collaboration including the Federal Ministry of Information; (iii) prepare Annual Work&#13;
Plans and budgets for their respective project components; and (iv) provide inputs to the&#13;
quarterly and annual progress reports and Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs). The CCs will&#13;
be assisted by staff and, where necessary, consultants who will support the planning and&#13;
implementation of activities as well as M&amp;E of project activities in both ministries.&#13;
&#13;
81.     The Bank will use the ongoing project management units in Fadama I1 and HSDP I1&#13;
projects to jump-start support to FGN, and in particular, in the area of coordination of project&#13;
activities, as well as fiduciary tasks of procurement and financial management. Care will be&#13;
taken that management capacity of neither Fadama I1 nor HSDP 11, nor this Project itself be&#13;
compromised during the transition period to full management staffing of the Project.&#13;
Management structures will be strengthened as quickly as necessary by the provision of&#13;
additional staff to facilitate overall administration, procurement, social mobilization and&#13;
communication, and financial management of the Project. Government will set up parallel&#13;
structures to under study Fadama I1 and HSDP. The government will develop a separate and&#13;
sustainable capacity at the two Project Desk Offices in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural&#13;
Development and Ministry of Health, including recruitment and training of qualified financial&#13;
management and procurement staff. An evaluation will be carried out after six months of project&#13;
implementation to assess the readiness of the two Project Desk Offices to assume full&#13;
responsibility for project implementation. Once such an assessment is made, the fiduciary&#13;
responsibilities under this Project assumed by staff of Fadama I1 and HSDP I1 will be transferred&#13;
to the new Project Desk Offices.&#13;
&#13;
82.     The Project Desk Office of the National Fadama Development Office and HSDP 11,&#13;
under the overall direction of the NISCAI, will be responsible for coordinating with relevant&#13;
government departments to guide and monitor project implementation at the central and local&#13;
levels. The relevant government department will be responsible for the preparation of annual&#13;
work programs and budgets as well as quarterly and annual project management reports. The&#13;
Program Unit will be responsible for consolidating the annual work plans and budgets for&#13;
submission to their relevant ministries and the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
83.     At the state and local government levels, implementation will be the direct responsibility&#13;
of the agriculturallhealth agencies. Small coordination units will be established at the state and&#13;
local government levels comprising officials from healthlagriculture to work under the&#13;
supervision and guidance of the National Project Desk Offices.&#13;
&#13;
84.     With respect to a11cash transfers or other forms of compensation, an adequate operational&#13;
review will be in place to confirm the validity and legitimacy of the said transfers. In addition,&#13;
the external auditors will provide an opinion on the soundness of accounting, reporting, and&#13;
internal controls in respect of cash compensation activities.&#13;
&#13;
85.     A generic Project Implementation Manual (PIM) is to be prepared prior to disbursement&#13;
to facilitate the management and implementation of the Program. The Implementation Support,&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
M&amp;E component will have two subcomponents:               (a) Monitoring subcomponent; and (b)&#13;
Evaluation subcomponent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                      2. Institutional Arrangements for Implementation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
86.     Partnership Arrangements.        Partnership arrangements for the Project have been&#13;
developed with international technical organizations (FAO, OIE, WHO, CDC) as well as with&#13;
bilateral donor agencies, building on productive collaborative arrangements developed over time&#13;
in both the agricultural and health sectors under previous projects. As noted above, project&#13;
preparation and appraisal was undertaken by a multi-agency team that included WHO and CDC&#13;
experts and also drew heavily on technical guidance available from other development partners&#13;
and OIE. Work in the country involved close consultations with local staff of the multilateral&#13;
and bilateral donors represented in Nigeria. Round tables were organized prior and during the&#13;
appraisal mission to brief these partners on the intended program of working with FGN to&#13;
strengthen its national action plan and design a country-specific project and to ascertain their&#13;
interest in providing financial andlor technical support for the Project.&#13;
&#13;
87.     FGN has already set up NISCAI and a team of experts, approved on very short notice and&#13;
will continue to receive support on the technical content of an HPAI response from WHO for&#13;
public health, and from OIE for animal health.         USAID and CDC are in the process of&#13;
developing a support program for the Nigeria. The EU has established a task force to address&#13;
HPAI and is considering the allocation of funds into the international multi-donor Trust Fund for&#13;
the Global HPAI Facility as well as direct financial support for HPAI preparedness to individual&#13;
countries, including Nigeria.     USAID has pledged to provide US$25 million in technical&#13;
assistance.&#13;
&#13;
88.     At the country level, coordination will build on existing arrangements, ensuring that these&#13;
support close collaboration between the Human and Animal Health perspectives. As part of the&#13;
Project, there is a need to support Nigeria in bringing its national VS in line with international&#13;
standards in terms of governance, organization and functioning, including promoting an active&#13;
partnership with the private sector. OIE has established an 'Animal Health Code7instituting&#13;
scientific, technical and organizational standards. Specific instruments are also available to&#13;
enable countries to carry out an internal evaluation of their own VS to verify their compliance&#13;
with these standards. Given the federal structure of Nigeria, it may be necessary to adjust the&#13;
policy and regulatory frameworks regarding HPAI to support the establishment of direct chains&#13;
of command (Figure 3A) for the following: (i) compensation policies for farmers; (ii) bio-&#13;
security levels and measures; (iii) animal movement control and quarantine (national and&#13;
transboundary); (iii) disease reporting; (iv) communication and public information; (v) humane&#13;
destruction and proper disposal of affected poultry; (vi) determining a poultry vaccination policy,&#13;
and (vii) compartmentalization and zoning (where relevant) and restructuring plans of the poultry&#13;
sector industry (where needed).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                          3. Financial Management and Procurement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
89.    Financial Management. A financial management assessment of the Fadama I1 and the&#13;
HSDP I1 had been undertaken, and were acceptable to IDA. The financial management system&#13;
is capable of supporting the implementation of the proposed Project in accordance with the&#13;
requirements of OP 10.02, except for the Compensation Fund activity for which additional&#13;
internal control and flow of funds arrangements have been prepared and will be documented in&#13;
an addendum to the existing Financial Procedures Manual (FPM) (see Figure A4 and Table A5,&#13;
Appendix 7 for funds' flow diagram and the financial management plan). The flow of funds&#13;
under this activity will only begin after appropriate internal control and fund-flow procedures,&#13;
satisfactory to IDA, have been adopted and documented in the FPM. This is a condition of&#13;
disbursementfor this activity.&#13;
&#13;
90.    Procurement. It is of crucial important that, in line with the aims and objectives of an&#13;
emergency operation, procurement be conducted in a timely, yet transparent and acceptable&#13;
manner. In the past, procurement capacity in the country's public sector was weak, as identified&#13;
in the 2000 Nigeria Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR). Since then, substantial&#13;
progress has been made both at federal and some state levels to improve the weak capacity.&#13;
Currently, an IDF grant and a subcomponent of the Economic Reforms and Governance Project&#13;
(ERGP) are supporting implementation of a five-year procurement program in line with the&#13;
recommendations of the CPAR. As a consequence, the procurement risk of doing business in&#13;
Nigeria has been assessed Moderate. The capacity of the Project Desk Office at the NFDO and&#13;
HSDP I1 to conduct procurement under Bank guidelines has been rated Satisfactory under the&#13;
ongoing Fadama I1 and HSDP I1 projects. Procurement under the Project will be undertaken in&#13;
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Bank's "Guidelines   - Procurement under IBRD&#13;
Loans and IDA Credits", dated May 2004 (the "Procurement Guidelines").             Similarly, the&#13;
selection and employment of consultants' services will be governed by the Bank's "Guidelines:&#13;
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers", dated May 2004 (the&#13;
"Consultant Guidelines"). Details on procurement arrangements are provided in Appendix 6.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   4. Retroactive Financing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
91.     To facilitate the prompt execution of key prevention and control activities, the Project&#13;
will include retroactive financing of eligible expenditures, to the amount of US$5 million for&#13;
expenses incurred after March 1, 2006. In accordance with Bank Procurement Guidelines and&#13;
the Consultant Guidelines, a Borrower may wish to proceed with the initial steps of procurement&#13;
of works, goods and services, provided that the procedures followed (including advertisement)&#13;
are in accordance with these Guidelines as well as with the credit agreement. The Bank shall&#13;
review the retroactive procedures used by the Borrower, and these would be at the Borrower's&#13;
own risk should the procedures, documentation, or proposal for award, not be in accordance with&#13;
Bank requirements and guidelines. For contracts signed prior to credit signing, reimbursement&#13;
by the Bank of eligible expenditures under the Project will be only permitted within the limits&#13;
specified in the loan agreement after effectiveness.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                              5. Environmental and Social Aspects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Environmental assessment: Environmental Category B&#13;
&#13;
92.     Environment Aspects. The Project is assessed as a Category B Project. Activities under&#13;
the proposed Project are not expected to generate any adverse environmental effects, since a&#13;
large part of the Project is geared to support preventive activities. The Project will, overall, have&#13;
positive environmental and social impacts. Nevertheless, an Environmental Management Plan&#13;
(EMP) for carcass disposal facility(ies) and a Medical Waste Management Plan must be&#13;
completed and disclosed by June 30, 2006. The scope of this EMP will be specified during the&#13;
initial period of project implementation. While the EMP is being prepared, the Project will&#13;
follow interim operating procedures to manage and monitor potential negative impacts of carcass&#13;
disposal, on the advice of a technical specialist to the Project Desks. These provisions will be&#13;
included in the Project Implementation Manual (PIM) to be prepared prior to disbursement, and&#13;
updated as necessary to reflect any modifications or additions to the procedures recommended in&#13;
the EMP.     Suitable existing satisfactory guidelines for the management of medical waste&#13;
generated in health care facilities in other projects will be adapted.       If there are no such&#13;
guidelines, a Medical Waste Management Plan (MWMP) must also be prepared and disclosed by&#13;
June 30,2006.&#13;
&#13;
93.     Worker Safety. The proposed investments in biosafe laboratory facilities, biosafety&#13;
equipment, gear, staff training and waste management will improve the effectiveness and safety&#13;
of HPAI handling and testing procedures by meeting OIE standards. These provisions will be&#13;
included in the PIM to be prepared prior to disbursement.&#13;
&#13;
94.     The Project will assist FGN in developing strategies for managing future emerging and&#13;
re-emerging zoonotic and infectious disease outbreaks. This will improve environmental and&#13;
social safeguards in two areas: (i) mainstreaming environmental safeguards into protocols and&#13;
procedures for the stamping out and disposal of animals during an outbreak in line with OIE&#13;
standards, (ii) improving bio-medical waste management systems in health facilities and&#13;
laboratories; and (iii) developing policies on compensation for poultry farmers affected by future&#13;
outbreaks.&#13;
&#13;
95.     Social Aspects. Poultry production is one of the key income generating activities and an&#13;
important livelihood for poor people. The HPAI outbreaks in Nigeria have a devastating impact&#13;
on the livelihood of poor people and other vulnerable stakeholders. The Project will take into&#13;
account these social and cultural dimensions in their community context in the fight against&#13;
HPAI. This approach, if adequately implemented, will support the strategies developed to more&#13;
efficiently manage, eradicate and control avian flu. Specifically, an understanding of local&#13;
sociocultural beliefslperception and the behavioral aspects that influence livelihoods and health&#13;
related issues will be incorporated into the avian flu control strategy. When selecting specific&#13;
project siteslstates in Nigeria, there might be possible different and particular ethnomedical&#13;
perceptions, behaviors, and ethnomedical treatments that need to be understood for effective&#13;
project development.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
96.     The Project will address other social development-related issues: (i) high-risk persons,&#13;
such as children, youths and women- involved in poultry raising and marketing; (ii) developing&#13;
strategies that include intensive education and community mobilization campaigns to change&#13;
behavior; and (iii) systematic data collection to analyze specific outcome indicators for&#13;
introducing changes as needed.&#13;
&#13;
97.     The chance of a pandemic will be reduced down everyday behavior changes, which is in&#13;
turn is determined by information and belief change, and sheer common habit. One of the&#13;
lessons learned from the HIVIAIDS epidemic is that public information alone does not&#13;
necessarily generate action. Government's role is to provide enabling policies for restoration of&#13;
public health infrastructure and preparedness at individual, community and national levels.&#13;
&#13;
98.     The Project will include an activity of small grants for NGOs and communities, in the&#13;
same manner as the HIVIAIDS local response component. For effective integrationlcoordination&#13;
and mainstreaming of the government programs aimed at communities, a rapid response system&#13;
should be put in place in the medium and longer terms to enable facilitated funding of&#13;
community-identified problems.&#13;
&#13;
99.     Since avian influenza virus recognizes no national boundaries or borders, the HPAI&#13;
strategy must address the migratory nature of wild birds that are carrying HPAI virus across&#13;
borders. In Nigeria, hundreds of millions of poor farmers and peasants live in close proximity&#13;
with their flocks and depend on poultry production for their survival, often in remote areas. This&#13;
decentralized backyard production poses enormous problems for controlling any outbreak.&#13;
Nearly all rural households in Nigeria hold 3-5 backyard poultry, used as a "walking bank" to&#13;
generate rapid cash, in case of need. Birds and eggs may be sold to neighbors or in near-by-&#13;
markets, but the bulk of backyard poultry is consumed within household and represent an&#13;
important component of the diet. Over the longer term, a strategic study is planned to develop a&#13;
pro-poor poultry sector restructuring, should such intervention be required, providing alternative&#13;
means of sustainable livelihood for smallholders. The beginnings of such a strategy may be seen&#13;
in the proposed credit for alternative livelihoods, to be implemented under the Compensation&#13;
Fund.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 6. Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
100.    M&amp;E activities will be the responsibility of the existing structure at the Project Desk&#13;
Office at the NFDO and the HSDP I1 as well as of the CCs. Depending on the specific situation&#13;
in each case, these activities could be carried out by the regular staff of the agencies (with&#13;
technical assistance) or by specialized agencieslinstitutes contracted for this purpose.&#13;
&#13;
101.    Monitoring progress in implementation and towards the achievement of objectives will&#13;
entail a process of continuous and systematic review of the various project activities. M&amp;E&#13;
activities are intended to: (i) measure input, output and outcome indicators (see Table A9,&#13;
Appendix 10); (ii) provide regular and up-to-date information on progress towards achieving the&#13;
intended results and facilitating reporting to the government and IDA; (iii) alert government&#13;
authorities and the Bank on actual or potential problems in implementation, so that adjustments&#13;
can be made; (iv) determine whether the relevant stakeholders are responding as expected; and&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(v) provide information to allow the implementing agencies to reflect and improve on their&#13;
performance.&#13;
&#13;
102.    The results of relevant M&amp;E activities will be reflected in quarterly and annual progress&#13;
reports. The progress reports will cover the implementation of activities related to civil works,&#13;
institutional activities, training and studies, performance indicators, and FMRs. They will also&#13;
cover issues identified during implementation and the strategies and actions proposed to be taken&#13;
to resolve such issues that affect progress. The fourth quarterly report of each year will be an&#13;
annual report, covering progress during the past year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                            7. LoanICredit Conditions and Covenants&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
103.     Standard requirements covering organization and staffing of program units, management&#13;
arrangements, provisions for procurement and financial management would be sufficient.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                8. Policy Exceptions and Readiness&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
104.    No policy exceptions are anticipated for the Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     E. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                1. Economic and Financial Analyses&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
105.     Analysis of Human Risk. The extent of protection achieved through the implementation&#13;
of the Project, which supports the National Action Plan, will depend on the efficacy of the&#13;
prevention, containment and treatment measures enacted. Assumed levels of efficacy of these&#13;
measures determine the range of protection scenarios. For purposes of risk analysis, protection&#13;
rates varying from 33 percent to 80 percent for both poultry and humans have been assumed.&#13;
The likely impact of an HPAI pandemic on unprotected humans was derived using WHO&#13;
estimates of human-to-human transmission: (a) 30 percent of unprotected humans are likely to&#13;
be affected, (b) one tenth of them will require hospitalization; and (c) one and a half percent of&#13;
all human infection cases will be fatal.        The same parameters were assumed for poultry&#13;
protection, although all birds exposed to the risk were assumed to perish (either from the&#13;
infection or through stamping out). The costs of implementing the National Action Plan were&#13;
assumed to remain unchanged for each scenario. The incremental benefits for each of the&#13;
different protection scenarios were evaluated for a period of 20 years, with a discount rate of 12&#13;
percent.&#13;
&#13;
106.     Major economic outcomes were modeled, based on efficacy of prevention methods,&#13;
efficacy of containment and treatment, and protection rates (summarized in Table A8, Appendix&#13;
9). The scenario of 80 percent protection results in an estimated 468,000 human lives saved and&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3,120,000 hospitalizations averted. At the lowest end, the protection rate of 33 percent still saves&#13;
193,050 lives and reduces the number of hospitalizations to 1,287,000.&#13;
&#13;
107.    While the quantification of indirect benefits is difficult, some may be equally or more&#13;
significant than those presented above.        At the current stage of the country's economic&#13;
development, many other issues are at stake. For example, an increase in human fatalities will&#13;
decrease public trust in health institutions and VS (both public and private), thus undermining&#13;
future efforts to tackle other pressing health problems, while an effective containment and&#13;
treatment program will increase the likelihood of success of such future efforts. Heavy losses of&#13;
poultry will compromise its traditional role of initial "stepping stone" in asset accumulation and&#13;
poverty alleviation among the poorest. More broadly, rural income reductions due to total&#13;
destruction of infected and at-risk poultry will slow rural development in its broadest sense.&#13;
&#13;
108.    Most of the current growth in rural areas is driven by households "graduating" above&#13;
subsistence needs.    An outbreak of avian flu will stifle this engine of rural savings and&#13;
investments and, thus, slow the development of the rural non-farm economy. No data were&#13;
available to conduct a similar analysis on the poultry sector. These will be compiled so that an&#13;
analysis can be carried out. Similar impact analyses from Vietnam and Kenya indicate that the&#13;
direct and indirect marco-economic impact of HPAI is far greater than the actual losses suffered&#13;
by poultry stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      2. Technical Analysis&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
109.    Animal Health. Successful implementation of the Project depends on a phased multi-&#13;
disciplinary strategy based on a sound epidemiological approach to control HPAI outbreaks.&#13;
This strategy has to take into consideration the range of epizoological and epidemiological&#13;
scenarios that exist or may arise in Nigeria as well as the different poultry production systems in&#13;
the country and different levels of incidence (ranging from high incidence with variable flock&#13;
outbreaks, through low frequency disease outbreaks with partial flock immunity, to sporadic&#13;
outbreaks). A balanced combination of appropriate disease control options, tailored to the&#13;
specific characteristics and needs of Nigeria, is therefore essential for the achievement of the&#13;
project objectives.&#13;
&#13;
110.    The implementation of the Project raises important technical issues and presents&#13;
substantial challenges. Key issues include the following:&#13;
&#13;
        The capacity of the public and private veterinary services:          The Nigerian VS are&#13;
        inadequately equipped and trained to deal with HPAI and the potentially large scope,&#13;
        severity and rapid spread of outbreaks across the entire range of critical capabilities:&#13;
        surveillance and diagnostic capacity for early detection and reporting of outbreaks,&#13;
        monitoring the disease, rapid response and implementation of the required control&#13;
        measures within and around the outbreaks, and essential research to understand how the&#13;
        disease develops in a particular situation.&#13;
&#13;
        Inadequate regulatory and incentive framework: The existing Animal Diseases Control&#13;
        Act (1988) provides the framework for the implementation of the Project. However, the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
government has the power to enact regulations and guidelines for the implementation of&#13;
certain aspects such as regulations for the restriction and movement of animals within the&#13;
country and between regions during outbreaks, and guidelines for the establishment and&#13;
implementation of compensation.&#13;
&#13;
Laboratory facilities and staff capabilities: Most laboratory facilities are outdated and&#13;
severely lacking in operating costs to procure the modem equipment needed to discharge&#13;
their diagnostic responsibilities. Likewise, staff expertise needs substantial upgrading.&#13;
With the help of experts from WHO and CDC and utilizing information and guidelines&#13;
provided by WHO and OIE, the critical deficiencies have been identified and will be&#13;
addressed by the Project.&#13;
&#13;
Bio-security measures: Bio-containment measures to prevent the spread of the virus&#13;
from infected premises and bio-exclusion measures to exclude the virus from uninfected&#13;
locations are essential, but have often proven to be difficult to implement effectively.&#13;
The lack of capacity, experience and resources in implementing effective measures is one&#13;
of the main reasons for the persistence of the disease and its spread across the world.&#13;
&#13;
Epidemiological expertise:      Incorporating epidemiological and epizoological studies&#13;
linked to disease control programs, so as to generate quantitative and geo-referenced data&#13;
on infection and transmission dynamics is another key success factor. Scarce scientific&#13;
expertise limits the availability of modem methodologies and tools, and the Project will&#13;
support initiatives to address this weakness.&#13;
&#13;
Harmonized disease information systems:           The importance of harmonized disease&#13;
information systems, linked to disease surveillance and epidemiological programs, is&#13;
widely accepted. The Project will support the development and operationalization of&#13;
effective information sharing arrangements within the West Africa region, as well as the&#13;
upgrading of Nigeria capacity to participate in the World Animal Health Information&#13;
System (WAHIS) of the OIE.&#13;
&#13;
Wildllfe species and reservoirs are a source of HPAI: Some species of migratory birds&#13;
appear to have played a role in the transmission of the H5N1 virus to domestic poultry.&#13;
Nigeria is an important stop-over along the flyways of a broad range of migratory birds&#13;
and for many of them their main wintering habitats. It is very difficult to apply bio-&#13;
security measures aimed at avoiding contact between migratory and other wild birds and&#13;
domestic poultry, particularly where, as in Nigeria, free-ranging backyard poultry is&#13;
dominant.    Under these circumstances it is likely to prove very difficult, if not&#13;
impossible, to completely eradicate the HPAI virus, but the Project will place heavy&#13;
emphasis on efforts to minimize the contact between wild and domestic birds.&#13;
&#13;
Poor coordination among public agencies and weak linkages with the private sector:&#13;
Ineffective coordination among ministries and public agencies, as well as weak linkages&#13;
with the private sector, are major impediments to long-term planning for infectious&#13;
disease control.     Given the zoonotic and transboundary nature of HPAI, a well&#13;
coordinated public-private response is essential.       The Project will seek to establish&#13;
efficient coordination arrangements and mechanisms.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
111.   According to WHO, the current epidemiological situation of avian influenza corresponds&#13;
to a "Pandemic Alert Period, phase 3, with human infectionts) with a new sub-type, but no&#13;
human-to-human spread, or at most rare instances of spread by close contact." Compared with&#13;
previous influenza pandemics that have taken the world by surprise, the present situation is&#13;
markedly different for several reasons: (i) the world has been warned in advance; (ii) this&#13;
advance warning has brought an unprecedented opportunity to prepare for a pandemic and&#13;
develop ways to mitigate its effect; and (iii) the present situation has opened an important&#13;
opportunity for international intervention aimed at delaying the emergence of a pandemic virus&#13;
or forestalling its international spread.&#13;
&#13;
112.   A critical element of pre-pandemic planning is ensuring that the building blocks are in&#13;
place ahead of an actual pandemic threat. The two major strategies to be supported under the&#13;
GPAI are technically sound. They focus on:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      (i)    containment measures to prevent transmission and spread of the virus through social&#13;
             distancing measures, judicious use of anti-viral medication, and strengthening of&#13;
             surveillance and public health laboratory systems.       The above measures are to&#13;
             ensure that capacity and capability are in place to allow early detection of virus sub-&#13;
             types and rapid and accurate identification of emerging virus sub-types; and&#13;
&#13;
        i)   maintenance of essential medical services and mobilization of international&#13;
             emergency health care and staffing for low-income and low-capacity situations, if&#13;
             there is an explosive spread of the virus within the general population and&#13;
             containment is no longer possible, coupled with preparedness for pandemic&#13;
             vaccination development and administration. In addition, support is considered for&#13;
             ensuring that appropriate decision making bodies are in place and have the necessary&#13;
             expertise and authority to make decisions quickly and effectively in the face of&#13;
             rapidly developing situations.&#13;
&#13;
113.   The Project will support short and longer term actions in the public health field, while&#13;
ensuring that an appropriate balance is stmck between the two. The Project is fully consistent&#13;
with WHO'S recommendations.           The aim of the proposed interventions is to minimize the&#13;
morbidity and mortality associated with a pandemic event.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                       3. Critical Risks and Possible Controversial Aspects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
114.   For the various risks that were identified, their ratings and suggested mitigation measures&#13;
are summarized in Table A10, Appendix 9. While the overall risk was rated as substantial, the&#13;
following three risks were rated as high:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      (i)    decline in political commitment to Addressing HPAI, the threat of a global influenza&#13;
             pandemic and other infectious diseases as national priority;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      (ii)   inadequate laboratory capacity for prompt diagnosis and surveillance and of&#13;
             sufficient quantities of drugs and other medical inputs needed to address the needs&#13;
&#13;
            'of the general population during a pandemic; and&#13;
&#13;
      (iii)  risk of rivalry between various specialists/professionals in government institutions&#13;
             especially where the definition of institutional roles is fluid and/or functions overlap.&#13;
&#13;
115.    To avert or mitigate the above risks will involve continuing support for inter-sectoral&#13;
collaboration through information exchanges and dialogue and operationalization of the NISCAI&#13;
which provides the general policy and guidance for A1 control. In the short term and given the&#13;
emergency and threat posed by the outbreak of HPAI in the country, streamlining the activities&#13;
of participating public agencies is not likely to be a priority. However, in the medium to long&#13;
run, the Project should strive to use relevant and tested institutional structures for service&#13;
delivery.&#13;
&#13;
116.    The Project will place strong emphasis on disclosure and transparency and on&#13;
strengthened complaint handling mechanism coupled with specific remedial measures.                  A&#13;
summary of measures is provided below in the context of fiduciary risk mitigation.                The&#13;
corollary benefits regarding good governance are self-evident. The following measures are&#13;
incorporated in project design to minimize the possible misuse of funds:&#13;
&#13;
       Ex-ante controls: Appropriate ex-ante internal controls in the poultry stamping out and&#13;
        compensation program (outlined in Appendix 7a) will be implemented before any&#13;
        disbursement of IDA resources for the Compensation Fund, and ex-ante checks will be&#13;
        carried out before and compensation payments are made.&#13;
&#13;
       Annual operational reviews:        To supplement the annual project audit, an annual&#13;
       operational review will be carried out by external reviewers, acceptable to IDA, who will&#13;
       review the internal control framework and procedures, especially for the Compensation&#13;
       Fund, and the inventories of drugs, vaccines, medical and veterinary equipment, and&#13;
        other sensitive andlor expensive assets.&#13;
&#13;
       Prior review of procurement: Project procurement will be subject to prior-review in&#13;
        accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines and with thresholds level indicated in&#13;
        Appendix 6.&#13;
&#13;
        Complaints mechanisms: A strengthened complaint handling mechanism, especially for&#13;
       the Compensation Fund, will be put in place to handle complaints regarding alleged&#13;
       misuse of funds.&#13;
&#13;
        Transparency andpublic information: Information about project activities will be&#13;
       continually posted on a project website.&#13;
&#13;
       Intensive supervision by IDA: The Project, including procurement and financial&#13;
       management activities, will be intensively supervised by Bank staff in the Country Office&#13;
       and by periodic supervision missions.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
117.    The Project will support the implementation of immediate actions to prevent, control and&#13;
respond to a possible influenza pandemic. Some of the typical and necessary "social distancing&#13;
measures"   -  such as quarantines, bans on mass gatherings, and travel restrictions    -  may be&#13;
politically and socially controversial. Intensive and continuous dialogue and compromises are&#13;
needed, therefore, among the different stakeholders, backed by a well-designed communication&#13;
strategy. A high degree of political commitment to preventing and controlling the spread of&#13;
infectious diseases such as an influenza pandemic will be needed for managing controversies that&#13;
will undoubtedly arise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                            F. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        1. Project Benefits&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
118.    A detailed economic analysis (summarized in Table A8, Appendix 9) for different&#13;
protection scenarios shows that at 33 percent efficacy, 193,050 lives are saved and the number of&#13;
hospitalizations averted is estimated at 1,287,000. If however, efficacy of protection were to&#13;
attain 80 percent, then 468,000 human lives would have been saved and 3,120,000&#13;
hospitalizations averted. At the current stage of the country's economic development, many&#13;
other issues are at stake. For example, an increase in human fatalities will decrease public trust&#13;
in health institutions and VS (both public and private), thus undermining future efforts to control&#13;
other pressing health problems, while an effective containment and treatment program will&#13;
increase the likelihood of success of such future efforts.&#13;
&#13;
119.    Heavy losses of poultry will compromise its traditional role of initial "stepping stone" in&#13;
asset accumulation and poverty alleviation among the poorest. More broadly, rural income&#13;
reductions due to total destruction of infected and at-risk poultry will slow rural development in&#13;
its broadest sense.     Most of the current growth in rural areas is driven by households&#13;
"graduating" above subsistence needs. An outbreak of avian flu will stifle this engine of rural&#13;
savings and investments and, thus, slow the development of the rural non-farm economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         2. Project Risks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
120.    The project overall risk rating can be regarded as Substantial as indicated in Section 3,&#13;
Critical Risks.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                G. AGREED ACTION PLAN&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
121.   The following plans will be prepared and disclosed by June 30, 2006:&#13;
                   Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for carcass disposal;&#13;
                   Medical Waste Management Plan (MWMP).&#13;
&#13;
       The following documents would be prepared before disbursement:&#13;
                   Compensation Manual;&#13;
                   Project Implementation Manual (PIM);&#13;
                   Annual Work Plan for the First Year.&#13;
&#13;
122.   Readiness for Implementation. FGN has commenced the implementation of aspects of&#13;
the Project, especially the stamping out and containment of infected flocks. Other aspects of the&#13;
Project are being put on hold pending final approval of the Project and release of credit funds.&#13;
&#13;
123.   Proiect Review. The Project will be reviewed annually to ensure that it is being executed&#13;
as planned, to learn from experience gained and effect necessary adjustments for proper&#13;
implementation and successful completion of the Project.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                     Appendix 1: International and Country Background&#13;
&#13;
    FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA: Nigeria Avian Influenza Emergency Control&#13;
                               Preparedness and Response Project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
International Background&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.      The continuing outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), which began in&#13;
late 2003 in several Southeast Asian countries and have occurred more recently in Eastern and&#13;
Central Europe, have been disastrous to the poultry industry in these regions and have raised&#13;
serious global public health concerns. Recent increases in the number of known cases of avian&#13;
influenza (AI) transmission have raised concerns over the potential emergence of a human&#13;
pandemic, which could have devastating effects on human health and livelihoods. At the same&#13;
time, it is important to emphasize that there are many uncertainties about whether and when a&#13;
human pandemic might occur as well as about its potential impact. Humans are highly sensitive&#13;
to the Asian H5N1 strain (high mortality rates), but not very susceptible to the disease. To date,&#13;
over 150 million domestic poultry have either died or have been destroyed and 130 people have&#13;
contracted the infection, of which at least 79 have died. The rapid geographical spread of HPAI,&#13;
the human dimension, and the potential enormous social and economic impact are&#13;
unprecedented. Economic losses to the Asian poultry sector alone are already estimated at&#13;
around $10 billion.&#13;
&#13;
2.      The avian influenza epidemic is being spread through a number of channels, including&#13;
poor bio-security in poultry farms, movement of poultry and poultry products, the live bird&#13;
market trade, and illegal and legal trade in wild birds. There is also growing evidence that the&#13;
virus may be carried over long distances along the migratory. bird flyways to previously&#13;
unaffected regions. The major flyways of migratory birds are depicted in Figure A1 below,&#13;
while the identified wetlands (i.e., possible resting sites of migratory birds) in Nigeria are shown&#13;
in Figure 3 of the report, item no. 8 listed in Appendix 11: Documents in the Project File.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Despite the control measures, the disease continues to spread, causing further economic&#13;
losses and threatening the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of poor livestock farmers,&#13;
jeopardizing smallholder entrepreneurship and commercial poultry production, and seriously&#13;
impeding regional and international trade and market opportunities. The rural poor, who rely for&#13;
a larger share of their income on poultry, have been particularly hard hit with income losses.&#13;
&#13;
4.      On the human health side, international and national surveillance is clearly vital in&#13;
preventing the spread of diseases. Besides the lack of effective surveillance systems, like in&#13;
many developing countries, the public health systems are also inadequately prepared to cope&#13;
with outbreaks of epidemiological diseases. This is due to weaknesses in public health policies&#13;
and poor coordination and cooperation among relevant institutions, both at the national level and&#13;
within countries. Lack of financing and commitment, shortage of trained health personnel and&#13;
inadequate and insufficient research and development are also additional constraints to an&#13;
effective health system response. Strengthening of basic public health and infection-control&#13;
measures, such as, source containment, casemanagement, contact investigation, infection control&#13;
at health care facilities, and community containment, will greatly enhance the capacity of the&#13;
health sector to respond to a possible pandemic.&#13;

                                                                             -- _i&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.      The rapid spread of H5N1 HPAI across Southeast Asia in 2003 and 2004, which caused&#13;
high mortality in its previously unexposed, highly susceptible commercial and smallholder&#13;
poultry populations, was followed by the detection of the disease in new territories since the&#13;
summer of 2005. H5N1 from South Asian origin has moved westwards and outbreaks have been&#13;
confirmed in Croatia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, Nigeria and Egypt. The&#13;
enormous socio-economic impacts of the avian flu epidemics as well as its potential pandemic&#13;
threat require that the international community take steps to anticipate its eventuality.&#13;
&#13;
6.      An adequate response to the global A1 threat must entail collaboration between partners&#13;
across sectors, particularly animal and human health, and donorslagencies. The technically&#13;
specialized UN agencies, FA0 and WHO as well as the World Organization for Animal Health&#13;
(OIE), have taken the lead in the preparation of guidelines and the planning and execution of&#13;
response activities in the areas of animal and human health, respectively. FA0 and OIE have&#13;
drawn up, in collaboration with WHO, a Global Strategy for the Control and Prevention of&#13;
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza. The World Bank has joined the technical agencies to&#13;
provide a framework for financial assistance for planning and implementation efforts.&#13;
&#13;
7.      Several World Bank client countries, including some newly-infected countries, have&#13;
begun formulating preparedness and response plans following the above-mentioned global&#13;
influenza preparedness guidelines. The lack of operational plans, weak institutional capacities,&#13;
and limited financing are significant constraints to implementing effective responses. In order to&#13;
address some of these issues, the World Bank has joined the technical agencies to provide a&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
framework for financial assistance for planning and implementation efforts, particularly at the&#13;
country level. Part of the World Bank's value added in the effort to prevent the spread of a&#13;
pandemic influenza is to support the development of implementable programs and to provide&#13;
incremental resources to finance country projects that are compatible with the recommendations&#13;
of the above international agencies.&#13;
&#13;
Country Background&#13;
&#13;
8.      Despite losing its position as Nigeria's prime foreign exchange earner to the oil sector,&#13;
agriculture is still the single largest contributor to the well-being of the rural poor.          The&#13;
agricultural sector in Nigeria provides employment and livelihoods to the vast majority of rural&#13;
dwellers who constitute about 65 percent of the human population of over 100 million people.&#13;
Economic growth, food security, human nutrition and child survival and development, the pillars&#13;
of stable societies and the foundations of human capital development and economic&#13;
advancement, depend on a strong agricultural sector. The development and maintenance of&#13;
research and training capacity in sustainable agricultural production practices is critical to future&#13;
economic growth, social stability and human welfare, particularly when faced with global&#13;
competition. The constraints facing the agricultural sector in Nigeria are inherently complex and&#13;
there is need for staff with a wide range of skills and expertise capable of using and integrating&#13;
the contributions of many disciplines to achieve effective solutions. The most sustainable way to&#13;
help create the necessary skills and expertise will be to build human capital of the national&#13;
institutions that are charged with research and training and improve partnerships of these&#13;
institutions with the international centers and advanced research institutions.&#13;
&#13;
9.      Agriculture accounts for about 30 percent of Nigeria's GDP and livestock (14 million&#13;
cattle, 34.5 million goats, 22 million goats, 3.4 million pigs and 175 million poultry), in turn,&#13;
contribute about 13 percent to agricultural GDP. Based on Nigeria's GDP of US$50.2 billion in&#13;
2003, the country's livestock resources could be estimated to have had a value of US$2 billion&#13;
during 2003. Mixed farming systems are the predominating farming systems. Productivity is&#13;
low and the demand for meat, dairy, pork and poultry outstrips the quantities produced in&#13;
Nigeria. Poultry production in Nigeria can be classified into extensive and intensive systems.&#13;
The extensive system mainly consists of over 143 million rural free roaming poultry. The&#13;
intensive system has two major types, namely, urban backyard types with about 200 to 2000&#13;
birds, and commercial enterprises with more than 2000 birds. Productivity in these systems is&#13;
typically constrained by poor nutrition and diseases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      A. ANIMAL HEALTH&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Structure of Veterinary Services in Nigeria&#13;
&#13;
10.      In Nigeria, like in most Africa countries, a substantial part of the animal health services is&#13;
managed by the public sector. The three tiers of government, i.e., federal, state and local&#13;
government councils (LGCs), are all involved in the administration of agriculture, including&#13;
veterinary services.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11.     Federal Government. The Federal Department of Livestock and Pest Control Services&#13;
(FDLPCS) was established in 1970 from the defunct Northern Nigeria Veterinary Public Health&#13;
and the Pest Control Departments. At the federal level, government thrust is in the development&#13;
of policies and policy implementation protocols, monitoring and coordination of several&#13;
developmental programs, national diseases control, tsetse eradication and development of&#13;
relevant legislation. The Federal Department of Livestock and Pest Control Services in the&#13;
Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development is headed by a Director.                 The&#13;
Department is composed of eight divisions, each headed by a Deputy Director. Also, the&#13;
Department has field offices at state capitals for ease of collaboration with the State officials to&#13;
carry out its various functions, including the collection of data and reports.&#13;
&#13;
12.     State Governments. At the state level, Veterinary Services are headed by Directors at&#13;
the State Ministry of Agriculture or, in a few cases, the Ministry of Animal Health/Livestock and&#13;
Fisheries Resources.     The VeterinaryILivestock Services in the state have area Veterinary&#13;
Offices or, in come cases, Zonal Veterinary Officers at local government level. The existing&#13;
Animal Disease (Control) Act 10 of 1988 vests responsibility for disease control in general, on&#13;
the State Veterinary services. States are also engaged in provision of clinical services, livestock&#13;
product quality control, meat inspection, extension and development of edicts. The Federal&#13;
Department of Livestock and Pest Control Services acts only as a facilitator or catalyst in this&#13;
regard and also when interstate and international inspection, hygiene and trade of food of animal&#13;
origin, are involved.&#13;
&#13;
13.     Local Government.         Local government veterinary services participate mainly as&#13;
mobilization and extension agents and liaise closely with the State Area Veterinary Officers,&#13;
livestock farmers, traditional institutions, law enforcement agents and other stakeholders to&#13;
facilitate services delivery, disease reporting, control of livestock diseases and pests, etc. The&#13;
Local Government VeterinaryILivestock Services are usually headed by the Heads of&#13;
Agriculture Departments in most cases; the Department comprises veterinary services, poultry&#13;
development, fisheries, forestry, crop production, livestock's production divisions, etc.&#13;
&#13;
14.     The Private Sector. Government, in realization of the fact that it cannot provide&#13;
adequate services to the subsector alone, has introduced a number of measures to enable the&#13;
private sector contribute and provide services to the farmers. Such policies in the livestock&#13;
subsector include making the atmosphere conducive for the manufacture and distribution of&#13;
veterinary drugs, agro-chemicals and livestock feeds by the private sector. Government has also&#13;
increasingly encouraged private veterinary surgeons to go into private practice. At the moment,&#13;
the private veterinarians are mainly engaged in the supply and distribution of veterinary drugs&#13;
and vaccines, equipment and livestock feeds, provision of routine clinical services, herd health,&#13;
(disease control) and consultancy services. With the declining funding of the public sector and&#13;
unending decay of infrastructure and equipment, the roles of the public and private sectors in the&#13;
provision of services need to be further defined. This is one of the major issues being tackled by&#13;
the FDLPCS through the PACE Project, which has already developed a draft legal Act, "The&#13;
Veterinary Practice Act," in an attempt to streamline the functions of the two major&#13;
complementary legislation and, particularly, the proposed "Veterinary Practice Acts".&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15.     Other Important Organs.         National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI): This&#13;
institute, headed by a Director, is the national reference laboratory for the diagnosis and&#13;
investigation of livestock diseases and collaboration with international reference laboratories.&#13;
NVRI is also involved in the production of testing of vaccines for the control of animal diseases&#13;
in the country and also conducts research and training in relevant veterinary fields.&#13;
&#13;
16.     At present, Nigeria has five federal universities (ABU, Ibadan, Nsukka, Maiduguri and&#13;
Sokoto) with fully developed faculties of Veterinary Medicine and Veterinary Teaching&#13;
Hospitals. These institutions provide training at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels to&#13;
veterinarians and conduct research in all areas of veterinary medicine. In addition, colleges of&#13;
veterinary medicine were recently established in the three federal universities of agriculture&#13;
(Makurdi, Abeokuta, and Umudike). There are also three institutions that provide training for&#13;
sub-professional and technical personnel in various livestock related fields located in Kaduna,&#13;
Vom, and Ibadan.&#13;
&#13;
17.     Veterinary Council of Nigeria (VCN): VCN is an important arm of government that is&#13;
responsible for the determination of the standards of knowledge and skills to be attained by&#13;
persons seeking to be registered as veterinary surgeons in Nigeria; maintaining a register of&#13;
veterinary surgeons; and maintaining standards of discipline and professional conduct within the&#13;
veterinary profession in Nigeria. Of recent, the VCN has established the College of Veterinary&#13;
Surgeons (CVSN), aimed at setting the grounds for continuous professional development for&#13;
veterinary surgeons for the purpose of uplifting professional standards and exposing practicing&#13;
veterinarians to current developments in the science and practice of veterinary medicine.&#13;
&#13;
18.     Nigerian Veterinary Medical Association (NVMA): Membership of NVMA is drawn&#13;
fiom all registered veterinary surgeons practicing in the country. Although the primary duties of&#13;
the Association, as for all professional associations, is the protection of members' interests, the&#13;
NVMA works in close collaboration with the Federal and State Departments of&#13;
VeterinaryILivestock Services, the VCN, NVRI, the Universities, VTHS, NGOs and other&#13;
Stakeholders to facilitate the operations of veterinary services in the country and to create&#13;
awareness on the activities and services of the profession among the public. It also represents&#13;
the veterinary profession in matters of legitimate interest, enactment and enforcement of laws&#13;
and promotion of the education, science and art of Veterinary Medicine and Public Health.&#13;
&#13;
19.     Legislations. The need to protect the animal and human health demands that veterinary&#13;
practice, the use of drugs, vaccines and ago-chemicals as well as meat hygiene should be&#13;
regulated through legislation.    The need to enforce these legislations also demands that&#13;
regulatory bodies should be put in place. Most of the legislations regulating veterinary practice&#13;
and animal health are outdated and need to be reviewed in order to position the veterinary&#13;
profession and animal health care delivery services in its proper place in the country.&#13;
&#13;
20.     The existing laws and legislations, i.e., the Animal Diseases Control Act 10 of 1988, the&#13;
States' Meat Hygiene Legislation of 1969, the Veterinary Surgeons Act of 1987, etc., are being&#13;
reviewed, while new ones, such as the proposed Veterinary Practice Act, are being developed to&#13;
address issues related to:&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      (iv) Control and sales of veterinary drugs and biological and animal health inputs;&#13;
      (v) Abattoir management and meat hygiene;&#13;
      (vi) Roles of Private and Pubic Veterinary Services, including Veterinary State Medicine;&#13;
      (vii) Enforcement of Laws, Legislations and other medico legal issues;&#13;
      (viii)Control of Veterinary Drug Residues and Mycotoxins in food of animal origin.&#13;
&#13;
21.    Future Challenges. The future presents very strong challenges on one hand and good&#13;
prospects on the other for veterinary services in this country. Globally the need for food security&#13;
by nations, with the increasing demand for livestock products, the advent of globalization of&#13;
trade and prospects for access to foreign markets in an environment of increasingly user-friendly&#13;
diagnostic aids, good quality drugs and vaccines, and an effective communications system,&#13;
present good opportunities for veterinary services and livestock production to prosper. This&#13;
must, however, be considered against the ease of spread of diseases due to ease of mass&#13;
movement of people and animals and advent of emerging and re-emerging diseases.&#13;
&#13;
22.    The issue of inadequate funding, lack of good sources of essential drugs and equipment&#13;
for veterinary clinics will continue to be of concern for veterinary services in Nigeria. The&#13;
public sector has performed creditably in the past, but it is now severely constrained. The future&#13;
direction for thepublic sector should be pointed towards the improvement of the environment for&#13;
the private sector to thrive, development of legislation, strengthening regulatory institutions,&#13;
enforcement of ethics and disease surveillance and reporting. The private sector should, on the&#13;
other hand, be geared towards provision of full clinical services and input delivery.         The&#13;
complementary functions of private practitioners in veterinary services/deliverance ought to be&#13;
recognized, encouraged and commanded. At the same time, the roles and functions of other&#13;
para-veterinary professionals must be recognized and streamlined. Collectively, we can reverse&#13;
the alarming trends in veterinary medicine by improving on technical, leadership and&#13;
entrepreneurial skills.&#13;
&#13;
23.     With the outbreaks of the avian flu, the veterinary services have been challenged. It is&#13;
now clearly apparent that there is need to examine critically the individual roles and functions of&#13;
the various actors and organizations involved in animal health care delivery service in the&#13;
country.&#13;
&#13;
Laboratory Diagnostic Capabilities&#13;
&#13;
24.     The existing laboratories that have been earmarked to carry out diagnostics of HPAl in&#13;
the country are: NVRI, VTHs at Zaria, Ibadan, Maiduguri, Nsukka and Sokoto. Each of these&#13;
laboratories should have the capacity to carry out screening direct antigen detection tests,&#13;
immunoflourescent test and serological tests for antibody detection. The NVRI will be expected&#13;
to carry out virus isolation and identification and any other isolate characterization. It is also&#13;
highly desirable for samples to be sent to the Regional and World Reference laboratories for&#13;
HPAl as part of the prescribed global laboratory networking for HPAl diagnosis and control.&#13;
Other suggested laboratory diagnostic networking should include laboratories in neighboring&#13;
countries and the West African sub-region. The prospect for Technical Cooperation Project&#13;
(TCP), to enhance HPAl diagnostic capacity, should be explored with FAO, WHO, IAE and&#13;
OIE.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Animal Carcass Disposal Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
25.     There are no rendering plants in Nigeria. Disposal of animal carcasses is done through&#13;
burial or biothermal decomposition.              Animal owners are, by law, required to inform a&#13;
veterinarian when an animal has died; the veterinarian inspects the animal and decides if further&#13;
bacteriological, virological or other tests are required. If not, the carcass is to be disposed of&#13;
either in an official animal burial ground or a biothermal disinfection facility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    B. HUMAN HEALTH CARE&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
26.     Health Outcomes. Nearly 15 percent of Nigerian children do not survive to their fifth&#13;
birthday.   The leading causes of child mortality are malaria (30%) and diarrhea (20%).&#13;
Malnutrition contributes to 52 percent of deaths of children under five. The spread of HVIAIDS&#13;
is alarming; the reported prevalence has risen to 5 percent. There are large regional inequalities&#13;
in health indicators, for example, the maternal mortality ratio varies from 339/100,000 in the&#13;
southwest of the country to 1,7161100,000 in the northeast.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
27.     Health System. All three levels of government, federal, state and local government&#13;
authorities (LGAs) have responsibilities for the provision of health care. The 36 states and 774&#13;
LGAs are responsible for all financial aspects of secondary and primary health care departments,&#13;
including personnel costs, consumables, running costs and capital investments. The Federal&#13;
Ministry of Health (MOH) is responsible for health policy formulation and for development,&#13;
financing and control of action plans for health sector development and specific programs.&#13;
MOH is also responsible for regulatory action for controlling the quality, safety and effectiveness&#13;
of health services, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28.     While MOH has a supervisory role in relation to all health-related organizations,&#13;
regardless of ownership and administrative level, it has direct managerial and financial&#13;
responsibility for only the small number of specialized health facilities, and the tertiary level&#13;
health facilities in FMOH has, in addition, direct financial responsibility for equipping tertiary&#13;
health care organizations with high-tech products and procurement and distribution of medical&#13;
supplies and equipment for priority programs. These executive functions of MOH are carried&#13;
out under oversight of the MOH's Head of Office/Executive Head, the Chief Department for&#13;
Organization of Health Delivery and Licensing, the Policy and Organizational Work Department&#13;
and the Financial and Economic Policy Department. The relative independence of the states&#13;
means that pursuing consistent national policies across the country is problematic.&#13;
&#13;
29.     Public primary health care services are funded and administered by the state MOHs,&#13;
which provide technical assistance to the LGAs. The referral system is weak and undeveloped,&#13;
with few links between the primary and secondary system.&#13;
&#13;
30.     Public financing of the social services remains low in real per capita terms at 0.3 percent&#13;
of GNP. Inadequate financial resource for the health sector ($2-$3 per capita) is a major&#13;
problem. Development and recurrent expenditure has declined, resulting in a scarcity of drugs&#13;
and medical supplies and the deterioration of facilities. The private sector is very important -&#13;
about 60 percent of health service expenditure now occurs outside of the public sector by a range&#13;
of non-profit, traditional and modem practitioners.         There is very little regulation and&#13;
standardization of services. Nationally the principal actors in the formal private sectors are for-&#13;
profit patent medicine vendors and registered pharmacies.&#13;
&#13;
31.     Surveillance and Laboratory Capacity.         The Integrated Disease Surveillance and&#13;
Response (IDSR) system was introduced in Nigeria in 1998. The aim is to strengthen the&#13;
surveillance system using an integrated approach making more efficient use of scarce resources.&#13;
Twenty one priority diseases are included into the IDSR. A recent assessment of the system in&#13;
Nigeria highlighted several challenges: low degree of completeness of reporting, poor logistics&#13;
and communication support, delays in reporting and unavailability of case definition and case&#13;
management protocols at surveillance sites.&#13;
&#13;
32.     Human virus laboratories are currently located in Ibadan, Maiduguri, Lagos and Asokoro&#13;
Hospital in Abuja. There are a number of constraints that need to be addressed to prepare these&#13;
facilities to handle human samples of H5N1:          lack of bio-safety guidelines for handling&#13;
specimens, lack of safety equipment and procedures and limited technical capacity. These&#13;
laboratories at the University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Univeristy of Maiduguri, Maiduguri, Asokoro&#13;
Hospital, Abuja and four other zonal laboratories to be identified will be upgraded.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                             Appendix 2: Country Eligibility under GPAI&#13;
&#13;
    FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA: Nigeria Avian Influenza Emergency Control&#13;
                                     Preparedness and Response Project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.       The Project comes under the GPAI approved by the Board on January 16, 2006. The&#13;
GPAI is to be provided using the horizontal Adaptable Program Loan (APL) instrument and&#13;
within a global coordination framework. Under the global APL, individual countries will obtain&#13;
separate loans, credits and grants, as they become available, to finance their own national&#13;
projects up to the global aggregate limit of US$500 million. Since the GPAI is designed to&#13;
provide emergency financing to participating countries to contain outbreaks of avian flu through&#13;
early detection and rapid response measures, the country-specific operations, such as described&#13;
for the Government of Nigeria, will be processed under the Bank's emergency policy, OP/BP&#13;
8.50. The GPAI will treat specific emergency response projects in each country as "phases" of a&#13;
horizontal APL (similar approaches include the Multi-Country HIVIAIDS Programs for the&#13;
African and the Caribbean Regions).              The country clearly meets the eligibility criteria for&#13;
"countries at risk" in GPAI category (ii) newly infected countries (see Box Al).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                    1&#13;
                            Box Al. Country Eligibility Criteria under the GPAI&#13;
&#13;
In view of the wide variation of individual countries' conditions, GPAI projects will need to reflect the&#13;
environment in which they are to be implemented. Accordingly, country requests for assistance are eligible for&#13;
financing under the GPAI when they meet the following criteria:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    (i)   Countries in endemic situation, where new human infections are being detected, will need to have&#13;
          prepared and be implementing an HPAI Control Strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    (ii)  Newly infected countries, with an active outbreak of avian influenza among poultry but no human&#13;
          infection, will need to have in place an appropriate program of rapid response, detection and&#13;
          containment measures, including implementation and monitoring arrangements that the international&#13;
          agencies and donor community, including the Bank, could support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    (iii) Countries at risk, with no outbreaks or at an early stage of an outbreak, will need to demonstrate&#13;
          governmental commitment to addressing the situation and have in place an appropriate plan for early&#13;
          detection and rapid response, including implementation and monitoring arrangements that the&#13;
          international agencies and donor community, including the Bank, could support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    (iv)  Countries with very low income levels and very low capacity will be considered against special&#13;
          criteria, and waivers will apply if a full-blown human pandemic were to materialize, to ensure that&#13;
          assistance is available if and when needed, even if the country itself will hardly be able to generate or&#13;
          mobilize any effective HPAI response.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.       However, since the proposed Project is not included in the Country Partnership Strategy&#13;
(2005-2009), financial assistance for the Project will be provided as a credit. The credit is being&#13;
processed as an Emergency Recovery Credit (ERC) under OP 8.50.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                            Appendix 3: Detailed Project Description&#13;
&#13;
    FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA: Nigeria Avian Influenza Emergency Control&#13;
                               Preparedness and Response Project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                            A.      Proposed Development Objective&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.      The proposed Nigeria Avian Influenza Emergency Control Preparedness and Response&#13;
Project will support the efforts of the federal government to minimize the threat posed by H5N1&#13;
to humans and the poultry industry, and prepare the necessary control measures to respond to a&#13;
possible influenza pandemic. The Project will also assist in preventing the further spread of the&#13;
HPAI to other parts of Nigeria not yet infected by the virus. To achieve these objectives, the&#13;
Project will support three sets of interventions: (i) response and containment; (ii) control and&#13;
prevention; and (iii) preparedness and planning.&#13;
&#13;
2.      The Project has four components: (i) Animal Health: support for a national program to&#13;
develop and implement H5N1 containment, control, prevention, and eradication activities in the&#13;
livestock sector, specific to the needs of the Government of Nigeria in the short- and long-term;&#13;
(ii) Human Health:       support for a national program to implement HPAI             prevention,&#13;
preparedness and planning, response and containment activities in the human health sector,&#13;
specific to the needs of the Government of Nigeria in the short-, medium-, and long-term; (iii)&#13;
Social Mobilization and Strategic Communication Awareness and Information: promotion of&#13;
community education, public awareness, participation and improved coordination and the&#13;
execution of the contingency plans and the national HPAI strategy; and (iv) Implementation&#13;
Support, Monitoring and Evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
3.      The proposed Project is not included in the Country Partnership Strategy (2005-2009) as&#13;
this is an Emergency Recovery Credit (ERC) being processed under OP 8.50.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B.       Country Strategies for the Prevention of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)&#13;
                                                into Nigeria&#13;
&#13;
4.      After deliberations in a meeting held at the Veterinary Council of Nigeria (VCN)&#13;
conference hall, Abuja, during December 12-14, 2005, the Technical Committee of experts on&#13;
the prevention and control of HPAI recommended the under-listed strategies for the prevention&#13;
of HPAI into the country:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       (a)    Ban on importation of poultry and poultry products from countries where the&#13;
              disease (HPAI) is known to exist. At present, there is an existing total ban on&#13;
              importation into the country of live birds and poultry products, including fertile&#13;
              eggs. This needs to be re-examined from time to time with a view to ameliorating&#13;
              the negative impact on the fragile poultry industry without compromising the&#13;
              present HPAI status in the country.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     (b)    Effective animal disease surveillance, involving high risk areas, such as, poultry&#13;
            markets, wetlands and poultry located along known migratory birds routes, poultry&#13;
            abattoirs, borders and targeted farms. Results obtained may then be used to assess&#13;
            the need for a complete nationwide HPAI active disease, virus and sero-surveillance&#13;
            to determine the epidemiological status of the disease in the country.&#13;
&#13;
     (c)    Improved and functional National Veterinary Quarantine Services (NVQS)&#13;
            including immediate rehabilitation and revitalization of existing veterinary&#13;
            quarantine infrastructure, control posts and enhanced manpower capabilities. This is&#13;
            to enable a sustained surveillance of animal diseases at the ports of entry in the&#13;
            course of animallanimal products, biologics and germplasm trade.           The NVQS&#13;
            service staff should maintain continuous presence at the ports of entry into the&#13;
            country and constitute part of the Joint Intelligence Board (JIB), which should play&#13;
            an active role in HPAI surveillance at the ports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      (d)   Targeted community-based training of rural backyard poultry farmers in various&#13;
            aspects of HPAI recognition and control, including biosecurity procedures&#13;
            applicable to rural small scale poultry enterprises and the role of animal disease&#13;
            vigilante in the control of HPAI.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      (e)   Enforcement of the requirement for import permits for poultry and poultry products&#13;
            issued by the FDLPCS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      (f)   Development of a traceability mechanism for animals and strict monitoring of&#13;
            poultry movement and poultry products through registration and licensing of poultry&#13;
            farms, hatcheries and other poultry enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      (g)   Development of a community based, participatory rural livestock and poultry&#13;
            disease surveillance system and integration into the existing epidemio-surveillance&#13;
            network.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      (h)    Training of veterinarians, auxiliaries, other categories of poultry farmers on HPAI&#13;
            prevention and control strategies, including aspects of bio-security.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      (i)    Effective public enlightenment and awareness programs on HPAI.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               C.      Contingency Manual for Avian Influenza (AI) Outbreaks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5 .    FGN has put in place a contingency manual for the control of A1 adapted fiom a&#13;
summary of the contingency manual for A1 which was prepared by the Centro Regionale per&#13;
1'Epidemiologia Veterinaria (CREV) and by the Italian National Reference Laboratory for Avian&#13;
Influenza at the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie. It is as follows:&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Access to Suspected Infected Premises&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(a) Suspicion:&#13;
&#13;
      As soon as the suspicion of A1 is reported, the official (state, federal, local government)&#13;
       veterinarian (OV) identifies the person who has reported the suspicion, and if the latter is&#13;
       a farmer, the OV collects information concerning:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           (i)    location, characteristics and number of birds and other animals on the farm;&#13;
           (ii)   presence of staff and vehicles;&#13;
           (iii)  recent movement of people, equipment, vehicles and animals;&#13;
           (iv)   availability on site of disinfectants and equipment for disinfecting premises.&#13;
&#13;
       Reporting the suspicion is also compulsory for the farmlcompany veterinarian or private&#13;
      practitioner who must support the OV in collecting information. If the suspicion is&#13;
      reported before the arrival of the OV, the company veterinarian or private practitioner&#13;
       must do everything in hislher power to prevent the infection from spreading. The vehicle&#13;
       of the OV and the companylfield veterinarian must be left outside infected premises and&#13;
       at a distance from the entrance of the farm.&#13;
&#13;
       The OV coordinates at the farm level in order to avoid movement of people, animals,&#13;
       equipment and vehicles from the suspected premises and in the meantime:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           a)    Informs the official laboratory of the suspicion of AI;&#13;
           b)    Informs the head of the local veterinary office indicating the suspicion of AI;&#13;
           c)    Provides himself with "Kit No. 1".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(b) Access:&#13;
&#13;
       Access to the premises must take place following a complete change in clothing.&#13;
       Disposal gear, including head cap and shoe covers must be worn by all staff entering the&#13;
       farm. A changing room must be identified, and it should contain large plastic bags,&#13;
       cardboard boxes, latex gloves and a sufficient quantity of disinfecting solution (see&#13;
       disinfectants below). The remaining components of kit no1 are to be used inside the&#13;
       poultry houselshed. The initial coordinate tasks of the OV are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       (i)      Put the Farm under Restriction&#13;
&#13;
                a.   Obtain written declaration from the personnel on the farm stating that they&#13;
                     will not visit any establishment containing live birds for 3 days; the OV and&#13;
                     any other veterinarian must also comply with this general rule;&#13;
&#13;
                b.   Identify locations on the farm where vehicles leaving the farm can be&#13;
                     properly washed and disinfected, and organize washing and disinfection&#13;
                     procedures;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      c.   Identify sites where staff may wash and disinfect and ensure that on leaving&#13;
           the premises all staff leave their disposable gear inside the changing room:&#13;
&#13;
            i.   Leak-proof water-resistant container;&#13;
            ii.  thermic (insulated box) container for carrying samples;&#13;
            ...&#13;
            111. two pairs of latex gloves;&#13;
            iv. five autoclavable plastic bags;&#13;
            v.   five black rubbish bags;&#13;
            vi. disinfecting solution.&#13;
&#13;
      d.     The remaining components of Kit No, 2 must be carried inside the&#13;
           houselshed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(ii)  Preliminary Investigation. The OV and the LV collect the following information:&#13;
&#13;
      a. preliminary identification of the productive unit and sub-units (topography of&#13;
         the farm) and identification of the unit for which the suspicion has been&#13;
         reported;&#13;
&#13;
      b.   identification of staff directly involved with that unit;&#13;
&#13;
      c.   anamnestic data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(iii) ClinicalInvestigation.&#13;
&#13;
      a. The aim of the clinical investigation is to establish the clinical situation on the&#13;
         farm, including ill and suspect birds.       The clinical investigation must be&#13;
         performed on all susceptible birds present on the farm, and it must begin from&#13;
         the most peripheral units. Particular attention must be paid to any vaccination&#13;
         performed. All this information must be reported in the epidemiological&#13;
         inquiry.&#13;
&#13;
      b. All the birds present per species must be identified, and for each species&#13;
         identified, a report containing the onset of clinical signs, description of&#13;
         clinical signs and reported percentage mortality must be prepared.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(iv)  Collection of Pathological Samples.        In cases of suspected A1 the following&#13;
      pathological samples must be collected and sent to the laboratory:&#13;
&#13;
      a. at least 5 moribund birds (for post mortem examination);&#13;
&#13;
      b.   pooled tracheal, lung, spleen, liver, kidney samples from at least 5 moribund&#13;
           birds;&#13;
&#13;
      c.   pooled intestine samples from at least 5 moribund birds;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
           d.   cloaca1and tracheal swabs from healthy birds (also from waterfowl and rats);&#13;
&#13;
           e.   at least 10blood samples (acute sera).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Samples from different apparatuses must not be pooled; they must be packaged&#13;
           appropriately in leak-proof containers, wrapped in at least two plastic bags to&#13;
           avoid dissemination of the infectious agents, and transported refrigerated (on ice&#13;
           packs) to the laboratory. Sacrificed animals may be transported in a sealed&#13;
           autoclavable plastic bag, inserted inside a similar, sealed bag. All samples must&#13;
           be carried to the laboratory inside a polystyrene box containing ice packs. The&#13;
           polystyrene (thermic) box must be appropriately disinfected before leaving the&#13;
           premises. The samples must be accompanied by the appropriate form.&#13;
&#13;
           The driver in charge of delivering the samples must drive directly to the&#13;
           laboratory without any intermediate stops. Samples should be sent to:&#13;
&#13;
                   The Executive Director,&#13;
                   National Veterinary Research Institute,&#13;
                   Vom,&#13;
                   Plateau State.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     (v)   Epidemiological Inquiry. The OV and LV are requested to carefully fill in the&#13;
           Epidemiological Inquiry Form. With reference to the epidemiological inquiry, it&#13;
           is important that:&#13;
&#13;
           a. animal movements: animal movements should be recorded up to 20 days&#13;
               prior to the onset of the first clinical signs;&#13;
&#13;
           b.   people movements:          all people (staff, relatives, servicing personnel,&#13;
                veterinarians) who had access to the farm must be recorded;&#13;
&#13;
           c.   vehicle movements: all vehicles, regardless of their contact with animals,&#13;
                which have had access to the farm, must be reported.&#13;
&#13;
           The epidemiological inquiry must be sent (possibly faxed) to the competent&#13;
           authorities as soon as it has been completed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(c) Exit&#13;
&#13;
     Following the clinical visit and the collection of samples, the OV and LV, in the&#13;
     designated changing room, disinfect their protective gear and collect all sterilizable&#13;
     equipment, disinfect same in appropriate concentration of disinfectant in an autoclavable&#13;
     bag which is sealed and inserted into a second bag which is disinfected externally. All&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         single used materials, sheets of paper, disposable gear, shoe covers are put inside a plastic&#13;
        bag which is left on site.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   D.     Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.       The proposed Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response&#13;
Project (AICP) will support the efforts of FGN to minimize the threat posed by H5N1 to humans&#13;
and the poultry industry, and prepare the necessary control measures to respond to a possible&#13;
influenza pandemic. The Project will also assist in preventing further spread of the HPAI to&#13;
other parts of Nigeria not yet infected by the virus. To achieve these objectives, the Project will&#13;
support three sets of interventions: (i) response and containment, (ii) control and prevention; and&#13;
(iii) preparedness and planning.&#13;
&#13;
7.      The Project has four components: (i) animal health: support for a national program to&#13;
develop and implement H5N1 containment, control, prevention, and eradication activities in the&#13;
livestock sector, specific to the needs of FGN in the short- and long-term; (ii) human health:&#13;
support for a national program to implement HPAI prevention, preparedness and planning,&#13;
response and containment activities in the human health sector, specific to the needs of FGN in&#13;
the short-, medium-, and long-term; (iii) social mobilization and strategic communication&#13;
awareness and information: promotion of community education, public awareness, participation&#13;
and improved coordination and the execution of the contingency plans and the national HPAI&#13;
strategy; and (iv) implementation support, monitoring and evaluation.                  The primary&#13;
implementation agencies for the Project will be the NISCAI through the NTCAI. It is expected&#13;
that government will appoint Component Coordinators (CCs) for each sector responsible for&#13;
coordinating activities within the National Fadama Development Project I1 (Fadama 11) and the&#13;
Health Systems Development Project (HSDP 11). In the event of a declared influenza pandemic,&#13;
the Project will finance emergency imports identified as necessary under a well-defined&#13;
preparedness and response program to be prepared as part of project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
8.       The overall development objective is to minimize the threat posed to the poultry industry&#13;
and humans by HPAI infection and other zoonoses and to prepare for, control and respond to&#13;
influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans.            To achieve this,&#13;
support will be provided in three main areas: (i) response and containment, (ii) control and&#13;
prevention and (iii) preparedness and planning. Key indicators of project outcome will include&#13;
evidence of improved effectiveness of Government in responding to the risk of an HPAI&#13;
outbreak and/or pandemic and contained and diminishing pattern of HPAI infection in poultry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    E.      Project Components&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9.       In both the public health and animal health fields, short- and long-term actions need to be&#13;
taken and an appropriate balance struck between the two. Immediate action is needed in a&#13;
number of areas, but there is also a long-term agenda given systemic shortcomings with respect&#13;
to VS and core public health functions. Work on both the short- and long-term fronts, therefore,&#13;
needs to proceed in parallel, and efforts will be made to ensure that short-term responses are&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
consistent with and contribute to proposed long-term interventions. Setting priorities in both&#13;
cases is essential. By concentrating efforts on these, dual-use investments will generate benefits&#13;
during normal times and in a pandemic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Component 1: Animal Health (US$29.20 million)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10.      This component will support national prevention and control strategies proposed to cover&#13;
the country's needs over the short, medium or long term, based on detailed assessments of the&#13;
avian influenza epidemiological status, the capacity of national VS to cope with HPAI epidemic&#13;
and the vulnerability of the poultry industry to new emerging infectious diseases. It is pertinent&#13;
to stress that HPAI outbreaks should be addressed at source (i.e., on the animal side), as the&#13;
threat to human health will persist as long as the problem persists in livestock and poultry flocks.&#13;
It is, therefore, important that the primary focus of attention in the prevention of the introduction&#13;
and perpetuation of the virus in the country is initiated from the animal health perspective.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(a)      Strengthening HPAI Control Programs and Outbreak Containment Plans&#13;
&#13;
         The subcomponent will provide support, for the implementation of HPAI control and&#13;
eradication measures. These measures included in HPAI Control Programs or Emergency&#13;
Outbreaks Containment Plans, are intended as a rapid mobilization to respond quickly and&#13;
effectively to HPAI outbreaks during the project lifespan. The subcomponent will consist of the&#13;
following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         (i)   Targeting Virus Elimination at the Source: The specific HPAI control strategies&#13;
               and programs will include the principle of targeting the disease at source of&#13;
               infection. This activity will support the following activities: (a) destruction of&#13;
               infected and at-risk poultry (stamping out); (b) compensation to farmers at a&#13;
               reasonable market-oriented price; (c) disposal of carcasses and potentially infective&#13;
               materials in a bio-secure and environmentally acceptable manner; (d) enhanced&#13;
               bio-security at poultry farms and associated premises through bio-containment and&#13;
               bio-exclusion; and (e) control of movement of birds and products that may be&#13;
               infected, including controls at the interface of infectedlnon-infected areas and&#13;
               border controls.&#13;
&#13;
         (ii)  Vaccination Campaigns: This activity will support direct vaccination of poultry.&#13;
               The use of vaccination to control HPAI must go in parallel with strategic field&#13;
               surveillance and epidemiological studies to identify virus sources, selection of&#13;
               priority hot spots, imposition of transport bans, and post-vaccination monitoring.&#13;
               Serological monitoring using the Differentiation of Infected from Vaccinated&#13;
               Animals (DIVA) principle and the use of sentinel domestic ducks and chickens are&#13;
               essential measures to monitor vaccinated domestic duck flocks. This activity will&#13;
               support the use of good quality HPAI vaccines produced according to OLE&#13;
               standards and implemented according to FAOIOIE guidelines. The activity will&#13;
               also provide capacity building in vaccine quality control at the national level to&#13;
               ensure that vaccines are used with a clearly defined objective and time-phased exit&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
             strategy, linked to      strict post-vaccination surveillance     and  monitoring.&#13;
             Nevertheless, the merits and demerits of the adoption of a vaccination policy on&#13;
             HPAI are still being considered by FGN in the context of local poultry production&#13;
             systems.&#13;
&#13;
       (iii) Human Safety Component: Due to the highly pathogenic nature of the A1 virus to&#13;
             humans, particularly the Asian H5N1 strain, training of people in contact with live&#13;
             virus will be supported. This will include field workers involved in identification&#13;
             of the disease, farm workers involved in stamping out, and laboratory workers&#13;
             involved in virus isolation and diagnosis. Adequate resources will be allocated for&#13;
             training and equipment (bio-safety hoods and appropriate personal protective&#13;
             clothing).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(b)    Strengthening Disease Surveillance, Diagnostic Capacity and Applied Research&#13;
&#13;
11.    As part of the control strategy for a HPAI infected country, like Nigeria, the proposed&#13;
subcomponent will support activities to strengthen national VS, including the private and related&#13;
sectors operating under its authority, and enhance animal disease surveillance, diagnostic and&#13;
research capabilities. The subcomponent will consist of the following activities:&#13;
&#13;
       (i)   Strengthening of Veterinary Sewices: Once the evaluation of VS and related&#13;
             services has been completed, support will be provided to strengthen national VS to&#13;
             bring them in line with OIE standards. Such support will include: (a) technical&#13;
             support for strengthening governance and updating legislation; (b) support for&#13;
             institutional and organizational restructuring and training of staff; and (c)&#13;
             upgrading of priority infrastructure (limited works, equipment, materials and&#13;
             supplies, and technical assistance). Staff training will be targeted at public and&#13;
             private veterinarians and veterinary practitioners operating in the rural areas. Its&#13;
             focus will be on awareness raising, monitoring, investigating, sampling and test&#13;
             procedures to be applied in case of an outbreak as well as on analyzing&#13;
             epidemiological data and performing risk assessments.&#13;
&#13;
       (ii)  Strengthening Animal Disease Surveillance:         The activity will support the&#13;
             following activities: (a) improving animal health information flow among relevant&#13;
             agencies; (b) detection, reporting and follow-up of reported cases; (c) public and&#13;
             community-based surveillance networks; and (d) routine serological surveys and&#13;
             epidemio-surveillance. More specifically, this activity will support the following&#13;
             activities:&#13;
&#13;
               a. Epidemiological Suweys:       To address the problem of lack of reliable&#13;
                   epidemiological information, and the sound analysis thereof, which has&#13;
                   hampered the development of rational, targeted disease control measures,&#13;
                   well-structured epidemiological studies and surveillance programs will be&#13;
                   integrated with disease control measures, which will then be adjusted and&#13;
                   improved as new information becomes available. In addition, participatory&#13;
                   methodologies, involving farmer, para-veterinarians, and community workers,&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                   will be used extensively, given the fact the major control targets are the small-&#13;
                   scale and semi-commercial poultry production systems.&#13;
&#13;
               b. Community-based Animal Disease Surveillance: A critical objective of this&#13;
                   activity will be to improve the commitment of all participants of the&#13;
                   "epidemiological surveillance networks". The activity will support training&#13;
                   for animal health workers, and treatment of infected animals and reporting&#13;
                   procedures. Farmers will receive hands-on training in detection of clinical&#13;
                   signs. The activity will also provide basic bio-security equipment, such as&#13;
                   sprayers and protective equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(c)    Strengthening of Veterinary Quarantine Services&#13;
&#13;
12.    The subcomponent will finance the establishment at the community level of early&#13;
warning and reaction systems to support a robust emergency reporting and feedback system&#13;
against notifiable diseases. It will consist of the following activities:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       (i)    Upgrading Diagnostic Capacity: The activity will support the upgrading of the&#13;
              existing laboratories that have been earmarked to carry out diagnostics of HPAI in&#13;
              the country. Each of these laboratories should have the capacity to carry out direct&#13;
              antigen detection tests, immunoflourescent tests and serological tests for antibody&#13;
              detection. The NVRI will be upgraded to a P3 facility and will be expected to&#13;
              carry out virus isolation and identification and any other isolate characterization,&#13;
              while the VTHs at Ibadan, Maiduguri, Nsukka, Sokoto, and Zaria will be upgraded&#13;
              to P2 facilities.&#13;
&#13;
       (ii)   Strengthening Human and Animal Health Surveillance System Linkages: This is to&#13;
              ensure that disease information feeds rapidly into action in both systems.&#13;
&#13;
       (iii)  Enhancing Animal Diseases Information Systems: The activity will support the&#13;
              development of a uniform disease information system in Nigeria, as part of the&#13;
              control program to provide better analytical capacity to enable the country to&#13;
              participate in global disease information sharing, complying with her obligations as&#13;
              a member of the OIE, thereby contributing towards progressively better global and&#13;
              regional control and eradication.        The system will be linked with rapid and&#13;
              standardized methods of routine analysis of surveillance data, which will&#13;
              demonstrate important changes in the H5N1 situation, and promptly supply this&#13;
              information to field personnel.&#13;
&#13;
       (iv)   Strengthening Applied Veterinary Research: While a range of methodologies and&#13;
              tools are available to control HPAI, there are a number of aspects of the diseases&#13;
              that are not clearly understood.       While some of these researchable issues are&#13;
              beyond the scope of this Program, it is proposed that funding be provided for&#13;
              studies linked with the national disease control plans.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(d)    Enhancing HPAI Prevention and Preparedness Capability&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
13.    This subcomponent will provide support to activities related to the improvement in the&#13;
regulatory framework to address key policy issues to ensure that the recommended disease&#13;
control, prevention and eradication measures are implemented in a uniform and effective way&#13;
and in accordance with OIE standards and guidelines. In addition, this subcomponent will&#13;
support reviews of existing regulations and policies, fund related policy studies and&#13;
dissemination workshops and will include a focus on trans-boundary animal diseases. More&#13;
specifically, this activity will support key diagnostic and assessment studies, including the&#13;
following activities:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       (i)    Assessment of National Veterinary Services: The ability of a country to prevent,&#13;
              detect and control an HPAI epidemic depends on the quality of its national VS. To&#13;
              be effective, national VS should operate based on scientific principles and be&#13;
              technically independent from political pressures. To meet international standards&#13;
              set by OIE, VS need to develop and document appropriate procedures and&#13;
              standards for the implementation and management of animal health measures and&#13;
              international veterinary certification activities. To assist in this effort, the OIE has&#13;
              developed instruments to assist national VS in carrying out a self-evaluation and&#13;
              establish their current level of performance, form a shared vision with the private&#13;
              sector, establish priorities, and facilitate strategic planning. In this respect, the&#13;
              audit procedure entitled, "Performance, Vision and Strategy (PVS) for National&#13;
              Veterinary Services", due to be incorporated into the standards published by OIE&#13;
              as the reference instrument approved by the member countries, will be used for the&#13;
              evaluation of national VS and supported under the GPAI.                In terms of the&#13;
              emergency response, this will be a medium-term activity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        (ii)   Updating the National Emergency Contingency Plan for HPAI: Building on&#13;
              existing preparedness and action plans to prevent and control HPAI epidemics in&#13;
              domestic poultry, water fowl and wild birds, a team of national and international&#13;
              consultants will assist the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development&#13;
              (FMARD) to update the existing Emergency Contingency Plan which will be&#13;
              presented to the Government for approval. The consultants will collaborate closely&#13;
              with the NTCAI and all agencies involved in HPAI prevention and control,&#13;
              including departments of animal health, animal production, agricultural extension,&#13;
              diagnostic laboratories and research laboratories as well as representatives from the&#13;
              private sector and civil society.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        (iii) Capacity Building of Personnel: The activity will also support participation of&#13;
              Veterinary and Livestock Services officials and project staff in regional and&#13;
              international information exchanges and dissemination on AI.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(e)    Improving Bio-security in Poultry Production and Trade&#13;
&#13;
14.     On a long-term basis, improving bio-security in poultry production and trade is not only&#13;
an important strategy to guard against the damaging effects of HPAI but also a complicated&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
intervention requiring understanding of the whole value chain. Moreover, restructuring requires&#13;
different approaches in different countries by virtue of the differences in their poultry sector&#13;
infrastructures, marketing characteristics, backyard versus commercial poultry production, and&#13;
socio-economic impact.       This subcomponent will support the restructuring of the poultry&#13;
industry when needed. Restructuring will be a gradual process, affecting the various segments of&#13;
the sector in different ways and at different rates.        In principle, the main activities to be&#13;
considered under this component are: (a) restructuring of production compartmentalization and&#13;
zoning; (b) adjustment to marketing systems and transport; (c) new regulations for&#13;
national/international trade; (d) reassessing farming systems and practices; (e) introducing&#13;
segregation of species; (f) restocking supply of poultry breeding stock from virus-free&#13;
populations; and (g) strengthening bio-security at producing and marketing sites.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Cf)     Compensation and Economic Recovery&#13;
&#13;
15.     The activities under this subcomponent will consist of:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        (i)   Establishment of a National Compensation Policy and National Compensation&#13;
              Fund: Early detection and reporting as well as rapid response depend critically on&#13;
              the incentives for poultry owners to report very quickly any sick and/or dead&#13;
              poultry to their veterinarians.       For this to happen, adequate compensation&#13;
              arrangements are absolutely essential. The existing veterinary law provides for the&#13;
              establishment of a compensation fund, but no steps have been taken as yet to&#13;
              develop the required implementation arrangements, including financing, fiduciary&#13;
              aspects, eligibility criteria, payment arrangements, flow of funds, etc. The Project&#13;
              will provide technical support to do so. Compensation payments could, depending&#13;
              on the scope of disease outbreaks, pose a significant fiscal burden on the state, and&#13;
              the Project will provide financial resources to help establish the compensation&#13;
              facility.&#13;
&#13;
        (ii)  Support to Economically Vulnerable Groups: In Nigeria, like in many developing&#13;
              regions, the smallholder sector has little or no access to animal health services and&#13;
              it is highly exposed to the consequences of a HPAI epidemic. This activity will&#13;
              provide support to low-income groups that are particularly vulnerable by including&#13;
              activities specifically designed to increase small farmers' awareness, improving&#13;
              animal health services at the community level, and providing grants for additional&#13;
              compensation to aid livelihood diversification in case of economically vulnerable&#13;
              groups.&#13;
&#13;
        (iii) Restocking: This activity will support advisory services that will enable eligible&#13;
              poultry stakeholders to adopt output-enhancing techniques and measures for&#13;
              prevention and control of avian influenza-related diseases.         The Project will&#13;
              finance:&#13;
&#13;
                a.   advisory services that will accompany new investment and restocking&#13;
                     activities in project areas on request by the thematic associations; and&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
               b.    advisory services that will support ongoing activities on prevention and&#13;
                     control of the dreaded disease.&#13;
&#13;
16.     Beneficiaries of the Compensation Fund under this Project will receive technical and&#13;
management assistance from notable service providers that will be engaged by the State Project&#13;
Office in order to equip them with the necessary skills to properly utilize the fund. The Project&#13;
will also (i) fund training and learning events to promote sharing of knowledge and lessons&#13;
learned about emerging good and bad practices in the implementation of the component's&#13;
activities (processes and methods, subject matter issues); (ii) create and maintain a database of&#13;
service providers which will be made accessible to all concerned actors; (iii) encourage the&#13;
participation of service providers in the learning and experience sharing events that will be&#13;
arranged by the State Project Desk Office (SPO); and (iv) fund training on environmentally&#13;
friendly practices for selected service providers.&#13;
&#13;
17.     Under the umbrella of the Community Thematic Association (CTA), the affected farmers&#13;
will elaborate their needs for advisory services in the form of a proposal that will enhance their&#13;
know-how and prevention mechanisms for the disease and help to establish sustainable linkages&#13;
between them and other actors involved in complementary activities. Suitably qualified service&#13;
providers will be eligible to provide services funded under the component. These include, in&#13;
addition to the public Agricultural Development Programs (ADPs), private enterprises, NGOs,&#13;
research and educational institutions, other public sector departments, and international agencies.&#13;
The CC at the SPO, which coordinates the Project at the state level, will provide technical&#13;
assistance to user groups for the evaluation of proposals from service providers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Component 2: Human Health (US$18.25 million)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18.     This component will support the AICP to implement HPAI prevention, preparedness,&#13;
response, and containment activities in the human health sector. These activities reflect an&#13;
assessment of the particular risks, conditions, constraints, needs and possibilities in the country,&#13;
which was undertaken by the project team in close collaboration with the Ministry of Health,&#13;
WHO, CDC and bilateral partners. The design of the program will take into account the&#13;
government's health policy agenda, promoting integration of the avian influenza health strategies&#13;
in a wider framework of strengthening the capacity of the health sector to effectively address&#13;
infectious diseases.&#13;
&#13;
19.     The risk to human health posed by the recent avian influenza outbreaks has led to the&#13;
preparation of a Global Technical Framework (as part of the GPAI) to guide action against an&#13;
increasing pandemic threat. It recognizes that there are areas that require further development&#13;
and that specific actions to be included and supported under country projects need to reflect the&#13;
epidemiological conditions, institutional capacity],needs and priorities of the specific country. In&#13;
case a true human A1 pandemic and emergency were to develop, separate procedures may be&#13;
decided upon, especially with regard to sole-source financing of anti-virals and A1 vaccines.&#13;
&#13;
20.     Not knowing which influenza virus strain is going to cause the next pandemic makes&#13;
planning for it very challenging.        The likely impact of a pandemic depends upon the&#13;
characteristics of the virus such as its infectivity, attack rates in different ages (i.e., the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
proportion of the population infected for each age group) and the severity of disease it causes. In&#13;
the 20th century, pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968. The pandemic of 1918 is&#13;
estimated to have killed almost 50 million people in eighteen months, with peak mortality rates&#13;
occurring in people aged 20-45 years. The pandemics of 1957 and 1968 were milder, but many&#13;
countries nevertheless experienced major strains on health care resources. These pandemics of&#13;
the 20th century demonstrate the variation in mortality, severity of illness and patterns of spread&#13;
that can occur.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
21.     To prevent an outbreak among humans, short-term emergency strategies will be&#13;
supported while planning for longer-term interventions. Initial support will focus on prevention&#13;
and reporting of human cases through the protection of farm workers and others who are in direct&#13;
contact with sick birds, social mobilization and raising public awareness and strengthening of the&#13;
surveillance and laboratory capacity in the affected states. The emphasis of the longer-term&#13;
strategy of this component will be on the reduction of the impact of a pandemic influenza virus&#13;
through: (i) year-round surveillance; (ii) effective and accurate methods of diagnosis; (iii) social&#13;
distance interventions; (iv) vaccines (once they become available); (v) anti-viral drugs; and (vi)&#13;
strengthened medical services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(a)     Enhancing Public Health Program Planning, Delivery and Coordination&#13;
&#13;
22.     Funding will be made available for (i) coordination and management of response at&#13;
federal, state and local government authority (LGA) levels; (ii) adaptation and establishment of&#13;
appropriate Public Health legislation; (iii) identifying and addressing gaps in effective&#13;
communication structures among the levels; and (iv) strengthening the capacity for effective&#13;
planning and supervision of implementation of the response plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(b)     Strengthening of National Public Health Surveillance Systems&#13;
&#13;
23.     To assess risks to public health and establish early warning systems to guide protective&#13;
measures, information is needed on the extent of A1 infection in animals and humans and on&#13;
circulating viruses. National as well as regional surveillance systems must be improved urgently&#13;
in potentially affected countries. When outbreaks in animals occur, active human case detection&#13;
should be done by a coordinated animal-public health team.&#13;
&#13;
24.     There is a need to strengthen national surveillance through the following major activities:&#13;
(i) review and assessment of the current Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR)&#13;
system; (ii) strengthening and harmonizing existing IDSR to include HPAI; (iii) supporting field&#13;
serological and epidemiological surveys to increase case detection and sensitivity of the&#13;
surveillance system; (iv) strengthening existing and establishing specific laboratories on&#13;
Influenza Like Illness (ILI) in a phased approach; (v) providing technical assistance to states and&#13;
LGAs; (vi) supporting capacity building and participation in scientific meetings; (vii) supporting&#13;
hospital mortality studies; and (viii) enhancing community-based surveillance.&#13;
&#13;
25.     Current surveillance systems should be enhanced prior to the possible start of a pandemic&#13;
to assure that the high demand for timely information that can be anticipated in a pandemic can&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
be met. It is also recommended to carry out active sero-surveillance of the population at risk to&#13;
complement the animal health surveillance strategy. To this end, the credit will support the&#13;
following activities:&#13;
&#13;
               a. Improvement of health information and telecommunication systems;&#13;
               b. Improvement of public health laboratory networks;&#13;
               c. Training;&#13;
               d. Studies and research in epidemiological surveillance; and&#13;
               e. Technical assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(c)    Strengthening Health System Response Capacity&#13;
&#13;
26.    The subcomponent will consist of the following activities:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       (i)    Social Distancing Measures: The most effective measure to prevent contracting&#13;
              A1 will be to limit as much as possible contact with the public. Therefore, the&#13;
              Project will support the implementation of immediate term responses, i.e., the&#13;
              classic "social distancing measures7',such as, school closings, backed up by a well-&#13;
              designed communication strategy. For the longer term, options with industry to&#13;
              improve anti-viral and vaccine capacity will need to be explored and supported.&#13;
              The social distancing measures will probably be enforced on advice from health&#13;
              institutions, but health institutions will not be the enforcing group. As a result,&#13;
              financing will be made available to develop guidelines on social distancing&#13;
              measures (e.g., in phases) to operationalize existing or new laws and regulations,&#13;
              support coordination among the Federal Ministries of Agriculture, Health and&#13;
              Information and other agencies and personnel involved in pandemic control&#13;
              activities. Additional preventive actions will be supported that will complement&#13;
              social distancing, such as personal hygiene promotion, including promoting hand-&#13;
              washing and proper cooking, and distribution and use of masks along with&#13;
              increased awareness and promotion of community participation in slowing the&#13;
              spread of the pandemic.&#13;
&#13;
       (ii)   Vaccination: Under this activity, support will be provided for seasonal influenza&#13;
              vaccination among high risk workers as a vital step to prevent an outbreak among&#13;
              humans.     In case of an avian influenza pandemic, when a vaccine becomes&#13;
              available, funding will be made available for implementing an influenza&#13;
              vaccination program that rapidly administers vaccine to priority groups and&#13;
              monitors vaccine effectiveness and safety. To this end, support will be provided&#13;
              for the rehabilitation, expansion, and equipment of cold storage facilities to&#13;
              strengthen the distribution and storage of vaccines and other perishable medical&#13;
              products.    In addition, National Advance Purchase Agreements (NAPAs) of&#13;
              vaccines will be considered. This measure will help operationalize a public private&#13;
              partnership on influenza pandemic vaccines and achieve equitable distribution by&#13;
              matching capacity with total pandemic demand.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       (iii)  Procurement and Distribution of Drugs and Other Supplies: The use of anti-viral&#13;
              drugs, while not a panacea, will be part of the strategy to contain an avian influenza&#13;
              pandemic and to reduce morbidity and mortality. Governments and international&#13;
              agencies, such as WHO, are stockpiling anti-viral drugs. Therefore, support will be&#13;
              provided for the purchase and distribution of anti-viral drugs and antibiotics,&#13;
              determine the susceptibility of the pandemic strain to existing influenza anti-viral&#13;
              drugs, and target use of available supplies; adoption of measures to avoid&#13;
              inappropriate use to limit the development of anti-viral resistance and ensure that&#13;
              this limited resource is used effectively. The objective of anti-viral prophylaxis is&#13;
              to prevent influenza illness and will need to continue throughout the period of&#13;
              exposure in a community. Support will be provided to: (i) develop a treatment&#13;
              plan that will address issues of accessibility and priority of distribution and use of&#13;
              anti-virals - special attention will be given to poultry workers, health workers and&#13;
              people living with HIVIAIDS (PLWA); (ii) strengthen drug procurement and&#13;
              supplies systems; (iii) contact tracing and prophylactic treatment; (iv) ensure&#13;
              quality control of drugs and treatment protocols; and (v) monitor patient&#13;
              compliance with treatment regimes and the onset of resistance to anti-viral drugs.&#13;
&#13;
       (iv) Medical Services:       Assistance will be provided to the health care system for&#13;
              preparedness planning to provide optimal medical care and maintain essential&#13;
              community services.       Strengthened clinical care capacity could be achieved&#13;
              through financing plans for establishing specialized units in selected hospitals,&#13;
              treatment guidelines, and hospital infection control guidelines. Also, strategies will&#13;
              be developed to increase hospital bed availability, including deferring elective&#13;
              procedures, more stringent triage for admission, and earlier discharge with follow-&#13;
              up by home health care personnel.         As an influenza pandemic will place a&#13;
              substantial burden on inpatient and outpatient health care services, support will be&#13;
              provided under the APL to rehabilitate and equip selected health facilities for the&#13;
              delivery of critical medical services and to cope with increased demand of services&#13;
              posed by the pandemic, develop intra-hospital infection control measures, mobilize&#13;
              additional health personnel, including training of health personnel, provision of&#13;
              drugs, vaccines, and other medical inputs, diagnostic reagents, including kits, other&#13;
              operational expenses such as those related to mobilization of health teams and&#13;
              salaries, and technical assistance.     Additionally, support will be provided to&#13;
              improve access to information and scientific knowledge using knowledge&#13;
              management tools, including the review and synthesis of scientific information for&#13;
              distribution to the public health community, and undertake applied and clinical&#13;
              research.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Component 3: Social Mobilization and Strategic Communication (US$4.08 million)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
27.    The main challenges that might face the fight against avian flu are largely social and&#13;
cultural which are also aggravated by low risk perception, motivation, trust, and&#13;
povertyltraditional livelihood issues. Therefore, the Project will identify communication lines,&#13;
social beliefs, practices and perceptions which affect behavior and plain habit. This component&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
is designed to promote awareness, participation and improved coordination of the execution of&#13;
emergency contingency plans as outlined under the national avian influenza strategy. It is&#13;
designed to safeguard human health, in particular for extension staff, animal health workers,&#13;
poultry producers and their families, by improving public awareness and information. Under this&#13;
component, support will be provided for the development of strategies to promote public&#13;
awareness and improve coordination of the execution of the national HPAI response strategies&#13;
and plans. Support will be provided for information and communication activities to increase the&#13;
attention and commitment of government, private sector, and civil society organizations, and to&#13;
raise awareness, knowledge and understanding among the general population about the risk and&#13;
potential impact of the pandemic. The component will consist of the following subcomponents:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(a)    Information and Communication Services&#13;
&#13;
28.    This subcomponent will consist of the following activities:&#13;
&#13;
        (i)  Communication Preparedness:        Activities will include developing and testing&#13;
             messages and materials to be used in the event of a pandemic or emerging&#13;
             infectious disease outbreak, and further enhancing infrastructures to disseminate&#13;
             information from national to state and local levels and between the public and&#13;
             private sectors.     Communication activities will support cost effective and&#13;
             sustainable methods, such as, marketing of "hand-washing" through various&#13;
             communication channels via mass media, counseling, schools, etc., and integrated&#13;
             into avian flu specific interventions as well as ongoing outreach activities of&#13;
             ministries and sectors, especially ministries of health, education, agriculture, and&#13;
             transport. Support will be provided for the newly developed Community Strategy&#13;
             and Action Plan on information and communication activities to increase the&#13;
             attention and commitment of government, private sector, and civil society, and to&#13;
             raise awareness, knowledge and understanding among the general population about&#13;
             the risk and potential impact of the pandemic and to develop multi-sectoral&#13;
             strategies to address it.     Community mobilization will take place through&#13;
             institutions that reach the local population, especially in rural areas like, for&#13;
             example, the church and local community leaders. In addition, support will be&#13;
             provided for:     (i) the development and distribution of basic communication&#13;
             materials (such as, question and answer sheets and fact sheets) on influenza,&#13;
             influenza vaccine, anti-viral agents, and other relevant topics; (ii) general&#13;
             preventive measures, such as, "dos" and "don'ts" for the general public; (iii)&#13;
             information and guidelines for health care providers; (iv) training modules (web-&#13;
             based, printed, and video); (v) presentations, slide sets, videos, and documentaries;&#13;
             and (vi) symposia on surveillance, treatment and prophylaxis.&#13;
&#13;
        (ii)  Collaboration with Stakeholders: The multi-dimensional problems associated with&#13;
             HPAI infection necessitate collaboration from a wide range of stakeholders which&#13;
             has to be supported by broad communications and information campaigns to&#13;
             improve public awareness.      The major stakeholders include various ministries&#13;
             (notably those that are members of the Inter-Ministerial Committee), NGOs, civil&#13;
              society, private sector companies and associations (e.g., large poultry production&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
              companies, farmers' associations, veterinarians and farmer involvement at the&#13;
              grassroots level). The activity will support activities designed to improve the&#13;
              effective coordination and collaboration among these stakeholders under the&#13;
              "National Public Enlightenment Committee".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       (iii)  Development of Capacity Building Modules and Rapid Social and Communication&#13;
             Assessment: This activity will support the development and implementation of&#13;
              training courses in communications methodology for extension and veterinary staff&#13;
              as well as health workers at the central and local levels. It will include preparation&#13;
              of local programs, preparation and dissemination of information materials, and the&#13;
              provision of communications and information equipment for use at the local and&#13;
              central levels.  This activity will also involve conducting a rapid social and&#13;
              communication assessment to investigate household and individual health-related&#13;
              behaviors within their complex, rational matrix of personal, organizational, and&#13;
              social realities. The assessment will explore opinions, attitudes, behavior, and&#13;
              motivations of affected communities, leading to understanding of health, livelihood&#13;
              and other social development issues relevant in designing an effective&#13;
              communication strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Component 4: Implementation Support and Monitoring &amp; Evaluation (US$6.89 million)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
29.    This component will support costs associated with project management, coordination and&#13;
monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E). In terms of project management and coordination, the&#13;
Project will support the provision of technical assistance for procurement, financial management&#13;
and technical assistanceltraining and coordination. In terms of M&amp;E, the Project will support&#13;
training in participatory monitoring and evaluation at all administrative levels, monitoring and&#13;
impact evaluation assessments.&#13;
&#13;
30.    In view of the emergency associated with project take-off, the existing structure of the&#13;
Fadama I1 and the HSDP I1 will be used to fast track project delivery. President Obasanjo has&#13;
set-up the NISCAI which is chaired jointly by the Minister of Agriculture and Rural&#13;
Development and the Minister of Health. Membership comprises the ministries, civil society&#13;
organizations, Poultry Association of Nigeria (PAN) and representatives of major development&#13;
partners including the FAO, EU, USAID, the Department for International Development (DFID),&#13;
UNICEF, United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the World Bank and Africa&#13;
Development Bank (ADB). The NISCAI is mainly responsible for: (i) developing a national&#13;
integrated plan as strategies for effective control of the outbreak; (ii) ensuring the successful&#13;
implementation of the integrated plan; (iii) establishing liaison with development partners; (iv)&#13;
raising funds and other support for the preparation and control activities; (v) providing leadership&#13;
at the highest level of government; and (vi) managing the outbreak related information and&#13;
providing technical assistance to heightening gravity.&#13;
&#13;
31.     In addition, President Obasanjo set up the National Technical Committee on Avian&#13;
Influenza (NTCAI) which is co-chaired by the Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural&#13;
Development and the Minister of State for Health.           NTCAI will be responsible for the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
coordination and implementation of the emergency action plan and strategy prepared for the&#13;
prevention and control of outbreak of the A1 and report to the NISCAI. A Crisis Centre has been&#13;
set-up at the State House staffed permanently (24 hours a day) to manage the work of the two&#13;
committees and to relate to the public on information about the A1 and the progress in the&#13;
delivery of the AICP. A Publicity Committee chaired by the Minister for Information provides&#13;
the public with the regular update on the bird flu situation. Thus the Project will be under the&#13;
overall direction of the NISCAI through the NTCAI.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(a)     Project Management&#13;
&#13;
32.     The subcomponent will support the strengthening of the effectiveness and quality of&#13;
project operations. It will support new or existing institutional entities and mechanisms at the&#13;
federal, state and local levels of government for overall project coordination and supervision and&#13;
will help to strengthen the effectiveness and quality of project operations. It will also support, at&#13;
the federal level, the Project Desk Office at the NFDO of FMARD and the Project Desk Office at&#13;
the HSDP I1 of FMOH       - which will be responsible for overall project coordination. The desk&#13;
offices will be managed by an Animal Health CC and Human Health CC, respectively. At the&#13;
state level, the SFDO and the State Health System Project Office will include an Animal Health&#13;
Desk Office and Human Health Desk Office, respectively, tasked with the coordination of the&#13;
Project. At the local government level, the Project will support a Local Government Desk&#13;
(LGD) and a multi-stakeholder committee which would be responsible for, respectively,&#13;
screening and approving project activities and compensation proposals submitted by the&#13;
Community Thematic Associations (CTAs). The LGD will comprise three officers, including an&#13;
Animal Health Officer, Human Health Officer and a Community1 Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
Officer.&#13;
&#13;
33.     Specific items and activities to be funded include equipment, vehicles, operations and&#13;
maintenance costs, and minor civil works for office rehabilitation at the national as well as the&#13;
state and local government desks. It will also finance specialized technical assistance and&#13;
training at the federal, state, and local government levels aimed at developing capacity for&#13;
coordination of implementation. Because this Project will be implemented at the grassroots&#13;
level, the National Project Desk Office will maintain regular liaison with the state level offices&#13;
and through that office with the LGD to ensure effective reporting and backstopping.&#13;
&#13;
34.     As an emergency measure, the AICP organizational structure described above and the&#13;
command chain (Appendix 3) could be seen as sufficient pending the emergence of a more&#13;
relevant, tested and sustainable institutional arrangement. It should be borne in mind that an&#13;
emergency control program such as AICP, with serious implication for the threat of a potential&#13;
influenza pandemic, requires an efficient administrative machinery and command chain for&#13;
successful implementation.        In the local context, the risk of rivalry between various&#13;
specialists/professionals in government institutions must be avoided. In this respect, as soon as&#13;
possible and while the structure of Fadama I1 is being used to jumpstart the animal health&#13;
component of the Project, the FDL&amp;PCS of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, responsible for&#13;
delivery of VS nationwide, should be assisted to strengthen existing VS delivery structures and&#13;
ultimately take fill charge of implementing the animal health component. More so, that not all&#13;
states are currently covered by Fadama 11, whereas some animal health programs, including&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PACE, exist in every state of Nigeria. This calls for flexibility in project coordination, such as,&#13;
to allow the use of other structures than Fadama I1 in states not covered by Fadama 11. This&#13;
would ensure that the state of preparedness is high nationwide. In the short-term, one of the&#13;
roles of the Animal Health CC will include linking up State Veterinary Services Divisions&#13;
(VSDs) and national agencies, e.g., PACE, in those states in consultation with the Director of&#13;
FDL&amp;PCS.&#13;
&#13;
35.     In line with OIE's "Performance, Vision and Strategy (PVS) for National Veterinary&#13;
Services", the development of an appropriate framework and technical capability strengthening,&#13;
accompanied by human and financial capacity strengthening, should lead to the privatization of&#13;
VS and to greater interaction of veterinary service providers with the private sector. In view of&#13;
the above, creating the enabling environment for the privatization of VS in the medium to long-&#13;
term would be pursued as part of this component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(b)     Support to National Technical Committee on Avian Influenza (NTCAI)&#13;
&#13;
36.     Under this subcomponent, the Project will support the enhancement of the current&#13;
database and policy formulation capacity of the NTCAI. The Project will finance two main&#13;
activities: (a) the establishment and operation of Avian Flu Control and Prevention data bank,&#13;
building on the past experience of the relevant research institutes and governmental agencies;&#13;
and (b) capacity building for policy and strategy formulation and implementation. The Project&#13;
will also finance the investment costs (mainly equipment) for establishing the data bank, training&#13;
and international and national consultant services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(c)     Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
37.     This subcomponent of the Project will support the development of simple, but effective&#13;
M&amp;E systems in both implementing ministries and for the Project as a whole. It will also&#13;
support development of an action plan for M&amp;E, training in participatory monitoring &amp;&#13;
evaluation at national, regional and local levels, and a mid-term evaluation workshop.&#13;
&#13;
38.     The Project will support training in participatory monitoring and evaluation at all&#13;
administrative levels, and measurement of performance at various project milestones, including&#13;
four main elements:&#13;
&#13;
        (i)   Management Information System (MIS) integrating existing project M&amp;E&#13;
              structures of Project Desk Office at NFDO and HSDP 11;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        (ii)  Impact evaluation and beneficiary assessments to enhance project implementation&#13;
              performance;&#13;
&#13;
        (iii) Monitoring the performance of project activities; and&#13;
&#13;
        (iv)  Environmental Management Plan.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                               F.     Project Costs and Financing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
39.     Government will utilize three World Bank financed projects to respond to the Avian&#13;
threat as follows: (a) US$7.2 million from the on-going Fadama I1 Project - the Development&#13;
Credit Agreement (DCA) for Fadama I1 has been amended for this purpose; (b) US$5 million&#13;
from the on-going HSDP I1 - no amendment is required in the HSDP 11; (c) US$50 million from&#13;
this proposed emergency operation credit.&#13;
&#13;
40.    As part of the regional operation on AI, the Bank intends to take an umbrella project on&#13;
A1 to its Board to expand the financial envelope in response to the pandemic. Under this&#13;
regional umbrella operation on AI, Nigeria would be supported under a retroactive financing&#13;
mechanism since it has already advanced in the preparation of the A1Project.&#13;
&#13;
41.    The government has pledged that it will waive import duties and taxes on goods and&#13;
services to be procured for the Project on the basis of the "public goods" nature of preventing&#13;
and controlling outbreaks of avian influenza. Details of project costs and financing arrangement&#13;
are in Appendix 5.&#13;
&#13;
42.     At the Project post-appraisal review meeting of the February 23, 2006, it was pointed out&#13;
that the Bank intends to expand the financial envelope for the battle against HPAI pandemic&#13;
regionally. Under the regional program, Nigeria will be supported under a retroactive financing&#13;
mechanism since the country has already started the implementation of an HPAI project under&#13;
the GPAI. At the meeting, Nigeria indicated interest of being a regional hub being the first&#13;
country in Africa to experience an outbreak of HPAI. The Bank pledged to support Nigeria by&#13;
providing two consultants to assist in the areas of assessment, auto-evaluation and preparation of&#13;
relevant operation manuals of A1 in Nigeria. It was emphasized that the possibility of a regional&#13;
program with regional IDA based in Nigeria will not delay the ongoing A1 Project in Nigeria.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                       G.     Studies and Technical Assistance Required&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
43.     The list of studies and technical assistance required are as.follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(a)     Assessment of HPAI in Nigeria: There is the need for epizootiological investigations on&#13;
        the status of A1 virus including H5 and H7 strains which cause HPAI. This can be done&#13;
        through:&#13;
&#13;
        (i)   Serological tests (Haemaglutination Inhibition, Agar Gel Immuno-Diffusion,&#13;
              Competitive Enzyrne-Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay, and DIVA;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        (ii)  Antigen Detection (Immuno-fluorescent test, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase&#13;
              Chain Reaction);&#13;
&#13;
        (iii) Virus Isolation;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    (iv)  Virus Characterization (Gene sequencing, detection and analysis; Haemaglutinin&#13;
          typing; Neuraminidase typing).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(b) Technical Assistance to Upgrade Laboratories and Clinics: The existing laboratories that&#13;
    have been earmarked to carry out diagnosis of HPAI in the country are: NVRI, VTHs at&#13;
    Zaria, Ibadan, Maiduguri, Nsukka and Sokoto. Each of these laboratories should have&#13;
    the capacity to carry out screening direct antigen detection tests, immunoflourescence test&#13;
    and serological tests for antibody detection. The NVRI would be expected to carry out&#13;
    virus isolation and identification and any other isolate characterisation. The following&#13;
    interventions are needed to enable designated laboratories effectively discharge their&#13;
    functions:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    (i)   Upgrading the diagnostic capacity of the six designated laboratories;&#13;
&#13;
    (ii)  Procurement of diagnostic reagents and kits ahead of any outbreak;&#13;
&#13;
    (iii) Standardization of tests and interpretation of results;&#13;
&#13;
    (iv)  Training for laboratory staff in diagnosis of HPAI (may require international&#13;
          cooperation)  - training should involve neighbouring countries;&#13;
&#13;
    (v)   Networking with designated laboratories in the West African sub region and other&#13;
          World reference laboratories.&#13;
&#13;
    It is also necessary to upgrade the clinics in the designated VTHs and selected state&#13;
    veterinary clinics/hospitals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(c) Strategic Research and Linkage with Advanced Research Institutes and Laboratories:&#13;
    Researches are needed on:&#13;
&#13;
    (i)   Socioeconomic aspects of A1 (knowledge, attitudes and perception of&#13;
          HPAVPandemic, prevention and control; social and economic impacts of HPAI on&#13;
          affected communities);&#13;
&#13;
    (ii)  Rapid and inexpensive diagnostic methods;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    (iii) Influence of production system on transmission of A1virus;&#13;
&#13;
    (iv)  Mammalianlavian carriers of A1 virus, including those in zoological gardens and&#13;
          game reserves.&#13;
&#13;
    In view of the limited experience of local research on influenza virus, especially A1 virus,&#13;
    it is desirable that linkages be established with advanced research institutes and&#13;
    laboratories, especially regional and world reference laboratories.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(d)     Assessment of Spread and Containment of HPAI: Studies will be required on:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        (i)    Factors facilitating spread of A1 under local conditions;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        (ii)   Effective and affordable preventive and control methods;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        (iii)  Prevalence of A1 virus in different bird and mammalian species.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(e)     Management of Compensation Fund: Based on lack of significant experience in the&#13;
        management of compensation funds and the risk of mismanagement, the Project will&#13;
        need technical assistance in the development and use of suitable accounting procedures.&#13;
&#13;
44.     As much as practicable, consultancy services will be selected using Request for&#13;
Expressions of Interest, short-lists and Bank SRFP, where required by the Bank's Guidelines.&#13;
Short lists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than $200,000 equivalent per contract&#13;
may be composed entirely of national consultants in accordance with the provisions of paras. 2.7&#13;
to 2.8 of the Consultant Guidelines. Services for assignments that meet the requirements set&#13;
forth in the first sentence of para. 5.1 of the Consultant Guidelines may be procured using&#13;
Single-Source Selection. The recruitment of consulting services will include hiring of research&#13;
institutes and universities, and individuals from these entities will also be contracted to carry out&#13;
various studies, data collection, and monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                         Appendix 4a: Implementation Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
   FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA: Nigeria Avian Influenza Emergency Control&#13;
                              Preparedness and Response Project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.     The Project will be implemented by regular governmental institutions.         The main&#13;
implementing agencies will be the National Inter-ministerial Committee on Avian Influenza&#13;
through the National Committee on Avian Influenza, although other governmental agencies and&#13;
non-governmental organizations and service providers (e.g., private veterinarians, communities)&#13;
will also be involved in a variety of functions.       However, since most of the project's&#13;
administrative, financial and implementation arrangements will be decentralized and demand-&#13;
driven, critical decisions will take place at the local government level at the Community&#13;
Thematic Associations.&#13;
&#13;
2.     Community Thematic Associations (CTAs). The CTAs are apex organizations of&#13;
Economic Interest Groups (EIGs) which have a common interest in raising any of the avian&#13;
family. The CTA will establish a management committee, consisting of a chairperson, secretary&#13;
and treasurer, who would be democratically elected.        Each constituent EIG shall have a&#13;
representative on the CTA management committee. The CTA will identify, prepare and sign off&#13;
on project activities and compensation proposals, assisted by Community Development&#13;
Officer/Facilitators and technical specialists whom they contract directly, and by technical&#13;
assistance and training made available by the State Project Office (SPO).          Once project&#13;
compensation proposals are approved by the Local Government Technical Committee (LGTC),&#13;
described below, CTAs can access project resources. Some communities already have relatively&#13;
advanced levels of organization, either traditionally or from previous or ongoing development&#13;
projects in their local government area, and may be quicker to form CTAs in order to be ready to&#13;
benefit from the Project. However, for those less organized communities, the Project, through its&#13;
social mobilization programs, which are being implemented under the current Fadama-I1 and&#13;
HSDP I1 projects, will be used to set up the CTAs. In order to be eligible to receive funding&#13;
under the Project, beneficiaries must form legally constituted thematic community associations&#13;
as indicated above. Disbursements to the CTAs would occur through Approved Proposals and&#13;
Agreements (APAs), as described in the Project Implementation Manual (PIM).&#13;
&#13;
3.     Local Government Technical Committee (LGTC). Under this Project, decision-&#13;
making on project proposals emanating from the communities is delegated by the state&#13;
government to the LGTC for quick response, composed of members of CTAs and representatives&#13;
of civil society and local government authorities. At least two-thirds of LGTC members are&#13;
potential project beneficiaries. The LGTC discusses, seeks to authenticate claims and approves&#13;
community proposals in the context of available resources.               After the committee's&#13;
recommendations are reviewed by the State Steering Committee for consistency with guidelines&#13;
in the PIM, the State would trigger the release of funds directly to the CTAs, and copies of the&#13;
transactions are thereafter forwarded to the State Office and Local Government Office for&#13;
information and monitoring purposes.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Project Coordination and Oversight. Existing institutions at the national and state&#13;
levels will be responsible for project oversight and coordination.        To strengthen project&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
coordination, the coordinators of other IDA-financed projects will participate in the federal and&#13;
state technical committees of the Project as observers.&#13;
&#13;
5.      At the Federal level, the Project Desk Office of the NFDO and HSDP 11, through the&#13;
Project Desk Offices, will coordinate project activities on behalf of FMARD and FMOH. The&#13;
Technical Committee on Avian Influenza, which will be chaired by the Honourable Minister of&#13;
State for Agriculture with the Honourable Minister of Health as Co-Chairman, will provide&#13;
technical input and coordination with other relevant programs. It will review project progress,&#13;
and review and approve work plans and budgets. The NTCAI will convene at least every three&#13;
months to review progress with implementation, and review and approve work plans and&#13;
budgets. The Project Desk Offices of the NFDOIHSDP I1 will serve as the secretariat for&#13;
NTCAI and will be responsible for day-to-day federal level coordination. The annual work&#13;
programs and budgets of the Project will be subject to review and approval by the Bank. The&#13;
composition, selection process, and responsibilities of NTCAI were agreed at Project appraisal,&#13;
including the job descriptions, recruitment process, and staffing levels of the Desk Office at the&#13;
Project DeskIHSDP 11.&#13;
&#13;
6.      At the State level, the State Fadama Development Office (SFDO) and the State Health&#13;
System Development Project Office (SHSDP) will coordinate activities on behalf of the State&#13;
Technical Committee on Avian Influenza (STCAI) and will include the Field Officer of&#13;
FDL&amp;PCS. The establishment of the STCAI is a condition of disbursement offunds to the states.&#13;
The STCAI will serve as the oversight body, analogous to the NTCAI. It will be chaired by the&#13;
Commissioner of the State Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources and co-chaired by&#13;
Commissioner of State Ministry of Heath, and will meet every three months to assess progress of&#13;
implementation, and review and approve work plans and budgets. The state's annual work&#13;
programs and budgets will be subject to review and approval by the Bank. The Project will&#13;
establish the Project Desk Office (PDO) within the SFDO and SHSDP. Recruitment of the Desk&#13;
Officer will be under terms and condition satisfactory to the Bank. The State Project Component&#13;
Coordinator will report directly to the State Project Coordinator/Program Manager of the ADP&#13;
and State Project Coordinator of HSDP, respectively. The Desk Office will report every six&#13;
months to the State Technical Committee on Avian Influenza. In order to perform its project&#13;
coordination functions effectively, it will be accorded sufficient operational flexibility and&#13;
autonomy. The Desk Office will be responsible for executing a communications strategy,&#13;
organizing training of facilitators, all relevant stakeholders, tracking financial and physical&#13;
progress of subprojects implemented by CTAs, using a management information system, and&#13;
monitoring and evaluating performance. These and other roles and responsibilities of the Desk&#13;
Office are detailed in the PIM.&#13;
&#13;
7.      At the Local level, a Local Government Desk (LGD) and Local Government Technical&#13;
Committee (LGTC) will be established by the Project. The LGD will comprise three civil&#13;
servants    including    an   Animal     Health  Officer,    Human    Health    Officer   and    a&#13;
CommunityA4onitoring and Evaluation Officer seconded to the Project to play the role of a&#13;
clearing house for project proposals. It will also screen proposals to ensure that they meet a&#13;
basic set of criteria as spelt out in the PIM, and will call meetings of the LGTC to review and&#13;
approve the proposals. The LGTC will also be responsible for reviewing and approving advisory&#13;
service activity proposals. The LGTC will be chaired by the chairperson of the local government&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
council or hislher representative; a traditional or community leader will serve as the deputy&#13;
chairperson.   Government representation in the LGTC will be limited to one-third of the&#13;
committee's total membership in order to ensure a majority representation of the diverse&#13;
stakeholder-beneficiary groups -CTAs,     civil society and the private sector groups. The LGTC&#13;
will also be responsible for monitoring community mobilization efforts.&#13;
&#13;
8.      Subproject Cycle:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        (i)   Community Thematic Associations collect information on farms infected by the&#13;
              disease and prepare detailed proposals.&#13;
&#13;
        (ii)  Proposals from CTAs are submitted to the LFD, where they undergo initial&#13;
              screening against an agreed checklist to determine completeness of the&#13;
              documentation.&#13;
&#13;
        (iii) The screened proposals are then submitted to the LGTC, where proposals are&#13;
              reviewed and approved, based on standardized resource envelopes.&#13;
&#13;
        (iv)  The STCAI and the State Desk Office technically evaluate approved subprojects&#13;
              and confirm compliance with established guidelines before requesting the National&#13;
              Office to release funds.&#13;
&#13;
        (v)   Subproject Agreements (SPAS) are signed between the State Desk Office and the&#13;
              CTA. These agreements will spell out the terms and conditions for the release of&#13;
              funds.&#13;
&#13;
        (vi)  Project resources are then transferred directly from the Project to the CTA's bank&#13;
              account.&#13;
&#13;
        (vii) CTAs are responsible for use of and execution of project activities.&#13;
&#13;
9.      Government will appoint Component Coordinators (CC) within the NFDP-I1 and NHSDP&#13;
to coordinate and oversee the implementation of project activities within their respective ministry&#13;
and its subordinate and associated institutions. The CCs will also be responsible for coordinating&#13;
with other relevant government agencies and departments so as to ensure effective inter-agency&#13;
collaboration. The CCs will also be responsible for the preparation of WPs and budgets for their&#13;
respective project components as well as for providing inputs to the quarterly and annual progress&#13;
reports and financial monitoring reports (FMRs). The CCs will be assisted by staff and, as&#13;
necessary, consultants who will support planning and implementation of activities as well as M&amp;E&#13;
of project activities in both ministries.&#13;
&#13;
10.     The Project Desk Office of the Fadama I1 and the Health Systems Project, which is already&#13;
coordinating the implementation of the Bank-financed projects, will be entrusted with the&#13;
coordination of project activities, technical assistance and training as well as with the fiduciary&#13;
tasks of procurement and financial management.           The PDO will be responsible also for&#13;
consolidating the annual WPs and budgets for submission to the implementing agencies, the&#13;
Republican Emergency Antiepidemic and Antiepizootic Commission and IDA as well as for the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
consolidation of quarterly FMRs and progress reports. The PDO will be strengthened by the&#13;
recruitment of additional staff/consultants responsible for overall administration of training&#13;
activities, procurement and financial management.           To facilitate the management and&#13;
implementation of the Project, a Project Implementation Manual (PIM) is to be prepared as a&#13;
condition of disbursement.&#13;
&#13;
11.     At the local government and state levels, implementation will be the direct responsibility&#13;
of the respective LGNState Desk Offices. Small inter-agency Project Desk Offices will be&#13;
established at the local level to work under the supervision and guidance of the State Project&#13;
Office.&#13;
&#13;
12.     Following the confirmation of Avian Flu in Nigeria, the President set up NISCAI to&#13;
ensure a comprehensive approach to combating the disease to safeguard the multi-billion dollars&#13;
Nigeria poultry industry and to protect human lives. This Inter-Ministerial Committee reports&#13;
regularly to the President and the Federal Executive Council who lead the command. Below the&#13;
NISCAI there are two other specialized committees:&#13;
&#13;
           (a) The National Technical Committee on Avian Influenza (NTCAI), which includes&#13;
               all stakeholders from both the public and private sectors; and&#13;
&#13;
           (b) The Publicity Committee, led by the Minister of Information to inform and&#13;
               sensitize the public about the disease.&#13;
&#13;
13.     Before the NTCAI, there were sector-specific technical committees in both the&#13;
agriculture and health ministries, who previously prepared their emergency preparedness plans.&#13;
For example, the Department of Livestock met with all the State Directors of Veterinary Services&#13;
in the country to agree on the implementation of the plan and the reporting patterns. The State&#13;
Directors through their Technical Committees (States) receive information and reports on Avian&#13;
Flu from the Local Government Veterinarians which they relate to the Director of FDL&amp;PCS,&#13;
who represent them at the enlarged Technical Committee.&#13;
&#13;
14.     The campaign at the field level involves experts from federal, state and local&#13;
governments as well as those of the international and donor communities. In this way, the&#13;
operations and outcomes are very transparent to follow the chain of command.&#13;

Note: Allocations for the Emergency Imports activity of the Project are included in the allocations for the other four&#13;
components.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Government will utilize three World Bank financed projects to respond to the avian threat as&#13;
follows: (a) US$7.2 million from the ongoing Second National Fadama Development Project&#13;
(Fadama 11) - the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) for Fadama I1 has been amended for&#13;
this purpose; (b) US$5 million from the ongoing HSDP I1 Project. There are no amendments&#13;
required in the HSDP 11; (c) US$50 million from the proposed emergency operation credit. The&#13;
government has confirmed that it will waive import duties and taxes on goods and services to be&#13;
procured for the Project on the basis of the "public goods" nature of preventing and controlling&#13;
outbreaks of avian influenza.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                           Appendix 6: Procurement Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
   FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA: Nigeria Avian Influenza Emergency Control&#13;
                              Preparedness and Response Project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.     As described in OP 8.50 for Emergency Recovery Assistance (ERA), in addition to&#13;
emergency assistance, the Bank may support operations for prevention and mitigation in&#13;
countries prone to specific types of emergencies. Such operations could assist in: (a) developing&#13;
a national strategy; (b) establishing an adequate institutional and regulatory framework; (c)&#13;
carrying out studies of vulnerability and risk assessment; (d) reinforcing vulnerable structures;&#13;
and (e) acquiring hazard-reduction technology.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Given the threat that HPIA may pose to the economic and social fabric of the country as&#13;
well as to the health of the population because of the risk of an influenza pandemic, the Project&#13;
will be financed through a Credit to be approved following ERA procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.     Procurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
"Guidelines:    Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004, and&#13;
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May&#13;
2004, and with the provisions stipulated in the Credit Agreement.           Agreements covering&#13;
procurement methods, thresholds, and other conditionality will be consistent with ERA&#13;
assistance guidelines and determined for the Federal Republic of Nigeria according to its&#13;
capacity and experience with Bank procurement.&#13;
&#13;
4.      The activities covered under the Project will be implemented on the basis of annual work&#13;
plans to allow for needed flexibility in adjusting activities to account for in-country experience&#13;
and the lessons from implementation by other countries participating in the multi-country GPAI.&#13;
Accordingly, the following approach to procurement will be adopted.&#13;
&#13;
5.      The CC will be a signatory to the Project Account. Three other officers will understudy&#13;
the Procurement, Financial and Monitoring and Evaluation Specialists at the NFDO during the&#13;
period of transition, estimated at six months. The same transitional arrangement will apply to the&#13;
human health component of the Project. This is more so, that not all states are currently covered&#13;
by Fadama 11, whereas some animal health programs, including PACE, exist in every state of&#13;
Nigeria. This calls for flexibility in project coordination such as to allow the use of other&#13;
structures than Fadama I1 in states not covered by Fadama 11. This would ensure that the state of&#13;
preparedness is high nationwide. In the short term, one of the roles of the Animal Health CC&#13;
will include linking up State Veterinary Services Divisions (VSDs) and national agencies, e.g.,&#13;
PACE, in those states in consultation with the Director of FDL&amp;PCS.&#13;
&#13;
6.      Implementing Agency Assessment. The Bank has carried out a procurement capacity&#13;
assessment of the Agricultural Projects Implementation Units (PKJs) for National Fadama&#13;
Development Project and the Health Systems Development Project in the Federal Ministries of&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Agriculture and Health, which will be responsible for fiduciary tasks, including procurement,&#13;
and found them satisfactory. Procurement staff in the PIUs has considerable experience in&#13;
World Bank procurement guidelines and procedures. The same qualified staff to be supported&#13;
by another experienced procurement staff, will be responsible for procurement under this Project.&#13;
Previous post procurement review conducted indicated that procurement under the ongoing&#13;
Agricultural Support Services Project has worked well. The ongoing procurement reform at the&#13;
federal and some states has shown improvement in procurement capacity. Therefore, the Project&#13;
risk is classified as moderate. The annual Procurement Plan (PP) will define thresholds for prior&#13;
review appropriate to the category; these thresholds will be determined so as to minimize prior&#13;
review as appropriate to the level of risk.&#13;
&#13;
7.      Procurement Plan. A Procurement Plan (PP) covering the initial 18-month period of&#13;
project implementation has been prepared by Negotiations. The updated PP for each subsequent&#13;
year will be submitted to the Bank for approval before the end of the previous year and will use a&#13;
pre-defined standard format which will, as a minimum, list: (i) goods and services to be&#13;
procured during the following calendar year; (ii) their value; (iii) the method of procurement; and&#13;
(iv) the timetable for carrying out the procurement. At the time of approving the annual work&#13;
program, IDA will agree on the consistency with the application of the Bank procurement&#13;
guidelines to the specific procurement lots expected during the year and their methods of&#13;
procurement. If needed, the plan could be revised and re-submitted. The Procurement Plan shall&#13;
set forth those contracts which shall be subject to the Bank's prior review process. All other&#13;
contracts will be subject to post review.&#13;
&#13;
8.      Procurement Methods and Thresholds.              The Financing Agreement defines the&#13;
appropriate methods and thresholds for International Competitive Bidding (ICB), National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB), Limited International Bidding (LIB), or Shopping in accordance&#13;
with ERA guidelines.         Thresholds for project procurement methods and prior-review&#13;
requirements have been indicated on the basis of Bank's assessment of the capacity of the PIU,&#13;
which will be responsible for procurement, the estimated risks of corruption in the country, the&#13;
level of progress made on the country procurement reform agenda, and the country's capacity of&#13;
construction and manufacturing industries.&#13;
&#13;
9.      Advertisement. The General Procurement Notice (GPN) shall be published in the on-&#13;
line edition of DgMarket and Development Business before Board presentation.                Special&#13;
Procurement Notices (SPN) for all ICB goods contracts and Requests for Expression of Interest&#13;
for consulting assignments with firms exceeding the value of US$200,000, and equivalent&#13;
US$100,000 for individual consultants shall be published in at least two National dailies of a&#13;
wide circulation and the on-line edition of the DgMarketIUNDB and posted on the websites of&#13;
the Federal Ministries of Agriculture and Health.&#13;
&#13;
10.      Procurement of Works. Works to be procured under this Project would be done using&#13;
Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) for all ICB and National SBD agreed with or&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank. Minor civil works estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent per&#13;
contract, which are labor intensive, spread over time and which do not lend themselves to&#13;
grouping and therefore are unlikely to attract foreign bidders, may be procured under&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
procedures as detailed in paragraph 3.5 of the "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and&#13;
IDA Credits" May, 2004.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11.     Procurement of Goods. Goods to be procured under this Project would be done using&#13;
the Bank's SBD for all ICB and National SBD agreed with or satisfactory to IDA. Procurement&#13;
for readily available off-the-shelf goods that cannot be grouped or standard specification&#13;
commodities for individual contracts of less than US$100,000 equivalent, may be procured under&#13;
Shopping procedures as detailed in paragraph 3.5 of the "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD&#13;
Loans and IDA Credits" May, 2004 and June 9, 2000 Memorandum "Guidance on Shopping"&#13;
issued by IDA.&#13;
&#13;
12.     Selection of Consultants. As much as practicable, consultancy services will be selected&#13;
using Request for Expressions of Interest, short-lists and Bank SRFP, where required by Bank's&#13;
Guidelines. Short lists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than $200,000 equivalent&#13;
per contract may be composed entirely of national consultants in accordance with the provisions&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of paragraphs 2.7 through 2.8 of the Consultant Guidelines. Services for assignments that meet&#13;
the requirements set forth in the first sentence of para. 5.1 of the Consultant Guidelines may be&#13;
procured using Single-Source Selection. The recruitment of consulting services will include&#13;
hiring of Research Institutes and Universities, and individuals from these entities will also be&#13;
contracted to carry out various studies, data collection, and monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
13.    UN Agencies as Procurement Agents. For several years, a number of specialized UN&#13;
and bilateral agencies operating in the Region have supported various country agencies in the&#13;
procurement of drugs, vaccines, specialized test equipment and supplies, and other materials.&#13;
Using this type of assistance will be part of the Project's procurement arrangements.             In&#13;
accordance with the Procurement Guidelines, Section 3.9, the Project will include the use of&#13;
Specialized Agencies of the United Nations (WHO, UNDP and UNICEF) as suppliers of goods&#13;
(mainly for drugs and vaccines and some medical supplies, such as reagents), following their&#13;
own procedures of procurement. In addition, it is foreseen under the Project to use UNDP as&#13;
procurement agent. The use of UN Agencies as agents will have to meet the requirements of&#13;
Sections 3.10 and 3.15 of the Procurement Guidelines. The procurement agents will follow&#13;
Bank's Procurement Guidelines under the standard agreement between the Bank and the&#13;
respective agency.&#13;
&#13;
14.    Payment under Emergency Assistance Provisions. Following ERA procedures, the&#13;
Project is likely to include financing for items included on a positive list of imports identified as&#13;
necessary under a well-defined preparedness and response program to be prepared as part of&#13;
project implementation. In case of a declared global influenza pandemic, which will trigger&#13;
disbursement conditions for critical imports, support will be provided under the Project for the&#13;
procurement of a positive list of critical imports. These may be procured under Modified&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (MICB), according to paragraphs 2.66 and 2.67 of the&#13;
Procurement Guidelines.       Also, commonly traded commodities may be procured through&#13;
organized international commodity markets or other channels of competitive procurement&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with the provision.&#13;
&#13;
15.    Critical Inputs. The positive list of critical inputs to be prepared by FGN or to be&#13;
purchased by the Borrower from the private sector, based on historical imports during national&#13;
emergencies, will include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       a    Pharmaceuticals and vaccines;&#13;
            Medical and veterinary supplies and equipment;&#13;
            Communication equipment, supplies, and public awareness campaigns;&#13;
            Food containers and water containers;&#13;
&#13;
       a    Protective clothing and gear.&#13;
&#13;
16.    Disbursements for items procured under emergency assistance provisions can be made&#13;
for up to 100 percent of import costs. No more than 20 percent of the Credit proceeds may be&#13;
used for retroactive financing of expenditures, and the payments must have been made after the&#13;
appraisal mission.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17.    Publication of Results and Debriefing:            On-line (DG Market, UN Development&#13;
Business, and/or Client Connection) publication of contract awards would be required for all&#13;
ICB, NCB, Direct Contracting and the Selection of Consultants for contracts exceeding a value&#13;
of USD 200,000. In addition, where prequalification has taken place, the list of pre-qualified&#13;
bidders will be published.     With regard to ICB, and large-value consulting contracts, the&#13;
Borrower would be required to assure publication of contract awards as soon as IDA has issued&#13;
its 'no objection' notice to the recommended award. With regard to Direct Contracting and&#13;
NCB, publication of contract awards could be in aggregate form on a quarterly basis and in local&#13;
news papers. All consultants competing for an assignment involving the submission of separate&#13;
technical and financial proposals, irrespective of its estimated contract value, should be informed&#13;
of the result of the technical evaluation (number of points that each firm received), before the&#13;
opening of the financial proposals.      The PMU would be required to offer debriefings to&#13;
unsuccessful bidders and consultants, should the individual firms request such a debriefing.&#13;
&#13;
18.    Fraud, Coercion and Corruption: All procuring entities as well as bidders, suppliers&#13;
and contractors shall observe the highest standard of ethics during the procurement and&#13;
execution of contracts financed under the Project in accordance with paragraphs 1.15 &amp; 1.16 of&#13;
the Procurement Guidelines and paragraphs 1.25 &amp; 1.26 of the Consultants Guidelines. The PIU&#13;
will follow the Bank's anti-conuption measures and will not engage services of firms and&#13;
individuals debarred by the Bank. The listing of debarred firms and individuals is located at:&#13;
l1ttp://~~~.w0rldt~a1~k.org/htn11~0priproc~1re/debars.htn1l&#13;
&#13;
19.    Frequency of Procurement Supervision. In addition to the prior review supervision to&#13;
be carried out from IDA offices, the capacity assessment of the Implementing Agency has&#13;
recommended two supervision missions to visit the field to carry out post review of procurement&#13;
actions.&#13;
&#13;
20.    Procurement Audits.        Because the Project has a strong element of decentralized&#13;
implementation, and to help IDA carry out post-reviews of procurement actions, consultants will&#13;
be contracted (as a cost to the Project) to carry out annual procurement audits of a sample of&#13;
contracts under Terms of Reference acceptable to the Bank.&#13;

&#13;
   FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA: Nigeria Avian Influenza Emergency Control&#13;
                              Preparedness and Response Project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                      A. Objective of the Financial Management System&#13;
&#13;
1.     The Financial Management (FM) System will support the implementing units in&#13;
deploying project resources to produce the required outputs, with due attention to economy,&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness. It must be capable of producing timely, understandable, relevant&#13;
and reliable financial information to enable the implementing units to plan, coordinate, monitor&#13;
and appraise the Project's overall progress towards the achievement of its objectives as well as&#13;
ensuring that funds provided will be used for the purposes intended.&#13;
&#13;
Implementing Entities and Financial Management&#13;
&#13;
2.     At the Federal level, the National Inter-ministerial Steering Committee (NISC), through&#13;
the National Technical Committee on Avian Influenza (NTCAI) already constituted, will serve&#13;
as the oversight body. It will review project progress, review and approve work plans and&#13;
budgets. The Project Offices at the National Fadama Development Office (Project Desk Office)&#13;
and Health System Development Project (HSDP) of Federal Ministry of Health will have overall&#13;
responsibility for execution of the Project. Within the Project Desk Office and HSDP 11, the&#13;
current respective Finance Departments, which are headed by professionally qualified Project&#13;
Accountants supported by appropriately qualified staff, would be responsible for the financial&#13;
management aspects of the Project. Specifically, they will be responsible for: (a) preparing&#13;
activity budgets, monthly US$           Designated   Account reconciliation     statement, bank&#13;
reconciliations, expenditure control systems, accounting, internal audit, quarterly SOE&#13;
Withdrawal Schedule, monthly financial reporting, quarterly financial monitoring reports (FMR)&#13;
and annual financial statements (AFS); and (b) ensuring that the project financial management&#13;
arrangements are acceptable to the government and IDA. They will also forward the FMR and&#13;
AFS to the Ministry of Finance and IDA. Additional staff, as may be needed, will be deployed&#13;
to perform the FM tasks associated with this Project.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Government, through Project Desk Office, will also establish a "Compensation Fund".&#13;
The Project will provide up to US$9.62 million to finance this facility, exclusively earmarked,&#13;
however, for outbreaks of HPAI. It will be a condition of disbursement for this subcomponent&#13;
that the modalities for operating the fund have been established and have been approved by IDA.&#13;
Project Desk Office need to develop specific and transparent rules and regulations through&#13;
consultancy on: (a) the actual mobilization of the needed financing, notably as regards cost-&#13;
sharing by livestock owners; (b) the intermediate disposition of such funds until they are actually&#13;
needed; (c) the procedural steps required to trigger actual compensation payments; and (iv) the&#13;
administrative and payment arrangements in the event of an authorized case of compensation.&#13;
Also needed are precise guidelines for: (i) establishing and verifying compensation claims; (ii)&#13;
determining the amount of compensation per animal; (iii) recording and reporting stamping out&#13;
and compensation claims; (iv) actual payment to legitimate beneficiaries; and (v) monitoring&#13;
payments.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4.      At the State level, the Project Offices of the State Fadama Development Office (SFDO)&#13;
and the State Health System Development Project (SHSDP) will have overall responsibility for&#13;
execution of components of the Project assigned to them. It will be responsible for general&#13;
oversight of the technical and financial aspects of the Project with operational autonomy and&#13;
flexibility to carry out its roles and responsibilities. Within the SFDO and SHSDP their current&#13;
arrangements with each Project Financial Management Unit (PFMU), which are headed by&#13;
professionally qualified Project Accountants supported by appropriately qualified staff, would be&#13;
extended to cover the financial management aspects of the Project. Specifically, the PFMU will&#13;
be responsible for: (a) preparing activity budgets, monthly bank reconciliation, expenditure&#13;
control systems, accounting, monthly submission of expenditure data and reimbursement request&#13;
to Project Desk Office at NFDO and HSDP 11,respectively, internal audit and monthly financial&#13;
reporting; and (b) ensuring that the project financial management arrangements are acceptable to&#13;
the government and IDA. Additional staff as may be needed will be deployed to perform the FM&#13;
tasks associated with the Project.&#13;
&#13;
5.      At the Local level, a Local Government Technical Committee (LGTC) will be&#13;
established and chaired by the chairperson of the local government council, while a traditional or&#13;
community leader will serve as the deputy chairperson. A Local Government Desk Office&#13;
(LGDO), with an "Animal Health" and "Human Health" component, will serve as a secretariat.&#13;
The LGDO will be responsible for general oversight of the technical and financial aspects of the&#13;
Project with operational autonomy and flexibility to carry out its roles and responsibilities.&#13;
Specifically, they will be responsible for:         (a) preparing activity budgets, monthly bank&#13;
reconciliation, expenditure control systems, accounting, monthly submission of expenditure data&#13;
and reimbursement request to Project Desk Office at NFDO and HSDP 11, respectively, internal&#13;
audit and monthly financial reporting; and (b) ensuring that the project financial management&#13;
arrangements are acceptable to the government and IDA.&#13;
&#13;
6.       All finance personnel will be given appropriate training and tools to perform their&#13;
financial functions in compliance with Bank requirements.&#13;
&#13;
Risk Analysis&#13;
&#13;
7.       Inherent Risks. The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), which was&#13;
conducted in CY 2000, assessed the risk of waste, diversion and misuse of funds as high until&#13;
such a time as the CFAA recommendations have been implemented.                  A review of the&#13;
implementation of CFAA recommendations in January 2005 revealed that some of the identified&#13;
weaknesses have been addressed under EMCAP and through other government initiatives aimed&#13;
at improving financial management and accountability. It was observed that substantial reforms&#13;
have been implemented, especially over the last 3 years. The review showed that although much&#13;
is still needed to be done, the impact of the reform has been positive. The review, however,&#13;
noted that the fiduciary assurance environment remains weak. An update of the CFAA is&#13;
required to conJirm the current level of risk. At the State level, PFMUs have been established&#13;
after due consultations between the Bank and the Federal Ministry of Finance on the one hand,&#13;
and the Federal Ministry of Finance and the State Governments on the other. The PFMU's&#13;
support centralized maintenance of a designated account and other required bank accounts for&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
every Bank-assisted project and provision of financial management services (cash management,&#13;
fund requisitions, payment processing, accounting, internal control and audit and financial&#13;
reporting) to each project on the basis of MoUs. This arrangement can be regarded as a form of&#13;
country FM system in use. In the case of this Project, PFMUs will provide the required FM&#13;
support services under the arrangement as outlined above for components of the Project to be&#13;
implemented at the state level.&#13;
&#13;
8.      Control Risk. The overall control risk from a financial management perspective is&#13;
considered moderate; the high inherent risk is offset by: (a) use of existing FM arrangements of&#13;
Project Desk Office at NFDO and                 HSDP I1 at the federal level, complementing it with&#13;
additional capacity as may be needed in areas of significant weaknesses as identified in the table&#13;
below; (b) use of existing PFMU arrangements at the state level, supported by a number of&#13;
professionally qualified project accountants and internal auditors who have been trained in Bank&#13;
procedures and have a good appreciation of the use of computers, a more robust internal control&#13;
system and sound financial procedures and systems in which the PFMU staff have been trained;&#13;
(c) additional FM capacity to be developed at the local level; (d) existing external audit&#13;
arrangements are to be extended to the Project; (e) centralization of overall project accounting&#13;
and reporting responsibilities at Project Desk Office at NFDO and HSDP 11.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Significant Weaknesses                                       Resolution&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Some internal control weaknesses were identified  The FM and Internal Audit Department at the Project&#13;
  during a recent FM supervision of Project Desk    Desk Office at NFDO and HSDP I1requires further&#13;
  Office at NFDO and HSDP 11. This also included    training to enhance efficiency in the discharge of FM and&#13;
 weak internal audit unit.                          audit duties.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Financial Management Systems&#13;
&#13;
9.       The overall project funding will consist of IDA Credit, co-financing from FADAMA I1&#13;
and HSDP I1projects. Counterpart contributions will be in the form of direct funding of related&#13;
activities and expenditure managed through normal government processes and systems. IDA&#13;
will sign a credit agreement with the Federal Ministry of Finance.&#13;
&#13;
Funds Flow and Banking Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
10.      IDA will disburse the credit through two US$ Designated Accounts (DAs), opened and&#13;
operated by Project Desk Office at NFDO and HSDP 11,respectively.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11.   Specific funding, banking and accounting arrangements for Project Desk Office and&#13;
HSDP I1 are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
       a US$ DA to which the initial deposit and replenishments from IDA funds will be&#13;
       lodged;&#13;
&#13;
    a  a current US$ Interest Account in a bank acceptable to IDA to which interest on the DA&#13;
       will be credited;&#13;
&#13;
       a current draw down account in Naira to which draw-downs from the DA will be&#13;
       credited once or twice per month in respect of incurred eligible expenditures,&#13;
       maintaining balances on this account as close to zero as possible after payments;&#13;
&#13;
       the Project will establish a Compensation Fund Naira bank account from which the&#13;
       owners of animals culled will be compensated;&#13;
&#13;
    a  funding of expenditure at the state and local levels will be done on an imprest basis,&#13;
       requiring reporting of quarterly actual expenditure to the Project Desk Office at NFDO&#13;
       and HSDP 11, respectively, before payment of subsequent imprests.          The National&#13;
       Offices will ensure that advances to the state/local governments are accounted for within&#13;
       90 days;&#13;
&#13;
       as far as feasible and possible, payments to beneficiaries will be made by bank draft or&#13;
       direct bank transfers by Project Desk Offices at NFDO and HSDP 11;&#13;
&#13;
       additionally, Project Desk Office at NFDO and HSDP I1 will reconcile their accounting&#13;
       records to the IDA Ledger Loan Account (Washington) in US Dollars/Naira/SDR to&#13;
       keep track of draw-downs from the IDA credit. The account will show: (a) deposits&#13;
       made by IDA; (b) direct payments by IDA, and (c) opening and closing balances.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12.   All bank accounts will be reconciled with bank statements on a monthly basis. A copy of&#13;
each bank reconciliation statement together with a copy of the relevant bank statement will be&#13;
reviewed monthly by the Project Accountant who will expeditiously investigate identified&#13;
differences.   Detailed banking arrangements, including control procedures over all bank&#13;
transactions (e.g., cheque signatories, transfers, etc.), will be documented in the Financial&#13;
Procedures Manual (FPM).&#13;

&#13;
13.     The allocation of the Credit proceeds is presented in the table below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14.     To the extent possible, all of IDA'S share of expenditures should be paid through the US$&#13;
DA. To facilitate disbursements for eligible expenditures for goods and services, the flow-of-&#13;
funds mechanism has been designed with the following guiding principles: (a) the Project Desk&#13;
Office at NFDO and HSDP I1 control and account for project funds; (b) bottlenecks in the&#13;
transfer of funds are minimized via adequate FPM, and transfer arrangements to beneficiaries;&#13;
and (c) implementation transparency and accountability. The Project Desk Office at NFDO and&#13;
HSDP I1 will open, manage and administer a DA each in a commercial bank to cover IDA'S&#13;
share of eligible expenditures. The total authorized allocation of the DA will be US$10 million&#13;
for Project Desk Offices at NFDO and HSDP 11,respectively.&#13;
&#13;
15.     Transaction-based Disbursement Procedures: By effectiveness, the Project will use the&#13;
transaction-based disbursement procedures (as described in the World Bank Disbursement&#13;
Handbook), i.e., direct payment, reimbursement, .and special commitments.             When project&#13;
implementation begins, the quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) produced by the&#13;
Project will be reviewed. Where the reports are adequate and produced on a timely basis, and&#13;
the borrower requests conversion to report-based disbursements, a review will be undertaken by&#13;
the Task Team Leader (TTL) to determine if the Project is eligible. The adoption of report-based&#13;
disbursements by the Project will enable it to move away from time-consuming voucher-by-&#13;
voucher (transaction-based) disbursement methods to quarterly disbursements to the Project's&#13;
Special Account based on FMRs. Detailed disbursement procedures will be documented in the&#13;
FPM.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16.    Quick Disbursable Funds: In the event of a global influenza pandemic, the Recipient&#13;
could obtain quick disbursing funds. These funds will be disbursed against a positive list of&#13;
imports, identified as critical following emergency events.      The declaration of a national&#13;
emergency will be a disbursement condition for this element of the Project. Upon declaration of&#13;
an emergency, government will submit to IDA an initial recovery plan documenting the disaster&#13;
declaration, the related budget appropriation and the proposed use of the funds. The Project&#13;
Desk Offices at NFDO and HSDP I1 will keep IDA informed of updates in the recovery plan as&#13;
the emergency response operations unfold.&#13;
&#13;
17.    Minimum      Value of Applications:       The Minimum Value of Applications for&#13;
reimbursement, direct payment and special commitment is 20 percent of outstanding advance to&#13;
US$ Designated Accounts.&#13;
&#13;
18.    Reporting on Use of the Credit: The supporting documentation for reporting eligible&#13;
expenditures paid from the designated accounts and for reimbursements should be a summary&#13;
report of the Statement of Expenditures and records evidencing eligible expenditures for&#13;
payments against contracts valued at $500,000 for work, $500,000 for goods, $200,000 for&#13;
consulting firms and $1.00,000for individual consultants and a list of payments against contracts&#13;
that are subject to Bank's prior review. The supporting documentation for requests for direct&#13;
payment should be records evidencing eligible expenditures (copies of receipt, suppliers'&#13;
invoices). All supporting documentation for SOEs will be retained at the implementing units and&#13;
must be made available for periodic review by World Bank review missions and external&#13;
auditors.&#13;
&#13;
19.    Monthly Replenishment Applications:         The DA will be replenished through the&#13;
submission of Withdrawal Applications on a monthly basis by the Project Desk Offices at NFDO&#13;
and HSDP I1 and will include reconciled bank statements and other documents as may be&#13;
required until such time as the Borrower may choose to convert to report-based disbursement.&#13;
All disbursements will be channeled through the DA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Other FM Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
20.    Planning and Budgeting: Cash Budget preparation will follow the Federal Government&#13;
procedures. Additionally, financial projections or forecasts for the life of the Project (analyzed&#13;
by year) will be prepared. On an annual basis, the designated Project Accountants in Project&#13;
Desk Office at NFDO and HSDP I1will prepare the cash budget for the coming period based on&#13;
the work program. The cash budget should include the figures for the year, analyzed by quarter.&#13;
The cash budget for each quarter will reflect the detailed specifications for project activities,&#13;
schedules (including procurement plan), and expenditure on project activities scheduled&#13;
respectively for the quarter. The annual cash budget will be sent to the TTL at least two months&#13;
before the beginning of the project fiscal year. Additional detailed procedures for planning and&#13;
budgeting will be documented in the FPM.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
21.    Fixed Assets and Contracts Registers:       A Fixed Assets Register will be prepared,&#13;
regularly updated and checked by both Project Desk Offices at NFDO and HSDP 11. A&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Contracts Register as well as a Quarterly Contract Status Report will also be maintained in&#13;
respect of all contracts with consultants and suppliers. Control procedures over fixed assets and&#13;
contracts with consultants and suppliers/vendors for federal, state and local levels will be in line&#13;
with federal government financial regulations, and detailed in the FPM.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22.     Information Systems: While the accounting system in the Project Desk Office at NFDO&#13;
is partly computerized, that of the HSDP I1 is essentially manual. Both systems would, however,&#13;
be capable of producing the necessary reports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
23.     Financial Reporting and Monitoring: Monthly, quarterly and annual reports will be&#13;
prepared (as outlined below) for the purpose of monitoring project implementation. The reports&#13;
will be submitted to National Technical Committee on AI, Heads of the Relevant Ministries and&#13;
IDA. In compliance with government reporting requirements, monthly returns will also be made&#13;
to the Accountant-General, for incorporation in the Government's accounts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
24.     Monthly: On a monthly basis, the Project Desk Office at NFDO and HSDP I1 will&#13;
prepare and submit the following reports to the National Technical Committee on AI:&#13;
&#13;
          a bank reconciliation statement for each bank account;&#13;
&#13;
          monthly statement of cash position for project funds from all sources, taking into&#13;
          consideration significant reconciling items;&#13;
&#13;
          a monthly Statement of Expenditure classified by project components, disbursement&#13;
          categories, and comparison with budgets, or a variance analysis; and&#13;
&#13;
          Statement of Sources and Uses of funds (by Credit CategoryJActivity).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
25.     Quarterly: Project Desk Offices at NFDO and HSDP I1will submit the quarterly FMR to&#13;
IDA and the National Technical Committee on AI. This will include:&#13;
&#13;
     a    Financial Reports - which include a statement showing for the period and cumulatively&#13;
          (project life or year-to-date) inflows by sources and outflows by main expenditure&#13;
          classifications; beginning and ending cash balances of the Project; and supporting&#13;
          schedules comparing actual and planned expenditures. The reports will also include&#13;
          cash forecast for the next two quarters.&#13;
&#13;
          Physical Progress Reports - which include narrative information and output indicators&#13;
          (agreed during project preparation) linking financial information with physical progress,&#13;
          and highlight issues that require attention.&#13;
&#13;
          Procurement Reports - which provide information on the procurement of goods, works,&#13;
          and related services, and the selection of consultants, and on compliance with agreed&#13;
          procurement methods. The reports will compare procurement performance against the&#13;
          plan agreed at negotiations or subsequently updated, and highlight key procurement&#13;
          issues, such as, staffing and building Borrower capacity.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         SOE Withdrawal Schedule - listing individual withdrawal applications relating to&#13;
         disbursements by the SOE Method, by reference number, date and amount.&#13;
&#13;
26.    Annually: Annual project financial statements in compliance with cash basis IPSAS and&#13;
audited, prepared by Project Desk Offices at NFDO and HSDP 11,respectively, and to be&#13;
submitted on or before June 30 of each year to IDA and the National Technical Committee on&#13;
AI. This will include:&#13;
&#13;
         A Statement of Sources and Uses of Funds (by Credit Categorylby Activity showing&#13;
         IDA and Counterpart Funds separately);&#13;
&#13;
         Statement of Cash Position for Project Funds from all sources;&#13;
&#13;
         Statements reconciling the balances on the various bank accounts (including IDA&#13;
         Designated Account) to the bank balances shown on the Statement of Sources and Uses&#13;
         of Funds;&#13;
&#13;
         SOE Withdrawal Schedules listing individual withdrawal applications relating to&#13;
         disbursements by the SOE Method, by reference number, date and amount;&#13;
&#13;
         Notes to the Financial Statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
27.    Accounting Policies andProcedures: IDA funds will be accounted for on a cash basis&#13;
as prescribed by IPSAS. This will be augmented with appropriate records and procedures to&#13;
track commitments and to safeguard assets. Also, accounting records will be maintained in dual&#13;
currencies (i.e., Naira and US$). The Chart of Accounts will facilitate the preparation of relevant&#13;
monthly, quarterly and annual financial statements, including information on the following:&#13;
&#13;
         Total project expenditures;&#13;
         Total financial contribution from each financier;&#13;
         Total expenditure on each project component/activity; and&#13;
         Analysis of that total expenditure into civil works, various categories of goods, training,&#13;
         consultants and other procurement and disbursement categories.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
28.    Internal Audit: The Internal Audit Units of Project Desk Offices at NFDO and HSDP I1&#13;
will perform internal audit activities for the respective activities funded through the Credit.&#13;
Regular internal audit reports will be submitted to the Heads of Project Desk Offices at NFDO&#13;
and HSDP 11, the National Technical Committee, IDA and the Accountant General of the&#13;
Federation.   Each IAU will be strengthened by the deployment of professionally qualified&#13;
internal auditor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
29.    External Audit: The contracts of the external auditors that have been appointed for&#13;
Project Desk Offices at NFDO and HSDP I1 will be extended to cover this Project. These&#13;
auditors have been appointed based on Terms of Reference acceptable to the Bank to perform&#13;
these audits. The audit of the Project Desk Office at NFDO will also include a review of and&#13;
opinion on the Compensation Fund, including auditing of the measures to ensure that only&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
eligible poultry owners are compensated. In addition to the audit report, the external auditors&#13;
will be expected to prepare Management Letters giving observations and comments, and&#13;
providing recommendations for improvements in accounting records, systems, controls and&#13;
compliance with financial covenants in the IDA agreement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
30.     Financial Management Action Plan: Financial management arrangements as outlined&#13;
above are generally adequate, but a number of actions are required to ensure that arrangements&#13;
are fully satisfactory for the Project, especially with respect to the Compensation Fund. The&#13;
following action plan was discussed with the Borrower during Negotiations.          Satisfactory&#13;
implementation of the action plan will ensure the establishment of a financial management&#13;
system that fully meets requirements of the Project and of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
31.     Supervision Plan:     Supervision activities will include a review of quarterly FMRs;&#13;
review of annual audited financial statements and management letters as well as timely follow up&#13;
of issues arising during implementation; annual SOE reviews; participation in project&#13;
supervision missions as appropriate; and updating the FM rating in the Implementation Status&#13;
Report (ISR). First FM supervision will be undertaken no later than October 2006.&#13;

&#13;
Environmental assessment       9      Environmental Category B&#13;
&#13;
1.      Activities under the proposed Project are not expected to generate any adverse&#13;
environmental effect, since a large part of the Project is geared to supporting prevention&#13;
activities. The Project will, overall, have positive environmental and social impacts. Since the&#13;
Project supports investments for the disposal of carcasses and laboratory wastes, an&#13;
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for carcass disposal facilities will be necessary. This&#13;
EMP will also cover the clean up of animal wastes of infected and culled poultry. The scope of&#13;
this EMP will be specified during the initial period of project implementation. The EMP will&#13;
include guidelines for carcass disposal facilities; it will summarize the potential negative impacts&#13;
of disposals, as well as provide measures for mitigating and monitoring those impacts. While the&#13;
EMP is being prepared, the Project will follow interim guidelines and operating procedures to&#13;
manage and monitor potential negative impacts of carcass disposal. These interim guidelines&#13;
and procedures will be formulated by a technical advisor to the project desk offices. These&#13;
provisions will be included in the PIM to be finalized prior to disbursement. The PIM will be&#13;
updated as necessary to reflect any modifications or additions to the procedures that are&#13;
recommended in the EMP&#13;
&#13;
2.      The proposed investments in laboratory facilities, equipment and staff training will&#13;
improve effectiveness and safety of avian influenza handling and testing procedures by meeting&#13;
international standards established by OIE. If there are existing guidelines from other projects,&#13;
such as HSDP, for the management of medical waste generated in health care facilities, such&#13;
guidelines will be adapted. The Project will also support updating of these guidelines, training of&#13;
healthcare workers to manage medical wastes according to these guidelines and, if necessary, the&#13;
purchase of equipment for the proper handling and disposal of medical waste in participating&#13;
facilities. These provisions will be included in the PIM. If there are no such provisions, a&#13;
Medical Waste Management Plan (MWMP) must be prepared and disclosed by June 30,2006.&#13;
&#13;
3.      The Project will assist the government in developing a strategy for managing future&#13;
emerging and re-emerging zoonotic and infectious disease outbreaks. Such a strategy would&#13;
improve environmental and social safeguards in three areas: (i) mainstreaming environmental&#13;
safeguards into protocols and procedures for the stamping out and disposal of animals during an&#13;
outbreak, in particular by adopting OIE standards; (ii) improving bio-medical waste management&#13;
systems in health facilities and laboratories; and (iii) developing policies on compensation for&#13;
poultry farmers affected by future outbreaks.&#13;
&#13;
4.      As an emergency operation under OPIOD 8.50, the safeguard documents are not required&#13;
to be prepared and disclosed prior to appraisal. However, it is expected that the medical waste&#13;
management plan and the EMP for the carcass disposal facilities will need to be prepared and&#13;
disclosed by no later than end-June, 2006.&#13;

5.      Social Aspects. The main challenges in managing, eradicating, and controlling avian flu&#13;
are both social and cultural. They are also aggravated by low risk perception, motivation, trust,&#13;
and povertyltraditional livelihood issues. Therefore, the Project will identify communication&#13;
lines, social beliefs, practices and perceptions which affect behavior and habit.        There are&#13;
different and particular ethnomedical perceptions, behaviors, and ethnomedical treatments that&#13;
need to be understood for effective project development when selecting specific project&#13;
siteslstates in Nigeria. The Project is designed to address other social development related&#13;
issues, e.g.: (a.)high-risk communities by including as the main populations children, youth, and&#13;
women- since market sales are done by women and backyard poultry assets and income are&#13;
essentially their assets and income; (b) using strategies that will include intensive education and&#13;
community mobilization campaigns that will significantly change behaviors at family level; (c)&#13;
and systematic data collection that will analyze specific outcome indicators in order to introduce&#13;
changes as needed. Specifically, the central role of women and children in managing backyard&#13;
poultry have important implications for the Project: (i) given the involvement of children in&#13;
managing the domestic birds (feeding, egg collection, herding geese and ducks, etc.), awareness&#13;
and educational efforts need to ensure that children are effectively targeted and reached with&#13;
appropriately designed messages, through schools; and (ii) reaching women with critical HPAI&#13;
awareness messages and information will similarly require specific targeting and utilization of&#13;
suitable dissemination and outreach channels.&#13;
&#13;
6.      Strategic Communication. The Project is designed to promote awareness, consensus&#13;
building, support buy-in on mitigation measures by the Nigerian public and stakeholders on the&#13;
AICP in the country. This strategy is predicated on the fact that pandemic will be slowed down&#13;
by everyday behavior change, which is in turn determined by information and beliefs, and also&#13;
by sheer plain habit.      One of the lessons learned from the AIDS epidemic is that public&#13;
information alone does not necessarily generate action. People's response is contingent on social&#13;
networks, social beliefs and how they affect behavior as well as resource availability in their&#13;
community. Government's role is to provide enabling policies for restoration of public health&#13;
infrastructure and preparedness at individual, community and national levels, developing training&#13;
courses in communication methodology and techniques for agricultural extension and veterinary&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
staff, health workers, information and National Orientation staff at federal, state, local&#13;
lovemment levels as well as community based groups, such as, CTAs, CBOs, etc.&#13;
&#13;
7.      The Project is designed to safeguard human health, in particular for extension staff,&#13;
animal health workers, poultry producers and their families, by improving public awareness and&#13;
information. Support will be provided for information and communication activities to increase&#13;
the attention and commitment of government, private sector, and civil society organizations, and&#13;
to raise awareness, knowledge and understanding among the general population about the risk&#13;
and potential impact of the pandemic.      It will also involve conducting a rapid social and&#13;
communication assessment to investigate household and individual health-related behaviors&#13;
within their complex, rational matrix of personal, organizational, and social realities.     The&#13;
assessment will explore opinions, attitudes, behavior, and motivations of affected communities,&#13;
leading to understanding of health, livelihood and other social development issues relevant in&#13;
designing an effective communication strategy.&#13;
&#13;
8.      In Nigeria, poultry production is one of the key means of income generating activities&#13;
and livelihood strategy, and millions of poor farmers and peasants live in close proximity with&#13;
their flocks and depend on poultry production for their survival, often in remote areas. Unlike in&#13;
the West, where poultry production is largely concentrated in huge enterprises, the decentralized&#13;
production in Nigeria poses enormous problems for controlling any outbreak. More than 80&#13;
percent of national poultry inventory, estimated to be more than 143 million free-ranging&#13;
backyard poultry is potentially exposed to avian flu from contact with infected migratory birds.&#13;
Nearly all rural households in Nigeria hold 3-5 backyard poultry, used as a "walking bank" to&#13;
generate rapid cash, in case of need. Some birds and eggs may be sold to neighbors or in near-&#13;
by-markets, but the bulk of backyard poultry is consumed within household and represent an&#13;
important component of the diet. Pro-poor stamping out will be considered, paying equitable&#13;
compensation for poultry lost to stamping out.&#13;
&#13;
9.      The Project will include a subcomponent for local response with small grants going to&#13;
NGOs and communities, much like the HIVIAIDS local response component is supposed to&#13;
work. For effective integratiodcoordination and mainstreaming of the government programs&#13;
aimed at communities, a rapid response system is envisaged in the medium and long terms where&#13;
communities identify their problems in a participatory manner, move towards a local&#13;
development plan and these community local development plans get financed frornlthrough local&#13;
governments, where sector ministries will have provided the funds to deal with health issues.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.      In response to these concerns, the Government of Nigeria has prepared a National Action&#13;
Plan to be supported by the Project. Estimation of the economic benefit, cost-effectiveness and&#13;
distribution of benefits from the combined implementation of the proposed project activities is&#13;
the main objective of this analysis. The standard practice of comparing the incremental stream&#13;
of net benefits "with project" to a "without project" scenario is employed.         The analysis&#13;
considers vims transmission among animals and among humans both jointly and separately. At&#13;
present, HPAI is mainly an animal health problem, although more than half of the 140 registered&#13;
human cases (globally) so far have been fatal. Since it is widely considered that a global&#13;
pandemic of human influenza is both overdue and likely, the analysis is extended to examine&#13;
economic consequences of human-to-human transmission.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Prices of live chicken, both local and commercial, vary in Nigeria. Prices vary from&#13;
N570-600. The table below shows the prices of chicken for both local and commercial.&#13;

&#13;
3.      Both costs and benefits are separated by their impact on households and society in the&#13;
Federal Republic of Nigeria. This allows for more accurate evaluation of the relevant costs and&#13;
benefits. It also minimizes any "double counting" bias. For example, the loss of poultry could&#13;
be viewed as either: (a) the loss of productive asset at the household level that embodies the&#13;
discounted value of future production of meat and eggs; or (b) the loss of a part of agricultural&#13;
output at the national level. As most of the poultry production is currently consumed on-farm,&#13;
valuation of the loss of poultry at the household level will capture economic benefits more&#13;
accurately.      Consideration of the nationwide losses of production, therefore, becomes&#13;
unnecessary because they have already been valued (indirectly) at the household level.&#13;
&#13;
4.       Both costs and benefits have been divided by primary (direct) and secondary (indirect)&#13;
effects. Most of the direct costs and benefits are self-explanatory, and their evaluation is&#13;
relatively straightforward. More importantly, the magnitude of the direct costs and benefits is a&#13;
product of the effectiveness of actions taken domestically, while the extent of indirect benefits&#13;
will be determined overwhelmingly by external factors.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.     Higher prices for food offer a good example. Regional contraction in the supply of&#13;
poultry meat and the commensurate increase in demand for its substitutes will overpower the&#13;
effect of national measures, preventing an increase in the supply of poultry to the small and open&#13;
domestic market of Nigeria. Similarly, a slowdown of the global economy due to a pandemic&#13;
will reduce demand for Nigeria's exports. Conversely, inability to contain animal-to-animal and&#13;
human-to-human transmission will have a devastating effect on the region and more globally.&#13;
Due to their uncertainty and to practical difficulties in estimating them, most of the secondary&#13;
benefits and costs were omitted from the calculations.&#13;

6.      The extent of protection achieved through the implementation of the National Action&#13;
Plan and the activities supported by the proposed Project will depend on the efficacy of the&#13;
prevention, containment and treatment measures.              The assumed levels of efficacy of these&#13;
measures determine the range of protection scenarios. The protection rates are assumed here to&#13;
vary between 33 percent to 80 percent for both birds and humans. The likely impact of an HPAI&#13;
pandemic on unprotected humans was derived using WHO estimates of the effects of human-to-&#13;
human transmission: (a) 30 percent of unprotected humans are likely to be affected; (b) one-&#13;
tenth of them will require hospitalization; and(c) one and a half percent of all human infection&#13;
cases will be fatal. The same parameters were assumed for poultry protection, although all birds&#13;
exposed to the risk were assumed to perish (either from the infection or through stamping out).&#13;
The costs of activities supported under the Project are assumed to remain unchanged for each&#13;
scenario. Finally, the incremental benefits for each of the three protection scenarios were&#13;
evaluated for a period of 20 years, with a discount rate of 12percent.&#13;

7.     The table above presents the major economic outcomes under each of the scenarios&#13;
modelled. The scenario of 80 percent protection results in an estimated 468,000 human lives&#13;
saved and 3,120,000 hospitalizations averted. At the lowest end, the protection rate of 33&#13;
percent still saves 193,050 lives and reduces the number of hospitalizations by 1,287,000.&#13;

            Nigeria - Avian Influenza Control and Human
            Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Nigeria is ill-prepared to contain the
            spread of the HPAI H5N1 and will need considerable support.
            Laboratory capacity for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza
            (HPAI) diagnosis is very weak and National Veterinary
            Research Institute (NVRI) and Public Health laboratories
            have only limited capacity to identify the H5N1 virus
            strain. Quarantine services are also weak, so that with the
            ongoing blanket ban on importation of poultry and poultry
            products, the extent to which the import ban can be enforced
            is doubtful, creating risks not only for Nigeria but for the
            entire region. Specifically, assistance will be required to
            implement the four components (animal health, human health,
            social mobilization, and implementation support for
            monitoring and evaluation) identified in this proposal. If
            control measures are not undertaken, the disease will become
            endemic with continuous flare-ups, causing prolonged
            economic losses and threatening the livelihoods of hundreds
            of millions of poor livestock farmers, jeopardizing
            smallholder entrepreneurship and commercial poultry
            production, and seriously impeding regional and
            international trade and market opportunities. The rural poor
            who rely for a large share of their income on poultry will
            be hit the hardest by loss of income and social distress. In
            the background hovers the threat of a potential pandemic and
            its unimaginable global consequences.
