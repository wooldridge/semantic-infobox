            generation markets in hydro systems - the case of Brazil
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Brazil's electricity sector is made
            up of more than sixty-five, mostly vertically integrated,
            federally- and state-owned monopolies.  The most pressing
            problems in the sector are excessive operational costs and
            large investment needs.  Both of these problems can be
            addressed through more competition and more private
            participation.  There is a consensus among federal and state
            policymakers and key operators that the sector's
            potentially competitive segments should be separated from
            its natural monopoly segments and awarded as concessions or
            sold to private investors.  However, there are important
            technical challenges, one of which relates to competitive
            generation.  First, to ensure open entry and the long-term
            viability of competition in the electricity sector, the
            government must figure out how to competitively allocate
            water rights.  Second, to provide incentives for investing
            in generating capacity, a pricing system must be put in
            place that will ensure recovery of the high sunk capital
            costs characteristic of hydro systems.  This Note describes
            one consistent approach, using incentive-based organization
            and regulation, for overcoming the technical challenges to
            effective competition in the generation market.
