Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
Zimbabwe&#13;
Rural District Council Pilot Capital Development Project&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.01  The project presented for approval is part of a larger and longer term program.&#13;
This program is the Rural District Council Capacity Building Program. Henceforth, this&#13;
larger program is cited as RDCCBP as it is widely referenced within the Government of&#13;
Zimbabwe. For purposes of presentational clarity, the project presented for approval, the&#13;
Rural District Council Pilot Capital Development Project, will be cited as RDC Pilot.&#13;
1.02 As will be explained in detail below, the RDCCBP is an ongoing Program&#13;
composed of three components: Institutional Development; Human Resources&#13;
Development; and Capital Development. The Government has requested Bank support&#13;
for funding of a part of the Capital Development Component which will begin a five year&#13;
program of investment in July 1997, corresponding with the beginning of GoZ financial&#13;
year 1997/98.&#13;
1.03  Because of the mutually reinforcing nature of the three components of the&#13;
RDCCBP, this appraisal covers the entire RDCCBP for the full five-year implementation&#13;
period. At Government's request, the RDC Pilot is dimensioned to finance part of the&#13;
Capital Development Component for the initial period from July 1997 to December 1999.&#13;
The Government has requested that the Bank then provide unified support to all local&#13;
authorities in Zimbabwe through the proposed Local Government Development Project&#13;
(LGDP), building on the lessons learned and policy dialogue to be achieved under the&#13;
RDC Pilot and the ongoing Urban 11 project (Loan 3079-ZIM) which is scheduled for&#13;
completion in December 1998. The LGDP is expected to provide investment financing&#13;
for about five years and will provide a vehicle of broad support to promote&#13;
decentralization and reform in all of Zimbabwe's local authorities.&#13;
1.04 In Chapter III, The Program and the Project, Sections A-E present the RDCCBP&#13;
Program, including Origin, Objectives, Description, Implementation Plan, Costs and&#13;
Financing Plan. Sections F-I present specific arrangements for the RDC Pilot, covering&#13;
Project Financing Plan, Disbursement, Procurement, Accounts and Audits. Finally,&#13;
Sections J-M analyze the Economic, Environmental, Poverty and Risk aspects of both&#13;
RDCCBP and the RDC Pilot Project.&#13;

II. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SECTOR&#13;
A. Zimbabwe's Local Government Structure&#13;
2.01 At Independence in 1980 Zimbabwe inherited a system of local government&#13;
sharply divided on racial grounds. The system consisted of, on the one hand, Rural&#13;
Councils and Urban Councils for the white settler population and, on the other, African&#13;
Councils (later District Councils) for the majority black population. Furthernore, the two&#13;
types of local authority had different parent ministries, with Rural and Urban Councils&#13;
coming under the Ministry of Local Government and Town Planning, whilst African&#13;
Councils came under the Ministry of Internal Affairs.&#13;
2.02 Since independence the Government has been committed to the establishment of a&#13;
unified local government system, to replace the racially based dual system inherited from&#13;
the previous regime. The 1988 Rural District Councils Act provided the legal basis for&#13;
the amalgamation of the two previous types of councils into a Rural District Council. The&#13;
amalgamation process involved various changes in administrative boundaries, in council&#13;
structures and procedures, and also the amalgamation of the two local authority&#13;
associations into a single Association of Rural District Councils (ARDC). In&#13;
implementing these changes both the Ministry of Local Government, Rural and Urban&#13;
Development (MLGRUD) and the ARDC received considerable donor assistance,&#13;
particularly from the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA), in the field of&#13;
training and consultancy.&#13;
2.03  The intention of Government in establishing the RDCs was not only to&#13;
amalgamate the two types of local authority but also to strengthen the role of local&#13;
government in rural areas. Therefore, as part of the preparations for their establishment,&#13;
MLGRUD, with financial support from SIDA, set up a special consultative body known&#13;
as the Forum for Rural Development, to facilitate 'strategic dialogue' between major&#13;
stakeholders concerned with amalgamation and rural local government in general. Over a&#13;
three year period (1991-94), the Forum addressed a number of key policy and legislative&#13;
issues and sponsored several studies on ways of increasing both the functions, resources&#13;
and capacity of the new RDCs. The Forum commissioned consultancy studies for: Road&#13;
Planning, Construction and Maintenance; District Health Provision; Education Service&#13;
Provision; Financing of RDCs; and a Strategic Plan for RDC Capacity Building.&#13;
2.04  The reports of most of these studies are still under discussion, although the&#13;
Strategic Plan for RDC Capacity Building has now been adopted by the government and&#13;
forms the basis upon which the current national RDC Capacity Building Program has&#13;
been designed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
2.05  The creation of a unified system of rural local authorities was formally achieved&#13;
in 1993 with the implementation of the RDC Act, five years after its promulgation. The&#13;
amalgamation of all the rural authorities into Rural District Councils signals an important&#13;
attempt to decentralize the system of governance, opening the door to a major shift in the&#13;
management and provision of local services in rural areas from central to local&#13;
government.&#13;
2.06  Each RDC falls within the territory of one Province. There are eight Provinces&#13;
with RDCs within them-- the ninth and tenth Provinces are special cases of the national&#13;
capital, Harare, and the second largest city in the country, Bulawayo, which have both&#13;
City Council and provincial status. Provinces are territorial jurisdictions of the Central&#13;
Government. Provincial Governors are appointed by the President, and each has a seat in&#13;
the national parliament. The provincial administrative structure includes offices of line&#13;
ministries, with these under the overall supervision of the Provincial Administrator who&#13;
is appointed by the Ministry of Local Government, Rural and Urban Development&#13;
(MLGRUD). Some line ministry offices extend down to the District level, and these are&#13;
supervised by the District Administrator, also appointed by the MLGRUD. The District&#13;
Administrator chairs the Rural District Development Committee (RDDC), and this&#13;
Committee is charged with the responsibility of preparing and monitoring annual and&#13;
long-term district development plans. The annual district development plan is approved&#13;
in a joint session of the RDDC and the RDC. Although the RDC holds a prominent&#13;
position in the RDDC, the RDDC also includes all district heads of sector ministries. At&#13;
present, there is some debate about the role of traditional leaders in the RDDC.&#13;
2.07  The RDC Act mandates a committee structure, and each council must have,&#13;
among others, a Ward Development Committee (WADCO) for each of the Wards&#13;
(generally about 20-40 wards per RDC). In turn, each WADCO has representation from&#13;
each Village Development Committee (VIDCO) within its jurisdiction. The WADCO is&#13;
responsible for preparing and submitting its ward development plan, incorporating&#13;
VIDCO and other interests, to its RDC. Finally, the RDC is responsible for consideration&#13;
of all ward plans, and preparation and implementation of district development plans.&#13;
These plans are the primary input of the RDCs into the annual district development plans&#13;
approved by the RDDC. I&#13;
B. Roles and Responsibilities of Rural District Councils (RDCs)&#13;
2.08  The RDC Act provides a legal basis for RDCs to assume responsibility for a&#13;
number of key service areas. These include: overall development planning, education,&#13;
I     Additional information on the planning and administrative structures of Provinces and&#13;
RDCs may be found in A. H. Helmsing, "Transforming Rural Local Government: Zimbabwe's&#13;
Postindependence Experience", Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy, Vol. 8&#13;
(1990), pp. 87-110 and in The World Bank, "Rural Community Infrastructure: Building on the&#13;
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program", Report No. 11096, June 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
health, water supply and sanitation, housing, roads and bridges, natural resource&#13;
management, commercial development, and urban land planning and management.&#13;
However, it is not yet possible to state precisely which functions RDCs will be&#13;
responsible for in the future as the division of roles and responsibilities between central&#13;
and local government is still being negotiated. The likelihood is that rural service&#13;
provision will continue to be the dual responsibility of central and local government.&#13;
Furthermore, even if RDCs take the lead for those functions listed above, many of them&#13;
lack the skills and resources required, giving added impetus to the formulation of a&#13;
national capacity building program.&#13;
2.09  The current capacity of RDCs to tackle the 64 tasks which the 1988 Act enables&#13;
them to undertake is extremely varied, reflecting the different human, financial and&#13;
physical resources inherited by RDCs from their predecessors. Moreover, the natural&#13;
resource and economic bases of the RDC areas are extremely heterogeneous. Therefore&#13;
needs, and the ability of RDCs to meet them, also vary significantly. However, on the&#13;
basis of evidence from field experience and consultancy studies, a number of key&#13;
weaknesses and gaps common to most RDCs can be identified. These can be classified&#13;
into two groups: first, financial and human resources, as well as lack of vehicles and&#13;
equipment; and second, organizational characteristics, involving leadership qualities and&#13;
the organization's sense of mission, management systems and structures, and the degree&#13;
of discipline, openness and accountability within the organization.&#13;
C. RDC Financing&#13;
2.10  The financial base for RDCs is currently as follows.&#13;
a) Central government grants which include a per capita grant from the&#13;
ministry of education, an expenditure grant from the ministry of health and a&#13;
small administration grant from MLGRUD. RDCs also receive small grants&#13;
from the Natural Resources Board for activities related to land conservation.&#13;
b) A range of local revenue sources including development levies, unit taxes,&#13;
license fees, service charges, beer levies, royalties and revenue from income&#13;
generating projects.&#13;
c) Various public sector programs channel capital investment funds to RDC&#13;
areas through sector ministries.&#13;
d) Various loans are available, including from the National Loans Fund, the&#13;
Central Rates Fund and the General Loans Fund, but these are not easily&#13;
accessed by most RDCs.&#13;
2.11  RDCs are generally dependent on government grants, although the picture is&#13;
variable. In some cases grants make up more than 60% of total RDC income, although in&#13;
most cases the figure is around 40%. Administration grants, on average, make up about&#13;
35% of RDC administration expenditure; education grants make up about 50-60% of&#13;
education expenditure while health grants make up almost 90% of health expenditure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
2.12  In recent years central government grants have decreased as a proportion of total&#13;
RDC income, implying an increased importance for local revenue. However, RDCs are&#13;
far from assuming fiscal autonomy and this situation will not change in the near future.&#13;
Fifty percent of RDCs surveyed for the Strategic Plan for Capacity Building had local&#13;
revenue of less that Z$3 million in 1993/94, and 56% did not have sufficient local&#13;
revenue to meet recurrent expenditure.&#13;
2.13  There are several reasons for this. First, the revenue raising powers available to&#13;
RDCs are limited in number and in terms of their revenue raising capacity, since most&#13;
significant powers rest with central government rather than local authorities. Second,&#13;
central government exerts considerable influence over the level of revenue raised by&#13;
RDCs. Third, many RDCs do not use their existing revenue raising powers as effectively&#13;
as they might due to poor understanding of their rights and poor financial management.&#13;
Finally, in many RDCs the scope for increasing local revenue is limited because of few&#13;
opportunities for economic development and therefore low levels of income for the&#13;
majority of the population.&#13;
2.14  RDCs should play a significant role in implementing capital development at&#13;
district level. A survey by the consultants engaged for the Strategic Plan for Capacity&#13;
Building found that in 1993-94, 19% of RDCs surveyed spent no money at all on capital&#13;
development while a further 43% spent less that Z$0.5 million. Furthermore, 36% of&#13;
RDCs spent no money on road maintenance while another 47% spent less than Z$ 1.0&#13;
million, and this includes RDCs with commercial wards where local authorities are&#13;
responsible for road maintenance.&#13;
2.15  This low level of capital expenditure is due to the fact that although funds for&#13;
RDCs are available from a number of sources, the amounts given tend to be very limited.&#13;
Most government and donor funds for capital projects, with the exception of some&#13;
Integrated Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (IRWSS) projects, are channeled through&#13;
line ministries rather than RDCs. Few RDCs have the resources necessary to fund capital&#13;
projects; indeed many cannot finance their own recurrent budgets. There is no access to&#13;
loan facilities, other than housing development loans which have sometimes been beyond&#13;
the capacity of poorer RDCs to repay. Some RDCs have been granted borrowing powers&#13;
by central government mainly for housing schemes at growth points, Rural Service&#13;
Centers or small towns. However, the majority of the RDCs have yet to qualify for these&#13;
loans.&#13;
D. Key Issues&#13;
2.16  The key issues confronting RDCs derive from two main sets of circumstances.&#13;
First, the reorganization of responsibilities and authority inherent in Government's&#13;
decentralization program present RDCs with a variety of ambiguities related to&#13;
manageable priorities for service delivery. Transfer of responsibilities and resources to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
RDCs and other levels of local government should be undertaken in accordance with a&#13;
coherent strategy founded upon a broad consensus. Government has taken significant&#13;
steps during the past 12 months to establish such a strategy, but the multiplicity of central&#13;
agencies involved in the decentralization process--and the obvious vested interests&#13;
inherent therein--necessarily entail a gradual approach to consensus building. Therefore,&#13;
a key factor in clearly defining a national decentralization strategy will be the degree to&#13;
which RDCs can accept new responsibilities and provide required services on a sustained&#13;
basis.&#13;
2.17  This raises the second set of key issues relating to RDCs' capacity to plan,&#13;
implement and manage delivery of infrastructure and services. In the general absence of&#13;
such capacity, consensus is unlikely to form among central agencies that meaningful&#13;
decentralization should be undertaken. On the other hand, the installation of such&#13;
capacity within RDCs in the absence of significant resources would be both a fruitless&#13;
and frustrating enterprise. Further, given the diversity of existing capacities and priorities&#13;
for local development among the country's RDCs, a monolithic approach to capacity&#13;
building would be inefficient and, in many cases, nonresponsive.&#13;
2.18  Thus, the key issues are to link tailored capacity building within RDCs with&#13;
access to resources in order to establish the strategic areas upon which a responsible&#13;
program of decentralization should focus. In turn, these efforts at the local level must&#13;
feed into the national consensus building process in order that transfer of central&#13;
responsibilities, authority and resources is carried out in a manner which will lead to&#13;
more equitable, sustained development.&#13;
E. Strategy for the Local Government Sector&#13;
2.19 MLGRUD and the Bank are in full concurrence as to the appropriate assistance&#13;
strategy, given the key issues as discussed above. This strategy explicitly recognizes that&#13;
RDCs are a key target for capacity building in support of the decentralization process, but&#13;
that continuing support to other local authorities must also be provided in order that the&#13;
entire local government sector is empowered to play its fullest, most efficient role in&#13;
promoting national development. For this reason the overall sectoral strategy emphasizes&#13;
coordinated support to all local governments in Zimbabwe, including capacity building,&#13;
access to capital resources and policy reform. The proposed RDC Pilot project will, as&#13;
explained in Chapter I, provide capital to complement capacity building over an initial&#13;
two year transitional period. During this period, the ongoing Urban II project will be&#13;
completed and the proposed Local Government Development Project (LGDP) will be&#13;
designed, with implementation initiated to provide continuing support to the entire local&#13;
government sector in Zimbabwe.&#13;
2.20 The proposed project would extend the Bank's involvement with Zimbabwean&#13;
local government to include the 57 Rural District Councils. This new and highly&#13;
complementary initiative will build upon the Bank's long track record of support to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
Urban Councils, beginning with the Urban I project (Loan 2445-ZIM, approved in June&#13;
1984) and continuing with the ongoing Urban II project (Loan 3079-ZIM), expected to be&#13;
closed in December 1998. A key lesson learned has been that Zimbabwe's local&#13;
governments have the initiative and capacity, given adequate support, to improve their&#13;
performances and assume increasing responsibilities as a key part of the decentralization&#13;
process.&#13;
2.21   The Government announced a significant and comprehensive decentralization&#13;
policy in July 1996. Under this policy, local governments--particularly RDCs--are to&#13;
gradually receive significant additional infrastructure and service delivery&#13;
responsibilities, as well as additional financing responsibilities. Although the&#13;
Government's policy statement represents a consensus across all ministries on&#13;
decentralization policy objectives and principles, implementation details remain to be&#13;
worked out. A key element of the Bank's assistance is support to implementation of the&#13;
policy, ensuring that international experience is brought to the benefit of Zimbabwe's&#13;
decentralization process.&#13;
2.22  In summary, the strategy for the local government sector is to build on lessons&#13;
learned from past and on-going initiatives, to support the Government in its sensible&#13;
decentralization policy, and to initiate a new series of projects. This series would be&#13;
initiated by the proposed RDC Pilot and followed by the LGDP. The strategy is designed&#13;
to support (i) policies agreed with the Government, (ii) local government strengthening,&#13;
and (iii) the sustainability, efficiency and equity of infrastructure and services&#13;
increasingly under the responsibility of local governments.&#13;
F. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.23  Without the institutional and financial capacities to absorb new responsibilities at&#13;
the local level, decentralization initiatives may be inefficient from the perspective of&#13;
service delivery, as well as potentially destabilizing during a period of fiscal&#13;
retrenchment. The proposed project would provide an opportunity for the Bank to support&#13;
not only RDC capacity building and infrastructure financing, but also to contribute to the&#13;
dialogue on decentralization and intergovernmental fiscal policy across sectors and&#13;
between levels of government in the context of fiscal sustainability.&#13;
2.24 Government already has launched the RDC Capacity Building Program and is&#13;
committed to its expansion. The effort has attracted significant donor support (UJNDP,&#13;
UK, Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark), and the Bank has been invited to participate in&#13;
an on-going effort. The Bank's support to the program is viewed widely as critical to its&#13;
success, primarily for two reasons: (a) to provide investment funding as an incentive for&#13;
institutional and human resource strengthening (financed by other donors) on a broad and&#13;
substantial scale; and (b) to bring international best practices to the policy dialogue on&#13;
decentralization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
2.25  Given both its long-standing involvement with local governments in Zimbabwe&#13;
and its broad experience in supporting decentralization throughout the developing world,&#13;
the Bank is uniquely positioned to play a catalytic role in supporting the emerging&#13;
decentralization process in Zimbabwe. The commitment of substantial bilateral support&#13;
for "soft" capacity building activities will allow Bank funding to be focused upon its&#13;
most appropriate application: capital investments. At the same time, the wealth of Bank&#13;
experience in comparable decentralization exercises will assist Government in&#13;
winnowing out the most efficient courses to be followed in defining Zimbabwe's way&#13;
forward. In short, the combination in Zimbabwe of central government commitment,&#13;
local authority willingness, bilateral support and clear focus for application of Bank&#13;
resources presents a strong rationale for Bank involvement.&#13;
G. Linkages to the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)&#13;
2.26  The 1994 CAS focused on four basic areas, including infrastructure to support&#13;
growth and expand economic participation, and human resource investment and capacity&#13;
building. The proposed project would support capacity building and infrastructure&#13;
financing in the newly formed RDCs and is thus clearly consistent with the current CAS.&#13;
A new CAS is to be presented to the Board in late May 1997. The new CAS calls for&#13;
more selective support of the Government's development goals. One of the key features&#13;
of the assistance strategy is greater use of pilot operations and adaptable project designs.&#13;
The proposed project is a strong example of this, a pilot project incorporating innovative&#13;
procedures to facilitate disbursements and promote learning-by-doing which will provide&#13;
the Government with important lessons in the process of decentralization. The new CAS&#13;
also highlights areas of focus for Bank efforts, including rural development and the&#13;
development of human capital, both of which are supported in the proposed project.&#13;
III. THE RDCCBP PROGRAM AND THE RDC PILOT PROJECT&#13;
A. Program Origin and Participatory Design Process&#13;
3.01  The RDCCBP is a direct outgrowth of an extensive series of policy reforms,&#13;
analyses, and pilot projects undertaken in Zimbabwe over the last seven years following&#13;
issuance of the 1988 Rural District Councils Act. At the core of these actions has been&#13;
the incremental approach taken by GoZ in articulating its decentralization policy which,&#13;
for the rural sector, found particular focus through the Forum for Rural Development.&#13;
3.02  This Forum, which operated during the period 1991-94 under the leadership of&#13;
MLGRUD with SIDA and Ford Foundation support, examined key areas in which RDC&#13;
capacities and functions could be manageably expanded. Studies were undertaken in:&#13;
a) Road planning, construction and maintenance;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
b) District health provision;&#13;
c) Education service provision;&#13;
d) Financing RDCs; and&#13;
e) Strategic planning for RDC capacity building&#13;
3.03  MLGRUD complemented these policy studies with the initiation of the Pilot&#13;
District Support Project (PDSP) in 1989 with ODA support in the Midlands province.&#13;
The explicit purpose of PDSP was to test the degree to and pace at which improvements&#13;
could be achieved in RDCs' capacity to plan, implement and manage infrastructure and&#13;
service delivery. PDSP was, by 1994, judged to be a conspicuous success with the two&#13;
pilot RDCs developing the capacity to successfully implement 69 infrastructure projects&#13;
worth about US$820,000. Projects ranged from shallow wells valued on average at less&#13;
than US$1,000 to district clinics requiring more than US$30,000 in capital investment.&#13;
Under this project the RDCs worked successfully through a variety of implementing&#13;
arrangements, including community-led initiatives, contracting out, force account, and&#13;
implementation through line agencies. PDSP placed significant emphasis upon planning&#13;
to achieve sustainable investments, with the result that in mid- 1996 all 69 of the&#13;
infrastructure projects funded under the project were in operation and being maintained&#13;
typically through contributions from the RDC and local residents.&#13;
3.04  With full amalgamation of all RDCs in 1993 and building upon the successful&#13;
pilot project, MLGRUD has now moved to expand capacity building to include all RDCs&#13;
in the country. Under the umbrella of the interministerial Capacity Building&#13;
Coordinating Committee (CBCC), bilateral donors have demonstrated exemplary&#13;
coordination in providing two years of support to the Capacity Building Unit (CBU) in&#13;
MLGRUD which has carried out a systematic process of consultation with all RDCs and&#13;
Provinces in designing the RDCCBP.&#13;
B. Objectives&#13;
3.05 Within the context of government's overall decentralization program, the&#13;
objective of the RDCCBP is to develop the capacity of all RDCs to plan, implement and&#13;
manage the sustainable delivery of essential services. To achieve this objective, the&#13;
program is explicitly designed to support learning by doing through the combined&#13;
provision of institutional development support, human resources development inputs,&#13;
and capital and material resources necessary to directly implement infrastructure and&#13;
deliver services.&#13;
3.06  With the recently completed amalgamation of Zimbabwe's 57 RDCs, there exists&#13;
for the first time in the country's history a complete framework of accountable,&#13;
representative local authorities.2 This historic juncture presents Zimbabwe's first realistic&#13;
2     In addition to the RDCs, the local government system includes, in ascending order of&#13;
complexity and authority, Town, Municipal and City Councils.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
opportunity to pursue a comprehensive decentralization agenda, and the RDCCBP is&#13;
designed to support this agenda by focusing its assistance as directly as possible on the&#13;
RDCs with Provincial level oversight. Ministerial input will, in turn, be focused on&#13;
overall program management and policy reform.&#13;
3.07  Given the wide variance of human, financial and material resources existing in the&#13;
RDCs, the program is designed to promote significant capacity improvement in all RDCs&#13;
over the course of the RDCCBP (see Key Performance Indicators of Annex 1). As a way&#13;
to "level the playing field" all RDCs will receive equal amounts of District Development&#13;
Grants over the first two years of RDCCBP implementation (see Section C below).&#13;
Thereafter, performance evaluations and poverty indicators will influence the magnitude&#13;
of block grants available to councils, setting the stage for broader intergovernmental&#13;
fiscal reform.&#13;
3.08  Key outputs expected under the program include:&#13;
a) improved RDC planning, appraisal, implementation and technical supervision&#13;
capacity;&#13;
b) improved financial management and accountability;&#13;
c) enhanced financial positions including improved local revenue generation;&#13;
d) increased community participation in planning, implementation and management&#13;
of development activities;&#13;
e) improved provision and maintenance of economic and social infrastructure, and&#13;
associated poverty reduction;&#13;
f) enhanced public transparency and accountability of councilors and officials; and&#13;
g) lessons leading to increased public/private partnerships in funding, implementing&#13;
and managing infrastructure and service provision.&#13;
3.09 It must be emphasized that the overall program philosophy is one of learning by&#13;
doing. This philosophy inherently assumes that mistakes will be made, analyzed and&#13;
rectified to the ultimate benefit of participating RDCs and their constituents. While&#13;
experience gained from previous projects such as PDSP and the Bank-assisted Urban I&#13;
and II will clearly be of assistance in guiding RDCCBP implementation, the RDCs&#13;
themselves will be entering uncharted waters in many respects and unforeseen outcomes&#13;
are to be anticipated.&#13;
C. Program Description&#13;
3.10  The entire RDCCBP is described below, although initial Bank financing will be&#13;
limited to a portion of the capital financing required during the two years of&#13;
implementation corresponding to GoZ financial years 97/98 and 1999.3 The program&#13;
3     The Government of Zimbabwe has changed its designation of the fiscal year from July-&#13;
June, to the calendar year. The transition will be made by extending the fiscal year 97/98 to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
consists of the i) institutional and ii) human resources development components&#13;
complemented by iii) the capital development component. The component financing&#13;
amounts presented in parentheses estimate the entire financing requirement for the&#13;
RDCCBP, including local counterpart, bi-lateral donors and the World Bank.&#13;
Institutional Development Component (US$ 17.04 million)&#13;
3.11  The institutional development component of the program will support&#13;
improvements in the capacities of RDCs to plan and sustain priority services and facilities&#13;
in response to the demands of the more than 8 million Zimbabweans resident in RDC&#13;
jurisdictions. This component, full funding for which has already been approved by&#13;
ODA, will fund 215 person years of Zimbabwean consultancy input, 34 person years of&#13;
expatriate input, studies and equipment acquisition.&#13;
3.12  Provincial Support Teams (PSTs) have been deployed for five years beginning in&#13;
October 1996 in all eight of the provinces that include RDCs. PSTs will support the&#13;
legally mandated Provincial Development Committees, and they will consist of a team&#13;
leader and, on average, four facilitators with each facilitator servicing about two RDCs.&#13;
The PSTs will work with RDC and provincial staff to facilitate improvements in&#13;
planning, implementation and management processes. Each PST will, for the first three&#13;
years, include one expatriate organizational development specialist, and the PSTs, in the&#13;
course of the learning by doing process, will identify specific human resource weaknesses&#13;
to be addressed through the human resources development component.&#13;
3.13  Support will also be provided to the Capacity Building Unit (CBU) for five years.&#13;
The CBU, located in MLGRUD and reporting to the CBCC, provides overall program&#13;
coordination and management. Two additional expatriate advisors will be attached to the&#13;
CBU to assist in these tasks.&#13;
3.14 This component of the program will also finance acquisition of basic equipment&#13;
necessary for particularly the most disadvantaged RDCs to achieve a minimum&#13;
acceptable level of logistical capacity. Funding is also available for consultancy inputs in&#13;
preparation of the proposed Local Governnent Development Project, including a&#13;
beneficiary assessment of Urban II to ensure that lessons learned under that project are&#13;
incorporated in future project designs.&#13;
3.15  Finally, this component includes financing for a baseline and longitudinal impact&#13;
assessment which will be managed by UNDP. This assessment will monitor&#13;
improvements in RDC planning, management and finance as well as impact of capital&#13;
investments.&#13;
1 8-month period July 1997 - December 1998. Beginning in 1999, the fiscal year will coincide&#13;
with the calendar year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
Human Resources Development Component (US$ 4.12 million)&#13;
3.16  This program component is designed to build capacity to provide continuing&#13;
human resource development assistance to RDCs and to respond to specific needs arising&#13;
in the RDCCBP implementation process. In MLGRUD assistance will focus upon the&#13;
Manpower Development Section of the Department of Local Authorities Administration.&#13;
Key activities will include development of a clear RDC Training Policy, establishment of&#13;
a training needs data base, liaison with other ministries and national training institutions,&#13;
support to provincial and district training officers and establishment of staff development&#13;
systems.&#13;
3.17  At the Provincial level this component will assist capacity development of&#13;
Provincial Manpower Development and Training Officers and support formation of&#13;
Provincial Training Teams to deliver basic skills and functional training courses for&#13;
RDCs. These teams will work in close coordination with the PSTs.&#13;
3.18  At the District level this component will identify basic needs and supply required&#13;
training including Training of Trainers for District Training Teams. At the Sub-district&#13;
level the component will promote the formation of local networks including government,&#13;
local government and NGOs to promote community participation in the planning,&#13;
delivery and maintenance of local development projects. This aspect of the component&#13;
will require close coordination with the proposed Community Development Project to be&#13;
implemented, with BANK assistance, under the country's Poverty Alleviation Action&#13;
Plan.&#13;
3.19  Agreement is expected to be reached with SIDA for funding of this component in&#13;
the second quarter of CY 1997, with implementation to begin soon thereafter.&#13;
Capital Development Component (US$75.59 million)&#13;
3.20 The Capital Development Component is designed to a) provide all 57 RDCs with&#13;
access to grant funds necessary to reequip and reinitiate critical service and infrastructure&#13;
provision and b) create incentives for improved RDC performance. This component is&#13;
critical to ensure that capacity is not built in a resource vacuum, and that RDCs are able&#13;
to maximize their learning by doing experiences through actual project implementation.4&#13;
4     The British Overseas Development Administration (ODA) has provided considerable&#13;
support for the design of the Capital Development Component. Under the Memorandum. of&#13;
Understanding, dated February 7, 1996, between the British Development Division for Central&#13;
Africa and the Bank's identification mission for the RDC Pilot and the LGDP, ODA has&#13;
supported component design consultancies by Conyers and Hlatshwayo and by Gunby (noted&#13;
below), as well as an international consultancy for an evaluation of the Urban II implementation&#13;
with a view to improving future support to local government. This evaluation includes the&#13;
project's impact on implementation institutions, both of the central Ministries and Urban&#13;
Councils, and a beneficiary assessment among beneficiary households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
The component consists of two types of capital assistance (grants and loans) and of&#13;
technical assistance for implementation of the Government's decentralization policy. Of&#13;
the US$ 75.59 million financing requirement estimated for this component under the&#13;
entire RDCCBP, US$ 19.75 would be provided under the RDC Pilot, with the&#13;
Governments of Sweden and the Netherlands expected to provide US$ 7 million (para&#13;
4.01). The remaining financing for the last three years of this Component's&#13;
implementation (US$ 55.84 million) is expected to be obtained under the Local&#13;
Government Development Project (see Sections E and F below).&#13;
3.21  District Development Grants (DDGs, US$ 47.59 million) will provide each of&#13;
the 57 RDCs with up to US$ 0.25 million for each of the first two years of the project&#13;
(GoZ FY 1997/98 and 19995) for productive investments in equipment and&#13;
infrastructure.6 Access to these block grants will be predicated upon RDCs' submission&#13;
of approved development plans and engagement of qualified senior officials. Beginning&#13;
in FY2000, performance criteria, to be agreed during the first two years of&#13;
implementation, will be brought into play to determine the level of block grants each&#13;
RDC will receive. This innovation will feed into the process, to be pursued more directly&#13;
under the proposed LGDP. of establishing an equitable and sustainable revenue sharing&#13;
system (including block grants based on RDC poverty levels and own-source revenue&#13;
potential) to promote Government's decentralization objectives.&#13;
3.22  The anticipated level of funding required for DDGs over the five year life of&#13;
RDCCBP has been detailed in a consultancy report commissioned by MLGRUD with&#13;
ODA support (Conyers and Hlatshwayo, 1996). This report estimated three scenarios&#13;
under which RDCs' capacity to responsibly absorb DDGs would occur. The scenario&#13;
related to a medium level of performance improvements is summarized below:&#13;
Medium Performance Scenario (Z$ m)&#13;
Year        Avg. per RDC             Total&#13;
1                1.0                57.00&#13;
2                1.5                 85.50&#13;
3                1.341               50.76&#13;
4                1.877               71.05&#13;
5                2.627              99.47&#13;
Total              8.345             475.65&#13;
5     The Government of Zimbabwe has changed its designation of the fiscal year from July-&#13;
June, to the calendar year. The transition will be made by extending the fiscal year 97/98 to the&#13;
18-month period July 1997 - December 1998. Beginning in 1999, the fiscal year will coincide&#13;
with the calendar year.&#13;
6     The value of DDGs expressed in Zimbabwe dollars will depend on the relative&#13;
currency exchange rates of the ITF Credit, Swiss Kroners and Dutch Gilders. For&#13;
planning purposes, this "basket" of financing is assumed to result in an "average"&#13;
exchange rate of US$ 1.0 = Z$ 10.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
3.23  A second report sought to establish the priority areas for investment by RDCs of&#13;
the proceeds from DDGs (Gunby, 1996). This study utilized questionnaires to determine&#13;
the top three priorities of RDCs for transfer of functional responsibilities, as summarized&#13;
below:&#13;
Function                    % of RDCs&#13;
Roads                          56.6&#13;
Water and Sanitation           53.3&#13;
Health                         33.3&#13;
Education                      20.0&#13;
Income Generation              16.6&#13;
Physical Planning              13.3&#13;
Land Acquisition               13.1&#13;
Financial Management           10.0&#13;
Housing Construction           10.0&#13;
3.24  The emphasis of RDCs upon functional control over and increased investments in&#13;
roads and water related infrastructure is reflected in reported RDC priorities for&#13;
utilization of DDGs. A high percentage of DDG investments, at least in the first years of&#13;
RDCCBP, is expected to be devoted to acquisition of maintenance equipment,&#13;
particularly in RDCs which did not inherit significant stocks of equipment from pre-&#13;
amalgamation Rural Councils.&#13;
3.25  The balance of DDG investments is likely to be mainly devoted to small scale&#13;
infrastructure and rehabilitation of existing social facilities. In addition, each RDC will&#13;
be required to devote at least 10 percent of each annual DDG to community based&#13;
projects, in conjunction with the Human Resources Development Component's focus&#13;
upon sub-district community planning and mobilization.&#13;
3.26  All aspects of DDG operations will be codified in the Project's Operational&#13;
Manual. Adoption of the final version of this manual will be a condition of credit&#13;
effectiveness, and the manual will be incorporated by reference in the credit agreement&#13;
3.27  District Development Loans (DDLs, US$ 27.50 million) are the second&#13;
financing mechanism included in the Capital Development Component of the program.&#13;
The DDLs have been designed to meet the needs of the more efficiently managed RDCs&#13;
which already have demonstrated capacity to manage loans and require larger amounts of&#13;
development capital than are available through the DDGs.&#13;
3.28  The Conyers and Hlatshwayo study estimates that 17 RDCs are currently&#13;
"bankable" in terms of financial management capacity, revenue bases, prior experience&#13;
with borrowing and several other relevant criteria. Surveys of these RDCs indicate a high&#13;
demand for loan funding over the life of RDCCBP, as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
Estimated Loan Requirements of Currently Bankable RDCs (Z$ m)&#13;
97/98 1999  2000  2001  2002         Total&#13;
91.8  59.5  52.7  98.6  44.2         346.8&#13;
The high year one demand for loans again reflects the need for RDCs to replenish their&#13;
seriously depleted stocks of maintenance equipment.&#13;
3.29  Given the capacity building objective of RDCCBP it is important to include a&#13;
lending facility in the project. The overall decentralization objectives of Government&#13;
correctly emphasize that all local authorities in the country must begin to mobilize&#13;
additional sources of finance for local infrastructure development and service delivery.&#13;
However, the emphasis on learning by doing in RDCCBP indicates that a gradual&#13;
approach to RDC borrowing will be prudent, allowing time to ensure that credit&#13;
management capacity is well developed.&#13;
3.30  Therefore, the Capital Development Component will include a relatively modest&#13;
provision of US$ 4.5 million for lending to bankable RDCs in the first two years of&#13;
program operation. Performance will be carefully monitored and lessons learned will be&#13;
incorporated in the proposed LGDP design.&#13;
3.31  The procedures governing lending under RDCCBP will build upon systems&#13;
established within MLGRUD as part of the Urban II Project including the standard&#13;
borrowing capacity and project appraisal procedures and documentation. Lending will&#13;
follow terms established for the Public Sector Investment Program (as agreed under the&#13;
Urban II Project), with repayment periods not exceeding: 12 years for plant and&#13;
equipment; 25 years for infrastructure; and, 30 years for community facilities. The&#13;
onlending rate shall correspond to the rate established for Public Sector Investment&#13;
Program loans, which, at mid-1996, was 13.5% p.a. (para. 4.01). The procedures for&#13;
lending under the RDC Pilot will be regulated in the Project Operational Manual that also&#13;
applies to DDGs, with the important addition of the borrowing capacity analysis and&#13;
documentation. This manual will be finalized and agreed with the Bank as a condition of&#13;
credit effectiveness (para. 4.42).&#13;
3.32  Decentralization Policy Support (US$ 0.50 million). This element of the Capital&#13;
Development Component will support, over the first two years of RDCCBP operations,&#13;
development of critical policies required to sustain implementation of Government's&#13;
decentralization agenda. The support would be channeled to the existing CBU and would&#13;
address the agenda defined in the Government's Decentralization Policy Letter (see&#13;
Annex 6). Response to this agenda will focus largely upon three key areas, to be&#13;
addressed at a mid-term review to be held not later than October 31, 1998.&#13;
3.33 First, international experience in successful (and unsuccessful) intergovernmental&#13;
fiscal reform will be examined (through workshops and strategic consultant inputs) and&#13;
strategies will be identified for potential application in the Zimbabwean context. A key&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
area of concern will be the development of revenue sharing mechanisms which wean&#13;
local authorities from dependence on central budgetary support over time while taking&#13;
into account equity and incentives for improved performance. Proposals will be&#13;
examined and agreed as part of the proposed LGDP design process.&#13;
3.34 Second, other areas of intergovernmental relations of importance to fostering local&#13;
authority autonomy will also be examined. Particular emphasis will be placed upon--&#13;
again, in line with stated Government policy--opportunities for increasing private sector&#13;
participation in the financing and provision of key services and infrastructure. Other key&#13;
areas will include improved utilization of state lands and other centrally owned assets in&#13;
local authority jurisdictions and the critical relationship between bulk and retail water&#13;
supply.&#13;
3.35  Finally, close monitoring of the RDC Pilot implementation process for RDC&#13;
investment financing will be undertaken. This monitoring will include compliance with&#13;
the process arrangements agreed with the Bank through the Project Operational Manual,&#13;
as well as financial audits for all project accounts for fiscal years 1997/98 and 1999.&#13;
Details are provided in paras 3.59-3.60 and in Annex 7.&#13;
D. RDCCBP Program Implementation&#13;
3.36 To achieve maximum benefit, the program's key components must be&#13;
implemented in a highly coordinated manner, and the management structures to achieve&#13;
this goal are well established, very well staffed and highly experienced. Figure 1&#13;
demonstrates the program management structure. The CBU has been in place and&#13;
functioning for two years and five years of continuing support are already assured&#13;
through ODA.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
3.37  Recruitment of provincial support teams has been completed and the PSTs have&#13;
been in place since October 1996. Bilateral support for the HRD component is expected&#13;
to be finalized in mid-CY97 with fielding of all key staff expected soon thereafter. All&#13;
provincial level development committees are well established. A few of the 57 RDCs are&#13;
still recruiting key professional staff and MLGRUD expects that all necessary&#13;
appointments will be finalized by mid-CY97. Sub-district structures are also fully&#13;
established in RDCs. Figure 2 charts the key RDCCBP organizational relationships at&#13;
the provincial, district and sub-district levels. Annex 2 summarizes the project&#13;
implementation schedule. The draft table of contents for the Project Implementation&#13;
Manual is provided in Annex 5.&#13;

3.38  The program's monitoring and evaluation system has been well designed and is&#13;
summarized in Figure 3. The Provincial Development Committees, with support from the&#13;
PSTs, will monitor RDC activities on a continuing basis. Formal semi-annual reports&#13;
from RDCs to provinces will summarize progress made and problems encountered. The&#13;
CBU will assemble all monitoring inputs at the national level and annual reviews&#13;
including all participating donors will be carried out by the CBCC. Key performance&#13;
indicators are summarized in Annex 1.&#13;
3.39  SIDA support has been arranged for the placement of a local government project&#13;
development facilitator in the Harare resident mission. This local consultant assumed her&#13;
duties in January 1997 for a two year period. Among other responsibilities, the facilitator&#13;
will utilize RDCCBP monitoring outputs to produce a complementary assessment of the&#13;
impact of the Capital Development Component of the project which will receive Bank&#13;
support.&#13;
3.40 Finally, ODA has provided funding for a UNDP-managed baseline and&#13;
longitudinal project assessment activity. This contract was awarded in November 1996&#13;
and will be in place for the duration of the project.&#13;
Project Operational Manual&#13;
3.41  Administration and financial management manuals for all RDCs have been in use&#13;
for several years. Bank review of these documents has established that they are well&#13;
conceived and thorough.&#13;
3.42  Preparation of the Project Operational Manual governing the Capital&#13;
Development Component of RDCCBP implementation is well advanced. It will provide&#13;
specific eligibility criteria to receive District Development Grants and Loans, project&#13;
identification and appraisal procedures, procurement, disbursement and implementation&#13;
guidelines, and monitoring and evaluation processes. Regarding District Development&#13;
Loans, the Manual will include the standard borrowing capacity appraisal procedures and&#13;
onlending terms and conditions which have been developed under the Urban II Project.&#13;
The full content of the Manual was agreed at negotiations, and it will be incorporated by&#13;
reference in the Credit Agreement. The Project Operational Manual will be finalized and&#13;
agreed with the Bank, and its adoption, along with the Project Implementation Manual,&#13;
will be as a condition of credit effectiveness (para. 4.02).&#13;
E. RDCCBP Program Costs&#13;
3.43  The total program cost is estimated at US$96.75 million including all&#13;
contingencies, as summarized in Table 1 below. Cost estimates for the institutional&#13;
development component are drawn from the approved ODA financing plan for this&#13;
component. Estimates for the HRD component are drawn from the final project proposal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
and may, therefore, be subject to slight adjustments when the bilateral support agreement&#13;
for this component is finalized.&#13;
3.44  Estimates for the DDG element of the capital development component are, for the&#13;
first two years, based upon Z$2.5 million for each of the 57 councils. For years three&#13;
through five, the DDG costs reflect assumptions related to imposition of performance&#13;
criteria. For the loan element of this component, annual figures have been derived by&#13;
making cautious assumptions related to the absorptive capacity of RDCs versus expressed&#13;
demand. Cost estimates for years three through five for both the grant and loan elements&#13;
will be revised based upon experience and incorporated in the proposed LGDP.&#13;
3.45  Bank financing under the program will, at least for the first two years, be limited&#13;
to the capital development component. In years one and two the Bank will finance a&#13;
portion of the DDGs, all of the DDLs, and the decentralization policy support item under&#13;
this component.&#13;

F. RDC Pilot Financing Plan&#13;
3.46  The financing plan for the first two years of the capital development component is&#13;
presented in Table 2. It is assumed that partial funding for years three through five of the&#13;
capital development component of the RDCCBP will also be provided by the Bank&#13;
through the proposed LGDP.&#13;
3.47 The proceeds of the US$ 12.25 million Interim Fund credit for the RDC Pilot&#13;
Project would be made available to Government on standard IDA terms, for a period of&#13;
40 years, including 10 years grace. US$ 11.75 million or about 96 percent of the credit&#13;
would be passed on by Government to the RDCs as DDGs and DDLs. Repayment of&#13;
DDLs will follow standards established under Urban II (see para. 3.31), and incorporated&#13;
in the Project Operational Manual. The MLGRUD would provide evidence to the Bank&#13;
that the RDCs are effectively committed to the objectives and procedures of the&#13;
RDCCBP (with expression of this commitment through a Program Participation&#13;
Agreement). Participation Agreements between the MLGRUD and not less than ten&#13;
RDCs should be duly executed as a condition of effectiveness (para. 4.02). The balance of&#13;
US$ 0.50 million will be allocated to MLGRUD for decentralization policy support and&#13;
monitoring of the implementation of the capital development component.&#13;

G. Project Disbursements&#13;
3.48  The disbursement methodology to be adopted will play a key role in promoting&#13;
the program's capacity building and decentralization objectives, and in setting the stage&#13;
for broader reforms in the proposed LGDP. An essential element of Government's stated&#13;
decentralization policy is movement of public investment decision making and&#13;
management to the lowest appropriate levels in the country's political and administrative&#13;
apparatus. The RDC Act provides the legislated basis for RDCs to plan and execute a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
wide variety of local public investments. Only through actual management of&#13;
procurement and disbursement will the RDCs develop real capacity to responsibly deploy&#13;
resources at the local level. However, the major constraint upon development of this&#13;
capacity has been the absence, in all but a few RDCs, of significant capital finance.&#13;
3.49  Therefore, disbursements for financing RDC investments in civil works and goods&#13;
will be made to Government against certification by the MLGRUD that (a) all&#13;
participating RDCs have annual investment plans appraised according to the Project&#13;
Operational Manual agreed with the Bank, and (b) the Government has approved the&#13;
project investment financing (District Development Grants and Loans) included in the&#13;
annual investment plans. In the case of District Development Loans, the certification by&#13;
the MLGRUD also should include the provisions that beneficiary RDCs have (a)&#13;
undertaken successfully the borrowing capacity assessment procedures developed under&#13;
the Urban II Project, and (b) deposited 10 percent of the total investment financing&#13;
requirement in the RDC Project Account.&#13;
3.50  Disbursement and withdrawal procedures are detailed in the World Bank&#13;
Disbursement Handbook (1992 edition). All disbursements will be in accordance with the&#13;
Development Credit Agreement, and all procedures defined in the Disbursement Letter.&#13;
The specific flow of funds will be as follows: Funds intended for District Development&#13;
Grants (DDGs) will, at the request of the Ministry of Finance, be disbursed from the&#13;
Bank's Interim Fund (IF) Credit Account against fully appraised and approved DDG&#13;
project proposals drawn from each RDC's approved investment implementation plan.&#13;
The funds, in Zimbabwe dollars, will be transferred directly into a DDG Project Account&#13;
at the Ministry of Local Government, Rural and Urban Development (MLGRUD).&#13;
MLGRUD and the Ministry of Finance (MoF) will be notified of all such transfers.&#13;
Cofinancing funds from SIDA and the Dutch Government will also be deposited directly&#13;
into the same MLGRUD DDG Project Account, at which point the funds will be&#13;
commingled. MLGRUD will then disburse from the DDG Project Account into DDG&#13;
Capital Development Accounts set up by the eligible RDCs. The RDCs would then&#13;
disburse from the DDG Capital Development Accounts into DDG Operational Accounts&#13;
for implementation of specific projects. Disbursements from the Bank's IF Credit&#13;
Account into the DDG Project Account at the MLGRUD are anticipated to be made at the&#13;
beginning of each fiscal year (July 1997 and January 1999). Under exceptional&#13;
circumstances where appraisals for some sub-projects are incomplete at those times,&#13;
further disbursements could be made from time to time upon presentation of completed&#13;
appraisal and implementation plans. Additional disbursements will be clustered to&#13;
minimize the total number of annual disbursements, not intended to exceed three.&#13;
3.51  Funds intended for District Development Loans (DDLs) and consultancy&#13;
services will be disbursed from the Bank's IF Credit Account into a Special Account&#13;
established by the Ministry of Finance. At effectiveness, MLGRUD will submit a&#13;
withdrawal application to request US$ 500,000 to be deposited into the Special Account.&#13;
After a total of the equivalent of SDR 1.0 million has been disbursed from the Special&#13;
Account (approximately two full replenishments of the Special Account) the limit of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
Special Account will be raised to US$ 1.0 million. Replenishment of the Special&#13;
Account at the MoF will be made upon evidence of DDL approvals and disbursements&#13;
from the DDL Project Account at the MLGRUD. Statements of loan expenditures will&#13;
not be required for replenishment of the Special Account. They will, however, be&#13;
required for project supervision and auditing. Upon request by MLGRUD, the MoF will&#13;
disburse funds from the Special Account, in Zimbabwe dollars, into a DDL Project&#13;
Account at the MLGRUD. For financing of Decentralization Policy Support, MLGRUD&#13;
will disburse directly from the DDL Project Account for consultancy services. To&#13;
finance DDLs, the MLGRUD will disburse from the DDL Project Account into DDL&#13;
Capital Development Accounts set up by the eligible RDC's. The RDCs will then&#13;
disburse from the DDL Capital Development Accounts into DDL Operational Accounts&#13;
for implementation of specific projects.&#13;
3.52  Experience gained during the two year period of disbursements to be financed&#13;
through the credit will inform design of the proposed LGDP. Successful implementation&#13;
of this disbursement method is expected to support Government's intentions to gradually&#13;
reallocate resources from line ministries to local authorities through block grants for&#13;
reasonable local expenditure purposes.&#13;
3.53  The estimated disbursement schedule is presented in Table 3. All expenditures&#13;
eligible for Bank financing are net of taxes and duties. Currently, RDCs are exempt from&#13;
payment of taxes and duties for expenditures financed by international development&#13;
assistance institutions.&#13;

3.54  No retroactive financing will be required. Assuming that credit effectiveness will&#13;
be achieved by June 1997, the project completion date would be December 1999 and the&#13;
closing date would be June 2000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
H. Procurement&#13;
3.55  Procurement of equipment and civil works under the project will be specified in&#13;
the Project Operational Manual and will conform with MLGRUD's procurement&#13;
requirements for RDCs and with Interim Fund/World Bank guidelines. These procedures&#13;
have been used during implementation of the Urban II Project and have been satisfactory.&#13;
RDC investments to be financed under the project will be relatively small. Under the&#13;
DDG element of the capital development component no single procurement action by&#13;
RDCs is expected to exceed US$250,000 (equivalent to the maximum annual grant&#13;
value). Under the DDL element of this component no single procurement action will&#13;
exceed US$500,000 (the maximum amount any single RDC will be eligible to borrow in&#13;
the first two years) in value.&#13;
3.56  National shopping up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $570,000 equivalent,&#13;
may be utilized for procurement of goods up to US$ 30,000 in value, or such other lower&#13;
value as MLGRUD shall deem advisable. Works estimated to cost less than $20,000&#13;
equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $1,200,000 equivalent,&#13;
may be procured under lump-sum, fixed price contracts. Goods up to an aggregate&#13;
amount not to exceed $130,000 equivalent, and works, up to $350,000 equivalent in&#13;
aggregate, may be procured under community participation arrangements. Works that&#13;
meet the requirements of paragraph 3.8 of the Procurement Guidelines, and costing&#13;
$3,500,000 equivalent or less in aggregate, may be carried out by Force Account.&#13;
National competitive bidding will be required for procurement of goods estimated to cost&#13;
less than $250,000 equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed&#13;
$3,700,000 equivalent, and of works estimated to cost less than $ 1,000,000 equivalent per&#13;
contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $2,800,000 equivalent. Standard&#13;
Bidding Documents approved for use in the Urban II Project should be included in the&#13;
Project Implementation Manual. Procurement of (a) works valued in excess of US$1&#13;
million and (b) goods valued in excess of US$ 250,000 will be carried out in accordance&#13;
with standard Interim Fund/World Bank international competitive bidding procedures in&#13;
the unlikely event (e.g., pooling of equipment purchases by several RDCs, into a single&#13;
procurement at the provincial level) that these values are exceeded.&#13;
3.57 Management of the procurement process for eligible RDC civil works and goods&#13;
will be the responsibility of RDCs with oversight from the PSTs and the CBU in&#13;
MLGRUD. The broad experience gained by the MLGRUD under implementation of the&#13;
Urban I and II projects will provide valuable support for this oversight function.&#13;
Procurement schedules for each RDC should be prepared as part of the investment&#13;
planning process to be approved by the MLGRUD in accordance with the Project&#13;
Operational Manual. Prior Bank review of contracts for goods and works will be limited&#13;
to those procured under international competitive bidding procedures if such cases&#13;
emerge during implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
3.58   Consultant services which may be financed by the Bank under the&#13;
decentralization policy support element (to be managed by the MLGRUD) of the Capital&#13;
Development Component will be under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank and&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's latest Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. The following&#13;
consultant contracts will be subject to prior Bank review in accordance with standard&#13;
practice: (a) contracts with firms or individuals costing, respectively, US$ 100,000 and&#13;
US$ 50,000 or more awarded on a competitive basis, (b) amendments to contracts not&#13;
originally reviewed but resulting in values higher than those specified in (a) above, (c) all&#13;
terms of reference, (d) assignments of a critical nature, and (e) single-source selection of&#13;
consulting firms.&#13;

Note: Figures in parentheses are the respective amounts financed by the Bank.&#13;
1. Accounts and Audits&#13;
3.59 All RDCs are required under the 1988 RDC Act to submit to the MLGRUD&#13;
independently audited statements of accounts within nine months after the conclusion of&#13;
each financial year. These audited accounts will identify the expenditures made under the&#13;
capital development component of the program in a manner satisfactory to the Bank. All&#13;
audits of the Special Account, the MLGRUD Project Account and all RDC Project&#13;
Accounts will be performed by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
3.60   Considering the decentralized arrangements for project implementation&#13;
(consistent with project objectives) the project also will require audits of implementation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
performance, including: assessments of investment impact; RDC management&#13;
performance; RDC and financial accountability; and CBU financial management&#13;
performance. Details are provided in Annex 7. These expanded performance audits are&#13;
expected to promote not only the due diligence requirements of the Government and the&#13;
Bank, but also the "learning by doing" objective of the project through comprehensive&#13;
monitoring of procedures and results so that best practices may be disseminated, and&#13;
mistakes may be quickly identified and corrected. Full Bank financing of these audits&#13;
(including travel expenses related to them) is provided under the Decentralized Policy&#13;
Support element of the Capital Development Component and included under Consulting&#13;
Services in the procurement table. A formal stock-taking of project performance will&#13;
take place at a midterm review to be held not later than October 31, 1998.&#13;
J. Economic and Financial Analysis&#13;
3.61  The project is expected to benefit all 57 of the newly-formed RDCs through: (i)&#13;
greater efficiency and equity in the delivery of infrastructure services, (ii) enhancement&#13;
of decentralization of development planning, operation and maintenance responsibilities&#13;
of the RDCs, and (iii) empowerment of local communities by reinforcing the "bottom-&#13;
up" element of the district planning process. The impact of improved economic and social&#13;
infrastructure would be both to raise the quality of rural life and improve linkages/reduce&#13;
costs with local and provincial markets. Since the majority of Zimbabwe's poor (88&#13;
percent) live in rural areas, most of the benefits are expected to accrue to the poorer&#13;
sections of society.&#13;
3.62  The small and dispersed nature of most of the possible sub-projects under this&#13;
component coupled with the uncertainty regarding the exact composition of the capital&#13;
investments make it impossible to quantify its expected rates of return using traditional&#13;
cost-benefit calculations. In its stead, the benefits attributable to the typical sub-projects&#13;
are qualitatively described. Typical sub-projects that are the top priorities of many RDCs&#13;
include roads, water supply, education, and health and these are described below.&#13;
Roads&#13;
3.63  The benefits from rehabilitation of rural roads will result from vehicle operating&#13;
cost savings from reduced road roughness, benefits from savings in road maintenance&#13;
costs, savings in accident costs, and benefits in terms of avoided higher costs of later&#13;
reconstruction. Benefits will also be realized from time saving both of passengers and&#13;
vehicle operators. In addition, improved/new roads will result in increased access of&#13;
agricultural freight to markets, thereby potentially increasing farmers' incomes. There&#13;
will be considerable variation between different RDC road investments due to factors&#13;
such as terrain, level of economic activity, and population served.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
Water Supply&#13;
3.64  The main direct benefits of providing rural water sources that are closer, more&#13;
reliable and more plentiful are savings in time and effort collecting water (especially for&#13;
women), a healthier, more productive rural population due to increase in quantity and&#13;
quality of water, improved health knowledge, better hygiene practices, and potential long-&#13;
term medical cost savings through reduction in water-borne diseases. The availability of&#13;
water could also lead to healthier livestock which are a critical socio-economic and&#13;
cultural element of rural communities. For example, livestock census statistics in Gokwe&#13;
district show that the Bungwa borehole funded under the PDSP has improved the general&#13;
health of the local livestock, increasing the calving rate and increasing the potential off-&#13;
take rate.&#13;
Education&#13;
3.65 The returns to investment in education generate various benefits. "In-school"&#13;
benefits include gains in the efficiency of the education system, per se. Out-of-school"&#13;
benefits include improvement of the income-earning skills of the students and benefits&#13;
that accrue to society at large beyond the project beneficiaries. A recent study7&#13;
has shown that returns to primary and secondary education in Zimbabwe are among the&#13;
highest in the region.&#13;
Health Clinics&#13;
3.66  Most indicators show that health outcomes in Zimbabwe are worse in rural than in&#13;
urban areas. The under-5 mortality rate in 1994 was 80 in rural areas compared to 63 for&#13;
urban areas.8 The most direct benefit of a health clinic in a community served by an RDC&#13;
is the time-savings in the distance traveled (in some cases over 100 kms) by local&#13;
residents to seek health care. Other potential benefits from such projects include: positive&#13;
effects of reduced morbidity and mortality on productivity (fewer days lost from illness&#13;
or disability, fewer worker days lost through premature death, less family time lost);&#13;
consumption benefits (increased output of unmarketed household goods such as wood&#13;
gathering, kitchen gardening etc., increased leisure, higher quality of life, reduced&#13;
suffering to individual and other family members); greater efficiency of the school&#13;
system, i.e., more efficient learning through saving of resources and higher future&#13;
productivity due to better physical and mental development; and reduced household&#13;
expenditures on medical care and supplementary food.&#13;

Cost Recovery and Sustainability&#13;
3.67 To ensure the sustainability of the RDC investments, the RDCs will be required to&#13;
demonstrate how the operation and maintenance costs associated with a sub-project will&#13;
be met. A sub-project like a school or health facility which requires GoZ financial and/or&#13;
manpower support in order to operate will only be eligible for funding if it has the&#13;
support of the relevant Ministry. Similarly, a project which will be operated and/or&#13;
maintained by the RDC itself will only be eligible if the RDC can demonstrate how it will&#13;
obtain the funds required to meet the recurrent funds thereof. Projects will also have to be&#13;
properly appraised to ensure that the option chosen is the least-cost option, and that it is&#13;
viable and justifiable. The Operational Manual requires that at least 10 percent of the&#13;
grant be used to fund projects initiated and implemented entirely or largely by local&#13;
community groups or organizations which will foster a greater sense of ownership among&#13;
the project beneficiaries, thus contributing to the sub-project's sustainability. As required&#13;
by the RDC Act, the district plan from which the sub-projects are derived are based on&#13;
ward-level plans which in turn are based on some form of village-level plans. This is to&#13;
ensure local-level participation in their preparation, a requirement that in conjunction&#13;
with the community-initiated projects discussed earlier will enhance the project's overall&#13;
sustainability.&#13;
3.68  Finally, benefits associated with the institutional development and human&#13;
resources development components include: (i) Providing a framework for improved&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness in planning, financial management, transport management,&#13;
service provision, administration, co-ordination and teamwork; (ii) Increased local&#13;
revenue generation in terms of efficiency of collection from existing sources and the&#13;
development of new potential sources along with improving the fiscal and administrative&#13;
skills of the RDCs; (iii) Strengthening the local government sector as an instrument for&#13;
local decision making and influence of community residents; and (iv) Improved quantity,&#13;
quality and cost-effectiveness of services which should result in better living standards in&#13;
the communities served by the RDCs, and improved use of resources.&#13;
K. Environmental Analysis&#13;
3.69  The project is classified as environmental category B. The project focuses on&#13;
process, and the environmental analysis also needs to be process-oriented. Thus,&#13;
environmental analysis under the project will screen for possible environmental impacts,&#13;
and the capacity for this should be strengthened at the RDC and provincial levels. Annex&#13;
3 presents details of the environmental analysis, and these will be incorporated in the&#13;
Project Operational Manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
L. Poverty and Social Impacts&#13;
3.70  In Zimbabwe, poverty is more prevalent in the rural areas (31 percent) than in&#13;
urban areas (10 percent), and the overwhelming majority of Zimbabwe's poor (88&#13;
percent) live in rural areas. Communal farming areas house 77 percent of Zimbabwe's&#13;
poor and 82 percent of the very poor (CSO, 19929 and World Bank, 199510). Economic&#13;
benefits derived from improvements in quality, quantity, and cost-effectiveness of&#13;
services (e.g., improved transport and access to markets, improved health, and access to&#13;
water and sanitation) to the rural population will thus accrue more to the poorer groups&#13;
than to the better-off. To the extent that the project contributes positively to stronger&#13;
rural development, the employment impact will also be positive.&#13;
3.71   Rural women in Zimbabwe are known to spend significant time fetching water,&#13;
some spending hours each day at the height of the dry season. If, as the initial beneficiary&#13;
surveys suggest, water and sanitation investments are a top priority for the grants and&#13;
loans provided under the RDC Pilot Project, the project should have a particularly&#13;
salutary impact on women's welfare.&#13;
3.72  The project will contribute significantly to GoZ's efforts to reduce rural poverty&#13;
by enhancing the provision of basic services. It is also expected to increase the&#13;
responsiveness of local authorities to the needs of the community and to encourage&#13;
greater community participation in the VIDCOs, WADCOs, and the District planning&#13;
process. The project will aim to create a greater sense of ownership on the part of local&#13;
communities for the projects that the RDC undertakes, thereby enhancing the cost-&#13;
effectiveness and sustainability of service provision. The project will enhance&#13;
accountability and transparency in the RDCs, enabling local communities to be better&#13;
informed on key issues affecting their welfare, and promoting good governance.&#13;
M. Risks and Safeguards&#13;
3.73  It should be recognized that this project presents significant risks. Political&#13;
commitment to decentralization and strengthening local self-government appears to be&#13;
strong now, but this may wane over time as political interests that stand to lose from&#13;
effective decentralization may delay or derail the decentralization process. Both the&#13;
Government and the World Bank will enter uncharted waters under this project, through&#13;
increasing rural local government responsibilities and accountabilities. The main&#13;
safeguard for this risk is the project's design as a pilot, with limited duration and credit&#13;
exposure. It is hoped that through the RDC Pilot Project the Bank may support significant&#13;
success stories, enhanced capacity in rural areas and legitimate constituencies for change&#13;
from a "top-down" control environment to one of local empowerment and accountability.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
3.74  For a given investment in a particular RDC, the risks are relatively high that&#13;
resources will not be managed optimally, particularly in the early years. In fact, these&#13;
risks are inherent to the "learning by doing" process of the RDCCBP, and they should be&#13;
mitigated by the Provincial Development Committee approval and monitoring process in&#13;
general, and the presence of Provincial Support Teams in particular. Risks also should be&#13;
mitigated over time (assuming that political commitment to decentralization policy is&#13;
sustained) as lessons are learned and incorporated in the investment planning,&#13;
implementation, operation and maintenance process.&#13;
3.75  From the perspective of Zimbabwe's longer-term development, however, the&#13;
potential risks of this credit operation are commensurate with the potential development&#13;
benefits. The RDCCBP seeks to strengthen over time the quality and coverage of rural&#13;
infrastructure and services throughout the country. Mistakes will inevitably be made by&#13;
RDCs, but the program's design, incorporating lessons learned from the successful Pilot&#13;
District Support Project funded by ODA during 1989-95, seeks to incorporate mistakes as&#13;
lessons learned so that capacity is developed and that these mistakes are not repeated.&#13;
IV. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
4.01  During negotiations, the following assurances were obtained.&#13;
a) Timely and appropriate financing for the RDC Capital Development Component will&#13;
be provided by the Governments of Sweden and the Netherlands (para. 3.20).&#13;
b) Proceeds of the credit used to finance District Development Loans will be onlent to&#13;
eligible RDCs under the same terms and conditions prevailing for development loans&#13;
under the Public Sector Investment Program (para. 3.31).&#13;
c) The Capacity Building Unit of the MLGRUD and the Provincial Support Teams in&#13;
each participating Province will be adequately staffed and supported for&#13;
implementation of project objectives (paras. 3.36, 3.37).&#13;
d) The project will be carried out in accordance with the Project Operational Manual,&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, and it will not be amended without the Bank's prior consent&#13;
(para. 3.42).&#13;
e) The Government will open and maintain, in US dollars, a Special Account (para.&#13;
3.51).&#13;
f) Procurement will be carried out in accordance with Bank guidelines (paras. 3.55 and&#13;
3.56).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
g) The Special Account and all Project Accounts will be audited according to procedures&#13;
and with auditors acceptable to the Bank (para. 3.59).&#13;
h) A midterm review will be held not later than October 31, 1998 (para. 3.60).&#13;
4.02 The following would be a Condition of Effectiveness.&#13;
a) The Project Operational Manual and the Project Implementation Manual would be&#13;
mandated by the MLGRUD and agreed with the Bank (para. 3.42).&#13;
b) DDG Participation Agreements between the MLGRUD and at least ten RDCs should&#13;
be duly executed (para 3.47).&#13;
Recommendation&#13;
4.04  With the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project would be suitable&#13;
for an Interim Fund Development Credit of US$ 12.25 million equivalent under standard&#13;
IDA terms and conditions.&#13;

Annex 3&#13;
Environmental Analysis&#13;
1.    Background. The Government of Zimbabwe (GoZ) has long supported the&#13;
concept of sustainable development. The 1987 National Conservation Strategy (NCS)&#13;
identified a number of serious environmental issues facing the country and various&#13;
actions that were needed to address the problems. In 1992, the Canadian government&#13;
established the 5-year $15 million Zimbabwe Natural Resources Management&#13;
Programme (ZNRMP) to assist the GoZ in building capacity within the Ministry of&#13;
Environment and Tourism (MET) to implement its NCS through a National&#13;
Environmental Action Plan (NEAP). The four main components of the ZNRMP in the&#13;
MET include training; analysis and databases; environmental assessment; policy,&#13;
planning and legislation.&#13;
2.    Policy, Legal, and Institutional Framework. Prior to 1994, most of the&#13;
Environmental Assessments (EAs) were conducted as a requirement of international&#13;
donor agencies and multinational corporations. Following an official directive from the&#13;
Cabinet to develop the necessary legislation and policy to implement effective&#13;
management of natural resources in the country, the MET promulgated an Environmental&#13;
Impact Assessment (EIA) Policy in 1994.1 Currently, there are 21 pieces of conflicting&#13;
and overlapping statutes directly or indirectly related to environmental management&#13;
administered by at least 8 different Ministries. Some sector-based statutes, including the&#13;
Natural Resources Act, the Mines and Minerals Act, and the Forestry Act, require EIA&#13;
and stipulate measures for enhancing environmental conservation and preventing&#13;
degradation. It is generally accepted that the environmental function of the MET has to be&#13;
harmonized with the functions of other sectoral Ministries and governmental agencies,&#13;
while ensuring that the MET is the umbrella Ministry responsible for overall formulation,&#13;
implementation, and enforcement of environmental legislation. The MET has also&#13;
recently completed a thorough analysis of environment-related legislation in the country,&#13;
including a review of the major institutional issues surrounding the development of new&#13;
legislation. A comprehensive Environmental Management Act is currently being drafted&#13;
rationalizing the existing pieces of environmental legislation, and which would make EA&#13;
mandatory. It is unclear whether the 1994 EIA policy would be incorporated into a&#13;
separate law or would be part of the proposed Environmental Management Act. What is&#13;
indubitable is that the Rural District Council (RDC) Pilot will be implemented in an&#13;
institutional and legislative context for environmental management that is undergoing&#13;
significant and positive reform.&#13;
At present, this policy does not enjoy statutory status.&#13;

3.    Environmental Effects of Sub-Projects. The types of sub-projects that are likely&#13;
to be funded include minor works in water supply and sanitation, roads, clinics, schools,&#13;
and other community facilities. A substantial proportion of investments is expected to be&#13;
for rehabilitation. The net environmental impacts therefore probably will be either&#13;
neutral, as in the case of conscientiously designed new roads, or positive, as in the case of&#13;
provision of water supply and sanitation facilities. Additional positive environmental&#13;
impacts may arise from the construction of community facilities which provide green&#13;
spaces or public meeting areas with water and sanitation facilities. No resettlement is&#13;
envisaged, and the project has been classified as Category B.&#13;
4.    In the light of the above, this analysis is therefore confined to: (i) flagging&#13;
potential adverse impacts ; (ii) presenting a simple questionnaire checklist that could be&#13;
used by the RDCs to evaluate the environmental impact of proposed projects; and (iii)&#13;
ensuring that the appraisal and monitoring of the RDC sub-projects are designed in such a&#13;
way to ensure that each sub-project is properly assessed and monitored for potential&#13;
environmental effects and dealt with on a case-specific basis. The generic impacts of the&#13;
typical sub-projects identified by the RDCs as their top priorities are highlighted under&#13;
each sub-sector as follows:&#13;
5.    Rural roads. As the road works envisaged under this project would consist mainly&#13;
of the upgrading and rehabilitation of existing secondary and feeder roads, no significant&#13;
negative environmental impacts are anticipated. On the other hand, road rehabilitation&#13;
can provide positive environmental impacts by encouraging traffic to remain on&#13;
established roads, rather than using undeveloped alternative routes, rebuilding shoulders&#13;
to increase safety, and repairing or modifying road alignment to improve drainage and&#13;
run-off. The following points may need particular consideration, though:&#13;
(i) Erosion and slope stability. Local erosion problems can be exacerbated and&#13;
slope stability disturbed by road rehabilitation if not carried out properly. These can be&#13;
the result of deficient drainage, modification of water flows, or through excavation for&#13;
gravel and borrow materials. In most instances, potential problems can be avoided or&#13;
mitigated through appropriate design or by taking measures such as backfilling or&#13;
vegetative measures.&#13;
(ii) Impact on the local vegetation/deforestation. Minor excavations/clearings&#13;
may result in the clearance of vegetation increasing deforestation rates. In these cases, the&#13;
problems can be mitigated through appropriate design and minimizing vegetative&#13;
clearance.&#13;
(iii) Cultural issues. The expansion of an existing road may endanger religious,&#13;
spiritual, or archaeological sites. These problems can be avoided by consulting traditional&#13;
leaders and avoiding sub-projects on such environmentally sensitive sites.&#13;
6.    Water Supplv and Sanitation. In general, water supply and sanitation projects&#13;
could be expected to yield positive environmental outcomes for the communities&#13;
57&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 3 of 9&#13;
concerned through safer water, and improved hygiene practices. Issues that deserve&#13;
consideration include:&#13;
(i) Health Hazards. Inadequate protection of the well or borehole surroundings&#13;
could result in possible contamination of the water source. The risk of such&#13;
contamination can be offset by proper design and construction of appropriate protective&#13;
measures for the water source, and training of community members in appropriate&#13;
maintenance practices. Provision of latrines could contaminate shallow groundwater&#13;
resources which could be mitigated through relocating latrines or identification of&#13;
alternative drinking water sources. Aggravation of sanitation problems from unsafe&#13;
disposal of sludge can be mitigated by ensuring properly functioning arrangements for&#13;
disposal of wastes in controlled sites.&#13;
(ii) Use of water points for watering/grazing livestock. There is a possibility of&#13;
overgrazing/watering of livestock leading to degradation of soil and vegetation around&#13;
the water source. This can be avoided by providing alternate sources for watering&#13;
livestock, and alternative pasture areas.&#13;
7.    Social Infrastructure Proiects. The environmental impact of these sub-projects is&#13;
expected to be minimal. A potential area of concern would be to ensure the safe disposal&#13;
of hazardous materials from the health centers. This can be achieved by installing&#13;
incinerators or finding a safe solution (construction of protected disposal pits, for&#13;
instance) to the disposal of wastes. Another potential area of concern could be the&#13;
aggravation of scarcity of local wood resources through use of timber for construction&#13;
and other purposes for school and health facilities. This could be mitigated through the&#13;
use of alternative construction materials to wood. Afforestation measures could also be&#13;
instituted.&#13;
8.    Screening and Appraisal. The process by which sub-projects are screened,&#13;
appraised and approved, will be designed in such a way that negative environmental&#13;
impacts (if any) will be identified at an early stage and adequate mitigating measures&#13;
incorporated into the sub-project design through a consultative process. The Operational&#13;
Manual will require that the RDCs use a simple questionnaire checklist for identifying&#13;
and evaluating the environmental impact of development activities under their&#13;
jurisdiction, and wherever appropriate to determine mitigation measures that will&#13;
minimize adverse impacts. The questionnaire checklist is presented in Table 1 and will&#13;
be discussed and finalized with the Ministry of Local Government, Rural and Urban&#13;
Development (MLGRUD) during appraisal. The checklist will be incorporated in the&#13;
2   This checklist may draw on, inter alia: (i) The Environmental Impact Assessment Policy, Ministry of&#13;
Environment and Tourism, Government of Zimbabwe and (ii) the proceedings of a workshop under&#13;
the auspices of the ARDC which was attended by 19 RDCs compiled in Pilot Study of the&#13;
Environmental Impact Assessment of Proiects Within Rural District Councils (ARDC-FES, March&#13;
1996).&#13;
58&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 4 of 9&#13;
Operational Manual. The RDC Project Officers with the assistance of the Provincial&#13;
Support Teams (PSTs) will be primarily responsible for using the checklist in the&#13;
screening process. Each sub-project would then be classified according to its&#13;
environmental impact (e.g., category A - negative impact; category B - negative but able&#13;
to be mitigated; category C - environmentally benign; category D - environmentally&#13;
positive) together with a brief summary description of the issues of concern and&#13;
mitigating measures proposed. Sub-project proposals that do not include this summary&#13;
description will not be eligible for funding as specified in the Operational Manual.&#13;
9.    Given the nature of the typical sub-projects, it is anticipated that most potential&#13;
problems can be resolved through dialogue and negotiation with the communities,&#13;
technical advice, and by incorporating special features into the design of specific sub-&#13;
projects. If necessary, the PSTs will assist the RDC Project Officers in identifying&#13;
relevant environmental issues and to undertake the necessary technical activities&#13;
necessary to deal with the issues identified in the questionnaire checklist. The appraisal of&#13;
the RDC sub-project proposals at the provincial level will be carried out by a task force&#13;
appointed by the Provincial District Committee (PDC) that includes the Provincial&#13;
Planning Officer and a provincial representative of the National Economic Planning&#13;
Commission (NEPC) who will ensure that the project proposals meet the environmental&#13;
appraisal criteria specified in the Operational Manual. The task force will critically&#13;
review the RDC proposals to ensure that they comply with the environmental appraisal&#13;
criteria set out in the Operational Manual and suggest additional appraisal data, if&#13;
necessary. In addition, the PDC will ensure that reliable means exist for adequate&#13;
planning and implementation of impact management measures, and can and will be&#13;
carried out. Sub-projects with complex environmental impacts (if any) that the RDC or&#13;
the PST is not knowledgeable about with respect to their magnitude, severity, and&#13;
management will be flagged to the PDC. In such exceptional cases, the guidance of the&#13;
provincial representative of the MET will be sought to undertake an EIA in accordance&#13;
with the 1994 EIA Policy. However, it is highly unlikely that this will be required.&#13;
10.   Institutional Capacity and Training. The local capacity to adequately screen,&#13;
oversee the design of sub-projects, and monitor their implementation in accordance with&#13;
environmental criteria is reasonably satisfactory. Of the 57 RDCs, Project Officers from&#13;
19 RDCs have undergone training in diagnostic techniques for conducting EIA in a recent&#13;
workshop organized by the Association of Rural District Councils (ARDC). In addition,&#13;
Project Officers from 20 RDCs associated with CAMPFIRE participated in an EIA&#13;
Training Course organized by USAID. In addition, over the last three years, the ZNRMP&#13;
has trained several hundred natural resource managers in government agencies and&#13;
departments (including local government officials) in project appraisal and environmental&#13;
assessment techniques. The proposed checklist itself is derived from the proceedings of&#13;
the ARDC workshop mentioned earlier and, hence, will not be perceived as an external&#13;
imposition. ARDC has proposed carrying out two more similar workshops to provide&#13;
EIA training to the Project Officers of the RDCs that have previously not been exposed to&#13;
such training. This will be confirmed during appraisal.&#13;

11.   Monitoring and Evaluation. A monitoring system will be established to ensure&#13;
that environmental concerns are appropriately incorporated into the sub-projects. During&#13;
the initial stages of sub-project appraisal and design, there would need to be a strong&#13;
reliance on the RDC Project Officers to identify relevant environmental issues and&#13;
monitor that those responsible for designing and implementing the different sub-projects&#13;
undertake the necessary mitigating measures or other technical activities to deal with the&#13;
issues identified. Mitigation of physical and social impacts (if any) will be achieved&#13;
through a consultative process with the concerned communities. Baseline and impact&#13;
assessment surveys that are part of the project's MIS and evaluation systems will include&#13;
environmental indicators that will provide useful feedback on whether the appraisal&#13;
process is indeed resulting in environmentally sound projects on the ground. In addition,&#13;
the overall compliance with the environmental appraisal procedures will be assessed&#13;
during the Project's operational audit for GoZ FYs 1997/98 and 1998/99.&#13;

thereby increasing deforestation rates?                                                         materials should be mandated or put up woodlots.&#13;
14. Will the project increase the accessibility of woodlands to illegal                         Cutting of trees for wood vending should be strictly&#13;
wood vendors?                                                                                   controlled.&#13;
15. Is there a possibility that the project may increase the incidences                         Sensitize all those connected with the project about&#13;
of veld fires?                                                                                  the dangers of veld fires. If necessary, put up road&#13;
signs to warn road users about problems of veld fires.&#13;
E. Wildlife&#13;

control such activities.&#13;
19. Is there a possibility that excavations will be a danger to wildlife?                       Excavations should be backfilled or fenced off if&#13;
they cause such a danger.&#13;
F. Population and Settlement Patterns&#13;
20. Is there a possibility of an influx of foreign workers that may result                       Local communities should be given priority when&#13;
in pressure over local resources such as water?                                                 recruiting workers.&#13;
21. Will the project cause the relocation of some households?                                    This should be avoided/minimized during project&#13;
siting. If unavoidable, the affected households&#13;
should be adequately compensated and provided&#13;
with an equivalent area to settle.&#13;
22. Is the project likely to cause the development of unplanned settlements?                     Unplanned settlements should be prohibited.&#13;

1. Transport and Communication&#13;
30. Will the project lead to the damage of existing roads?                                       If the impact is temporary, the damages should be&#13;
repaired. If not, the road should be upgraded.&#13;
31. Is the project likely to cause traffic congestion?                                          If the impact is temporary, put up road signs&#13;
warning road users. If not, improve existing roads.&#13;

SECTOR POLICY LETTER: NIINISTRY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT RURAL. AND&#13;
URBAN DEVELOPMENT: ZIMBABWE&#13;
A)   Backeround:&#13;
The philosophy of the Ministry of Local Government Rural and Urban&#13;
Development in its support for decentralization is to promote sound local&#13;
govemance in order to achieve sustainable social and economic development&#13;
at local level as well as to to enhance capacities of local governments where&#13;
the required capacities are inadequate. The Ministry of Local Govemrnment&#13;
Rural and Urban Development's thrust is therefore centred on attempts to&#13;
create appropriate and supportive institutional environment within which&#13;
local government can effectively function. Implied in this philosophy is the&#13;
view that local authorities are established to responsibly plan, implement and&#13;
sustain capital investments in infrastructure and services for the benefit of&#13;
inhabitants of their areas in a transparent and accountable manner. The&#13;
cornerstone of this policy is promotion of a system of local government&#13;
based, on democracy decentralised authorities and people participating in all&#13;
governance processes in their areas. With respect to Rural District Councils&#13;
the Ministry /Government realised, after amalgamation of Rural and District&#13;
Councils that they had very inadequate capacities to undertake functions&#13;
assigned to them in terms of the Act that established them. The governnent&#13;
of Zimbabwe therefore decided to enhance the capacities of these local&#13;
authorities through the design and implementation of Rural District Councils&#13;
Capacity Building Programme over a period of five years. Ivaddition the&#13;
Ministry of Local Government Rural, and Urban Development was aware&#13;
that there were broad policy issues that needed to be addressed if a suitable&#13;
environment for effective local authority service provision is to be created for&#13;
both Rural District Councils and Urban Councils.&#13;
The main issues are the following:&#13;
72&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 2 of 23&#13;
the division of functions between central government and local&#13;
authorities.&#13;
the mechanism  for coordination  of the overall process of&#13;
decentralisation.&#13;
the need to review central government finance and management&#13;
systems so as to bring the planning and budgeting system in line with&#13;
a more decentralised system of local govemance and&#13;
the need for progress in improving local government finance involving&#13;
increased revenue raising and revenue sharing and proper management&#13;
of the same.&#13;
Hence the Ministry of Local Government Rural, and Urban&#13;
Development is proceeding on a two pronged approach, which are&#13;
Capacity Building for Rural District Councils and resolution of broad&#13;
policy issues above.&#13;
B.   Decentralization Policy Framework:&#13;
The Minister of Local Government Rural, and Urban Development after&#13;
Cabinet approval in July 1996 announced to the Press and Public the major&#13;
development that had taken place in the implementation of the government's&#13;
decentralisation policy which is sumrnarised hereunder to illustrate the&#13;
Ministry of Local Government Rural, and Urban Development's sector policy&#13;
on decentralisation.&#13;
The promulgation of the Rural District Councils Act in 1988 and its&#13;
implementation in 1994 marked a policy landmark in the administration and&#13;
development of our rural areas. This Act transferred a wide range of powers,&#13;
authorities, roles and functions from central government to rural district&#13;
councils. The same powers authorities and functions had alreadv been&#13;
transferred to and implemented in Urban Councils since independence in&#13;
1980.&#13;
In the circumstances, however, much work remains to be done to transform&#13;
the policy and law into an action programme for Rural District councils .&#13;
Central government will work out appropriate operational policies and&#13;
procedures to facilitate a smooth transfer of a wide range of powers.&#13;
authorities, roles and functions which the Act had made possible during the&#13;
lifetime of the Rural District Council Capacity Building Programnmne. The&#13;
73&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 3 of 23&#13;
Ministry's experience has also shown the need and importance of reaffTirming&#13;
central government's conmmitment to its policy of decentralisation and the&#13;
development of a common appreciation among senior government officials&#13;
of what decentralisation in the Zimbabwean context means. This common&#13;
appreciation will facilitate the rate at which decentralisation will be&#13;
implemented.&#13;
The government has now mapped a comnrmon approach, comnmon focus and&#13;
emphasis, and common procedures and principles on its support to the&#13;
decentralisation programrnme. Outlined hereunder are the procedures and the&#13;
general principles on decentralisation agreed upon by government:&#13;
1 .   That decentralisation is necessary and desirable based on the clear&#13;
undertaking that it promotes and strengthens democracy and civic&#13;
responsibility as citizens participate in their governance and&#13;
development. It also helps in minirnising bureaucracy by reducing&#13;
levels of decision making and thereby achieving greater efficiency of&#13;
operations. However, it will not be taken as a strategy for dumping&#13;
problems of sector ministries to the local councils.&#13;
2.   That decentralisation be defined and understood to mean the legislated&#13;
transfer of functions and authority from central government to local&#13;
authorities on a permanent basis. Once provided for in law, such&#13;
transfer of powers and functions can be reversed only on the basis of&#13;
an amendment to the appropriate law.&#13;
3.   That there is need for all Ministries to use the same local institutions&#13;
for the implementation and management of decentralised functions&#13;
and not to create parallel or separate institutions. Where parallel&#13;
institutions exist, these should be harrnonised.&#13;
4.   That decentralisation is a process and not an event, as such, it should&#13;
be implemented cautiously and progressively, having regard to the&#13;
human, financial and material capacities of the local authorities to&#13;
whom the transfers would be made.&#13;
5.   That in respect of those activities and projects to be undertaken by&#13;
local authorities, sector ministries retain the power and authoritv to set&#13;
standards, monitor performance and consistency to ensure compliance.&#13;
This means that local authorities will, in executing their legal powvers&#13;
and responsibilities, be required to comply with the requirements of&#13;
74&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 4 of 23&#13;
national policies, laws and regulations.&#13;
6.   That an  inter-ministerial committee of Ministers to manage&#13;
decentralisation and capacity building be established. In this regard,&#13;
the existing inter-ministerial Capacity Building Coordinating&#13;
Committee will report to a Working Party of Heads of Ministries, who&#13;
in turn will report to Ministers on policy issues.&#13;
7.   That central governnent, in implementing decentralisation, shall&#13;
strengthen human and financial resource capacities of local authorities&#13;
so as to make them effective institutions in the provision of the social&#13;
and infrastructural services needed for sustainable local development.&#13;
8.   That central governrment will continue to be responsible for the&#13;
provision of trunk services which impact upon more than one local&#13;
authority area or are of a national character. This refers to all social,&#13;
infrastructural and economic projects that impact upon more than one&#13;
local authority and call for more resources than can be mobilised by&#13;
one local autfiority. For this purpose, line Ministries concerned will&#13;
provide guidelines on which projects are to be undertaken by local&#13;
authorities having regard to the social and economic impact of&#13;
projects, the capital outlay required and the level of professional and&#13;
technical expertise needed to execute the projects.&#13;
9.   That the transfer of powers and functions by line ministries to rural&#13;
district councils be done by the line ministry concerned and that the&#13;
Ministry of Local Government Rural, and Urban Development will&#13;
co-ordinate and facilitate this effort. The initial areas agreed for&#13;
decentralisation to local authorities by sector ministries are detailed in&#13;
Annexure I.&#13;
10.  That all grant moneys for recurrent and capital expenditure sourced by&#13;
line ministries and are earmarked for local authorities be disbursed to&#13;
the local authorities soon after the promulgation of the Appropriation&#13;
Act. Such grants will not pass through the Ministry of Local&#13;
Government Rural, and Urban Development.&#13;
11.  That all government loans to all local authorities should be channelled&#13;
through the Ministry of Local Government Rural, and Urban&#13;
Development except for those loans from the National Housing Fund&#13;
administered by the Ministry of Public Construction and National&#13;
Housing which will be disbursed direct to the councils by that&#13;
ministry. The Ministry of Public Construction and National Housing&#13;
75&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 5 of 23&#13;
will disburse the loans onlv after the local authority concerned has&#13;
been granted borrowing powers by the Ministry of Local Government&#13;
Rural, and Urban Development.&#13;
I2.  That in Zirnbabwe there be only two levels which collect taxes, levies,&#13;
and other user charges namely central government and local&#13;
authorities. Thus both rural district councils and urban councils&#13;
should collect such taxes, levies, fees and user charges for those&#13;
services they should provide in terms of any appropriate law, or&#13;
regulation.&#13;
13. That the Public Service Commission will manage the transfer of&#13;
personnel from central government to rural district councils where this&#13;
happens as part of decentralisation.&#13;
ACTION PLAN&#13;
C.   Capacitv Building:&#13;
The NfLGRUD recognises that the building of capacity in both rural and&#13;
urban local authorities is crucial to the achievement of an effective and&#13;
efficient decentralised system of local governance in Zimbabwe.&#13;
To build capacity in Urban local authorities the Government of Zimbabwe&#13;
has, with the support of the World Bank, been funding the Development&#13;
Component of the Urban II project.&#13;
To strengthen the capacity of Rural District Councils the Government has&#13;
embarked upon a major 5 year Capacity Building Programme. This will&#13;
involve three components, the Capital Development Project, the Institutional&#13;
Development Project and the Human Resources Development Project. The&#13;
success of the Programme hinges upon these three projects being&#13;
implemented for the full 5 years simultaneously, and the absence of any one&#13;
will significantly alter the "chemistry" of the programme and jeopardise Is&#13;
outcome.&#13;
76&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 6 of 23&#13;
Both Urban II and the RDCCBP have a common goal insofar as they seek to&#13;
build the capacities of local authorities to responsibly plan, implement and&#13;
sustain capital investments in services and infrastructure. It is, however,&#13;
vitallv important to appreciate that the environments in which the&#13;
programmes are operating are significantly different and that different&#13;
approaches will be required. Urban authorities are relatively well off&#13;
compared to RDCs, have a stronger resources base and contain better&#13;
qualified and experienced staff. Thus the focus of Urban II has been upon&#13;
physical infrastructure. The less experienced and poorly resourced RDCs&#13;
require an approach which enables them to develop basic competencies and&#13;
self confidence, hence the adoption of an approach to implementation based&#13;
upon learning by doing in a supportive environment for a full five years.&#13;
The Government of Zimbabwe proposes to combine the urban and rural&#13;
components of capacity building into a more holistic programme, the Local&#13;
Government Development Project (LGDP). However Government is aware&#13;
of the potential risks involved in combing these two programmes, and that&#13;
it must be done carefully and sensitively. It is absolutely fundamental that&#13;
the weaving together of the Urban and Rural local government projects into&#13;
the LGDP does not compromise the learning-by-doing approach at anv stage&#13;
in the life of the RDCCBP. The importance of this can not be over stated.&#13;
The LGDP is to be operationalised after two years of the RDCCBP. At this&#13;
stage most RDCs will have exposed their weaknesses and be trying to rebuild&#13;
their systems and structures. They will require consistent and coherent&#13;
support at this stage in the learning process and must be confident that the&#13;
resources to facilitate this will be available. In other words it is crucial that&#13;
a commitment to supporting the learning process approach for the full 5&#13;
years is made at the outset of the programme and that RDCs are confident of&#13;
this.&#13;
i.   Capacitv Strengthening for Rural District Councils:&#13;
The current capacity of Rural District Councils to tackle the functions&#13;
which the 1988 Act enables them to undertake is extremely varied&#13;
reflecting the different human, financial and physical resources&#13;
inherited by Rural District Councils from their predecessors. The&#13;
natural resource and economic bases of Rural District Councils are&#13;
also extremely heterogeneous. Therefore the needs and ability to&#13;
meet them also vary significantly. The key weaknesses and gaps&#13;
77&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 7 of 23&#13;
common to most local authorities have been identified as firstly&#13;
human resources and financial resources ( including vehicles and&#13;
equipment). Secondly, there are the organisational characteristics&#13;
involving leadership qualities and organisation's sense of a mission,&#13;
management systems and structures and the degree of discipline,&#13;
openness and accountability within the organisation. To strengthen the&#13;
capacity of Rural District Councils the Government has embarked&#13;
upon a major Capacitv Building Programme. The objective of the&#13;
RDCCBP is to enhance the capacity of RDCs to plan, manage and&#13;
sustain district development, and to enable the provision and&#13;
maintenance of rural service provision on a sustainable basis. The&#13;
GoZ has adopted a "learning by doing" process approach to capacity&#13;
building for the RDCCBP, in which development funds, provided&#13;
through the Capital Development Project, will stimulate a process of&#13;
action as RDCs plan and manage development projects. This, in tum,&#13;
will provide the scope for facilitators - provided under the Institutional&#13;
Development Project - to help RDCs expose and rectify weaknesses&#13;
in overall planning and management systems and structures. The IDP&#13;
will also enable RDCs to learn on-the-job with guidance and support&#13;
from facilitators. Other, more formal training needs will be addressed&#13;
through the Human Resources Development Project. All three of&#13;
these components will be fundamental to the success of learning&#13;
process approach throughout the life of the Programme: if one is not&#13;
in place the success of the overall RDCCBP will be undermined. The&#13;
Ministry of Local Government Rural, and Urban Development will&#13;
also enhance this process by creating an enabling environment for&#13;
councils by addressing broad policy issues over the five years of the&#13;
RDCCBP implementation with the assistance of CBCC which is a part&#13;
of the Institutional Development Project.&#13;
The Ministry of Local Government Rural, and Urban Development is&#13;
also aware that there will be need for extremely close and efficient&#13;
cooperation and coordination between different components of the&#13;
programme through out the lifetime of the programme horizontally at&#13;
national, provincial and district levels respectively and vertically&#13;
between these levels. The Ministry will ensure this close cooperation&#13;
and coordination of the programme through use of the Institutional&#13;
structures which have already been put in place which are:&#13;
Interministerial committee of Ministers, the Working Party of Heads&#13;
of Ministries, the Interrninisterial Capacity Building Coordinating&#13;
Committee, the National Capacity Building Unit, the Provincial&#13;

Councils themselves. The division of responsibilities between the&#13;
CBU and Ministry of Local Government Rural and Urban&#13;
Development in the implementation of CBP are detailed in annexure&#13;
3.&#13;
The NMinistry of Local Government Rural, and Urban Development&#13;
will during the implementation of the programme ensure that:&#13;
a)   all local authorities meet certain basic legal requirements in&#13;
terms of staffing and management systems before they receive&#13;
any funding.&#13;
b)   the funded projects comply with the criteria laid down by the&#13;
Ministry of Local Government Rural, and Urban Development.&#13;
c)   the prescribed procedures and criteria are followed in&#13;
identifying projects for funding under the DDGs or loans by all&#13;
local authorities.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation will be undertaken not only to measure&#13;
achievements relative to specific end targets but as a tool in the&#13;
institutional development process itself, stimulating dialogue and&#13;
learning amongst programme partners, in facilitating redesign weak&#13;
aspects of the programme and ensuring stake holder participation in&#13;
the process.&#13;
Elaborate formal monitoring structure have been developed under the&#13;
institutional development component which is now being&#13;
implemented.  Outlined hereunder are the main documentary&#13;
requirements under the Capital Development Component.&#13;
(a)  All Local Authorities will be required to follow approved accounting&#13;
procedures to ensure that funds are used for the purpose of their&#13;
disbursement and that their accounts are audited annually.&#13;
(b)  Under the RDC CBP all Provincial Administrators will be required to&#13;
keep documentation of funded projects in their province which will be&#13;
used to monitor performance of each local authority and submit half&#13;
yearly and annual reports on all funded projects using the Ministry&#13;
prescribed format, and&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(c)  The national level will keep a comprehensive records on all aspects of&#13;
the funded projects and compile half yearly and annual progress&#13;
reports to be presented to the CBCC and made available to external&#13;
funding agents.&#13;
ii.   Capacitv Strencthenin2 for Urban Councils.&#13;
For Urban Councils the MILGRUD adopted the Staff Appraisal Report (No.&#13;
7619 of 1989) which among other issues identified the need for building,&#13;
developing and strengthening of (1) institutional and (2) technical capacities&#13;
in the institutions involved in the management of urban projects. The&#13;
technical capacity component of the World Bank funded Urban II involved&#13;
" a once off" equipping of the local authorities with vehicles and plant and&#13;
equipment.  The Institutional component funded by NDF has two&#13;
subcomponents which are human resources development and operations&#13;
management in local governments, government departments and the&#13;
Programme Coordination and Monitoring Unit in the Ministry of Local&#13;
Government Rural,'and Urban Development.&#13;
The vehicles and plant and equipment were purchased and delivered to all&#13;
local governments implementing the project. The implementation of the&#13;
operations management include assistance to local governments in areas of&#13;
soft ware, accounting, financial management, operations maintenance etc.&#13;
coordinated by MLGRUD with the assistance of NDF Consultants and&#13;
PCMU.&#13;
Under the Human Resources Development the MLGRUD is implementing&#13;
training under a Comprehensive Training Plan based on SIDA Training&#13;
Needs Assessment Study of 1991, the actual needs and critical areas&#13;
identified in the implementation of the Urban II Project and submissions of&#13;
training needs by individual local authorities. Two of the three phases of&#13;
training are complete while Phase II whose thrust is in service training of&#13;
staff of local authorities is still being implemented.&#13;
D.   Intergovernmental Fiscal relations:&#13;
The overall objective of the RDCCBP and Urban II Project is development&#13;
of capacity for local authorities to responsibly plan, implement and sustain&#13;
capital investments in services and infrastructure. The needs of rural district&#13;
and urban councils are however different, but the overall goal is one:&#13;
autonomy for all local authorities. This goal will be central to the design of&#13;
the LGDP which will be the successor to both the RDC Pilot and the Urban&#13;
80&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 10 of 23&#13;
II Projects.&#13;
The ways in which the RDCCBP/RDC Pilot Project and the Urban [I Project&#13;
efforts will be woven together in the LGDP are problematic. The two types&#13;
of local authorities are at different stages of evolution of local govemance.&#13;
The GOZ with respect to RDCs has decided to allow broad policy issues to&#13;
be developed in a two pronged approach over the five years of the RDCCBP&#13;
implementation and to be decided upon through the CBCC which is part of&#13;
the Institutional Development Component of the programme. In the Urban&#13;
Sector the division of functions between Central Government and Local&#13;
authorities is satisfactorily defined. The main thrust or emphasis will be on&#13;
the reform of the fiscal relationships between central government and&#13;
councils with the overall goal to increase financial resources availability to&#13;
councils.&#13;
One of the often advocated means to increase fmancial resources available&#13;
toocal authorities is revenue sharing between central governnent and local&#13;
authorities. The MLGRUD considers that this concept is a noble one but in&#13;
Zimbabwe the dual nature of the economy evidenced by poor and fairly good&#13;
financial resources bases for RDCs and urban councils respectively makes&#13;
its immediate implementation for capital investments inequitable as the&#13;
central fiscus is already crowded by the need to implement projects of a&#13;
national nature in infrastructure. Urban Local Authorities have a strong&#13;
enough resource base to, under enabling environment, raise enough capital&#13;
including government loans to implement their own projects. The RDCs&#13;
because of the weak resource will need a combination of central government&#13;
grants and loans. The recurrent expenditure grants for specified services&#13;
such as Education and Health provided should continue under the LGDP.&#13;
The MLGRUD will pursue a policy to guarantee these loans and grants by&#13;
making a pre set percentage of the annual national budget through reforrm&#13;
or legislation. There will be a need for a study and consultations on this&#13;
matter.&#13;
To achieve the aforesaid the MLGRUD needs to undertake a number of steps some&#13;
of which are outlined below:-&#13;
(a)  Institution of the DDG instrument to be accomplished through the Pilot&#13;
Project and to be broadened to include recurrent grants to all councils under&#13;
LGDP.&#13;
(b)  Establishment of Council performance monitoring system again to be&#13;
81&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 11 of 23&#13;
established under to Pilot Project and more broadly applied under LGDP.&#13;
(c)   Linking grants to performance once the granting and performance evaluation&#13;
systems are established. This will require detailed analysis of key&#13;
indicators and ways in which will be rewarded and vice versa. This should&#13;
be achieved through the Pilot Project.&#13;
(d)  Achieving equity in granting system to assure that disadvantages councils are&#13;
not penalized for their initial lack of resources and! or capacity while still&#13;
providing incentives to councils which perform well. Derivation of&#13;
performance monitoring systems and equity weighting mechanisms will&#13;
allow design of a fully functioning earmarked block grant system applicable&#13;
to all councils.&#13;
(e)  Installation of the block grant system to govern all central transfers to local&#13;
govenmments achievement of this goal will probably be expected during the&#13;
third year of the LGDP.&#13;
E.   Mobilisation of Private Investment:&#13;
The final step in the creation of local govemment autonomy is the promotion&#13;
of private investment in the provision of local services on a sustainable basis.&#13;
This is a complex and new concept to local govemance in Zimbabwe. There&#13;
is thereforea need for a thorough study and consultations before its&#13;
introduction to both types of local authorities.&#13;

The issues that are of direct and immediate concern to the Ministry of Agriculture in&#13;
regard to the process of decentralization and the Rural District Council Capacity Bilding&#13;
Programme include the following:&#13;
(')    Collection of Dipping levies&#13;
The Departnent of Veteriary Services in preparing the relevant receipt books to&#13;
faclitate colection of dipping levies by district councils in addition to PTC which&#13;
is assisting them at the moment. A handling fee of 10% will be payable to the&#13;
councils.&#13;
(b)    Communa - Area Cattle Sales Trust Fund&#13;
The handling of communal area cattle sales and the Trust Fund for repairs and&#13;
maintenance was temporarily transferred from CSC to ZFU working with a committee involving&#13;
CSC, Vets, Agritex and District Councils.&#13;
This arrangement has not worked well and the Ministry is examining the feasibility&#13;
of transferring this to Rural District Councils.&#13;
Other Areas for Future Consideration&#13;
-     Management of Smallholder Irrigation Schemes and Related Infrastructure.&#13;
-     Marketing of Agricultural Produce.&#13;
-     Input Supply and Distnbution and Construction of Storage Warehouses.&#13;
-     Livestock Communal Grazing Schemes and Feedlots.&#13;
-     Drought Mitigation Activities.&#13;
The above areas can be managed by rural district councils and consultations with relevant&#13;
technical departments should take place thrbugh the worldng party to come up with firm&#13;
proposals.&#13;

Page 16 of 23&#13;
SUMMARY OF AREAS OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT LOCAL GOVERNANCE&#13;
POLICY FRAMEWORK&#13;
Capacity Building Assistance for the Local Government Development Project:&#13;
Experience to date from both the RDCCBP and the Urban II Project has pointed to the need for an&#13;
administratvely and technically strong P.TU to support Program. Ideallv the bilateral donors m.ight offer to&#13;
support capacutv building assistance for local governments above RDC level.&#13;
2.      Legislative Review:&#13;
The MILGRUD will dunng RDC Pilot Project hire the services of local consultants supported by international&#13;
specialists to review all relevant acts to local governments and recommend amendments to provisions of acts&#13;
which are contrary to the Ministry's concept of devolution or decentralisation in order to enshnne&#13;
decentralisaton of authority and resources to local governments. Funds are already available under the IDP&#13;
of the RDCCBP to carrvout a review of Acts relevant to RDCs dunng the RDC the first 2 years of the&#13;
programme period. A broader study encompassing Urban Council legislation will also be required.&#13;
3.      Municipal Classification System Reviews&#13;
The MLGRUD intends to review the present way the Municipal classification system&#13;
works, the authority and responsibilities which are assigned to each level, overview the capacities&#13;
at various levels and make recommendations as to the appropnate changes to be made in the classification&#13;
system. Funds for study are not yet avadable as present bilateral donors support is for RDCCBP.&#13;
Funds wil be solicited during the RDC the first 2 years of the programme. Ideally the study would be carried&#13;
out by a team of both local and intemational specialists.&#13;
4.      Design of the Block Grant System:&#13;
The introduction of the DDG under the RDCCBP although initially intended to be a&#13;
means or fuel for the learning by doing" or process approach adopted by government is a&#13;
type of block grant system which the Ministry has advocated for some time. The MLGRUD&#13;
therefore needs a well designed block grant system proposal as a tool for advocating the&#13;
introduction of the same by M.O.F. to all levels of local governments.&#13;
Tie proposed system would need to take into account central government ear marking&#13;
for specific purposes, the different types of gants assistance which would be most&#13;
relevant to different levels of local governments, the central budgeting and disbursement&#13;
system etc.&#13;
The funds are not yet available for this studyv The funds will be solicited for durng the&#13;
RDC Pilot Project and implemented during the LGDP.&#13;
5.      Central Ministry Establishment Reform:&#13;
Tliere will be need if decentralisation is to succeed to review and reform the&#13;
establishments of central muinstnes mncluding MLGRI ID. In the case of MILGRUD the&#13;
study must involve the review of departments at the national level, and the relevance of the province&#13;
and the district levels. The central ministries to be reviewed mnclude Ministnes of Finance. National&#13;
Economic Planning Commission. Health. Education. Lands and Water Resources Development etc.&#13;
This studv should be sponsored by the Nlinistry of Finance or the President's Office for it to be&#13;
87&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 17 of 23&#13;
accepted by all ministries and implemented. The study must be done during the RDC Pilot and&#13;
implemented during the LGDP. No funds are yet available for this study but it is felt that bilatenl&#13;
donors will be willing to fund it&#13;
6.      Comrnercialising Local Authority Activities&#13;
A study of the potential for commerciaizing urban local authority services has recently been completei A&#13;
second phase of the study would be to extend the investigation to cover all local authorities drswig on&#13;
rgcent lessons learned from the Urban local authorities.&#13;
7.      The role of State Land and Central Rates Fund&#13;
There is need to review the roles of the State Land Office and the Central Rates Fund in  the MLGRUD&#13;
and that of councils with a view to reform the system for the benefit of all local authorities and their&#13;
constituents. The study to review these two institutions and make recommendations is overdue and therefore&#13;
must be carried out as soon as funds are available. The MLGRUD will make formal request to the Bank to&#13;
facilitate the funding of this study as its finding will deftitely enhnce both the capscity and fitnance of local&#13;
governments. The study would comprise two components:&#13;
a)     an inventory of state land in each local government jurisdiction&#13;
b)      recommendations on the priorities and methods by which the land could be turned over to local&#13;
governments to spur productive investments. The study should be canied out by regional or&#13;
international speciaiists with local consultants forming part of the study team.&#13;
8.      Debt and Equity Options in Mobilising Private Investment&#13;
The purpose of the study would be to form the baseline for establishing a municipal finance market(s).&#13;
There are a number of options that could be considered. USAED will be appmoached to consider funding&#13;
the study which will require input from municipal finance specialist with international experience.&#13;
9.      Decentralisation&#13;
The NtLGRUD intends to seek the assistance of a donor to fund an wnmbrella study for management of&#13;
decentraiisation process and the resultant project proposaL The UNDP has expressed intrest to finance both&#13;
aspects of this project Initial discussions between UNDP and the MLGRUD havo already taken placc This&#13;
study should start before the implementation of the RDC Pilot Project and the implementation of the&#13;
resultant reconmmendations during RDC Pilot Project in line with the MLGRTlDs sdopted two pronged&#13;
approach.&#13;

another twelve computers, two heavy duty printers and two lap top computers.&#13;
In addition the Departmeut also needs one heavy duty photocopier and a fax&#13;
machine and one server and eniouglh network equipment to link about twenty&#13;
offices to the network.&#13;
As a starting point it is proposed that training in basic computer appreciation be&#13;
given to twelve people to enable tlietn to use the computers. The other training&#13;
needs of the department will unravel as the programme gains momentum and tramining gaps are&#13;
identified in the learning process.&#13;

The Capacity Building Unit is the npleemeuting arm of the Capacity Building&#13;
Co-ordinating Committee. Its work emauates from the deliberations of its mother&#13;
body the Capacity Building Co-ordiiiatiiig Commnittee. The Unit should therefore&#13;
aim at fulfilling the objectives of the CBCC. In servicing the CBCC well the CBU flourishes.&#13;
The CBU should therefore strive at makinig the CBCC succeed and inversely the&#13;
minstry and Governmeut as a whole. ThLis lhowever cannot be done by taking over the&#13;
role of the ministry or goveniment.&#13;
TIhese broad principles translate themselves into the following roles;&#13;
Assisting the CBCC to build the capacity of Rural District Councils through:&#13;
Collating and preparing infonnationi requiring the consideration of the&#13;
CBCC including recommendatious on policy issues for the programme.&#13;
Making the necessary preparations for CBCC meetings and providing secretariat services.&#13;
Implementing actions arising from decisions of the CBCC.&#13;
Managing and co-ordinatiug the programme components, financially and administratively.&#13;
Organising the estabhshment and induction of the provincial support teams in each province.&#13;
Guiding professionally, the PSTs and providing support as required.&#13;
Establishing and facilitating linkages both between the CBCC and PSTs and between&#13;
the PSTs, TC facilitators and TC team leader, ensuring effective and regular&#13;
communication and experience sharing.&#13;
Monitoring the implementatiou of activities of the capacity building programme.&#13;
(statement of expenditure, project appraisal reports for both disbursement and progress&#13;
reporting purposes).&#13;
Procuring equipment for the programme with the full knowledge of the Planning&#13;
and Budgeting sub-committee of the CBCC.&#13;
Producing regular progress reports on the programme for the CBCC.&#13;
Managing the financing of the CBU, CBCC and the PSTs including the preparation&#13;
of quarteriy accounts and financial reports to Ministry of Finance. Administration&#13;
of the special account with the guidance of the Department.&#13;

Because of that special position thie Ministry of Local Govemment Rural&#13;
and Urban Development (DLAA) on a day to day basis, has a mnnagement&#13;
responsibility to ensure the successful implementation of the Rural District&#13;
Councils Capacity Buildiug Programme.&#13;
The Ministry ensures that the Capacity Building Unit carries out the&#13;
CBCC's resolutions timeously and accordiug to the policies and objectives of&#13;
the Government of Zimbabwe.&#13;
As the professional head of the facilitation team (PSTs/TCO), the CBU is bound to&#13;
identify the need for chauges and otlher related constraints in its operations. These&#13;
are brought to the attentiou of the Miuistry of Local Government Rural and Urban&#13;
Development (DLAA) on a day to day basis before they are formally tabled before&#13;
the CBCC for cousideratiou aud guidance. In like manner the Mbiistry of Local&#13;
Government Rural, and Urbani Developmeut (DLAA) could, in its normal operations&#13;
idenitify urgent business wihichi nieeds to he looked illto. TiWs could be again brought&#13;
to the atteution of the CBIJ by the Ministry before they are formally considered by the CBCC.&#13;

Annex 7&#13;
Proposed Auditing Arrangements&#13;
Backgrsond&#13;
A key principle of the RDCCBP is the promotion of learning by doing among&#13;
participating RDCs. With regard to the capital investment component of the program, it&#13;
will be very important to ensure that adequate monitoring of the RDCs' management of&#13;
DDGs and DDLs is carried out so that any difficulties can be identified, brought to the&#13;
attention of the RDCs and rectified. The bi- and multilateral donors involved in funding&#13;
the capital investment component must also have access to audit reports to support their&#13;
contributions to the program.&#13;
The challenge is to ensure that RDCs are assisted in their learning by doing by adapting&#13;
audit requirements to both meet donor needs and support, rather than impose upon, the&#13;
RDCs in carrying out their duties. Evaluation of the program's performance should, to&#13;
both support capacity building and satisfy donor requirements, address a number of key&#13;
areas including:&#13;
--impact of investments&#13;
--improvement in RDC planning, implementation and maintenance performance&#13;
--financial accountability&#13;
--central disbursement management.&#13;
Following is a suggested approach to gathering necessary data for all of these areas&#13;
without overburdening RDCs or diverting resources from their intended investment&#13;
purposes.&#13;
1. Impact Assessment and Performance Evaluation- plans are already well advanced for a&#13;
UNDP managed impact assessment baseline study. This study, as presently designed,&#13;
will collect a wide variety of data from a sample of 8 RDCs (at least one from each&#13;
province) over a multi-year period. This study will allow assessment of progress&#13;
resulting from, particularly, the institution building component of RDCCBP. Included in&#13;
this assessment will be evaluation of the performance of the selected RDCs in following&#13;
the Operations Manual to plan, implement and subsequently maintain capital investments&#13;
including those funded through the DDGs and DDLs.&#13;
The Bank and bilateral donors financing the capital investment component of RDCCBP&#13;
require evaluations of the performance of all 57 RDCs in managing these investments.&#13;
Rather than commissioning a separate evaluation activity--which would consume&#13;
significant time and resources--it would be more efficient to incorporate this evaluation&#13;
into the UNDP managed baseline study. Since this study will be taking place in all 8&#13;
provinces, the additional workload to evaluate all RDCs with respect to the capital&#13;
96&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
component of the project should not be overwhelming. A draft scope of work for this&#13;
activity is attached, and is proposed for inclusion in the baseline study TOR.&#13;
2. Financial Accountability- existing Government regulations require that all RDCs&#13;
submit independently audited financial statements within nine months of the end of each&#13;
financial year. These regulations are acceptable to the Bank. At present more than 30 of&#13;
the RDCs are in compliance, but about 24 have significant backlogs of unaudited annual&#13;
accounts. It is necessary, therefore, to provide directed assistance to these RDCs to clear&#13;
their books and resume the mandated annual auditing regime.&#13;
Funding for the technical assistance required to achieve this goal could be provided&#13;
through the policy development component of the RDC Pilot project. This component,&#13;
which is administered by MLGRUD through the CBU, could make available funding for&#13;
RDCs to contract certified auditors to clear RDC books. Following this assistance, all&#13;
RDCs would, as a condition of eligibility to receive capital grants and loans, be required&#13;
to conform with established Government auditing requirements from financial year 97/98&#13;
forward. All RDCs would be required to pay for these audits from their own resources,&#13;
and PSTs would monitor to ensure that satisfactory auditing arrangements are in place for&#13;
all RDCs.&#13;
This eligibility requirement should be incorporated in the RDCCBP Operations manual&#13;
with the additional codicil that all RDC annual audited accounts must contain a specific&#13;
assessment of RDC operation of the RDCCBP/Pilot Project capital investment account&#13;
(this would not be an onerous requirement, amounting to little more than a few&#13;
sentences). Since the task of clearing unaudited annual accounts can be fairly&#13;
complicated, it will be necessary to secure specialized assistance to draft a Terms of&#13;
Reference for this critical activity.&#13;
CBU and the Bank will work together to secure this specialized assistance. Assuming&#13;
that each problem RDC would require Z$ 100,000 to clear its books, about US$240,000&#13;
from the Pilot Project policy component would be earmarked for this purpose.&#13;
3. Central Financial Management- the remaining audit requirement would be for&#13;
MLGRUD/CBU central management. A separate contract for this purpose will be&#13;
necessary, and Bank assistance will be available in drafting the TOR.&#13;
In summary, these combined approaches to auditing requirements would appear to satisfy&#13;
both Government and donor requirements. It is very important that the Ministry assign a&#13;
high priority to finalizing these arrangements so that RDCCBP and the Pilot Project can&#13;
commence from a solid footing.&#13;

Attachment to Annex 7&#13;
Draft Scope of Work&#13;
Performance Audits for the RDC Pilot Project&#13;
(Note: if agreed by all parties, the following scope of work would be added to the UNDP&#13;
terms of reference for the RDCCBP baseline Evaluation Project).&#13;
Monitoring Implementation of the DDG Operational Manual&#13;
The DDG Operational Manual sets out very clearly the:&#13;
--criteria for use of DDGs&#13;
--procedures for DDG project identification and applications&#13;
--appraisal at the RDC and Provincial levels&#13;
--disbursement procedures&#13;
--implementation guidelines&#13;
--monitoring and evaluation at RDC, Provincial and National levels.&#13;
The Provincial Development Committees (PDCs) and the Provincial Support Teams&#13;
(PSTs) have primary responsibility for ensuring that the DDG Manual procedures are&#13;
implemented by all RDCs. The PDCs and PSTs are well placed to carry out their&#13;
respective review and facilitating functions. As direct participants, in support of the&#13;
RDCs, in the DDG planning and implementation processes these bodies would benefit&#13;
from periodic, independent assessments of the overall performance of the new system&#13;
embodied in the Operational manual. In addition, independent performance evaluations&#13;
would provide useful information to the CBU as well as bi- and multilateral donors which&#13;
are financing the DDGs.&#13;
The UNDP-managed program impact assessment study is designed to provide detailed&#13;
information for a sample of RDCs in each province of Zimbabwe. The design of this&#13;
study includes assessments after the first 6 and 12 months of RDCCBP operations, and&#13;
annually thereafter for the life of the program. As such, the impact assessment provides a&#13;
very useful vehicle to achieve assessment of the performance of all participating RDCs&#13;
in implementing the provisions of the Operational Manual.&#13;
1. Scope of Work&#13;
This additional task would be carried out within the overall impact assessment activity&#13;
without adding an undue burden to either the assessment team(s) or the participating&#13;
organizations. During each scheduled assessment in all provinces, selected members of&#13;
the assessment team would verify the following information relating to implementation of&#13;
the DDG Operational Manual as follows:&#13;
98&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
a. Review all annual work program (AWP) submissions from councils to RDCs to&#13;
ascertain compliance with the Manual's provisions regarding project&#13;
identification, application and appraisal. In a typical province, this would involve&#13;
review of about 8 submissions requiring no more than several person days of&#13;
effort.&#13;
b. During each scheduled assessment period, the team would interview all (where&#13;
each RDC is readily accessible) or a sample of RDCs in some detail regarding the&#13;
planning processes adopted by those RDCs in framing their DDG proposals for&#13;
the year. These interviews would focus upon the degree to which participation&#13;
from key interest groups was included in the planning process, methods by which&#13;
RDCs prioritized the investments proposed for DDG funding, and provisions&#13;
made (budgetary and otherwise) by RDCs for efficient maintenance and&#13;
utilization of the DDG funded investments. In provinces where interviewing only&#13;
a sample of RDCs is required due to logistical considerations, care would be taken&#13;
to ensure that the remaining RDCs are contacted in the subsequent scheduled&#13;
assessment. Depending upon the province, these interviews might require an&#13;
additional 10 person days per assessment.&#13;
c. Beginning with the assessment scheduled for mid-1998, the scope would&#13;
broaden to include review of RDC compliance with Manual provisions regarding&#13;
procurement and disbursement. This additional sub-task should add no more than&#13;
one person day to the interviewing task discussed in b. above.&#13;
d. The assessment team would also specifically review the community-driven&#13;
projects for which a 10% set aside is included in the DDGs. Of particular&#13;
importance would be review of the project identification process to determine the&#13;
means by which community initiatives are solicited and prioritized by RDCs for&#13;
implementation.&#13;
2. Reporting&#13;
A brief, separate report would be prepared by each provincial assessment team detailing&#13;
findings for the items discussed above. These reports would be submitted to CBU for&#13;
distribution. This report preparation would add approximately 10 person days of effort to&#13;
each scheduled assessment.&#13;
3. Additional Level of Effort&#13;
A rough estimate of the additional level of effort required for this task over the 2 year&#13;
period corresponding to the RDC pilot project would be 140 person days. Assuming&#13;
average fees and expenses of US$200/day, additional budget of US$30,000 may be&#13;
required. This funding may be available from ODA; if not, provision from the RDC Pilot&#13;
Policy Development component can be accommodated.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Rural District
            Council Pilot Capital Development Project is to develop the
            capacity of all Rural District Councils (RDCs) to plan,
            implement, and manage the sustainable delivery of essential
            services. The program consists of the a) institutional and
            b) human resources development components complemented by b)
            the capital development component. The institutional
            development component will support improvements in the
            capacities of the RDCs to plan and sustain priority services
            and facilities as well as financing basic equipment
            acquisition. The human resources component is designed to
            build capacity to provide continuing human resources
            development assistance to the RDCs and to respond to
            specific needs. The capital development component will
            provide RDCs with access to grant funds necessary to a)
            reequip and reinitiate critical services and infrastructure;
            and b) provision and create incentives for improved RDC performance.
