    Between 1996 and 2005, natural catastrophic events had                                  earthquake on households, businesses in the area and on the&#13;

    On August 15, 2007, an earthquake measuring 7.9 on the                                  earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale. This major&#13;
    Richter scale shook the southern part of the central coast of                           earthquake, which impacted the Ica region and provinces&#13;
    Peru, with devastating consequences. Given the magnitude                                south of Lima, disrupted the lives of roughly 431,000&#13;
    of the damage caused, one wonders how much less the cost                                persons, leaving more than 200,000 homeless and killing&#13;

    unpreparedness cost to the sector providing water and sanitation                        on Water and sanitation systems&#13;

    been the gain to society or the reconstruction savings if risk                          economic losses could have been reduced had disaster-&#13;

Direct effects (damages) are those that impacted the                                               gender and the environment) and businesses that operate&#13;

the natural event and right after it happened. Measuring&#13;
the direct effects using the ECLAC methodology entails                                             In order to calculate the cost of not implementing risk&#13;
calculating the cost of restoring water and sewage systems                                         management measures on the urban water and sewage&#13;
to pre-earthquake conditions. In addition, an estimate was                                         systems prior to the earthquake in Ica, Pisco, Chincha and&#13;
done of the cost of the damage under a scenario where the                                          CaÃ±ete, the estimates corresponding to the scenarios where&#13;
systems, in addition to being operational, were properly                                           the systems were maintained (scenario 1) and where systems&#13;
maintained when the natural event occurred. Lastly, the cost                                       were constructed with earthquake-resistant materials&#13;
of the damage was also estimated under a scenario where                                            (scenario 2) were subtracted from the actual costs incurred&#13;
the systems were built with earthquake-resistant materials                                         to restore the systems to pre-earthquake operating levels&#13;
and were properly maintained when the earthquake struck.                                           (baseline scenario) (see Graph 2).&#13;
The latter reflects a scenario where the water and sanitation&#13;
utilities apply preventive risk management measures5.                                              Indirect effects include (i) the loss of revenue by water and&#13;
                                                                                                   sanitation utilities from reduced billing as well as water&#13;
This approach facilitated the determination of the costs                                           losses resulting from the failure to repair direct damages&#13;
incurred by urban water and sanitation utilities in Peru owing to                                  sustained; and (ii) higher operating costs resulting from the&#13;
the absence of disaster risk management practices. In addition,                                    temporary provision of the service during the reconstruction&#13;
an estimate was also done of the impact of the earthquake on                                       period. In order to estimate both, a calculation was made on&#13;
households (household water and drainage service; health;                                          the difference between revenue, water losses, and operating&#13;

                                                                                                   would have resulted, based on historical trends, had the&#13;

            Disaster risk management in water and
            sanitation : economic impact of the 2007 earthquake in the
            water and sanitation sector in four provinces of Peru -
            what did unpreparedness cost the country?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Between 1996 and 2005, natural
            catastrophic events had an estimated cost of US$575.2
            billion world-wide. In particular, it has been observed that
            developing countries are relatively more affected by such
            events, since its gross domestic product (GDP) have showed
            sharper declines than developed countries' ratios. On
            August 15, 2007, an earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter
            scale shook the southern part of the central coast of Peru,
            with devastating consequences. Given the magnitude of the
            damage caused, one wonders how much less the cost of
            rehabilitating water and sanitation systems might have been
            if public investment projects and management of urban
            utilities (companies in charge of the water and sanitation
            provision), had incorporated disaster risk reduction
            measures. For this reason, and because this is a key public
            sector service for the wellbeing of population, the World
            Bank's water and sanitation program commissioned Apoyo
            Consultoria S.A.C. to conduct a research on the water and
            sanitation sector in order to attend the following inquiry:
            how much unpreparedness cost to the sector providing water
            and sanitation services? In other words, in economic terms,
            what will have been the gain to society or the
            reconstruction savings if risk prevention measures had been
            included in the management of services in the sector
            proposed for the analysis?
