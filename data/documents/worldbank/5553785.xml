Sanitation and Hygiene in Kenya:&#13;
Lessons on What Drives&#13;
Demand for Improved Sanitation&#13;
&#13;
This field note summarizes the findings of an assessment on the impact of sanitation technologies in&#13;
Kenyan households and the factors that have influenced demand for the type of technologies used&#13;
presently and in the past. It also seeks lessons for future strategies for achieving sustainable sanitation.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  Limited financial resources are reported as the major constraint to the large-scale adoption of&#13;
  sanitation technologies. The study also identified that a lack of awareness about sanitation and&#13;
  hygiene, and how to construct and maintain pit latrines, do hinder sanitation coverage.&#13;

     Excreta Disposal Practices&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The communities selected have different excreta&#13;
     disposal practices some of which are influenced by&#13;
     traditional beliefs. The Digo in Kwale are mainly Muslims&#13;
     and their excreta disposal practice is influenced by&#13;
     availability of water and the belief that people are not&#13;
     supposed to excrete in houses (including pit latrine&#13;
     structures). The Kikuyu community believes that an&#13;
     improved excreta disposal facility enhances one's image&#13;
     in the society. It is also culturally accepted that if one&#13;
     wants to build a house, one starts by building a latrine&#13;
     for use by the builders. Nyeri district therefore enjoys&#13;
     the highest coverage of sanitation facilities in the&#13;
     country. The Masai are a pastoral people moving with&#13;
     their cattle to find new pastures. They do not build&#13;
     toilets, but have been known to use them in the vicinity&#13;
     of watering holes where they temporarily congregate.&#13;
                                                                   Abandoned open air toilet in the Masai area of Kjiado.&#13;

The population of Kenya is projected&#13;
to increase dramatically over the&#13;
next two-and-half decades, doubling&#13;
by 2025. Currently official figures&#13;
claim that sanitation coverage is&#13;
lowest in rural areas. The squalor of&#13;
informal settlements is more than&#13;
obvious. There is a pressing&#13;
need for achieving sustainable&#13;

                                       an important motivator. Finally,         privacy and convenience than&#13;
In colonial times, households&#13;

were forced by the colonial&#13;
administration to dig pit latrines&#13;
under threat of jail, and the Public&#13;
Health Act was enforced through&#13;
the chief's authority (in terms of&#13;
the Chiefs Act) primarily during&#13;
disease outbreaks. This was&#13;
reinforced by missionaries who&#13;
preached to their congregations on&#13;
how cleanliness (hygiene) was godly.&#13;
&#13;
In modern times, communities&#13;
are better educated and are&#13;
increasingly aware of the&#13;
relationship between good health,&#13;
hygiene and sanitation practices.&#13;
The sub-division and ownership of&#13;
land have contributed towards&#13;
increased demand for sanitation&#13;
facilities because most of the&#13;
land is now under cultivation&#13;
and the bush that provided the&#13;
much-needed privacy is getting&#13;
less and less.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, education motivated&#13;
the youth and men to acquire&#13;
latrines more than the other&#13;
groups, while prestige was&#13;
identified by youth and women as        A poorly constructed pit latrine.&#13;

 People mostly learn about sanitation technologies from their neighbors, public health workers,&#13;
 public meetings and community workers.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Factors that Hinder&#13;
Sanitation Coverage&#13;
&#13;
The main problems that hinder&#13;
sanitation coverage as cited by&#13;
focus groups were (in descending&#13;
order of frequency):&#13;
&#13;
1. Limited financial ability.&#13;
The inability of a household to&#13;
raise sufficient funds to&#13;
construct sanitation facilities&#13;
was mentioned in all areas as&#13;
a hindrance to the construction&#13;
of better facilities than those&#13;
currently used. Financial&#13;
capability was mentioned not&#13;
merely as a lack of resources&#13;
but as an opportunity cost&#13;
amidst other competing needs.&#13;
A household would find it more&#13;
useful to dispatch its able&#13;
members to pursuits that will&#13;
lead to the acquisition of other&#13;
basic necessities as opposed to&#13;
concentrating their resources               Even the poorest people have built simple pit latrines.&#13;
(money, time and energy)&#13;
towards sanitation facilities.              2. Lack of awareness of sanitation                  in education, health and hygiene&#13;
Filled up pit latrines are left             and hygiene. The study                              awareness and the demand&#13;
to overflow due to lack of funds            shows that there is a positive                      for sanitation facilities. Households&#13;
to construct new ones.                      relationship between improvements                   with members who had a higher&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The Poor are Paying for Sanitation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Although all focus groups indicated financial limitations as the main constraint towards achieving coverage,&#13;
     analysis shows that even the absolute poor still manage to afford pit latrines. Excluding the nomadic pastoralists&#13;
     of Kajiado, a breakdown of latrine ownership shows a surprisingly small range between non-poor (92%), poor&#13;
     (84%) and absolute poor categories (77%).&#13;
&#13;
     In addition, 62% of those who already own sanitation facilities were willing to pay to improve them further and&#13;
     more than 50% of those households without access are reportedly willing to invest in facilities. This strongly&#13;
     suggests that improvements on coverage and access can be made if the costs are kept low when local&#13;
     materials are used and the technology is right.&#13;

5. Flooding in low lying areas.&#13;
                                         a) Creation of health awareness         human waste.&#13;
Flooding is a major constraint as&#13;
                                         and training of community leaders&#13;
latrines fill up and overflow during                                             Furthermore, 39% of household&#13;

Quite often the latrines collapse&#13;
                                                                                 human waste as manure in&#13;

rebuild after the rains. In such&#13;
                                                                                 approve their families&#13;

     EcoSan Technology&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     EcoSan technology was first introduced in Kenya in&#13;
     the late nineties and there are now at least six&#13;
     projects in the country run by a number of NGOs.&#13;
     The technologies derive from work done in&#13;
     Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Uganda and Ethiopia.&#13;
     To date, the construction costs of most of these&#13;
     facilities have been subsidized by NGOs who have&#13;
     introduced three types of EcoSan latrines:&#13;
&#13;
     a) Skyloo&#13;
     (raised latrine with urine diversion and separate&#13;
     collection of urine and faeces)&#13;
&#13;
     b) Arborloo&#13;
     (with portable superstructure and no urine diversion,&#13;
     a tree can be planted in the filled pit)&#13;
&#13;
     c) Fossa Alterna&#13;
     (with dual pits and portable superstructure,&#13;
     digested contents of pit not in use can be emptied&#13;
     after a year).&#13;
&#13;
     Fossa Alterna and Arborloos work best when&#13;
     quantities of soil, wood ash and leaves are&#13;
     added periodically to produce a balanced&#13;
     compost. Skyloos require some ash to dry the&#13;
     faeces and increase pathogen destruction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                     A urine diversion toilet near Mombasa where the jerrycan is used&#13;
                                                                     as a urine container.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Skyloos                                         periodic (6-12 months) emptying of                Only 8 out of 15 latrines constructed&#13;

Several Skyloos were built in the&#13;
               oos&#13;

   The great majority of households are not aware of EcoSan technologies, although the potential&#13;
   benefits in agriculture and hygiene are well understood by the communities that are using them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the adoption of the Arborloo&#13;
latrine include it being affordable&#13;
and easy to replicate. It uses&#13;
locally available materials,&#13;
is easy to construct and&#13;
move (even for women), and&#13;
does not need a deep pit&#13;
which is helpful in rocky&#13;
conditions. Fruit trees can&#13;
be grown on abandoned&#13;
pit sites.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, as Arborloo latrines&#13;
are shallow, there is less&#13;
likelihood of ground water&#13;
contamination or collapse during&#13;
the rainy season.&#13;
&#13;
Lessons Learned&#13;
&#13;
(1) Historically laws such as the&#13;
enforcement of the Public Health&#13;
Act especially during epidemics&#13;
resulted in a significant demand&#13;
for latrines.&#13;
&#13;
The main current&#13;
motivation to build latrines is&#13;
increased health and hygiene&#13;
                                                                                     An example of an Arborloo.&#13;

                                                                                     about disease.&#13;

   The recycling of one person's faecal and urine nutrients can provide up to        Other factors include densification&#13;
   85% of the nutrient requirements to grow 250 kilograms of cereals.                leading to loss of privacy, and the&#13;

   Excreta is re-used by applying as soil conditioner on the farm. Fruit trees&#13;
   such as bananas, avocados, papayas, mangoes can be grown on                       (2) Most households that own&#13;
   abandoned pit sites.                                                              latrines were not provided with any&#13;

e. Easy to replicate&#13;

f. Offer safety, privacy, convenience.&#13;
&#13;
(3) Rural sanitation is a matter&#13;
decided by the household.&#13;
Because of cultural norms and&#13;
convenience, people do not like&#13;
sharing latrines.&#13;
&#13;
(4) The majority of households have&#13;
had little or no hygiene and&#13;
sanitation education. This may&#13;
explain why there is poor use of&#13;
latrines, and why many latrines&#13;
are not safe, do not provide&#13;
adequate privacy and&#13;
are unhygienic.&#13;
&#13;
(5) The main problems that hinder&#13;
sanitation coverage as cited by&#13;
focus groups were:&#13;
&#13;
a. Limited financial ability&#13;
&#13;
b. Lack of sanitation and&#13;
hygiene awareness&#13;
&#13;
c. Lack of knowledge on how&#13;
to build latrines&#13;
&#13;
d. Adverse geo-hydrological                This household in Kusa, Kenya has used excreta as manure to grow this tree.&#13;
conditions&#13;

e. Flooding in low-lying areas            the main constraint towards                     (7) The very great majority of&#13;

f. Nomadic pastoralism                    and observation show that                       EcoSan technologies, although the&#13;

g. Cultural barriers, which still exist,&#13;
                                          afford pit latrines. More than                  hygiene are well understood by the&#13;
but on a limited scale.&#13;
                                          50% of those not covered                        households that are using them.&#13;
(6) Although all focus groups             were also willing to pay                        The limited experience from small&#13;
indicated financial ability as            for improvements.                               scale EcoSan pilot projects reveals:&#13;

            Sanitation and hygiene in Kenya: lessons on
            what drives demand for improved sanitation
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This field note summarizes the findings
            of a field assessment on the impact of sanitation
            technologies in Kenyan households and the factors that have
            influenced demand for the type of technologies used both
            presently and in the past. The assessment was conducted by
            the Africa region of the Water and Sanitation Program
            (WSP-AF). Historical influences include decrees by the
            colonial administration backed up by enforcement of the
            Public Health Act. Today, the demand drivers are an
            understanding of the relationship between good health,
            hygiene and sanitation practices combined with densification
            which has led to a loss of privacy.
