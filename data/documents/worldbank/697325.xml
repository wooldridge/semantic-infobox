REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU&#13;
TRANSPORT AND URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:               Republic of Guinea-Bissau&#13;
Implementing Agencies:  Ministry of Social Equipment (MES) and the Guinean Executing Agency for&#13;
Public Works and Employment Creation (AGEOPPE)&#13;
Beneficiaries:          Ministry of Social Equipment, Ministry of Natural Resources, Ministries of&#13;
Health and Education, Municipalities, Communities, Enterprises and&#13;
Professionals in the construction industry&#13;
Poverty:                Program of Targeted Interventions&#13;
Amount:                 SDR 14.0 million (US$22.0 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:                  Standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity&#13;
Map:                    IBRD 26867&#13;
Project Objectives:     The long-term development objectives are to assist the Government in&#13;
implementing its sector development program for the period 1996-2000 which&#13;
aims: (a) to enhance the efficiency of country-wide transport and transit,&#13;
particularly for the movement of agricultural products; (b) to improve living&#13;
conditions in urban areas; (c) to generate employment; and (d) to improve the&#13;
labor skills and competitiveness of local construction, road maintenance and&#13;
transport enterprises. The project objectives are: (a) to improve the&#13;
management of public sector resources devoted to economic and urban social&#13;
infrastructure; (b) to rehabilitate transport and urban infrastructure; and (c) to&#13;
efficiently execute works by private small- and medium-sized enterprises by&#13;
delegating contract management to an AGETIP-type agency.&#13;
Project Description:    To achieve these objectives, the project would support development and&#13;
implementation of a sector-specific policy framework and three investment&#13;
components. The policy agenda is designed: (a) to increase sector resource&#13;
mobilization and efficiency of resource use; (b) to further strengthen the&#13;
institutional environment and disengage the Government from public&#13;
enterprises in the transport sector; (c) to improve the management of road&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance; (d) to promote the use of the private sector;&#13;
and (e) to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of the contracting of&#13;
works. The three investment components include a time slice of:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iv&#13;
A Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation Program (US$14.7 million or&#13;
49% of total base costs) consisting of: (a) a rehabilitation and maintenance&#13;
program to consolidate the priority network of roads, by providing for: (i)&#13;
rehabilitation of about 150 km of roads; (ii) periodic maintenance of about 90&#13;
km of roads; and (iii) regular maintenance of the priority network of roads&#13;
(about 1,042 km out of the 3,436 km network); and (b) improvement of two&#13;
ports, by providing for the rehabilitation of the maritime port of Bubaque in&#13;
the archipelago and at the tidal estuary port of Cacheu including quays and&#13;
berthing structures and low cost storage facilities.&#13;
An Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation Program (US$10.5 million or 35%&#13;
of total base costs) including water/sanitation, street paving and drainage and&#13;
small social infrastructure. The project will provide: (a) in Bissau for: (i)&#13;
rehabilitation of the primary network of the water distribution system; (ii)&#13;
rehabilitation and construction of critical earth and concrete drainage; and&#13;
(iii) implementation of a pilot solid waste collection and disposal program;&#13;
and (b) in Bissau and seven secondary market towns (Bafata, Bissora, Buba,&#13;
Canchungo, Catio, Farim and Gabu) for: (i) street improvements, paving and&#13;
drainage; and (ii) rehabilitation and construction of small economic and social&#13;
infrastructure such as primary schools, basic health centers, neighborhood&#13;
markets, slaughter houses and small terminals for inter-city transport.&#13;
A Capacity Building Program (US$4.1 million or 13% of total base costs)&#13;
aiming at: (a) strengthening capacity in policy-making, sector management,&#13;
planning and regulation through: (i) local in-service training sessions and&#13;
short-term training in "Highway Design Maintenance" for MES staff; (ii)&#13;
consulting services; (iii) studies and preparation of a future sector investment&#13;
projects; (iv) remodeling of existing facilities in the MES complex; and (v)&#13;
purchase of office equipment including computers, supplies and vehicles for&#13;
the three departments of MES; (b) strengthening the capacity of contractors,&#13;
engineers and architects having won contracts through the project; and (c)&#13;
increasing community participation.&#13;
The use of an AGETIP-type contract management agency will address the&#13;
lack of competition in construction, inefficient procurement and payment&#13;
delays, and will create employment in urban areas through labor-intensive&#13;
techniques.&#13;
Benefits:                Improved sector spending patterns and strengthened investment management&#13;
are expected to ensure maintenance of economic infrastructure. The project&#13;
will have direct social, health-related, economic, fiscal and participatory&#13;
benefits. Social benefits include job creation for unskilled workers through&#13;
the use of labor-intensive techniques; 20% to 30% of the value of the works&#13;
contracts will go toward wages resulting in at least 6,000 person-years of&#13;
employment. Health-related benefits include improved health and sanitary&#13;
conditions resulting from the provision of potable water and improved&#13;
drainage in poor neighborhoods. Economic benefits include lower transport&#13;
costs through the reduction of vehicle operating costs by 40% to 45%;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
v&#13;
improved access to agricultural areas, which, following project completion,&#13;
will no longer be cut off during the rainy season; economic returns (with an&#13;
average of 38%) from priority infrastructure rehabilitation operations; and&#13;
increased private sector participation in infrastructure rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance. Fiscal benefits include improved sector resource mobilization&#13;
and efficiency, thus enhancing the sustainability of future investments. Finally&#13;
the participation of municipalities, communities and the private sector would&#13;
be a major change for Guinea-Bissau since it will ensure ownership and thus&#13;
sustainability of investment.&#13;
Risks:                   There are three main risks which include counterpart funding, political and&#13;
institutional arrangements and cofinancing.&#13;
Regarding counterpart funds, the new Government may encounter difficulties&#13;
making its payments. To address this risk, the Government decided to use the&#13;
Road Fund resources for the provision of counterpart fund. To assist the&#13;
Government, a study on the Road Fund's administration will be undertaken&#13;
and a plan of action will be established to ensure the Road Fund's&#13;
independence, autonomy and management.&#13;
On the political and institutional side, the risk is the politically sensitive&#13;
reform measures, particularly for the privatization of public companies, and&#13;
reluctance of ministries, agencies, and local governments to delegate the&#13;
management of works contracting to the AGETIP-type agency. This has been&#13;
the case with other projects with a policy framework and with other AGETIP-&#13;
type projects at the start. Five features of the proposed project seek to address&#13;
this risk: (i) most of the more difficult reforms will be completed or initiated&#13;
prior to project effectiveness; (ii) the proposed project emphasizes improving&#13;
living conditions of the most vulnerable and focuses on employment creation&#13;
through labor-intensive works; (iii) a presentation of the AGETIP-type&#13;
agency was made in public and was well received by key decision-makers; and&#13;
(iv) a pilot works program will also be implemented before project&#13;
effectiveness to demonstrate the efficiency of contracting and payments; and&#13;
Cofinancing is expected to be confirmed before credit effectiveness. Strong&#13;
interest has been demonstrated by donors such as The Netherlands,&#13;
Switzerland and Japan. However, to address any risk of any shortfall in&#13;
cofinancing, the project components have been sliced to allow for the water&#13;
sub-component to be implemented once cofinancing is made available.&#13;
Furthermore, the phased, time-slice approach to small works would allow&#13;
IDA's contribution to be front loaded. The experience in other AGETIP-type&#13;
operations has been that many donors cnthusiastically buy in after the initial&#13;
demonstration phase.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU&#13;
TRANSPORT AND URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I.     INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    The Government of Guinea-Bissau has requested IDA's assistance in financing a time-slice of its&#13;
development program for economic and social infrastructure. The proposed project's principal objectives&#13;
are to assist Guinea-Bissau in enhancing the efficiency of country-wide road and river transport and transit,&#13;
particularly for the movement of agricultural products, and in improving social infrastructure in urban&#13;
areas. The development objectives include creating new employment in urban areas through labor-intensive&#13;
works.&#13;
1.2    The proposed project builds on, and is an extension of, the sector development program&#13;
implemented under the ongoing successful Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 2074-GW, US$23.6&#13;
million, FY90) and the contract management model of AGETIP-type agency under implementation in&#13;
several West African countries. The policy measures and associated investment program were developed&#13;
through dialogue with the Government and stakeholders, based on pre-investment studies financed under a&#13;
PPF, which led to the preparation of a draft Letter of Sector Development Policy (Annex 6) and related&#13;
investment components.&#13;
II.     COUNTRY AND SECTORAL CONTEXT&#13;
A.      Overview&#13;
2.1     Situated on the West African coast, Guinea-Bissau is a small country both in terms of land mass&#13;
with 36,125km2, which includes some 30 islands forming the Bijagos archipelago, and in terms of&#13;
population, with an estimated one million inhabitants. It is one of the poorest countries in the world with a&#13;
per capita income of roughly US$220 (1992 dollars). Other social indicators reflect a dismal picture of&#13;
pervasive poverty. They include a life expectancy of 39 years at birth, the lowest in the world; an under-&#13;
five mortality rate of 236 per 1000 live births (40% higher than the Sub-Saharan African (SSA) average);&#13;
a fertility rate of about six; and an adult illiteracy rate of 64%. About 80% of the population lives in rural&#13;
areas, most making a living from subsistence fanming. The agriculture sector accounts for almost 45% of&#13;
GDP producing mainly export crops, 80% of which are cashews.&#13;
2.2     Politically and economically speaking, Guinea-Bissau is in the midst of a radical transition. After&#13;
20 years of single party rule, Guinea-Bissau came under the rule of a democratically elected government in&#13;
the fall of 1994, for the first time since independence in 1974. On the economic side, progress towards&#13;
building a market-based economy has shown promise in recent years, although much remains to be done to&#13;
dismantle a well entrenched command economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
B.      Economic Performance&#13;
2.3     After false starts in the mid-1980s, the Government launched a far-reaching macro-economic&#13;
reform program in 1987, supported by the first Structural Adjustment Credit (Cr. 1798-GUB/A-26-GUB)&#13;
approved in May 1987, and the Second Structural Adjustment Credit (Cr. 2019-GUB) approved in May&#13;
1989. These Credits have supported a wide range of economic policy reforms which have notably&#13;
increased the role of market forces in the economy. They have helped stabilize the economy through&#13;
appropriate fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies; introduced price, trade, and financial reforms; and&#13;
improved public sector management. Their ultimate objective was to increase the competitiveness of the&#13;
economy and lay the foundation for the sustained longer-term growth without which raising the standard of&#13;
living and reducing poverty would be impossible.&#13;
2.4     Up until late 1992, the implementation of these two SACs was uneven, with policy slippages&#13;
characterizing the early 1990s. Since late 1992, however, the Government has shown renewed commitment&#13;
to adjustment which continued into the first half of 1994, allowing the release of the much delayed third&#13;
tranche of SAC II in July 1993, and the preparation of a third Policy Framework Paper (PFP) for 1994-97.&#13;
The PFP forms the basis for a three-year ESAF arrangement, approved in January 1995, with the IMF.&#13;
2.5     Progress was made toward restoring macro-economic equilibria during the period 1987-1993.&#13;
The fiscal deficit, excluding official transfers, has declined from 33% to 28% of GDP, primarily due to&#13;
significant restraint in government expenditures. This helped to check broad money expansion (annual&#13;
growth down from 138% to 41%) and inflation (from 87% to 48%). The ratio of external current&#13;
accounts to GDP fell from about 35% to 28%. Moreover, the Guinea-Bissau peso depreciated significantly&#13;
vis-&amp;#2;-vis the US dollar, thereby reducing the spread between the official and parallel exchange market rates&#13;
to 3.7% at the end of 1993. The debt burden, however, remains extremely high, with the debt service ratio&#13;
(before rescheduling) at almost 195% at the end of 1993. Despite the distractions linked to the&#13;
preparations for the country's first multi-party elections, preliminary data indicate that progress on&#13;
stabilization was maintained during most of 1994 allowing inflation to decline further to about 15%; the&#13;
exchange rate was unified earlier in the year. However late in 1994, there were slippages in policy&#13;
implementation in the fiscal and monetary areas.&#13;
2.6     Market forces are playing a greater role in determining economic outcomes, and key bottlenecks&#13;
to private sector participation in the economy have been removed. Prices have been liberalized, except&#13;
those for petroleum products and public utilities which are adjusted periodically to reflect changes in costs.&#13;
Trade distortions have been virtually eliminated with state monopolies abolished and import restrictions&#13;
limited to a negative list of goods for security and health. Banking has been overhauled with the separation&#13;
of the central, commercial, and development banking functions of the former National Bank. Privately&#13;
owned banks have started to operate. Export taxes have been reduced. Agriculture has been the most&#13;
responsive sector to policy reforms and is the main engine of growth, with production rising at an annual&#13;
average of 5.7% during the period 1987-93.&#13;
2.7     Notwithstanding the above progress, public sector management continues to be weak. In 1993,&#13;
tax revenues represented only 5% of GDP and total current revenues represented only about 10.4% of GDP&#13;
(the latter is only about one-half the average for Sub-S aharan African countries). Government spending is&#13;
still excessive, (slightly above one-third of GDP in 1993), and not well targeted. The public investment&#13;
program (24% of GDP) is excessively large, given the country's weak absorptive capacity. It is inefficient&#13;
as reflected in an average Incremental Capital Output Ratio (ICOR) of about 9 for 1991-93. It needs to be&#13;
brought in line with the country's overall development strategy, and requires more rigorous economic&#13;
justification. Budget comprehensiveness and transparency require that the public investment program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
(PIP), autonomous funds, and donor assistance be consolidated. Current government spending patterns,&#13;
analyzed in a recent Public Expenditure Review, indicate that the social sectors and infrastructure&#13;
maintenance continue to be underfunded and poorly managed, contributing to poor social indicators and a&#13;
deterioration in the quality of services provided to the population. Domestic savings have been consistently&#13;
negative over most of the period from 1987 to 1992, ranging between 6% and 18% of GDP, but showing&#13;
some improvement in 1993. Budget consolidation has not been achieved. Of a total of 46 public&#13;
enterprises (PEs), only five have been privatized, two have been liquidated, and eight put under private&#13;
management.&#13;
2.8     The Government is currently planning the divestiture of nine of the remaining 31 PEs. It has&#13;
initiated the bidding process leading to the privatization of four PEs. Also, recommendations to liquidate&#13;
TAGB and SILO DIATA and to privatize RODOFLUVIAL will be submitted to the Council of Ministers&#13;
shortly. On civil service reform, progress has been negligible with the ratio of public servants still at 12.5&#13;
per 1,000 inhabitants. Finally, the regulatory and incentive framework for private sector development&#13;
needs to be improved further, namely in the areas of land tenure and the financing of small and medium-&#13;
sized enterprises (SMEs). These issues will be addressed through refomns agreed upon in the context of the&#13;
1994-97 PFP.&#13;
2.9     External Financing Requirements. The Government's adjustment effort will require substantial&#13;
extemal assistance over the next four years. For the 1994-97 period, total requirements for extemal&#13;
financing, including arrears, are projected to be approximately US$941 million. Exports of goods and non-&#13;
factor services are expected to be on the order of US$223 million for the same period, while net&#13;
disbursements from existing and expected new projects, food aid commitments and the use of IMF&#13;
resources, could account for US$232 million. This would imply a financing gap, before rescheduling, of&#13;
approximately US$486 million over the period. This gap will be financed by a combination of debt relief,&#13;
additional quick-disbursing assistance from IDA, and SPA-related cofinancing and coordinated financing.&#13;
Debt relief consisting of eliminating arrears by the end of 1994, the rescheduling of pre-cutoff debt&#13;
amounts due in the period 1995-97 and at remaining current with the country's debt service due on&#13;
multilaterals, official bilateral debt and short-term debt, is estimated at approximately US$321 million&#13;
leaving a residual gap of some US$165 million for the four years 1994-97.&#13;
C.      Economic and Social Infrastructure&#13;
1.      Background&#13;
2.10    Constraints in the management of social and economic infrastructure are particularly evident,&#13;
even though significant resources have been invested in rehabilitation and modernization (on average about&#13;
45% of total PIP during the period 1990-93). Basic infrastructure remains inadequate due largely to&#13;
inefficient public resource management, institutional weaknesses, and a lack of transparency and&#13;
competitiveness in the contracting of works. As a result, important and productive parts of the country are&#13;
isolated during the rainy season, and transport costs are very high. Furthermore, only about 25% of the&#13;
population has access to safe water (well below the African average of 41%), and only 21 % have access to&#13;
sanitation. Water-bome diseases are common, especially during the rainy season, due to almost non-&#13;
existent drainage and solid waste collection. Endemic diseases, such as malaria and diarrhea, account for&#13;
more than 90% of the demand on the health system. Social infrastructure such as health and education&#13;
facilities are not adequately rehabilitated or maintained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
2.11    Guinea-Bissau is a low-lying country, drained by seven major rivers, fed by a network of&#13;
tributaries. Several modes of transportation are employed to move goods and passengers, the most&#13;
important being over-land transport employing a network of roads and ferry crossings, followed by river&#13;
and sea transport. Air transport is less important with one intemational airport and 17 domestic landing&#13;
strips of which five are operational. There are no railroads, nor are any foreseen.&#13;
2.12    Road haulage is the most frequently used mode of transportation both for goods and passengers.&#13;
In 1995, the number of vehicles was 5,241, including 3,898 private cars, 902 heavy vehicles (30% buses,&#13;
64% trucks and 6% tractors) and 441 motorcycles. Road haulage is entirely run by private companies&#13;
since the transport parastatal firm, RODOFLUVIAL, could not continue loss-making in this activity. The&#13;
road network, currently estimated at 3,436 km, is composed of 734 km (or 21 %) of paved roads and 307&#13;
km (or 9%) of laterite gravel, with the remainder 2,395 km (or 70%) being dirt roads. Paved roads are&#13;
generally composed of a laterite base and a double surface dressing which, if maintained, would be&#13;
sufficient for the current road traffic level -- about 150 vehicles per day on much of the road network. This&#13;
network represents a density of about 95 km per 1,000 km2 which is well above the regional average of 20&#13;
km/ 1,000 km2. While this would normally be considered largely adequate, if well maintained, to&#13;
accommodate the country's needs, the existing network needs urgent repair and does not cover economically&#13;
important agricultural areas which still lack reliable access, particularly in the south.&#13;
2.13    Port and river infrastructure consist of a new deep water port in Bissau which handles most of the&#13;
international shipping, plus 17 small river/coastal or estuary ports (seven of which are active). The present&#13;
capacity of ports is generally considered sufficient for the projected volume of traffic over the next decade.&#13;
Rehabilitation of ferryboat services is underway with the financing of a European Union program.&#13;
However, present publicly operated ferry services (comprising six major river crossing points) are&#13;
inefficient in delivering quality services and maintaining their equipment. Similarly, maritime and river&#13;
transportation run by RODOFLUVIAL cannot play its potentially significant role due to infrequent, unsafe&#13;
and poorly managed services. Since the publicly run company, JAPG, was dissolved, Bissau harbor has&#13;
been rented out for 25 years to a private company, GUIPORT; while the harbor moved from a non-&#13;
operational situation to a reasonable degree of efficiency, it could be more competitive if charges on&#13;
containers and merchandise were adjusted to better reflect the market. The shipping company, GUINE-&#13;
MAR, was abolished and there is now a significant number of private operators.&#13;
2.14    At present, one fifth of the population lives in urban centers. About 60% of the urban population&#13;
is concentrated in Bissau, the capital city, with the remainder living in 34 centers of 20,000 or less. Only&#13;
about 10% of the urban population in Bissau has access to safe drinking water by means of household&#13;
connections, and another 10% have access to public standpipes free of charge. For the remainder (80%),&#13;
water supplies are unreliable, unsafe or distant. They obtain their water from traditional dug wells which&#13;
tap superficial water tables exposed to contamination from poorly designed latrines. Less than a third of&#13;
the urban dwellers have access to basic sanitation services. Because Bissau is very low-lying, streets and&#13;
sidewalks are routinely subjected to flooding during the rains. In addition, existing infrastructure networks&#13;
provide unreliable service, are poorly maintained, and may soon deteriorate beyond repair. Many&#13;
community facilities, such as health centers, schools, markets and slaughter-houses do not meet minimum&#13;
hygienic and structural safety standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
2.15    Several agencies are responsible for managing economic and social infrastructure. The Ministry&#13;
of Territorial Administration is responsible for local administration. The Ministry of Public Works and the&#13;
Ministry of Transport and Communications were recently merged into the Ministry of Social Equipment&#13;
(MES). This new ministry is responsible for roads, housing, building codes, urban issues, airports, civil&#13;
aviation, ports and maritime transport and transit. The Road Fund was created in 1984 under the Ministry&#13;
of Public Works to collect road user charges. Tolls and licenses collected by the Road Fund are used&#13;
exclusively for funding road works and maintenance. The Road Fund has a separate bank account&#13;
controlled by the admrinistrative body set up specially to manage the funds. The Ministry of Finance&#13;
collects urban property taxes, and the Ministry of Plan and International Cooperation manages the overall&#13;
Public Investment Program (PIP). Natural Resources is responsible for managing water and providing&#13;
energy to all urban centers. Education is responsible for building primary schools, and Health for basic&#13;
health centers. Solid waste collection and disposal in Bissau is theoretically the responsibility of the&#13;
mumcipality.&#13;
2.      Main Issues&#13;
2.16    Transport and transit bottlenecks. Agriculture is the backbone of the country's economy. Since&#13;
undertaking structural adjustment, policy reforms have been enacted to establish a more favorable incentive&#13;
framework in the agriculture sector. In particular, inappropriate pricing and marketing policies have been&#13;
removed. While the sector has responded well to the new incentive framework, the medium-and long-term&#13;
performance will depend on the reliability and cost of economic infrastructure: road and river transport&#13;
and transit. While the potential for competitive production of cashews, fruits, vegetables, rice, and timber&#13;
exists, the current state of the road network, its lack of maintenance, and the unreliable maritime and river&#13;
transportation do not allow the supply-side gains to materialize, especially in the southern part of the&#13;
country. Vehicle Operating Costs (VOC) are excessively high; better road conditions would reduce them&#13;
by 40-45%. Moreover, the heavy rainy season has a considerable impact on the country's geographic&#13;
integration and transportation costs which fluctuate between US$0.11 and US$0.23 per t/km. Road&#13;
network improvements, including feeder roads, along with timely river transport services, are critical to&#13;
increase the competitiveness of exports as well as import substitutes.&#13;
2.17    Deteriorating urban living conditions. A combination of rapid urban population growth, at&#13;
about 4.3% per year, and persistent lack of maintenance of most infrastructure has resulted in a further&#13;
deterioration of living conditions in urban centers. Today, in spite of the ongoing efforts supported by&#13;
donors, about 60-70% of urban residents do not have access to minimal sanitation infrastructure (para.&#13;
2.14). This results in endemic diseases and cholera outbreaks which affect productivity and constitute 90%&#13;
of demand on the health care system. The erosion of basic urban infrastructure has further exacerbated the&#13;
plight of the most vulnerable. Government has been unable to cope with the demand and to develop&#13;
sustainable solutions to reverse the continued deterioration of living conditions in urban areas, particularly&#13;
in Bissau. The existing education and health infrastructure is not only poorly maintained but also&#13;
insufficient to meet the growing demand. The primary school enrollment ratio is declining and, at 52%, is&#13;
well below the SSA average. The under five mortality rate is about 40% higher than the SSA average. In&#13;
parallel, the central government is unable financially to meet these needs. Thus the capacity of&#13;
municipalities, neighborhood and user associations to collect user charges is critical to secure minimum&#13;
funding or participation for the maintenance of existing urban infrastructure.&#13;
2.18    Weak institutional environment. The infrastructure sector has lacked a well-defined development&#13;
policy with clearly established objectives, responsibilities and resource mobilization. The institutional&#13;
framework inherited from the past was complex and fragile. Policy formulation and project management&#13;
need strengthening. Different government departments tend to plan and make decisions with little reference&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
either to each other or to a central policy. This is most evident in the areas of public works, transport and&#13;
communications, which play a major role in infrastructure. Until recently these areas were managed by&#13;
two different ministries (para. 2.15). Although the recent decision to merge two ministries into the MES&#13;
will improve coordination, the new Ministry still needs to proceed with further restructuring of departments&#13;
and definition of responsibilities. Skilled personnel are scarce in the public sector. Under the on-going&#13;
Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (Cr.2074-GUB), some progress has been made in developing a broad&#13;
sector policy and project implementation through the provision of technical assistance, but sector&#13;
management capacity remains weak. In the past, the tendency has been to allocate scarce resources to new&#13;
capital investment and to neglect routine maintenance, particularly road infrastructure.&#13;
3.      Main Constraints&#13;
2.19    Insufficient and poorly maintained infrastructure. Only 20% of the required funding has been&#13;
allocated to periodic and routine road maintenance. This contributes not only to increasing inaccessibility&#13;
to different parts of the country, particularly the south, but also leads to increased vehicle operating costs&#13;
(para 2.16). Given the Government's limited capacity to maintain infrastructure, there is an urgent need to&#13;
increase revenues from users, and to involve local, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for routine&#13;
maintenance and repair of existing infrastructure. In urban areas, water supply, urban drainage, and&#13;
sanitation do not meet the country's growing needs. Bissau is supplied by nine tubewells which draw from&#13;
a deep water table, with an estimated potential output of 15,000 m3 per day. This would be sufficient,&#13;
however, the output is limited by the total storage capacity of 2,000 m3 which is far from adequate. The&#13;
distribution network consists in large part of small-diameter asbestos cement pipes, and its obsolete&#13;
condition causes losses of the order of 50%. The water distribution network is not correctly structured and&#13;
in some areas the water pressure is inadequate. Streets and sidewalks in Bissau are routinely subjected to&#13;
flooding during the rains, because storm drains need replacing or regular dredging. Outside Bissau, there is&#13;
little basic infrastructure and the lack of any institution to manage the water supply must be resolved prior&#13;
to initiate major projects in the area of water distribution. Community facilities like schools, basic health&#13;
centers, markets, slaughter-houses and small parks require urgent rehabilitation and maintenance to arrest&#13;
rapid deterioration.&#13;
2.20    Institutional bottlenecks. Government continues to be involved in commercial activities and&#13;
companies (such as river transportation with RODOFLUVIAL, road maintenance with brigades, air traffic&#13;
with TAGB, and ferry services run by the Road Fund) which could be better handled by the private sector.&#13;
Low domestic resource mobilization, particularly from road users, imposes severe constraints on&#13;
government spending, making more efficient allocation to priority needs all the more essential. Chronic&#13;
underfunding of infrastructure maintenance is further aggravated by insufficient cost recovery practices.&#13;
The Road Fund, set up to finance road maintenance through user contributions has administrative&#13;
capability, but road user charges actually collected represent only 30% of potential revenues of about&#13;
$600,000. This is essentially due to low rates of user charges (for example, private gasoline powered cars&#13;
pay $9 a year and diesel powered trucks $22 a year), and low coverage of charges. On the administrative&#13;
side, the Road Fund needs to be strengthened so that it is a separate legal entity governed by specific legal&#13;
provisions, managed by a board required to publish regular reports.&#13;
2.21    Inefficiency and lack of competitiveness in contracting. Guinea-Bissau's private sector has the&#13;
capacity to execute a range of public works between US$20,000-500,000 equivalent per contract. Besides&#13;
25 contracting firms in the formal sector, about 100 tradesmen in the informal sector execute small&#13;
contracts or act as subcontractors for formal enterprises. Only the largest three to five entrepreneurs have&#13;
access to the public works market, while the situation is more difficult for SMEs. First, they are affected&#13;
by the cumbersome administration of bid presentation and security requirements. Second, they are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
handicapped by technical deficiencies such as work site planning, invoicing and stock and cash flow&#13;
management. These deficiencies are compounded by Government's cumbersome administrative&#13;
procedures: it takes about a year to enter into a contract from initiation of the procurement process to&#13;
contract signature. Problems are exacerbated by extensive payment delays to enterprises.&#13;
4.      Government's Infrastructure Strategy&#13;
2.22    The main objectives of the emerging sector strategy of the new Government are broadly to&#13;
remove the main sector constraints discussed above in order to provide services which would enhance the&#13;
competitiveness of the economy and improve living conditions of the population. The main principles of&#13;
sector development policy (Annex 6) to attain these objectives are: (i) maintenance and rehabilitation would&#13;
receive priority over new investments; (ii) labor-intensive techniques would be encouraged over capital-&#13;
intensive ones; (iii) privatization of industrial and commercial activities. In cases where that would not be&#13;
feasible, public-private partnerships might be considered provided that the private partner is put in charge&#13;
and given full responsibility for managing the business company; (iv) Government would focus its attention&#13;
on developing capacity in policy-making and sector regulation; (v) suitable pricing criteria linked with&#13;
strengthened cost recovery mechanisms from users would be established; and (vi) donor coordination would&#13;
be improved to ensure all investments fall within the overall sector policy and strategy. Concerning&#13;
maintenance of urban infrastructure, the Government's emerging strategy relies on the following principles:&#13;
(a) responsibility to secure minimum funding will be defined among municipalities, communities, user&#13;
groups, government and non-governmental organizations; (b) management will be enhanced at four levels:&#13;
(i) planning and monitoring of maintenance by the General Directorate for Housing and Urban Planning;&#13;
(ii) initiatives by municipalities; (iii) implementation of works by the private sector or communmty groups;&#13;
and (iv) quality control of works by private firms and municipal technicians; (c)financing will be collected&#13;
on a fee-for-service basis collected by municipalities and associations; and (d) ownership among&#13;
neighborhood facility users will be developed by involving their representatives in cost-recovery decisions.&#13;
D.      IDA's Involvement and Lessons Learned&#13;
2.23    IDA has supported the infrastructure sector in Guinea-Bissau with five operations: (i) in 1979,&#13;
the first Roads project (US$9 million); (ii) in 1984, a second Roads project (IDA/EEC US$8 million); and&#13;
the Port of Bissau project (US$16 million); (iv) in 1989, a Social and Infrastructure Relief project (US$5&#13;
million) with performance rated as highly satisfactory and fully disbursed in December 1994 ahead of&#13;
schedule; and (v) in 1990, an Infrastructure Rehabilitation project (US$23.6 million) with performance&#13;
rated satisfactory and with only US$0.3 million undisbursed as of May 1, 1995.&#13;
2.24    Over the past ten years, these projects have: (a) rehabilitated the Bissau wharf and four&#13;
secondary river ports; (b) upgraded half of the existing roads (paved and gravel) to a satisfactory or good&#13;
condition; (c) initiated labor-intensive, employment-generating community pilot works to rehabilitate city&#13;
streets, sidewalks, culverts, water supply and sanitation systems; (d) improved community services,&#13;
including about 270 classrooms, four high schools, three regional health centers, and four health clinics;&#13;
and (e) set up sites and services operation for about 200 low-income households. In addition to these&#13;
investrnents, the projects have laid the ground for improving the institutional framework, building capacity,&#13;
advancing divestiture of commercial enterprises and liberalizing transport.&#13;
2.25    Project implementation has been improving and five lessons can be drawn, including the need: (i)&#13;
to focus on a limited number of strategic objectives; (ii) to continue institutional reforms, particularly in the&#13;
privatization of industrial and commercial enterprises and in the development of public/private partnerships,&#13;
and build local capacity to promote and regulate sustained sector development; (iii) to rely less on ambitious&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
cofinancimg targets which may not materialize, thus necessitating project restructuring or the reallocation of&#13;
funds to complete components; (iv) to ensure that actions to provide expected domestic financing are taken&#13;
so that sufficient and timely counterpart funds are made available; and (v) to streamline procurement,&#13;
contracting and payment procedures which impede the participation of local SMEs.&#13;
2.26    Other lessons applicable to the proposed operation are drawn from the evolving experience of&#13;
AGETIP-type projects in Western Africa. Those projects are based on the creation of a commercial non-&#13;
governmental organization set up to carry out contract management services for the implementation of&#13;
well-selected, economic public works and services program using labor-intensive techniques -- which has&#13;
proved very efficient in providing employment and subsistence to unskilled workers and, at the same time,&#13;
achieving durable economic benefits. At the beginning of 1995, there were 11 projects completed or under&#13;
implementation (two in Senegal and one each in Mali, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Niger, The Gambia,&#13;
Benin, Togo, Chad, and Madagascar). The lessons from the first Senegal Public Works and Employment&#13;
Project (Cr.2075-SE), incorporated into the design of the Senegal II operation (Cr.2369-SE), show the&#13;
importance of: (a) adequate dissemination and community participation for maintaining completed works;&#13;
(b) strong coordination of all actors through the preparation of a detailed annual work program; (c) an&#13;
agreed, detailed Procedures Manual to ensure effective and transparent implementation; (d) a regular,&#13;
standardized and reliable computerized management system for project reporting and monitoring; (e) a&#13;
strong covenant linking the review of subproject batches to the actual disbursement of counterpart funding;&#13;
and (g) application of commercial management methods and private sector staffing.&#13;
2.27    On the macro-economic side, SACs I &amp; II have played a major role in helping the authorities to&#13;
carry out important reforms, and the reforms contemplated under these two operations have been&#13;
implemented, albeit with some delays. However, the adjustment process is far from complete. Further&#13;
actions are required in public resource management, domestic resource mobilization, public enterprise&#13;
reform, and legal and regulatory reforms. In designing the policy reform program, experience shows the&#13;
need to be selective given the weak institutional capacity and low skills available.&#13;
E.      Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
1.      Bank Group Assistance Strategy&#13;
2.28    A Country Assistance Strategy for Guinea-Bissau was presented to the Board together with the&#13;
Social Sectors Project (Cr.2465-GUB) in February 1993 before the new multi-party government was&#13;
installed. The thrust of the strategy is to support policies and expenditure patterns that promote efficient&#13;
and sustainable growth, while improving the provision of social services. The strategy focuses on: (i)&#13;
sound public sector management, particularly in public expenditure management and resource mobilization,&#13;
public enterprise reform and institutional building; (ii) privatization, to remove distortions to private sector&#13;
development, along with financial sector reform, and more efficient provision of infrastructure services;&#13;
(iii) poverty reduction and human resource development; and (iv) environmental protection.&#13;
2.29    The proposed project is the immediate next step in implementing this strategy. Getting the new&#13;
Government to develop the degree of ownership needed for their success will take time, as new institutions&#13;
re-tested and new political alignments take place. In the meantime, it is important to preserve the macro-&#13;
economic and project implementation gains so far achieved. In this operation the Bank would address&#13;
issues in resource mobilization and public expenditure management and allocation to relieve constraints in&#13;
economic and social infrastructure. On the expenditure side, the recently completed Public Expenditure&#13;
Review has led to a number of recommendations for improving public investment programming and public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
expenditure management and for rationalizing the sectoral allocation of expenditure. This operation will&#13;
support implementation of these measures and recommendations.&#13;
2.30    Social and economic infrastructure provides an appropriate target for IDA assistance for four&#13;
major reasons:&#13;
(a)     The sector accounts for about 45% of the public investment budget, but only about 2%&#13;
of the public recurrent budget. Better targeting of resource use to provide for routine&#13;
and periodic infrastructure maintenance, encouraging a greater role for the private&#13;
sector in carrying out infrastructure projects, and strengthening the institutional and&#13;
policy framework will help reduce the costs of doing business, increase the&#13;
competitiveness of the economy and provide more efficient basic social services;&#13;
(b)     The present poor state of roads slows down the supply response in the agriculture&#13;
sector. For example, for cashew nuts (80% total export earnings), transport costs&#13;
amount to about 15% of total costs. Improving access to important and productive&#13;
parts of the country during the rainy season (June-October) will increase farmers&#13;
incomes and improve competitiveness of the sector;&#13;
(c)     Inefficient river transportation, ferry boats services, and road maintenance services will&#13;
be transferred to the private sector under the current operation. Ferries will be&#13;
privatized and road maintenance brigades will be dismantled to allow SMEs to&#13;
participate. Two existing PEs are slated for liquidation: TAGB (airline company) and&#13;
SILO DIATA (urban bus company which has ceased its activities) while&#13;
RODOFLUVIAL's road transport activities will be shut down and maritime transport&#13;
activities will be privatized. TRANSTER's exclusive right to operate bus service will&#13;
be reviewed under the current operation and the issue of State shareholding in&#13;
TRANSTER will also be addressed. The competitiveness of the BISSAU port also&#13;
needs to be addressed and current operation and taxes/charges need to be adjusted as to&#13;
ensure that there is no significant over/under charges in Bissau in comparison with&#13;
Dakar, Banjul, Praia and Conakry; and&#13;
(d)     Visible results in terms of employment creation and improvement in living conditions&#13;
through improved availability of potable water and sanitation facilities will build&#13;
political support for reform and encourage the authorities to address forcefully the&#13;
remainder of the adjustment agenda.&#13;
2.31    The proposed project would have a significant impact, but it is not designed to address all the&#13;
weaknesses in public sector management listed in para 2. 18. This is a conscious choice, justified by the&#13;
limited institutional and implementation capabilities of the Government. Rather than launching an&#13;
adjustment operations infrastructure/transport sector, with the risks of protracted implementation, the&#13;
project is designed to improve resource management and support reforms in a key sector, while undertaking&#13;
much needed investments using the AGETIP-type model which has demonstrated its efficiency elsewhere in&#13;
the sub-region. This would maximize the impact of the next stage in the adjustment process. To further&#13;
deepen the policy agenda supported through the present project, economy-wide structural reforms in private&#13;
sector development, agriculture, health, and education are required. The policy dialogue on such reforms is&#13;
ongoing and will be supported through planned future operations in these sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
2.      Rationale for a Sector-Specific Policy Framework&#13;
2.32    Despite the urgent nature of project interventions in priority road network and urban social&#13;
infrastructure, the Government wishes to establish sectoral development on a sound long-term policy&#13;
framework so as to address structural problems in a sector where the traditional intervention is investment&#13;
lending. The sector-specific policy framework promoted through this project in the planning, programming&#13;
and management of funds used for economic and social infrastructure would make a significant&#13;
contribution to better public resource management while eliminating key physical bottlenecks to the supply&#13;
response in agriculture. The investment would allow the Government to demonstrate the creation of jobs&#13;
rapidly, by emphasizing labor-intensive techniques and an increased use of local resources. This would&#13;
increase popular support for future reforms, a critical concem given the fragile, political and economic&#13;
situation of Guinea-Bissau. The synergy between sector-specific policy reforms and investments achieved&#13;
would increase the effectiveness of the operation.&#13;
2.33    In this evolving political and social climate, the challenge for IDA is to help Guinea-Bissau&#13;
maintain the reform momentum, without over-stretching the Government's capacity, rendered fragile by the&#13;
new institutional arrangements put in place since the elections. The proposed operation promotes the more&#13;
efficient use of public resources and increases access to, and the sustainabilty and quality of, basic&#13;
infrastructure. It will improve access to isolated geographic areas of economic importance, increase the&#13;
competitiveness of exports, and address the need of the most vulnerable groups through employment&#13;
creation and the rehabilitation of social infrastructure. Its overarching objectives are to maintain the&#13;
promising results achieved in restoring macro-economic equilibria and to help translate these results into&#13;
sustained economic growth and visible improvement in the standard of living.&#13;
III.    THE PROJECT&#13;
A.      Objectives&#13;
3.1     The long-term development objectives are to assist the Government in implementing its sector&#13;
development program for the period 1996-2000 which aims: (a) to enhance the efficiency of country-wide&#13;
transport and transit, particularly for the movement of agricultural products; (b) to improve living&#13;
conditions in urban areas, particularly of the poor and shore up municipality participation; (c) to generate&#13;
employment; (d) to improve the labor skills and competitiveness of construction enterprises, road&#13;
maintenance and transport enterprises by developing their capacity to respond to opportunities for works&#13;
after project completion; and (e) to benefit children's health and education, sanitary conditions and quality&#13;
of environment in urban areas.&#13;
3.2     The project objectives are: (a) to improve the management of public sector resources devoted to&#13;
economic and urban social infrastructure; (b) to rehabilitate transport and urban infrastructure; and (c) to&#13;
efficiently execute works by delegating contract management to a contract management agency. To reach&#13;
these two objectives, the project aims to address the three main constraints: (a) insufficient and poorly&#13;
maintained infrastructure; (b) weak institutional environment; and (c) inefficiency and lack of&#13;
competitiveness in contracting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
B.     Project Description&#13;
3.3     The proposed project is designed to assist the Government, first, to establish a sector-specific&#13;
policy framework which is necessary to achieve the project objectives, and second, to implement a time-&#13;
slice of: (a) a rehabilitation and maintenance program of the priority network of roads and ports,&#13;
Component A (US$14.7 million of total base costs); (b) an urban infrastructure rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance program, Component B (US$10.5 million of total base costs); and (c) a capacity building&#13;
program to strengthen sector management and planning functions, Component C (US$4.1 million of total&#13;
base costs). The use of an AGETIP-type contract management agency (para. 2.26) for implementation&#13;
would address the lack of competition in construction, inefficient procurement and payment delays, and&#13;
would create new employment in urban areas through the use of labor-intensive techniques.&#13;
Sector-Specific Policy Framework&#13;
3.4     The policy framework comprises a number of policy measures aiming: (a) to improve sector&#13;
resource allocation, mobilization and management; (b) to strengthen the institutional environment for&#13;
infrastructure and disengage the State from public enterprises in the transport sector; (c) to improve&#13;
management of road rehabilitation and maintenance; and (d) to increase efficiency and the competitiveness&#13;
of contracting of works. These measures are described below and summarized in a policy matrix in Annex&#13;
5. The Government provided IDA with a letter of sector development policy signed on May 15, 1995&#13;
(Annex 6 ). During negotiations. agreement was reached that Government will implement these policy&#13;
measures as part of the action plan which would be monitored during joint Government-IDA annual&#13;
reviews (6.3(a)).&#13;
3.5     Improve sector resource allocation, mobilization and management. The following measures&#13;
aim to increase sector resource mobilization, consolidate the budget, improve its comprehensiveness and&#13;
integration within the Public Investment Program (PIP), and allocating adequate resources to infrastructure&#13;
maintenance:&#13;
Sector Investment Program (SIP). To improve the efficiency of sector investments (para 2.20), the&#13;
Government will issue regulations: (a) to establish a three-year rolling SIP, to be updated yearly; (b) to&#13;
restructure and consolidate the budget to include all autonomous and donors funds; (c) to establish, by&#13;
region, budget line items to identify resources allocated for road, and urban social infrastructure&#13;
rehabilitation/maintenance; (d) to establish the responsibilities of all departments involved in the SIP,&#13;
including rules for investment approval and qualitative and quantitative criteria for public investment&#13;
selection; and (e) to adopt a minimum rate of return of 12% for a project to be included in the SIP, except&#13;
for social infrastructure. The regulations are part of the letter of sector development policy (Annex 6).&#13;
The action plan was discussed and agreement was reached during negotiations (para 6.3(a)).&#13;
3.6      Strengthen the institutional environment. The following measures aim at strengthening the&#13;
Government's capacity to manage the infrastructure sector, develop public/private partnerships, and scale&#13;
down the role of Government in the economy:&#13;
Sector Management. To enhance management and coordination of sectoral activities, Government will&#13;
define the organizational structure of the newly created MES, and assign clear responsibilities to each&#13;
department. The institutional framework and required related regulations was reviewed during&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
Divestiture of interest in publicly owned companies. As stated in the letter of sector development policy&#13;
(Annex 6) and in the PFP 1994-97, the Government agreed during negotiations that it will: (a) terminate&#13;
RODOFLUVIAL's road haulage activities not later than December 31, 1995 through the sale of its&#13;
equipment (para. 6.3(b)); (b) adopt not later than December 31, 1996, action plans with a time-table,&#13;
satisfactory to IDA, describing, inter alia, the modalities of privatization of the ferry services and the&#13;
maritime operations of RODOFLUVIAL respectively, and the fare and subsidy policies of the Government&#13;
in both activities, and thereafter implement such plans (para 6.3(c)); and (c) carry out a study to include an&#13;
action plan on the future privatization or liquidation of TAGB not later than March 31, 1996, and&#13;
implement such action plan not later than June 30, 1996 (para. 6.3(d)). Issuance of the Decree ordering the&#13;
liquidation of SILO DIATA and appointing the members of the liquidation commission responsible for&#13;
overseeing the liquidation of SILO DIATA is a condition of credit effectiveness (para 6.4(a)).&#13;
3.7     Improve the management of road rehabilitation and maintenance. The following measures&#13;
would establish the legal framework for private sector-led road maintenance and rehabilitation activities,&#13;
strengthen cost recovery practices and increase the allocation of public resources to road maintenance:&#13;
Use ofprivate enterprises for periodic and routine road maintenance. To improve the efficiency of road&#13;
maintenance, the Government will move from force account methods to contracting out road rehabilitation&#13;
to private enterprises and, where feasible, to community groups and users (para 2.20). Adoption of the&#13;
necessary legislation to dismantle the MES force account units carrving out road maintenance by offering&#13;
their equipment for sale or lease and redeploying their personnel is a condition of credit effectiveness (para&#13;
6.4(b)).&#13;
Revenue generation. To ensure the availability of the required funding for road maintenance (para 2.20),&#13;
the Government agreed during negotiations that it will: (a) take all measures required to increase the&#13;
annual revenues of the Road Fund from the current level in pesos equivalent to $555,000 in FY 1996,&#13;
$580,000 in FY 1997, $595,000 in FY 1998 and $600,000 in FY 1999), (b) ensure that the proceeds of the&#13;
Road Fund are used solely to defray the cost of road maintenance work programs acceptable to IDA, (c)&#13;
have the Road Fund accounts and records for each FY audited in accordance with appropriate auditing&#13;
principles consistently applied by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. (d) by March 31 of each year&#13;
submit the audit report to IDA for review and comment; and (e) by the end of each calendar year, submit to&#13;
IDA for review and comments a report on the collection and use of the Road Fund revenues (para. 6.3 (f)).&#13;
Adoption of revenue-generating regulations to adjust the rates of charges to be collected by the Road Fund&#13;
from the road users to ensure that revenues are at least US$555,000 equivalent in the first year of project&#13;
implementation is a condition of credit effectiveness (paras 6.4(c)). Evidence, satisfactory to IDA, that&#13;
revenue-generating measures have been implemented to ensure that they are satisfactorily collected will be&#13;
monitored at joint Government-IDA annual reviews.&#13;
3.8     Increase efficiency and the competitiveness of contracting. To implement the investment&#13;
component of the proposed project, the Government will: (a) delegate civil works contracting by setting up&#13;
an AGETIP-type agency (para 2.26); (b) streamline procurement procedures; (c) increase competition in&#13;
construction contracts; and (d) foster labor-intensive works. An AGETIP-type agency was created and its&#13;
Administrator appointed before negotiations (para. 6.2(b)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
Investment Program&#13;
Component A: Rehabilitation and Maintenance Program of the Priority Network of Roads and Ports&#13;
3.9     This component will help consolidate and maintain, in a sustainable manner, the priority network&#13;
of roads and ports by the year 2000 by supporting: (a) the remaining rehabilitation needs initiated under&#13;
the on-going Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project as well as other donors; (b) urgent periodic road&#13;
maintenance; (c) the introduction of routine road maintenance on a regular basis; and (d) essential&#13;
rehabilitation of the ports of Bubaque and Cacheu.&#13;
3.10    The road network is composed of 3,436 km of which 2,395 km are rural tracks. On the basis&#13;
of a study conducted in 1995 -- using the Highway Design Maintenance III (HDM III) method -- the&#13;
Government retained a priority network of 1,042 km which represents 40% of the classified network. Out&#13;
of 1,042 km of the priority network, 735 km (or 70%) are paved roads with the remainder composed of&#13;
307 km of dirt road. This network also includes river crossings and the maritime liaisons necessary to&#13;
transport agricultural products from production centers to market. As rehabilitation needs for ferryboats&#13;
and ramps are being covered under EU financing, the project concentrates on roads which have a high rate&#13;
of return -- between 20% and 61% with an average of 38%. The project provides for: (i) the&#13;
rehabilitation of about 150 km of roads (74 km paved and 76 km of earth roads), including all the&#13;
necessary engineering structures such as service bays, inverts, culverts or small bridges; (ii) the periodic&#13;
maintenance of about 91 km of roads (or about 68 km paved and about 23 km of dirt roads), including&#13;
improvement of road pavement by scarification, grading and shoulder regravelling, and engineering&#13;
structures; and (iii) rehabilitation of the island port of Bubaque, essential for linking the Bijagos&#13;
archipelago and the continental part of the country, and rehabilitation of the port of Cacheu on the Cacheu&#13;
river, including improvement of the quay and berthing structure and construction of low cost storage&#13;
facilities related to commercial, industrial and tourism development activities.&#13;
Funding under the capacity building component (para 3.18) is also provided for training and&#13;
technical support to local contractors and professionals of the construction industry (such as architects,&#13;
engineers, technicians, land surveyors and quantity surveyors) to increase the technical and managerial&#13;
capacity of small and medium-sized firms of the construction industry involved in the subprojects. Key&#13;
performance indicators are in Annex 7. The inventory of the first year program, acceptable to IDA, was&#13;
confirmed during appraisal (Annex 8A); its adoption by the Government is a condition of credit&#13;
effectiveness (para 6.4(d)).&#13;
3.11    Road maintenance will be carried out based on the following principles: (a) responsibility will&#13;
be defined by establishing clear assignments among different government departments and agencies; (b)&#13;
management would be enhanced at four levels: (i) planning and monitoring of maintenance by the&#13;
Directorate for roads; (ii) Road Fund administration; (iii) procedures for contracting out to the private&#13;
sector or community groups; and (iv) quality control of works; (c) financing would be collected on a fee-&#13;
for-service basis collected by the Road Fund; and (d) ownership among road users would be developed by&#13;
involving them in the cost-recovery discussions and management of the Road Fund established as a trust&#13;
fund and managed by SMEs. The management of the Road Fund is critical for the financing of periodic&#13;
and routine road maintenance. In the past, it has collected meager resources due to low charges and&#13;
exemptions of charges granted to a large number of users. A study on the Road Fund's administration will&#13;
be carried out no later than six months after credit effectiveness to ensure the Road Fund's autonomy,&#13;
transparency and management. Selection of consultants (with terms of reference and selection process&#13;
satisfactory to IDA) is a condition of credit effectiveness (para. 6.4(e)). On the basis of this&#13;
recommendations of the study, the Government agreed during negotiations that it will: (i) adopt, not later&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
recommendations of the study, the Government agreed during negotiations that it will: (i) adopt, not later&#13;
than one year after credit effectiveness an action plan with a time-table, satisfactory to IDA, describing,&#13;
inter alia, actions and measures to promote the participation of road users in the management of the Road&#13;
Fund and establish specific legal provisions; and (ii) thereafter promptly implement such action plan (para.&#13;
6.3 (e)). The road user charges would be set to cover all costs of maintaining main roads in the priority&#13;
network. The Government agreed during negotiations that Road Fund annual budgets presented on a&#13;
quarterly basis, and satisfactory to IDA, will be adopted as a condition of credit effectiveness (para 6.4(c))&#13;
and annual audits of its use will be carried out (para. 3.7 and 4.13). The project will provide for routine&#13;
maintenance of the priority network consisting of punctual interventions to proceed with cleaning out&#13;
ditches, filling potholes for paved roads, regravelling of dirt roads, grass clearance on shoulders, and wet&#13;
set barriers.&#13;
Component B: Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Maintenance Program&#13;
3.12    The project will improve living conditions in urban areas by the year 2000 through three urgent&#13;
rehabilitation/construction programs: (a) a water and sanitation program; (b) a street paving and drainage&#13;
program; and (c) small-scale social infrastructure program. All programs will be based on the growing&#13;
involvement of and consultation with the community (municipalities and associations) and development of&#13;
SMEs using labor-intensive techniques, paying attention to gender issues in labor recruitment. Funding&#13;
under the capacity building component (para 3.18) includes measures to boost systematic community and&#13;
municipality consultation through technical assistance in the form of information campaigns (using local&#13;
media and Information, Education, Communication (IEC) methods) and support for preparing feasibility&#13;
studies and technical project proposals. It will also provide for training and technical support to&#13;
contractors and professionals to increase the technical and managerial capacity of SMEs of the&#13;
construction industry involved in the subprojects. Eligibility criteria for the selection of subprojects were&#13;
reviewed and agreed upon during appraisal (Annex 10). Key performance indicators are in Annex 7. The&#13;
inventory of the first year's program, acceptable to IDA, with the application of these criteria, was&#13;
reviewed and agreed upon during appraisal (Annex 8B); its adoption by the Government is a condition of&#13;
credit effectiveness (para. 6.4(d)).&#13;
3.13    Water/Sanitation. This subcomponent was added during appraisal and represents a critical pilot&#13;
operation for the next water and sanitation project under preparation. It addresses the most urgent&#13;
rehabilitation needs in Bissau, which possesses an acceptable management framework for the sector and&#13;
concentrates on the most disadvantaged urban and pern-urban areas. It comprises: (a) urgent rehabilitation&#13;
of the primary water distribution network including: (i) renovation over a length of seven kilometers of&#13;
obsolescent piping and ancillary equipment in order to stem the substantial water losses through the&#13;
network; (ii) rehabilitation of four existing reservoirs; (iii) network interconnection and redimensioning by&#13;
laying about 2.4 km of new 200-250 mm PVC water pipes to upgrade the performance and raise the output&#13;
of the water distribution; and (iv) strengthening of the supply conduits and upgrading supply flows and&#13;
pressures by strengthening the piping (200-250 mm) over a length of 4.5 km; (b) rehabilitation of dirt and&#13;
concrete drainage, including: (i) rehabilitation of four outlets; and (ii) clearing of existing and construction&#13;
of new essential dirt and concrete drainage over a length of 2.2 km; and (c) implementation of a pilot&#13;
program for testing adapted and sustainable methods for solid waste collection and disposal.&#13;
3.14    Street paving and drainage, and small infrastructure. This subcomponent would be&#13;
concentrated in Bissau, but after one year, similar operations would also be gradually undertaken in seven&#13;
secondary market towns (Bafata, Bissora, Canchungo, Farim, Bafata, Gabu and Catio). The project&#13;
supports: (a) street improvements, including: (i) street paving for motorized and non-motorized traffic,&#13;
and related necessary drainage; (ii) sidewalks and culvert repairs; and (iii) construction of neighborhood&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
access streets and intersections; (b) rehabilitation and construction of small economic and social&#13;
infrastructure, such as primary schools, basic health centers, neighborhood markets, slaughter houses and&#13;
small terminals for inter-city transport and other facilities; and (c) strategic studies to improve investment&#13;
planning and maintenance of social infrastructure in urban areas.&#13;
3.15    Principle to ensure sustainability of Urban Infrastructure. In the current context&#13;
characterized by the absence of local/municipal tax collection, the maintenance of urban/social&#13;
infrastructure relies on the Government's new sectoral strategy based on clear assignments among&#13;
municipalities, communities, user groups, government and non-governmental organizations, better&#13;
management, financing through fee-for-service basis collected by associations and by municipalities, and&#13;
ownership among users. User charges would be set to cover maintenance costs. Community participation&#13;
will also be developed during the project by using community associations and NGOs. The Government&#13;
and IDA will carry out annually a joint review of Government, municipalities and communities'&#13;
performance in the maintenance of urban infrastructure.&#13;
Component C: Capacity Building Program in Sector Management and Planning&#13;
3.16    This component supports the Government's objectives of reinforcing the MSE's capacity to&#13;
better plan and manage its program, staff and resources, promote the private sector and delegate contract&#13;
management to the AGETIP-type agency. This will strengthen: (a) capacity in policy-making, sector&#13;
management, planning and regulation, (b) capacity of contractors, engineers and architects taking part in&#13;
the execution of the project; and (c) community participation.&#13;
3.17    The ongoing Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project has financed staff training, technical assistance&#13;
(representing 33% of total project costs) and logistical support for the MES's directorates to carry out&#13;
simple studies and supervise of works. A significant number of staff (about 1,050) paid by the MES are&#13;
carrying out implementation functions but few have the necessary skills to address sectoral issues in a&#13;
conceptual manner. At the time where MES Directorates' role is moving from routine implementation of&#13;
works to the definition of strategies and programming, MES has decided to reduce the number of staff, in&#13;
particular through the privatization of public enterprises and road maintenance brigades (para. 3.6 and&#13;
3.7), and to delegate contract management functions to an AGETIP-type agency, in order to reduce cost&#13;
and to focus on the MES's main functions.&#13;
3.18    To strengthen the capacity of contractors and professionals having won contracts through the&#13;
project and to increase community participation, this component supports: (i) short-term workshops on&#13;
business administration, financial management, work organization and labor-intensive techniques, geared&#13;
towards contractors, architects and engineers; and (ii) information and technical guidance to communities&#13;
(municipalities, neighborhood and user associations) to carry out feasibility studies, submit technical&#13;
project proposals and secure minimum funding or participation for the maintenance of urban infrastructure.&#13;
As a condition of credit effectiveness (para 6.4(0), the AGETIP-type agency will select consultants (with&#13;
terms of reference and selection process satisfactory to IDA), to deliver such training and technical&#13;
assistance during the first project year.&#13;
3.19    Project funding will provide: (a) for sector management: (i) local in-service training sessions and&#13;
short-term training abroad in "Highway Design Maintenance" for MES staff; (ii) consulting services to&#13;
provide institutional support at the central level to the three MES Directorates and to the cabinet; (iii)&#13;
short-term consulting services for assisting MES in the privatization process, carrying out a study on the&#13;
management of the Road Fund, annual and mid-term reviews (including beneficiary and environmental&#13;
assessment and technical audits), and preparation of future sector investment projects; (iv) remodeling of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
existing facilities in the MES complex; and (v) purchase of office equipment including computers, supplies&#13;
and vehicles for the three departments of MES; (b) for contractors and professionals of the construction&#13;
industry: short-term workshops on business administration, financial management, work organization and&#13;
labor-intensive techniques; (c) for municipalities, neighborhood and user associations: information&#13;
programs and technical support to prepare feasibility studies and technical project proposals; and (d) cost&#13;
of the AGETIP-type agency's services.&#13;
C.       Costs and Financing&#13;
3.20     Costs. The total cost of the project is estimated net of taxes at US$33.5 million, with a base cost&#13;
of US$30.2 million and a foreign exchange component of US$24.1 million. Price contingencies, estimated&#13;
at US$2. 1 million (or 7% of base costs) assume an annual domestic inflation rate of 10% in 1996, 8% in&#13;
1997, 6% in 1998 and 1999, and a foreign inflation rate of 2.5%; physical contingencies are estimated at&#13;
US$1.2 million or 4% of base costs. Table 1 below summarizes the project cost estimates. Detailed cost&#13;
tables are in Annex 11.&#13;

3.21     Financing Plan. IDA would provide US$22.0 million equivalent and the Government of&#13;
Guinea-Bissau US$2.5 million, with the remaining US$9.0 million covered by cofinancing. So far,&#13;
Japan and other donors such as The Netherlands and Switzerland have demonstrated a strong interest.&#13;
It is expected that these financing sources will be confirmed before credit effectiveness.&#13;
3.22     Government will contribute counterpart funding equivalent to US$2.5 million in half-yearly&#13;
tranches (Annex 15, page 2), between July 1996 and July 2000. Counterpart funding, as agreed during&#13;
negotiations, will be used for making payments of 5% on all civil works contracts (net of taxes and duties),&#13;
except for the routine road maintenance program for which the Government's contribution will be on an&#13;
increasing basis (5% during the first year, 15% the second year, 25% the third year, 40% the fourth year&#13;
and 100% the fifth year). Payment of a first tranche of US$190,000 to a commercial bank account opened&#13;
for the project counterparts is a condition of credit effectiveness (para 6.4(g)).&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

IV.     IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.      Preparation and Readiness&#13;
4.1     A local project preparation group, spearheaded by the former Ministry of Public Works and by&#13;
the newly created MES, was set up and was assisted by three IDA missions in 1994 and early 1995. The&#13;
project was discussed with the Prime Minister and with stakeholders in a workshop opened to the media, to&#13;
the ministries of Natural Resources/Energy/ Industry, Education, Finance, Planning and Cooperation, the&#13;
Municipality of Bissau, the Chamber of Commerce and the Transporters' Association. Agreement was&#13;
reached on the project objectives, scope, institutional reforms and implementation arrangements through an&#13;
AGETIP-type agency (confirmed by the MES in his letter No 104/GM/1995 of April 4, 1995). Sector-&#13;
specific reforms, consistent with the 1994-97 PFP, were drafted by the Government in a letter of sector&#13;
development policy and discussed with IDA. The public enterprise reforms were discussed with MES and&#13;
the Ministry of Finance. Project preparation was financed with a US$500,000 PPF approved in May&#13;
1994. A second PPF of US$400,000 has been established to set up the AGETIP-type agency, carry out&#13;
studies for the construction program of the first year, and finance the implementation of a small pilot&#13;
program. The creation of the AGETIP-type agency and the selection process of its Administrator were&#13;
completed before negotiations.&#13;
4.2     The project preparation group completed: (a) the inventory of subprojects for the first year's&#13;
portfolio (Annex 8- 8A and 8B) that meet the agreed criteria; (b) the selection of the pilot works to be&#13;
contracted after negotiations and; (c) draft statutes and manual of procedures of the AGETIP-type agency;&#13;
(d) the 1995-99 rehabilitation and maintenance program of the priority network of roads; and (e) a signed&#13;
letter of sector development policy dated May 15, 1995.&#13;
B.      Implementation and Management Responsibilities&#13;
4.3     Policy Agenda. Sector-specific reforms will be implemented by the MES, and monitored by the&#13;
Ministries of Finance and Planning and Cooperation. The MES will be responsible for reorganizing the&#13;
transport and urban sector while the privatization/liquidation of public enterprises in the transport sector&#13;
will be managed by the management unit for the Public Enterprises Reform (UGREP) in the Ministry of&#13;
Finance.&#13;
4.4     Components A, B and C. Implementation arrangements for effective fulfillment of the project's&#13;
objectives will be similar to those for members of AFRICATIP and will make use of delegated contract&#13;
management, while beneficiaries (Ministries, municipalities or communities) will have a key function in the&#13;
decision-making process through systematic client consultation. Works, goods and services will be&#13;
contracted out mainly to local private firms or consultants. All project components, except the&#13;
privatization program will be managed by the AGETIP-type executing agency. The agency will enter into&#13;
an agreement with beneficiaries to execute the specific subprojects. To facilitate implementation, the&#13;
project will provide funds under the capacity building component (para. 3.18) for: (a) focused training of&#13;
consultants and contractors executing subprojects to improve management, work organization, and&#13;
technical skills; and (b) information and technical support to beneficiaries. Government of Guinea-Bissau&#13;
has already participated in the annual meetings of AFRICATIP to exchange views on the AGETIP model&#13;
in the sub-region.&#13;
4.5     The executing agency. The Government has created the Agencia Guineense de Execusdo de&#13;
Obras de Interesse Putblico e Promo,cao de Emprago (AGEOPPE). The agency is independent, private&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
sector oriented and was initially set-up with the legal status of a not-for-profit company (see Annex 9). Its&#13;
board consists of an administrator and key stakeholder representatives (the Mayor of Bissau, the Chamber&#13;
of Commerce, the Transporters Association and a recognized civic leader). It will follow its own&#13;
procedures manual for bids and awarding contracts. The project finances 100% of AGEOPPE's start-up&#13;
costs which should not exceed 5% of the volume of works completed each year -- which is estimated at a&#13;
minimum of US$6.0 million during the three first years. The appointment of AGEOPPE's Administrator,&#13;
and transmittal of draft Statutes, By-laws, Manual of Procedures and Subsidiary Agreement between&#13;
Government and AGEOPPE, in a form and substance acceptable to IDA, were completed before&#13;
negotiations. Signature of the subsidiary agreement by an Administrator, acceptable to IDA, and&#13;
employment of AGEOPPE's technical, administrative and financial directors, with qualification acceptable&#13;
to IDA, is a condition of credit effectiveness (para 6.4(h)).&#13;
4.6     Operating procedures. AGEOPPE's operating procedures and internal organization include:&#13;
(i) eligibility criteria for selecting sub-projects submitted by local and central administrations for&#13;
implementation under the proposed project (Annex 10; (ii) procedures for calling for bids, selecting&#13;
contractors, consultants and vendors and awarding contracts; (iii) internal organization for supervision and&#13;
control of works; (iv) disbursement procedures; and (v) procedures for handing over completed works.&#13;
Based on the audits and performance indicators, the Board of the Agency as a commercial enterprise has&#13;
full authority to propose and implement any measure that will be deemed useful to ensure actual fulfillment&#13;
of the project's objectives, including the hiring and dismissal of the agency's management and staff.&#13;
4.7     Selection of subprojects. AGEOPPE will advertise widely the procedures contained in its&#13;
procedures manual especially as they pertain to the categories of works and services eligible to be financed&#13;
under the project. The agency will review the sub-projects that are presented by the ministries of the&#13;
central government and/or other beneficiaries such as municipalities or community organizations. It will&#13;
verify their eligibility based on agreed eligibility criteria (Annex 10) -- ensuring a rate of return of at least&#13;
12%, promoting intensive labor techniques and job creation, and having a positive impact on the&#13;
environment -- known and published in the Manual of Procedures, in order to assess their level of&#13;
compliance with the project objectives. After analysis, the portfolio to be executed for the coming year will&#13;
be identified. For the urban program, the batch of subprojects will generally comply with a breakdown&#13;
between subprojects submitted by Government and those submitted by local communities: (i) year one,&#13;
90%-10%; (ii) year two, 70°/6.30%; (iii) year three, 50%-50%; and (iv) year four 40%-60%. The&#13;
Government agreed during negotiations that the portfolio of selected sub-projects will be submitted by&#13;
AGEOPPE to the Government and IDA for approval, in annual batches no later than June 30 of each year&#13;
(para. 6.3(g)). After that, consulting firms will be hired to prepare bidding and technical documents to call&#13;
for bids.&#13;
4.8     Payment to Contractors. Since the project seeks to encourage the participation of SMEs,&#13;
prompt payment (not exceeding one week) is central for the efficient development of contractors and&#13;
consultants for the works or services they execute. The procedures manual allows the agency to give an&#13;
advance of up to 20% against bank guarantees. The private status of AGEOPPE allows its Administrator&#13;
to order payments, by co-signing with the Financial Director checks and transferring orders, without being&#13;
submitted to numerous clearances. The Government agreed with IDA during negotiations on a draft&#13;
subsidiary agreement stating that AGEOPPE, being an independent non-profit organization, has tax exempt&#13;
status and, therefore, subprojects implemented by AGEOPPE are exempted from any direct or indirect&#13;
taxes and duties, as per the Investment Code of Guinea-Bissau (para. 4.13 and 6.2(c)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
C.        Procurement&#13;
4.9       Table 2 below summarizes project costs by disbursement category and procurement methods.&#13;
No special exemptions, permits or licenses need to be specified in credit documents for ICB, as Guinea-&#13;
Bissau, despite the absence of any procurement law, allows Bank procedures to take precedence over any&#13;
contrary local regulations or uses. For ICB, the Bank's standard bidding documents for goods and civil&#13;
works will be used. National Competitive Bidding advertised locally (NCB) will be carried out in&#13;
accordance with the AGEOPPE's Manual of Procedures which allows that: (a) any bidders are given&#13;
sufficient time to submit bids (three to four weeks for contracts exceeding US$20,000 equivalent); (b) bid&#13;
evaluation and bidder qualification are clearly specified; (c) no preference margin is granted to domestic&#13;
contractors or manufacturers; (d) eligible foreign firms are not precluded from participation; (e) contracts&#13;
provide for security in an amount sufficient to protect the Borrower in case of breach of contract (without&#13;
distinction or exception); (f) prior to issuing the first call for bids, draft standard bidding documents are&#13;
submitted to IDA and found acceptable; and (g) award will be made to the lowest evaluated bidder.&#13;
Detailed procurement arrangements are in Annex 13.&#13;

20&#13;
4.10    Procurement of civil works, goods and consulting services would be managed by AGEOPPE&#13;
through specific delegation by ministries. The agency's procedures manual will detail procurement&#13;
procedures according to which the agency will select contractors and award contracts. They are similar to&#13;
procurement arrangements of AFRICATIP members and in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IDA credits. Civil works contracts of US$500,000 equivalent or more would be&#13;
through ICB in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA&#13;
Credits (January 1995). Procurement of civil works costing between US$20,000 and US$500,000&#13;
equivalent would be made through national competitive bidding (NCB) acceptable to IDA (para 4.9),&#13;
provided that the aggregate amount of such procurement does not exceed US$15.3 equivalent. For&#13;
contracts costing less than US$20,000 equivalent each, unit rates based on NCB for standard of small&#13;
works would be used. AGEOPPE will maintain a roster of contractors eligible for NCB, according to&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA and spelled out in the AGEOPPE's Manual of Procedures. IDA will review&#13;
and approve the prequalification and ensure that procedures are consistent with the Manual of Procedures.&#13;
Goods costing US$150,000 equivalent or more would be procured through ICB in agreement&#13;
with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995). Goods&#13;
costing more than US$20,000 equivalent but less than US$150,000 would be procured through NCB&#13;
acceptable to IDA (para 4.9), provided the aggregate amount of such procurement does not exceed&#13;
US$200,000 equivalent. Goods costing US$20,000 equivalent or less would be procured through&#13;
international shopping, provided that the aggregate amount of such procurement does not exceed&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent.&#13;
Consulting services financed by IDA (US$2.9 million equivalent) would be awarded in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. AGEOPPE will maintain a roster of&#13;
consultants for the establishment of short-lists.&#13;
4.11    Review by IDA. IDA-financed contracts for works and goods above a threshold value of&#13;
US$150,000 equivalent will be subject to IDA's prior review procedures. Documentation for contracts&#13;
under this threshold will be maintained for ex-post review by auditors and by Bank supervision missions.&#13;
In addition, for all contracts for which there are less than five bidders or for any decision not to select the&#13;
lowest bid, the awarding committee will submit its proposal to IDA for approval prior to notifying the&#13;
winning bidder. Prior IDA review will not apply to consultant contracts with firms selected from a short-&#13;
list estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent, and to contracts with individuals estimated to cost&#13;
less than US$50,000 equivalent, respectively. However, the exception to prior review of consultant&#13;
contracts will not apply to the terms of reference (or standard terms of reference) for such contracts, to&#13;
single-source hiring of firms, to assignment of a critical nature (as determined by IDA), and to amendments&#13;
to contracts raising their value above these thresholds (US$100,000 and US$50,000 respectively). Details&#13;
of the review thresholds are in Annex 13.&#13;
4.12    Procurement Arrangements. A detailed implementation schedule for works, goods and services&#13;
to be procured under the project was prepared and will be updated on a regular basis. During&#13;
implementation, all bid evaluation reports transmitted to IDA for review will contain an updated copy of&#13;
the implementation schedule. AGEOPPE will take the necessary measures to ensure that procurement&#13;
phases do not exceed the following target time periods:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
maximum number of weeks&#13;
* Preparation of bidding documents                    4&#13;
* Preparation of bids by bidders                      3-4 (6-8 for ICB)&#13;
* Bid evaluation and contract award                   2&#13;
* Signature of contracts                              1&#13;
* Payments                                            I&#13;
D.      Disbursements&#13;
4.13    The sectoral disbursement profiles for the region are eight years for urban projects and seven and&#13;
half years for transport projects. However, taking into account the results obtained in other projects using&#13;
AGETIP-type agencies in the sub-region, the project is expected to be completed over a four-year period,&#13;
with the IDA Credit disbursed over five years, according to the categories shown in Table 3 below. The&#13;
estimated disbursement profile is shown in Annex 15.&#13;

Total                   22.0&#13;
With a minimum turn-over of US$6.0 million -- which is necessary to keep the agency's services at a&#13;
reasonable cost (up to 5%) -- the volume of works to be completed during the first year is reflecting this&#13;
constraint. For this reason, preparation of bidding documents for the portfolio of the first year will be&#13;
carried out under the PPF financing. The IDA participation rates for each category and the disbursement&#13;
schedule was agreed during appraisal and will be confirmed during negotiations. A Special Account will&#13;
be established in US dollars in a commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA and with an&#13;
authorized allocation of US$1.5 million equivalent representing eligible expenditures financed by IDA over&#13;
a four month period. Monthly requests for replenishment of the Special Account, along with the necessary&#13;
documentation on expenditures, would be prepared by AGEOPPE and submitted to IDA by the&#13;
Government. Disbursements will be made on the basis of expenditures free of direct or indirect taxes and&#13;
duties. Based on the provisions of the Investment Code (approved by Decreto-Lei No 4/91 of October 14,&#13;
1991) and the general policy for projects in Guinea-Bissau, the project is exempted from any direct or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
indirect taxes and duties. IDA's share of the cost of project expenditures will be as follows: 95% for civil&#13;
works, and 100% of foreign expenditures and 95% of local expenditures for goods, and 100% for services.&#13;
IDA's contribution to routine road maintenance will be paid on a declining basis (95% the first year, 85%&#13;
the second year, 75% the third year, 60% the fourth year). If any change is made to the Investment Code&#13;
which has the effect of levying taxes or customs duties on goods and services, the percentage referred to&#13;
above will be decreased in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.08 of the General Conditions&#13;
applicable to IDA Development Credit Agreement. Disbursement of the Credit will be fully documented&#13;
except for expenditures valued at less than US$150,000 equivalent which will be made against Statements&#13;
of Expenditures (SOEs), certified by AGEOPPE with supporting documents retained for review by visiting&#13;
missions and for annual audits and semi-annual reviews by auditors. The minimum withdrawal application&#13;
size will be 20% of the value of the special account or US$300,000 equivalent.&#13;
4.14    Government's counterpart funds for civil works and routine road maintenance will be deposited&#13;
in a commercial bank account opened by Govenmment (see Annex 15). Government has decided to use the&#13;
Road Fund revenues for the provision of all or part of counterpart funds (para. 3.7). Payment by the&#13;
Government of the first tranche of US$190,000 is a condition of credit effectiveness (para. 6.4(g)).&#13;
E.      Accounting and Auditing&#13;
4.15    Consolidated project accounts, maintained by AGEOPPE following an accounting system based&#13;
on systems used in other AGETIP-type agencies, and the Road Fund accounts will be audited annually by&#13;
independent auditors, acceptable to IDA. Project accounts and audit reports (following intemational audit&#13;
standards and including management letters) will be submitted to IDA within three months after the end of&#13;
the period under review. Auditors will also: (i) express separate opinions on SOEs and the special&#13;
account every six months; and (ii) produce semi-annual reports on technical and management performance&#13;
of the agency not later than three months after the end of the period under review. The contracting of&#13;
auditors, on multi-year contract, acceptable to IDA, and certification by auditors that AGEOPPE's&#13;
accounting system is operational, is a condition of credit effectiveness (para. 6.4(i)).&#13;
F.      Monitoring/Evaluation and Reporting&#13;
4.16    Monitoring, Supervision and Mid-Term Review. Annex 7 gives the monitoring indicators for&#13;
transport and urban components to measure the project performance and AGEOPPE's management&#13;
efficiency. These indicators include the following: (a) number of agreements with beneficiaries; (b)&#13;
number of contracts signed with enterprises; (c) number of contracts completed; (d) percentage of&#13;
contracts completed on time and within the budget; (e) percentage of payments to contractors within 10&#13;
days of invoice of reception; (f) number of man-months of employment created; and (g) average time for&#13;
processing contracts. AGEOPPE will use the AGETIP computerized monitoring system developed for&#13;
other AGETIP-type operations. The project will be supervised every four months the first year, then every&#13;
six months thereafter. Supervision missions will consist of field trips to work sites to review financial and&#13;
management practices, bidding, and payments procedures, SMEs participation as well as maximization of&#13;
employment creation, the number of firms bidding and winning contracts and the number of firmns receiving&#13;
technical assistance. Supervision missions will also carefully monitor the environmental impact, as well as&#13;
the percentage of jobs offered to women. A mid-term review, including a full technical and financial audit&#13;
of the project, beneficiary and environmental assessments, will be conducted no later than two years after&#13;
project effectiveness. A detailed supervision plan is presented in Annex 14.&#13;
4.17    Reporting. AGEOPPE will submit: (i) semi-annual progress reports prepared by AGEOPPE;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
(ii) a detailed progress report on technical and financial project activities prepared by AGEOPPE not later&#13;
than four weeks before the date of mid-term review; and (iii) an implementation completion report (ICR)&#13;
within three months of the closing date.&#13;
G.      Environmental Impact&#13;
4.18    The environmental category is B for this project, which involves exclusively small scale, mostly&#13;
rehabilitation works. Most of the eligible subprojects will have a net positive impact on the environment&#13;
(on-site and off-site building and/or repairing drainage systems, soil and water conservation, and solid&#13;
waste collection). To ensure that the sub-projects' possible impact on the environment has been assessed ex-&#13;
ante, evaluation criteria are included in the Procedures Manual. Environmental analyses of each subproject&#13;
will be conducted prior to its authorization (Annex 10, criteria f), as this has been done in other AGETIP-&#13;
type operations in West Africa. Environmental impact for subprojects will be reviewed by an IDA&#13;
environmental specialist in annual batches prior to any adoption of the portfolio for the next project year.&#13;
The road maintenance and rehabilitation works will have little impact on the environment. The present&#13;
road alignments will be maintained, hence there is no risk of deforestation, property disturbance, or&#13;
resettlement. Technical audits will be conducted on environmental impact of garbage collection and&#13;
disposal.&#13;
H.      Poverty Category&#13;
4.19    The project is part of the program of targeted interventions. Its poverty reduction benefits&#13;
include: (i) increased farmers incomes by improving transport of agricultural products to market areas;&#13;
(ii) an emphasis on labor-intensive construction practices, in order to generate employment (6,000 man-&#13;
years financed under the project); (iii) training for local small construction firms to build their capacity to&#13;
submit bids and better manage their business; and (iv) substantial improvements in sanitary and health&#13;
conditions resulting from better water supply and drainage. The project will also have a beneficial impact&#13;
on the poorest by improving urban living conditions of the most vulnerable groups, and developing&#13;
municipalities' responsibility in maintaining basic social infrastructure. The project will include client&#13;
consultation and representation in AGEOPPE, beneficiary assessment studies at mid-term review to&#13;
evaluate the project's impact on beneficiaries including women, and to update the client consultation&#13;
process.&#13;
V.       BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A.      Benefits&#13;
5.1     Improved infrastructure spending patterns and strengthened investment management are expected&#13;
to contribute to a better balance between sectoral composition of investment, functional and regional&#13;
allocation, and ensure funding for maintenance of infrastructure. The project will also assist in&#13;
implementing the emerging infrastructure strategy and policies. Finally, the choice of a limited number of&#13;
well targeted and significant sector-specific measures should allow MES to launch reforms in a period of&#13;
political transition while staying within the bounds of its limited implementation capacity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
5.2      The project will have direct social, health-related, economic, fiscal and participatory benefits.&#13;
Social benefits include job creation for unskilled workers through the use of labor-intensive techniques;&#13;
20% to 30% of the value of the works contracts will go toward wages resulting in at least 6,000 person-&#13;
years of employment. Health-related benefits include improved health and sanitary conditions resulting&#13;
from the provision of potable water and improved drainage in poor neighborhoods. Economic benefits&#13;
include lower transport costs through the reduction of vehicle operating costs by 40% to 45%; improved&#13;
access to agricultural areas, which, following project completion, will no longer be cut off during the rainy&#13;
season; economic retums (with an average of 38%) from priority infrastructure rehabilitation operations;&#13;
and increased private sector participation in infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance. Fiscal benefits&#13;
include improved sector resource mobilization and efficiency, thus enhancing the sustainability of future&#13;
investments. Finally the participation of municipalities, communities and the private sector would be a&#13;
major change for Guinea-Bissau since it will ensure ownership and thus greater sustainability of&#13;
investments.&#13;
5.3     Beneficiaries. Implementation will improve the efficiency of municipalities and communities and&#13;
allow them to better plan future investments and their maintenance. The population, in particular the&#13;
poorest, will benefit from better drainage, sanitation, and roads, all of which will have a positive impact on&#13;
sanitary and health conditions. The project will provide SMEs with works contracts helping them to move&#13;
to the formal sector. Professionals from the construction industry, engaged in the preparing of bidding&#13;
documents and supervision of works, will benefit through formation and technical guidance. Subprojects&#13;
will also have a positive impact on the education delivery system.&#13;
5.4      Economic Analysis. No formal economic rate of return has been calculated for the entire project.&#13;
However, economic analyses have been systematically carried out for the rehabilitation and maintenance&#13;
program of the priority network of roads which accounts for over 50% of the physical works under the&#13;
project. For road repair and maintenance, economic rates of return range between 20 percent and 61&#13;
percent with an average of 38%. The results of the economic analysis using the Highway Design&#13;
Maintenance (HDM) method are presented in Annex 8. A detailed economic analysis is available in the&#13;
project files. In addition, other benefits include better road safety, reduction in vehicle operating costs,&#13;
lower transport costs by reducing vehicle operating costs by 40-45%, improve access to agricultural areas,&#13;
and the extension of the economic life of the primary road network. For the other investment component of&#13;
the project, similar projects executed in Senegal have had average rates of return of 21% in the areas of&#13;
sidewalks stabilization, 19% in construction of building, and 19% in small drainage. Sensitivity analysis&#13;
using an investment differential of 10% indicates that the subprojects remain profitable since the rates of&#13;
return obtained are 18%, 16% and 15% respectively. High rates of return would also be expected for&#13;
sanitation and other environmental works since such maintenance-type investments are typically viable in&#13;
other similar projects. New employment opportunities and increases in urban income would also be created&#13;
by the project. Job creation would be substantial (about 5,000 person/year) as large numbers of unskilled&#13;
workers will be required at construction sites, for both road repair and infrastructure rehabilitation&#13;
dispersed in Bissau and in other cities.&#13;
B.      Risks&#13;
5.5     There are three main risks related to counterpart funding, political and institutional arrangements&#13;
and cofinancing:&#13;
(a)     Regarding counterpart funding, the new Govemment may encounter difficulties making&#13;
its payments. To address this risk, the Government decided to use the Road Fund&#13;
resources for the provision of counterpart fund (paras 3.7 and 4.12). To assist the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
Govermnent, a study on the Road Fund administration will be undertaken and a plan of&#13;
action will be established to ensure the Road Fund's independence, user representation,&#13;
autonomy and management;&#13;
(b)     On the political and institutional side, the risk is the politically sensitive reform&#13;
measures, particularly for the privatization of public companies, and reluctance of&#13;
ministries, agencies, and local governments to delegate the management of works&#13;
contracting to AGEOPPE. This has been the case with other projects with a policy&#13;
framework and with other AGETIP-type projects at the start. Five features of the&#13;
proposed project address this risk: (i) most of the more difficult reforms will be&#13;
completed or initiated prior to project effectiveness; (ii) the emphasis of the proposed&#13;
project on improving living conditions of the most vulnerable and focuses on&#13;
employment creation through labor-intensive works; (iii) a presentation of AGEOPPE&#13;
was made in public and was well received by key decision makers; and (iv) an ongoing&#13;
pilot works program will be implemented before project effectiveness to demonstrate the&#13;
efficiency of contracting and payments; and&#13;
(c)     Cofinancing is expected to be confirmed before credit effectiveness. Donors such as&#13;
The Netherlands, Japan and Switzerland have demonstrated a strong interest in&#13;
cofinancing. However, to address any risk of any shortfall in cofinancing, the project&#13;
components have been phased to allow for the water sub-component to be implemented&#13;
once cofinancing is made available. Furthermore, the phased, time-slice approach to&#13;
small works would allow IDA's contribution to be front loaded. The experience in&#13;
other AGETIP-type operations has been that many donors enthusiastically buy in after&#13;
the initial demonstration phase.may not materialize. To address this issue, the project&#13;
components have been sliced to allow for the US$5.0 million water sub-component to&#13;
be implemented once cofinancing is made available. Furthermore, the phased, time-&#13;
slice approach to small works would allow the Bank's contribution to be front loaded.&#13;
The experience in other AGETIP-type operations has been that many donors&#13;
enthusiastically buy in after the initial demonstration phase.&#13;

3.7 and 3.11); and&#13;
(g) submit for approval the portfolio of selected sub-projects, in annual batches no later than&#13;
June 30 of each year (para. 4.7).&#13;
6.4     As conditions of credit effectiveness, the Government will have, in a manner satisfactory to&#13;
IDA:&#13;
(a)  Issued the Decree ordering the liquidation of SILO DIATA and appointing the members of&#13;
the liquidation commission responsible to oversee the liquidation of SILO DIATA (para.&#13;
3.6);&#13;
(b)  Dismantled the MES units carrying out road maintenance under force account by offering&#13;

TRANSPORT AND URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT&#13;
NOTE ON PORTFOLIO IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES&#13;
1.     Overall portfolio perfornance is satisfactory and is expected to improve further during FY95. At&#13;
the end of FY94, key issues which adversely affected overall project implementation included: non-&#13;
compliance with legal covenants (Energy project); and policy issues (Economic Management, Energy&#13;
projects)--these led to the overall decrease in disbursements (US$10.96 million in FY94 compared to&#13;
US$15.4 million in FY93). IDA did not commit any new funds during the fiscal year 1994.&#13;
2.     As of March 31, 1995, IDA's portfolio in Guinea Bissau represented a total commitment of about&#13;
US$59 million with an undisbursed balance of US$32.17 million. Agricultural Services credit closed&#13;
during the first quarter of FY95, and SAC II also closed on December 31, 1994, leaving the portfolio (as&#13;
of March 31, 1995) with five projects (Education, Infrastructure Rehabilitation, Energy, Economic&#13;
Management, and Social Sector). Although closed in December 1994, SAC II still has an undisbursed&#13;
balance of USS1.3 million which is included in the total undisbursed amount. The November 94&#13;
supervision mission assisted the Government in collecting relevant documents for completing&#13;
disbursements under this credit (SAC II).&#13;
3.     Out of five credits in the portfolio, three (Economic Management, Energy, Infrastructure&#13;
Rehabilitation) have encountered policy and/or implementation difficulties. The projects' characteristics&#13;
as well as actions taken to address the issues are summarized below:&#13;
Economic Management Project/TA (Cr. 2342-GW). Disbursement: 41% (about US$2.96&#13;
million). The credit became effective on October 20, 1992. To date, only about US$2.96 million&#13;
out of US$7.2 million has been disbursed. Disbursement delays were due primarily to the&#13;
uncertain political climate resulting from the long electoral process. A mid-term review of the&#13;
project took place early March 1995. The Government and IDA agreed on a detailed work&#13;
program and a realistic implementation schedule which will strengthen the project's&#13;
implementation progress.&#13;
Energy Project (Cr. 2237-GW). Disbursement: 10% (about US$1.55 million). The credit&#13;
became effective on April 17, 1992; and so far, only about US$1.55 million has been disbursed&#13;
out of a total credit of US$15.15 million. This project which received a less-than satisfactory&#13;
performance rating at the end of FY94, was reviewed in April 1994, and an Action Plan to&#13;
restructure the project was agreed upon with Government authorities.  The pace of the&#13;
restructuring, however, fell victim to the political elections which were held shortly thereafter.&#13;
The Government has been notified, in a letter addressed to the Minister of Finance on December&#13;
1, 1994, of the danger and implications of allowing the project to deteriorate further A&#13;
supervision mission is planned for late May 1995 at which time the progress on fulfilling the&#13;
conditions for restructuring the project will be reviewed.&#13;
4.     Among actions taken to ensure smooth implementation of projects in the portfolio is the&#13;
Government's efforts in securing donor support to provide counterpart funds needed for the Social Sector&#13;
Project.&#13;
5.     There are no outstanding audit reports for the portfolio. Procurement issues are well managed,&#13;
with procurement seminars held in Bissau routinely as part of a project launch and are attended by Project&#13;
Implementation Units staff as well as other government officials involved in project management.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU&#13;
MINISTRY OF SOCLL EQUIPMENT&#13;
LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY FOR THE SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR&#13;
PREFACE&#13;
1.    After gaining independence in 1974, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau passed through a phase&#13;
characterized by a single-party system and a centralized command economy.&#13;
2.    In 1986 economic liberalization was proclaimed, under which the private sector enjoys more&#13;
privileges and is assigned greater priority in the development of the economy.&#13;
3.    In 1991 a multiparty system was introduced and, in mid-1994, the first multiparty election in the&#13;
history of the Republic was held, marking the commencement of a new stage in the consolidation of&#13;
democracy and the building of sustainable development, in which the State and the economy completely&#13;
open themselves to the private sector in a joint endeavor by all components of organized civil society to&#13;
achieve the common objectives of the entire Nation.&#13;
4.    In the present phase, two parallel efforts will have to be combined: namely the formulation and&#13;
implementation of integrated strategies and initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable development, in&#13;
conjunction with the means, mechanisms and instruments to ensure that this implementation takes place&#13;
with adequate efficiency and effectiveness. This, then, is the context of this Letter of Development Policy&#13;
for the Social Infrastructure Sector.&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
5.    In recent years (1984/94) various projects have been carried out in the transport infrastructure&#13;
sector (roads, airports and ports), with funding from multilateral and bilateral cooperation sources. The&#13;
investments concemed have been in road, river and air transport infrastructure for the greater part, with&#13;
urban and social infrastructure accounting for the rest.&#13;
6.     These investments have provided Guinea-Bissau with transport infrastructure that is on average&#13;
qualitatively superior to that of other countries of the region.&#13;
7.     However, even though about 30% of the national general budget is allocated to the Ministry of&#13;
Social Infrastructure, there are still parts of the country where the road network is severely deteriorated and&#13;
deficient, especially in the south, where the roads are practically impassable in the wet season.&#13;
8.    This deterioration is due to the absence of maintenance policies, and establishment of such policies&#13;
is a priority for the Government that extends beyond routine maintenance of existing roads and the building&#13;
of new ones.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 3 of 14&#13;
I.     Overall Strategies&#13;
9.     The Government's overall strategies in the social infrastructure sector are the following:&#13;
(a) Increase the efficiency of the use of public resources by assigning priority to their allocation to&#13;
maintenance of existing infrastructure facilities;&#13;
(b) Reduce state involvement in the sector, primarily by harnessing private enterprise and by&#13;
privatization, promotion of initiatives and other measures that will foster free competition;&#13;
(c) Definition of sector policies and regulation of economic activity in the sector.&#13;
II.    Strate2ies at Institutional Level&#13;
10.    The Ministry of Social Equipment (MES) will give priority to activities entailing transferring&#13;
physical works to the private sector, while reserving for itself the role of regulatory agency through&#13;
its greater involvement in the defining and strengthening of the instruments for supervision of the&#13;
sector's activity. A policy of downsizing the MES's staff will accordingly be adopted, to which end&#13;
early retirement will be promoted together with transfers to the private sector, so as to prompt&#13;
creation of independent services and microenterprises.&#13;
11.    The necessary steps will be taken to redimension and reorganize the MES's departments so as to&#13;
establish the shortest possible lines of communication between central departments.&#13;
12.    As regards local government, there is presently only one municipal council, that of Bissau. In all&#13;
the other regions (eight in total, with 38 sectors), the Sector State Committees are currently&#13;
appointed by the Government.&#13;
13.    It is the Government's intention to proceed to organize local elections to be held in 1996, in which&#13;
the chairman of the committee will be elected by universal ballot, and will then perform the duties&#13;
of chairman of the municipal council that will subsequently be created.&#13;
14.    Between now and the elections the Government will draft legislation or set up a program for&#13;
transferring responsibility for managing social and urban infrastructure to the local authorities,&#13;
after which the Government's function at this level will be to provide general guidance and to define&#13;
policies and their implementing regulations.&#13;
15.    Since the country now has an infrastructure system that needs to be preserved, while the public and&#13;
private enterprises and NGOs propose to collaborate in the execution of new infrastructure&#13;
projects, the MES, when it prepares its budgets, will seek to allocate its current (public) revenues&#13;
to cover the maintenance costs of the existing infrastructure.&#13;
16.    Given the need for a system that can provide for the medium-term budgeting of MES activities, the&#13;
budget process will be reformed to enable implementation of a three-year budget that will be&#13;
prepared in conjunction with the ministry's operating and capital budgets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 4 of 14&#13;
III.   Transport and Public Works Sector&#13;
17.   It is the Govemment's intention to foster development of the private sector, primarily by continuing&#13;
to divest itself of public enterprises. Guinemar and JAPG have already been dissolved.&#13;
18.   A decision will shortly be made concerning the other public enterprises under MES oversight, in&#13;
particular Silo Diata, TAGB and Rodofluvial.&#13;
19.   The Govemment will take steps with a view to developing and supporting private enterprise to&#13;
ensure the satisfactory provision of service in the transport sector.&#13;
The actions that will be taken and the way in which the transport and infrastructure policies will&#13;
be implemented are described in Annex 1.&#13;
III A. Road Transport and Hiehways&#13;
20.    There are presently 1,740 road passenger vehicles in Guinea-Bissau, which handle virtually the&#13;
entirety of the subsector's operations; 14 of these vehicles belong to a mixed enterprise and the rest&#13;
to private operators.&#13;
21.    The Government will shortly complete the formalities in progress for the winding up of Silo Diata,&#13;
which in practice ceased operations several years ago.&#13;
22.    The exclusive right to operate urban transport granted to TRANSTER will be revoked, in order to&#13;
establish a legal framework for competition in the urban transport market.&#13;
23.    Regarding Rodofluvial's land transport activities, the Government will give priority to winding up&#13;
the enterprise's road transport component in light of the privatization policy and if the response of&#13;
the private operators in the subsector is acceptable.&#13;
24.    The MES will carry out a set of actions aimed at meeting road maintenance costs from current&#13;
revenues. It will accordingly adjust tolls and charges so as to cover acceptable routine&#13;
maintenance costs of the road infrastructure and will only undertake actions with an acceptable&#13;
rate of return (not less than 12%) that will have the effect of opening up areas with significant&#13;
agricultural production.&#13;
25.    The road policy provides for rehabilitation and maintenance of the priority roads with a&#13;
demonstrated return and of strategic importance for the development of isolated areas and for&#13;
spurring economic activity.&#13;
26.    As of 1996, the revenues of the Road Fund should, as a minimum, be sufficient to ensure full&#13;
coverage of routine maintenance costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 5 of 14&#13;
III B. River Transport&#13;
27.    River transport, currently virtually nonexistent, is one of the Government's concerns; it wants to&#13;
conclude agreements with private operators to provide transport services among the islands and&#13;
between them and the mainland.&#13;
28.   The Government will seek to mobilize national and foreign operators interested in investing in this&#13;
subsector so as to create competition in order to meet the sea and river transportation needs of&#13;
passengers and goods.&#13;
29.    Rodofluvial is currently the only enterprise providing minimum service between the mainland and&#13;
the islands; its operation will be rendered profitable by means of restructuring and a process of&#13;
gradual privatization with the awarding of concessions to national private operators and foreign&#13;
partners.&#13;
30.    The Government will take steps to ensure maintenance of the existing river transport infrastructure.&#13;
III C. Air Transport&#13;
31.    A study of the subsector and of its viability and regulation in the field of air transport.&#13;
32.    The future of the sole existing company (TAGB) will be decided in the near future, with opening of&#13;
its capital to participation by national and foreign private interests (TAP, Air Afrique, etc.) by the&#13;
end of 1996.&#13;
33.    Very recently, Guinea-Bissau's application to join Air Afrique was accepted and negotiations are in&#13;
progress on regional and long-haul services, assistance and the share payable in Air Afrique's&#13;
capital to be come a full member, after which the provisions of the Yaounde Treaty will apply.&#13;
III D. Communications (see Annex 1)&#13;
IV.   Urban subsector&#13;
34.    The national objectives of growth and socioeconomic development should be reflected in the urban&#13;
subsector through a gradual increase in the population's quality of life and enhanced efficiency and&#13;
effectiveness of urban management, both locally and nationally.&#13;
35.   The strategy for the urban subsector focuses on sustainability, and will be guided by an&#13;
appropriate population policy based on broad access to information that enables families to plan&#13;
and program their growth. In urban terms, such quantitative sustainability will be guided by the&#13;
ongoing effort to devise measures which, while not encouraging stepped up migration from rural&#13;
areas, will provide employment and housing opportunities to urban population groups.&#13;
36.   In qualitative terms, sustainable urban development will be attained through a process of steadily&#13;
improving families' access to basic and social infrastructure, with priority for the neediest segments&#13;
and vulnerable groups; information and awareness-raising campaigns to improve relations among&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

ACTION PLAN&#13;
BUDGET REFORM&#13;
In order to assess objectively the policies adopted for the sector in terms of short-and-medium term&#13;
planning and their degree of implementation, this year (1995) the MES will undertake a budget reform.&#13;
This reform will draw on methods used in public accounting in Guinea-Bissau and will take into account&#13;
changes now under way.&#13;
The MES will organize its annual operating budget so as to allow for a more objective analysis of&#13;
the efficiency with which it monitors allocations of its revenues and covers its operating and investment&#13;
expenses. The expenses will be broken down by amount, time horizon in which they will be effective, type,&#13;
nature, geographic area of implementation, and source of financing (loan, donors or public revenues).&#13;
There will also be information on several aspects, including: the degree of geographic&#13;
decentralization of investments; and assessment of the potential for current infrastructure maintenance&#13;
expenses to be covered by current revenues; share of investment sponsored by the MES in the various areas&#13;
of intervention (health, education, etc.).&#13;
In view of the ever more pressing need to plan for the medium-term future, and taking into account&#13;
the importance of controlling the level of national investments to ensure success of the structural&#13;
adjustment program, the MES will prepare a forward-looking Investment Plan with a three-year time&#13;
horizon, updated annually (Triennial Plan-PIP), which will include all the investments to be made by the&#13;
Ministry, subdivided into their various components.&#13;
Adopting the same nomenclature in the Triennial Plan as is used in the annual budget will make&#13;
possible a full linkage these tow management instruments, while also creating a basis for evaluating the&#13;
degree of budgetary execution and for obtaining information relevant to identifying differences between the&#13;
sums executed and budgeted.&#13;
The annual budget and the PIP for each year will be prepared by the end of November of the&#13;
previous year. Each year the MES will render a report analyzing the previous financial year, which will&#13;
include evaluation of the level of execution of the Annual Budget and of the PIP for the previous year. This&#13;
report will be concluded by the end of March of the year after the one referred to. The 1996-1998&#13;
Triennial Plan and the 1996 Annual Budget will be prepared and submitted to IDA using the nomenclature&#13;
described in this document.&#13;
By May 1995 all the legislation needed for implementation of this reform will be in place. In&#13;
particular, all the actions to be carried out will be scheduled, and those in charge of their implementation&#13;
and the resources to be used will be identified.&#13;

Page 10 of 14&#13;
Description of the methodology&#13;
In order to respect the decisions of the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Planning in relation to&#13;
public accounting and the triennial investment plan, and bearing in mind the evident need to monitor&#13;
implementation of the plan of the budget, the triennial plan should use the same general nomenclature as is&#13;
used in the public accounts. The degree of disaggregation used in this document is greater than that used in&#13;
drawing up the annual budget and seeks to address the information needs for developing infrastructure for&#13;
transportation, public works, urban development, and health and education, among others.&#13;
Therefore, for every action planned (rehabilitation of a road, or urban development of a&#13;
neighborhood, for example), an annualized budget will be drawn up based on the new economic&#13;
classification already published (circular series A, no. 1, of December 30, 1993, issued by the General&#13;
Directorate of Public Accounting). In addition to this classification, each of these "action budgets" will be&#13;
given a functional classification, in conformity with the plan of public accounts. This classification will&#13;
identify the respective geographic area of implementation and form of financing (public revenues, extemal&#13;
loans, intemal loans, or grants).&#13;
These procedures will yield the MES budget, obtained as the sum of the various "action budgets"&#13;
for a given year. The same logic will be followed in adopting the triennial investment plan, but taking into&#13;
consideration a three-year time horizon. Each action will have a global budget corresponding to the sum of&#13;
the various "action budgets" into which it was divided.&#13;
The dual classification (economic and functional) will provide a basis for aggregating the budgets&#13;
of the MSE into public budgets, plans, and accounts, and will also make it possible to ensure information is&#13;
available on the amount of investments made in each area (health, education, housing, roads, etc.). In&#13;
additional to these data, it will be possible to obtain information on the distribution of the investment, the&#13;
structure of ministry financing, and the area of intervention.&#13;
Another advantage of the budget reform now proposed is the potential for more objective&#13;
evaluation of the structural adjustment program. yet this evaluation will only be possible if there is also an&#13;
accounting, even if in suspense accounts, for all payments made, whether from public revenues or from&#13;
loan and grant funds. This rule will have to be respected without exceptions and is crucial for the proper&#13;
functioning of public accounting.&#13;
The methodology of the budget reformn described in this document should be supported by a data&#13;
base, which if possible should operate in a Windows environment. It will interrelate with the supporting&#13;
computer program(s) of the Plan, Budget, and Public Accounting either manually or by the use of&#13;
compatible dbase files.&#13;
This solution, given its versatility and simplicity once developed, also makes it possible, by&#13;
combining several pre-established criteria, to obtain a large amount of additional information.&#13;
The annex includes a basis for drawing up the "action budgets," which will be used in the annual&#13;
budgets and Triennial Plan of the MES.&#13;
Note: following are some examples of how to obtain the desired information from the data base:&#13;
The annual budget of the MES for year x will be obtained by consulting the base using as the criterion&#13;
(criterion 2) = 199X&#13;
&#13;

The Triennial Plan, based on an economic analysis of the MES from years x to x+3 will be obtained by&#13;
consulting the base using as the criterion (criterion 2) = 199X and 199X + I and 199X+2&#13;
The Triennial Plan of the MES in the health sector, northern zone, from years x to x+3 will be obtained by&#13;
consulting the base using as the criterion (criterion 2) = (199X and 199X+l and 199X+2) &amp; (criteria 4) =&#13;
Health &amp; (criterion 5) = N&#13;

ACTION PLAN&#13;
ROAD FUND&#13;
The road maintenance policy should be supported by revenues obtained from use of the&#13;
country's road network. Within this principle the Government is concerned to help strengthen the&#13;
capacity for collecting receipts from taxes levied directly on use of the country's road network,&#13;
almost all of which will be channeled to the Road Fund (RF).&#13;
With a view of improving efficiency of the Road Fund in collecting revenues form the road&#13;
vehicle tax, the MES proposes that the following set of measures be taken, which it is assumed&#13;
should be permanent:&#13;
*      Maintain the RF as an autonomous entity whose activity is merely financial.&#13;
*      Immediately implement all the measures identified under the PRI and approved by&#13;
the board of the RF and by the MES, for management procedures and internal&#13;
monitoring mechanisms.&#13;
*      Arrange accounting and management audits by firms internationally respected for&#13;
their auditing work; their selection shall be made by mutual agreement with IDA.&#13;
The frequency of the accounting audits will be at least annual; they shall be&#13;
completed by the end of March of the year following the year to be audited. The&#13;
management audits will be performed as deemed by IDA, with not regular&#13;
intervals defined.&#13;
-      Ensure that the Road Fund receives 75% of the revenues from licenses for&#13;
transportation of passengers and merchandise beginning July 1, 1995. At present&#13;
these revenues are earmarked in their entirely for the DNVT.&#13;
*      Updating the road vehicle and compensation taxes and fees for issuing licenses for&#13;
road passenger and freight transport in line with the rates in the table in this&#13;
document. The increases for the current year will take effect July 1, 1995.&#13;
*      Adjust the rates as well as compulsory application of the road and compensation&#13;
tax to all vehicles as of July 1, 1995, will be determined by joint order by the&#13;
Ministers of Social Equipment and Finance.&#13;
*      The Government shall promote any legislation needed for immediate&#13;
implementation of the measures identified in this document, as well as for meeting&#13;
the estimates of RF revenues shown in the following table.&#13;

TRANSPORT AND URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT&#13;
URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENT&#13;
WATER AND SANITATION SUB-COMPONENT&#13;
I.     Status of the Sector&#13;
A.    Water Supply&#13;
The urban water supply subsector in Guinea-Bissau is characterized by mediocre services&#13;
in a situation of strong urban growth, inadequate operating resources and marked dependence on&#13;
external financial aid. The weakness of the institutional and regulatory structure and in particular&#13;
the absence of state-management in the secondary centers is also a major constraint on the&#13;
subsector's development.&#13;
At Bissau, out of a total rural population of nearly 250,000, less than 25,000 people (only&#13;
10 percent of the population) have direct access to potable water by means of household&#13;
connections. Nearly 30,000 more people obtain their water from public standpipes, free of charge.&#13;
The great majority of the population (78 percent) obtain their water from traditional dub wells&#13;
which tap superficial water tables exposed to contamination from poorly designed latrines. The&#13;
city is supplied by nine tubewells which draw from the Maestrichtien deep water table, with an&#13;
estimated total daily output of 15,000 m3. The total storage capacity of 2,000 m3 (11 percent of&#13;
daily production) is far from adequate, having regard to the frequent stoppages noted at the&#13;
pumping centers. The distribution network consists in large part of small-diameter asbestos&#13;
cement pipes, and its obsolescent condition causes losses of the order of 50 percent. The network&#13;
is not correctly structured and in some areas the water pressure is very inadequate.&#13;
As at Bissau, the water supply situation in the secondary cities is precarious. Only eight&#13;
secondary cities possess networks--which are old and rudimentary--and only two of these meet the&#13;
minimum criteria for an acceptable public water supply service. At Gabu (Programa de A~cao&#13;
Social e de Infraestrutura-PASI) has carried out limited expansion projects: 1 tubewell, 2.5 km of&#13;
distribution piping, I 60m3 reservoir and 18 standpipes at Bafata, and 1.2 km of distribution&#13;
piping and 10 standpipes at Gabu. In all secondary cities, the water distribution systems are under&#13;
the responsibility of the local authorities. In the case of subscribers that have water and electricity&#13;
connections, water is paid for at a flat rate based on the amount of the electricity bill. For all&#13;
others it is free of charge, but distribution is limited to a few hours a day.&#13;
B.    Sanitation&#13;
The sanitation subsection is characterized by lack of the necessary resources for project&#13;
execution and a certain amount of confusion in the responsibilities of the various entities involved&#13;
(several ministries, affiliated projects, municipalities and private promoters).&#13;
Only the city center of Bissau possesses a sewage network--a rudimentary one dating from&#13;
the colonial era with an offshore raw sewage outfall. Although this network serves only the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59&#13;
Annex 8B&#13;
Page 2 of 9&#13;
hospital, a number of clandcstinc connections to it arc known. Operation and maintcnancc of this&#13;
nctwork arc the rcsponsibility of the municipality, which rcccivcs no rcmuneration for this scrvice.&#13;
Nearly all residents of Guinea-Bissau's urban centers possess individual sanitation systems: trench&#13;
latrines, ccsspits, and scptic tanks in the case of the better-off residents. Unfortunately, thesc&#13;
faeilities are generally poorly designed and do not comply with hygiene, health and environmental&#13;
protection requirements. The superficial water tables from which most urban dwellers obtain their&#13;
water, by means of wells, are contaminated, a situation that represents a public health danger.&#13;
Rainwater discharge also poses enormous problems in the urban areas owing to the&#13;
inadequacv of the resources available for operation and maintenance of the existing works, the&#13;
chaotic development of urban housing and the lack of coordination among the many entities&#13;
involved (public works agencies, housing agencies, municipalities, and private promoters). Other&#13;
technilcal constraints associated with heavy rainfall, sanding-up of the works and the defective&#13;
household garbage collection systcm (dumping of solid waste into open canals) also contribute to&#13;
the poor performance of the system. Evcry rainy season witnesses frequent floods which cause&#13;
scrious environmental damage (stagnant water, road erosion and gullying) and somctimes&#13;
substantial properly losses. Durable improvcment of the system calls for an ovcrall strategic study&#13;
aimed at controlling runoff throughiout the watcrshed areas.&#13;
The urban garbagc collcction systems are inefficicnt. With PASI financing, the&#13;
Municipality of Bissau concluded a contract with a private firm to pick up household trash, but&#13;
this pick-up service cxtended to only 50 percent of the population and was halted for lack of&#13;
durabic financing. The lack of grassroots involvement in the design and financing of the system&#13;
u*doubtcdly contributed to the failure of the operation. The Municipality, which posscsses only a&#13;
single tractor and 5 trailers, is currcntly financing a very sporadic and localized garbage pick-up&#13;
service provided by a private carrier.&#13;
The sector's devclopment is hampered by a number of constraints, including the following:&#13;
-      The people arc not involved in the planning, management and financing of the&#13;
urban services, which explains their lack of commitment to the comprehensive&#13;
resolution of the urban environmental problems.&#13;
-      Their low income levels limit the capacity of households to share financially in&#13;
urban services cost recovery.&#13;
-      The limited taxation possibilities.&#13;
-      The water and sanitation network arc obsolescent. Action to rehabilitate and&#13;
optimize their operation should therefore take priority over any expansion of the&#13;
scrvicc.&#13;
There arc ncvcrthelcss a number of factors favorable to the successful implementation of a&#13;
water and sanitation projcct:&#13;
-      A water supply and sanitation master plan exists on the basis of which the&#13;
Government of Buinea-Bissau has determined its priorities and clarified&#13;
institutional rcsponsibilitics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 8B&#13;
Page 3 of 9&#13;
The authorities have officially accepted the principle of private-sector&#13;
participation. Moreover, management of urban water and sanitation services has&#13;
improved, thanks in particular to the involvement of the private sector in the he&#13;
provision of water services and trash collections.&#13;
The principle of recovery of the cost of the services from the users is recognized&#13;
by the authorities and accepted by the users. It will, however, be implemented in&#13;
stages, having regard to the level of living of the people and to acquired habits.&#13;
H.    Background to the Operation&#13;
The World Bank is assisting the Government of Guinea-Bissau in preparing a Water&#13;
Supply and Sanitation Improvement Program in Bissau and the Secondary Centers with the&#13;
ollowing main components: (a) development of national skills and training; (b) improvement of&#13;
institutional management of the sector, and (c) widening urban water supply and sanitation service&#13;
coverage by dcveloping infrastructure tailored to user demand and local socioeconomic conditions.&#13;
The present operation comprises the Water and Sanitation component of the multisectoral&#13;
Transport and Urban Infrastructure Project. The proposed activities comprise emergency&#13;
measures designcd to alleviate the situation of urban residents pending implementation of the&#13;
program referred to in the following paragraph. They are aimed essentially at upgrading the urban&#13;
environment through rehabilitation of potable water distribution networks and urban drainage&#13;
works, together with a pilot household trash collection and disposal project. These actions will be&#13;
supported by a campaign to make the people aware of the role they need to play in improving their&#13;
living environment. In accordance with the guidelines of the multisector project, the works will be&#13;
executed using the AGEOPPE method, in close collaboration with the administrations concerned.&#13;
111.   Description of the Water and Sanitation Component.&#13;
A.    Program Identification Criteria&#13;
In light of the program setting, selection of the activities comprising the emergency water&#13;
and sanitation program was based on the following assessment criteria:&#13;
TThe proposed operations should not place constraints on the development strategy&#13;
options of the sector.&#13;
Priority will be given to simple operations of rehabilitation and operational&#13;
improvement of existing works that are easy to implement and/or for which a well-&#13;
defined institutional frarnework exists. They must also meet an urgent demand&#13;
expressed on the Guinea-Bissau side.&#13;
Use of the AGEOPPE method of execution requires that (I) so far as possible, the&#13;
operations are within the capacity of local enterprises, in terms of both the nature&#13;
of the works and the size of the execution lots; (ii) the works are carried out using&#13;
highly labor-intensive methods, in order to achieve wide income redistribution, and&#13;
(iii) the execution costs are acceptable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
61&#13;
Annex 8B&#13;
Page 4 of 9&#13;
The total cost of the emergency program (basic costs and contingencies) is limited&#13;
to US$5 million. The planning calls for implementation of the "water supply and&#13;
urban drainage" operations over two years and of the pilot "solid waste" project&#13;
over three years.&#13;
B.    Action Program&#13;
The program comprises activities in three categories: (I) upgrading of water supply; (ii)&#13;
upgrading of urban drainage, and (iii) a pilot solid waste collection and disposal project. The&#13;
proposed activities, cost estimates and investment program are detailed in the annexed tables.&#13;
Water Supply Subcomponent&#13;
This operation relates to the city of Bissau, which possess and acceptable management&#13;
framework for the sector but whose water supply situation continues to be cause for concern.&#13;
It comprises three types of activities, with a total cost of US$2.04 million:&#13;
(a)    Rehabilitation of existing network: (I) renovating obsolescent piping and&#13;
ancillary equipment in order to stem the substantial water losses through the network,&#13;
estimated at nearly 50 percent of total production volume, and (ii) remaking existing&#13;
reservoirs.&#13;
(b)    Network interconnection and redimensioning: Laying new 200-mm and 250-&#13;
mm PVC pipes over a total length of 10.4 km to upgrade the functioning and raise the&#13;
output of the Bissau water distribution network.&#13;
(c)    Strengthening of supply conduits: Upgrading supply flows and pressures in&#13;
certain neighborhoods by strengthening the piping (200- and 250-mm dia.) over a length of&#13;
4.5 km.&#13;
In the case of the secondary cities, the emergency program does not include any investment&#13;
in additional water production or network expansion works, owing first of all to the absence of a&#13;
suitable institutional framework, and secondly to the lack of precise data on the willingness of the&#13;
people to pay for a improved water supply service. These data will be available at the end of the&#13;
preparatory phase of the Bissau and Secondary Cities Water Supply and Sanitation Program,&#13;
which will include an important additional water production and network expansion component.&#13;
The execution studies for this operation are already included in the present project, for an amount&#13;
of US$275,000.&#13;
Urban Drainage Subcomponent&#13;
The proposed operations do not include drainage works associated with road construction,&#13;
which have been taken into account in the Roads sub-component. They will relate in priority to&#13;
outfall upgrading works. Provision is also included for rehabilitation of existing works and,&#13;
exceptionally, execution of new works in sensitive areas; the total cost of these interventions is&#13;
estimated at US$1.62 million (works, contingencies, studies and supervision). They are limited to&#13;
the city of Bissau, which is hardest hit by flooding. The arrangements for maintenance of the&#13;
works will be firmed up by the strategic drainage studies for Bissau and the secondary cities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
62&#13;
Annex 8B&#13;
Page 5 of 9&#13;
Solid Waste Subcomponent&#13;
An amount of US$430,000 has been assigned to this subcomponent for the execution of&#13;
pilot operations relating to markets and certain priority neighborhoods in Bissau.&#13;
The operations comprises: (I) assistance in setting up groups of unemployed young people&#13;
for precollection of trash at the Bandim market, which faces a serious health problem; (ii)&#13;
awareness-arousing of the people, in priority those living in the neighborhoods where the drainage&#13;
operations will be carried out, with a view to organizing precollection circuits and to progressive&#13;
sharing by households in cost recovery, and (iii) testing of an innovative method of participatory&#13;
household garbage management which has been successfully tried out in Brazil.&#13;
IV.   Institutional Organization of the Program&#13;
The works will be entrusted to AGEOPPE, as delegated project manager. The public&#13;
agencies concemed will nevertheless be closely associated in involved in the planning, detailed&#13;
studies and implementation of the program:&#13;
Water Supply subcomponent: the Ministry of Natural Resources and EAGB&#13;
(Guinea-Bissau Water and Sanitation).&#13;
Urban Drainage subcomponent: Ministry of Social Infrastructure.&#13;
Solid Waste subcomponent: Municipality of Bissau.&#13;
The arrangements for execution of the Water Supply program are as follows: (I) the final&#13;
technical dossiers and the terms of reference of the consultants will be prepared under the&#13;
supervision of AGEOPPE, with permanent control by EAGB (Project Owner); (ii) the dossiers will&#13;
be examined and approved by EAGB's technical staff; (iii) AGEOPPE will carry out overall&#13;
supplies procurement in light of EAGB's technical specifications; (iv) AGEOPPE will select the&#13;
works contractors in agreement with EAGB; (v) the works will be executed under the supervision&#13;
of the consultants, and (vi) EAGB will perform technical acceptance and take-over of the works.&#13;
In order to instill a greater sense of involvement in the residents of the beneficiary&#13;
neighborhoods, the contractors will be required to recruit their skilled and unskilled labor from&#13;
among these residents. These are well-known procedures and practices, widely used in highly&#13;
labor-intensive community works executed by public works execution agencies (earthworks, cut&#13;
and fill earth moving, and so on). This requirement applies to both the Water Supply and the&#13;
Urban Drainage subcomponents.&#13;

TRANSPORT AND URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL SET-UP OF AGEOPPE&#13;
Contract Management Agency&#13;
The institutional set-up of this project, in line with other AGETIP-type operations, is&#13;
reflected in a number of legal and contractual relationships among the various actors concemed:&#13;
the central government, local governments, the Executing Agency, contractors, and consulting&#13;
firms. The term "contractors" is used to include building and construction companies,&#13;
cooperatives, and other legally constituted entities able to enter into a contract for sub-project&#13;
execution. The term "consulting firm" refers principally to engineering and architectural firms, but&#13;
many eventually include other legally constituted entities (e.g., non-governmental organizations&#13;
(NGOs)) able to provide the services required. The legal texts setting forth the above-mentioned&#13;
contractual relationships are described below:&#13;
(a)    The implementation of the project is entrusted to an executing agency named&#13;
BISSAUWORKS, hereafter referred to as "the Agency". The Articles of&#13;
Agreement of the Agency, which must at all times be acceptable to IDA, provide&#13;
that the Agency is a non-profit association whose Board includes the Mayor of&#13;
Bissau, a representative of the Transportors' Association (ASTRA), a recognized&#13;
civil leader, and a representative of the Chamber of Commerce. The role of the&#13;
President of the Board also includes one physical person elected as Administrator&#13;
of the Agency, to whom is fully entrusted the day-to-day management of the&#13;
Agency. As provided by the Articles of Agreement of the Agency, the&#13;
Administrator may be replaced only by extraordinary decision of the Board. The&#13;
Administrator, however, must be at all times acceptable to IDA. The Agency will&#13;
be effectively created after the founding members of the Board hold their first&#13;
meeting to approve the Articles of Agreement.&#13;
(b)    The Subsidiary Agreement between the Government and the Agency describes the&#13;
latter's modus operandi in the context of the present project. Among other things,&#13;
the Agreement establishes: that the Agency will execute sub-projects consistent&#13;
with those defined in the project; that, in the beginning, these sub-projects will be&#13;
exclusively located in the city of Bissau and then later extended to up to five other&#13;
secondary centers; that the Government of Guinea-Bissau will place non-&#13;
reimbursable financial resources at the disposal of the Agency, including the&#13;
proceeds of the credit, in an Account; that the Agency can also receive resources&#13;
from others sources; that the Procedures Manual is an integral part of the&#13;
Framework Agreement; that the Administrator of the Agency has full powers in&#13;
connection with the management of the Agency; that the Administrator can be&#13;
replaced only in accordance with the Articles of Agreement of the Agency; that the&#13;
Government confers to the Agency all powers required for the implementation of&#13;
the project; that the Agency will execute all sub-projects in strict compliance with&#13;
the Procedures Manual; and that the By-laws of the Agency cannot be modified&#13;
without Govermnent's agreement.&#13;
&#13;

68                                  Annex 9&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
(c)    The By-laws of the Agency (Statutes) establish the internal organization; hiring,&#13;
firing and other personnel management procedures; and administrative rules and&#13;
regulations. They ensure, among other things, that the Agency will have a small&#13;
staff, including a an Administrator assisted by one Financial Director and one&#13;
Technical Director.&#13;
(d)    The Procedures Manual which must at all times be acceptable to IDA, recalls the&#13;
fundamental objectives of the Agency and establishes: the procedures whereby the&#13;
Agency receives and processes sub-project execution requests from beneficiaries&#13;
(central or local governments), including the model Execution Agreement it will&#13;
sign with the beneficiary if it decides to execute the sub-project; the procedures&#13;
used by the Agency to establish and continuously update a roster of contractors&#13;
for different types of sub-projects; the various procurement procedures to be used&#13;
by the Agency for sub-project execution (depending on the estimated value of the&#13;
contract), including Sample Bidding Documents with a model contract to be&#13;
signed with the contractor; the procurement procedures to be used by the Agency&#13;
for sub-project engineering and supervision, including a model contract to be&#13;
signed with consulting firms the accounting and disbursement procedures to be&#13;
used by the Agency in connection with each sub-project; the financial management&#13;
procedure to be used by the Agency; the nature and periodicity of reporting by the&#13;
Agency; the procedures to be followed to secure independent external auditing of&#13;
the Agency; and personnel management procedures&#13;

Note: Threshold selection corresponds to a desirable percentage coverage of contract&#13;
value: (around 55% for goods and 43% for works), which requires a reasonable&#13;
individual workload for the task manager, given the project design and the use of a&#13;
contract management entity. (Any lower threshold for goods would require additional&#13;
staff input, which would not be realistic or desirable.)&#13;

            Guinea-Bissau - Transport and Urban
            Infrastructure Project

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Transport and
            Urban Infrastructure Project are: 1) to improve the
            management of public sector resources devoted to economic
            and urban social infrastructure; 2) to rehabilitate
            transport and urban infrastructure; and 3) to efficiently
            execute works by private small- and medium-sized enterprises
            by delegating contract management to an AGETIP-type agency
            (public works executing agency). To achieve these
            objectives, the project will support development and
            implementation of a sector-specific policy framework and
            three investment components. The policy agenda is designed:
            a) to increase sector resource mobilization and efficiency
            of resource use; b) to futher strengthen the institutional
            environemnt and disengage the Government from public
            enterprises in the transport sector; c) to improve the
            management of road rehabilitation and maintenance; d) to
            promote the use of private sector; and e) to increase the
            efficiency and competitiveness of the contracting of works.
            The three investment components include: transport
            infrastructure rehabilitation, urban infrastructure
            rehabilitation, and capacity building programs.
