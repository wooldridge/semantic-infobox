            The Water and Sanitation Program's
            (WSP's) Global Scaling up Sanitation Project combines
            the approaches of Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS),
            behavior change communications, and social marketing to
            generate sanitation demand and strengthen the supply of
            sanitation products and services at large scale. Training
            has played an essential role to scale up rural sanitation in
            India, Indonesia, and Tanzania, where the project has been
            implemented to date. Two key learning's have emerged.
            First, training skills are essential at all levels
            (national, regional, and local) to implement an at-scale
            rural sanitation program; and second, a training program
            must focus at the local government level for implementation.
