ANNEX 1&#13;
COMPONENT 1:       FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES&#13;
The organisation maintains sound financial management systems and arrangements to&#13;
ensure that funds are used for the purposes intended with due attention to considerations of&#13;
economy and efficiency and value for money. The organisation's financial management&#13;
systems and arrangements (which include its budgeting, accounting, internal controls, funds&#13;
flow, financial reporting and internal and external auditing arrangements, and related policies,&#13;
procedures and practices): facilitate the preparation of regular, timely and reliable financial&#13;
statements; support the provision of a complete, true and fair record of all transactions and&#13;
balances, including those relating to funds to which this FPA applies; safeguard assets,&#13;
including assets financed by funds to which this FPA applies; and are subject to internal and&#13;
external auditing arrangements in line with internationally accepted standards.&#13;
The organisation's auditing arrangements allow, on an exceptional basis, for its&#13;
external auditors to be requested to perform a special examination.&#13;
The organisation continuously undertakes appropriate measures, including capacity&#13;
strengthening, to mitigate risks posed by any weakness identified in its financial management&#13;
systems and arrangements.&#13;
COMPONENT 2:       PROCUREMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES&#13;
The organisation's procurement policies and procedures: require procurement actions&#13;
to be taken on the basis of economy and efficiency, and value for money (with due&#13;
consideration towards promotion of sustainable and competitive markets); require&#13;
transparency to the maximum extent possible consistent with achieving all other goals of a&#13;
sound procurement system; and have appropriate procedures for all different types of&#13;
procurement (goods, works, consulting and non-consulting services etc.).&#13;
These procurement policies and procedures provide for a range of procurement&#13;
modalities including but not limited to open competitive bidding, invitation to bid issued to&#13;
pre-qualified suppliers selected by the organisation, and single sourcing. In the case of open&#13;
competitive bidding, the organisation's procurement policies and procedures provide for&#13;
timely and effective notification of bidding opportunities, use of bidding documents that&#13;
clearly identify all requirements and evaluation criteria, and award based on those criteria as&#13;
set forth in the bidding documents. The organisation may also have provisions for acceptance&#13;
of unsolicited approaches from potential suppliers to be pre-qualified.&#13;
The organisation's contract documents clearly define the contracting parties' rights&#13;
and obligations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿- 17 -&#13;
The organisation's procurement policies and procedures also provide for publication&#13;
of award of contract in appropriate cases.&#13;
The organisation's procurement policies and procedures ensure clear identification of&#13;
authority to take procurement actions and accountability for such actions. The organisation's&#13;
procurement policies and procedures and other applicable regulations, rules, and procedures,&#13;
provide appropriate processes and structures for monitoring and evaluation of procurement&#13;
actions and performance, and enable reporting of problems and complaints to officials with&#13;
authority to address such problems based on appropriate mechanisms and in a timely manner&#13;
and, where appropriate, provide for remedies.&#13;
The organisation's procurement policies and procedures do not prevent it from&#13;
determining, through disclosure by potential contractors or vendors, whether a party to which&#13;
it is considering issuing a contract is subject to any sanction or temporary suspension imposed&#13;
by any organisation within the United Nations System including the World Bank.&#13;
COMPONENT 3:       PROGRAMME OR PROJECT DESIGN OR PREPARATION, IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
AND MONITORING&#13;
Programme or Project Preparation and Implementation&#13;
The organisation's programmes or projects are based on the organisation's mandate;&#13;
are based on policies and procedures for programme and project design or preparation and&#13;
implementation that are transparent and publicly available; are developed through a process&#13;
that includes as appropriate participation by and consultation with relevant stakeholders&#13;
including member government counterparts and others; are designed to avoid, mitigate, or&#13;
minimize adverse environmental and social impacts; are based on a results-based approach or&#13;
a similar conceptual approach; are focused on results; have objectives, indicators of&#13;
achievement and assumptions that are clearly stated; have performance measures based on&#13;
objectives that are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-bound; include a&#13;
monitoring and evaluation plan; and are subject to review and approval prior to&#13;
implementation.&#13;
Reporting Arrangements&#13;
The organisation's programme or project reporting requirements include a narrative&#13;
progress report as well as a financial progress report, including financial statements, covering&#13;
the whole programme or project. The narrative progress report is required to include: a&#13;
summary of the programme or project and the context within which the programme or project&#13;
is implemented; the activities actually carried out during the reporting period; any challenges&#13;
encountered and measures taken to overcome challenges; changes introduced in&#13;
implementation, including changes in the budget; achievements and results of the programme&#13;
or project with reference to identified indicators; and the work plan for the following period.&#13;
The organisation requires such reports as frequently as is necessary to ensure the reports are&#13;
useful management tools and to provide meaningful reports and assessments of progress,&#13;
achievements, and challenges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿- 18-&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements&#13;
The organisation's programme and project monitoring arrangements are designed to&#13;
ensure frequent monitoring of the implementation of its programmes or projects to test for on-&#13;
going progress and the achievement of outcomes as planned. The organisation's evaluation&#13;
function (or its equivalent), while appointed by management, operates without interference or&#13;
instruction by management and has access as it deems necessary to the member countries or&#13;
shareholders.  The organisation's evaluation function uses the appropriate evaluation&#13;
methodology for the programme or project being evaluated, and options may include desk&#13;
evaluations, in-depth evaluations, and evaluations conducted mid-term, terminal or ex-post.&#13;
COMPONENT 4:       ADDRESSING FRAUD AND CORRUPTION&#13;
The organisation's officials are: subject to staff regulations, rules, procedures and&#13;
administrative instructions that prohibit unethical conduct, fraud, and corruption; required,&#13;
above an appropriate level of seniority and responsibility, to provide disclosure of financial&#13;
interests so as to mitigate significantly the risk to the financial assets under the organisation's&#13;
control; expected to conduct themselves in accordance with the organisation's code of&#13;
conduct.&#13;
The organisation's regulations, rules, procedures and administrative practices provide&#13;
for reasonable measures, consistent with its rules, procedures and administrative practices, to&#13;
prevent and address any information that indicates the need for further scrutiny (including&#13;
corrupt, fraudulent, coercive or collusive practices) in connection with its activities and&#13;
operations.&#13;
The organisation has established mechanisms for significantly mitigating the risk of&#13;
fraud and corruption in its activities and operations including a "hotline" to receive allegations&#13;
of fraud or corruption; protection for whistleblowers against retaliation; and an internal&#13;
investigations function that, while appointed by and reporting to management, operates&#13;
without interference or instruction by management.&#13;
The organisation has appropriate mechanisms in place to exclude firms or individuals&#13;
determined by it to have engaged in fraudulent or corrupt activities from participation in&#13;
contracts with such organisation, whether indefinitely or for a specified duration; and is not&#13;
prevented from giving due regard to similar decisions by other international organisations,&#13;
including organisations that are signatories to this FPA.&#13;

[CO - country]&#13;
Re:   [grant name and number]&#13;
Dear[ ]:&#13;
I am writing on behalf of the [International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]&#13;
[and] [International Development Association] (the "World Bank" or the "Disbursing&#13;
Oraanization"), as administrator of the [Multi-Donor] Trust Fund for [name of trust fund] (the&#13;
"Trust Fund") to indicate the Disbursing Organization's agreement to make a grant in an amount not&#13;
exceeding [amount in words] United States Dollars (US$ [amount in figures]) (the "Grant") to&#13;
[name of UN Organization] (the "Receiving Organization") for the benefit of [name of country] (the&#13;
"Beneficiar").&#13;
The Grant is made in accordance with instructions from the [name of goveming&#13;
mechanism] (the "Trust Fund Steering Committee"), which has authority to determine the allocation&#13;
of funds in connection with the Trust Fund by virtue of an administration agreement and/or&#13;
resolution(s) for the establishment of the Trust Fund. The Grant is made for the purposes and on the&#13;
terms and conditions set forth in the annexes to this Agreement.&#13;
The Receiving Organization represents, by confirming its agreement below, that it is&#13;
authorised to contract and withdraw the Grant for the said purposes and on the said terms and&#13;
conditions, and the Receiving Organization makes this representation knowing that Disbursing&#13;
Organization will rely on it for purposes of disbursing the Grant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿- 20 -&#13;
In light of the fact that both the Disbursing Organization and the Receiving Organization are&#13;
signatories to the Fiduciary Principles Accord dated as of [ ] (the "FPA"), the funds transferred&#13;
under this Grant will be received, administered, managed, expended, reported on, and audited,&#13;
exclusively in accordance with the regulations, rules, procedures and administrative practices of the&#13;
Receiving Organization, including those relating to its environmental, social and resettlement&#13;
policies as well as those relating to direct and indirect costs (including indirect programme support&#13;
costs) and interest, and will be subject to the terms of this Agreement. In this regard, it is understood&#13;
that indirect costs of the Receiving Organizations recovered through programme support costs&#13;
will be 7% and that in accordance with the UN General Assembly resolution 62/208 (2007&#13;
Triennial Comprehensive Policy Review principle of full cost recovery), all other costs&#13;
incurred by such Receiving Organization in carrying out the Activities under this Grant will&#13;
be recovered as direct costs. It is also understood that the Financial Management Framework&#13;
Agreement between the United Nations and the World Bank dated March 10, 2006, does not apply&#13;
to the Grant.&#13;
Please note that, in accordance with the Disbursing Organization's policy on disclosure of&#13;
information, the Disbursing Organization will make this Agreement publicly available after this&#13;
Agreement has become effective and the Receiving Organization, by countersigning this&#13;
Agreement, gives its consent to such disclosure, it being understood, however, that the Disbursing&#13;
Organization will consult with the Receiving Organization regarding whether to disclose any&#13;
information in Annex B to this Agreement that the Receiving Organization regards as sensitive.&#13;
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing, on behalf of the Receiving Organization,&#13;
by signing, dating, and returning to us the enclosed copy of this Agreement. Upon receipt by the&#13;
Disbursing Organization of the copy of this Agreement countersigned by you this Agreement will&#13;
become effective as of the date of the countersignature.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-23 -&#13;
3.4   In the event that either the Receiving Organization or the Disbursing Organization becomes&#13;
aware of factors that would indicate that corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices were&#13;

award process or contract implementation, the provisions of Section 7 of this Annex A will apply.&#13;
3.5   Unless self-insured, the Receiving Organization shall ensure that all imported goods to be&#13;

and materials financed out of the proceeds of the Grant in accordance with the provisions of the&#13;
relevant provisions of the basic agreement between the Receiving Organization and the Beneficiary&#13;
that governs the treatment of such equipment and materials or, if there is no relevant provisions, in&#13;
accordance with the Receiving Organization's policies and usual practices and procedures and shall&#13;
so advise the Beneficiary.&#13;
4.    Withdrawal of Grant Proceeds&#13;
4.1    Subject to the availability of funds in the Trust Fund, the Disbursing Organization will credit&#13;
the proceeds of the Grant to an account opened by the Disbursing Organization on its books in the&#13;
name of the Receiving Organization (the "Grant Account"), in line with the Project Budget set forth&#13;
in Annex B, and as may be amended from time to time by the Trust Fund Steering Committee. The&#13;
proceeds of the Grant may be withdrawn from the Grant Account by the Receiving Organization in&#13;

4.2   The Receiving Organization will make withdrawals from the Grant Account by delivering&#13;
to the Disbursing Organization a written notice of withdrawal, in line with the attached Annex B,&#13;
and the Disbursing Organization will be entitled to rely upon such instructions. The notice of&#13;
withdrawal must be signed on behalf of the Receiving Organization by official(s) designated by the&#13;
ReceiVing Organization to sign such notices. The amounts set out in each notice of withdrawal will&#13;
be disbursed to the bank account set out in section 4.3(b) of this Annex A unless the Disbursing&#13;
Organization is otherwise notified in writing by the Receiving Organization.&#13;
4.3   (a) . The Receiving Organization's first notice of withdrawal will cover projected&#13;
expenditures for the Activities for the first nine (9) months of implementation, The&#13;
Receiving Organization will deliver to the Disbursing Organization subsequent notices of&#13;
withdrawal each six (6) months thereafter, and each such notice will cover an amount&#13;
representing the Recipient's good faith projection of the expenditures for the Activities for&#13;
the following nine (9) months, reconciling against amounts previously withdrawn and&#13;
against the Project Budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿- 24 -&#13;
(b)    The Disbursing Organization will disburse to the Receiving Organization the full&#13;
amount requested in each notice of withdrawal and will do so (i) by wire transfer in the&#13;
currency of the Grant; (ii) within five (5) working days of receiving a notice of withdrawal;&#13;
and (iii) to the following bank account or such other bank account as the Receiving&#13;
Organization may nominate and notify in writing to the Disbursing Organization.&#13;
[      I&#13;
When making such disbursements the Disbursing Organization will notify the Receiving&#13;
Organization's chief financial manager, by fax ([fax #]) or by e-mail ([email details]), of the&#13;
following: (i) the amount transferred; (ii) the value date of the transfer; (iii) that the transfer&#13;
is from the Disbursing Organization's Grant Account for [grant name and number]; and (iv)&#13;

recovery"), all other costs incurred by such Participating Organization in carrying out the&#13;
activities for which it is responsible under the Fund will be recovered as direct costs.&#13;
Section III&#13;
Activities of the Participating Organizations&#13;
1.    The implementation of programme activities approved by the Steering Committee and&#13;
funded from the Fund will be the responsibility of the Participating Organizations and will be&#13;
carried out by each Participating Organization in accordance with its applicable regulations,&#13;
rules, directives and procedures. The Participating Organizations will be responsible only for&#13;
performing those functions specifically set forth in this Memorandum of Understanding and&#13;
the relevant programmatic document, and will not be subject to any other duties or&#13;
responsibilities to the donor or to the Administrative Agent, except for such tasks as may be&#13;
accepted by a Participating Organization pursuant to the provisions of Section I, paragraph 3&#13;
of this Memorandum   of Understanding.  On the termination or expiration of this&#13;
Memorandum of Understanding, the matter of ownership of supplies and equipment will be&#13;
determined in accordance with the regulations, rules, directives and procedures applicable to&#13;
such Participating Organizations, including, where applicable, any agreement with the&#13;
relevant host Government (if applicable).&#13;
2.    Any modifications to scope of the approved programmatic document, including as to&#13;
the nature, content, sequencing or the duration of programme activities, will be subject to&#13;
mutual agreement in writing between the relevant Participating Organization and the Steering&#13;
Committee, and reflected in a revised programmatic document. If there is a need to change&#13;
the approved programmatic document, the Participating Organization will promptly notify the&#13;
Steering Committee and seek its approval. Once approved, the Steering Committee will&#13;
inform the Administrative Agent of any change in the budget as set out in the approved&#13;
programmatic document.&#13;
3.    Where a Participating Organization wishes to carry out its approved programme&#13;
activities through or in collaboration with a third party, it will be responsible for discharging&#13;
all commitments and obligations with such third parties, and no other Participating&#13;
Organization, nor the Administrative Agent, will be responsible for doing so.&#13;
4.    In carrying out the approved programme activities, none of the Participating&#13;
Organizations will be considered as an agent of any of the others and, thus, the personnel of&#13;
one will not be considered as staff members, personnel or agents of any of the others. Without&#13;
restricting the generality of the preceding sentence, none of the Participating Organizations&#13;
will be liable for the acts or omissions of the other Participating Organizations or their&#13;
personnel, or of persons performing services on their behalf.&#13;
5.    Each Participating Organization will advise the Administrative Agent in writing when&#13;
all activities for which it is responsible under the approved programmatic document have been&#13;
completed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-37-&#13;
6.    (a)   The Participating Organizations recognize that under the Administrative&#13;
Arrangement the donors contributing to the Fund reserve the right to discontinue future&#13;
contributions if reporting obligations are not met as set forth in the Administrative&#13;
Arrangement or if there are substantial deviations from agreed plans and budgets not&#13;
approved by the Steering Committee. If it is agreed among donors(s), the Administrative&#13;
Agent and a particular Participating Organization that there is evidence of improper use of&#13;
funds by that Participating Organization, that Participating Organization will use its best&#13;
efforts, consistent with its regulations, rules, policies and procedures to recover any funds&#13;
misused. That Participating Organization will, in consultation with the Steering Committee&#13;
and the Administrative Agent, credit any funds so recovered to the Fund or agree with the&#13;
Steering Committee to use these funds for a purpose mutually agreed upon. In accordance&#13;
with the Administrative Arrangement, before withholding future contributions or requesting&#13;
recovery of funds and credit to the Fund Account, the donors will consult with the concerned&#13;
Participating Organization and the Administrative Agent with a view to promptly resolving&#13;
the matter.&#13;
(b)   The provisions of Section Ill, paragraph 6(a) above do not apply to the World Bank.&#13;
In the case of the World Bank, when World Bank management determines that in the&#13;
expenditure of the monies received from the Fund Account there has been a substantive&#13;
departure from the purpose for which the monies were received, and that this departure falls&#13;
within the World Bank's exercise of its responsibilities, the World Bank will reimburse the&#13;
Fund Account for the expenditure covered by that substantive departure.&#13;
7.    The Participating Organizations recognize that it is important to take all necessary&#13;
precautions to avoid corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices. To this end, each&#13;
Participating Organization will maintain standards of conduct that govern the performance of&#13;
their staff, including the prohibition of corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices in&#13;
connection with the award and administration of contracts, grants, or other benefits, as set&#13;
forth in their Staff Regulations and Rules and Financial Regulations and Rules, including&#13;
regarding procurement. In the event that a Participating Organization determines that an&#13;
allegation in relation to the implementation of activities - including that corrupt, fraudulent,&#13;
collusive or coercive practices may have taken place related to the Fund -- is credible enough&#13;
to warrant an investigation, it will promptly notify the Steering Committee and the&#13;
Administrative Agent, to the extent that such notification does not jeopardize the conduct of&#13;
the investigation. The allegation will be dealt with in accordance with the Participating&#13;
Organization's accountability and oversight framework and by the Participating&#13;
Organization's unit in charge of investigations. Upon completion of the investigation, the&#13;
Participating Organization will inform the Steering Committee and the Administrative Agent&#13;
about the results of the investigation to the extent consistent with the Participating&#13;
Organization's policies, rules and procedures.&#13;
8.    As an exceptional measure, particularly during the start up phase of the Fund, subject&#13;
to conformity with their financial regulations, rules and directives, Participating Organizations&#13;
may elect to start implementation of programme activities in advance of receipt of initial or&#13;
subsequent transfers from the Fund Account by using their own resources. Such advance&#13;
activities will be undertaken in agreement with the Steering Committee on the basis of funds&#13;
it has allocated or approved for implementation by the particular Participating Organization&#13;
following receipt by the Administrative Agent of an official commitment form or signature of&#13;
the Administrative Arrangements by donors contributing to the Fund.  Participating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-38-&#13;
Organizations will be solely responsible for decisions to initiate such advance activities or&#13;
other activities outside the parameters set forth above.&#13;
Section IV&#13;

accordance with the provisions contained in the Fund TORs, which are consistent with the&#13;

fiscal year, the World Bank will provide to the Administrative Agent a management assertion&#13;
together with an attestation from the World Bank's auditors concerning the adequacy of&#13;
internal control over cash-based financial reporting for trust funds as a whole. The cost of&#13;
such attestation will be borne by the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
