ï»¿ANNEX 2&#13;
Standard Provisions&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration&#13;
Agreements between the Bank and the respective Donors.&#13;
1.  Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1     The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth&#13;
in this Administration Agreement and will not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to&#13;
the Donors, including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to&#13;
a fiduciary or trustee under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this&#13;
Administration Agreement will be considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank&#13;
under its Articles of Agreement or any applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2     Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") will be administered in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from&#13;
time to time, including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard&#13;
policies, its framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures&#13;
to prevent the use of Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations&#13;
to give effect to the relevant decisions of the Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the&#13;
Charter of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this provision does not create any&#13;
obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules&#13;
and executive orders of an individual member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2. Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1     The funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be accounted for as a single trust fund and&#13;
shall be kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund&#13;
may be commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity&#13;
as trustee, has legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2     The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund will be held is United States dollars&#13;
(the "Holding Currency").&#13;
2.3      Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their&#13;
respective Administration Arrangements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution&#13;
Currency other than the Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the&#13;
accompanying Deposit Instructions, the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding&#13;
Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion. Where deposits&#13;
prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a result of exchange rate fluctuations, neither the&#13;
Bank nor the Donor shall bear any responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;
2.4     The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other&#13;
currencies as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the&#13;
date of the conversion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿2.5     The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their&#13;
disbursement in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment&#13;
of trust funds administered by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from such investment to&#13;
the Trust Fund to be used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
3. Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
3.1     The Bank shall deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each&#13;
Installment, an amount equal to two percent (2%) per Installment as an administrative fee for the&#13;
Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2    In addition, costs incurred by the Bank for other expenses, such as for program&#13;
management and Trust Fund administration, that are (i) not covered by the percentage deduction&#13;
specified above as an administrative fee and (ii) not included under Annex 1 of the Administration&#13;
Agreements in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures will be charged to&#13;
the Trust Fund on an actual basis up to a maximum of five percent (5%) of the total Contributions&#13;
under all Administration Agreements.&#13;
3.3     Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust&#13;
Fund Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual&#13;
Contributions significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of&#13;
the first Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs&#13;
change, the Bank reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and&#13;
Costs section, which would be effectuated by amendments made to the Administration Agreements&#13;
of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable to all new Contributions that are provided&#13;
either as amendments to supplement existing Administration Agreements or from new Donors&#13;
under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
4.      Accounting and Financial Reporting&#13;
4.1     The Bank shall maintain separate records and ledger accounts in respect of the funds&#13;
deposited in the Trust Fund and disbursements made therefrom.&#13;
4.2     The Bank shall furnish to the Donors current financial information relating to receipts,&#13;
disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions via the&#13;
World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website. Within six (6) months after all&#13;
commitments and liabilities under the Trust Fund have been satisfied and the Trust Fund has been&#13;
closed, the final financial information relating to receipts, disbursements and fund balance in the&#13;
Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions shall be made available to the Donors via the&#13;
World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website.&#13;
4.3     The Bank shall provide to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Fund Donor Center&#13;
secure website, within six (6) months following the end of each Bank fiscal year, an annual single&#13;
audit report, comprising (i) a management assertion together with an attestation from the Bank's&#13;
external auditors concerning the adequacy of internal control over cash-based financial reporting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿for all cash-based trust funds as a whole; and (ii) a combined financial statement for all cash-based&#13;
trust funds together with the Bank's external auditor's opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit&#13;
shall be borne by the Bank.&#13;
4.4     If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the&#13;
Bank's external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank will first consult as to whether&#13;
such an external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope&#13;
and terms of reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference,&#13;
the Bank shall arrange for such external audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal&#13;
costs of the Bank with respect to such audit, shall be borne by the requesting Donor.&#13;
4.5     The Bank shall make available to the Donors copies of all financial statements and&#13;
auditors' reports received by the Bank from Recipients pursuant to any Grant Agreements (as&#13;
defined below) in accordance with the Bank's Access to Information Policy.&#13;
5.      Proaress Reporting&#13;
5.1     The Bank shall provide the Donors with annual reports on the progress of activities&#13;
financed by the Contributions. Within six (6) months of the End Disbursement Date (as defined&#13;
below), the Bank will furnish to the Donors a final report on the activities financed by the Trust&#13;
Fund.&#13;
5.2      Any Donor may review or evaluate activities financed by the Trust Fund at any time up&#13;
to six (6) months following the End Disbursement Date. The Donor and the Bank shall agree on&#13;
the scope and conduct of such review or evaluation, and the Bank shall provide all relevant&#13;
information within the limits of the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs,&#13;
including any costs incurred by the Bank, shall be borne by the Donor. It is understood that any&#13;
such review or evaluation will not constitute a financial, compliance or other audit of the Trust&#13;
Fund.&#13;
6.       Disbursement; Cancellation; Refund&#13;
6.1     It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be fully disbursed by the&#13;
Bank by December 31, 2020 (the "End Disbursement Date"). The Bank will only disburse funds&#13;
deposited in the Trust Fund for the purposes of this Administration Agreement (other than returns&#13;
to Donors) after such date to the extent such date is changed in accordance with amendments made&#13;
to the Administration Agreements of all the Donors. Following the End Disbursement Date, the&#13;
Bank shall return any remaining balance of the Trust Fund to each Donor in the Holding Currency&#13;
in the manner specified in its respective Administration Agreement on a pro rata basis with regard&#13;
to the total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by such Donor relative to the total funds deposited&#13;
in the Trust Fund by all Donors, all calculated as Holding Currency amounts.&#13;
6.2     Any Donor may cancel all or part of such Donor's pro rata share, and the Bank may&#13;
cancel all or any Donors' pro rata shares, upon three (3) months' prior written notice, of any&#13;
Contributions (paid and not yet paid) that are not committed pursuant to any agreements entered&#13;
into between the Bank and any consultants and/or other third parties for the purposes of this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Administration Agreement, including any Grant Agreements, prior to the receipt of such notice.&#13;
In the event of a cancellation, the Bank shall return to the Donor its pro-rata share in the Holding&#13;
Currency as specified in the Administration Agreement; unless otherwise agreed between the Bank&#13;
and the Donor.&#13;
7.      Disclosure; Dispute Resolution&#13;
7.1     The Bank shall disclose the Administration Agreements and related information on this&#13;
Trust Fund in accordance with the Bank's Policy on Access to Information. By entering into&#13;
Administration Agreements, the Donors consent to such disclosure of their respective&#13;
Administration Agreements and such related information.&#13;
7.2     The Donors and the Bank shall use their best efforts to amicably settle any dispute,&#13;
controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to the Administration Agreements.&#13;
8.      Grants to Recipients&#13;

one or more grant agreements (the "Grant Agreements") with recipients (the "Recipients")&#13;
consistent with the purposes of this Administration Agreement and on the terms and conditions set&#13;
forth in the Grant Agreements. Grant Agreements may be entered into up to the maximum amount&#13;
of the Contributions that all Donors have agreed to make available under the Administration&#13;
Agreements between the Bank and the Donors.&#13;
8.2     The Bank shall be responsible for the supervision of the activities financed under any&#13;
Grant Agreements. Subject to the consent of any relevant Recipients, representatives of the Donors&#13;
may be invited by the Bank to participate in Bank supervision missions related to the Trust Fund.&#13;
8.3     The Bank shall promptly inform the Donors of any significant modification to the terms&#13;
of any Grant Agreements and of any contractual remedies that are exercised by the Bank under&#13;
any Grant Agreements. To the extent practicable, the Bank shall afford the Donors the opportunity&#13;
to exchange views before effecting any such modification or exercising any such remedy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿ANNEX 3&#13;
Governance&#13;
This Annex will be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration&#13;
Arrangements between the Bank and the respective Donors.&#13;
A Steering Committee, consisting of representatives from the Bank and each Donor, will&#13;
be established to:&#13;
(a) provide strategic guidance on the implementation of the Trust Fund objective; (b) provide&#13;
inputs to the annual work program; and (c) discuss progress on the implementation of activities&#13;
funded by the Trust Fund.&#13;
The Steering Committee will meet at least annually, and the meetings will be chaired by&#13;
the Bank; decisions will be made by consensus. For purposes of knowledge sharing and&#13;
coordination, the Steering Committee may invite partner countries and/or institutions (such as the&#13;
World Health Organization (WHO) or the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC)/United&#13;
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)) to participate in its meetings as observers.&#13;
The Bank will be responsible for making decisions with respect to the allocation of funds,&#13;
the implementation of Bank-executed activities, including the development of work programs, and&#13;
the supervision of Recipient-executed activities.&#13;
