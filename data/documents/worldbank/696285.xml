TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Country Overview&#13;
1.1   Social and Economic Setting. Haiti is a small, predominately rural, country.&#13;
Its 7 million people occupy 28,000 square kilometers on the western end of the island of&#13;
Hispaniola. With an estimated GNP per capita of below US$250 in 1994, Haiti is the&#13;
poorest and one of the most densely populated nations in the Western Hemisphere. Social&#13;
indicators are alarming. In 1994, an estimated 50 percent of the population had a caloric&#13;
intake of below 75 percent of requirements, and over 25 percent of children suffered from&#13;
malnutrition. The infant mortality rate is estimated to exceed 100 per 1,000 live births.&#13;
Some 50 percent of adult Haitians are illiterate. Net of emigration of 0.5 percent, the&#13;
population grew at a rate of 1.8 percent per year in the 1980s. Unemployment and under&#13;
employment are estimated at 70 percent.&#13;
1.2   During 1980-91, Haiti's population suffered a continuing decline in its standard of&#13;
living, with real GNP per capita falling by about 2 percent per year. Over decades,&#13;
population pressure and poor public policies forced cultivation of increasingly marginal&#13;
lands, and in turn accelerated deforestation and soil erosion. As a result, agricultural&#13;
production, the main source of income of the 70 percent of the population who live in&#13;
rural areas, has fallen steadily on a per capita basis since the 1970s. In the second half of&#13;
the 1970s, an expansion in the export industry together with increasing public investment&#13;
partially compensated for the decline in agriculture and allowed the country to grow at a&#13;
rate of about 3 percent per capita. However, political instability during most of the 1980s&#13;
put a stop to industrial expansion, investment, external assistance and economic growth.&#13;
1.3   Political stalemate during the 1991-1994 period coupled with the international&#13;
embargo on Haiti aggravated economic decline. In 1990, President Aristide was&#13;
democratically elected and took office in February 1991. His Government undertook&#13;
measures to improve fiscal revenues, liberalize trade and improve infrastructure services,&#13;
and initiated discussions on an IMF stand-by agreement. However, in September 1991, a&#13;
military-led coup d'etat forced President Aristide from office and into exile. During the&#13;
following three years, increased economic mismanagement and international rejection led&#13;
to an international embargo, resulting in a dramatic decline in living standards. On&#13;
October 16, 1994, President Aristide was able to return to Haiti, and on November 7,&#13;
1994, a new constitutional Government was appointed. During this period, economic&#13;
performance deteriorated at an accelerated pace. Preliminary data indicate that real GDP&#13;
fell by over 17 percent during 1992-93, and by a further 10 percent in 1994. All sectors&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
were affected, and the situation was further aggravated by the tropical storm Gordon&#13;
which hit Haiti on November 12, 1994. Agricultural production and exports decreased&#13;
considerably. Export oriented industries were devastated by the embargo. Value-added in&#13;
the services sector decreased in line with GDP, and construction activities came to a&#13;
virtual standstill. After peaceful elections in December 1995, Rene Preval, Prime Minister&#13;
under Aristide's first Government in 1991, was elected and took office on February 7,&#13;
1996.&#13;
1.4    Forestry and Environmental Protection. Despite its small relative size, Haiti&#13;
has an unusually broad diversity of ecosystems and endemic species. Ecosystems include&#13;
alkaline, inland lakes, coastal mangrove forests, dry-scrub forests, savannas, and moist&#13;
forests on peaks reaching almost 3,000 meters. About 30 percent of Haiti's plant and&#13;
animal species are endemic to the island of Hispaniola: a greater percentage than is found&#13;
in the larger and less environmentally degraded Dominican Republic. This biological&#13;
richness is due to the wide range of rainfall and topography, and the fact that Haiti is a&#13;
combination of two geologically distinct islands, one supporting a biology with origins in&#13;
the North-American continent, and the other, the South American continent. The recently&#13;
published, Global Environmental Facility (GEF) sponsored study, A Conservation&#13;
Assessment of the Terrestrial Ecoregions of Latin America and the Caribbean, found that&#13;
both the moist forest and pine forest ecosystems of Hispaniola were regionally&#13;
outstanding.&#13;
1.5    Haiti's endowment of forest resources has been treated as a free good and&#13;
exploited to capitalize economic development since colonial times. Europeans cleared&#13;
mountain forests to establish coffee plantations and used clean-tilling agricultural practices&#13;
that promoted soil erosion. European colonists and, then later, early Haitian governments&#13;
harvested and exported timber (chiefly mahogany, ironwood, and logwood) to earn hard&#13;
currency. Haiti's peasants, especially the land-less and land-poor, have historically cleared&#13;
forest to expand agriculture and harvested trees to market timber and charcoal. Peasants&#13;
also exploit forest stocks in times of economic insecurity to finance unexpected&#13;
contingencies. In many situations, the unsustainable exploitation of trees or forest is the&#13;
only remaining income-generating option available to peasants.&#13;
1.6    The pace of degradation of forest resources accelerated rapidly over the last&#13;
several decades and Haiti's once abundant forests have diminished to a remnant.' Closed&#13;
BDPA-SCETAGRI (Gestion des Ressources Naturelles en Vue d 'un Developpement Durable en Haiti,&#13;
Rapport Final, Fevrier, 1990). Data on Haiti's wood resources is conflicting and not up-to-date. The&#13;
most recent inventory was made in 1978 by FAO and estimated the natural forest area at about&#13;
1,210 kMn2, down from the 1956 inventory result of 1,900 kin2, a reduction by 36 percent over 20 years.&#13;
The 1988 FAO/CP project preparation mission estimated natural forest cover at 1,070 km2 of natural&#13;
forest, a decrease of another 22 percent over ten years, broken down as follows:&#13;
Pine Forest:           Dense             80 km2&#13;
Degraded        200 km2&#13;
Leaf Forest:           Dense            140 km2&#13;
Degraded        500 km2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
cover, natural forest is now estimated to represent only 2 percent of all land area.&#13;
Twenty-five of the 30 major watersheds are almost devoid of cover. Forests are now&#13;
reduced to small and isolated patches and associated with steep ravines, high mountain&#13;
peaks and coastal mangrove areas. As a result, associated plant and animal species are&#13;
severely reduced in number and many species face extinction. This degradation is driven&#13;
by the forces mentioned above, only exacerbated by increases in population and rural&#13;
poverty. In addition to on-site biological damage, deforestation contributes to soil erosion&#13;
which in turn endangers water supplies and contributes to soil erosion. This erosion&#13;
decreases agricultural productivity, which is already half of the Latin American average.&#13;
At the same time, sedimentation affects hydro-energy supply, blocks drainage systems,&#13;
impedes use of port facilities and destroys marine ecosystems near the shore.&#13;
Environmental degradation is undercutting the productivity of the over 70 percent of&#13;
Haitians who reside in rural areas, and threatens to undermine all future national economic&#13;
development. The GEF sponsored study mentioned above, that classified Hispaniola's&#13;
moist and pine forest habitats regionally outstanding, concluded that these habitats were&#13;
endangered and in the highest category of priority for protection at the regional level.&#13;
1.7    Although Haiti has an impressive number of laws and regulations to protect natural&#13;
resources, these are largely either inappropriate, inconsistent or incomplete, and the&#13;
Government lacks the capacity to enforce them. The existing natural resource legislation&#13;
is poorly adapted to the socio-economic context of rural Haiti, emphasizing prohibition&#13;
with little attention to incentives. The historic situation of inappropriate regulations,&#13;
incapable enforcement and an unformed public establish a situation where incentives are&#13;
perverse, the potential for extortion high, and distortions are almost certainly pervasive.&#13;
For example, tree harvesting, even on private land, is officially prohibited except by permit&#13;
from the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development (MARNDR),&#13;
thereby creating a disincentive for farmers to adopt forestry practices. Although&#13;
according to MARNDR officials this particular policy is not currently enforced,&#13;
national-level officials do not have the means to know whether field agents are continuing&#13;
to demand payment.&#13;
1.8    A majority of the remaining contiguous, closed-cover forest in Haiti is located in&#13;
and around three national reserves -- the Pine Forest National Reserve, the Pic Macaya&#13;
National Park, and the La Visite National Park. Fortunately, these three areas encompass&#13;
the habitats of a great number of threatened and endangered endemic animal and plant&#13;
species. For example, some 80 percent of remaining Haitian bird species are represented&#13;
in the La Visite National Park. In addition, these areas are located at the headwaters of&#13;
Mangroves:            Degraded         150 km2&#13;
In addition to those areas of "natural forest," BDPA-SCETAGRI estirated: (a) 400 km 2 of very open&#13;
pine forest; (b) 800 krm2 of secondary broad leaf forest; (c) 2.900 km2 of degraded dryland forest (e.g.,&#13;
Prosopis and Acacia sps.); (d) 1,700 km2 of dense tree crops (e.g.. coffee); and (e) 4,000 km2 of open&#13;
tree crops. The final environmental report by BDPA of Februaiy 1990 does not give a detailed account&#13;
of Haiti's forest areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
several of Haiti's most productive agricultural areas and the aquifer from which&#13;
Port-au-Prince draws the majority of its potable water. Unfortunately, these reserves face&#13;
steady encroachment for agricultural production and illegal harvesting, and have recently&#13;
become a new target for commercial charcoal harvesters for the urban market. Local&#13;
peoples generally harvest for fuelwood and kindling, while the bulk of illegal logging and&#13;
sawmilling is organized by urban-based outsiders. Government protection of the reserves&#13;
has been, and remains, limited and all reserves are inadequately identified and delimited.&#13;
Governments have never supplied development services to local populations and few&#13;
NGOs have provided services in these high elevation areas. Local forest vigilance&#13;
brigades have formed in the Pine Forest Reserve and La Visite Park to reduce outsider&#13;
exploitation. Local populations are not integrated into management decisions and do not&#13;
tangibly benefit from protection. A substantial percentage of local inhabitants hold&#13;
insecure claims to state land.&#13;
1.9    Agriculture Sector Agriculture in terms of GDP contribution and employment&#13;
remains Haiti's most important economic sector, although its contribution has been&#13;
declining and is expected to continue its long-term decline. The decline is explained by,&#13;
among other factors, a lack of rural infrastructure, historic under-investment in rural&#13;
human capital, world decline in commodity prices and exposure to competition, stagnant&#13;
production technology, almost complete absence of formal credit sources and the&#13;
relentless pressure of the population on the country's very limited cultivable land&#13;
resources. These factors have led to unviably small farm sizes, overexploitation of land,&#13;
increases in the land values, and declining productivity per hectare and per worker. These&#13;
problems are complicated by a fluid and complex land tenure situation that can discourage&#13;
rational use of the available land resources. In addition, Government support services,&#13;
which should promote technological change, are practically non-existent. Structural and&#13;
policy changes in recent years include the demise of the sugar industry, the removal of&#13;
quantitative protection for traditional crops such as maize and rice, government subsidy of&#13;
rice imports, and the reduction or elimination of export taxes, now benefiting producers of&#13;
coffee, sisal and cocoa. International market developments have generally negatively&#13;
impacted on Haiti, in particular the significant decline of coffee and cocoa prices since&#13;
early 1989.&#13;
1.10  Information on Haiti's land use is limited to 1978 aerial photographs, which&#13;
indicate that nearly 80 percent of Haiti's area is devoted to agriculture in the broad sense,&#13;
including 62 percent for crop use and 18 percent extensive grazing. The net cultivated&#13;
area represents 11,900 kM2, or 44 percent of Haiti's land area. Twenty eight percent of&#13;
the net cultivated area is in tree crops, 13 percent in specialized crops, e.g., rice, and&#13;
59 percent in food crops mostly grown in the hilly areas.2 Against this pattern of extensive&#13;
land use are the estimates of BDPA that only 7,700 km2 (or 28 percent of the total land&#13;
area) is appropriate for conventionally mechanized agriculture. That would mean that&#13;
cultivation on land unsuited for agriculture is occurring on 20 percent to 30 percent of the&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
country's land area, the consequence of which is serious natural resource degradation and&#13;
extreme poverty for those who must farm such areas.&#13;
1.11   Rural poverty is pervasive, entrenched and severe. Available data for 1987, show&#13;
that about 65 percent of households could be classified as very poor. Households with an&#13;
average income one half the poverty threshold represented about 40 percent of the total&#13;
population. A recent study in Southern Haiti, the area of project intervention, estimated&#13;
average annual per capita income at US$120. The majority of this income derives from&#13;
agriculture, and secondly from petty commerce. Average annual net expenditures were&#13;
estimated at US$102. Female-headed households were significantly poorer than&#13;
male-headed, and over 20 percent of the population had annual incomes of less than&#13;
US$ 30.&#13;
B. Institutional Responsibilities and Constraints&#13;
1.12  A wide variety of institutions operate within the natural resources sector in Haiti.&#13;
Major Governmental entities include the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and&#13;
Rural Development (MARNDR), the Ministry of the Environment (MDE). These&#13;
institutions have, in general, broad mandates yet extremely limited capacities to execute.&#13;
The bulk of the operational interventions in the natural resources and energy sectors,&#13;
especially over the last three decades, have been conducted by non-governmental&#13;
organizations (NGOs). NGOs range tremendously in size, technical competence and&#13;
administrative capacity. These efforts are uncoordinated, and their impacts often&#13;
important, yet limited to local levels.&#13;

(MARNDR). The three principal objectives of MARNDR, as stated in its organic law,&#13;
are to promote agriculture, conservation and utilization of natural resources, and rural&#13;
development. Currently, the central structure of the Ministry is divided into Directorates.&#13;
There are four technical directorates (Livestock, Agriculture, Natural Resources, Rural&#13;
Development) charged with setting national strategy and policy in their respective domain.&#13;
In addition to the technical directorates, there is a Directorate of Training and Continuing&#13;
Education (DFPC), and a Directorate of Administration and a Directorate for each of the&#13;
nine regional Departments. These departmental directorates are charged with executing&#13;
and monitoring programs, and are each divided into sub-offices, one for each of the&#13;
132 rural communes. The Minister is assisted by a Director General who, in addition to&#13;
supervising all Directorates, supervises a technical secretariat and three other units: Unit&#13;
of Monitoring, Evaluation and Planning (UPSE), Center of Agricultural Development&#13;
Research (CRDA), and a machinery park. The departmental directorates report to the&#13;
Director General, and not directly to the specialized directorates or services.&#13;
1.14  Each directorate comprises a number of services for the different activities it is&#13;
supposed to provide. The Directorate of Natural Resources (DRN) comprises the&#13;
following six services: Irrigation and Rural Engineering, Soil Conservation, Water&#13;
Resources, Forest Resources, Meteorology, National Parks and Natural Sites, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Aquaculture and Fishing. However, most of these services are neither fully staffed nor&#13;
funded, and therefore have a limited ability to perform useful functions. The National&#13;
Parks and Natural Sites Service (SPNS) was created in January 1996 and is staffed with a&#13;
single individual with no program responsibilities. The SPNS was established on a&#13;
temporary basis, with the intent of transferring it to the Ministry of Environment (MDE)&#13;
upon passage of the MDE's organic law. The Forest Resources Service (SRF), which was&#13;
the primary focus of the World Bank-funded Pilot Forestry Project, is nominally&#13;
subdivided into five sections: management of natural forests, reforestation and&#13;
agroforestry, forestry statistics, and forestry research, although these sections are not&#13;
staffed. The personnel of the SRF entails a Chief of the Service, an Assistant Chief, one&#13;
agronomist, five agroforestry technicians, four forestry agents, and nine support staff.&#13;
Besides the Chief, who promotes forestry initiatives on a national level, staff efforts focus&#13;
on the Foret des Pins, National Forest Reserve.&#13;
1.15   MARNDR's effectiveness is constrained both by its structure and its limited&#13;
funding. Over the last several decades MARNDR's budget has constituted less than&#13;
3 percent of the national budget, and over 75 percent of this budget is expended on&#13;
salaries. The existing structure is highly centralized and causes problems of coordination,&#13;
in particular between the departmental directorates, the regional development&#13;
organizations, and the technical directorates of the central Ministry. Units operate&#13;
independently without clear lines of command and responsibilities. Consequently,&#13;
duplications of activities and waste of time and resources are common. For example, the&#13;
CRDA, responsible for technology generation and transfer, has no official relationship&#13;
with the departmental directorates, responsible for agricultural extension.&#13;
Decentralization has long been proposed as a means of increasing and improving the&#13;
delivery of services to the rural areas, and was, in fact, included in a 1982 Law, the 1987&#13;
Constitution, and a 1991 plan to reorganize the Ministry. However, no serious attempts&#13;
have been made to streamline MARNDR's operations. Past efforts were stifled by a very&#13;
high turn-over of ministers and senior staff, and the resultant discontinuity of policies and&#13;
strong political focus of all activities. The return of constitutional government and&#13;
anticipated political stability provides an opportunity to address these issues. In 1995 the&#13;
Ministry requested the FAO to assist in preparing a reorganization plan, but this plan was&#13;
rejected by early 1996. There are no new reorganization plans currently being considered.&#13;
1.16 Ministry of the Environment. The Ministry of the Environment (MDE) was&#13;
created by presidential decree in January of 1995 with a global mandate to protect Haiti's&#13;
environment. The MDE's specific mission and organizational structure are to be specified&#13;
with the passing of its organic law, which the Ministry submitted to Parliament during the&#13;
month of December 1995. The MDE is currently organized in the following manner: The&#13;
Minister is assisted by a personal Cabinet composed of three advisors (on a consultant&#13;
basis). The Director General, who directs the MDE line staff, is advised by a Technical&#13;
Secretariat composed of three technical experts (consultants). Line staff is organized in&#13;
four sections: Administration (ten persons); NEAP Coordination (two technical staff and&#13;
four consultants); Special Projects (two technical staff); and a Technical Team (two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
technical staff and three consultants). The MDE has received institutional and project&#13;
support mainly from USAID and UNDP.&#13;
1.17  Miscellaneous Institutions. Other institutional responsibilities for the&#13;
management of natural resources are found below. The impact of these institutions is&#13;
marginal, due to a lack of resources. (i) The Minyistry of Economy and Finance. Through&#13;
its tax authority, Direction Generale des Imp6ts (DGI), the Ministry manages the "private&#13;
domain of the state," i.e., state land that can be leased out, sold, donated or homesteaded&#13;
to individuals or corporations under contractual arrangements (this is in contrast to the&#13;
"public domain of the state," which is administered by other ministries and can also be&#13;
leased out but not alienated; national parks would belong to this latter category of&#13;
landholding; (ii) The Inistitlute for the Safeguard of the Nationial Patrimony (ISPAN). This&#13;
is a semi-autonomous Government agency under the Ministry of Education that shares&#13;
jurisdiction over national parks with the DRN; (iii) The National Tourism Office. This&#13;
agency shares jurisdiction over parks; and (iv) The Minlistry of Planning and External&#13;
Cooperation. The Ministry is charged with monitoring NGOs and land use planning.&#13;
1.18  NGOs in the Natural Resources Sector. NGOs have been the leading service&#13;
providers, and the leading centers for technical expertise in the agriculture and natural&#13;
resources sectors, since the early 1 980s when bilateral donors suspended assistance to the&#13;
Government. A survey conducted in 1989 found that over 300 NGOs provided rural&#13;
development services and that over 100 promoted tree planting. During the late 1980s,&#13;
and until the 1991 couip d'etat, total bilateral aid alone administered by NGOs in the&#13;
agriculture and natural resources sector is estimated to have exceeded US$ 10 million&#13;
annually. NGOs vary greatly in size, development philosophy and technical competence.&#13;
The NGOs with the greatest impact are the large international organizations with funding&#13;
from bilateral donors (e.g. CARE, the Pan American Development Foundation (PADF)).&#13;
These two organizations alone were providing agricultural extension services to over&#13;
30,000 peasants a year during the early 1990s. Local, Haitian NGOs (e.g. GRAMIR,&#13;
GATAP, GRD, SEFADES, ASSODLO) execute a wide variety of rural development and&#13;
natural resources projects and are gaining in number, expertise and administrative&#13;
competence. Some of the smaller NGOs (e.g. World Neighbors and the Mennonite&#13;
Central Committee) have been the source of significant technical and institutional&#13;
innovations in the sector.&#13;
C. Lessons From Experience&#13;
Country Lessons&#13;
1.19  MajorAgroforestryProjects (Agroforestry Outreach Project (AOP) (1981-1989);&#13;
Agroforestry II (AFII) (1990-1991); and Productive Land Use Systems (PLUS)&#13;
(1992-1999). These were the largest natural resource management projects in Haiti since&#13;
1980 and were all financed by USAID. The objective of the AOP was to promote&#13;
commercial tree production on private farm land without affecting food crop production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
USAID contributed US$27 million to this program between 1981 and 1990. During this&#13;
period about 50 million tree seedlings were distributed, involving more than 200,000&#13;
farms. Key lessons from the AOP and the AFII with relevance to the project include:&#13;
(a) using local NGOs as vehicles for extension packages was effective and efficient;&#13;
(b) peasants are eager to plant trees, especially when assured of harvest rights, and when&#13;
these trees can be easily integrated into their traditional agroforestry systems;&#13;
(c) investments in soil conservation usually yield more significant economic and&#13;
environmental benefits that tree planting; and (d) that peasants are eager to voluntarily&#13;
adopt soil conservation techniques when they require low labor inputs and can be easily&#13;
integrated into their farming system. These lessons are common across natural resource&#13;
management projects operating in Haiti during the 1980s. The PLUS project was&#13;
designed to integrate these lessons. It targets farm sites where production can be&#13;
intensified with simple soil conservation practices. The PLUS project demonstrates that it&#13;
is possible to simultaneously enhance family food security and yield environmental&#13;
benefits, and to do so in a cost-efficient manner. A key lesson from the major agroforestry&#13;
projects is that such efforts conducted outside of government structures further weaken&#13;
government capacity (by offering better salaries and working conditions to trained&#13;
personnel, and thus drawing technical staff away from the Ministry) and causing even&#13;
greater resentment and distrust between the government and NGO communities. The&#13;
proposed Forest and Parks Protection Technical Assistance Project (FPPTAP) will&#13;
integrate these lessons by hiring competent NGOs to promote the proven hillside&#13;
technologies under the strict technical supervision of government authorities. In this&#13;
manner, the project seeks to build a positive partnership between NGOs and government&#13;
authorities where each profit from the others' role and competence.&#13;
1.20 Macaya Biosphere Reserve (MBR) Project, University of Florida (1987-1992).&#13;
This project was the largest park protection and buffer zone management project in the&#13;
history of Haiti. It was also funded by USAID. The principal objective of the MBR&#13;
project was to protect the natural ecosystems (forests) and natural resources of the Pic&#13;
Macaya and surrounding areas, and thus assure the sustainable development of the park's&#13;
watershed area. Activities included: (a) planning the management of the park and&#13;
functional zoning for appropriate land use; (b) assisting the 1,750 peasants in the MBR to&#13;
increase agricultural production using ecologically appropriate methods; (c) rehabilitating&#13;
critical zones that have been environmentally degraded (e.g. steep slopes, springs,&#13;
endangered habitats); and (d) establishing an informational (data) history of the Pic&#13;
Macaya area. Project leaders distilled the following lessons after project closure in 1990:&#13;
(a) park protection cannot be achieved in a short-term period, long-term funding and&#13;
activities must be assured; (b) public support and local participation are essential to project&#13;
success, as well as the support of associated politicians and counterpart governmental&#13;
institutions; (c) co-management of the project, with the communities of the park area,&#13;
must be well established during the design phase to ensure local ownership; (d) because&#13;
income generation will be the overriding concern of the local community, a project can&#13;
easily become a mere source of livelihood for community participants, distorting the base&#13;
for any efforts at co-management; and (e) due to common social hierarchies, careful&#13;
selection and inclusion of local leaders as co-managers is essential in order to ensure a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
broader community support for project efforts. The FPPTA Project will integrate these&#13;
lessons by establishing permanent advisory co-management advisory councils composed of&#13;
representatives of local public and private organizations, and by establishing the basis for&#13;
long-term government presence in the Park areas. The project will also assure the&#13;
judicious use of labor-intensive projects to diminish the possibility of increasing&#13;
immigration and local dependence on government subsidized incomes.&#13;
1. 21 Pic Macaya Protection Project (PPM), UNICORS (1992- i 996). The PPM is the&#13;
follow-on to the MBR project described above. The PPM was designed to integrate some&#13;
of the lessons from the MBR project and focused more squarely on improving local&#13;
incomes and local participation in park management decisions. UNICORS, a local&#13;
cooperative of coffee producers with substantial private land holdings within the National&#13;
Park Boundary, was invited by USAID to implement the project. Most of the lessons&#13;
from the PPM are not different from those generated by the MBR. One particular lesson&#13;
is important, and that is that it is critical to hire service providers that are locally perceived&#13;
as fair and competent. UNICORS has been highly contentious, both because it is a large&#13;
landowner within the Park, and is seen by many as having a unfair vested interest in Park&#13;
development, rather that protection, and because it is a peasant cooperative with no&#13;
previous experience managing parks or executing major development programs. Two&#13;
additional lessons from national park management experience in Haiti are instructive:&#13;
(a) authoritative presence is requisite; and (b) basic protcction need not necessarily be&#13;
costly. Large-scale harvesting and invasions immediately followed the suspension of&#13;
guard services and extension projects in the Pic Macaya Park and Pine Forest Reserve&#13;
after the military coup of 1991. On the other hand, the La Visite Park was left largely&#13;
untouched. The only known difference is that a private individual paid La Visite park&#13;
guard salaries during the entire military regime period at a cost of about US$50 per&#13;
month.&#13;
Sector Lessons&#13;
1.22  Natural Reserve and Buffer Zone Management. An independent assessment of&#13;
Bank-supported protected area projects in 1993 concluded that: (a) too little&#13;
consideration had been given to local people, their expertise and their priorities; (b) NGO&#13;
services should have been used to a greater extent; and (c) long-term financing of such&#13;
projects was sometimes doubtful. Similar observations are found in the 1991 OED&#13;
analysis of forestry and conservation lending.&#13;
1.23   The principal lesson is that projects which have focused on purely biological&#13;
concerns, and have attempted to insulate the project site from surrounding economic and&#13;
social pressures, have often failed. The FPPTAP embodies the thesis that protection of&#13;
the biodiversity assets in the protected areas can only be achieved through significant&#13;
change in social and economic factors affecting the lives of people who live and work in&#13;
and around the reserves.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.24  Rural Development Funds. Bank experience with decentralized rural&#13;
development funds in Colombia and Mexico indicates that programs can be successful&#13;
when they: (a) give target group representatives a central role in program design and&#13;
grant selection; (b) clearly define objectives from the outset and explicitly focus on&#13;
enhancing rural management capacity; (c) have simple, widely publicized procedures and&#13;
respond rapidly, transparently and flexibly to proposals; (d) do not follow normal&#13;
government procurement and administration procedures; and (e) are apolitical and&#13;
perceived to be fair. In addition, evaluations found weaknesses in the technical quality of&#13;
some subprojects as well as limitations in the selection of subprojects. Non-governmental&#13;
and bilateral organizations have substantial experience funding productive projects in rural&#13;
Haiti. Their experience indicates that success is dependent upon quality, locally trusted,&#13;
technical assistance and close monitoring and evaluation. The FPPTAP was designed to&#13;
benefit from the above experiences by establishing a low-profile, decentralized,&#13;
demand-driven facility, and allocating funds on a formula basis, ensuring both consistency,&#13;
adequate technical assistance, and fairness.&#13;
Previous Bank Involvement in the Sector&#13;
1.25  National Forestry Project (PFN). The National Forestry Project, a pilot operation&#13;
that was implemented by MARNDR between 1982 and 1989, was financed jointly by IDA&#13;
(Credit 1257-HA, with US$4.0 million disbursed), the Government (US$0.75 million), the&#13;
International Research Center (US$0.3 million), and the French Agency for Voluntary&#13;
Services (US$0.6 million). The objectives of the project were: (a) the strengthening of&#13;
the MARNDR's Forest Service; (b) education and training in forestry; (c) species trials for&#13;
the production of woodfuel on 3 50 ha; (d) pilot plantations for woodfuel production and a&#13;
trial to determine the production impact of protection measures for the local savanna&#13;
vegetation; (e) partial management of the Pine Forest on 5,750 ha; (f) promotion of&#13;
improved cooking stoves for wood and charcoal; and (g) the preparation of a large-scale&#13;
follow-up project. Policy objectives included: (a) building up the operational capacity of&#13;
the Forest Service, including a strong extension element; (b) enacting and applying new&#13;
forestry legislation; and (c) developing economically viable reforestation and forest&#13;
management practices. The project was also to design a long-term plan for forestry&#13;
development.&#13;
1.26  The project had a slow start, suffered from shortages of counterpart funds and&#13;
political disturbances, and to complete the project, the IDA credit had to be extended by&#13;
two and a half years. Nevertheless, the project largely achieved its quantitative targets,&#13;
except for the primary education component, and the introduction of improved cooking&#13;
stoves. It was less successful in realizing its policy objectives. The enactment of new&#13;
forest legislation and the preparation of a long-term forestry development plan did not&#13;
materialize. Extension activities were limited to a partial census and some land leases in&#13;
the Pine Forest. Certain technical results, in particular those relating to the pilot&#13;
plantations, require further confirmation. In particular, the pilot plantings faced opposition&#13;
and intrusions from the local populations, and suffered from cattle damage and erratic&#13;
rainfall. The lessons identified in the Project Completion Report for this project include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
(a) a strategy for institutional development should be in place before project&#13;
implementation; (b) the Government should commit adequate budgetary resources for the&#13;
financing of operational costs; (c) a clear national forestry policy should be spelled out&#13;
before the project; (d) Government should be committed to enact and apply new forest&#13;
legislation; and (e) a purely technocratic approach to forestry development, i.e., without&#13;
due consideration of the social dimension and involvement of people, is not feasible in&#13;
Haiti. The Project integrates these lessons by assuring adequate funding and priority for&#13;
institutional development and by establishing a permanent co-management system for each&#13;
national reserve that would offer voice and authority to key actors with vested interests in&#13;
the reserves.&#13;
1.27 Forestry and Environment Protection Project (FEPP). This project was intended&#13;
as a follow-up operation to the IDA-supported Forestry Development Project&#13;
(Cr. 1257-HA), which closed on December 31, 1989. The project was to provide&#13;
technical and financial support for: (a) institutional strengthening of the MARNDR's&#13;
Directorate of Natural Resources, through improvement of administrative facilities,&#13;
staffing and operations, management and training; (b) specific forestry and environment&#13;
programs, including the provision of agroforestry extension services to some&#13;
16,000 farmers through contracts with NGOs; and (c) promotion by the BME of more&#13;
efficient charcoal stoves to conserve wood fuels. The project objectives were to increase&#13;
agroforestry productivity, maintain and develop timber resources in the Pine Forest&#13;
Reserve, reduce the domestic demand for charcoal, and to develop the institutions,&#13;
technology and approach to agroforestry which would lay the groundwork for future&#13;
projects in the sector. Although the project never became effective, due to the crisis in&#13;
1991, the major lesson learned was that the activities proposed for the project were and&#13;
remain vital to Haiti's sustainable economic development, and now to Haiti's immediate&#13;
reconstruction needs, especially those activities directly targeted to the rural poor.&#13;
D. Government Objectives and Strategy&#13;
1.28 The Government. Upon its reestablishment, the Constitutional Government&#13;
presented a coherent economic and social rehabilitation program to face the problems and&#13;
challenges ahead, and the international donor community confirmed support for the&#13;
Government's reform efforts. Apart from the preparation of the rehabilitation program,&#13;
these efforts have included the preparation of parliamentary elections, an agreement with&#13;
the IMF on a stand-by arrangement, and the initiation of economic policy reforms. At the&#13;
January 1995 Consultative Group (CG) meeting held in Paris, and again at the CG&#13;
Follow-up meeting in Port-au-Prince in May 1995, donors pledged and confirmed over&#13;
US$1.5 billion in support of the Government's efforts. Since that time, the Government&#13;
has held legislative elections and the new president Mr. Rene Preval began his term on&#13;
February 7, 1995.&#13;
1.29 The new Government's stated development objectives are: (a) recovery and&#13;
sustained growth; (b) poverty alleviation, and improved access to social services; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
(c) agricultural reform and environmental rehabilitation. While these overall objectives are&#13;
similar to those of other developing countries, it is the present emergency situation and the&#13;
profound changes required which present the extraordinary challenge in the case of Haiti.&#13;
The new Government under President Preval has committed itself to redefine its role in&#13;
the economy. In spring 1996 it announced a comprehensive privatization program and&#13;
economic policy reforms to establish a sound macroeconomic and incentive framework&#13;
conducive to private sector development. High priority will be given to increase&#13;
Government capacity to deliver essential basic services in health and education,&#13;
cooperating with NGOs active in those fields. Finally, it assigned a very high priority to&#13;
agricultural reform and to address the country's severely deteriorated environmental&#13;
conditions to sustain future growth.&#13;
1.30  To achieve its development objectives the Government is committed to&#13;
fundamentally refocus the role of the state. It aims to establish a framework of good&#13;
governance by increasing its accountability and strengthening its administration, and&#13;
setting up a functioning judiciary. Further core aspects are a comprehensive civil service&#13;
reform and a continued decentralization process. This transition is planned in a process of&#13;
national reconciliation and respect for democratic rule.&#13;
1.31   The Agriculture and Natural Resources Sector. Government goals in this&#13;
sector include: (a) enhancing food security; (b) reducing the on-going process of natural&#13;
resource degradation (soil, water, and forests); (c) developing agroindustries and growth&#13;
of agro-exports; (d) improving land tenure security; and (e) strengthening sector&#13;
institutions. Activities programmed for the sector include: (a) MARNDR reorganization&#13;
and decentralization of roles and responsibilities to regional representatives;&#13;
(b) establishment of a work program and research agenda for the recently created National&#13;
Agrarian Reform Institute (INARA), with IDA and IDB technical and financial assistance;&#13;
(c) expansion of current irrigation infrastructure and the creation of new systems; (d) other&#13;
projects to curb the pace of natural resource degradation; (e) a program to expand the&#13;
provision of rural financial services; (f) establishment of a development fund that would&#13;
finance productive rural projects; (g) technical assistance and credit to agroindustries and&#13;
rural micro-enterprises; and (h) reform of policies governing natural resource management&#13;
and national park protection.&#13;
E. Donor Strategies and Activities&#13;
1.32  Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy. The Bank Group's assistance to&#13;
Haiti involves a two-pronged approach. In the very short-term, IDA has provided&#13;
emergency financing for the Government's Emergency Economic Reconstruction Program&#13;
(EERP), and has worked quickly to reactivate its earlier ongoing projects in the country.&#13;
Particular attention is being paid to aid coordination and ensuring that donor efforts are&#13;
complementary rather than duplicative. Major projects in the health, urban power,&#13;
industrial infrastructure, urban water, and major road sectors have been reactivated. With&#13;
a view to the medium-term, IDA is working with the Government on the formulation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13-&#13;
strategies for structural reforms essential to reviving economic growth, poverty alleviation&#13;
and environmental rehabilitation. Projects in this category include, primarily, major&#13;
structural adjustment and technical assistance credits. Ongoing IDA projects relevant to&#13;
the proposed project include the Economic and Social Funid (ESF), which finances the&#13;
construction of socially-beneficial civil works, primarily in urban areas, and the&#13;
Employment Generation Project (EGP), which provides temporary jobs for infrastructure&#13;
rehabilitation and water management in both rural and urban areas.&#13;
1.33   Agriculture, Forestry and Environmental Protection. Approximately&#13;
20 percent of total ODA investment in Haiti since the 1970s has been in these sectors.&#13;
Current levels of funding approximate past levels. Major donors in these sectors include&#13;
the IDB, the UNDP, CFD, USAID and CIDA. The IDB has a strategic focus on&#13;
irrigation and water management. It has reactivated a number of major irrigation projects&#13;
and is in the process of planning additional interventions in the water sector. In addition,&#13;
the IDB is financing a major pig repopulation program and is considering future credits in&#13;
rural finance, rural development funds, and agricultural institution reform. USAID has&#13;
long had a strategic focus on promoting sustainable hillside production. It has several&#13;
ongoing projects combining resource conservation and peasant production, including the&#13;
aforementioned PLUS project and a project to revitalize coffee production and marketing.&#13;
Since 1987 USAID has also financed an integrated development and park protection&#13;
project in the Pic Macaya area. Financing for this project, along with all field activities,&#13;
will terminate in September 1996. USAID also funds a project to promote&#13;
micro-enterprises in rural areas, and a seed multiplication project. USAID is also the&#13;
major sponsor of the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) currently being&#13;
prepared by the MDE. The NEAP is a major Government activity toward assessing and&#13;
prioritizing environmental issues and actions in Haiti. The World Bank has also recently&#13;
approved a Institutional Development Grant to the MDE to support NEAP preparation.&#13;
The UNDP funds a variety of small projects in the sector including several&#13;
regionally-targeted soil conservation projects implemented by MARNDR and MDE, a&#13;
project to deliver agricultural inputs, and a project to enhance community water&#13;
management. In addition, UNDP funds a separate project unit (the Environmental&#13;
Coordination and Monitoring Unit) that monitors environmental indicators, provides&#13;
technical assistance to the MDE and manages a small projects fund for environmental&#13;
projects. The MFC funds a wide variety of projects in the sector. These include:&#13;
improved seed production; improvement of small irrigation systems, pig repopulation,&#13;
agricultural sector studies. In addition, they manage a small grants fund for productive&#13;
projects. CIDA similarly funds a variety of projects. These include, the distribution of&#13;
agricultural inputs and tools, labor intensive civil works, and a project that seeks to&#13;
strengthen Haitian producers cooperatives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
2.1   The proposed project is an updated version of the defunct Forestry and&#13;
Environmental Protection Project (FEPP) (CR. 2301-HA) that was approved by the IDA&#13;
Board in 1991 and withdrawn March 1, 1994 during the military regime. An&#13;
Implementation Completion Note (Report No. 13816) was issued on December 27, 1994.&#13;
The project is fully consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy. The protection and&#13;
rehabilitation of critical ecosystems is a high priority of the Government as expressed in&#13;
the draft Policy Framework Paper, the Emergency Economic Recovery Credit&#13;
(Cr. 2670-.HA) and the draft program under the proposed Structural Adjustment Credit, as&#13;
well as repeated Government requests. The proposed project is the first major action to&#13;
respond to Government requests to protect Haiti's remaining environmental resources&#13;
among all major donors. It is also the first step in the World Bank's pledge (stated at the&#13;
December 1994 Paris Consultative Group meetings and included in the draft CAS) to&#13;
prepare projects to protect and rehabilitate the environment. The Government of Haiti has&#13;
received a US$ 2.0 million Project Preparation Facility to finance urgent activities to&#13;
protect threatened Haitian ecosystems.&#13;
2.2    Within the Government's and Bank's strategy, the proposed Forest and Park&#13;
Protection Technical Assistance Project would emphasize protection services for national&#13;
parks and forest reserves, and agricultural support services, including agroforestry, to&#13;
farmers in and around the protected areas. It is expected that these efforts would generate&#13;
viable solutions for larger-scale investment in reforestation and natural resource&#13;
management. IDA's role in the proposed project, and indeed the rationale for IDA's&#13;
continued involvement with forestry and environmental concerns, is to assist the&#13;
Government in designing and implementing consistent policies, institutional strengthening,&#13;
and field operations which make maximum use of the scarce human resources&#13;
(Government, NGOs and rural workers/farmers) to tackle natural resource issues&#13;
countrywide. The project is designed to attract other donor agencies and to provide an&#13;
institutional framework within which to implement the TFAP and National Environmenta!&#13;
Action Plan. The project concept is based on the collective experience from the&#13;
IDA-supported Pilot Forestry Project, the NGO agroforestry and soil conservation&#13;
projects financed by bilateral agencies, the Government's strategy for natural resource&#13;
development, and Haiti's National Energy Plan (in preparation).&#13;
B. Objectives and Summary Description&#13;
Objectives&#13;
2.3   The. overall objective of the project is to start the initial phase of intervention for&#13;
the protection of critical remnants of Haiti's forest ecosystems and for slowing the pace of&#13;
degradation of Haiti's natural resources. The project would establish the institutional,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
policy and financial foundation for the Government of Haiti to sustain protection of critical&#13;
ecosystems on a nation-wide basis. The three specific objectives of the project are to:&#13;
(a)   provide institutional support to MDE and related services within&#13;
MARNDR for strengthening the Government's institutional capacity to&#13;
develop, monitor and enforce a national forest and parks protection system;&#13;
(b)   initiate key activities to protect and manage the La Visite and Pic Macaya&#13;
National Parks and the Pine Forest National Forest Reserve; and&#13;
(c)   reduce pressure on the above-mentioned protected areas by increasing&#13;
on-farm productivity and off-farm employment options, and enhancing the&#13;
management capacity of local organizations in the buffer areas of the three&#13;
targeted areas.&#13;
2.4   The project would achieve its objectives by financing technical assistance, technical&#13;
and policy studies, training, equipment, limited civil works, and incremental operating&#13;
costs required to implement the components described below:&#13;
Project Description&#13;
2.5   Component 1: Institutional Strengthening and Reform (US$7.5 million&#13;
estimated total cost). This component would enable Government (MDE) to start&#13;
developing the policy and administrative framework required to undertake its role of&#13;
normative and regulatory functions in the area of natural resources protection, while&#13;
simultaneously reorganizing and strengthening the relevant implementation entities to&#13;
perform their role and functions. Support would be provided to a Project Coordinating&#13;
Unit (PCU) within MDE including personnel and operating expenditures for the&#13;
coordination, administration and overall supervision of the execution of the project.&#13;
Within this component, project financing would include provision for a series of studies to&#13;
define procedures and mechanisms to implement new subsector strategies and policies&#13;
related to natural resources protection. This component would also provide basic&#13;
conservation training to forest and park technicians and guards, external short courses for&#13;
the section heads and unit chiefs of the Forest Resources and Park Services from&#13;
MARNDR, and training for the Advisory Committees (to be established under the project)&#13;
in reserve and parks management and organization. Technical assistance would be&#13;
provided according to project demands and would be coordinated by the PCU.&#13;
2.6   Component 2: Support for the Management of Forest and National Parks&#13;
(US$3.9 million estimated total cost). This component would provide support for: (i) the&#13;
development of a sustainable management system for the existing Pine Forest National&#13;
Reserve and the strengthening of Forestry Services (SRF) and; (ii) the protection and&#13;
sustainable management of the Pic Macaya and La Visite National Parks Reserve, and the&#13;
strengthening of Parks Services (SPNS). Specific management activities include&#13;
identifying and delimiting reserve boundaries, establishing a sustainable land management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
plan within the Forest Reserve, preserving vital ecological zones, establishing and&#13;
coordinating local Advisory Committees for each national park and reserve, promoting&#13;
ecotourism, preparing and executing reserve management plans, conducting social and&#13;
biophysical surveys of reserves; and monitoring biophysical change and project impact.&#13;
While no cutting would be carried out in the national parks, in the multi-purpose national&#13;
forest reserve of Foret des Pins, the project envisages non-commercial thinning operations&#13;
and Christmas tree production, the benefits of which would be distributed to local&#13;
communities. No commercial logging would be executed during the life of the project.&#13;
No resettlement is planned or envisioned during the life of the project. Nonetheless, the&#13;
Government has agreed to prepare resettlement plans in accordance with Bank guidelines&#13;
in the event that it chooses to relocate landholders.&#13;
2.7    Component 3: Support for Buffer Zone Development (US$9.1 million&#13;
estimated total cost). This component would seek to reduce pressure on the reserves,&#13;
diversify sources of local household incomes and enhance environmental benefits in the&#13;
buffer areas. This component would support: (i) provision of agroforestry, soil&#13;
conservation and agriculture extension services to farmers living in and near the three&#13;
reserves in order to rehabilitate natural resources and boost on-farm productivity;&#13;
(ii) provision of technical assistance and financing for assisting the farming community in&#13;
the buffer zones with the design and implementation of small investment subprojects&#13;
through a participatory planning process. Under this subcomponent, a Buffer Zone Small&#13;
Investment Facility (BZSIF) would provide financing, on a matching grant basis, for&#13;
productive micro-development projects (e.g., beekeeping, small livestock, produce&#13;
storage, transformation and marketing) proposed by producer groups to increase incomes&#13;
and off-farm employment opportunities, as well as priority community investments for&#13;
sustainable natural resources management (e.g., gully protection, rainfed terraces, tree&#13;
plantation on marginal lands). Management of the BZSIF subcomponent would be&#13;
contracted out to FAES3 (or any suitable organization). Eligibility criteria for the BZSIF&#13;
would require that small investment subprojects: (i) are identified by rural communities&#13;
through a participatory process and included in a coherent local development plan; (ii) are&#13;
explicitly oriented to strengthening producer groups, and; (iii) are oriented to small-scale&#13;
rural productive activities, and/or to improve natural resources management. Grant&#13;
approval would be made by the Local Grant Evaluation Committees (LGEC) according to&#13;
pre-established, social, environmental and economic criteria. Detailed BZSIF eligibility&#13;
criteria and financing procedures, as well as the composition, roles and functions of the&#13;
LGEC are described in the Management Services Contract with the implementing&#13;
organization.&#13;
3     FAES is the Government executing agency of the on-going Economic and Social Fund project&#13;
(ESF). A follow-up ESF II is under preparation.&#13;

3. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
A. Project Costs&#13;
3.1    The estimated cost of the five-year project, exclusive of duties and taxes, is&#13;
US$22.5 mnillion equivalent, of which US$21.5 million would be financed by a IDA credit&#13;
and the remainder by the Government of Haiti, participating NGOs and beneficiaries.&#13;
During project preparation, mechanisms for increasing direct contributions from NGOs&#13;
and local beneficiaries would be explored, particularly with reference to buffer zone&#13;
development activities. Project costs were based on January 1996 prices. Because of&#13;
macroeconomic instability and, until recently, an administered exchange rate, costs are&#13;
presented in US dollars; US dollars have been used for costing all off-shore procurement&#13;
and consultancy services; local costs have been converted at the exchange rate of&#13;
G 15/US$1. Physical contingencies have been applied as follows: 15 percent for civil&#13;
works, and 5 percent for all other cost items, except salaries, for which no physical&#13;
contingency has been included. Price contingencies are based on the Bank's projections&#13;
for intemational, estimated at an average of 3.9 percent per annum for the period 1990 to&#13;
2000. The Government would continue to provide the staff required for the&#13;
implementation of the project that is already from the previous project and financed from&#13;
MARNDR's regular budget. The project's total annual recurrent costs after year five of&#13;
the project, in constant values, are estimated at US$0.7 million per year, including&#13;
0.5 million for salaries and 0.2 million for operating costs. Total project costs and project&#13;
financing are shown respectively in Tables I and 2.&#13;

4. PROJ1ECT IMPLEMENTATION AND REPORTING&#13;
A. Project Coordination, Management and Implementation&#13;
4.1    Overall Coordination. The Government implementing agency would be the&#13;
Ministry of Environment (MDE). MDE would establish a Project Coordinating Unit&#13;
(PCU) under its General Directorate to assist the Ministry in coordinating and&#13;
administering the overall project implementation. The PCU would comprised an&#13;
experienced Coordinator, an Administrator (assisted himself by a procurement expert, and&#13;
an accountant), a Reporting and Evaluation Specialist, and sufficient support-level staff,&#13;
including a trilingual secretary (Creole-French-English). Except for the management of&#13;
the BZSIF, a Procurement Agent would be contracted for handling all aspects of&#13;
procurement for the project in close collaboration with the relevant executing public&#13;
entities. The Agent would operate in a manner consistent with the institutional&#13;
strengthening objectives of the project and work towards enabling the PCU to eventually&#13;
carry out all procurement tasks. The PCU would coordinate project implementation,&#13;
project procurement, and technical assistance; and prepare work programs, budgets and&#13;
progress reports. This small unit would coordinate project activities to be implemented by&#13;
MARNDR line agencies (SRF, SPNS, DFPC, CRDA) through an inter-ministerial&#13;
arrangement, and by contracted NGOs and other entities. Under a management services&#13;
contract, FAES (or the selected private firm) will be responsible for the procurement of&#13;
works, goods, and services for the management of the BZSIF. The PCU would review&#13;
the plans and budgets of contracted agencies or entities, and approve disbursements.&#13;
4.2   Detailed composition of this unit, minimum qualifications and appointment periods&#13;
for each staff were reviewed at appraisal. Mainly, the Coordinator would lead the unit,&#13;
and be responsible through the General Director for contractual arrangements between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
MDE and the executing entities, and for co-signing disbursement and/or expense&#13;
authorizations along with the Administrator. Under the Coordinator's supervision, the&#13;
Administrator would be responsible for establishing and monitoring the unit's&#13;
administrative and accountant systems, and would co-sign, along with the Administrator,&#13;
disbursement and expense authorizations. He would be assisted by an experimented&#13;
Accountant for book keeping and daily routine operations and by a Procurement Specialist&#13;
to ensure compliance with the agreed procurement procedures. Also under the&#13;
Coordinator's supervision, the Reporting and Evaluation Specialist would be responsible&#13;
for establishing the data collection, information management and reporting systems&#13;
necessary to monitor the project implementation and management.&#13;
4.3   During negotiations, Government agreement was obtained on the following: (a) to&#13;
establish the PCU prior to project effectiveness and to staff this unit with professional and&#13;
support personnel satisfactory to IDA; (b) project implementation and financing would be&#13;
on the basis of detailed annual work programs and budgets that would be prepared by the&#13;
project's implementing services or entities and compiled by the PCU; (c) the PCU would&#13;
submit to IDA the proposed annual work programs and budgets no later than September I&#13;
of each year for IDA's review and comment; and (d) PCU would advise IDA of any&#13;
subsequent addition or modifications in the program content, cost and scheduling and seek&#13;
IDA approval.&#13;
Project Implementation&#13;
4.4   Institutional Strengthening Component. During implementation, the project&#13;
would provide national and international short-term consultant services to identify and&#13;
engage as needed specialized technical support. In addition, as mentioned earlier, a&#13;
Procurement Agent would be contracted to help the PCU on procurement matters. The&#13;
project mid-term review would determine the need for further support on procurement.&#13;
4.5   Natural Reserve Management Component. An inter-ministerial arrangement&#13;
would be established between MDE and MARNDR for the technical supervision and&#13;
management of the forest and parks environmental protection component. Specifically,&#13;
the Forest Resource Service would supervise and implement activities in and around the&#13;
Pine Forest while the Park Service would supervise and implement activities in and around&#13;
the parks. The project would finance provisions of the material and human resources to&#13;
strengthen the two services (SRF and SPNS) and those of their sections that implement&#13;
project supported programs; particularly, the heads of SRF and SPNS would benefit&#13;
assistance from respectively a Conservation Specialist and a Forest Management&#13;
Specialist. These sections already exist but are understaffed and underfunded.&#13;
Implementation of activities under the training and technical assistance sub-component of&#13;
the technology generation and transfer sub-components would be attributed through&#13;
similar implementation arrangements to the Directorate of Training (DFPC) and the&#13;
Center for Research and Agricultural Development (CRDA) under the MARNDR, and/or&#13;
through contracts to private institutions and organizations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
4.6   Buffer Zone Development Component. Supervision and coordination of the&#13;
conservation and development extension services component also would be delegated&#13;
through similar arrangements to CRDA. The inter-ministerial arrangement would be&#13;
established between MDE and CDRA to provide those services. Private institutions&#13;
and/or NGOs would be contracted to provide technical assistance in agricultural&#13;
production and soil conservation to farmers living in the targeted areas. MDE would also&#13;
enter into a Management Services Contract with FAES, or any other qualified and&#13;
experienced private institution or organization, for the establishment and management of&#13;
the Buffer Zone Small Investment Facility. The maximum size of eligible subprojects&#13;
under the BZSIF will not exceed US$100,000.&#13;
B. Procurement&#13;
4.7   The Government of Haiti is revising its procurement procedures. The GOH would&#13;
agree to carry out all procurement financed by IDA for this project according to Bank&#13;
guidelines. The PCU would be adequately staffed to manage procurement. In addition, it&#13;
has been agreed that a procurement agent would be contracted during the first years of the&#13;
project to process procurement work. For the management of the BZSIF, FAES, given its&#13;
capacity and experience in managing procurement for the ongoing Economic and Social&#13;
Fund project, would have full responsibility for all aspects of procurement for subprojects&#13;
to be financed under the BZSIF. In the case of any other private institution or&#13;
organization, their selection criteria would include in particular their capacity for managing&#13;
procurement. All procurement of goods and works will be carried out according to the&#13;
Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement" dated January 1995. Bank-issued standard bidding&#13;
documents will be used for procurement through LIB.&#13;
4.8   Works, e.g., the rehabilitation of the access and internal roads for the La Visite&#13;
National Park and in the Pine Forest Reserve and buildings in the national park, office&#13;
building rehabilitation, nurseries and guard houses, and works for subprojects to be&#13;
financed in the Buffer zone areas under the BZSIF estimated to cost less than US$50,000&#13;
per contract and in total not more than US$1.0 million would be procured under lump&#13;
sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three&#13;
qualified contractors in response to a written invitation. Because of the minor scope of&#13;
these works and their scattered location, they would not attract international contractors.&#13;
Within the scope of maintenance of the rehabilitated access or internal roads and buildings,&#13;
and of some subprojects to be financed in the Buffer zone areas under the BZSIF, direct&#13;
contracting with local community organizations on the basis of reference unit prices and&#13;
standardized quantities will be permitted for contracts valued at less than US$50,000 but&#13;
not exceeding US$2.Omillion, in aggregate.&#13;
4.9   Vehicles and Equipment. There will be no contracts for goods over&#13;
US$100,000, thus no ICB is expected. Vehicles and equipment (including in particular,&#13;
office equipment and computers) estimated to cost between US$50,000 and US$100,000&#13;
for an aggregate of US$900,000 would be procured through LIB in lots of at least&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
US$50,000, among suppliers with service and maintenance facilities in Haiti. Equipment&#13;
contracts estimated to cost less than US$50,000 each would be procured through&#13;
international shopping. National shopping procedures would be applied for contracts&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$25,000. Shopping procedures would also be used for&#13;
purchases of goods estimated to cost US$1.2 million in total for subprojects financed&#13;
under the BZSIF. The use of national shopping will be limited to an aggregate contract&#13;
value of US$840,000 and the use of international shopping to an aggregate value of&#13;
US$1,260,000 for the project (including the BZSIF).&#13;
4.10  Consultant services, training and studies. All consultanis services, including&#13;
individual consultants, consulting firms and NGOs providing extension services will be&#13;
procured under contracts awarded in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for the Use&#13;
of Consultants" dated August 1981. Such consultants contracts will be based on standard&#13;
forms of contract issued by the Bank, or, as appropriate, on other standard forms&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. Financing for training tours and fellowships will be based on a&#13;
detailed program to be submitted to IDA for approval.&#13;
4.11  Management Services Contract. The Management Services contract to be&#13;
established with FAES, or any other qualified and experienced private institution or&#13;
organization to be selected on a competitive basis, for the establishment and management&#13;
of the Buffer Zone Small Investment Facility would be submitted to IDA for its approval.&#13;
The detailed procurement procedures for subprojects under the BZSIF would follow&#13;
Bank's procurement procedures for works and goods as described earlier.&#13;
4.12 Review by IDA. All LIB contracts would be subject to prior IDA review of&#13;
bidding documents, bid evaluation, award proposals and final contracts. Because of the&#13;
contracting of the Procurement Agent, prior review of all consultant contracts and&#13;
selection processes would only be required for contracts with firms exceeding US$50,000&#13;
and with individuals exceeding US$30,000. IDA prior review would also be required for&#13;
the terms of reference for all single source selection of consulting firms and all critical&#13;
assignments. All other contracts will be subject to post-review. These arrangements&#13;
would result in prior review by the Bank of an estimated 50 percent of the value of all&#13;
IDA-financed contracts. In addition, the Bank's prior approval would be required for all&#13;
subprojects under the BZSIF which benefit from grants of US$50,000 or more and all&#13;
BZSIF subprojects would be subject to interim evaluation of project operation by the&#13;
BZSIF managers, as well as field visits by PCU staff as part of the BZSIF monitoring and&#13;
evaluation system.&#13;
C. Disbursement&#13;
4.13  The proposed IDA credit would be disbursed over about five years, starting in late&#13;
December 1996. The formal Credit Closing Date would be December 31, 2001. IDA&#13;
would disburse at a rate of 100 percent for all project expenditures except those&#13;
contributed by counter-part funds, implementing entities or organizations, and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22 -&#13;
beneficiaries themselves. Annex A, Table 8-1 shows the allocation of Credit proceeds.&#13;
The estimated disbursement schedule is presented in Table 3.&#13;

4.14   The Borrower would establish a Special Account in US dollars in the Central Bank&#13;
of Haiti or in any commercial bank acceptable to IDA, with an authorized allocation of&#13;
US$1.3 million, equal to about four months' estimated average disbursements. However,&#13;
the initial deposit to the Special Account would be limited to US$500,000 until&#13;
US$3.5 million has been disbursed from the Credit Account when additional deposits may&#13;
be requested up to the amount of the initial deposit has been withdrawn, whichever comes&#13;
first. In addition to documentation requirements indicated in the following paragraph,&#13;
replenishment application will include monthly bank statements showing account activity&#13;
since the last application and a reconciliation statement. Because of the critical nature of&#13;
effective project start-up, including the launching of natural reserve protection activities,&#13;
retroactive financing would be provided for up to 10 percent of the IDA Credit for project&#13;
activities incurred after May 15, 1996, but no more than one year from date of signing.&#13;
Initial natural reserve protection, and information campaigns are being financed under a&#13;
$2.0 million PPF (P-959-0-HA).&#13;
4.15   All disbursements that do not have a prior review requirement would be made on&#13;
the basis of statements of expenditures (SOEs), including incremental operating cost. Use&#13;
of SOEs for goods and works would be limited to contracts costing less than US$50,000.&#13;
Use of SOEs for consultant services would be limited to contracts with consulting firms or&#13;
individuals costing US$50,000 or US$30,000 or less, respectively. Information required&#13;
for the SOEs would be available in the project data base, updated monthly by the PCU.&#13;
All supporting documentation would be made available to IDA for review.&#13;
D. Accounts and Audit&#13;
4.16 The PCU will maintain a separate project account to reflect all project expenditure.&#13;
This account would be audited each year by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The&#13;
audited report would be submitted to IDA no later than four months after the end of the&#13;
fiscal year. Expenditures related to the audits would be eligible for financing under the&#13;
4     Including refund of PPF and retroactive financing of up to US$2.5 million for eligible&#13;
expenditures incurred after May 15, 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23 -&#13;
Credit. The audit reports would convey the auditor's opinion and comments as necessary&#13;
on the methodology employed in the compilation of the SOEs, their accuracy, the&#13;
relevance of supporting documents, eligibility for financing in terms of the project's legal&#13;
agreements, and standards of record keeping and internal controls related to the above,&#13;
and the status of the special account. The TOR for the auditors would also include a&#13;
specific analysis of compliance with procurement procedures, including physical audits as&#13;
appropriate. Assurances were given during negotiations of above arrangements for&#13;
accounts and audits.&#13;
E. Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting&#13;
4.17  Continuous monitoring of the project activities would be carried out by the PCU&#13;
which would undertake corrective actions, advise the implementing units on necessary&#13;
actions, and inform higher levels of Government on project issues and performance. The&#13;
PCU would prepare quarterly progress reports on all activities carried out under the&#13;
project, based on the individual monthly reports from the contracted executing including&#13;
MARNDR agencies, NGOs and FAES. The quarterly progress reports would compare&#13;
actual project implementation with the approved Annual Work Programs and Budgets,&#13;
and highlight issues and problems of project implementation and outline possible&#13;
corrective actions, for comment by the Government, IDA and monitoring agencies, and&#13;
would be submitted to IDA no later than 60 days after the end of the quarter. The&#13;
performance monitoring indicators (Annex B) were agreed during negotiation.&#13;
4.18  In addition to the quarterly progress report, PCU would prepare according to the&#13;
Project Annual Operation Plan (AOP) a detailed annual report summarizing the&#13;
implementation status of the agreed on-going AOP. The AOP for the subsequent year&#13;
which would include all the necessary investment and operation budget provision should&#13;
be available for IDA consideration prior to September I of each year, and would be&#13;
reviewed during IDA annual review.&#13;
4.19  To assist in project implementation, IDA would carry out during the first two&#13;
years of implementation at least three review missions per year; the third one would&#13;
coincide with the project annual review. The annual review would take place by July 31&#13;
of each year beginning in 1997 with the participation of representatives of PCU, other&#13;
implementing entities or organizations, and IDA. The annual review would focus on&#13;
technical, financial, administrative and environmental aspects of the project; particular&#13;
attention would be paid to progress evaluation vis-a-vis implementation objectives and&#13;
impact indicators. This evaluation would serve as a basis for discussion about issues and&#13;
problems related to project management and implementation. The results of this annual&#13;
review would be an agreement on the next annual work program and on required&#13;
corrective actions to address those problems or any major change in the general context&#13;
during project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24 -&#13;
4.20  The Government, with assistance from independent consultants, would carry out a&#13;
Mid-Term Review of on project performance, the results of which would provide the basis&#13;
for necessary adjustments in project design and funding allocation. In addition to all the&#13;
areas covered by the annual review, the mid-term review would focus on compliance to&#13;
the action program, including: (a) institutional structure and administrative performance&#13;
of the MDE; (b) progress achieved in reforming and enforcing sector policies;&#13;
(c) effectiveness of technical assistance provided by the project; (d) experience with&#13;
environmental impact assessment of sub-projects; (e) assessment of the need for further&#13;
support on procurement through the Procurement Agent; and (f) preparation of steps&#13;
necessary to establish sustainable financial mechanisms for protecting critical forest&#13;
ecosystems and parks in Haiti. It was agreed during negotiations that the mid-term&#13;
evaluation would be completed by March 31, 1999. To accomplish this: (a) independent&#13;
consultants to assist in the evaluation would be hired by October 1, 1998; and (b) the draft&#13;
report would be available for review by IDA by June 1999. As a standard requirement of&#13;
IDA lending, the Borrower shall also prepare a post-Project Implementation Plan at the&#13;
end of the project investment period.&#13;
5. PROJECT ANALYSIS&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
5.1   The Forest and National Park Management and Buffer Zone Development&#13;
Components, representing 64 percent of project baseline costs (excluding project&#13;
preparation costs), would generate significant on-and off-site benefits. The Forest and&#13;
National Park Management Component, by administering the La Visite and Pic Macaya&#13;
National Parks and the Foret des Pins National Reserve, would protect valuable forest&#13;
ecosystems, contain the degradation of forest resources and safeguard the country's&#13;
eco-tourism potential. In addition, these activities would yield important downstream&#13;
off-site benefits including greater efficiency in irrigation system and a reduction in flood&#13;
related damages. The Buffer Zone Development Component, by increasing agricultural&#13;
productivity, diversifying income sources, and generating employment options, as well as&#13;
enhancing local natural resource management capabilities, would improve the welfare of&#13;
the rural household, conserve natural resources and reduce pressures for encroachment in&#13;
the protected areas.&#13;
Forest and National Park Management Component&#13;
5.2    On-site benefits. Within the protected areas, three main categories of benefits are&#13;
likely to be generated: preservation of biodiversity, recreational/tourist benefits, and&#13;
harvest of forest products. Preservation of biodiversity. The three protected areas, and&#13;
particularly the Pic Macaya and La Visite National Parks, are important natural habitats&#13;
because of their genetic diversity, including many species endemic to the area and few&#13;
such ecosystems remain in Hispaniola. Because of its altitude range, the Macaya area&#13;
supports mature broad-leaved forests as well as cloud forest, thus creating numerous&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25 -&#13;
micro-catchments with a rich diversity of species. Of the nearly 500 flora recorded in the&#13;
Macaya, about a third are endemic to Hispaniola and 15 percent to the Macaya area.&#13;
Aside from its rich diversity of birds, the area is also a wintering area for numerous species&#13;
from North America. Both of the surviving land mammals of Hispaniola are found in the&#13;
Macaya area. The La Visite area, containing hardwood forest on the steep slopes and pine&#13;
forest on the central plateau, has over 308 species of vascular plants, including 90 species&#13;
(29 percent) endemic to Hispaniola and 36 (11 percent) endemic to the Massif de la Selle.&#13;
In addition, over 20 species of butterflies, 45 species of land mollusks, at least 12 species&#13;
of amphibians, and 67 species of birds are reported in the area of the proposed park. Of&#13;
the 21 endemic bird species on Hispaniola, 17 (81 percent) are found inside the park area.&#13;
5.3    Recreational/tourist benefits. The parks and forest have considerable potential&#13;
for recreational use by Haitians and for attracting foreign tourists, especially in light of the&#13;
growing interest in eco-tourism worldwide. At present, there is no significant tourism in&#13;
either the La Visite or the Pic Macaya National Parks. But, based on the experience of&#13;
other countries in the region, notably Costa Rica, it is not unreasonable to expect that the&#13;
Pic Macaya National Park might attract several thousand tourists a year, as long as its&#13;
cloud forest habitat and its rich avifauna are preserved (the avifauna is probably&#13;
particularly important from a marketing viewpoint, since the town of Cayes is the&#13;
birthplace of ornithologist John Audubon). Revenue from modest entrance fees alone&#13;
would be sufficient to cover between 10 to 40 percent of the parks' recurrent costs.&#13;
5.4   The major economic benefits would be derived from the attraction of additional&#13;
tourism, leading to longer stays and higher per tourist expenditures. The experience of&#13;
Costa Rica suggests that both effects are likely to be significant. In Costa Rica, where&#13;
eco-tourism has been aggressively marketed, it is estimated that there are over 300,000&#13;
eco-tourists annually, each spending on average per visit more than US$1,000.&#13;
Conservatively, if earnings per tourist in Haiti were half the level observed in Costa Rica,&#13;
the present value of the resulting income stream would reach US$15.0 million. However,&#13;
since realizing this potential would require additional investments in roads, these benefits&#13;
are not considered in the economic analysis for this project.&#13;
5.5    Harvesting offorest products. While no cutting would be carried out in the&#13;
national parks, in the multi-purpose national forest reserve of Foret des Pins, the project&#13;
envisages thinning operations and Christmas tree production. No commercial logging&#13;
would be carried out during the life of the project. Thinning would generate wood&#13;
products with an approximate financial value of US$20,000 annually, while Christmas tree&#13;
production would, after eight years, generate about US$14,000 annually. The benefits&#13;
from these activities would be distributed to local communities. The present value of&#13;
these income streams is about US$0.3 million. In the longer term, after the forest&#13;
management plans have been developed, some parts of the forest might be zoned for&#13;
sustainable commercial forestry. Many products are currently harvested from the project&#13;
areas, including fuel wood, fodder (both by collection and by direct grazing of animals),&#13;
bwa gra (resinous sticks used to Lght charcoal fires), fruit, and various herbs for medicinal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
or aromatic purposes. The project would assess which of these activities could be&#13;
continued on a sustainable basis.&#13;
5.6    Off-site benefits. The off-site benefits would be directed to the rural communities&#13;
living in the downstream areas. These benefits would stem from an improvement in&#13;
efficiency of existing irrigation systems, lower irrigation O&amp;M costs, and a mitigation of&#13;
farm losses due to flood damage. The three protected areas are near the summits of&#13;
mountain ranges: the Pic Macaya on the Massif de la Hotte and La Visite and Foret des&#13;
Pins on the Massif de la Selle. Deforestation in these mountainous areas has already&#13;
caused considerable downstream damage resulting both from erosion and changes in local&#13;
hydrology. Sedimentation is causing considerable damage to irrigation capacity by silting&#13;
diversion dams and distribution canals. This problem is particularly marked in the Plaine&#13;
des Cayes, an important agricultural area downstream of the Pic Macaya National Park.&#13;
The heavy sediment loads of rivers originating in the project areas frequently result in&#13;
flooding and river course changes, both of which cause substantial damage to agriculture,&#13;
urban areas, and roads. In addition, increased run-off resulting from deforestation in the&#13;
upper reaches of the watersheds is increasing the incidence of flooding during the wet&#13;
season and water scarcities for both irrigation and domestic use during the dry season.&#13;
5.7    Greater irrigation efficiency. Estimated off-site benefits include those derived&#13;
from containment and/or reduction of the damage to irrigation systems. In the Macaya&#13;
area, under the without project scenario, it was assumed that, due to deterioration of the&#13;
irrigation systems, 5 percent of the irrigated area would be abandoned annually'. This was&#13;
compared against two project scenarios: one, in which the irrigated area would remain&#13;
constant; and the other, in which the irrigated area would be increased 1.25 percent&#13;
annually. On the basis of these conservative assumptions, the present value of the benefits&#13;
from reduced damage to irrigation resulting from project interventions would be about&#13;
US$4.0 million to US$20 million. These benefits refer only to those related to gains in&#13;
agricultural production and do not include those benefits related to reduced O&amp;M costs.&#13;
5.8 Reduction in flood related damages. Areas downstream from the project sites&#13;
are subject to frequent flooding, causing loss of standing crops and damage to&#13;
infrastructure, including roads, irrigation canals, and houses. Floodings, which had been&#13;
relatively infrequent (occurring once every four to five years), now occur regularly twice a&#13;
year, effecting an increasingly larger area. The floodings in Camp-Perrin of June 1986,&#13;
one of the few floods for which there are historical records, was estimated to have caused&#13;
over US$1.0 million in damages to the embankments at Camp-Perrin and Cayes,&#13;
agricultural production, and buildings and other infrastructure.&#13;
5.9   The estimated cost of flood related damages is limited only to those costs related&#13;
to damages to infrastructure. An estimation of the cost of flood related crop damages was&#13;
not made as the actual damages depend upon many unknown factors including the type&#13;
and the intensity of the crops involved, as well as the depth and duration of the flooding.&#13;
5     Based on available historical records for the Avezac, Dubreuil and Torbeck irrigation systems in&#13;
the Plaine des Cayes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27 -&#13;
Therefore, this very conservative estimate of flood damage to infrastructure is about&#13;
US$0.5 million annually, having a present value of about US$2.5 million. In addition, it&#13;
would be reasonable to assume that, in the absence of the project, continued natural&#13;
degradation would increase flooding intensity and frequency and that the costs of the&#13;
associated damages could double. Assuming that such averted damages are reduced by&#13;
only by 25 percent over five years, the present value of these losses would be about&#13;
US$1.0 million. This, in addition to the benefits stemming from the containment of&#13;
damages, would yield a benefit with a present value between US$3.5 million and&#13;
US$6.0 million.&#13;
5.10  Additional benefits. Although not considered in the economic analysis, there are&#13;
additional benefits, related to hydroelectric power (HEP) and transportation facilities,&#13;
would stem from this component. Haiti has an acute power shortage, developing its HEP&#13;
potential will not be possible unless upstream degradation is substantially reduced. Some&#13;
of the planned buffer zone activities in the Pic Macaya area could help protect the&#13;
Cavaillon river watershed above the Saut Mathurine hydroelectric power (HEP) plant,&#13;
whose reservoir is being rapidly silted up. The Saut-Mathurine HEP plant has an installed&#13;
production capacity of 2.4MW. Other downstream benefits of arrested or reduced natural&#13;
resource degradation in the project include decreased silting in the port of Cayes, increase&#13;
in fish stocks and control of the intrusion of saltwater into coastal aquifers.&#13;
5.11   Component Costs6. The estimated present value of cost of this component,&#13;
including investment, recurrent and opportunity costs in foregone income, would be&#13;
US$6.0 million. Certain economic activities are expected to be curtailed as a result of&#13;
better park and reserve management, particularly some agricultural and logging activities.&#13;
Based on the farm models, the present value of foregone income resulting from the&#13;
diversion of agricultural lands would be about US$2.1 million. The value of forgone&#13;
logging income could not be estimated as reliable data on standing timber volume and the&#13;
logging trade are not available. However, the degree of degradation of the remaining&#13;
forests with reasonable road access would indicate that the economic value of forgone&#13;
logging income is likely to be insignificant.&#13;
5.12  Conclusions. To gauge the economic viability of the component, the present&#13;
value of the component's economic costs was compared against the present value of its&#13;
calculable benefits. The present value of the aggregated component costs, including&#13;
investment, recurrent and opportunity costs, of US$6.0 million was compared against the&#13;
present value of the quantified benefits. These benefits included: (i) increased efficiency&#13;
of existing irrigation systems, yielding an estimated present value of benefits of between&#13;
US$4.0 million and US$20 million; and (ii) the mitigation of flood related-damages,&#13;
resulting in an estimated present value of benefits of between US$3.5 million and&#13;
US$6.0 million. Combined present value of these benefits would range between&#13;
US$7.5 million to US$26 million.&#13;
All costs and benefits are expressed in present values, applying a 10 percent discount rate and, in&#13;
most cases, an infinite time horizon.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
5.13  This exercise underestimates the expected economic benefits because:&#13;
(i) conservative assumptions were applied; and (ii) more importantly, the more substantial&#13;
benefits, such as the conservation of the biodiversity and the potential for tourism, were&#13;
not included. Nevertheless, even the benefits at the lower end of this conservative range&#13;
are sufficient to justify the project investments, and the present value of the benefits at the&#13;
upper end of the range significantly exceed the present value of the total costs.&#13;
Buffer Zone Development Component&#13;
5.14  The Buffer Zone Development Component would support Technology Generation&#13;
and Transfer activities and the Buffer Zone Development Facility. The Technology&#13;
Generation and Transfer activities would benefit over 7,400 farm households by increasing&#13;
agricultural productivity and income. Project-supported extension would introduce and&#13;
promote boundary tree planting to about 4,700 households, soil conservation methods to&#13;
approximately 2,000 households, and the adoption of appropriate farm technologies to&#13;
about 740 households. Farm model analysis indicated that the net marginal household&#13;
income gain would be about 23 percent from boundary tree plantings; 39 percent from the&#13;
application of soil conservation practices; and 60 percent from the adoption of appropriate&#13;
agricultural technologies. These interventions would increase average farm income by an&#13;
estimated US$475. Over a ten year time horizon, the internal rate of return (IRR) of these&#13;
activities would be 9 percent with a 50 percent beneficiary coverage, 27 percent with a&#13;
75 percent coverage and 41 percent with a 100 percent coverage.&#13;
5.15  In addition to these financial benefits, project-supported agricultural extension&#13;
services would provide significant economic benefits by introducing natural resource&#13;
management practices essential to arresting environmental degradation and increasing&#13;
productivity. By increasing rural household income, the project would relieve the need for&#13;
rural households to encroach in the protected areas.&#13;
5.16 Of the US$2.7 million allocated for the BZSIF, US$1.6 million would fund&#13;
income-generating activities, US$0.8 million would finance conservation grants and&#13;
0.3 million would support technology generating activities. The beneficiary&#13;
demand-driven income-generating activities are expected to benefit more than 18,000 rural&#13;
households. Based on rural household surveys, these investments would likely include&#13;
grain storage, agricultural marketing and processing. The Facility would increase rural&#13;
household's incomes and diversify their income sources. According to farm model&#13;
analysis, the estimated additional income to be derived from typical investments would be&#13;
US$50 per household. Table I presents typical income-generating investments to be&#13;
financed by the Facility, with the expected household income increment attributable to the&#13;
investment.&#13;

5.17  Beneficiary demand driven financing facilities need time to "start-up" - time to&#13;
introduce potential beneficiaries to the procedures for accessing the Facility. Therefore,&#13;
projected disbursements for Facility -supported income-generating activities would be&#13;
13 percent for the first two years of project implementation. In each of the remaining&#13;
project years, expected disbursements for these activities would increase considerably,&#13;
averaging 30 percent annually. For this reason, the IRR of these activities would be&#13;
18 percent over a five year time horizon, and increase to an estimated 79 percent over a&#13;
ten year time horizon.&#13;
B. Environmental Aspects&#13;
5.18   The project has been approved as Environmental Assessment Category "B."&#13;
It would have a positive impact on the protection of the protected areas and the&#13;
conservation of soil and forest resources in the surrounding areas. It will establish a Park&#13;
Service that will be able to identify and protect new reserves in the future, especially those&#13;
that are currently not well represented and it would identify financial mechanisms to&#13;
ensure adequate habitat protection in the future. Development activities in the buffer&#13;
zones would be carefully designed and monitored so as to not encourage in-migration.&#13;
The Buffer Zone Small Investment Facility would only finance those projects that passed&#13;
an environmental screening process, and no project would be considered that would be&#13;
likely to enhance the possibility of encroachment.&#13;
5.19  More specifically, the environmental impact of the project would be to: (a) reduce&#13;
natural resource degradation, in particular the decline in soil productivity, loss of land&#13;
suitable for agriculture and forestry, and water retention; (b) maintain the habitat for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
unique forest ecosystems with rare or endangered species of flora and fauna, and for&#13;
human settlement; and (c) generate additional production on a sustained basis (fuelwood,&#13;
poles, fruits, food crops and fodder. Aside from some thinning operations in the Pine&#13;
Forest to enhance growth of the existing stands, no logging would be undertaken during&#13;
the implementation period of the project. Existing roads in the Pine Forest would be&#13;
maintained. Road access to the La Visite Park would be improved, but only through an&#13;
indirect route from the South, which because of its distance from Port-au-Prince would&#13;
not attract illegal logging.&#13;
C. Sustainability&#13;
5.20  Evaluations of investments in protected areas indicate that there are two common&#13;
constraints to achieving sustained impacts: insecure and insufficient financing, and&#13;
inadequate management. This project will provide adequate funding during the life of the&#13;
project and make concerted efforts towards establishing the Park (SPNS) and Forest&#13;
Resources (SRF) Services as efficient, well structured organizations that have the capacity&#13;
to plan, coordinate and evaluate technical operations. During the life of the project,&#13;
options for a sustainable financing mechanism will be explored to assure long-term funding&#13;
for recurrent protection costs, as well as incremental costs for complementary&#13;
conservation/sustainable use activities. Recommendations from this analysis could&#13;
constitute the basis for a future request to the GEF. The project will also support the&#13;
Government's recommendation to eventually establish an autonomous government agency&#13;
whose function would be to manage national protected areas. The autonomous structure&#13;
is advantageous for a number of reasons: (i) autonomous agencies have greater political&#13;
autonomy and programmatic flexibility than Ministerial Services; (ii) such agencies are&#13;
able to raise private funds and sign contracts with other agencies; and thus (iii) the&#13;
autonomous structure would enhance the Park Service's ability to attract private funds&#13;
and liase with civic organizations.&#13;
5.21   The issues of inadequate reserve management and sustained encroachment will be&#13;
addressed by providing income generating options for the poor in reserve buffer areas, and&#13;
by establishing representative and transparent Advisory Committees that are empowered&#13;
to assure local voice in reserve management decision, and equitable distribution of tangible&#13;
benefits from the reserves. In order to enhance the probability of sustaining the benefits&#13;
and behaviors generated by the household energy component, it will build on and improve&#13;
existing institutions, products and markets, rather than create new structures.&#13;
Interventions will be carefully designed so that all participants will be able to either earn&#13;
more money or save on fuel expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31 -&#13;
D. Risks&#13;
5.22  The main risks of the project relate to: (i) uncertain political stability which may&#13;
impact on continued Government commitment to its declared development strategy,&#13;
project funding, and efficient management and functioning of the implementing agencies;&#13;
(ii) weak coordination and management capacity of central and local government and&#13;
private agencies to implement the project; and (iii) the "success" of buffer zones&#13;
development activities that could attract in-migration. To minimize the risks, the project's&#13;
objectives and scale of operations have been kept in line with the institutional reality;&#13;
management services contracts would be used with clear TORs, implementation schedules&#13;
and targets; activities in the buffer zones would be designed with and by the current local&#13;
residents to target current local residents; annual work programs and budgets would be&#13;
approved by IDA; and a mid-term review of the performance of the project would be used&#13;
to: (i) assess progress made on a technical point of view and to reach a long-term&#13;
financing mechanism for sustainable forest and parks management; (ii) recommend&#13;
adequate corrective measures; and (iii) redesign the project if required.&#13;
6. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
6.1    During negotiations, the Government agreed to carry out key actions detailed in&#13;
the implementation plan attached to the Project's Credit Agreement as a supplemental&#13;
letter. Other major agreements and assurances obtained during negotiations include that:&#13;
(i) the PCU would maintain adequate staff and/or recruit consultants with qualifications&#13;
and experience satisfactory to IDA to carry out the project; (ii) competitive-based&#13;
contracts with private organizations and agreements with public agencies to provide&#13;
technical and management expertise would be on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA,&#13;
(iii) the implementation of the project would be on the basis of annual work programs and&#13;
budgets which would be acceptable to IDA; (iv) semi-annual progress reports would be&#13;
sent to IDA for review; (v) the carrying out of a mid-term evaluation of the project not&#13;
later than February 28, 1999, the results of which would provide the basis for necessary&#13;
adjustments in project design and funding allocation, as well as for ensuring a long-term&#13;
financing mechanism for forest and parks protection; (vi) in the event that the Government&#13;
chooses to relocate landholders from within Park boundaries, it would prepare a&#13;
resettlement plan in accordance to Bank guidelines prior to undertaking resettlement; and&#13;
(vii) a Special Event of Default, namely that any changes to the MDE Organic Law or the&#13;
Operational Manual that would materially and adversely affect the project, will constitute&#13;
an event of suspension of the credit.&#13;
6.2   Conditions of Effectiveness of the proposed credit would be that: (i) the PCU had&#13;
been established within MDE and the project coordinator appointed; (ii) the project&#13;
Operational Manual with terms and conditions acceptable to IDA had been adopted;&#13;
(iii) an interministerial arrangement had been signed between MDE and MARNDR&#13;
describing the technical responsibilities of MARNDR relevant entities, namely SRF,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
SPNS, CRDA, and DFPC; and (iv) a Procurement Agent had been contracted with terms&#13;
and conditions acceptable to IDA.&#13;
6.3   Recommendation.  Subject to the above agreements and conditions, the&#13;
proposed project would constitute a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of SDR 15 million&#13;
(US$21.5 million equivalent) to the Republic of Haiti, repayable in 40 years, on standard&#13;
IDA terms.&#13;

ANNEX E&#13;
HAITI&#13;
FOREST AND PARKS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
Buffer Zone Small Investment Facility: Eligibility Principles&#13;
1.     Poverty Targeting: Buffer Zone Small Investment Facility (BZSIF) sub-projects will benefit the poor.&#13;
The types of eligible sub-projects will help ensure high coverage of poor people.&#13;
2.     Benericiary Participation: Sub-projects will be identified, designed and executed by beneficiary-groups&#13;
proposing the sub-projects.&#13;
3.     Bencficiary Cost-Sharing: The beneficiary group will be required to make a counterpart contribution,&#13;
either in cash or kind, towards financing of the project. This contribution will be no less than 20 percent of the&#13;
total cost of the project.&#13;
4.     Eligibility Criteria: The BZSIF will finance three categories of sub-projects within the buffer zones of&#13;
the project areas: (a) small income generation projects; (b) applied agricultural research; and (c) conservation of&#13;
public natural resources. Individuals may not propose projects and projects for individual benefit will not be&#13;
considered. The first category would include activities such as grain storage, agricultural transformation, input&#13;
retailing, credit, soil conservation, agroforestry, technical assistance or training. The second category would&#13;
include activities such as on-farm trials and testing techniques for transforming agricultural products. Peasant&#13;
membership organizations from within the buffer zones with a history of collective action will be eligible for&#13;
categories (a) and (b). The third category would include activities that generate or protect community-level public,&#13;
natural resources, such as soil conservation to protect public ravines, ecotourism development, and study tours,&#13;
technical assistance or training related to such activities. Local governments - at the Rural Section and Commune&#13;
level - %vithin the buffer zones will be eligible to submit proposals for category (b) Projects in category (c) would&#13;
conform to a local development plan approved by the Ministry of Environment.&#13;
5.     Project Sponsorship: The BZSIF will not sponsor projects. It will respond to the demand for projects.&#13;
The BZSIF will provide technical assistance to beneficiary groups to assist them in identifying and articulating&#13;
their project proposals.&#13;
6.     Project Implementation: The BZSIF will not implement the projects on its own, nor will it employ the&#13;
services of local contractors to implement the projects. The projects will be implemented by the beneficiary-group,&#13;
who - where appropriate - will employ the services of sub-contractors to assist in implementing the projects. These&#13;
sub-contractors would be chosen on a competitive basis and approved by the BZSIF.&#13;
7.     Sustainability: The BZSIF will not provide resources to supplement recurrent expenditures. BZSIF&#13;
support will be conditional upon confirmation that resources (private and public) will be made available to meet&#13;
recurrent expenditures.&#13;
8.     Complementarity: The BZSIF will collaborate with the Ministry of Environment, the Forest Resources&#13;
Service of the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development (MARNDR), and the National&#13;
Parks and Natural Sites Service (MARNDR) to ensure complementarity of objectives.&#13;
9.     Project Size: Any sub-project exceeding US$50,000 will require the non-objection of the Bank.&#13;
10.    Project Costs and Benefits: Projects will employ least cost designs and deliver maximum benefits for a&#13;
given cost. Projects will be appraised according to standard methods of measuring costs and benefits.&#13;

            Haiti - Forest and Parks Protection
            Technical Assistance Project

        <abstracts>
            The overall objective of the Forest and
            Parks Protection Technical Assistance Project is to start
            the initial phase of intervention for the protection of
            critical remnants of Haiti's forest ecosystems and for
            slowing the pace of degradation of Haiti's forest
            resouces. The three specific objectives of the project are
            to: a) provide institutional support to the Ministry of
            Environment and related services within the Ministry of
            Agriculture, of Natural Resources and of Rural Development
            for strengthening the Government's isntitutional forest
            and parks protection system; b) initiate key activities to
            protect and manage specific parks; and c) reduce pressure on
            protected areas by increasing on-farm productivity and
            off-farm employment options conserving natural resources,
            and enhancing the management capacity of local
            organizations. The project will achieve its objectives by
            financing technical assistance, technical and policy
            studies, training, equipment, limited civil works, and
            incremental operating costs required to implement the
            following components: a) institutional strengthening and
            reform; b) support for the management of forest and national
            parks; and c) suport for the buffer zone development
