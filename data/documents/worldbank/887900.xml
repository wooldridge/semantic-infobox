ABSTRACT&#13;
The paper analyzes the contribution of agriculture to economic&#13;
growth.   By employing cross-section data for the developing and developed&#13;
countries during 1960-1970 and 1970-1979, it is found that in the context of&#13;
Mr. Chenery-Syrquin's model intercountry variation in agricultural growth&#13;
explains a significant portion of intercountry variation in the industrial&#13;
(non-agricultural) growth. Further, in the context of an aggregate production&#13;
function  agricultural  growth  is  found  to  contribute  significantly  to&#13;
productivity  increases  and  thus  to  overall  economic  growth.    For  the&#13;
developing countries sample of the 1970-1979 period, the results show that a&#13;
one percent increase in agricultural growth leads to approximately four-tenths&#13;
of a percentage point increase in productivity.  It is also found that export&#13;
growth contributes positively to productivity growth while the inflation rate&#13;
contributes negatively.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
Despite the dominant position occupied by the agricultural sector in&#13;
a traditional economy, many parts of the developing world have continuously&#13;
denied agricultural and rural development adequate attention. This has often&#13;
led to a stagnant agriculture that, in turn, has resulted in large shortfalls&#13;
of domestic food production, balance of payment crises, and political&#13;
instability.1/    For  a  primitive  agrarian  economy,  it  is  doubtful  that&#13;
industrialization can succeed without the prior or concurrent emergence of a&#13;
productive agricultural sector.&#13;
This paper undertakes a statistical analysis of the significance of&#13;
the contribution of agriculture to economic growth by the use of cross section&#13;
data. The major conclusion of the analysis is that agricultural growth is a&#13;
significant determinant of both industrial and overall economic growth.  The&#13;
empirical evidence thus reinforces the argument that agriculture and rural&#13;
development should be given priority and be properly supported in an overall&#13;
development strategy.  The paper also shows that the rate of growth of export&#13;
is positively correlated with the rate of economic growth. The inflation rate&#13;
rate, however, has a negative correlation.&#13;

The paper contains three main sections.   Section II analyzes the&#13;
relationship   between  agriculture  and  industry  during  the  development&#13;
process.   Section III examines the contribution of agriculture to economic&#13;
growth in the framework of a production function. The summary and conclusions&#13;
are given in the last section.&#13;
II. The Relationship Between Agriculture and Industrial Growth&#13;
The   transition  from  a  traditional  agrarian  economy  to  an&#13;
industrialized economy is a dynamic process that inevitably involves complex&#13;
interactions among many economic as well as social factors.   The role of&#13;
agriculture in the transitional process varies from country to country,&#13;
conditioned   by  factor  endowment,   institutional  arrangements,   cultural&#13;
background,  historical factors, policy choices, etc.   Nevertheless, drawing&#13;
from the experience of both developing and developed countries, one can&#13;
identify several important roles played by agriculture in the transition&#13;
process  [e.g. Johnston and Mellor (1961), Johnston and Kilby (1975)]:   (1)&#13;
agriculture generates markets for industrial products, especially light&#13;
industrial products which have ready markets in the agricultural sector; (2)&#13;
agriculture provides food and agricultural raw materials for industrial&#13;
processing; (3) agriculture builds adequate food supplies which are a crucial&#13;
factor in sustaining price stability; (4) agriculture provides exports to earn&#13;
foreign exchangie; (5) agriculture supplies the non-agricultural sector with&#13;
capital and labor; and (6) in the case of a market-oriented agriculture,&#13;
through   the   gradual   accumulation   of   entrepreneurship   and   marketing&#13;
capabilities   in   the   agricultural   sector,   eases   the   process   of&#13;
industrialization. In sum, the agricultural sector supports industrialization&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
by providing a source of labor, capital and raw materials to the non-&#13;
agriculture sector and by generating demand for industrial products.&#13;
The relationship between agriculture and industry may be one of&#13;
interdependence and complementarity.   For example, while providing inputs to&#13;
industry, agriculture receives from Industry modern farm inputs, advanced&#13;
technologies, and consumption goods to increase agricultural productivity.&#13;
The statistical significance of this relationship may be tested by the&#13;
following non-linear model of the Chenery-Syrquin (1975) type which relates&#13;
the rate of industrial growth  (I) to per capita income (YN) and to the rate&#13;
of agricultural growth (A):&#13;
I  =  f (A,lnYN, (lnYN)2) + u,                                (1)&#13;
where u is a randomly distributed error term.&#13;
The model is derived in the following way.  First, assume that the&#13;
rate of growth of industry and of agriculture are both non-linear functions of&#13;
per capita income variables:&#13;
I  =  a  ln YN +    (lnYN)  + c                               (2)&#13;
and&#13;
A  =  aA InYN + A(lnYN)  +eA,                                 (3)&#13;
where  eI and eA are random errors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
These are simplified reduced form models for the determination of&#13;
industrial and agricultural growth. The per capita income variables are used&#13;
as a summary measure of the stage of economic development in addition to being&#13;
a measure of final demand. Chenery and Taylor (1968) have used similar models&#13;
to study patterns of economic development.  Alternatively, these regressions&#13;
can be thought: of as establishing "norms" for the rates of growth of industry&#13;
and agriculture with reference to the stage of economic development as&#13;
measured by the level of per capita income.   It is possible to test the&#13;
hypothesis of whether countries with higher industrial growth in relation to&#13;
the "normal" industrial growth also are those with higher agricultural growth&#13;
with reference to its norm.   This can be done by regressing the residuals in&#13;
equation (2) on the residuals in equation (3).&#13;
S I = ye A+ u, y&gt;o,                                          (4)&#13;
where u is a randomly distributed error term.&#13;
Substituting (2) and (3) into (4) and rearranging terms yield&#13;
. +                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~2&#13;
I = Y    (a    ya) lnYN - (y   - 8) (InYN)  + u *            (5)&#13;
This is the explicit form of equation 1.  This equation also implies that the&#13;
disparity between industrial and agricultural growth,   I - A,   is a second&#13;
order non-linear function of per capita income.&#13;
The estimation of equation (5) is based on two cross-country&#13;
samples:   one consists of 63 countries for the decade of the 1960s and the&#13;
other has 87 countries for the decade of the 1970s.   Both samples include&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
developing as well as developed countries.  The data sources are provided in&#13;

The notations have the following meanings:&#13;
I   -    the average annual rate of growth of industry  that comprises&#13;
mining, manufacturing, construction, and electricity, water and&#13;
gas.&#13;
YN =     GNP per capita in 1970 and 1979, respectively, for the 1960-70&#13;
sample and the 1970-79 sample.&#13;
A  =     the average annual rate of growth of agriculture.&#13;
First, note that the regressions with the per capita income&#13;
variables alone (equations 1 and 2) depict a parabolic curve, indicating that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
at a relative low income level industrial growth will increase as per capita&#13;
income increases and when per capita income reaches a certain level, the rate&#13;
of industrial growth will reach a maximum and then taper off.&#13;
The tihird and fourth equations show that the growth rate of&#13;
agriculture is a statistically significant variable in explaining industrial&#13;
growth and it has the power to raise the R2 significantly, especially for the&#13;
1970-79 sample.   The introduction of the agriculture variable does not alter&#13;
the signs of the per capita income variables but does reduce their statistical&#13;
significance.   The estimated regressions indicate that the disparity between&#13;
industrial and agricultural growth is a second-order non-linear function in&#13;
per capita income.   Based on the 1970-79 cross section data of 87 countries,&#13;
this disparity  is illustrated  in Table  2 for a selected number of income&#13;
levels.  As the itable shows, the expected value of the disparity rises quickly&#13;
over the low- an&lt;l middle-income range (US $100 to US $1,500) and slowly tapers&#13;
off after the middle income range.&#13;
The empirical evidence thus indicates that over the course of&#13;
economic  development,  agricultural  growth  is a significant  determinant  of&#13;
industrial growth.  As reasoned earlier, the relationship between agriculture&#13;
and industry, however, is more likely to be interdependent rather than causal.&#13;

III. Agriculture and Overall Economic Growth - A Production Function Approach&#13;
The empirical evidence presented in the previous section suggests&#13;
that the linkage between agriculture and industry may be strong and&#13;
significant during economic development.   In this section I will examine the&#13;
contribution of agriculture to economic growth from the perspective of an&#13;
aggregate production function.  The hypothesis formulated and tested here is&#13;
that agriculture contributes to economic growth through its impact on the rate&#13;
of increase in productivity.&#13;
There are at least two reasons why agricultural performance is&#13;
closely  related  to  the  overall  productivity  of  an  economy.          First,&#13;
industrialization and the accompanied urbanization generate a growing need for&#13;
food and raw materials, which can only be met with adequate agricultural&#13;
supplies. A poorly performed agricultural sector often results in a terms of&#13;
trade that is against industry, in a loss of foreign exchange, or in an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
inadequate demand for industrial output that restricts industrial expansion.&#13;
These conditions would hamper the transfer of resources from agriculture to&#13;
industry  or  make  it  very  costly  to  do  so.    On  the  other  hand,  rapid&#13;
agricultural  growth  makes  feasible  more  per  capita  domestic  consumption,&#13;
higher  exports   of  agricultural   products,   and  greater   absorption   of&#13;
agricultural  labor  force  by  the industrial  sector.   It would,  therefore,&#13;
increase the efficiency of the resource transfers.   As Robinson (1971) has&#13;
shown, transfers of capital and labour from a low productivity sector&#13;
(agriculture) to a high productivity sector (manufacturing) could be a source&#13;
of economic growth.&#13;
Second, high agricultural growth largely reflects high average labor&#13;
productivity in agriculture which, in turn, is supported by the high quality&#13;
of human resources and physical capital inputs into the rural sector.   For&#13;
instance,   comparing   the  agricultural  productivity  differences   between&#13;
developing and developed countris, Hayami and Ruttan (1970) have found that&#13;
about two-thirds of the differences can be accounted for by the difference in&#13;
technology, as embodied in fixed working capital and in human capital, broadly&#13;
conceived to include the education, skills, knowledge and capacity present in&#13;
a country-s population.   These considerations suggest the inclusion of the&#13;
rate of agriculitural growth as an additional variable in an aggregate&#13;
production function to measure both the effect of the efficiency of resource&#13;
transfers between agriculture and industry and of the changes of agricultural&#13;
productivity on economic growth.&#13;
Other Variables Affecting Productivity Change&#13;
It might be useful to consider other variables that might influence&#13;
productivity changes to minimize misspecification of the production function&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
to be estimated below.   Here, I will consider two variables -  the rate of&#13;
exports growth and the rate of inflation.2!&#13;
The contribution of the former to economic growth is usually&#13;
rationalized on such grounds as: (1) exports provide for the economy of scale&#13;
operations, and (2) higher export growth enhances competition which is brought&#13;
from  international  markets.    These  factors  would  promote  efficiency  and&#13;
therefore  raise  economic  growth.   The positive correlation between export&#13;
growth rates and GNP growth rates for the LDCs has been found in a number of&#13;
studies, i.e., Michalopoulos and Tay (1973), Michaely (1977), and Krueger&#13;
(1977). Recently, in the context of an aggregate production function, Balassa&#13;
(1978), Tyler (1981) and Feder (1982) have all found that the growth in&#13;
exports contributes significantly to the intercountry differences in the rates&#13;
of economic growth.  These studies differed from earlier ones in that besides&#13;
exports, they had simultaneously considered the contributions made by factor&#13;
inputs, i.e., by capital and labor.   They are, therefore, able to delineate&#13;
more robustly the effects of exports on economic growth.&#13;
The rate of inflation, however, affects economic growth negatively&#13;
for  at  least  the  following reasons  (Tsiang,  1983).   First,  inflation by&#13;
increasing the variance of relative prices may make efficient planning of&#13;
production difficult and as a result productivity suffers.  Second, inflation&#13;
accompanied by government controls would lead to very low real interest&#13;
rates.   This would lead to a false sense of cheapness of capital and to&#13;
unproductive uses of such capital. Thirdly, below equilibrium interest rates&#13;
accompanied by high inflation would turn the flow of savings away from&#13;
1/   Exports and inflation, however, are not the only factors that influence&#13;
productivity.   Education could be another factor but is omitted here&#13;
(Selowsky, 1969).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
financial institutions and force them into unproductive investments such as&#13;
hoardings of previous metals and investments on housing.&#13;
The Model&#13;
To test the hypothesis formulated above, I will use the following&#13;
Cobb-Douglas production function:&#13;
Y = C KaLoelog R                                             (6)&#13;
where Y is gross domestic product; C is a scale parameter; K is capital stock,&#13;
L is labor force; elog R indicates the rate of technological change over time&#13;
which is taken l:o be synonymous with productivity change.&#13;
Rewriting the variables in equation (6) in terms of the rate of&#13;
change over time yields&#13;
Y = aK + SL + R.                                             (7)&#13;
In the literature of production function analysis the productivity&#13;
change (R) in  the  production  function  (7)  is  frequently  treated  as  a&#13;
"residual" and the production function is estimated accordingly.  The argument&#13;
presented here assumes that the rate of productivity change will be positively&#13;
influenced by both the rates of agricultural growth  (A) and export growth&#13;
(X) but negatively related to the rate of inflation  (P)&#13;
R = yA + OX + nP + c, Y, 0 &gt;0, n&lt;O,                          (8)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
where e is a residual, assumed to be randomly distributed.  Combining (7) and&#13;
(8) yields&#13;
Y = aK + $L + yA + OX + nP + c                               (9)&#13;
where    Y =  the average annual rate of growth in GDP&#13;
K = the average annual rate of growth in capital, proxied&#13;
by the average investment rate&#13;
L     the average annual rate of growth in labor force&#13;
L  =  the average annual rate of growth in exports&#13;
P  =  the average annual rate of inflation&#13;
Since agriculture is a part of total output, to test whether&#13;
agricultural growth contributes significantly to productivity increases, we&#13;
first regress the part of economic growth that cannot be explained by growth&#13;
in factor inputs (capital and labor) and factors influencing the productivity&#13;
change (export growth and inflation) on agricultural growth - that is, we&#13;
regress the unexplained residuals of the production function on agricultural&#13;
growth as the following:./&#13;
Y - aK -  L - OX - nP = yA + e,                             (10)&#13;
where  a, 8, A, and n are the estimates of  a, 8, 0 and n , respectively, when&#13;
agricultural growth (A) is omitted from equation (9).&#13;
1/   This should provide a robust test because, unlike total economic growth&#13;
itself, the residuals of the production function as indicated by the left&#13;
hand side of equation (10) need not bear any systematic relationship withi&#13;
agricultural growth, a priori.&#13;
&#13;

The hypothesis is tested with cross-country samples from two&#13;
periods:   1960--1970 and 1970-1979.  For the first period, the sample includes&#13;
56 countries of which 41 are developing countries (Table 3). For the second&#13;
period, because of the greater availability of country data, the sample is&#13;
increased to 81 countries   of which 68 are developing countries (Table 4).&#13;
For both time periods, empirical results are obtained for the developing&#13;
country sample as well as for the whole sample.&#13;
First, turn to the developing country sample results for the 1960-&#13;
1970 period, and note that capital and labor contribute to slightly less than&#13;
one third of the variations in total output (Table 5, equation 1).  When the&#13;
rate of export growth (X) and inflation (P) are added to the regression, this&#13;
increases the explained variations in total output from one third to slightly&#13;
less than one-half (equation 2) and reduces the labor elasticity from 1.6 to&#13;
1.2. All the variables are significant at above the 5 percent level, except&#13;
for the inflation rate.   The estimated coefficients obtained for the all-&#13;
country sample that includes the developed countries are very similar to those&#13;
obtained for the developing country sample -- compare equation 2 with equation&#13;
6, for example -- and they are more efficient as evidenced by higher t-values&#13;
which reflects a larger sample. Table 6 contains the empirical results of the&#13;
contribution of agricultural growth to the portion of economic growth that is&#13;
not explained by capital and labor inputs and by productivity changes due to&#13;
export growth and inflation.   It is shown that the marginal contribution of&#13;
agriculture to economic growth is statistically significant at above the one&#13;
percent level (equations   1 and 2).  It indicates that agricultural   growth&#13;
accounted for an additional 18 percent of the increase in total productivity&#13;
for  the   developing   countries  during  1960-70  and  16  percent  for  the&#13;
&#13;

Likewise, the empirical estimates obtained for the period 1970-1979&#13;
support the general patterns observed for the earlier period 1960-1970 (Table&#13;
7).  In addition, the estimates for 1970-79 are statistically more efficient&#13;
compared with the previous sample. For instance, the inflation rate is found&#13;
to be significant at above the five-percent significance level, even though&#13;
its negative impact on economic growth in absolute terms becomes smaller. The&#13;
estimated coefficients of export growth are nearly twice as large as those&#13;
obtained for the 1960-1970 sample, indicating that the marginal contribution&#13;
of  exports  to economic  growth appears  to be greater in the  1970s.   The&#13;
contribution of agriculture to the increase in productivity is again found to&#13;
be significant and accounts for 20 percent of the "unexplained" variations in&#13;
economic growth (Table 6, equations 3 and 4), which is somewhat higher than&#13;
the 18 percent estimated for the 1960-1970 period. A one percent increase in&#13;

agricultural growth is estimated to increase productivity by 0.35 percent&#13;
during the 197 0s.&#13;
When the rate of agricultural growth is introduced as an additional&#13;
variable in the production function in a multiple regression context, its&#13;
additional contribution to economic growth in terms of the R2s is reduced&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
because of multicollinearity. Furthermore, for the 1960-1970 period, there is&#13;
a significant correlation between agricultural growth and labor force growth,&#13;
so much so that the marginal contribution of agriculture to economic growth as&#13;
measured   by   the   coefficients   of   agricultural   growth   are   increased&#13;
significantly while those of labor force growth are correspondingly reduced.&#13;
For the developing country sample, the coefficient of agricultural growth is&#13;
increased from 0.40 (equation 1, Table 6) to 0.63 (equation 4, Table 5), while&#13;
that of labor force growth is reduced from 1.20 to 0.49 after the introduction&#13;
of agricultural growth  (A) .  But for the  1970-1979  period, however, the&#13;
regression coefficients remain largely the same (0.79 to 0.60) after the&#13;
addition of  A.  The estimated elasticity of agricultural growth is increased&#13;
only slightly from 0.35 to 0.38 for the developing country sample and shows&#13;
little  change  for  the  all  country  sample  (Table  7).   Thus  the marginal&#13;
contribution of agriculture to productivity growth can be more confidently&#13;
delineated from other influences during this period.  The estimated equation&#13;
for the developJing country sample is then used for a "sources" of economic&#13;
growth analysis discussed below.&#13;
Using the estimated regressions on economic growth, the average rate&#13;
of economic growth during a period can be decomposed according to the&#13;
"sources" of economic  growth.   To estimate the contributions made by each&#13;
source of growth, a constant term should be inserted into the equation, which&#13;
has so far been suppressed, in order to capture the composite effect on&#13;
productivity  changes  of all other factors omitted from the equation.   The&#13;
empirical evidence obtained here, however, does not suggest that the constant&#13;
term is statistically significant (compare equation 3 with equation 4 in Table&#13;
7,  for instance).   Thus  the effect of the excluded variables  -- such as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
education, health, and nutrition level of the work force, etc. -- on&#13;
productivity changes may have already been captured by the variables, i.e.,&#13;
exports,  agriculture,  and  inflation included  in the regression.   For the&#13;
developing countries sample of the 1970-1979 period, during which the average&#13;
rate of growth is 4.4 percent, the sources-of-growth decomposition indicates&#13;
that capital and labor jointly contribute to about 81 percent of the growth in&#13;
total output with the former contributing 48 percent and the latter 33&#13;
percent. The remaining 19 percent of the output growth is explained by the&#13;
productivity change which in turn is contributed by agricultural growth,&#13;
export growth, and inflation (Table 8)1/&#13;
It is worth noting that for the developing countries, the&#13;
contribution of agricultural growth to productivity growth (0.8 percent) is&#13;
greater than that of export growth (0.6 percent).  Agriculture's contributing&#13;
share in total productivity growth (17 percent) is also greater than that of&#13;
export growth (14 percent). Finally, one percentage increase in the inflation&#13;
rate is estimated to have reduced output growth by 0.4 percent due to its&#13;
detrimental effect on productivity growth.&#13;
1/ Since it is the property of the ordinary least squares method that the&#13;
average value of the dependent variable in the sample period is exactly&#13;
equal to the average of the predicted value of the dependent variable, the&#13;
sample average of the dependent variable can be exactly decomposed&#13;
according to the contributing variables included in the regression. As the&#13;
R2 indicates, the unexplained variation in the dependent variable is&#13;
large.    Therefore,  the  chances  are  high  that  some  variables  with&#13;
explanatory power might have been excluded.  Hence, this decomposition is&#13;
meaningful only insofar as it evaluates the relative contribution made by&#13;
each included explanatory variable.&#13;

IV.    Summary and Conclusion&#13;
Using cross section data of the 1960s and the 1970s, this paper has&#13;
shown that  intercountry variation in agricultural growth is a significant&#13;
determinant of intercountry variation in industrial  growth.   It has also&#13;
demonstrated  empirically  that  agricultural  growth  induces  productivity&#13;
increases and, therefore, facilitiates overall economic growth.  As argued in&#13;
the paper, this result may stem from the fact that rapid agricultural growth&#13;
raises the efficiency of resource (capital and labor) transfers between the&#13;
agricultural and the non-agricultural sectors resulting in an increase in&#13;
overall productivity.  Also rapid agricultural growth itself may reflect high&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
agricultural productivity.   The paper also confirms earlier findings on the&#13;
positive contribution of export growth to the increase of  productivity.  In&#13;
addition, it shows that inflation has the opposite effect on productivity.&#13;
The implication of the main thrust of this paper for the long term&#13;
development strategy of low income LDCs is clear: an appropriate agricultural&#13;
development strategy should be formulated to accelerate their agricultural&#13;
growth rates. While agriculture is inevitably a "declining industry" from the&#13;
point of view of its share in total output in the course of long-term&#13;
development, it should not be excessively squeezed for resources to support&#13;
non-agricultural activities and therefore prematurely "abandoned".&#13;
While cross section analysis serves to uncover the common variables&#13;
that determine the complex growth processes underlying individual countries&#13;
and to summarize their "average" or "normal" experience and thus a point of&#13;
reference for analyzing individual country performance, it should be&#13;
supplemented by detailed country studies to examine country specific&#13;
factors.   Given the often unique conditions surrounding developing country&#13;
agriculture, the examination of the contribution of agriculture to economic&#13;
growth through the use of cross section data as was done in this paper should&#13;
clearly not be exempted from these remarks.&#13;

reduced absolute poverty, It has been&#13;
necessary to consider other&#13;
strategies. The strategy examined In&#13;

            The contribution of agriculture to economic
            growth : some empirical evidence
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The paper analyzes the contribution of
            agriculture to economic growth. By employing cross-section
            data for the developing and developed countries during
            1960-1970 and 1970-1979, it is found that in the context of
            Mr. Chenery-Syrquin's model intercountry variation in
            agricultural growth explains a significant portion of
            intercountry variation in the industrial (non-agricultural)
            growth. Further, in the context of an aggregate production
            function agricultural growth is found to contribute
            significantly to productivity increases and thus to overall
            economic growth. For the developing countries sample of the
            1970-79 period, the results show that a one percent increase
            in agricultural growth leads to approximately four-tenths of
            a percentage point increase in productivity. It is also
            found that export growth contributes positively to
            productivity growth while the inflation rate contributes negatively.
