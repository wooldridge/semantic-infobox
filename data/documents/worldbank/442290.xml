POWER MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
1. THlE ENERGY SECTOR AND THE POWER SUBSECTOR&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.1   Colombia's prudent macroeconomic management enabled it to achieve one of the highest&#13;
and most stable growth rates in Latin America during the 1980s (3.7%). Solid economic growth&#13;
of about 4.5 percent per year for the past four decades, combined with a drop in the population&#13;
growth rate to 2.0 percent per year, have facilitated substantial improvement in social conditions.&#13;
1.2   The Government sought to further improve the economy's performance during the 1990s&#13;
through appropriate institutional reforms. In order to spur growth, the Barco administration&#13;
(1986-90) launched an economic reform program during the last year of its tenure which was&#13;
vigorously pursued during the Gaviria government years (1990-94). It involved opening trade,&#13;
exposing economic agents to competition and fostering private sector participation in areas where&#13;
the public sector traditionally prevailed (e.g. ports, railways, state-owned banking, state-&#13;
controlled industrial enterprises, the energy sector in general, and the power subsector in&#13;
particular). The Samper government's (1994-98) policies have emphasized socially-oriented&#13;
priorities, but it has continued to support the Gaviria-era structural reforms. Its major economic&#13;
challenge will consist of taking advantage (and avoiding the pitfalls) of the large foreign currency&#13;
revenues associated with massive increases in oil production which have the potential for putting&#13;
the economy (GDP per capita of US$1620) on a faster growth path with sustained GDP growth&#13;
of more than 5 percent per year.&#13;
B. The Energy Sector&#13;
1.3   Within the last decade the energy sector has become the single most important agent in the&#13;
Colombian economy. It has replaced coffee as the prime source of foreign exchange and will&#13;
continue to grow in importance during the next ten to fifteen years.&#13;
Energy Sector Organization&#13;
1.4   The energy sector has been characterized by the predominance of large public enterprises&#13;
in the power, coal, and hydrocarbon industries. Empresa Colombiana de Petroleos,&#13;
ECOPETROL, the state oil enterprise, has been responsible for oil and gas exploration, for&#13;
running the refineries and for importing oil products. In the coal subsector, Carbones de&#13;
Colombia, CARBOCOL owns, together with EXXON, the Cerrej6n coal mine and Empresa&#13;
Colombia de Carb6n, ECOCARBON is responsible for managing mining concessions and policy.&#13;
The power subsector is characterized by a more decentralized structure with a large number of&#13;
utilities which until recently were owned by the central or local governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
1.5   In the power subsector, a major reorganization has been taking place since 1991: a&#13;
competitive market at the generation level is being organized, an Energy Regulatory Commission&#13;
has been set up and Interconexi6n El6ctrica S.A., the major generation and transmission&#13;
enterprise, has been split into a transmission and dispatch enterprise which kept the name ISAI,&#13;
and a generation company (ISAGEN).&#13;
1.6   The energy sector is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME).&#13;
The Ministry is in charge of overall sector policy making; the independent Energy Regulatory&#13;
Commission is in charge of regulating prices for electricity and natural gas.&#13;
1.7   Other major government agencies involved in the energy sector are the National Planning&#13;
Department (DNP), the National Energy Finance Corporation (FEN) and the Ministry of Finance&#13;
(MHCP). The latter became the owner of a number of power plants together with substantial&#13;
equity in the sector's enterprises due to a financial restructuring operation which took place in&#13;
1991-92. It is now a major stockholder in the sector and it intends to divest its holdings which&#13;
amount to as much as 50% of the power sector's assets. DNP is in charge of approving major&#13;
publicly funded investments in the energy sector. FEN lends to companies in the energy sector.&#13;
It raises funds in the capital market and it also manages sector loans.&#13;
Energy Reserves and Consumption&#13;
1.8   Colombia has abundant energy resources: proven oil reserves are currently on the order of&#13;
3.2 billion barrels, equivalent to a Reserves/Production (R/P) ratio of around 20 years; proven&#13;
(8.3 trillion cubic feet ) and probable gas reserves amount to around 12.5 trillion cubic feet,&#13;
equivalent to a R/P ratio of about 70 years; coal reserves are estimated to be on the order of 2.2&#13;
billion tones (R/P in excess of 100 years); the hydroelectric potential is around 90 Gigawatt&#13;
(GW), of which less than i0% (about 8 GW) has been installed.&#13;
1.9   Final energy consumption in Colombia amounted to 244,00OTcal (17 IMBOE) in 1994,&#13;
which is equivalent to around 5BOE per capita. This amount is low when compared to the Latin&#13;
American average (around 8BOE) and is less than a quarter of the European per capita&#13;
consumption. The vigor exhibited by the increased energy production in the last decade, which&#13;
grew at 6% per year in the last decade, was not followed by a corresponding increase in&#13;
consumption. Between 1984 and 1994, intemal demand grew by less than 3% per year, slightly&#13;
belovA the rate of GDP growth. (See Annex 3 for details.)&#13;
Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement&#13;
1.10  The Bank has lent more than US$2 billion in 32 operations to support the Colombian&#13;
energy sector, mainly by financing investments in power generation and transmission. Bank&#13;
borrowers for power projects in Colombia since 1970 include Interconexi6n Electrica (3 loans,&#13;
'To avoid confusion, this report will refer to "Interconexi6n Electrica" when naming the former generation and&#13;
transmission company, which was also formerly known as ISA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
US$ 250 million), EPM (4 loans, US$ 430 million), EEB (4 loans, US$ 700 million), Government&#13;
(3 loans, US$ 362 million), FEN and CORELCA (1 loan each for US$ 170 and US$ 36 million,&#13;
respectively). The last investment loan to the sector became effective in May 1987 and&#13;
corresponded to a US$ 172 million credit to EEB ("Bogota Power Distribution II Project" Loan&#13;
2643 CO).&#13;
1.11  In 1990 an extensive OED study2 found that the Bank supported projects generally met&#13;
their physical objectives, and helped advance technical capabilities in the beneficiary agencies, but&#13;
failed to establish a sustainable institutional and financial framework for the sector. It identified&#13;
weaknesses in the power subsector and recommended its restructuring through the introduction of&#13;
adequate regulation and private sector participation.&#13;
1.12 Despite its institutional problems, overall experience with project execution in the&#13;
Colombian power sector has been positive, with the exception of (a) two loans to Empresa de&#13;
Energia de Bogota - EEB (the Guavio project loan supported a hydroelectric project with major&#13;
construction delays and problems, and the Distribution II project was partially canceled by mutual&#13;
agreement due to non-achievement of the project's institutional objectives) and (b) the FEN&#13;
Power Development Finance Project. The Project Completion Report for the latter project (June&#13;
1993) points out that the financial problems of the sector could not be solved by creating a&#13;
specialized financial intermediary such as FEN, and that its potential for mobilizing resources was&#13;
not effective unless the utilities it lent to were restructured and became credit-worthy borrowers.&#13;
These problems, coupled with the OED findings, led to the Bank's support for institutional&#13;
restructuring before new operations could be contemplated.&#13;
1.13 Having achieved the major institutional reforms required for restructuring the energy&#13;
sector, the Bank is now providing support for their implementation through the Energy Sector&#13;
Technical Assistance Project (Loan 3827-CO) which was approved by the Board in December,&#13;
1994.&#13;
1.14  Key lessons which have been learned from other Bank loans include the need to ka)&#13;
position infrastructure projects within a sector-wide institutional context; (b) complement&#13;
investments with technical assistance components to ensure that projects do not fail due to an&#13;
inadequate institutional framework; (c) systematically assess the economic and financial&#13;
sustainability of tariff levels; and (d) embed projects within a balanced investment program. The&#13;
project will intemalize these lessons by: (a) coordinating the proposed actions with the umbrella&#13;
Energy Sector Technical Assistance project currently under execution; (b) providing specif c&#13;
specialized training and technical assistance in the power planning, dispatch and operations areas&#13;
to complement the latter; and (c) by designing the project to support the overall institutiona.&#13;
framework of the sector.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
C. The Power Subsector&#13;
Electricity Demand and Supply&#13;
1.15  During 1994 gross generation reached 39 TWh with a peak demand of around 6900 MW.&#13;
Until the late seventies, electricity demand grew at rates in excess of 10% per year. During the&#13;
early 1980s demand growth decreased to rates on the order of 5% per year. A number of&#13;
economic and social factors explain this change: economic growth diminished and new service&#13;
extensions decreased with the saturation of coverage. Starting in the late eighties and continuing&#13;
into the 1990s, the substitution of electricity by natural gas and LPG has been actively promoted&#13;
and exerted a moderating influence on electricity growth. This effect is expected to continue in&#13;
future years with the extension of natural gas supplies to major cities like Medellin and Cali.&#13;
Finally, tariff adjustments in electricity are expected to continue until they reach marginal cost&#13;
levels, and will also contribute to restrain demand growth.&#13;
1.16  Forecasts for electricity demand have been made within the context of overall energy&#13;
requirements, considering such factors as population growth, economic growth, relative prices&#13;
and interifuel substitution. In 1995, the Ministry of Mines and Energy prepared a forecast using a&#13;
base scenario corresponding to an economic growth rate of 5.1 -5.3% until 2000, stabilizing at&#13;
the 5% level thereafter (these values are slightly lower than the Bank's own projections). On this&#13;
basis, electricity requirements are expected to increase at about 5.3% for the same period.&#13;
1.17  Total effective generation capacity amounts to 10100 MW of which 7900 MW correspond&#13;
to hydro facilities. The major generation enterprise is ISAGEN (2600 MW) followed by the&#13;
municipal utilities of Bogota (EEB - 2200 MW) and Medellin (EPM - 1500 MW); regional&#13;
utilities on the Atlantic Coast (CORELCA), in the South West (CVC and CHB), and several&#13;
distribution companies, which also operate power plants, account for another 3000 MW; the&#13;
Ministry of Finance owns 272 MW in four plants which are operated by local utilities. Finally,&#13;
240 MW of private generation are in service.&#13;
I.18  System dispatch is performed by ISA, which also operates the principal transmission lines.&#13;
Electricity distribution is accomplished by three major municipal utilities in Bogota, Medellin and&#13;
Cali, by 24 regional distribution companies owned by the National Government, and by smaller&#13;
municipal companies, one of which was recently privatized.&#13;
System Expansion&#13;
1.19  System expansion is taking place within the new commercial and institutional framework&#13;
whereby compulsory planning has been replaced by "indicative" planning. In this context, future&#13;
plans are drawn up with the purpose of serving as guidelines for interested investors (which&#13;
include both existing companies as well as prospective entrepreneurs).&#13;
1.20  The incorporation of new investors in the power business (both as a consequence of the&#13;
new institutional framework and the drought-induced emergency) has been successful as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
evidenced by projects such as a 90 MW generation plant in Cartagena developed with local capital&#13;
(Proelectrica), the 100 MW combined cycle gas plant in Barranquilla operated by Sevillana de&#13;
Electricidad, and the ongoing construction of an aggregate 1129 MW of thermal generation with&#13;
the participation of foreign investors.&#13;
1.21  Power plants under construction which are expected to come on line by 2000 include3: (a)&#13;
747 MW of combined cycle gas-fired turbines in the Atlantic Coast owned by ABB/Distral and&#13;
232 MW in the Valle Region owned by Enron/Propal; (b) 450 MW of coal-fired plants to be&#13;
developed by private independent power producers (150 MW of which have already been&#13;
awarded); (c) the 390 MW Porce It hydro plant under construction by EPM (a municipal utility);&#13;
(d) the 340 MW Urri I and the 375 MW Miel I hydro plants under construction by two mixed&#13;
capital consortia and (e) 400 MW (probably gas-fueled) for which potential investors will be&#13;
sought. The response to requests for providing this additional capacity is expected to be highly&#13;
competitive: 21 private sector consortia have expressed interest in developing different power&#13;
plants. Interested investors include existing private generators, oil companies, and industrial and&#13;
agricultural enterprises. The prospective developments include a variety of plant types&#13;
encompassing a large proportion of gas-fueled units, together with coal, fuel oil, heavy crude,&#13;
bagasse and small hydro stations.&#13;
1.22  The expansion of the transmission system is to be developed by ISA. The capacity&#13;
expansion will be achieved by strengthening transmission links through a combination of 500 kV&#13;
and 230 kV lines in order to avoid potential bottlenecks which could lead to either peak rationing&#13;
or to higher operating costs in the system. Furthermore, the development of the transmission&#13;
system is essential for a competitive energy market to operate.&#13;
Electricity Pricing&#13;
1.23  Until 1994, electricity prices were regulated at both the wholesale and retail levels. This&#13;
pricing system was replaced, under the new institutional arrangements, by a competitive market&#13;
for bulk (wholesale) supplies where distribution companies and major consumers (with loads in&#13;
excess of 2 MW) enter into contracts with generation enterprises at freely agreed prices. On a&#13;
day to day basis, generators are reimbursed for sales to the power pool at system marginal cost.&#13;
In addition, regulated transmission charges are levied to remunerate ISA, the interconnection&#13;
company.&#13;
1.24  Final user prices are set by the Energy Regulatory Commission. During the 1970s and&#13;
early 1980's important cross-subsidies were incorporated into retail prices, by charging relatively&#13;
high prices to industrial and commercial users in order to maintain low prices for domestic&#13;
consumers. This policy became financially untenable but tariffs were not reformed and massive&#13;
subsidies were required from the central government. As part of the power sector's financial&#13;
restructuring, tariffs charged to final customers maintained an increasing trend during 1991-94.&#13;
Towards the end of 1994, sector average electricity rates amounted to about 90% of long-run&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

marginal costs. The average rate applied to final customers ranged between 6 and 10&#13;
UScent/kWh.&#13;
1.25  In 1994 the Public Services Law and the Electricity Law provided directives for price&#13;
adjustment by setting strict limits on cross-subsidies and mandating that cost based rates be put&#13;
into place by July 2000 at the latest. Improvements regarding pricing can be expected to continue&#13;
due to (a) the fact that bulk supply prices (which account for over 50% of retail supply costs) are&#13;
to respond to market forces thereby exerting pressure on distribution companies and Government&#13;
to support the ERC in achieving pricing goals; (b) the policy to incorporate private capital into the&#13;
distribution business, which will require sound pricing assurances; (c) the functioning of the&#13;
Energy Regulatory Commission where independent regulators outnumber Government&#13;
representatives and can be expected to resist attempts to freeze prices or otherwise imperil the&#13;
sector's financial health; and (d) provisos in the Domiciliary Public Services Law which explicitly&#13;
require public agencies, which frequently fail to pay their bills, to budget funds for paying for&#13;
public services such as electricity.&#13;
Power Subsector Financial Performance&#13;
1.26  The 1984-90 period was characterized by a considerable deterioration of the subsector's&#13;
financial indicators (see Annex 8 for details). This decline took place because of short-sighted&#13;
policies that prevented electricity prices from keeping up with inflation and the devaluation of the&#13;
Colombian peso. The power sector was heavily subsidized by the Government and average rates&#13;
during 1980-84 covered only about 50-60% of marginal costs.&#13;
1.27  As a result of overbuilding power plants, utilities incurred significant amounts of'external&#13;
debt to fund new investments. The consolidated indebtedness of the power subsector amounted&#13;
to about US$5.2 billion in 1990, roughly equivalent to one third of the country's total external&#13;
debt. The devaluation of the local currency, coupled with low prices, forced many utilities to seek&#13;
Government support for servicing their debt.&#13;
1.28  The sector also showed signs of administrative, financial and commercial mismanagement.&#13;
Power losses, ranging between 14% and 32% in 1990, were out of control in many companies.&#13;
Arrears of energy bills from distributors to generators, and from government agencies and private&#13;
customers to distributors exceeded 6 months in many utilities.&#13;
1.29  As part of the Economic Adjustment Program implemented in 1991, the Government&#13;
defined a long-term strategy to improve both efficiency and the financial situation of power&#13;
utilities. This strategy aimed at: (a) reducing the utilities' foreign debt service; (b) establishing a&#13;
rational tariff structure and a sustainable rate level; and (c) improving managerial efficiency of&#13;
distribution companies.&#13;
1.30  The debt issue was successfully dealt with through a debt/equity swap and a debt/asset&#13;
swap whereby the Government took charge of many company debts in exchange for assets or for&#13;
equity shares in the enterprises. Pricing reforms were implemented in order to reflect economic&#13;
costs and to reduce subsidies to residential customers by following a well-defined plan. Finally,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the Government established performance contracts with utilities profiting from Government loans&#13;
and guarantees; although there have been some positive gains in efficiency, there remains vast&#13;
room for improvement in most distribution utilities.&#13;
Power Sector Financial Perspectives&#13;
1.31   As a result of the actions taken during the 1991-94 period, most power sector companies&#13;
now exhibit satisfactory indicators. Rates of return exceed 8% in the large companies as well as&#13;
many smaller, solvent and profitable companies. Future performance will depend on a continued&#13;
application of pricing adjustments together with efficiency improvements to keep costs under&#13;
control.&#13;
1.32  Financial projections for the sector indicate that the performance of most enterprises in the&#13;
sector is satisfactory, with the exception of a few small distribution companies whose assets only&#13;
account for about 4% of total subsector assets, and who would still remain insolvent and&#13;
unprofitable. The latter group includes utilities with a predominantly residential market structure&#13;
of low income customers. A number of such utilities are expected to require support due to the&#13;
cross-subsidization applied to retail sales. Under LRMC pricing levels, the support required from&#13;
the Government in 1995 would amount to around US$56 million, or less than 5% of the sector's&#13;
revenues.&#13;
1.33   At current average price levels, on the order of 90% of marginal costs, most companies&#13;
exhibit a healthy financial position. However, there is room for efficiency improvements&#13;
particularly in regard to lowering commercial losses and controlling theft which are only possible&#13;
through strong management action. For example, if commercial losses could be reduced, through&#13;
metering controls, from their present level of 22% to levels on the order of 10% to 12%, the&#13;
increase in gross revenues would have the same financial effect of an immediate increase in prices&#13;
to marginal cost levels.&#13;
D. Power Subsector Poliicy and Issues&#13;
1.34   Energy Sector Policy. The Government's overall policy regarding the energy sector&#13;
consists of implementing the mandates contained in the Public Service Law and the Electricity&#13;
Law. The general orientation consists of: (a) limiting the state's intervention in the sector to the&#13;
formulation of general policy guidelines and to regulation, thereby allowing the private sector to&#13;
undertake investment and operational tasks; (b) stimulating competition; (c) encouraging private&#13;
sector participation; and (d) establishing cost-reflective tariffs with due consideration to low&#13;
income users.&#13;
1.35   The sector is emerging from a traumatic supply crisis which curtailed energy demand by as&#13;
much as 15% during the period February 1992-March 1993. This crisis provided additional&#13;

impetus for reform by forcing the installation of emergency generation with hitherto nonexistent&#13;
private sector participation.&#13;
1.36  The Bank has supported the Government since 1991 in the process of power sector&#13;
institutional reform. The Bank has helped to shape and to define a new vision for the energy&#13;
sector by: (a) supporting analyses of the sector's problems and identifying the issues; (b)&#13;
exploring the options for addressing them; (c) fostering constructive debate concerning past&#13;
conceptual and systemic deficiencies attributable to inadequate institutions; (d) designing a reform&#13;
program; and (e) by supporting the implementation of this program.&#13;
1.37  The sector was gradually reorganized, with Bank support, during the 1991-94 period.&#13;
The process incorporated efficiency, accountability and financial responsibility incentives into&#13;
sector corporations. Financial restructuring whereby the Government injected massive resources&#13;
into the sector was accompanied by tariff reforms which have steadily raised electricity prices with&#13;
a view to reaching economic cost levels by 1998.&#13;
Power Subsector Reform Program&#13;
1.38   The major elements of the restructuring process culminated in 1994 with the approval by&#13;
Congress of two major statutes: a Public Services Law which provides a general framework for&#13;
the supply and pricing of electricity, water, natural gas and local telephone services; and an&#13;
Electricity Law which spells out sector-specific provisions regarding organization, responsibilities&#13;
and functions of different entities. Both of these laws emphasize the introduction of competitive&#13;
incentives and provide for the regulation of non-competitive supplies. The Government&#13;
anticipated the approval of these laws by creating the required regulatory institutions, by fostering&#13;
the incorporation of private capital into the generation business and by reorganizing some of the&#13;
major companies in the sector in order for them to operate according to the proposed structure.&#13;
1.39 IThe objectives behind the Government's power subsector institutional reforms include: (a)&#13;
fostering efficiency through competition together with a strong, transparent and independent&#13;
regulatory framework; (b) an institutional restructuring involving the separation of national&#13;
transmission from generation and the corporatization of existing state power companies by&#13;
ultimately transforming them into joint stock corporations; (c) completing the financial&#13;
restructuring and rehabilitation of the subsector through tariff and subsidy reforms;(d) promoting&#13;
the participation of private sector capital in new projects; and (e) the divestment of existing power&#13;
plants and utilities.&#13;
1.40  The implementation of these reforms has proceeded successfully: the Energy Regulatory&#13;
Commission (ERC) has been operating since 1993; the conditions for a competitive market at the&#13;
generation level have been defined and their implementation was initiated in early 1995. Private&#13;
sector participation has been concentrated mainly in generation through the installation of more&#13;
than 1000 MW of thermal capacity. These developments were followed by the organization of&#13;
the open access network operated by ISA (the borrower) as an independent, regulated,&#13;
transmission company, following provisions in the Electricity Law.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
Current Reform Implementation Issues&#13;
1.41  The major hurdles regarding the power sector's reorganization and financial rehabilitation&#13;
were cleared during 1991-94, and the system can be characterized as entering a period of&#13;
institutional consolidation which will require assistance while experience is gained under the ne..&#13;
rules, as well as putting in place supportive infrastructure. Some of the issues to be addressed in&#13;
this new phase are:&#13;
(a)   Power Market and System Expansion. Since early 1995 a market for bulk&#13;
energy and capacity has been operating. The final objective of this market is to&#13;
create an environment whereby private producers will engage in generation&#13;
investments based on the income they can derive either from the spot market or&#13;
from long term contracts with large users (such as major consumers or distribution&#13;
companies). This has enabled the Government to limit its commitments and&#13;
exposure to the transmission and distribution components of the industry.&#13;
Although no major investments in new capacity are required in addition to those&#13;
already planned or in execution until 2000, beyond that date the system will have&#13;
to prove that it can survive as a mature, competitive, industry. Until now the&#13;
private sector's response has been encouraging, as evidenced by the numerous&#13;
proposals, both local and foreign, for new plant development.&#13;
(b)   Transmission and Dispatch. A major responsibility for enabling the market&#13;
concept to be successful has been vested in ISA, the transmission and dispatch&#13;
enterprise. ISA is in the process of upgrading its system in order to fulfill the&#13;
required dispatching and clearing house functions for the market to function&#13;
smoothly. The interconnection network will also require reinforcements in order&#13;
to allow an unimpeded flow of energy between generators and demand centers.&#13;
These investments are to be partially financed by the proposed loans and paid&#13;
through adequate, regulated, network charges.&#13;
(c)   Distribution. At the distribution level, private sector participation has been less&#13;
successful. Since the initiation of the reform process only one small distribLition&#13;
company has been privatized. This can be partially explained by the reluctance of&#13;
local politicians to relinquish the power they exert over a number of these&#13;
companies. However, the possibilities for the ultimate privatization of distribution&#13;
companies have improved with the approval of the Public Services Law and will&#13;
continue to do so with planned tariff increases. Through the Energy Sector&#13;
Technical Assistance Project, the Bank is assisting the Government to evaluate&#13;
options and formulate a strategy to introduce private management and equity in&#13;
distribution companies, and to increase their overall efficiency. In addition, the&#13;
Government has requested Bank assistance in the preparation of a Power&#13;
Distribution Project to reduce costs,to adopt main distribution companies'&#13;
structure to the reformed sector organization and to improve and expand&#13;
distribution services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
(d)   Tariff Adjustment Program. The proposed tariff adjustment path appears to be&#13;
sound and strikes a balance between financial objectives and a constitutional&#13;
mandate to provide subsidies to lower income consumers (see the financial&#13;
projections in Annex 8). The adjustment is taking place within the context of the&#13;
new sector laws promulgated in 1994 which allow a six-year period for executing&#13;
it. Nevertheless, Government plans are to reach the full economic cost levels by&#13;
1998.&#13;
1.42  The most pressing short term implementation problem facing the sector consists of setting&#13;
up the competitive market for bulk supplies. This involves regulatory issues, which constitute a&#13;
major challenge for the Energy Regulation Commission and transmission and dispatch issues&#13;
under responsibility of ISA.&#13;
1.43  The sound functioning of the bulk power market, under the reformed legal and regulatory&#13;
framework requires that appropriate procedures are set in place to: (a) avoid monopolistic&#13;
pricing, collusion and other price-distorting behavior and (b) allow price signals to operate so that&#13;
they attract investors to the generation business. This issue is being addressed with support from&#13;
the Technical Assistance Loan for the energy sector, which has a component exclusively oriented&#13;
towards ERC support.&#13;
1.44  The transmission and dispatch issues involve the need for upgrading dispatching&#13;
procedures and implementing financial clearing house functions that are acceptable to participants&#13;
in the bulk market. This upgrading will require investments in both telecommunications and&#13;
computing equipment and software. For the market to function effectively, transmission&#13;
bottlenecks should be lifted in order to allow free energy flows between generators and bulk&#13;
consumers. The proposed project will support ISA in addressing these issues by: (a) financing the&#13;
required control center hardware and software; (b) financing transmission lines and substations;&#13;
and (c) complementing the Technical Assistance Project with an additional training component&#13;
oriented towards dispatch and clearing-house functions.&#13;

2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Context&#13;
2.1    The country's prospects for economic development and the Bank's assistance strategy&#13;
were discussed by the Board on December 16, 1993. The country assistance program seeks to&#13;
help the Government consolidate and increase its structural reforms, to support private-sector-led&#13;
growth, to improve the delivery of basic services, to protect the environment, and to strengthen&#13;
institutional capabilities. It proposes to maintain a lending program with emphasis on technical&#13;
assistance and it explicitly endorses support for a comprehensive reform of the power sector&#13;
which would create an environment which attracts private capital into the sector. The proposed&#13;
project responds to this strategy by supporting the implementation of the ongoing power sector&#13;
reform program. It is also the first major lending operation for the power subsector since 1987&#13;
and the first loan to ISA since 1978.&#13;
2.2    Over the past four years, the Bank has had an active role in promoting institutional reform&#13;
in the Power Sector in Colombia. During this period, substantial changes have been made to the&#13;
legal/regulatory and the institutional frameworks to introduce competition and transparent&#13;
regulation. Two complementary approaches have been adopted for this support: (a) provision of&#13;
technical assistance in preparing and implementing the sector reform program, and institutional&#13;
strengthening; and (b) lending support for specific projects and investments which will consolidate&#13;
the reform process and promote the effective operation of key sector institutions.&#13;
2.3    Technical assistance will continue to be provided through the Energy Sector Technical&#13;
Assistance Project which has supported institutional reform within the energy sector as a whole.&#13;
It includes: (a) assistance in setting up regulatory agencies and developing pricing policies for&#13;
power and gas; (b) assistance to the power and gas sectors in the process of incorporating private&#13;
capital and introducing competitive incentives; (c) assistance in developing environmental&#13;
regulations and guidelines for the energy sector; and (d) development of a demand side&#13;
management strategy.&#13;
2.4   Processing of the proposed project would be a continuation in the implementation of&#13;
Bank-endorsed policies: It will advance the power sector reform program by consolidating a&#13;
stronger national transmission system and by supporting the organization of a bulk supply market&#13;
for electricity.&#13;
B. Project Objectives and Description&#13;
2.5    The project's overall objective is to support power sector reform by facilitating the&#13;
operation of a competitive bulk supply market for electricity. Specifically, the project seeks to lift&#13;
transmission constraints that hinder an open access of publicly as well as privately owned power&#13;
generators to the grid and to support ISA in its role as transmission network operator, system&#13;
generation dispatcher and commercial transactions coordinator. The project will be a key&#13;
component of the comprehensive power sector restructuring that is being put in place with Bank&#13;
assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
2.6   The project consists of three components (see also Annex 10 - Project Description, Costs&#13;
and Implementation Plan):&#13;
PART A: Energy Control Center (ECC) and Financial Settlement Center (FSC).&#13;
2.7   This component includes the upgrading of the data acquisition and control functions of&#13;
ISA's existing ECC and the installation of a FSC. The project will finance the purchase of&#13;
measurement, data acquisition, telecommunications, data processing equipment and software.&#13;
PART B: Strengthening and Expansion of the Interconnected Transmission System.&#13;
2.8   This component includes investments to strengthen and expand the national transmission&#13;
system; the following is a summarized list of major elements:&#13;
(i)    San Carlos-San Marcos System. (a) construction of a single circuit, 384&#13;
km, 500 kV transmission line interconnecting the East Antioquia&#13;
hydroelectric complex to the Valle del Cauca Department; (b) construction&#13;
of a single circuit, 30 km, 230 kV transmission line interconnecting the La&#13;
Virginia and La Hermosa substations; (c) expansion of the San Marcos&#13;
500/230 kV substation; (d) construction of the La Virginia 500/230 kV&#13;
substation; and (e) construction of the San Carlos 500/230 kV substation.&#13;
(ii)    Atlantic Coast System: (a) reactive compensation for the Chinui&#13;
substation; (b) expansion of the Cerromatoso 500/230 kV substation; (c)&#13;
construction of the Uraba 230/115 kV substation; (d) construction of the&#13;
double circuit, 80 km, 230 kV La Loma- El Copey transmission line; (e)&#13;
expansion of the 500/115 kV Chinu substation; (f) expansion of the&#13;
500/230 kV Sabanalarga substation.&#13;
(iii)    Other Transmission Components: (a) reactive compensation for the&#13;
Cafio Lim6n substation; (b) construction of the single circuit, 160 km, 230&#13;
kV transmission line between Paipa and Bucaramanga; (c) constnrction of&#13;
the Paipa 230 kV substation; (d) construction of the Bucaramanga 230 kV&#13;
substation; and (e) construction of a link between the San Felipe substation&#13;
and the 230 kV Esmeralda-La Mesa transmission line;&#13;
PART C: Technical Assistance:&#13;
2.9   This part includes the provision of consulting services and training programs to assist ISA&#13;
in the strengthening of its capabilities to assume its roles of: (i) transmission network operator, (ii)&#13;
power dispatch coordinator and (iii) bulk electricity transaction clearing house all in the areas of&#13;
power market, planning and engineering, systems operations and dispatch, management of&#13;
financial matters and environmental issues and other areas agreed with the Bank. Corresponding&#13;
activities will be agreed upon between ISA and the Bank subject to an annual plan to be approved&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
by the Bank. An initial list of studies and training activities for the first year of execution of the&#13;
project is included in Annex 10.&#13;
C. Project Cost and Financing&#13;
2.10  The cost estimate for the project is summarized in Table 1, details are in Annex 10. The&#13;
project's total cost including taxes, duties, physical contingencies, price contingencies and interest&#13;
during construction is estimated at US$ 410.0 million, of which US$ 249.3 million (60%)&#13;
corresponds to direct plus indirect foreign costs and US$ 160.7 million (40%) corresponds to&#13;
local costs. Taxes and import duties are estimated at US$43.9 million. Cost estimates are in&#13;
December 1994 prices.&#13;
2.11   Costs are based on ISA's estimates, which have been reviewed by the Bank and found&#13;
acceptable. ISA maintains a database of transmission and substation costs with similar&#13;
characteristics to those of the project; it was updated during project preparation on the basis of&#13;
recent international bids for similar projects. Physical contingencies, which amount on average to&#13;
12%, were estimated based upon the type of project and the status of its design. Price&#13;
contingencies assume: (a) a project execution period of six years based on the 1994 Bank&#13;
standard disbursement schedule for power projects in LAC, and (b) escalation rates over and&#13;
above base cost plus physical contingencies of 2.6% for 1995-2001.&#13;

2.12      To estimate total required financing, the Bank's interest rate of 7.1%  per annum  (effective&#13;
at the time of the appraisal) and a 0.25% p.a. commitment fee were used for the foreign&#13;
component. Interest during construction for the local currency was estimated at 5% per annum in&#13;
constant terms, which is equivalent to the rate applied by FEN to loans to utilities for power&#13;
projects. Bank loans for a total of US$ 249.3 million are proposed to cover the foreign currency&#13;
component. Local financing would be provided by ISA's own cash generation (see Financial&#13;
Analysis).&#13;

2.13  The proposed loan package comprises two loans. A first loan for US$145 million (58% of&#13;
total) would be a LIBOR-based US$ Single Currency Loan, with 17 years repayment including a&#13;
grace period of 4 years. A second loan equivalent to US$104.3 million (42% of total) would be a&#13;
Currency Pool Loan involving 17 years repayment, including a grace period of 4 years.&#13;
D. Institutional Arrangements&#13;
2.14  Responsibility for overall oversight of ISA's expansion plans is vested in the Ministry of&#13;
Mines and Energy (MIME) and the National Planning Department (Department Nacional de&#13;
Planeaci6n, DNP). MIME and DNP are responsible for evaluating ISA's proposals and making&#13;
recommendations to the CONPES. The proposed project, which is part of the Third&#13;
Transmission Expansion Plan of ISA, has been reviewed by MIME and DNP and approved by&#13;
CONPES (National Council for Economic and Social Policy). CONPES's approval includes&#13;
authorization to enter into financial arrangements for internal and external financing for the&#13;
project.&#13;
2.15  The project would be implemented under Loan Agreements between the Bank and the&#13;
Borrower and Guarantee Agreements between the Bank and the Government.&#13;
E. Project Implementation&#13;
2.16  The project will be implemented by ISA. Interconexi6n Electrica, ISA's predecessor had&#13;
extensive, lengthy experience and performed well in implementing Bank financed projects. Part A&#13;
of the project (Energy Control Center and Financial Settlement Center) would be the&#13;
responsibility of ISA's National Dispatch Directorate. Implementation of Parts B (Expansion of&#13;
the Interconnected Transmission System) and C (Technical Assistance) of the project would be&#13;
the responsibility of a Project Executing Unit (PEU) under the Transmission Directorate. The&#13;
PEU is well staffed with experienced professionals and has enough resources and autonomy to&#13;
seek consultant support whenever this is needed. The Project Execution Directorate has&#13;
successfully carried out several projects financed by loans from the Bank and IDB and has proven&#13;
implementation capabilities.&#13;
2.17  Project preparation is well advanced. Pre-feasibility studies for the ECC and FSC centers&#13;
have been prepared by ISA, have been reviewed by the Bank and found satisfactory.&#13;
Additionally, ISA has procured and will finance from its own resources the participation of a&#13;
specialized consulting firm for completing the project design and the preparation of bidding&#13;
documents for the implementation of the ECC and the FSC. These are expected to be ready by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
end 1995; before any procurement for this project component takes place. However, to ensure&#13;
that designs for the ECC and the FSC are completed in time, during negotiations agreements were&#13;
reached with ISA that, as a condition for disbursement for goods and services under part A of the&#13;
project, ISA will provide satisfactory final design of the ECC and the FSC. Planning and&#13;
engineering design studies for the transrnission component, which accounts for about 95% of the&#13;
total project cost, have been prepared by ISA. ISA will procure in due time and will finance with&#13;
own resources specialized support from engineering firms for the preparation of executive design&#13;
and bidding documents and for the supervision of the construction for each subcomponents of&#13;
part B of the project in accordance with corresponding execution schedules. Implementation&#13;
procedures submitted by ISA have been reviewed by the Bank and found satisfactory.&#13;
2.18     In view of the new functions assigned to the company, the appraisal team reviewed&#13;
with ISA those areas that require strengthening. These include: (a) the modification of dispatch&#13;
rules and the establishment of clearing house functions; (b) power system planning; (c) training for&#13;
the use of new dispatch and settlement models; and (d) development of costing tools to calculate&#13;
network costs and network charges.&#13;
2.19  To deal with the latter subjects, Part C of the project would provide technical assistance in&#13;
the form of studies by specialized consultants and training --mostly abroad-- for ISA's&#13;
professional staff. During negotiations ISA and the Bank agreed that ISA will prepare two annual&#13;
plans for the carrying out of Parts C1 (studies) and C2 (training) of the Project to be approved by&#13;
the Bank before the end of the preceding year. A list of the activities comprised in the studies&#13;
program for the first year of execution of the Project was agreed upon, including the terms of&#13;
reference for the consultant services and is available in the project file (see Annex 14).&#13;
2.20   Project Implementation Plan (PIP): During appraisal ISA submitted a satisfactory&#13;
Project Implementation Plan (PIP). The PIP details the project management and implementation&#13;
arrangements, is part of the project file and is referenced in the loan documents. For each&#13;
component of the project the PIP addresses its principal features: scope and objectives,&#13;
implementation plan, and implementation and disbursement schedules. The PIP will be the basic&#13;
reference for ISA's management in order to monitor project implementation. The PIP will also&#13;
provide the reference benchmarks for Bank supervision of the project's components.&#13;
2.21 Procurement arrangements for the proposed project are summarized in Table 2 5.&#13;
Purchase of goods and equipment and contracting of construction works to be financed with&#13;
proceeds of the loans for the following activities would be carried out in accordance with the&#13;
Bank procurement guidelines, Bank Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA&#13;
Credits (January 1995). Purchases of goods and equipment for transmission lines and substations&#13;
for a total of US$129.0 million would be procured under International Competitive Bidding&#13;
(ICB). Computers and other electronic equipment for implementing the ECC and FSC for a total&#13;
amount of US$ 12.3 million would be procured through Limited International Bidding (LIB)&#13;
because there is only a limited number of potential suppliers. Works for construction of&#13;
ISA is exempted from application of Law^ 80, which regulates contracts involving public entities, in respect to all&#13;
aspccts of Project execution, including procurement. (See Annex 1, Electricity Law.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
transmission lines and substations for a total of US$31.6 million would be procured under ICB.&#13;
Equipment and installation services for substations and transmission lines for a total amount of&#13;
US$50.0 million would be procured under ICB. Procurement of consultant services for a total&#13;
amount of US$5.0 million will be carried out in accordance with the Bank Guidelines for the&#13;
Use of Consultants (August 1981). An aggregate amount of US$1.0 million would be used to&#13;
reimburse foreign expenditures incurred by ISA in its training abroad of ISA staff, such as tuition&#13;
fees and travel expenses for attending courses and seminars. Bank issued standard bidding&#13;
documents would be used for all procurement of goods and works. For complex time-based&#13;
consulting assignments Bank issued standard form of contract for consulting services will be used.&#13;
To expedite procurement, an initial list of procurement packages was agreed with ISA and is&#13;
available in Annex 10. Procurement packages under ICB arrangements would be about 30 with&#13;
an average cost of about US$ 7.4 million, a minimum cost of US$ 1.0 million and a maximum&#13;
cost of about US$ 38 million. There would also be about 50 locally procured packages not&#13;
financed by the Bank with an average cost of about US$500,000; these packages are not likely to&#13;
attract foreign bidders and local procurement is considered to be the most efficient procedure.&#13;
Goods and services not financed with proceeds of the loans would be procured locally under&#13;
ISA's established procurement practices, which have been reviewed by the Bank and found to be&#13;
satisfactory.&#13;

2.22   Prior Review. All contracts for goods and works under ICB and LIB and all contracts&#13;
related to training services (other than consultant services) equal or exceeding US$ 300,000&#13;
would be subject to the Bank's prior review. The provisions of the Consultant Guidelines&#13;
requiring prior Bank review or approval of budgets, short lists, selection procedures, letters of&#13;
invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and contracts, shall not apply to: (a) contracts for the&#13;
employment of consulting firms estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent each; or (b)&#13;
contracts for the employment of individuals estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent&#13;
each. However, said exceptions to prior Bank review shall not apply to: (a) the terms of&#13;
reference for such contracts; (b) single-source selection of consulting firms; (c) assignments of a&#13;
critical nature, as reasonably determined by the Bank; (d) amendments to contracts for the&#13;
employment of consulting firms raising the contract value to US$100,000 equivalent or above; or&#13;
(e) amendments to contracts for the employment of individual consultants raising the contract&#13;
value to US$50,000 equivalent or above. Contracts subject to prior review would cover about&#13;
85% of Bank financed goods and services. The balance of contracts would be subject to ex-post&#13;
review by the Bank after contracts are awarded. When evaluating bids for goods, qualified&#13;
domestic manufacturers would be eligible for a 15% margin of preference, or the import duty,&#13;
whichever is lower.&#13;
2.23   Disbursements. ISA expects to complete project implementation in four years.&#13;
However, under the 1994 standard disbursement profile for power projects implemented in the&#13;
LAC region, the loans would be disbursed over a seven years period. The disbursement schedule&#13;
is attached in Annex 10. Proceeds from the loans would be applied to finance following estimated&#13;
amounts of project expenditures:&#13;
(a)    90% of expenditures for works (US $25.0 million);&#13;
(b)    100% of foreign expenditures and 90% of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) for&#13;
the purchase of goods (US$ 10.0 million for part A of the Project and US$ 103.6&#13;
million for parts B and C of the Project);&#13;
(c)    95% of expenditures for contracts for the supply of equipment and installation&#13;
thereof (US$ 43.0 million);&#13;
(d)    100% of foreign expenditures for consultant services (US$ 0.5 million for part A&#13;
of the Project and US$ 4.5 million for parts B and C of the Project);&#13;
(e)    100% of foreign expenditures for training of ISA staff abroad and training fees&#13;
(US$ 1.0 million); and&#13;
(f)   interest and other charges under the Bank loan, (US$ 36.8 million);&#13;
(g)   unallocated expenditures (US$ 24.9 million).&#13;
2.24   Disbursements against statement of expenses (SOE) will be made in respect of training&#13;
service contracts costing less than US$ 300,000 and for consultant services not subject to prior&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

- 19-&#13;
review. Retroactive financing of up to US$ 10 million for eligible expenditures (made after&#13;
March 31, 1995, but no more than 12 months before signing) would be provided for under each&#13;
loan. Eligible expenditures would have to follow procurement procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. The Project is expected to be substantially completed by 2001 with a closing date of&#13;
December 31, 2002.&#13;
2.25   The Borrower would establish for each loan Special Accounts in US dollars with a&#13;
commercial bank acceptable to the Bank to cover eligible Bank expenditures under the loan. The&#13;
authorized allocation to the Special Accounts would be US$8 million for each loan. However,&#13;
they should not exceed US$4 million during the start-up of the project. The balance could be&#13;
requested when the total amount disbursed from each loan account plus outstanding commitments&#13;
has reached US$20 million. Subsequent replenishment by the Bank into the Special Accounts&#13;
would follow the procedures by which Bank funds are disbursed against actual expenditures.&#13;
2.26   Monitoring. With regard to the overall company's performance, ISA and the Bank have&#13;
agreed on a set of operational and financial performance indicators, which are attached as Annex&#13;
15. During negotiations agreement was reached that ISA would comply with these indicators.&#13;
ISA would also be required to submit biannual reports on the progress of implementing the&#13;
project together with an evaluation of its performance measured against targets defined in the&#13;
PIP. Arrangements for auditing are discussed in para. 4.9. ISA and the Government will conduct&#13;
with the Bank formal project review meetings within four months of the close of ISA's fiscal year&#13;
starting in 1996, for the purpose of discussing project progress, overall project execution during&#13;
the preceding year, and ISA's financial situation and local funding capability in subsequent years.&#13;
The meeting to be held not later than April 30, 1998, will be the Mid-term Review of the project.&#13;
F. Environmental Considerations&#13;
2.27  Over the past years ISA has demonstrated a noteworthy commitment to incorporating&#13;
environmental issues within the decision making process to select optimal expansion plans. ISA's&#13;
methodology for taking into account socio-environmental aspects is considered by the Bank to be&#13;
"state of the art" in the planning and management of its transmission system. During project&#13;
preparation, following World Bank guidelines, ISA carried out a Sectoral Environmental&#13;
Assessment (SEA) of the Colombian Power Sector6. The SEA included among others, a general&#13;
evaluation of the status of socio-environmental issues at the sectoral level, a diagnosis of&#13;
environmental impacts derived from the existing transmission system as well as the impact&#13;
expected from the new transmission lines foreseen in the expansion plan.&#13;
2.28  The civil works to be financed include power transmission lines and substations which will&#13;
involve small potential environmental risks. ISA prepared an environmental analysis7 which&#13;

identifies the main environmental and social constraints within the proposed transmission&#13;
corridors. The environmental constraints identified by the ISA report were incorporated in the&#13;
design, construction and operation of the transmission lines.&#13;
2.29  The corridors do not affect indigenous reserves, cultural protected areas, densely&#13;
populated settlements, natural reserves, national parks, water supply facilities or important&#13;
productive activities. About 60 households currently located along the corridors will require&#13;
relocation. This is usually simpler for transmission lines as compared to other types of&#13;
infrastructure construction, as buildings only require a few meters displacement and in most cases&#13;
land can continue to be used for agriculture or grazing. In this case it will consist of building new&#13;
houses, and in most cases families will be able to remain on their land. In 1991 the Colombian&#13;
Electric Power Sector, under ISA's leadership, approved a Resettlement Policy (RP) that meets&#13;
the Bank's requirements. By applying the RP, ISA has successfully undertaken the resettlement&#13;
of scattered populations through a participative approach; the concerned families have been&#13;
contacted and informed of ISA's resettlement policies as well as their rights in terms of&#13;
compensation and indemnity. According to Bank policy, a resettlement plan is not required for&#13;
projects with this number of displacements; nonetheless, ISA is preparing resettlement plans and&#13;
environmental management plans which will be submitted for Bank approval before opening the&#13;
bidding process for the civil works of each transmission line (see para. 2.30 bellow).&#13;
2.30  The project has been rated in the "B" environmental category, i.e. no major environmental&#13;
impacts are expected as a result of either construction or operation of the new transmission&#13;
facilities. Although the project was rated with environmental category "B", the borrower was&#13;
required to prepare a project-specific environmental report for each transmission line. Each report&#13;
must contain a detailed Environmental Management Plan (EMIP) to mitigate undesirable effects on&#13;
human populations and natural resources during construction and operation of the project. Once&#13;
the EMP and resettlement plan for each line have been agreed with the Bank, and before&#13;
authorizing any contractor to initiate the construction and assembly phase of each transmission&#13;
line, ISA will provide each of the persons affected by the works enforceable rights to a new home&#13;
or adequate compensation or both, according to the corresponding resettlement plan.&#13;
2.31  It is worth noting that ISA has put in place an Environmental Management System (EMS)&#13;
specially designed for transmission projects, which is being successfully applied to the existing&#13;
500kV system and to other 230kV lines. The current EMS designed by ISA has been applied in&#13;
other electric power sectors in Latin America, particularly in Ecuador and Uruguay where ISA is&#13;
providing technical assistance. Finally, by encouraging more efficient power generation and by&#13;
helping to reduce electricity losses, the project will promote energy efficiency and thereby have a&#13;
positive indirect environmental impact.&#13;

3. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A. Economic Evaluation&#13;
Control Center and TA Benefits&#13;
3.1   The benefits of the new dispatch and financial settlement centers, and of the technical&#13;
assistance to help in their operation, are not directly quantified because of the difficulties&#13;
associated with estimating the corresponding benefits. They are essential for the power market to&#13;
develop. Without such new equipment and the requisite training, the existing dispatch center,&#13;
which is based on equipment that is substantially out of date, will be unable to either operate the&#13;
network efficiently or to create proper financial accounting for the settlements required under the&#13;
new commercial rules. It is recognized worldwide that energy management control centers&#13;
represent a small portion of sector investments while their benefits are high.&#13;
Transmission Component Benefits and Costs&#13;
3.2   The project for the investment in new transmission plant would help Colombia to reduce&#13;
the costs of electricity supply through increasing both its quantity and quality by: (a) reducing&#13;
transmission losses by upgrading certain sections of the grid from 230 kV to 500 kV; (b)&#13;
allowing more power and energy to be transmitted and delivered to consumers; and (c) allowing&#13;
generation to take place at lower cost plants than would otherwise be possible, hence leading to a&#13;
reduction in total fuel costs for the system as a whole. In addition, the strengthening of the&#13;
national grid will promote competition between generators by reducing the likelihood that,&#13;
because of transmission bottlenecks, high cost plants may operate when lower cost plants are&#13;
available. The stronger transmission system will therefore act as an increased stimulus to the&#13;
entry of private power producers by ensuring that they will be able to fully utilize any cost&#13;
advantages that they possess.&#13;
3.3   The economic analysis consists of. (a) a cost-effectiveness analysis whereby it is shown&#13;
that the components of the project are (i) the least cost alternative for accomplishing their&#13;
objective and (ii) each element of the project is more economic than its second best alternative&#13;
which would provide equivalent services; and (b) an economic analysis which shows that the&#13;
resources used in the proposed investment program provide an acceptable rate of return. The&#13;
detailed results are included in Annex 11 and are summarized below.&#13;
Cost-effectiveness analysis.&#13;
3.4   In February 1995 the Ministry of Mines and Energy and Interconexi6n Electrica prepared&#13;
a least cost generation and transmission expansion plan, covering the period up to 2007, based on&#13;
a detailed macroeconomic scenario and an associated electricity demand forecast. This plan&#13;
defined reliability criteria for both generation and transmission and then estimated costs of a&#13;
number of alternative scenarios for expanding generating capacity and the transmission system, in&#13;
order to determine the least cost program. The transmission lines and substations included in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
project are part of the least cost expansion plan which was reviewed by the Bank and found&#13;
satisfactory. This indicative expansion plan was officially endorsed by the Government on 15&#13;
February 1995.&#13;
3.5   The two main components of the project, namely the San Carlos-San Marcos system and&#13;
the Loma-EI Copey system were evaluated. The approved expansion plan provides a joint&#13;
generation/transmission optimization and the analysis performed for the appraisal seeks to verify&#13;
that they constitute a least cost solution by comparing them with second-best alternatives.&#13;
3.6   San Carlos-San Marcos Component. The second-best alternative to the San Carlos-San&#13;
Marcos project consists of relocating gas-based generation plants to the Southwest of the country&#13;
where they would supply the equivalent load carried by the project. The tradeoff involved&#13;
consists of comparing the costs of the project (i.e. electricity transportation) with the alternative&#13;
of transporting natural gas. The analysis yielded an Equalizing Discount Rate (EDR) of 20%, i.e.&#13;
the discount rate whereby the project becomes equivalent to the second-best alternative; this&#13;
discount rate exceeds the benchmark discount rate (12%). The ratio between the project's costs&#13;
and the savings provided against the second-best alternative yields a Benefit/Cost (B/C) ratio of&#13;
1.6. These results confirm the San Carlos-San Marcos project as the best technical alternative for&#13;
supplying electricity to the Southwest of the system.&#13;
3.7   Loma-Copey Component. The Loma-Copey project will provide an additional&#13;
interconnection between the central and Atlantic Coast subsystems. It is also closely associated&#13;
'with evacuating energy from the 300 MW Termocesar coal-based power plant which is included&#13;
in the approved expansion plans for 1995-2000 and which will provide fuel diversification in the&#13;
future. The second-best alternative to the Loma-Copey project would require replacing this coal&#13;
plant by equivalent coal-based generation in the Northeast and Atlantic Coast regions. Two&#13;
alternatives were identified; however, they require higher investments compared to the&#13;
Termocesar/Loma-Copey project, and although their fuel costs are slightly lower they do not&#13;
compensate for the additional investment. The cost ratio between the project and the alternatives&#13;
is on the order of 1.04. The Equalizing Discount Rate is higher than 50%. The results confirm&#13;
the Loma-Copey project as a required component of the expansion plan. It should be noted that&#13;
the project will provide additional benefits by strengthening the Central-Atlantic Coast links which&#13;
are critical under low-ninoff conditions.&#13;
3.8    Economic Analysis. This phase of the analysis consists of evaluating the rate of return&#13;
for ISA's overall investment program. The benefits associated with the program consist of (a)&#13;
operating benefits due to lower generating costs associated with lifting bottlenecks in the&#13;
transmission system and (b) incremental energy benefits which can be provided to consumers.&#13;
Operating benefits were quantified by comparing operating costs with and without the investment&#13;
program. Incremental energy benefits were quantified using as proxy the increased sales at the&#13;
price of electricity (which provides a lower bound to consumer surplus) minus the&#13;
subtransmission and distribution investment costs required to reach the consumer.&#13;

February 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
3.9   The results of the analysis yield an Internal Rate of Return for ISA's investment program&#13;
of 27% which exceeds the 12% benchmark discount rate. It should be noted that the proposed&#13;
project accounts for a large portion (over 90%) of ISA's investment program. Over 90% of the&#13;
benefits associated with the project are operating benefits associated with the lower running costs&#13;
of thermal plants which the transmission reinforcements will achieve. This confirms the role of&#13;
the project as a major element required to facilitate the operation of the bulk market for&#13;
electricity.&#13;
B. Risk Analysis&#13;
3.10   This is a low risk project. Implementation risks will be minimized by the use of&#13;
experienced consultants in the preparation and evaluation of bids, and contracting the execution&#13;
of critical components of the project through "erect and build" schemes.&#13;
3.11  Regarding the institutional risk, the execution of the proposed project is essential for the&#13;
success of the overall power sector reform process, which hinges on the satisfactory&#13;
implementation of the new Public Services and Electricity Law approved by Congress in July,&#13;
1994. The new law establishes sound principles, but opposition from regional and other interest&#13;
groups, such as unions, management of a number of existing utilities, and some local governments&#13;
could slow down its enforcement. However, since the approval of the Electricity Law, no major&#13;
problems of this nature have appeared and the Government intends to continue with its&#13;
implementation.&#13;
3.12  Other risks which could impact negatively on the project include: (a) insufficient&#13;
institutional capabilities in government to develop and enforce the regulations needed for the&#13;
successful implementation of the competitive power market; (b) sluggish private sector response;&#13;
and (c) political reluctance to implement the mechanisms for tariff and transmission charge&#13;
adjustments. The Energy Sector Technical Assistance Project is addressing the issue of&#13;
institutional weakness. Regarding (b), the private sector has responded positively by investing in&#13;
over 1000 MW of power generation and by expressing interest in developing another 1700-&#13;
2600MW. Regarding the price adjustment risk, although the Government has lost its&#13;
discretionary power and can no longer set prices by fiat, it is conceivable that it could pressure the&#13;
Regulatory Commission in order to reduce the rate of adjustment of electricity prices for the sake&#13;
of achieving short term macroeconomic goals or fulfilling political commitments. Three&#13;
safeguards exist for avoiding this contingency: (i) the terms of the Public Services Law itself, (ii)&#13;
the attitude of the regulators who may be amenable to marginal revisions but would oppose major&#13;
changes to the price adjustment plan due inter alia to the personal legal risks involved, including&#13;
penal risks, in disregarding the mandates of the Law and (iii) pressures from private sector&#13;
interests in the generation business who form a constituency in favour of a sound tariff policy to&#13;
protect their revenues from the consequences of uneconomic pricing. Environmental risks are&#13;
small and hedged.&#13;
3. 13  ISA selected US dollar single currency loan terms to the maximum extent possible to&#13;
reduce its currency risk. ISA has substantial yen liabilities and has chosen US dollar to achieve a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
better overall balance in its foreign currency exposure. ISA's choice of a LIBOR interest rate&#13;
basis marginally increases interest rate risk since ISA's tariff level is subject to a cap imposed by&#13;
the Regulatory Commission. ISA has capacity to bear this risk, however, as most of its liabilities&#13;
carry stable interest rates.&#13;
3.14   A series of sensitivity analyses against less favorable cases are considered in order to&#13;
determine the robustness of the conclusion that the transmission components of the project are&#13;
economically justified. In the case of the cost-effectiveness analysis, increases in investment costs&#13;
and decreases in gas transportation and coal costs were analyzed. The projects are justified under&#13;
reasonable variations of these critical variables.&#13;
3. 15 Similarly, the Internal Rate of Return for ISA's transmission investment program&#13;
continues to be justified (IRR of 19%) when investment costs are increased by 10% or when&#13;
operating benefits are decreased by 10%. The IRR shows negligible sensitivity to changes in the&#13;
value of incremental energy benefits. If demand fails to develop as expected (e.g. a 4.3% average&#13;
growth rate), the investment program yields a lower IRR of 18% which still exceeds the 12%&#13;
benchmark. Finally, the project risks becoming uneconomic in the unlikely event that operating&#13;
savings decrease by around 27% over the program's lifetime with respect to their estimated&#13;
values, or that investment costs increase by 30% with respect to their budgeted amounts.&#13;

4. THE BORROWER&#13;
A. ISA&#13;
4.1    The borrower of the proposed loans would be ISA, one of the two companies which&#13;
originated from Interconexion Electrica. ISA has kept the full name of the former Interconexi6n&#13;
Electrica S.A. and the alternative denomination of the acronym ISA9. Interconexi6n Electrica was&#13;
established in 1967 with Bank sponsorship in order to interconnect the regional electricity&#13;
companies, to develop future generation projects and to coordinate system dispatch. It was a&#13;
stock company (Sociedad An6nima) whose assets by end 1994 were estimated at US$ 2.7 billion,&#13;
constituted by generation plants for a total of 2,542 MW of installed capacity, about 6,300 km of&#13;
transmission lines, about 8,000 MVA of installed capacity in transformner facilities, and&#13;
headquarters offices and other facilities in Medellin. In December 1994, Interconexion Electrica&#13;
employed a total of 1380 skilled and well trained staff.&#13;
4.2   Interconexi6n Electrica was initially owned by three regional companies and a government&#13;
institute. In subsequent years, ownership was expanded to include CORELCA, the Atlantic Coast&#13;
utility. With the financial restructuring that took place in 1991-92, the Government became the&#13;
major shareholder in the company. The Bank has supported the development of Interconexi6n&#13;
Electrica since 1968 through four loans totaling US$ 300 million which financed the national&#13;
interconnection grid and three power stations. The execution o-Fall these projects was successful.&#13;
The company also executed the 500 kV interconnection project between the central region and&#13;
the Atlantic Coast, partially financed by a US$ 50 million Bank loan.&#13;
4.3   The development of Interconexi6n Electrica can be traced through four distinct periods:&#13;
(a) during 1967-76 it accomplished the 230 kV interconnection of the generation companies in the&#13;
central region of the country and established itself as the sector's leader, by assuming&#13;
responsibility for sector planning and implementing most of the sector's expansion; (b) during&#13;
1976-90 Interconexi6n Electrica reinforced the national interconnection by implementing the 500&#13;
kV Sabanalarga-San Carlos system and became the major generator with the development (with&#13;
Bank support) of the Chivor, San Carlos and Jaguas hydro power plants, together with smaller&#13;
thermal units; (c) in 1990 it initiated a four-year period of financial consolidation which improved&#13;
and strengthened the company's finances; and (d) in 1994 it initiated a major reorganization which&#13;
eventually facilitated the unbundling of generation and transmission services in Colombia in line&#13;
with the newly established regulatory reform.&#13;
4.4    As part of the power subsector reform program, Interconexi6n Electrica was split into two&#13;
autonomous corporations in 1995: a generation company (ISAGEN) which is now in charge of&#13;
the generation facilities and a transmission company which has continued to be known as ISA.&#13;
ISA will constitute the backbone of the power market, responsible for transmission and dispatch&#13;
functions, and, by delegation, will operate the commercial settlement facilities of the newly&#13;
9To avoid confusion this report refers to Interconexion Electrica when naming the former generation and&#13;
transmission company, which was also formerly known as ISA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
established power market. ISA's assets have been defined at the vesting date as US$ 690 million&#13;
or 26% of the total assets of Interconexi6n Electrica. ISA and ISAGEN are controlled by the&#13;
National Government, who owns 76% of their shares. Currently the Government is considering&#13;
alternatives for privatizing ISAGEN, while privatization of ISA will eventually take place only&#13;
when both the company and the commercial system have further consolidated.&#13;
4.5   When Interconexi6n Electrica was split, its assets were assigned to ISA and ISAGEN&#13;
according to their function; a similar process was performed for long term debts, whereby the&#13;
latter were allocated according to which company owned the assets financed by a given credit.&#13;
Formalizing this process requires lenders' cooperation, mainly from the Bank, IDB and FEN who&#13;
are creditors for over 95% of Interconexi6n Electrica's debt. ISA and ISAGEN are in the process&#13;
of petitioning their respective creditors to concur with its proposed division of liabilities and to&#13;
implement the required modifications in the outstanding loan agreements; in principle, the banks'&#13;
operational management have agreed to submit in due time this proposal to their boards. In the&#13;
interim ISA and ISAGEN have maintained joint and several liability with respect to the former&#13;
Interconexi6n Electrica's debts, contracted on or before April 30, 1995. In those cases where the&#13;
original borrower Interconexi6n Electrica received the guarantee of Colombia, both ISA and&#13;
ISAGEN expect to be released from the joint and several liability, to complete the seperation of&#13;
the companies. ISA has shown satisfactory evidence that any residual liability it may have with&#13;
respect to ISAGEN's debts will not imperil the performance indicators agreed during&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
4.6   Structure. ISA is structured along business centers: transmission, dispatch and&#13;
telecommunications, duly supported by financial, administrative, legal and environmental services.&#13;
As part of the restructuring of Interconexi6n Electrica, ISA has sustained a major reorganization&#13;
aimed at: (i) improving the efficiency of the technical development process; (ii) separating&#13;
accounts and establishing performance indicators to identify sources of income and room for&#13;
improvement; (iii) improving planning methods; and (iv) instituting a client oriented attitude.&#13;
Interconexi6n Electrica was an efficient, well run utility and prospects are that ISA, which has&#13;
kept 959 staff from the former utility, will follow suit. ISA's current organization chart is shown&#13;
in Annex 9.&#13;
4.7   Accounting. ISA keeps its accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting&#13;
principles regulated by decree #2649 issued in December 1993, which are consistent with those of&#13;
international accounting standards. Since 1992 ISA's accounting system is adjusted monthly due&#13;
to inflation in accordance with decrees #2911 and #2912. ISA has a well developed computerized&#13;
system for financial, inventory, and budget control, billing, banking, and payroll.&#13;
4.8   Financial Planning. Since December 1989, ISA's budget has been submitted to the&#13;
National Council for Fiscal Policy (CONFIS - Consejo Nacional de Politica Fiscal) for inclusion in&#13;
the National Budget. In addition to the annual budget, ISA prepares a corporate budget in&#13;
November of each year. A preliminary ten-year investment plan is also prepared with its&#13;
corresponding financial projections. NfME revises the plan and presents it to CONPES for&#13;
approval. ISA has adopted adequate long-term financial planning software based on a model&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
developed by IDB to provide management with a reliable long-term view of the expected financial&#13;
performance of the utility.&#13;
4.9   Audits. ISA's financial statements are audited by Paez y Asociados, an independent&#13;
auditing firm. Audit regulations and standards are based on international auditing practices.&#13;
During negotiations, agreement was reached with ISA that: (i) ISA's annual and Bank-financed&#13;
project accounts will be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; (ii) ISA will&#13;
maintain separate accounts for the project; and (iii) ISA will provide the Bank, within four months&#13;
after the end of each fiscal year, audits covering project accounts, the special accounts, the&#13;
statement of expenditures, and the company's financial statements.&#13;
4.10 Internal Audit. The Internal Audit Unit reports to the general manager; it is in charge of&#13;
periodically examining the operational, financial and accounting procedures, the management&#13;
controls, and making a security assessment of the computational software system. Currently, ISA&#13;
is developing an internal auditing control plan, which would include periodic operational and&#13;
financial auditing to improve efficiency in the use of ISA's resources, based on the&#13;
recommendations made by a consultant firm.&#13;
4.11  Insurance. ISA follows sound insurance practices, generally consistent with power&#13;
utilities practices. 39% of ISA's transmission power sub-stations are insured against fire,&#13;
explosion, and flooding. For cost reasons, ISA's transmission lines are not insured. Replacement&#13;
of transmission assets eventually damaged becomes part of the operating costs, which is normal&#13;
practice for large utilities.&#13;
4.12  Taxes. As a result of the Public Services Law, ISA is taxed under conditions similar to&#13;
other sector companies. ISA is now required to pay 37.5% income tax. ISA must pay 15%&#13;
custom duties, 14% VAT on imported goods and engineering consultant services, and on profits&#13;
of construction and assembly services. VAT paid for capital expenditures is discounted from&#13;
income tax at the commissioning year.&#13;
B. Financial Analysis&#13;
4.13  ISA was recently created on a sound financial footing. Most of Interconexi6n Electrica's&#13;
financial problems were related to the generation business and were inherited by ISAGEN. ISAs&#13;
financial performance is expected to continue being satisfactory as long as the ERC's rules are&#13;
applied consistently. In particular, ISA's income hinges on a periodic adjustment of transmission&#13;
charges as well as its regulated revenue ceiling. The rules for adjusting these values provide for&#13;
keeping up with inflation as measured by the Wholesale Price Index, plus an additional allowed&#13;
real growth rate to generate cash needed for expansion investments.&#13;
4.14 ISA's projected financial statements for 1995-2004 are presented in Annex 12, and are&#13;
summarized in Table 3 for the disbursement period. The rate of return on revalued assets between&#13;
1995 and 2004 is expected to average 6-8% depending on the depreciation method. The cash&#13;
operating ratio (total cash operating expenses/total gross revenues) would improve from 21% in&#13;
1995 to about 20% in 2001, indicating that annual revenues tend to increase more rapidly than&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
operating costs. The self-financing ratio is expected to be over 50% during the period. The debt&#13;
service coverage is expected to vary between 1.7 and 2.3 and to exceed the benchmark value of&#13;
1.5.&#13;

4.15    Sensitivity analyses of the financial projections were carried out for the following cases:&#13;
(A) revenues are not adjusted according to the regulatory provisions to provide for increase of&#13;
investment made after 1999; (B) same as case A plus a delay in the execution of the investment&#13;
program, which forces ISA to pay penalty charges; (C) same as case A plus higher inflation (local&#13;
inflation 3 percentage points higher and foreign inflation 1 point higher). Cases DI and DII&#13;
simulate an eventual delay in payment by the weaker distribution companies; the case corresponds&#13;
to a one-year cessation of payments during 1997 (a year when ISA's cash flow is more&#13;
demanding), followed by a resumption of payments and a settlement of arrears. Case DI assumes&#13;
that 'small and unsolvent utilities" (see Annex 8, Table 8-7) delay payments. Case DII assumes&#13;
that in addition to the arrears supposed in DI "small and under recovery utilities" also delay&#13;
payments, resulting in a shortfall of 20% of ISA's revenues. Case D is unlikely to materialize: the&#13;
Energy Regulatory Commission has set stiff penalties for non-payment of transmission charges;&#13;
the delinquent company must settle its debts and tender a bank guarantee covering the next year's&#13;
payments; otherwise, if the company does not comply, fines can be imposed and managers can be&#13;
discharged and denied employment in utility companies for a ten year period. Annex 12,&#13;
Attachment 6 shows the results of this analysis for 1995-99 and for 2000-04. The results for the&#13;
coming five years (1995-99) are summarized in Table 4.&#13;

4.16 These indicators show that ISA's financial performance would remain sound even under&#13;
these scenarios. Even in the event of a higher foreign inflation, which would affect debt service&#13;
payment and the amount of capital expenditure, ISA internal cash generation would be sufficient&#13;
to fund over 30% of the investment program. The cash operating ratio, average rate of return,&#13;
and the debt service coverage ratio also remain at an acceptable level (under 21%, over 8.0% and&#13;
1. 5, respectively). Among the information to be routinely provided by ISA once a year would be&#13;
the results concerning the monitoring indicators shown in Annex 15.&#13;
4.17   To ensure a sound financial performance during project implementation, agreement was&#13;
reached at negotiations with ISA and the Government that:&#13;
(a)    ISA's cash operating ratio be no higher than 23%;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
(b)   ISA incur additional debt only if its debt service coverage ratio&#13;
exceeds 1.5;&#13;
(c)   ISA's self financing ratio remain equal to or above 30%;&#13;
(d)   ISA provide the Bank by June 30 of each year with updated financial reports for&#13;
the previous year and projections for the next five years, including monitoring&#13;
indicators (Annex 15).&#13;
4.18  Another source of financial risk could consist of the Government's desire to pressure the&#13;
Regulatory Commission in order to reduce the rate of adjustment of electricity prices for the sake&#13;
of achieving short term macroeconomic or political goals. This risk has been considerably&#13;
reduced as the Government has lost its discretionary power and would have to overcome the&#13;
following obstacles: (a) the terms of the Public Services Law which would require revising its&#13;
conditions in Congress; (b) the attitude of the regulators who may eventually agree to marginal&#13;
changes but would oppose major adjustments due, among other, to long term penal risks involved&#13;
in disregarding the mandates of the Law; and (c) pressures from private sector generators who&#13;
form a constituency in favour of sound pricing policies.&#13;
4.19  The nominal rate of adjustment of regulated tariffs decreased in 1995 relative to 1994, but&#13;
prices have continued to rise with the objective of reaching marginal cost levels. Furthermore, the&#13;
slower adjustment rate has been compensated by two factors: (a) the lower devaluation of the&#13;
colombian peso as compared to inflation (which is significant as most power system costs are&#13;
dollar-denominated) and (b) lower generation prices (10-15% below 1994 levels) which have&#13;
emerged from the competitive market in 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
5. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
5.1    During negotiations, agreement on the following arrangements were obtained:&#13;
(a)   ISA will complete the final design of the Energy Control Center and the Financial&#13;
Settlement Center before disbursements for goods and services under part A of&#13;
the project are made (see para. 2.17). ISA will prepare before the end of each year&#13;
two annual plans, one for studies and one for training (see para. 2.19).&#13;
(b)   ISA will use Bank standard documents for procurement of the goods and services&#13;
financed under the Bank loans (see para. 2.21)&#13;
(c)   ISA and the Government will conduct with the Bank formal project review&#13;
meetings within four months of the close of each of ISA's fiscal year starting in&#13;
1996, for the purpose of discussing project progress, overall project execution&#13;
during the preceding year, and ISA's financial situation and local funding capability&#13;
in subsequent years. The meeting to be held not later than April 30, 1998, is&#13;
expected to be the Mid-term Review of the project. (see para. 2.26.)&#13;
(d)   Prior to inviting bids for construction of each transmission line, ISA will submit a&#13;
resettlement plan and an environmental management plan to the Bank for approval.&#13;
ISA may invite bids for the construction and erection of the transmission lines after&#13;
resettlement plans and environmental management plans have been agreed with the&#13;
Bank and thus the contractor could start manufacturing of the equipment to be&#13;
used in the construction of the transmission lines. However, before authorizing&#13;
any contractor to initiate the line construction and assembly phase, all&#13;
corresponding rights on land shall have been acquired and each of the persons&#13;
affected by the works shall have been provided, according to the corresponding&#13;
resettlement plan, with enforceable rights to have a new home or adequate&#13;
compensation, or both (see para. 2.29 and 2.30).&#13;
(e)   ISA will execute in a timely manner all actions determined in the resettlement plans&#13;
and environmental management plan (see para. 2.30).&#13;
(f)   ISA will: (i) have its annual and Bank-financed project accounts audited by&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; (ii) maintain separate accounts for&#13;
the project; and (iii) furnish to the Bank within four months after the end of each&#13;
fiscal year the audited project accounts, special accounts, statement of&#13;
expenditures, and ISA's financial statements (see para. 4.9).&#13;
(g)   All necessary measures will be taken to ensure that from 1996 onwards ISA's cash&#13;
operating ratio does not exceed 23% (see para. 4.17).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
(h)   ISA may incur additional debt only if its debt service coverage ratio&#13;
exceeds 1.5 of its projected debt service obligations (see para. 4.17).&#13;
(i)   ISA's self financing ratio will be not lower than 30% from 1996 onwards (see para.&#13;
4.17).&#13;
(j)   ISA will furnish the Bank by June 30 of each year, updated financial reports for the&#13;
previous year and projections for the next five years for its revenues, capital&#13;
expenditures, borrowing and debt service, accounts receivable, and finances (see&#13;
para. 4.17).&#13;
(k)   ISA will implement the project in accordance with the agreed Project&#13;
Implementation Plan (Annex 10) and coordinated through a project unit, with an&#13;
adequate implementation structure.&#13;
Recommendations: On the basis of the agreements reached, two Bank loans are recommended:&#13;
(i) a US$145 million LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loan; and (ii) a US$104.3 million&#13;
equivalent currency pool loan.&#13;

ANNEX 1&#13;
COLOMBIA&#13;
POWER MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
POWER SECTOR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.    The Colombian power sector underwent a major restructuring during the 1991-94 period.&#13;
The restructuring was initiated by the government after the Operations Evaluation Department&#13;
(OED) reviewed 1970-87 Bank lending to the power sector in Colombia and concluded that the&#13;
sector was a source of chronic administrative and financial problems for the government and an&#13;
obstacle to development'. The power rationing suffered by the country in 1992, as a consequence&#13;
of inadequate system reliability and severe drought deepened the perception by the government&#13;
and the public at large that major reforms should be introduced in the sector.&#13;
2.    The major elements of the restructuring process culminated in 1994 with the approval by&#13;
Congress of primary legislation in the form of two major statutes: a Public Services Law which&#13;
provides a general framework for the supply and pricing of electricity, water, natural gas and local&#13;
telephone services, and an Electricity Law which defines the sector structure and the&#13;
organization, responsibilities and functions of different entities. Both laws emphasize the&#13;
introduction of competition and provide appropriate regulation of non-competitive supplies.&#13;
3.    Based on provision of the Public Services law, a regulatory entity, the Superintendency of&#13;
Domiciliary Public Services (SSP), was created and, in accordance with provisions of the&#13;
Electricity Law, the electricity and gas regulator (the Regulatory Commission for Electricity and&#13;
Gas) is also in place. In addition to the primary legislation, these entities are in charge of issuing&#13;
secondary legislation as appropriate.&#13;
B. Primary Legislation&#13;
The Domiciliary Public Services Law&#13;
4.    This "umbrella-type" law covers the following main subjects:&#13;
* Responsibilities entrusted to different government levels;&#13;
* Corporate organization of public service enterprises;&#13;
* Taxes;&#13;
* Concessions for use of public goods;&#13;
lThe World Bank 1990. Colombia - The Power Sector and the World bank, 1970-1987, Operations Evaluation&#13;
Department, Report No. 8839.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
*  Market structure and regulation;&#13;
*  Regulatory organizations;&#13;
*  Pricing rules and subsidies;&#13;
*  Conditions for supplying public services; and&#13;
*  Special short term provisos for evolving from the then current setup.&#13;
5.    Government Rsponsibilities. The central government is assigned the responsibility for&#13;
overall policy making. Sector objectives are: to make electricity available to the population at&#13;
reasonable prices, to increase service coverage, and to enhance quality of service. Government&#13;
responsibilities are to assign concessions for the use of public goods (water sources and the&#13;
electromagnetic spectrum) through the different Ministries (Ministry of Development for water,&#13;
Ministry of Mines and Energy and Ministry of Telecommrrunications). The municipalities are&#13;
entrusted with the primary responsibility of ensuring the provision of public services within their&#13;
jurisdiction. Public enterprises are constrained to incorporating adequate funding for the payment&#13;
of public services in their budgets, and to paying for them. Disciplinary penalties for non-&#13;
compliance are set.&#13;
6.    Corporate Oganization. Organizations that provide public services are constrained to&#13;
operate in the form of stock corporations, with the exception of publicly owned companies which&#13;
can either become stock corporations or "industrial and commercial state enterprises". In any&#13;
case, the emphasis is on assuring that the regulated companies operate as corporations with no&#13;
links to political bodies such as city councils or other government entities. In particular,&#13;
municipalities are limited to providing public services directly only as a last resort, which would&#13;
presumably apply to small communities for services such as water supply. The budget for public&#13;
service enterprises is to be approved by their Boards, thereby eliminating the interference of city&#13;
councils which have traditionally used this power to influence corporate decisions. Public service&#13;
corporations are constrained as far as possible to being "single purpose" in order to avoid&#13;
conflicts of interest and monopolistic practices.&#13;
7.    Taxes. Public service corporations are constrained to be taxed in conditions similar to&#13;
other private sector companies. The existing municipal companies are exempted for a period of&#13;
seven years from this requirement.&#13;
8.    Concessions. This type of contract is required for using public goods such as water&#13;
resources or the electromagnetic waves for communications. These concessions are to be&#13;
negotiated with the Government. All providers of public services are subject to performance&#13;
controls by the Regulatory Commissions set up by the law and are required to retain external&#13;
auditors.&#13;
9.    Market Sructure and Regulation. Contracts regarding the supply of public services are&#13;
to be treated as private sector contracts. The law seeks explicitly to promote competition&#13;
whenever possible and emphasizes the limitation of monopolies or monopolistic practices.&#13;
"Exclusive service areas" are acknowledged as necessary for supplying certain services. They are&#13;
constrained to being assigned by the municipalities using competitive bidding procedures and are&#13;
subject to Regulatory Commission approval. Such rights must have a termination date. The law&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
acknowledges the right for alternative suppliers to challenge the exclusivity to provide services by&#13;
offering lower cost services.&#13;
10.   Regulatory Organizations. The law establishes three Regulatory Commissions (water,&#13;
telecommunications and energy) and a Superintendency of Public Services. The Regulatorv&#13;
Commissions are composed by the Minister responsible for a given service, three commissioners&#13;
and the director of DNP. The role of the Regulatory Commissions consists of supervising the&#13;
supply condition of services, resolving conflicts between suppliers, supervising market operations&#13;
to prevent non-competitive behavior on the part of suppliers, establishing prices for regulated&#13;
services and, when necessary, ordering the liquidation of deficient official organizations. The&#13;
Superintendency evaluates the performance of public service suppliers in accordance with&#13;
guidelines furnished by the Regulatory Commissions. The Superintendency and the Regulatory&#13;
Commissions are to be funded from levies on the suppliers of public services.&#13;
11.   Pricing. Prices fall into two categories: regulated supplies and those that respond to&#13;
market supply and demand, which are allowed to fluctuate. The Regulatory Commissions can&#13;
establish optional tariff categories and consumers are allowed to choose between different options&#13;
subject to paying for the required metering equipment. Prices for regulated supplies are&#13;
established following "tariff formulae" defined by the Regulatory Commission. The resulting&#13;
tariffs should have a five-year application span with periodic updating using the CPI index.&#13;
12.   Subsidies. Subsidies and cross subsidies are regulated according to the following&#13;
guidelines:&#13;
?  Funds for cross subsidies can be levied by charging prices above service costs, as long&#13;
as they do not exceed 20%;&#13;
-  Subsidies are to be channeled to users of strata 1, 2 and 3. Limits for subsidy&#13;
allocation, as a percentage of service costs are 50%, 40% and 15% for strata 1, 2 and&#13;
3, respectively.&#13;
-  In any case, the prices charged should cover the operations, maintenance and&#13;
administrative costs of the service.&#13;
*  Subsidies can be assigned by the national government or by local governments.&#13;
13.          The Ministries are responsible for assessing the overall subsidy requirements to be&#13;
paid by the Government and incorporating them in the National Budget.&#13;
14.   Supply Conditions. The law sets out detailed rules concerning the relationships between&#13;
suppliers and consumers, regarding billing and measurement procedures and consumer rights.&#13;
15.   Short Term Provisos. The law orders the division of Interconexi6n Electrica into a&#13;
transmission company and a generation company. The law allows a maximum period of six years&#13;
for the adjustment of existing tariffs to the guidelines concerning pricing and subsidies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
The Electricity Law&#13;
16.   This sector-specific statute covers the following subjects:&#13;
(a)    Sector policy and planning;&#13;
(b)    Regulation&#13;
(c)    Electricity generation&#13;
(d)    Interconnection functions&#13;
(e)    Operations&#13;
(f)    Network charges&#13;
(g)    Pricing&#13;
(h)    Environment&#13;
(i)    Legislation applicable to contracts&#13;
(ij)    Concession contracts&#13;
(jk)   Energy conservation and demand management&#13;
(kl)   Short term and transitory provisos&#13;
17.   Policy. The law entrusts the definition of electricity policy to the Policy and Planning Unit&#13;
of the Ministry of Mines and Energy; the functions assigned to this unit consist of assessing&#13;
overall energy requirements and formulating strategies and policies for assuring efficient energy&#13;
supplies. Expansion plans determined by the unit are of a non-compulsory character and the&#13;
corresponding investments are open to be executed by any interested party.&#13;
18.   Subsidiary Role of the State. The Government is entrusted with the ultimate&#13;
responsibility for executing projects which do not elicit interest from other parties.&#13;
19.   Regulation. The Regulatory Commission for energy consists of the Minister of Mines&#13;
and Energy, the Minister of Finance, the director of DNP and five experts. The Commission' s&#13;
budget will be underwritten by the regulated enterprises. Its functions consist of gradually putting&#13;
in place a competitive market, defining network charges, defining a methodology for calculating&#13;
regulated tariff and setting regulated prices, setting the Operations Rules for the electricity&#13;
system, overseeing the operation of the market and resolving conflicts between suppliers.&#13;
20.   Electricity Generation. The generation activity is open to all economic agents who will&#13;
be subject to the operating rules of the system. Generators can participate in the system either&#13;
within a spot market or within a regulated mode whereby they strike contracts with distributors or&#13;
unregulated consumers. Prices in the latter mode are freely established between the parties to the&#13;
contract.&#13;
21.   Interconnection. Owners of transmission lines will continue to own them but must&#13;
comply with the operations rules. The transmission system will be operated by ISA once it is&#13;
reorganized as a single-purpose interconnection enterprise.&#13;
22.   System Operations. The law defines the functions of the national dispatch center and the&#13;
national operations council.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
23.   Pricing. The law allows prices for contracts between generators and bulk consumers to&#13;
be freely agreed upon. It establishes the obligation of network owners to allow access of&#13;
unregulated consumers to the bulk market and spells out penalties for impeding it, and defines the&#13;
structure of regulated network charges.&#13;
24.   Subsidies. The law ratifies the sources of cross-subsidies (up to 20% in excess of costs)&#13;
and establishes the obligation of the government to provide any subsidy shortfall from the national&#13;
budget. It also ratifies the obligation of public and government enterprises to provide funds for&#13;
payment of electricity bills from their budgets and to pay their bills.&#13;
25.   Legislation Applicable to Contracts. The legislation applicable to contracts involving&#13;
power utilities, including those owned by the state, is the same applied to private companies.&#13;
26.   Concession Contracts. The law spells out the terms of a concession contract whereby&#13;
the supplier acquires an obligation to serve within a given service area for those cases in which&#13;
supplies are not forthcoming as a result of market forces.&#13;
27.   Final Provisos. The Regulatory Commission is allowed a period of three years for&#13;
putting in place a competitive market at the generation level. Public enterprises at the national&#13;
level are given six months to be transformed into mixed capital enterprises.&#13;
C. Secondary Legislation&#13;
28.   Secondary legislation for the power sector is constituted by detailed by-laws (Reglamentos)&#13;
issued by the Regulatory Commission and any other regulations which might be specifically delegated&#13;
by the commission to particular Agents (any enterprise of person engaged in generation, transmission,&#13;
distribution or commercialization of electric energy). Regulations issued by the ERC, so far cover the&#13;
following aspects:&#13;
- General provisions for public service, Resolution (Resoluci6n, Res.) 56,&#13;

Subject: Energy Policy Letter&#13;
Dear Mr. Abe:&#13;
I have pleasure in setting out below the principal aspects of the Colombian Government's&#13;
Energy Policy, dealing specifically with aspects of the power sector.&#13;
POWER POLICY OUTLINE&#13;
The following general strategies have been formulated for Colombia's power sector:&#13;
A.    Efficient demand management and rational use of energy within a framework of social&#13;
equity. This strategy includes the definition of a coherent pricing policy and the&#13;
development of a number of energy substitution programs, designed to bring the structure&#13;
of consumption into line with the economic cost and availability of the sources. A subsidy&#13;
structure will be set up as provided in the Power Sector Law. In particular, the use of&#13;
CNG and LPG will be promoted for urban and highway transport, as will programs&#13;
ensuring a rational use of electricity in its various applications.&#13;
B.    Full and efficient energy supply, with appropriate infrastructure and optimum resource&#13;
allocation among energy subsectors, taking account of the vulnerability of the systems and&#13;
promoting private sector participation in the expansion programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
C.    Maintain and increase levels of energy source production and participation in the external&#13;
market. It is particularly important to promote oil exploration and develop mechanisms&#13;
for promoting Colombian coal as part of foreign trade policy.&#13;
D.    Supply energy to rural areas and contribute to regional development. Efforts will be made&#13;
to step up grassroots participation, and the use of such fuels as LPG will be boosted as&#13;
substitutes for wood, as well as the use of unconventional energy sources in the country's&#13;
most remote regions, such as micro hydro plants, where such installations are feasible.&#13;
E.    Improve and preserve the quality of the environment. Action will be taken to strengthen&#13;
the capabilities of the utilities to meet present-day environmental standards, and various&#13;
programs will be promoted to lessen the environmental impact in the different basins.&#13;
F.    Provide effective stimulus to research and scientific and technological development,&#13;
strengthening existing subsectoral research centers and forging stronger ties with&#13;
university programs and with Colciencias concerning specific topics.&#13;
G.    Consolidate the sector's institutional modernization. While competition will continue to be&#13;
regarded as crucial to efficient performance, attention will also be given to the need for a&#13;
regulatory framework that guarantees consumer protection and controls dominant market&#13;
positions.&#13;
The Government's basic aim in formulating the above strategies is to bring its energy&#13;
policies into line with macroeconomic policy goals and with the country's economic and social&#13;
development targets. Within this framework, the following medium and long term objectives will&#13;
be sought: a more reliable and efficient composition of energy source supply, rationalization of&#13;
resource use, cost reduction, expanded coverage, and increased production.&#13;
POWER SECTOR STRATEGY&#13;
The focal points of this strategy are as follows:&#13;
Concentrate government action on the basic functions of regulation, planning and&#13;
oversight of sectoral activities, leaving the business side to be managed by other&#13;
economic agents.&#13;
*     Stimulate competition so as to achieve appropriate levels of sectoral efficiency.&#13;
*     Open up the sector to private investment as a means of strengthening competition,&#13;
enhancing efficiency, and bringing in fresh development capital.&#13;
*     Make the sector's expansion plans less complex and diversify energy supply.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
Set tariffs reflecting the economic cost of power service delivery in the sectors&#13;
where this is possible, and adopt a system of direct and explicit subsidies to meet&#13;
the basic consumption requirements of low-income groups.&#13;
*     Promote financial rehabilitation of the government power companies to strengthen&#13;
their net worth and improve their operational performance.&#13;
ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT&#13;
In the specific case of the power sector, restructuring is now proceeding within the&#13;
framework of Law 142 "governing residential utilities and enacting other provisions" of July 11,&#13;
1994, and Law 143 of the same date "governing the generation, interconnection, transmission,&#13;
distribution and marketing of electricity throughout the national territory, ..."&#13;
As provided in these two laws, the Government will: (a) promote free competition; (b)&#13;
prohibit practices representing unfair competition or the abuse of a dominant market position; (c)&#13;
regulate those situations where, because of the existence of a natural monopoly, free competition&#13;
cannot guarantee efficient service delivery in economic terms; (d) ensure the protection of users'&#13;
rights and the performance of their obligations; (e) incorporate environmental aspects into the&#13;
sector's activities; (f) ensure adequate electricity service coverage in the country's different regiorns&#13;
to meet the basic needs of lower-income consumers; (g) make available the necessary resources to&#13;
cover the subsidies granted to those consumers for basic electricity coverage.&#13;
The above laws ratify and supplement the functions assigned to the Energy and Gas&#13;
Regulatory Board [Comisi6n de Regulaci6n de Energiay Gas - ERC] ancl the Mining and Energy&#13;
Planning Unit [Unidad de Planeaci6n Minero Energetica - UPME] under Decree 2119 of 1992.&#13;
Also to be borne in mind is the creation of the Utilities Superintendency [Superintendencia de&#13;
Servicios Puiblicos] as a technical agency under the Ministry of Economic Development, with&#13;
juridical personality, administrative autonomy, and ownership of its assets.&#13;
PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION&#13;
To promote competition, improve efficiency, and bring in fresh development capital,&#13;
private investment in the power sector will be promoted, especially in connection with the&#13;
expansion programs. The basic conditions for such participation will be created with adoption of&#13;
the implementing regulations to the Electricity Law and completion of the process of financial&#13;
rehabilitation of the enterprises in the sector.&#13;
The following strategies will apply to private capital participation:&#13;
Promote the participation of private investors in development of the generation&#13;
projects included in the expansion plan, preferably through an energy supply&#13;
contract or through association in a mixed enterprise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
Encourage private individuals to develop projects on their own initiative as&#13;
additional agents in the competitive market for large blocks of energy, and to&#13;
assume the respective transaction risks.&#13;
Encourage the purchase of equity participations in the various generating&#13;
companies to be set up using generating plant presently owned by ISA or the&#13;
Government.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES&#13;
Law 56 of 1981, its Regulatory Decree (2024 of 1982), and Law 99 of 1993 represent the&#13;
most significant pieces of legislation for the electricity subsector in terms of environment-related&#13;
provisions. The environmental variable in electricity projects has become extremely important, a&#13;
fact reflected in the newly-created Power Sector Environmental Committee [Comiae Ambiental&#13;
del Sector Elctrico - CA SEC].&#13;
Since 1986, the appraisal of projects under the power sector expansion plan has included&#13;
the costs of environmental protection, based in general on a multipurpose, integrated project&#13;
approach covering technical, social and environmental components. For this reason (and as a&#13;
requirement for approval of loans from the multilateral banks), new generation, transmission and&#13;
distribution projects are now factoring in environmental costs.&#13;
During 1993, a Sectoral Environmental Assessment was conducted for the power sector,&#13;
based on the World Bank's terms of reference and general guidelines for an assessment of this&#13;
type. This study resulted in the identification of a number of strategies and actions that will be&#13;
implemented to improve the sector's environmental performance. The National Energy Plan&#13;
proposes the creation in the Ministry of Mining and Energy of an Environmental Unit, with&#13;
Special Administrative Unit status, to propose and coordinate the energy sector's environmental&#13;
policy and serve as its authorized spokesman vis-a-vis the environmental authorities. This&#13;
proposal is currently under study, and should be finalized during the first half of 1995.&#13;
PROGRESS OF RESTRUCTURING PLAN&#13;
Institutional restructuring is progressing satisfactorily. At end-1992, the Ministry of&#13;
Mines and Energy was restructured under Decree-Law 2119, which set up three new units: the&#13;
Energy Regulation Board [Comisi6n de Regulaci6n Energetica], the UPME, and the Mining and&#13;
Energy Information Unit [Unidad de Informaci6n Minero Energetica], while also redefining the&#13;
role of the Nuclear Affairs Institute [Instituto de Asuntos Nucleares - IAN], changing its name to&#13;
Institute of Nuclear Science and Alternative Energy Sources [Instituto de Ciencias Nuclearesy&#13;
EnergiasAlternativas - INEA]. In addition, Decree-Laws 2120 and 2121 provided for&#13;
conversion of the Colombian Electricity Institute [Instituto Colombiano de Energia Elctrica -&#13;
ICEL] and the Atlantic Coast Electricity Corporation [Corporaci6n Electrica de la Costa&#13;
,4tldntica - CORELCA] into state commercial and industrial enterprises. The Cauca Valley&#13;
Corporation [Corporaci6n del Valle del Cauca - CVC] was subdivided, its electricity side being&#13;
converted into an independent company.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
Under the restructuring legislation, ISA is to be subdivided into two parts. Its General&#13;
Meeting of Shareholders has already approved the subdivision, which will take place during the&#13;
first months of the coming year. Using its existing generating plant and related administrative&#13;
capabilities, ISA will set up a new generating company, eventually giving birth to a number of&#13;
independent companies that will be progressively opened up to private capital. ISA's remaining&#13;
units will be combined into another company, which will be responsible for high-voltage&#13;
transmission and optimum load dispatch in accordance with ERC criteria and parameters, acting&#13;
completely independently of its shareholder companies.&#13;
ERC ACTIVITIES&#13;
ERC became operational in September 1993. It was initially responsible for supervising&#13;
the Colombian Energy Sector Restructuring Program study carried out by Coopers &amp; Lybrand in&#13;
1992 and 1993, and on the basis of the study's findings and recommendations it embarked on a&#13;
course of action to deregulate the market.&#13;
In December 1993, ERC enacted Resolution No. 010 deregulating the market for large&#13;
industrial and commercial consumers. Large consumers were initially identified as those with&#13;
requirements in excess of 2 MW. This threshold could be lowered over time.&#13;
A few days ago, a resolution was published setting out the charges for use of the&#13;
transmission and interconnection network. ERC is also working on the transmission and&#13;
distribution code, operating regulations, and other pieces of secondary legislation essential to the&#13;
creation of a free energy market.&#13;
The regulations will basically address the establishment of standards to promote&#13;
competition in the electricity market and private-sector participation in the expansion of&#13;
generating capacity.&#13;
The policy will be geared to the strengthening of ERC, since together with the standards&#13;
now being prepared it represents the basic instrument for stimulating private-sector participation,&#13;
modernizing companies, and establishing competition in the electricity market.&#13;
UPME ACTIVITIES&#13;
UPME became operational in September 1993. In early 1994 it started work on a study&#13;
for formulation of a first National Energy Plan. During the first six months of this year it&#13;
completed the first integrated energy demand study. It took over the planning functions that the&#13;
former National Energy Board [Comisi6n Nacional de Energia - CNE] had been carrying out for&#13;
the power sector, and is responsible for devising a reference plan for the expansion of generation&#13;
and transmission, which is required by law "... to seek to direct and rationalize both government&#13;
and private-sector efforts to meet the domestic demand for electricity in a manner consistent with&#13;
the National Development Plan and the National Energy Plan." It is currently reviewing the&#13;
Power Sector Expansion Plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
Pursuant to the government guidelines, based on the Power Sector Law, UMPE is the&#13;
instrument that will facilitate the development of integrated energy planning, and on that basis&#13;
give the appropriate signals to the enterprises that design and implement subsectoral policies.&#13;
Consequently, the Government proposes to provide UMPE with those integrated and subsectoral&#13;
planning tools that will enable it to properly perform its functions.&#13;
TARIFF POLICY&#13;
Law 143 addresses the need for a stratified tariff policy to reflect conditions in the&#13;
municipalities and rural areas.&#13;
A major tariff adjustment program was initiated in 1990, designed to achieve targets&#13;
consistent with the economic costs of delivering the service. Through a combination of isolated&#13;
adjustments to certain tariff categories and monthly adjustments in excess of inflation in all&#13;
categories, the average charge to the final consumer was successfully brought up from&#13;
US$0.041/kWh in 1990 to US$0.054/kWh in 1992. In 1993, Resolutions 13, 14 and 15/93 were&#13;
adopted, introducing an adjustment strategy whereby the reference cost based on the economic&#13;
cost of service delivery would be achieved by 1997-98.&#13;
The program of monthly adjustments will be continued over the next few years, with&#13;
introduction of a direct and explicit subsidy system for low-income consumers and introduction of&#13;
the cross-subsidy system provided for in the Power Sector Law and the Residential Utilities Law.&#13;
Such measures are essential to facilitate the operation of a free market of large blocks of energy,&#13;
and to ensure the financial health of efficient enterprises with weak markets, with a high&#13;
proportion of low-income group consumption.&#13;
FINANCIAL SITUATION&#13;
The Government has taken action in terms of capitalization, debt restructuring, and&#13;
debt/equity swaps to address the difficulties of those of the sector's major enterprises which had&#13;
fallen into insolvency or bankruptcy as a result, generally speaking, of stagnating electricity tariffs,&#13;
accelerated devaluation of the peso, and their own high debt levels. During the past few years,&#13;
the Government has contributed over US$1.5 billion to enterprises such as ISA, CHB, ICEL,&#13;
CORELCA, and EEB, and in return has received productive assets and share capital in ISA and&#13;
the ICEL subsidiaries.&#13;
These measures succeeded in bringing about a substantial recovery in the sector's finances,&#13;
although some of the enterprises still face certain isolated and cyclical cash flow problems for&#13;
which additional measures need to be enacted. An analysis is currently in progress, and an&#13;
additional financial recovery plan is expected to be launched by July 1995.&#13;
To ensure the financial viability of the enterprises, their financial recovery will be&#13;
supplemented by the following actions:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
*     Capitalization and refinancing of certain liabilities.&#13;
Setting of tariffs reflecting the economic costs of service delivery, gradually&#13;
eliminating cross-subsidies to the level prescribed by law, and progressively&#13;
introducing a system of explicit direct subsidies for low-income residential&#13;
consumers.&#13;
*     Improved efficiency for the enterprises in the power sector, through energy loss&#13;
and delinquent portfolio control and reduction of operating costs.&#13;
As regards efficiency improvements, the former system has been amended by law and&#13;
placed on a more solid legal footing. Based on their strategic plans and on the criteria developed&#13;
by ERC, the enterprises are required to propose a management control plan, which will need to be&#13;
approved by UPME. This plan will form the basis for the preparation of management contracts to&#13;
be signed with the Superintendency of Public Services, which will also supervise their&#13;
performance. This Superintendency will remain in operation until June 1995.&#13;
EXPANSION OF ELECTRICITY SUPPLY&#13;
The demand for electricity will be met within the context of an integrated energy policy,&#13;
which will ensure that consumption is oriented toward those uses for which it is the most efficient&#13;
energy source. Energy diversification will be a priority, with emphasis on the widespread use of&#13;
natural gas in urban residential areas and of LPG in the remote rural areas.&#13;
The generation and transmission plan, currently being overhauled to bring it into line with&#13;
the new demand forecasts, should be completed by the end of this year. The generation expansion&#13;
capacity projected for the period 1993-2000, before the present updating, consisted in the&#13;
installation of 750 MW (gas), 450 MW (coal), and 1,000 MW (hydro), all projects that can easily&#13;
be replaced. For transmission, the plan was to construct 1,800 km of 230- and 500-kW lines.&#13;
Through flexible indicative planning, the policy will seek to give appropriate signals to&#13;
encourage the private sector to implement the new minimum-cost expansion plan projects, so that&#13;
the Government will execute projects only when it is not possible to obtain private-sector&#13;
collaboration. Particular attention will need to be paid to project execution, to avoid delays that&#13;
could cause future restrictions on supply.&#13;
The projects included in the strategy approved for the generation expansion program are:&#13;

(*): recommended as part of the strategy for 2001-2004&#13;
One of the basic aims of the power policy is to upgrade distribution through attention to&#13;
infrastructure as well as to the utilities' institutional and administrative aspects. Energy losses&#13;
within the electricity distribution system are equivalent to over 20% of energy demand, and&#13;
around 13% of potential users have no access to the service. The distribution system is thus to be&#13;
modernized, with a view to improving service quality and expanding coverage. The modernization&#13;
program, together with the actions set down in the management contracts to be discussed below,&#13;
will help to reduce the level of losses.&#13;
CONCLUSIONS&#13;
This overall strategy has produced successful results, the planned actions having been&#13;
accomplished to the extent described above. The sector has overcome its rationing crisis, and has&#13;
made progress in handling its financial predicament, with a significant drop in the utilities' energy&#13;
arrears to Interconexi6n Electrica S.A., private-sector participation has been achieved through&#13;
mechanisms such as BOOM in thermal generation projects of over 1,000 MW, and laws have&#13;
been enacted regulating the delivery of public services in general and the supply of electrical&#13;
energy in particular. It may be affirmed that the restructuring process, having passed through the&#13;
stages of implementation and institutional organization, is now entering the consolidation phase.&#13;

COLOMBIA&#13;
POWER MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES FOR COLOMBIA&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Colombia's population, 35.7 million according to the 1993 census, occupies an area of just&#13;
over a million square kilometers with about three-quarters of the population living in urban areas.&#13;
Colombia has plentiful natural resources and coasts on both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.&#13;
Mountainous terrain, however, makes internal transportation costly and slows down physical and&#13;
social integration. Solid growth of about 4.5 percent per year for the past four decades, combined&#13;
with a drop in the population growth rate to 1.8 percent per year, have facilitated substantial&#13;
improvement in social conditions. Rich physical resources, a literate and dependable work force, a&#13;
robust private sector, competent macroeconomic management, and political stability are factors&#13;
explaining Colombia's good record of economic development and social improvement over the last&#13;
thirty years.&#13;
2.    During the 1980s Colombia achieved one of the highest and most stable growth paths in&#13;
Latin America. Its prudent and gradual approach to macroeconomic management yielded positive&#13;
GDP per capita growth at a time of decline for most countries in the region. Productivity in most&#13;
sectors, however, remained stagnant. Recognizing this shortfall, the Barco Administration launched&#13;
in 1990 the Economic Modernization Program (EMP)--a set of structural reforms to improve&#13;
efficiency of resource allocation and use.&#13;
3.    President Gaviria's Administration (1990-94). President Gaviria's election in March&#13;
1990, marked the entry of a new generation in government. During his tenure, which concluded in&#13;
August, 1994, the Government implemented a large number of additional structural reforms and&#13;
reoriented the role of the state to focus on the social sectors, infrastructure, and environmental&#13;
protection, and set the framework for the private sector to be the main driving force in the&#13;
economy. The centerpiece of the structural reforms was trade liberalization, but this was&#13;
accompanied with reforms in the financial sector, tax system, foreign exchange market and&#13;
regulations on direct foreign investment. Congress approved a new central bank law giving the&#13;
monetary authorities greater autonomy. The labor regime was modified to reduce labor rigidities&#13;
and facilitate industrial restructuring. Public monopolies were eliminated in sectors critical to trade&#13;
flows, including railways, ports, shipping, and agricultural marketing. Most of the government's&#13;
non-oil industrial holdings were divested, as were the five banks nationalized during the banking&#13;
crisis of 1982-85. On the political front, the constitutional reform of 1991 advanced the process of&#13;
decentralization mandating the delegation of both central government revenues and responsibilities&#13;
for the provision of basic social services to subnational governments. International capital markets&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
have reacted positively to Colombia's development granting it one of the highest ratings in Latin&#13;
America.&#13;
4.    President Samper's Administration (1994-98). The Samper Administration,&#13;
inaugurated on August 7, 1994, put forward its policy agenda in the recently completed 1994-&#13;
98 national development plan now being discussed in Congress. The four-year plan, which is&#13;
known as the Salto Social (the Social Leap), focused on four critical areas of action: (i) social&#13;
development; (ii) competitiveness of the economy; (iii) environment; and (iv) decentralization&#13;
and institutional strengthening. All four elements of the strategy are to be pursued in tandem.&#13;
Among the policy initiatives launched during the first six months of the Administration,&#13;
probably the most important one was the negotiation of a social pact with labor unions and the&#13;
business sector. The social pact, signed on December 9, 1994, was proposed to underpin the&#13;
Government's effort to reduce inflation. Preliminary results are encouraging. Other policy&#13;
initiatives of the new Administration were a series of measures to support agriculture--&#13;
including increased protection through the introduction of domestic procurement agreements&#13;
for key crops--and a proposal submitted to Congress to establish an oil stabilization fund to&#13;
smooth the spending of oil revenues.&#13;
Recent Economic Development&#13;
5.    Preliminary data indicate that output expanded by 5.7 percent in 1994 led by buoyant&#13;
investment expenditures and a continued strong performance in the construction, commerce,&#13;
finance, and transport sectors. With the buoyancy of economic activity, the unemployment rate&#13;
dropped to 7.4 percent in the third quarter of 1994, the lowest rate observed in recent years.&#13;
Inflation remained at the same level of 1993, with consumer prices rising by 22.9 percent in&#13;
1994.&#13;
6.    The strength of economic activity and sustained private capital inflows--despite&#13;
increased restrictions on external borrowing--sparked a rapid increase in imports (with equally&#13;
strong growth of capital and consumer goods imports). Notwithstanding a 14 percent increase&#13;
in export value--reflecting the surge in coffee export prices in the second half of the year--the&#13;
external current account deficit remained wide at around 5 percent of GDP in 1994. Overall,&#13;
there was a small decrease in net international reserves for the year as a whole of around&#13;
US$330 million, bringing net reserves to US$7.5 billion, or nearly 6 months of imports of&#13;
goods and services.&#13;
Mediumn Term Economic Perspectives&#13;
7.    Colombia is starting to face an oil boom derived from the newly-discovered Cusiana&#13;
and Cupiagua oil fields that could put the economy on a faster growth path--sustained GDP&#13;
growth of almost 6 percent per year is within reach in the medium term. Overall oil production&#13;
is expected to increase from approximately 480,000 bpd in 1993 to around 1,000,000 bpd in&#13;
1997 effectively doubling the participation of the oil sector in total GDP by the end of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
decade. The present value of the net income flows to be generated by the new oil discoveries&#13;
between 1993 and 2005 amount to approximately US$15 billion, equivalent to 28% of GDP.&#13;
8.     Colombia is expected to consolidate the gains of the structural refonn of the past four years&#13;
and accelerate the pace of economic growth. In response to the newly-created incentive structure,&#13;
the implementation of an appropriate regulatory framework, and the foreign exchange revenues&#13;
from higher oil exports, productivity is expected to improve and per capita GDP growth to rise&#13;
above 3 percent per year. For the second half of this decade, private investment is expected to&#13;
average 14 percent of GDP and public investment 9 percent of GDP, a combined average of more&#13;
than 5 percentage points of GDP higher than the 1980s average.&#13;

ELECTRICITY DEMAND&#13;
I .    Historical Data: The electricity sector's historical net generation of electricity for the&#13;
1975-94 period is shown in Table 6-1. Net generation grew at an average rate of 6.4% per&#13;
annum. However, the actual growth rate has been uneven: during 1975-80 it averaged 9.8%;&#13;
during 1980-90 it averaged 5.8% and during 1990-94 it averaged 3.7% per annum. There have&#13;
also been a number of atypical years characterized by negative or zero growth due to power&#13;
rationing, such as 1981 and 1992/93. The latter explains the low growth rate during the last four&#13;
years, the reason being that, after a period of significant power cuts, demand does not recuperate&#13;
because substitution practices (including backup generation), as well as conservation habits,&#13;
become permanent.&#13;

2.    Market Structure: Final demand for electricity has remained relatively stable during the&#13;
past decade, with predominantly residential sales (48%), followed by the industrial (30%) and&#13;
commercial (10%) subsectors, as shown in Table 6-2. Losses exhibited an increasing trend until&#13;
1988 when they reached a maximum of 24%. Since then there have been efforts to curb them, but&#13;
they have only succeeded in reducing them to around 20%.&#13;
3.    Forecast of Future Power Sales. The principal variables influencing power sector&#13;
demand are:&#13;
* Population growth and service coverage;&#13;
* Economic growth&#13;
*  Electricity prices and tariff policy&#13;
*  The supply of substitutes&#13;
Regarding these factors, the outlook as of 1995 appears as follows:&#13;
(a)    Service coverage by electricity utilities is estimated to be around 70-75%; this&#13;
percentage is not expected to increase significantly in the near future as extending&#13;
service to currently isolated communities is not economical (these areas may have&#13;
electricity service from local generation),&#13;
(b)   Economic growth is expected to fluctuate between 5% and 6.3% between 1995&#13;
and 2010;&#13;
(c)    Prices for electricity are expected to increase, and current plans are to reach&#13;
economic cost levels by 1997;&#13;
(d)   Substitutes are expected to exert a major influence on electricity growth: on one&#13;
hand, electricity price increases will induce its substitution by lower price and cost&#13;
alternatives (LPG, natural gas) and, on the other, increases in the supply of natural&#13;
gas and the construction of pipelines to major urban centers which have hitherto&#13;
lacked this service will require the development of a significant market to justify&#13;
these investments; this can be expected to lead to an aggressive marketing&#13;
approach that would impact the electricity market,&#13;
(e)    Expected reductions in losses will also exert a moderating influence in demand: by&#13;
legalizing connections and detecting theft, consumers can be expected to moderate&#13;
their consumption;&#13;
(f)    Finally, energy conservation programs can also be expected to reduce demand&#13;
growth&#13;

4.     The Policy Unit of the Ministry of Mines and Energy, UPME, has the responsibility for overseeing&#13;
the energy sector's evolution. In order to structure the indicative expansion plan, it developed a sector-&#13;
wide approach for structuring overall energy projections. The first phase of this study was executed&#13;
during the first half of 1994; its methodology is based on econometric models together with analytic&#13;
models which are combined to produce integrated energy projections.&#13;
5.     Three scenarios were considered for projecting electricity demand during 1995-2007 which&#13;
depend on (a) the degree of penetration of natural gas; (b) the adjustment of electricity prices; (c)&#13;
economic development; and (d) energy conservation and demand management programs. Table 6-3&#13;
summarizes the assumptions and results obtained under the three demand scenarios.&#13;

Average prices evolve as approved in 1995 by the social pact; cost levels are reached in 1998.&#13;
2 Residential prices reach the target cost in 2000; thereafter they do not grow in real ternns&#13;
3 Other sub scctors have already reached the target cost level&#13;
4 The change in the growth rate is explained by the change in pricing increases and a stabilization in natural gas growth.&#13;
6.     The assumptions underlying the projections were analyzed during appraisal. The estimated&#13;
growth rates for the economy largely coincide with the Bank's projections and the overall approach to&#13;
estimating future demand is based on sound principles. The results yield higher growth rates than those&#13;
observed during the last decade. On one hand, the strong expected economic performance will provide a&#13;
demand-stimulating factor given that the income elasticity of demand is greater than unity; on the other&#13;
hand, there is a major element of uncertainty related to the substitution of electricity by natural gas. The&#13;
latter, characterized by its low cost and its environmentally friendly characteristics is likely to be widely&#13;
sought after by consumers, even at the current price levels; this incentive is likely to intensify with the&#13;
expected readjustment of electricity prices. The base case scenario assumes a gradual substitution of&#13;
natural gas for electricity, and in this aspect is a conservative scenario.&#13;

ANNEX 7&#13;
COLOMBIA&#13;
POWER MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
INDICATIVE EXPANSION PLAN&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The Electricity Law approved in July, 1994 as well as the Domiciliary Public Services Law assign&#13;
the Government the responsibility for assuring adequate supplies of electricity by taking measures to&#13;
prevent major disruptions.&#13;
2.    In the context of a market-driven development, this responsibility consists of foreseeing the&#13;
generation and transmission requirements of the electricity sector, following-up the development of new&#13;
facilities determining the need for additional incentives to the private sector and, ultimately, taking&#13;
corrective action directly to prevent rationing on a large scale.&#13;
3.    The objective of the indicative expansion plan is to respond to these requirements by (a) informing&#13;
investors on desirable resources to be developed, including their location, size and timing, (b) informing&#13;
Government of potential risks regarding supply disruptions; and (c) identifying the decision agenda&#13;
regarding projects to be promoted through private sector investment as well as those that require&#13;
decisions from Public Sector agencies.&#13;
4.    The responsibility for developing the indicative expansion plan was assigned to the Policy Unit&#13;
(UPME2). Given that this function had been executed in the past by Interconexi6n Electrica, and that the&#13;
expertise regarding the structure of expansion plans was concentrated in that company, UPME delegated&#13;
to ISA this responsibility in 1993; in the 1994/95 revision of the plan, ISA has continued to execute a&#13;
major proportion of the plan with the help of UPME.&#13;
The 1993 Expansion Plan&#13;
5.    The first plan executed under the new institutional arrangement can be briefly summarized as&#13;
follows:&#13;
*  It assumed a growth rate for electricity demand within the 4.2%-4.7% range (see annex 6&#13;
electricity demand);&#13;
*  For 1995-2000 it identified the need for a total of 1950MW of new generation distributed&#13;
between 750MW in gas-based plants, 450MW in coal plants and 750MW of hydro generation;&#13;
2Unidad de Planeacion Minero Energetica&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
* For 2001-2004 it identified 2050NMW of which 1200MW would be gas-based, 150MW coal&#13;
and 700MW hydro.&#13;
6.    The plan exhibits the following progress:&#13;
* 742MW net additions of gas-based generation are under development with private sector&#13;
participation (ABB and ENRON in Termobarranquilla and Termovalle, respectively);&#13;
*  15OMW coal-based generation has been awarded to a private consortium (Paipa IV);&#13;
*  The Porce II hydro project is under construction by EPM;&#13;
*  The Urra I hydro is under construction and is expected to start operating towards the end of&#13;
1999;&#13;
*  The Miel I hydro project was launched and a consortium was formed to build it.&#13;
The 1994/95 Update&#13;
7.    The 1993 plan was updated in 1994/95 in order to (a) extend the planning horizon to 2007 and&#13;
(b) take into account revised demand growth which is expected to be in the 5-6% range for the near and&#13;
medium future.&#13;
8.    Both the 1993 plan and the 1994/95 were structured in order to provide an energy supply&#13;
reliability of 95%, i.e. the plan assures that the variations in runoff would lead to a disruption of supplies&#13;
in 5% or less of the available hydrological simulation sequences. In order to accomplish this, the update&#13;
confirms the need for reinforcing the thermal component of the system in order to manage possible&#13;
drought conditions, and in particular those arising with the so-called "El Nino" phenomenon.&#13;
9.    For the 1995-2000 period, the update recommends an additional 700MW in thermal plants which&#13;
were identified as 400MW gas-based and 300MW coal-based (which corresponds to the Termocesar coal&#13;
plant recommended in the previous plan). This plan was endorsed by CONPES in February, 1995. The&#13;
principal action to be taken consists of identifying sponsors and investors for the 400MW thermal plants.&#13;
The Termocesar plant feasibility is expected to be contracted by ISAGEN.&#13;
10.   The private sector has so far responded aggressively to the new opportunities: there are at present&#13;
22 consortia which have expressed their interest in developing a total of 1700MW to 2600MW in thermal&#13;
and hydro plants. The range of these proposals varies from 10MW in small hydro to 100-500MW&#13;
proposals by both major energy companies and large industrial Colombian conglomerates.&#13;
Il.   For the longer term (2001-2007), the decision agenda calls for furthering studies related to five&#13;
possible hydro plants; the hydro capacity to be installed during this period is on the order of 1200MW to&#13;
150OMW. Given the construction time required for these plants, further studies are required in order to&#13;
make a decision to proceed with their construction and to initiate their promotion in 1996-97.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
12.   Regarding transmission expansion, the major developments include the reinforcements between&#13;
the Central region and the Southwest and the new interconnection between the Atlantic region and the&#13;
Northeast, i.e. the principal investment component of the project being financed by the Bank.&#13;
13.   The cost of new projects in the proposed expansion plan for the 1995-2007 period has an&#13;
expected present value of US$4.6 billion at December, 1994 price levels.&#13;
14.   The plan was reviewed and its assumptions and conclusions were considered to be adequate by&#13;
the Appraisal Mission.&#13;

COLOMBIA&#13;
POWER MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE POWER SECTOR&#13;
1.    This annex analyzes the Colombian power sector's past financial performance and its expected&#13;
performance during project implementation. Section A describes the financial situation of the power&#13;
sector during 1984-1990, before the implementation of the power sector reform program. Section B&#13;
summarizes the actions taken by the government during 1991-1994. Section C assesses the financial&#13;
prospects of the power sector during 1995-2003.&#13;
A. Financial Performance During 1984-90&#13;
2.    This period is characterized by a considerable deterioration of the sector's finances due to (a)&#13;
slow tariff increases which did not keep up with inflation; (b) large increases in debt service due to plant&#13;
overbuilding in the early 1980s; (c) periods of strong devaluation which further increased the already&#13;
heavy burden of dollar-denominated debts; and (d) increased inefficiency due to administrative, financial,&#13;
and commercial mnismanagement.&#13;

3.    Prior to 1984, the power sector was heavily subsidized and tariffs did not reflect costs. During&#13;
1980-84, average tariffs charged to final customers covered only about 50% to 60% of marginal costs&#13;
and induced over consumption and waste. This low tariff level extended from the bulk level to the retail&#13;
level during the 1984-90 period. In 1986, only 82% of average marginal costs were covered. Although&#13;
the average tariff applied to final customers increased by 15% during the period, the retail tariff for each&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
utility was not uniform, and, depending on market composition, average prices varied considerably from&#13;
one company to another, as shown in figure 8. 13. Most of the variation can be explained because the&#13;
subsidized residential tariff was considerably below the overpriced commercial and industrial tariffs;&#13;
consequently, distribution utilities with large numbers of residential customers were worse off than others.&#13;
In 1990, the average tariff applied to final customers ranged between 3.7 and 6.8 UScent/kWh at 1''93&#13;
price levels.&#13;
4.    As a result of the rapid growth in power generation and distribution over the past twenty years,&#13;
the power utilities incurred significant amounts of external debt to fuind new investments as shown in&#13;
Table 8.1. The consolidated indebtedness of the power sector amounted to about US$5.2 billion in 1990,&#13;
of which US$2.9 billion was foreign debt and US$2.3 billion was internal debt. Consolidated intemal&#13;
cash generation of the power sector was insufficient to finance the corresponding debt service for 1990,&#13;
which was partially financed with government contributions (see Table 8.2). In 1990, Government&#13;
contributions were mainly used to finance guaranteed external debt totaling about US$130 million. It&#13;
was also used to pay arrears from distributors due to energy purchased from ISA and to partially finance&#13;
ICEL and CORELCA's investment program.&#13;

5. The rapid devaluation of the Colombian peso with respect to the dollar which took place between&#13;
1982 and 1986, together with low price levels which were not adjusted in line either with inflation or the&#13;
devaluation, severely impacted the sector's financial position whose long-term debt was denominated in&#13;
foreign currency.&#13;
6.    The lack of corporate accountability and autonomy in most of the utilities led to a deterioration of&#13;
administrative, financial, and commercial practices. Power losses were out of control and ranged between&#13;
14% and 32% in 1990. Arrears of energy bills from distributors to generators, and from government&#13;
agencies and private customers to distributors exceeded 6 months in most utilities.&#13;
7.     rable 8.3 summarizes the financial performance of the utilities during 1984-90. The utilities have&#13;
been grouped into three categories: (a) large companies (with total assets in excess of US$700 million),&#13;
which include most of the generation utilities; (b) small power utilities, which were profitable and solvent&#13;
at the end of 1990; and (c) small power utilities (mainly ICEL and CORELCA subsidiaries), which were&#13;
unprofitable and insolvent at the end of 1990.&#13;

8.    The first group represents 81% of total power sector assets, and includes the main&#13;
generation and distribution utilities. Of these, CORELCA, ICEL, CVC and CHB exhibit a&#13;
deteriorating trend during 1984-1990. Net income was negative, debt service coverage was lower&#13;
than 0.7, and the debt/assets ratio was higher than 60/40. ISA's net cash generation was also&#13;
negative due to the heavy load of its debt service. The second group, which accounts for 11 % of&#13;
total power sector assets, had a satisfactory financial situation. The third group, with about 8% of&#13;
the power sector assets, had an unsatisfactory financial situation. Net income and net cash&#13;
generation were negative. Most of these distribution companies were more than 13 months in&#13;
arrears in payment of the energy purchased from generation utilities. Their accounts receivable&#13;
ranged between 66 days and 400 days; many of the clients in arrears were government agencies&#13;
(water companies, hospitals, schools, government offices, etc.) whose debts are difficult to collect&#13;
as power cannot be readily cut off without giving rise to social and political conflicts.&#13;
B. Financial Performance During 1991-94&#13;
9.    As part of its 1991 adjustment program, the Government defined a long-term strategy to&#13;
improve efficiency and to rehabilitate the power utilities' finances. This strategy aimed at: (a)&#13;
establishing a rational tariff structure and rate level; (b) setting the utilities on a sound financial&#13;
footing; and (c) increasing their efficiency.&#13;
10.   Tariff Adjustment. Tariffs charged to final customers maintained an increasing trend&#13;
during this period. This adjustment was particularly important in dollar terms as the rate of&#13;
devaluation of the Colombian peso during 1991-94 was considerably lower than the rate of&#13;
inflation (and lower than the rate of increase in electricity prices). During this period, the&#13;
government made changes to the level and tariff structure in order to reflect economic costs and&#13;
to reduce subsidies to residential customers. By the end of 1994, the average electricity price&#13;
applied to final customers ranged between 6.0 and 10.0 UScent/kWh and the sector's average&#13;
tariff was estimated to cover around 90% of LRMC.&#13;
11.   Financial Rehabilitation. By far the most important step toward the implementation of&#13;
the Government's strategy was the debt relief granted by the National Government to the large&#13;
power utilities in exchange for assets and equity shares. This was made through a number of&#13;
financial operations which consisted of:&#13;
(a)    A Debt/Equity Swap. In October 1991, the Government increased its&#13;
participation in Interconexi6n E1ectrica's equity, through capitalization of&#13;
US$342.3 million owed by the utilities to Interconexi6n Electrica, and by&#13;
US$318.5 million owed by Interconexi6n Eldctrica to the Government. As a result&#13;
of this operation, debt service was reduced, and the Government became&#13;
Interconexi6n E1ectrica's main stockholder. Table 8.4. summarizes the financial&#13;
operation:&#13;

(b)    A Debt/Asset Swap. In 1992, the Government implemented measures to improve&#13;
the financial situation of CORELCA, CHB, ICEL, and CVC. The Government&#13;
took charge of these utilities' foreign debt and canceled other debts amounting to&#13;
about US$1.1 billion, as shown in Table 8.5. In return, the Government received&#13;
operating assets for the same amount (Termocartagena - 220MW, Termotasajero -&#13;
150MW, and Termopalenque V - 20MW, among others).&#13;

12.    In 1992, the Government also defined a strategy to improve the financial situation of&#13;
ICEL's and CORELCA's subsidiaries (electrificadoras). This strategy included the implementatiori&#13;
of:&#13;
(a)     a plan to alleviate the short- and medium-term financial situation of the&#13;
electrificadoras. Arrears due to energy purchased by the electrificadoras to ICEL&#13;
4Resolutions #153 and #121, dated 11.4.93 and 10.13.94, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
(US$76 million) and CORELCA (US$125 million) were refinanced through long-&#13;
term debts, with a maturity between 20 and 30 years, 4 years grace period, and 5%&#13;
and 10% interest rate;&#13;
(b)   a mechanism to transfer subsidies to the electrificadoras through budget&#13;
appropriations in order to cover the deficit resulting from the supply of electricity&#13;
to low income residential users at below-cost tariffs. This budget allocation&#13;
amounted to about US$89 million during 1992-94.&#13;
13.   Performance Contracts. These contracts were signed between the Government (through&#13;
the Consejo Superior de Politica Fiscal and FEN), and all those utilities profiting from&#13;
government loans and guarantees. The contracts set: (i) limits to the intervention of the Board in&#13;
the utility; (ii) specific corporate targets; and (iii) administrative, commercial and financial&#13;
performance targets to managers. In turn, the Government provides financial support through&#13;
budget allocations. Lack of compliance with the committed objectives would cause disbursement&#13;
suspension, credit accelerations, and firing of managers. 25 performance contracts5were signed&#13;
during 1992 and 1993, and 20 of them induced a positive recovery, which resulted in net income&#13;
and profit increases (see Table 8.6). Although these performance contracts will contribute to&#13;
improve the utilities' financial situation, further actions are required to solve the problem and to&#13;
improve management and ownership responsiveness.&#13;
It does not include ICEL, which was re-structured and re-oriented, nor EADE, whose contract was&#13;
amended in 1994.&#13;

C. Forecast Financial Situation for 1995-2003&#13;
14.   As a result of the re-structuring reform initiated by the Government in 1991, the prospects&#13;
for the power sector have changed radically:&#13;
* Bulk electricity prices have been deregulated, thereby introducing an element that will&#13;
pressure final user prices to be adjusted accordingly;&#13;
* A regulatory commission is in charge of setting regulated prices; although the Commission has&#13;
Government officials sitting on it, it also has independent regulators who outnumber the&#13;
former and can prevent tariff erosion;&#13;
* The Domiciliary Public Services Law mandates that prices be adjusted to cost levels within the&#13;
next five years, thereby pressuring the Government to maintain the real level of electricity&#13;
prices; it also mandates that Government agencies include provisions in their budgets for&#13;
paying public service bills, thereby helping to keep electricity companies' receivable under&#13;
control;&#13;
* The Government has recognized that allowing the sector to deteriorate financially, as in the&#13;
1980s, leads ultimately to project delays, neglect in equipment maintenance, costly bailouts&#13;
and, eventually, power cuts; and&#13;
* In accordance with the principles set out in the Public Services Law, the Government has&#13;
effectively appropriated National Budget funds to finance the subsidies it awards certain&#13;
categories of residential customers, thereby facing a tradeoff between allowing tariffs to be&#13;
adjusted or imposing greater pressure on the Budget.&#13;
15.   The financial performance of the power sector as whole for 1995-2003 is expected to be&#13;
satisfactory. Table 8.7 summarizes the forecast financial performance of the utilities during 1994-&#13;
2003. Projected tariffs were gradually adjusted to reflect economic costs, as indicated by the&#13;
regulatory commission's guidelines and targets. Despite the overall satisfactory performance, the&#13;
results are not uniform. In order to analyze them, the utilities have been grouped into four&#13;
categories, as follows:&#13;
(a)    Large generation and distribution companies. This group includes ISAGEN,&#13;
EPM, EPSA, CHB, EEB, and CORELCA, whose projected financial performance&#13;
is generally good, except for the last two utilities. EEB and CORELCA show a&#13;
weak financial situation in the short and medium term, with a positive trend&#13;
towards recuperation. EEB has a heavy debt service due to the construction of&#13;
Guavio, which will become progressively lighter. CORELCA would need&#13;
additional financing of about US$700 million (including the corresponding&#13;
financial cost) to cover its debt service and investments due to the operation of&#13;
new independent producers (such as PROELECTRICA and eventually the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
Termocartagena and Las Flores plants if they are privatized) which would&#13;
participate in the bulk power market, thereby displacing CORELCA's sales.&#13;
(b)    Small power utilities, which are expected to be profitable and solvent during&#13;
the period. These utilities present an improving financial trend durinrg the periu6.&#13;
Most of the utilities have a strong tariff structure and an acceptable administrative&#13;
management. This group also includes some utilities (Magdalena, Cesar, and&#13;
Guajira), which in spite of having had financial problems during 1984-90, are&#13;
expected to recover during the period.&#13;
(c)    Small power utilities under financial recovery during the period. This group&#13;
includes utilities having financial difficulties only during the first three years. These&#13;
companies, which account for about 4% of the sector's net fixed assets,&#13;
deteriorated during 1991-94 with the exception of SUCRE (see Tables 8.3 and&#13;
8.6). The financial recovery of BOY'ACA, SUCRE and CAQUETA is partially due&#13;
to the enforcement of a performance contract signed in 1992; EADE entered into a&#13;
performance contract only in 1994.&#13;
(d)    Small power utilities with scarce hope of becoming either profitable or&#13;
solvent. This group includes utilities with a predominantly residential market&#13;
structure of low income customers. They account for around 2% of the sector's&#13;
net fixed assets and about 4% of total supply. Electrificadora de Bolivar recently&#13;
lost most of its industrial customers to Proel6ctrica, an independent private&#13;
generator; Choc6, Narino, and CEDELCA serve mainly rural customers.&#13;

16.    National Budget Appropriations. The financial vulnerability of weak distribution&#13;
companies is expected to persist as long as (a) the policy of subsidizing low income users is&#13;
maintained and (b) their market structure in terms of residential/commercial/industrial users does&#13;
not change. Therefore, they can be expected to require continued Government support. For&#13;
1995, the budgeted support for the sector amounts to Col$60 billion (US$70 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
79 -&#13;
7.   The issue consists of determining the appropriate amount of Government subsidy which is&#13;
required by these companies; it can be examined under two alternative approaches:&#13;
*  By quantifying subsidies (positive or negative) as the difference between prices and&#13;
LRMC and by calculating the net subsidies lil ;lie sector and for each company- of&#13;
*  By recognizing that equating prices and LRMC is a condition for efficiency but not a&#13;
condition for financial equilibrium and by setting Government contributions at a level&#13;
that compensates utilities according to the financial shortfall associated with residential&#13;
subsidies.&#13;
18.   The first approach provides an upper bound to the subsidies required by any given&#13;
distribution company by comparing actual prices to the LRMC:&#13;
Under the existing tariff schedules (1995), required subsidies amount to Col$ 240&#13;
billion, and cross subsidies generate Col$ 192 billion for a net requirement of Col$ 48&#13;
billion (US$176 million);&#13;
*  Under the planned targeted subsidies, there would be a gross requirement of Col$ 47&#13;
billion and cross-subsidies of Col$ 60 billion for a net excess of Col$ 13 billion&#13;
(US$15 million).&#13;
Consequently, under planned tariff adjustments, overall cross-subsidies are expected to exceed&#13;
subsidies to lower income users. However the net position is positive for only six out of 29&#13;
distribution companies; as a consequence, 23 companies would still require support amounting to&#13;
Col $ 47 billion (US$56 million). The financial subsidy required from Government once prices&#13;
reach the level targeted by the regulatory commission is relatively modest and will amount to less&#13;
than 5% of the sector's revenues.&#13;
19.   The second approach recognizes that equating prices and LRMC is neither a necessary nor&#13;
a sufficient condition of financial equilibrium; the existing average tariff level, on the order of 90%&#13;
of LRMC, can generate sufficient funds for distribution companies to operate adequately,&#13;
particularly when facing decreasing returns to scale.&#13;
20.   Furthermore, many of the problems faced by the distribution utilities also originate in weak&#13;
management; in this sense, the most pressing problem consists of controlling losses which amount&#13;
to around 20% of generation. It is estimated that at least 10% correspond to unbilled&#13;
consumption and reducing them should increase revenues significantly.&#13;
21.   Sensitivity Analysis. The following scenarios were assumed:&#13;
(a)    An increase of 3 and I percentage points in local and external inflation&#13;
respectively, over the level of the base case. There is no appreciable effect in sector&#13;
finance, due to the following factors: (i) revenues and most of the expenses are&#13;
adjusted with inflation; (ii) external inflation has only an effect on large companies,&#13;
whose investment programs have a foreign component, and who have the capacity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
to obtain new loans; (iii) smaller companies who only have distribution investments&#13;
in local currency exhibit cash surpluses under this scenario;&#13;
(b)   Local inflation identical to that used in the base case, and external inflation&#13;
according to the Bank's OP 6.50 Annex B 1 (October, 1994) (annual inflation&#13;
increases of 1.5% in 1995, 1.8% in 1996, 2.6% in 1997, 2.5% in 1998-2001, 2.4%&#13;
in 2002, and 2.1% in 2003). This scenario shows a decrease of about US$100&#13;
million in investment requirements due to the reduction of the foreign component&#13;
of the investment program of large power utilities.&#13;
D. Assumptions For Power Sector Financial Projections&#13;
General&#13;
22.   Financial projections for the period 1994-2003 have been prepared by FEN in current&#13;
prices and are expressed in US$ million. Expected inflation and exchange rates are detailed in the&#13;
following table:&#13;

23.   The forecast was based on the following main assumptions:&#13;
Item                                  Assumption&#13;
Energy Sales     Energy sales are based on the demand projections used in the Preference&#13;
Generation and Transmission Expansion Plan of 1995. It considered an&#13;
average 6.1% sales growth during the period, assuming a reduction of&#13;
power losses from 23% in 1994 to 19% in 2000 over net power&#13;
generation.&#13;
Power Sector     The power revenues of each utility are based on existing tariffs in 1993&#13;
Tariff           Tariffs projected for the period were increased in accordance with the&#13;
resolutions issued by JNT and ERC for 1994 and maintained constant in&#13;
real terms. For 1995, sector tariff increases were set at 18% according to&#13;
resolution #057 of December 1994, and take into account the policy set in&#13;
the Pacto Social implemented by the current Government. lTotal increases&#13;
in real terms during 1996-2000 for the four largest distribution companies&#13;
in the sector were assumed as: EEB (2.3%), EPM (13%), EMCALI&#13;
(7.9%) and Electrificadora del Atlantico (-2.8%); increases for the&#13;
remaining distribution companies ranged between 10% and 20% with the&#13;
exception of Magdalena (-6%) and Caqueta (57%).&#13;
Energy           Transmission tariffs are based on the ERC's resolution #001 and #004 of&#13;
Purchased by     December 1994, which sets wheeling charges applied to distributors.&#13;
the Distribution   These tariffs were maintained constant in real terms during the period.&#13;
Utilities        The tariff to be paid to the generators is based on ERC's resolutions #010&#13;
to #030, and was set as the average tariff paid the distributors less toll&#13;
tariff.&#13;
Investment       New generation is assumed to be installed by lhe private sector. Current&#13;
Program          investment in generation only includes the completion of existing projects.&#13;

COLOMBIA&#13;
POWER MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT DESCRIPTION, COSTS AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
A. Purpose&#13;
1.    This Annex contains the Project Implementation Plan (PIP). The PIP details the project&#13;
management and implementation arrangements, and is referenced in the loan documents. The PIP&#13;
addresses the principal features of the project: scope and objectives, costs, implementation&#13;
arrangements, implementation schedule and procurement and disbursement schedules. The PIP&#13;
will be the basic reference for ISA's management for measuring progress and success in project&#13;
implementation. The PIP will also provide the reference benchmarks for Bank supervision of the&#13;
project's components.&#13;
2.    Given the large number of components of the Project, the PIP is a summary of a more&#13;
detailed document prepared by ISA and the Bank during project appraisal which is available in the&#13;
project file (3 Project Implementation Plan, Spanish Version). This document details the above&#13;
features for each of the sub-components of the Project and would be used for reference as&#13;
appropriate, during project implementation.&#13;
B. Project Objectives and Description&#13;
3.    The project's overall objective is to support power sector reform by facilitating the&#13;
operation of a competitive bulk supply market for electricity. Specifically, the project seeks to lift&#13;
transmission constraints that hinder an open access of publicly as well as privately owned power&#13;
generators to the grid and to support ISA in its role as transmission network operator, system&#13;
generation dispatcher and commercial transactions coordinator. The project will be a key&#13;
component of the comprehensive power sector restructuring that is being put in place with Bank&#13;
assistance.&#13;
4.    The project consists of three components:&#13;
PART A: Energy Control Center (ECC) and Financial Settlement Center (FSC).&#13;
5.    This component includes the upgrading of the data acquisition and control functions of&#13;
ISA's existing ECC and the installation of a FSC. The project will finance the purchase of&#13;
measurement, data acquisition, telecommunications, data processing equipment and software.&#13;

PART C: Technical Assistance:&#13;
7.    This part includes the provision of consulting services and training programs to assist ISA&#13;
in the strengthening of its capabilities to assume its roles of: (i) transmission network operator, (ii)&#13;
power dispatch coordinator and (iii) bulk electricity transaction clearing house. These activities&#13;
will be agreed upon between ISA and the Bank subject to an annual plan to be approved by the&#13;
Bank. An initial list of studies and training activities for the first year of execution is presented&#13;
below:&#13;
Studies:&#13;
(a)   Final design and technical specification for computing and data acquisition systems&#13;
and the corresponding software for the ECC and the FSC;&#13;
(b)   Determination and specification of methods to transmit data collected by remote&#13;
meters to the ECC and the FSC;&#13;

(c)   Telecommunications;&#13;
(d)   Environmental impact assessment and monitoring of power transmission lines;&#13;
(e)   Marketing;&#13;
(f)    Power transmission contract negotiation.&#13;
C. Project Cost&#13;
8.    Two different sets of project costs were developed during appraisal: one, in accordance to&#13;
Bank rules for presentation in SARs, the other based on ISA's accounting practices for easy&#13;
follow up of the project execution. The differences are in the treatment of the foreign cost&#13;
component, and the assumptions for estimating physical and price contingencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
86&#13;
9.    Cost Estimate in Accordance with Bank Rules. This cost estimate for the project is&#13;
summarized in Table 1, and is identical to the one included in the main text of this report. The&#13;
project's total cost including taxes, duties, physical contingencies, price contingencies and interest&#13;
during construction is estimated at US$ 410.0 million, of which US$ 249.3 million (60%)&#13;
corresponds to direct plus indirect foreign costs and US$ 170.1 million (40%) corresponds to&#13;
local costs. Taxes and import duties are estimated at US$43.9 million. Cost estimates are in&#13;
December 1994 prices.&#13;
10.   Costs are based on ISA's estimates, which have been reviewed by the Bank and found&#13;
acceptable. ISA maintains a database of transmission and substation costs with similar&#13;
characteristics to those of the project; it was updated during project preparation on the basis of&#13;
recent international bids for similar projects. Physical contingencies, which amount on average to&#13;
12%, were estimated based upon the type of project and the status of its design. Price&#13;
contingencies assume: (a) a project execution period of six years based on the 1994 Bank&#13;
standard disbursement schedule for power projects in LAC, and (b) escalation rates over and&#13;
above base cost plus physical contingencies of 2.6% for 1995-2001.&#13;

11.   Project Cost Adjustment for Purposes of Supervision. For purposes of project&#13;
implementation, the appraisal team and ISA worked on the basis of costs estimates which can be&#13;
easily supervised and monitored during project implementation. Such data should be consistent&#13;
with ISA accounting procedures, which include as foreign component only direct imports of&#13;
materials, equipment and consulting and contractor services, (expenditures directly done by ISA&#13;
in foreign currency), while the table presented in the SAR considers foreign component also the&#13;
indirect foreign costs (the import component embodied in goods and services which are provided&#13;
domestically). On the above basis, the project's total cost, including duties, taxes, price&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
88&#13;
contingencies and interest during construction is estimated at US$ 397.4 million, of which US$&#13;
236.7 million corresponds to direct only foreign costs and US$ 160.7 million corresponds to&#13;
local costs. Physical contingencies weighting, in average 10% has been estimated by ISA in&#13;
accordance with its own internal procedures. Price contingencies assume: (a) a project execution&#13;
based on ISA's detailed schedule for each one of the components of the project, and (b)&#13;
escalation rates over and above base cost plus physical contingencies in accordance with&#13;
guidelines provided to ISA by DINP. It was assumed that the exchange rate variations would&#13;
compensate for the difference between the local and international inflation rates. Total project&#13;
cost is summarized in Table 2.&#13;

D. Financing&#13;
On the basis of Table 1, total required financing is estimated at US$ 410.0 million. A Bank loan&#13;
of US$ 249.3 million is proposed to cover the foreign currency component. Local financing,&#13;
amounting at US$ 160.7 million, would be provided by ISA's own cash generation (see Financial&#13;
Analysis).&#13;

E. Implementation Arrangements&#13;
12.   The project will be implemented by ISA. ISA has long experience and has performed well&#13;
in implementing Bank financed projects. Implementation of the project would be the&#13;
responsibility of a Project Executing Unit (PEU) under the Transmission Directorate. The PEU is&#13;
well staffed with experienced professionals and has enough resources and autonomy to seek&#13;
consultant support whenever this is needed. The Project Execution Unit has successfully carried&#13;
out several projects financed by loans from the Bank and IDB and has proven good&#13;
implementation capabilities.&#13;
13.    ISA will require support from specialized consultants for developing specific tasks, as&#13;
follows: Part A of the Project: ISA has procured and will finance with its own resources the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
91&#13;
participation of a specialized consulting firm for completing the feasibility study and the&#13;
preparation of bidding documents for the implementation of the ECC and the FSC. Part B of the&#13;
Project: ISA will procure, in accordance with the procurement schedule, several contracts for&#13;
design and supervision during construction for lines and substations to be implemented under this&#13;
component. Most of consultant contracts will be locally procured and financed with ISA's own&#13;
funds. Part C of the Project. Under the TA component of the Project, ISA will contract under&#13;
procedures acceptable to the Bank and with bank financing several consultant contracts as&#13;
indicated in the procurement schedule.&#13;
14.   The PEU's specific activities covers the following:&#13;
*  preparation of terms of reference, solicitation of proposals, contractual arrangements and&#13;
supervision of consultant work for studies, design and inspection of works&#13;
(manufacturer's tests for equipment and supervision of construction and erection of lines&#13;
and substations),&#13;
*  preparation and solicitation of bids for procurement of equipment and materials,&#13;
*  preparation and solicitation of proposals for construction of civil works and for the&#13;
erection of electromechanical equipment,&#13;
*  organization and procurement of certification of acceptance tests and commissioning,&#13;
*  follow up of Project budget and management of disbursement applications,&#13;
*  intemal reporting to ISA's management and to ISA's internal audit system,&#13;
*  follow up of implementation of environmental programs,&#13;
*  external reporting (IDB, IBRD, FEN, MME, others).&#13;
15.   The PEU is organized along functional groups as shown in Schedule 1.&#13;
F. Implementation Schedule&#13;
16.   In accordance with the aggregate schedule of the various components of the project,&#13;
execution is expected to be completed by the end 1999. ISA's official execution schedule is&#13;
presented in Schedule 2.&#13;
17.   Procurement arrangements for the proposed project are summarized in Table 2 2.&#13;
Purchase of goods and equipment and contracting of construction works to be financed with&#13;
'ISA is exempted from application of Law 80, which regulates contracts involving public entities, in respect to all&#13;
aspects of Project execution, including procurement. (See Annex 1, Electricity Law.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
92&#13;
proceeds of the loan would be carried out in accordance with the Bank procurement guidelines,&#13;
Bank Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995).&#13;
Purchases of goods and equipment for transmission lines and substations for a total of US$129.0&#13;
million would be procured under Intemational Competitive Bidding (ICB). Computers and other&#13;
electronic equipment for implementing the ECC and FSC for a total amount of US$ 12.3 million&#13;
would be procured through Limited International Bidding (LIB) because there is only a limited&#13;
number of potential suppliers. Works for construction of transmission lines and substations for a&#13;
total of US$3 1.0 would be procured under ICB. Equipment and installation services for&#13;
substations and transmission lines for a total amount of US$50.0 million would be procured under&#13;
ICB. Procurement of consultant services for a total amount of US$5.0 million will be carried out&#13;
in accordance with the Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August 1981). An&#13;
aggregate amount of US$1.0 million would be used to reimburse foreign expenditures incurred by&#13;
ISA in its training abroad of ISA staff, such as tuition fees and travel expenses for attending&#13;
courses and seminars. Bank issued standard bidding documents would be used for all&#13;
procurement of goods and works. For complex time-based consulting assignments Bank issued&#13;
standard form of contract for consulting services will be used. To expedite procurement, an initial&#13;
list of procurement packages was agreed with ISA and is presented as Attachment 3&#13;
(Procurement Schedule). Procurement packages under ICB arrangements would be about 30&#13;
with an average cost of about US$ 7.4 million, a minimum cost of US$ 1.0 million and a&#13;
maximum cost of about US$ 38 million. There would also be about 50 locally procured packages&#13;
not financed by the Bank with an average cost of about US$500,000; these packages are not&#13;
likely to attract foreign bidders and local procurement is considered to be the most efficient&#13;
procedure. Goods and services not financed with proceeds of the loan would be procured locally&#13;
under ISA's established procurement practices, which have been reviewed by the Bank and found&#13;
to be satisfactory.&#13;

training (other than consultant services) equal or exceeding US$ 300,000 would be subject to the&#13;
Bank's prior review. The provisions of the Consultant Guidelines requiring prior Bank review or&#13;
approval of budgets, short lists, selection procedures, letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation&#13;
reports and contracts, shall not apply to: (a) contracts for the employment of consulting firms&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent each; or (b) contracts for the employment of&#13;
individuals estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent each. However, said exceptions to&#13;
prior Bank review shall not apply to: (a) the terms of reference for such contracts; (b) single-&#13;
source selection of consulting firms; (c) assignments of a critical nature, as reasonably determined&#13;
by the Bank; (d) amendments to contracts for the employment of consulting firms raising the&#13;
contract value to US$100,000 equivalent or above; or (e) amendments to contracts for the&#13;
employment of individual consultants raising the contract value to US$50,000 equivalent or&#13;
above. Contracts subject to prior review would cover about 85% of Bank financed goods and&#13;
services. The balance of contracts would be subject to ex-post review by the Bank after contracts&#13;
are awarded. When evaluating bids for goods, qualified domestic manufacturers would be eligible&#13;
for a 15% margin of preference, or the import duty, whichever is lower.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

19.   Disbursements. ISA expects to substantially complete project implementation in four&#13;
years, but the disbursements period should extend to six years. ISA expects to complete project&#13;
implementation in four years. However, under the 1994 standard disbursement profile for power&#13;
projects implemented in the LAC region, the loans would be disbursed over a seven years period.&#13;
The disbursement schedule is attached in Annex 10. Proceeds from the loans would be applied to&#13;
finance following estimated amounts of project expenditures:&#13;
(a)   90% of expenditures for works (US $25.0 million);&#13;
(b)    100% of foreign expenditures and 90% of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) for&#13;
the purchase of goods (US$ 10.0 million for part A of the Project and US$ 103.6&#13;
million for parts B and C of the Project;&#13;
(c)   95% of expenditures for contracts for the supply of equipment and installation&#13;
thereof (US$ 43.0 million);&#13;
(d)   100% of foreign expenditures for consultant services (US$ 0.5 million for part A&#13;
of the Project and US$ 4.5 million for parts B and C of the Project),&#13;
(e)    100% of foreign expenditures for training of ISA staff abroad and training fees&#13;
(US$ 1.0 million); and&#13;
(f)   interest and other charges under the Bank loan, (US$ 36.8 million);&#13;
(g)   unallocated expenditures (US$ 24.9 million).&#13;
20.   Disbursements against statement of expenses (SOE) will be made in respect of training&#13;
service contracts costing less than US$ 300,000 and for consultant services not subject to prior&#13;
review. Retroactive financing of up to US$ 10 million for eligible expenditures (made after&#13;
March 31, 1995, but no more than 12 months before signing) would be provided for under each&#13;
loan. Eligible expenditures would have to follow procurement procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. The Project is expected to be substantially completed by 2001 with a closing date of&#13;
December 31, 2002.&#13;
21.   The Borrower would establish for each loan Special Accounts in US dollars with a&#13;
commercial bank acceptable to the Bank to cover eligible Bank expenditures under the loan. The&#13;
authorized allocation to the Special Accounts would be US$8 million for each loan. However,&#13;
they should not exceed US$4 million during the start-up of the project. The balance could be&#13;
requested when the total amount disbursed from each loan account plus outstanding commitments&#13;
has reached US$20 million. Subsequent replenishment by the Bank into the Special Accounts&#13;
would follow the procedures by which Bank funds are disbursed against actual expenditures.&#13;
22.   Disbursements from the loan, in accordance with LAC's standard profile would be as&#13;
follow:&#13;

ANNEX 11&#13;
COLOMBIA&#13;
POWER MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
1.    The proposed project consists of three components: (a) Control Center upgrading to&#13;
support the sector's new institutional structure; (b) Expansion of the interconnected system to&#13;
allow ISA to accomplish its role of supporting a competitive generation-level market by allowing&#13;
energy transactions between generators and suppliers to take place; and (c) Technical Assistance&#13;
to ensure a good start and smooth operation of ISA in its new role.&#13;
2.    The economic analysis consists of:&#13;
* A cost-effectiveness analysis to verify that: (i) the project as a whole is part of the&#13;
sector least cost expansion plan, and (ii) its components are the least cost alternative&#13;
for accomplishing their objective; and&#13;
* An economic analysis which verifies that the resources used in the proposed&#13;
investments provide an acceptable economic rate of return.&#13;
Cost-effectiveness Analysis&#13;
3.    Expansion Plan. The Govemment recently approved a strategy for the 1995-2007&#13;
expansion of the power subsector'. The strategy is based on an updated expansion plan prepared&#13;
by MME and ISA in February, 1995; economic growth for 1995-2010 is assumed to vary within&#13;
the 5.13%-6.3% range depending on the scenario being examined, i.e. roughly within current&#13;
Bank projections which are in the 5.5%-6% range; electricity demand for these years is expected&#13;
to grow correspondingly at rates which range between 4.8% and 6.77% per annum. The&#13;
transmission lines and substations included in the project are part of the least cost expansion plan&#13;
and all components are needed in order to meet the desired reliability criteria.&#13;
4.    The following analysis verifies that the proposed investments are indeed the least cost&#13;
solution by comparing their costs and benefits with those of the next best alternatives. This&#13;
analysis was performed for the transmission components of the project (the San Carlos-&#13;
San Marcos System, and the La Loma-Copey and Paipa-Bucaramanga System) which account for&#13;
the bulk of the proposed investments. The Control Center and Technical Assistance components&#13;
are required for the power market to develop; without such new equipment and the requisite&#13;
training, the existing dispatch center, which is based on equipment that is substantially out of date,&#13;
will be unable to operate the network efficiently or to create proper financial accounting for the&#13;

Fcbruary 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
116&#13;
settlements required under the new commercial rules. For these two components of the project&#13;
there does not appear to be a second-best alternative against which they can be compared.&#13;
5.    From the purely technical standpoint the second-best alternative to the transmission&#13;
components could consist of a different design, e.g. a lower or higher voltage for the transmission&#13;
lines and a different combination of 230/500kV lines. ISA's technical analyses provide assurance&#13;
that alternative designs are not economical. Furthermore, it should be noted that the expansion&#13;
plan is designed within a joint generation/transmission optimization perspective, including an&#13;
optimized sitting of future gas plants.&#13;
6.    Adopting a more global approach, the next-best alternatives used to vcrify the cost-&#13;
effectiveness of the project consist of studying alternatives whereby the proposed transmission&#13;
reinforcements (including any design variations) are substituted by installing generating capacity&#13;
to provide equivalent service. In practical terms, within the context of the generation and&#13;
transmission expansion plan, this would require relocating new generating facilities. The&#13;
generating facilities identified in the plan are:&#13;
* 1995-2000:&#13;
-  747MW repowering of gas-based plants on the Atlantic Coast (commissioned)&#13;
which will add 507MW net to the system;&#13;
-  232MW gas-based generation in the Southwest (commissioned)&#13;
-  400MW gas-based generation in the Central region,&#13;
-  I 1 OOMW hydro generation,&#13;
-  45OMW coal-based (15OMW commissioned, 300MW on the Atlantic Coast).&#13;
* 2001-2007:&#13;
-  3700MW gas-based plants&#13;
- 2068MW hydro plants&#13;
7.    San Carlos-San Marcos System. The lines and substations included in this component&#13;
are a necessary reinforcement to supply the demand for power in the Southwestern area of the&#13;
country. This region is relatively energy-poor and has fewer generation resources compared to&#13;
other areas; its supply is particularly vulnerable during the dry months as it lacks significant&#13;
storage facilities in its hydro plants.&#13;
8.    Although substantial thermal generation is planned to be located in the region (232MW in&#13;
the 1995-2000 period), a second best alternative to the proposed transmission reinforcements&#13;
would consist of relocating around 400MW of gas-based generation to the Southwest in the&#13;
1995-2000 period, and a further IOOMW around 2001. Consequently, given the equivalence in&#13;
overall capacity (and assuming that dispatch conditions are roughly similar), the least cost tradeoff&#13;
consists of transporting electricity through the proposed transmission facilities or transporting gas&#13;
through a gas pipeline in order to feed the relocated plant. There would be no cost differences&#13;
regarding generation investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
117&#13;
9.    The cash flows associated with the project are shown in Table 11-1. They consist of&#13;
*  Investment Costs;&#13;
*  Operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs of the project, estimated to be 2% of&#13;
investment per year, which corresponds to ISA's previous experience with&#13;
transmission facilities;&#13;
*  Savings due to lower losses with the project; and&#13;
*  Savings associated with the reduction of incremental gas transportation costs for&#13;
supplying the relocated plant.&#13;
10.   The savings in gas transport were based on a heat rate of 9544 Btu/kWh for the relocated&#13;
plant, against 9733 Btu/kWh for the original plant (due to lower ambient temperatures prevailing&#13;
in Cali). The energy delivered by the plant corresponds to the energy originally supplied by the&#13;
thermal plant before relocation, with an average plant factor of 50%. The incremental&#13;
transportation cost is based on the price quoted by ECOPETROL for transporting gas to the Cali&#13;
area (US$2.4/MBtu) less the price for transporting gas to the original location in the central&#13;
region (US$1 .0/MBtu). Taking into account the efficiency difference, the incremental&#13;
transportation cost is equivalent to savings on the order of US$13/MWh.&#13;
11.   At a 12% discount rate, the present value of the investment and incremental operational&#13;
and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs of the proposed San Carlos-San Marcos reinforcements amounts&#13;
to US$106 million. The present value of project benefits, quantified as savings due to reduced&#13;
losses and reduced gas transportation costs, amounts to US$171million. Consequently the&#13;
project yields a net present value of US$65 million and a Benefit/Cost (B/C) ratio of 1.6. The&#13;
Equalizing Discount Rate (EDR), i.e. the discount rate that yields a B/C ratio of 1.0, amounts to&#13;
20%, which exceeds the acceptable rate of return (12%), thereby justifying the project as part of&#13;
the least cost plan.&#13;
12.   Regarding the timing of the San Carlos-San Marcos component, its benefits could be&#13;
reduced due to lower demand in the Cali area. Under a low demand growth scenario (on the&#13;
order of 4.3% p.a.), the project would yield no benefits for the first two years of operation; in this&#13;
case, the EDR would decrease to 15%, which is still above the benchmark discount rate of 12%.&#13;
13.   La Loma-Copey and Paipa-Bucaramanga System. The purpose of this system is to (a)&#13;
connect the 300MW Cesar coal plant to the Atlantic Coast and Central Region systems and (b) to&#13;
increase the transmission system reliability by creating an additional interconnection between the&#13;
Atlantic Coast and Central Region systems.&#13;
14.   The 300MW coal plant was decided on the basis of fuel diversification and to reduce the&#13;
risk of supply shortfall. Consequently, a second best alternative in this case would consist of an&#13;
equivalent coal plant (in order to preserve the fuel diversification policy dictated by existing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
118&#13;
constraints on gas supply), located at a site where the proposed transmission reinforcement is no&#13;
longer needed.&#13;
15.   Two possible alternatives to the La Loma-Copey and Paipa-Bucaramanga System were&#13;
identified:&#13;
* Tasajero 11 (300MW) located in the general area served by the Paipa-Bucaramanga&#13;
line, or&#13;
* Tasajero 1l(150MW) and Cartagena IV (150MW), the latter being located in the&#13;
Atlantic Coast region.&#13;
16.   The base case comparison is shown in Table 11-4. The alternatives were analyzed by&#13;
comparing the total generation and transmission costs (including fuel costs) associated with the&#13;
proposed project and the second best alternatives:&#13;
* Investment costs are lower for the proposed project (Cesar-Loma-Copey);&#13;
- There are slightly lower fuel costs associated with the second-best alternative&#13;
consisting of Tasajero 11 150MW and Cartagena IV 150MW.&#13;
17.   The overall result shows a cost ratio of 1.04 whereby the second-best alternative exceeds&#13;
the proposed project costs at 12% discount (the fuel savings do not compensate for the extra&#13;
investment cost). The equalizing discount rate whereby the fuel savings are enough to justify the&#13;
second-best alternative is over 50%.&#13;
1 8.   Sensitivity Analysis. The previous results were subjected to the following sensitivity&#13;
tests:&#13;
* A: 10% increase in investment costs,&#13;
*  B: 10% decrease in gas transportation costs for the San Carlos-San Marcos&#13;
transmission project;&#13;
*  C: 10% decrease in coal costs for the Loma-Copey project and its second-best&#13;
alternatives,&#13;
*  D: discount rates of 10% and 14%&#13;
19.   The sensitivity results are shown in Tables 1 1-2 and 11-3 (San Carlos-San Marcos) and&#13;
11-5 and 11-6 (Loma-Copey), they are summarized as follows:&#13;

14% Discount Rate               N.A.          1.04&#13;
The results show that the projects' cost-effectiveness characteristics are robust in relation with&#13;
changes in the underlying assumptions.&#13;
20.   Shifts in some of the key variables were identified which would lead to preferring the&#13;
second-best alternatives to the proposed project components. For the San Carlos-San Marcos&#13;
component, the transportation cost to Cali would need to decrease to around Col $1.7/MBtu for&#13;
the EDR to become 12%; this would imply a 29% decrease in the gas transport cost. Similarly, a&#13;
break-even fuel cost is obtained for the Loma-Copey component when fuel costs for the Cesar&#13;
coal plant increase by 35%.&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
21.   The economic analysis consists of evaluating the rate of return for ISA's overall&#13;
investment plan. Although most of the components for the Third Transmission Plan are part of&#13;
the Bank-financed project, the analysis includes a small number of additional investments which&#13;
are not part of the project.&#13;
22.   Costs consist of the investment costs for the 1994-99 period, together with O&amp;M costs&#13;
associated with these investments until year 2022. Benefits are calculated by comparing the&#13;
operating conditions with and without the proposed investment program:&#13;
* Without the program, demand growth leads to a progressive saturation of&#13;
ISA's network at which point demand and operating conditions are kept&#13;
constant;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
120&#13;
* With the program, additional energy and capacity are delivered through the&#13;
network until network saturation occurs, at which point demand and operating&#13;
conditions are again kept constant.&#13;
23.   The benefits attributable to the investment program are then valued as follows:&#13;
*  The difference in operating costs with and without the program are benefits&#13;
attributable to the lower cost dispatch (due to the lifting of transmission&#13;
bottlenecks) made possible by network reinforcements; and&#13;
*  The difference in energy supplied to consumers with and without the program&#13;
is valued according to a proxy for their willingness to pay.&#13;
24.   The additional revenue generated by sales to final consumers, less the required&#13;
subtransmission and distribution costs incurred to deliver the energy, was used as a proxy for the&#13;
willingness to pay. (The cost of the incremental energy delivered is included when the net&#13;
operating benefits of the project are computed.) The incremental revenue serves as a lower bound&#13;
for the willingness to pay of final consumers located at the lower voltage level, as it ignores the&#13;
consumer surplus over and above the cash revenues associated with incremental sales.&#13;
25.   The O&amp;M costs associated with the program were calculated as 2% of the investment&#13;
cost, which is consistent with ISA's past experience.&#13;
26.   The capacity and energy delivered through the network were calculated through a Monte&#13;
Carlo generation-transmission simulation program; the operating costs were obtained using the&#13;
Hydrothermal Dispatch module of the SUPER/OLADE-BID program. These dispatch costs are&#13;
calculated on the basis of a losses interconnection network, and therefore require an adjustment to&#13;
take into account the loss increase or decrease associated with the program.&#13;
27.   The results are summarized in Table 1 1-7. Most of the benefits associated with the&#13;
investment program relate to the decrease in operating costs (i.e. savings in thermal generation)&#13;
made possible through the proposed interconnection reinforcements. Without the project, the&#13;
operating cost of the system increases because of a more intensive use of high-cost thermal plants&#13;
due to transmission constraints as well as higher network losses. This confirms the project's&#13;
overall objective which seeks to lift transmission bottlenecks in order to facilitate the operation of&#13;
the bulk energy market.&#13;
28.   The analysis yields the following benchmark values:&#13;
*  Net Present Value of Costs (12% discount rate):   US$186 million&#13;
*  Net Present Value of Benefits:                  US$250 million&#13;
*  B/C ratio                                             1.34&#13;
*  Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR):              27%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
121&#13;
29.   Sensitivity Analysis. The economic analysis was subjected to the following sensitivity&#13;
variations:&#13;
A- First and Second year reduction of benefits. These benefits are associated with short term&#13;
network reinforcements (such as compensation equipment in the San Marcos substation);&#13;
B- Increase of 10% in investment program costs;&#13;
C- Decrease of 10% in operating benefits; and&#13;
D- Lower demand growth rates; this case was calculated assuming a 4.3% per annum&#13;
average growth rate for electricity demand.&#13;
30.   The sensitivity cases are shown in Tables 11-8 to 11-11; they yield the following results:&#13;

31.   The results show that the investment program provides an adequate rate of return under&#13;
conservative evaluation conditions: (a) as only energy-related benefits were quantified, and&#13;
capacity-related benefits were disregarded due to the analytical difficulties associated with their&#13;
evaluation; and (b) the net consumer surplus associated with the additional supplies enabled by the&#13;
program was not quantified due to the uncertainty associated with parameters such as the price&#13;
elasticity of demand.&#13;
32.   The sensitivity analysis allows the identification of shifts in the principal variables which&#13;
could reduce the benefits of the project. The principal source of benefits consists of fuel savings&#13;
and loss reduction which can be achieved with the transmission investment program. If these are&#13;
reduced by around 27%, the net present value of the project at 12% discount becomes zero.&#13;
Similarly, an increase in program costs on the order of 35% with respect to the budgeted values&#13;
would also lead to a zero net present value. These "safety margins" are unlikely to be consistently&#13;
exceeded during the program's lifetime (benefits) or during its construction phase (investment&#13;
costs).&#13;

Assumptions For ISA's Financial Projections&#13;
General&#13;
I1.    Financial projections for 1995-2004 were prepared by ISA in current prices and&#13;
are expressed in millions of Colombian pesos (Col $ million). Expected inflation rates&#13;
and exchange rates used are detailed in the following table:&#13;
Table 1&#13;
1994     1995      1996     1997      1998              1999-2004&#13;

The other main assumptions adopted to prepare the financial projections are&#13;
summarized in Table 2:&#13;
Table 2&#13;
Item                                               Assumption&#13;
INCOME FORECAST&#13;
Transmission Revenues     See para. 3 below.&#13;
Operations and            Estimated at 1.5% of gross fixed assets in operation.&#13;
Maintenance&#13;
Administrative and        Estimated at 0. 5% of gross fixed assets in operation.&#13;
General Expenses&#13;
Depreciation              In accordance with the current accounting standards, ISA applies a 6.6%&#13;
accelerated depreciation.&#13;
Taxes                     ISA pays custom duties and VAT taxes. In accordance with Law #142, dated&#13;
July 11, 94, ISA pays income tax (37.5%). Starting in 1996, ISA will pay in&#13;
advance income taxes as follows: 25% in 1996, 50% in 1997, and 75% from&#13;
1998 onwards. VAT paid for capital expenditures is discounted from the&#13;
income tax at the commissioning year.&#13;
Other Non-operational     Include interest earned on deposits.&#13;
Income (expenses)&#13;
Dividend Payment.         No dividend payments are considered. so net income is capitalized.&#13;
FLOW of FUNDS&#13;
Investment Program        MIME prepared demand projections dated January, 1995. They consider an&#13;
average 6.1% sales growth during the period, assuming and average 3.7%&#13;
transmission losses over net power generation. The investment program is&#13;
based on the Indicative Generation and Transmission Expansion Plan approved&#13;
by CONPES for the period 1995-2007.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
133&#13;
Item                                             Assumption&#13;
Financing of Investment    See Table 12.4 and Annex 10 - Project Description, Costs, and Implementation&#13;
Program                  Plan. Reasonable availability of external financing from international&#13;
institutions, commercial banks - through FEN or directly - and from suppliers&#13;
of foreign components of the investment program havc been assumed. No local&#13;
credits have been considered.&#13;
BALANCE STATEMENT&#13;
Revaluation of Assets    Fixed assets are revalued with internal inflation, taking into account the useful&#13;
life of the installation.&#13;
Accounts Receivable      Are based on sixty days of billing for distribution utilities and other direct&#13;
customers.&#13;
Inventory                Projected as 0.5% of fixed assets in operation.&#13;
Accounts payable         Are estimated as percentage of cash operating expenses, and local costs of the&#13;
investment program.&#13;
2.     Calculation of Transmission revenues. The transmission revenues are composed&#13;
of: (a) usage of the transmission system wheeling charges and (b) connection fees, and are&#13;
based on the regulated rates defined in the Public Service Law and rules #00 I through&#13;
#004, issued by the ERC in 11.02.94&#13;
3.     Wheeling Charges. ISA transmission revenues due to the use of the system are&#13;
defined in accordance with the following formulae:&#13;
ISA Revenue= a*Mt&#13;
Mt= R.+ Kt&#13;
and R, = R,.,*[(IPP/IPP ,-) + (X/100)]&#13;
where,&#13;
M, =   regulated revenue due for the whole of the transmission system during year&#13;
t;&#13;
R,=   Regulated revenue in 1994 equal to Col $138,595 million (at September&#13;
1994 prices);&#13;
IPP    Wholesale Price Index;&#13;
X =   growth factor of the regulated revenues. Currently fixed at 5% for the next&#13;
5 years. (This factor is revised every five years).&#13;
K,=   Correction factor (positive or negative) applied to the regulated revenues,&#13;
depending on the actual variation of the IPP.&#13;
a      72.7% of the transmission system assigned to ISA during 1995-1997, and&#13;
72.5% from 1998 onwards.&#13;
4.     Connection fees. Calculated taking into account the inventory of assets connected&#13;
to the distribution utilities, valued at replacement cost and adjusted according to the&#13;
variation of the power sector cost index. The assets included in this calculation&#13;
correspond to a transformation module at 230/500 kV and 230/500 kV power&#13;
transformers. Connection fees are estimated to amount to US$ 15 million at June 1993&#13;
prices.&#13;

ANNEX 13&#13;
COLOMBIA&#13;
POWER MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAI, EVALUATION&#13;
Main Environmental Issues Associated with the Three Transmission Lines&#13;
1.    Over the past years, ISA has demonstrated a noteworthy commitment to incorporating&#13;
environmental issues within the decision making process to select optimal transmnission&#13;
projects. Since 1992, ISA has being developing the "Metodologia para el Estudio de&#13;
Restricciones Ambientales y Selecci6n de Altemativas de Ruta". The methodology combines a&#13;
Geographical Information System (ILWIS) for data gathering as well as photo interpretation,&#13;
field work, and secondary data. It was applied to the San Carlos-San Marcos (500 kV)&#13;
Transmission Line. The methodology represents a significant advance in environmental&#13;
assessment starting with the earliest stage of the transmission project cycle. It permits selection&#13;
of the corridor by weighting socio-economic, cultural, political and physic-biotic factors with&#13;
electrical, technical and economnic objectives. The main environmental restrictions are&#13;
automatically incorporated within the designs, thereby assuring that highly complex&#13;
environmental effects will be avoided.&#13;
2.    ISA prepared and submitted to the Bank the report "Estudio de Restricciones&#13;
Amnbientales - Tercer Plan de Transmision", which identifies the main environmental and social&#13;
constraints that are being used to select the optimal corridor and to be taken into account&#13;
within the design of the three transmission lines. This report also contains the sequence of steps&#13;
followed by ISA to incorporate environmental and social considerations within the entire&#13;
project cycle. The report was approved by the Bank. Based on lessons leamed in construction&#13;
and operation of the present national interconnected system, the following environmental issues&#13;
have been analyzed:&#13;
(a)    Abiotic Environment: geomorphology, erosion, soil alteration and&#13;
destabilization of slopes as a consequence of construction of roads; mining&#13;
activities and current and potential morphodynamic processes resulting from&#13;
human intervention.&#13;
(b)    Biotic Environment: unique ecosystems of high biodiversity or high fragility;&#13;
natural resources affected (especially water); loss of vegetative cover, effects&#13;
on protected areas (e.g., national parks, natural reserves and areas with special&#13;
jurisdiction).&#13;
(c)    Socio-economic and Socio-cultural Environment: restriction to the right-&#13;
of-way derived from indigenous reserves or national minorities settlements;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 142 -&#13;
special cultural and archaeological regions; highly populated areas; economic&#13;
activities; land tenure; conflict related to the use of scarce natural resources;&#13;
socio-political conflict in the area of influence of the transmission line.&#13;
San Carlos-San Marcos. Main Environmental Restrictions&#13;
3.    This 500 kV line (380 km; 24 meter right-of-way) will be developed to supply energy&#13;
to the southwest region of the interconnected system. For this line, several altematives were&#13;
assessed. The alignment selected is expected to generate low environmental impacts mainly&#13;
related to vegetation clearance, access paths and use of sensitive terrain (e.g., river crossings).&#13;
Impacts on human settlements, cultivated lands, critical wildlife habitat, sites of archaeological&#13;
interest, human health and visual landscape have been rated low. Special care of avoiding&#13;
negative impacts on sugar cane plantations were taken during corridor selection. The designs&#13;
will be finalized during the first quarter in 1995. Consultoria Colombiana, the firm in charge of&#13;
the designs, is carrying out, in parallel, a project-specific environmental report containing the&#13;
environmental mitigation plan.&#13;
4.    A plan for the identification of potential archaeological sites that can be affected by the&#13;
construction of the towers, and the sequential rescue of the archaeological heritage has been&#13;
scheduled to start prior to construction and will be extended until excavations in tower-sitting&#13;
and paths are finished.&#13;
La Loma-Copey and Paipa-Bucaramanga. Main Environmental Restrictions&#13;
5.    According to the current expansion plan and demand scenario, the two lines are&#13;
required to start operating after 1997. The specific Study of Environmental Impacts will&#13;
be undertaken by a consultant firm during 1995-96. Detailed mitigation measures and a&#13;
monitoring system will be prepared while detailed engineering, definitive route alignment&#13;
and field surveys are carried out prior to 1996. The preliminary studies for these 230 kV&#13;
lines have identified some critical environmental aspects in a 4 km wide corridor. They&#13;
are: (a) potential effects on a forestry reserve a native forest known as "Robledales" in the&#13;
Virolin region, the status of which is currently being reviewed; and (b) impacts on the&#13;
urban population living around the final substation in Bucaramanga. To avoid impacts on&#13;
the Robledales forest ISA will use the existing corridor that was opened for the 500 kV&#13;
line. ISA is also contemplating alternatives to avoid undesirable impacts on the&#13;
neighborhood located around the substation in Bucaramanga. Other constraints are&#13;
related to the socio-political conflicts in Santander. The Bank will carefully review the&#13;
study when available to ensure conformity with Bank environmental guidelines and will&#13;
supervise the environmental performance during the implementation of the two mentioned&#13;
lines.&#13;
Environmental Management Plan&#13;
6.    Along with the current scheme to assess environmental impacts associated with&#13;
transmission lines, a complete Environmental Management Plan to mitigate and&#13;
compensate undesirable effects on human and natural systems is being prepared. It&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 143 -&#13;
embraces programs dealing with social communication and negotiation with affected and&#13;
benefited communities; compensation for physical losses; reforestation or grass-planting;&#13;
archaeological rescue; resettlement of displaced population; rural electrification, policy on&#13;
local employment and supplies for contractor camps; creation of preserved areas;&#13;
mitigation of impacts derived from access construction; path maintenance; monitoring of&#13;
migratory species; and micro-basin management and environmental monitoring. ISA will&#13;
prepare project-specific environmental reports satisfactory to the Bank for each of the&#13;
project's transmission lines before the bidding process. In addition, general procedures to&#13;
incorporate environmental standards and safeguards have been included within the bidding&#13;
documents for contractors of main civil works.&#13;
Resettlement&#13;
7.    Relocation from transmission lines is usually much simpler compared to other kinds of&#13;
infrastructure construction due to the fact that houses and assets can be displaced just a few&#13;
meters away from the corridor and in many cases land can be utilized for agriculture or grazing&#13;
(except for forestry and tall fruit trees). The three lines do not affect concentrated&#13;
comnmunities. In 1991, the Colombian Electric Power Sector prepared and approved an official&#13;
Resettlement Policy which is consistent with World Bank resettlement policy. ISA has&#13;
undertaken successful experiences in applying a participative approach to resettlement of&#13;
scattered populations living along the right-of-way of the lines of the existing interconnected&#13;
system. Individual solutions for housing, land and economic activities restoration have been&#13;
designed and implemented in conjunction with each affected family.&#13;
8.    In the case of the San Carlos-San Marcos transmission line, the population to be&#13;
displaced along the corridor comprises 42 families (176 persons). Due to the small size of&#13;
the right-of-way that is necessary to raise the towers, many affected families will be able to&#13;
remain on their lots and will be given a new house. Regardless of the small number of&#13;
people that will be displaced by these lines, the borrower will prepare a resettlement plan&#13;
for Bank approval before opening the bidding process. The ISA social team has already&#13;
contacted the affected families to inform them about the project, the expected&#13;
environmental and social effects, the ISA's resettlement policy, and their rights in terms of&#13;
compensation and indemnization. The families' expectations and preferences are being&#13;
included in the resettlement plan.&#13;
9.    In the case of the transmission lines foreseen to reinforce the Atlantic Coast Region,&#13;
design is scheduled to start in 1996 and construction will begin in 1998. Therefore, definite&#13;
figures for displacement of population will not be available until detailed engineering designs&#13;
are finished. Moreover, the final centerline can be changed even during the construction phase.&#13;
Although the selected corridors avoid human settlements, a small number of families living&#13;
within the right-of-way corridor might be displaced. Regardless the number of people that will&#13;
be displaced by these lines, the borrower will prepare a resettlement plan for Bank approval&#13;
and will follow the same procedures agreed for the San Carlos-San Marcos transmission line.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 144 -&#13;
Institutional Capacity for Environmental Assessment and Management&#13;
10.   The recent institutional reforms in the Colombian Electric Power Sector and the&#13;
restructuring of ISA as an independent transmission company, emphasize ISA's role in&#13;
planning, implementation and operation of the existing and planned expansion of the national&#13;
transmission system. Therefore, ISA is responsible for implementing environmental&#13;
management plans for the current and new transmission lines and for directly monitoring&#13;
compliance with national and sectoral environmental normns and proposed mitigation measures.&#13;
Monitoring and evaluation is to be undertaken by the Direcci6n de Proyectos de la Gerencia de&#13;
Transmisi6n de ISA.&#13;
11.   Gradually moving from corrective to preventive management is improving ISA's&#13;
institutional capacity. The studies of altemative alignments and environmental constraints are&#13;
carried out by an interdisciplinary team comprising ecologists, anthropologists, sociologists,&#13;
economists, geologists, and environmental engineers. The interdisciplinary team works in&#13;
conjunction with the electric and civil engineers in charge of project design, in order to achieve&#13;
the optimal electrical, technical, economic and environmental decisions. Occasionally other&#13;
environmental specialists can be brought in as needed. Finally, the recently created Ministry of&#13;
Environment is responsible for providing the environmental licenses once ISA presents the&#13;
Report on Environmental Impact for each transmission line and fulfllls all requirements to&#13;
demonstrate their environmental feasibility.&#13;
Legal Framework&#13;
12.   In recent years, the government has been making a significant effort to strengthen the&#13;
regulatory framework in order to promote an environmentally sustainable development in the&#13;
Electric Power Sector. Since the creation of the Ministry of Environment (ME) and the&#13;
approval of the National Environmental Law (NEL)2, specific regulations for environmental&#13;
assessment and licensing for electric power projects have been established.&#13;
13.   The recently approved National Environmental Law establishes a new procedure&#13;
according to which an Environmental Diagnosis of Alternatives (EDA) should be presented to&#13;
the ME. The EDA should present several altematives for each project and assess their&#13;
advantages and drawbacks. The ME will select the optimal altemative and will request a&#13;
detailed Environmental Assessment before providing the corresponding permit to build the&#13;
project. The new legal procedure is intended to ensure optimal decisions in selecting&#13;
environmentally sound projects.&#13;
14.   The new Electricity Law approved by Congress in July 1994 explicitly establishes the&#13;
adequate protection of the environment, consultation with affected communities and relevant&#13;
social groups involved in all operations of the electric power sector (See Chapter X: de la&#13;
Conservaci6n del Medio Ambiente, art. 50 to 53). Sound environmental planning, execution&#13;
and operation of the transmission lines is widely recognized as a condition for privatization of&#13;
the electric power facilities. In addition, the regulation of the recently approved NEL explicitlv&#13;
2Ley 99 de Diciembre de 1993&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 145 -&#13;
requires an Environmental Assessment of altematives for transmission lines among other&#13;
projects (see Chapter IV art. 17 to 20 of Law 99/93: Diagn6stico Ambiental de Altemativas).&#13;
The NEL also establishes the new processes for clearance and environmental licensing.&#13;
15.   Non-governmental organizations, both at the local and national levels, as well as&#13;
private consulting firms, have participated in the environmental assessment and design of&#13;
the planned transmission system. Active discussions on methodologies to incorporate&#13;
environmental considerations since the earliest stage in the planning process, have been&#13;
put in place at both the regional and sectoral level.&#13;

monitor ISA performance:&#13;
(a)   Weighted Average Frequency of Interruption (Fi)&#13;
Fi    =  (E Pi) / CEM&#13;
Pi    =  Interrupted power in MW&#13;
CEM  =  Average capacity of the transmission network in MW&#13;
(b)   Weighted Average Length of Interruptions (Di)&#13;
Di   =  Y (PixDHi)/ZP&#13;
Pi    =  Interrupted power in MW&#13;
DHi  =  Length of interruption in hours.&#13;
(c)   Average Interruption Time (TEI)&#13;
TEI  =  X (Pix DHI)/CEM&#13;
Pi:      Interrupted power in MW&#13;
DHi:    Length of interruption in hours&#13;
CEM:    Average capacity of the transmission network in MW&#13;
(d)   Reliability Index (IC)&#13;
IC    =  I - (TEI/T)&#13;
TEI  =  Average interruption time&#13;
T     =  8760 hrs&#13;
(e)   Total Transmission Losses (Loss): defined as the ratio:&#13;
Loss = (NG-DG)/NG (%) where&#13;
NG   =  Net energy supplied to ISA's grid&#13;
DG   =  Energy delivered by ISA to its clients&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
150&#13;
(f)    Cash Operating Ratio: defined as the ratio between total cash operating&#13;
expenses and total gross revenues. Total cash operating expenses refers to&#13;
all expenses related to operations, including operation, maintenance and&#13;
administrative expenses, taxes and payments in lieu of taxes, but excluding&#13;
provision for depreciation, income taxes, and other non-cash operating&#13;
charges, interest and other charges on debts. Gross operating revenue&#13;
refers to revenues from all sources related to operations,&#13;
(g)    Self-Financing Ratio: defined as the ratio between funds from internal&#13;
sources and capital expenditures. Funds from internal sources are the&#13;
difference between the sum of revenues from all sources, excluding&#13;
borrowing, and the sum of all expenses related to operations, debt service&#13;
requirements, income taxes, all cash dividends, transfers to the Treasury,&#13;
and variation in working capital other than cash excluding provision for&#13;
depreciation and other non-cash operating charges. Capital expenditures&#13;
means the sum of all expenditures incurred on account of fixed assets,&#13;
including interest charged to construction,&#13;
(h)    Debt Service Coverage: defined as the ratio between gross internal cash&#13;
generation (excluding customer contribution and consumer deposits) and&#13;
total debt service requirements.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The overall objective of Private Sector
            Energy Development Project is to support power sector reform
            by facilitating the operation of a competitive bulk supply
            market for electricity. Specifically, the project seeks to
            lift transmission constraints that hinder an open access of
            publicly as well as privately owned power generators to the
            grid and to support Interconexion Electrica SA (ISA) as
            transmission network operator, system generation dispatcher
            and commercial transactions coordinator. The project will be
            a key component of the comprehensive power sector
            restructuring that is being put in place with Bank
            assistance. The project consists of three components: 1)
            Energy control Center (ECC) and Financial Settlement Center
            (FSC); 2) strengthening and expansion of the interconnected
            transmission system; and 3) technical assistance.
