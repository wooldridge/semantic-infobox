- A foreign trading company, input supply&#13;

of funds                           to finance working capital inputs for a&#13;
Moldovan enterprise. The local firm would&#13;
Letter of credit                Guarantee             repay the working capital advance with a&#13;
portion of the revenues from exporting the&#13;
resulting outputs. To ensure repayment, in-&#13;
put suppliers would act as a marketing agent&#13;
for the Moldovan enterprise, arranging for&#13;
the sale of the output to a creditworthy buyer&#13;
l0 l l  l l l l |outside Moldova. In this way, input suppli-&#13;
ers would also help Moldovan enterprises de-&#13;
velop new markets and restore old markets&#13;
ruptured by the breakup of the Soviet Union.&#13;

            : mitigating political risk in transition
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Moldovan firms wanting to export face
            severe financing constraints. The local banking system has
            neither the capital base nor the technical capacity to
            finance their working capital requirements. And export
            credit agencies either are not willing to provide cover, or,
            if they are, they require a full government counterguarantee
            covering both commercial and political risks. Thus, to
            enable viable local firms to attract private working
            capital, the government of Moldova asked the World Bank to
            help design a pre-export guarantee facility, with the
            proviso that the facility should not require the government
            to assume commercial risks. Under this facility, the
            Moldovan government guarantees financiers against political
            risk, and the World Bank provides a backstop guarantee of
            the government's claim payment obligations. A similar
            approach could be used in other transition economies, where
            firms face similar constraints. This Note describes the
            development of the facility and offers suggestions for
            designing a "line of guarantee" modeled on it as a
            way to help attract private finance for a relatively large
            number of small projects.
