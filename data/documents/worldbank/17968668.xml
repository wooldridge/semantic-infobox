&#13;
OLIVC:R:     1 wonder   if   we can begin, Hr. Bell. by your saying a bit about      study and report ever done for them.&#13;
&#13;
how you got to know Hr. Woods and how you came to the Bank in the first                        Then suddenly, out of the blue, in Hay or June of 196'&lt;, I got a&#13;
&#13;
pi ace.     Pltoase say what you care to about Mr, Woods'     involvement with       telephone cell from George Woods, whom I had never â&#128;¢et, asking me to&#13;
&#13;
your care@r as you so along.                                                         COllie over and see him.   He proceeded to tell me that     th~ngs   on the&#13;

&#13;
back to coming out of the military at the end oÂ£ World War II and going              was becoming rather unhappy about the Indian economic performance and&#13;
&#13;
into the Export-Import Bank of the U. s.           Bill Hartin became President      that he didn't feel that either the Bank or the other aid givers knew&#13;

of the Bank and invited â&#128;¢e to come and work there.           After a couple of       sa mueh about th@ Indian economy and its problems as it should.&#13;

&#13;
relevant to your concerns here, but, in 1953, the Eisenhower                         make an extended survey and asked whether I would be willing to head&#13;
&#13;
administration came into office, and the new Treasury Secretary decided              the mission and join the World Bank.         I said, "No" to the latter, bur,&#13;
&#13;
that the Export Import Bank should stop making loans; it should merely               "Yes" to the tormer and managed, fortunsrely, to collect a first class&#13;
&#13;
eollect what was outstanding. Half a doz@n of ua decided thst that was               team of people to be on that mission, more than half of whom who were&#13;
&#13;
not a very interesting plsce to be, and we left.                                     people not on the Bank staff; s fev were on the Bank stsft and still&#13;
&#13;
           I went into a private eeonomic consulting firm. I was asked by            are.&#13;
&#13;
several people at this institution whether I would have any interest in              OLIVER:     Do you remember off hand the names of one or two of the stall&#13;
&#13;
coming here.      At the time I said, MNo, I want to try th1s."        They said,    ,.embers1&#13;
&#13;
"Well, .. aybe we e11n eall on you II&amp; s consultant from time to time."              BELL:     The staff member who made the biggest contr1bution, I think, was&#13;
&#13;
And they did, although not until about 1960, for the first          ti~~~e.   That   Sir John Crawford, of whom you may have heard-- an Australian whom&#13;

&#13;
BELL:     No, he was never on the staff of the Bank, but he did work for       own ability to deal with India?&#13;
&#13;
the Bank as a consultant in â&#128;¢any places and very often subsequent to           BI!LL:    I would say he wasn't disaatill'fied, he was unaatiefied by what&#13;
&#13;
this Indian mission.                                                           the Bank atatf had produced on the economy of India,       He wanted a fresh&#13;

&#13;
the Bank staff, but is now the Vice President in charge of South Asia,         BELL:     He knew quite a lot, perhaps as much as anybody on the Bank&#13;
&#13;
Dave Hopper, was also on thoe mission.     I borrowed him fr0111 -- I've       staff.     He probably knew more of the principal actors on the Indian&#13;

&#13;
as a member of the mission along with another man who has recentlY             BELL:     One of them, perhaps the most widely known, was our&#13;
&#13;
retired frcm the Bank, Stanley Please, who, at that ti.,e, was also            recommendation that there be a devalUGtion of the rupee.        That was a&#13;
&#13;
relatively new and later occupied â&#128;¢any quite important positions in the        recQmlllendation which, of course, had to be implemented by a d1scussion&#13;

B11nk.    He is retired from the Bank n""' and is at Oxford University.    A   between the lHF and the government of India.      That discussion occurred&#13;

British.     He left the Bank a year or two after thu India mission and        devaluation of the rupee, which we, in fact,      thought was not quite big&#13;

went to th(' Foreign Office in the U, K.      ln recent years he has been      enough-, but accepted,&#13;

OLIVER:      I think it might be worth your telling whet you told me                   SELL:     Well, there was a aeries of recommendations which related to the&#13;
&#13;
earlier about Hr. Woods' concern thet the question of exchange rates                   whole import regime.        We were recommending a reduction in trade&#13;

&#13;
BELL:     Yes.    When, at his request, I drafted terms of reference for the           of imports.       Another set of recommendations was related to the problem&#13;
&#13;
forthco.ing mission, he reviewed them and said,          ~ell   nov you, a.ong         of internal economic regulations,        The Government of India had a very&#13;

told h1â&#128;¢ that I didn't think we could, it vae an integral part of the                  difficult for the Indians to accept. I can recall one of the meetings&#13;

of any capability into agricultural research, agriculture estenaion, or         BKLL:     Well, originally when Mr. Woods told the then Minister of&#13;

         The principal recommendations were that there be substantially         objected.     He didn't want it done, saw no usefulness in it.      He finally&#13;

increased invest111ent in iuÂ·igation facilities: that there be a                agr~ed    that such a study could be done provided that the report would&#13;

much opportunity to observe.        He and 1 had only o.,. disagreement.          It&#13;
&#13;
left us angty with each other,        not on speaking terms for about two&#13;
&#13;
weeks.      He didn't like my dillagreeing with a position he was proposing&#13;
&#13;
to take, t'lnd I hadn't liked his &lt;:lat.ing thtlt he had never agreed with&#13;
&#13;
my view on the matter          th1a happened to be on a matter on which we&#13;
&#13;
had earlier agreed and I had acted accordingly.           He started the&#13;
&#13;
conversation by denying that he'd ever agreed to ouch a th1.ng.               I&#13;
&#13;
reminded him of the e&gt;&lt;act words of the conver..,tion.           He then changed&#13;
&#13;
and said, "You're right, 1 rea.e-ber, but anyway don't do thu.            N&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ct.!VER:    Wso he was in sc.e sense bull-headed, to use that phrsse1 I&#13;
&#13;
don't want tO put wordEr in your â&#128;¢out h.&#13;
&#13;
BELL:      I don't think so.   He was eore thoughtful thon that, just as&#13;
&#13;
McNamara was, but I really didn't see it tested.&#13;
&#13;
ct.IVER:    It sounds like he had â&#128;¢ore of a capacity, ot least&#13;
&#13;
tf.'lllporarily, to be angry with di11agreement than HcNâ&#128;¢ara did.&#13;
&#13;
BU.t.:     Perhops, I'â&#128;¢ not &amp;ure.    In HcNDIIIsrs'o esse, I think, he rather&#13;
&#13;
regretted that â&#128;¢ore people didn't speak up and say what they thought.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:      Well, we've run out of tape.    We'll have to save the rest for&#13;
&#13;
another t1me.      Thank you very much for today.&#13;

            In November 1985 and January 1988,
            Bernard R. Bell was interviewed on behalf of the World Bank
            Group Archives oral history program by Robert W. Oliver.
            During his tenure at the Bank from 1965 to 1977, Mr. Bell
            worked in the following areas: in the projects department as
            assistant director of economics (1965-1967) and as deputy
            director (1967-1968); in Indonesia as director of resident
            staff (1969-1972); in the East Africa region department as
            vice president (1972-1974); and in the East Asia and Pacific
            (EAP) region as regional vice president (1974-1977). Mr.
            Bell also talks about his pre-World Bank experience as chief
            economist of the Export-Import bank in the United States.
            His transcript concerns his ambitions for the World Bank to
            expand the volume of lending to developing countries, a goal
            later achieved under the direction of World Bank president
            Robert McNamara.
