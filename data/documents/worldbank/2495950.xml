            Gravity-fed water supply in Ethiopia :
            community management and financial sustainability
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            A community-based WaterAid supported
            program in the Arsi and Bale Zones of Oromia, Ethiopia, id
            demonstrating effective community management. Three separate
            gravity-fed water supply schemes have improved the quality
            and accessibility of water supplied to rural and poor urban
            households, with nearly 200,000 people already served
            (design population 260,000). Two main factors have
            contributed to the success of these schemes. Firstly, the
            development of a participatory management structure that has
            passed on ownership of the system to local community members
            at all levels; and secondly, effective local financial
            management (the disconnection of non-payers, for example,
            has encouraged high levels of payment for water services).
            Progress still needs to be made in such matters as the
            provision of water for livestock, and the promotion of
            proper sanitation and hygiene practices. Participatory
            evaluations indicate that community-managed differentiated
            tariff levels and cross-subsidization do assist in providing
            a service to the poorest community members.
