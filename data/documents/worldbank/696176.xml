CHAPTER 1&#13;
ECONOMIC AND SECTOR SETTING&#13;
A.  THE ECONOMY AND THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
1.1   Economic and Sector Setting. Indonesia, the world's largest archipelagic nation, extends&#13;
some 5,000km across the equator. It comprises several thousand islands, the largest of which are&#13;
Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Irian Jaya. The country is endowed with considerable&#13;
natural resources. Until the early 1970s agriculture and forestry constituted the mainstay of the&#13;
economy and were the main source of foreign exchange. Since the 1980s the Government has&#13;
successfully implemented policies aimed at developing and broadening the manufacturing base of&#13;
the economy.&#13;
1.2   The distribution of population is uneven and is mainly concentrated on Java which accounts&#13;
for 59% of the population on 7% of the land area. Economic activity is largely determined by the&#13;
differing factor endowments of the islands. Mining activities and oil production are concentrated on&#13;
Sumatra and Kalimantan. Food production and manufacturing are located predominantly on Java.&#13;
The country's transport system and transport flows have been shaped by the economic resource base&#13;
of the islands and the distribution of population.&#13;
1.3    All transport modes - road, rail, coastal shipping, civil aviation and inland waterways - play a&#13;
role in Indonesia's transport system. Overall, the modes tend to complement one another, with each&#13;
serving specific market needs. Java and Sumatra are the only islands that feature rail transport and&#13;
only in Java and in a few other transport corridors on other islands is there intermodal competition.&#13;
Java also has the most highly developed and best integrated transport system and is also the island&#13;
where elimination of capacity constraints and congestion are becoming key concerns.&#13;
1.4    While sea transport is moving large quantities of bulk oil and coals carried on own account&#13;
by the oil and coal industry, general cargo movements by sea are comparatively small. Thus, if sea&#13;
transport is ignored, road is by far the dominant land transport mode, accounting for some 93% of all&#13;
land transport on the islands of Java and Sumatra.  Interurban passenger transport is also&#13;
predominantly by road accounting for 93% of total passenger transport on Java and Sumatra (See&#13;
Figure 1-1).&#13;

1.5    Economic and Transport Sector Performance and Challenges. Over the past ten years,&#13;
the Indonesian economy has grown at more than 6% per annum. Non-oil manufacturing has&#13;
provided the engine of growth with an average annual growth rate of 11.5% per annum. In the&#13;
process the share of manufacturing in GDP increased from 14.6% in 1984 to 23.9% in 1994, while&#13;
that of agriculture declined from 22.7% to 17.4% over the same period. This strong performance in&#13;
economic activity was accompanied by rapid growth in transport, which increased by about 7% per&#13;
annum. Under the Sixth Five Year Development Plan (FYs 1994-95/1998-99) and beyond, GDP is&#13;
targeted to continue to grow at a rapid pace, exceeding 7% per annum. Growth in demand for&#13;
transport would continue to be at least 7% per annum and is expected to be particularly rapid in the&#13;
industrializing areas.&#13;
1.6   In broad terms, the transport system has been able to meet the rapid growth in transport&#13;
demand with road playing the major role. The two main reasons for this performance were: (i) that&#13;
GOI, in its successive five-year plans, consistently devoted considerable resources for transport and&#13;
for road improvement in particular; and (ii) that initially as new roads were being built or upgraded&#13;
the road system had considerable spare capacity.  Despite these achievements, many transport&#13;
corridors are increasingly congested as spare capacity has been exhausted. This is affecting both&#13;
road and rail transport and is presenting the sector with the challenge of creating major new capacity&#13;
on critical parts of the network within a relatively short period of five to ten years. However, in&#13;
contrast to the majority of the traditional upgrading and rehabilitation investments which can be&#13;
prepared and implemented within a short time period, the new capacity expansion investments in&#13;
both road and rail require much longer preparation times owing to the time needed for detailed&#13;
planning studies, for dealing with environmental impacts and acquiring the necessary right-of-way.&#13;
1.7   For the short to medium term, road transport, owing to its greater efficiency and flexibility,&#13;
will need to provide most of the additional capacity to meet the continuing rapid growth in overall&#13;
transport demand. While there is already an extensive rail network on Java, the development and&#13;
quality of rail services has been impeded by a policy and institutional environment that has provided&#13;
more opportunities and flexibility for road transport and inhibited efficiency and innovation in&#13;
railway operations. This in turn has constrained rail investment, with the consequence that many&#13;
sections of the predominantly single track network are now operated at capacity while many&#13;
passenger services are achieving load factors far above 100%. Vigorous implementation of&#13;
appropriate sectoral policies, in particular policies aimed at setting the modes on an equal footing&#13;
regarding infrastructure investment and cost recovery hardly change the relative market shares of&#13;
road, rail and coastal shipping in the near term because of the time needed to fully implement the&#13;
policies and the long lead times - on the order of five to ten years - before policy changes and new&#13;
investments will translate into noteworthy shifts in market shares.&#13;
1.8   Future Role of Rail. In the longer term, however, rail has the potential to play a much&#13;
expanded role in meeting the inter-city passenger transport needs of Java.  The island has a&#13;
population which exceeds 120 million, at 840 persons per sq. km the highest population density in&#13;
the world, a low level of motorization which is increasing rapidly, and a geography and patterns of&#13;
urbanization and industrial development which define high density transport corridors that are well&#13;
suited to efficient passenger railway operation.&#13;
1.9    Given these geographic and population features, continued economic growth and the&#13;
accompanying rise in demand for passenger transport, in the longer term sustainable growth on Java&#13;
will hinge on this potential role being fully exploited. Without further development of the railways&#13;
the rapid growth in inter-city passenger travel on Java would have to be met entirely by road&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
transport which would not be sustainable as it would cause unacceptable environmental and social&#13;
impacts. Serious capacity constraints are already occurring on the road network even though vehicle&#13;
ownership at 23 vehicles per 1000 persons is only a fraction of that in countries such as Japan (510&#13;
vehicles per 1000) and South Korea (142 vehicles per 1000) with similar geography but lower&#13;
population densities. Road transport activity is already a major contributor to worsening air&#13;
pollution in Java, while a high road traffic accident rate is causing considerable human and material&#13;
losses. Moreover, expansion of the road network's capacity is already necessitating the loss of&#13;
valuable agricultural land and, in the vicinity of major cities, the displacement of large numbers of&#13;
people.&#13;
1.10  If Java were to follow a pattern of transport system development based on a continuing&#13;
heavy reliance on road and corresponding vehicle ownership levels comparable to those observed in&#13;
more industrialized countries, i.e. on the order of 500 vehicles per 1000 persons at GDP per capita&#13;
levels greater than, say US$ 20,000, the vehicle population on Java would rise to be in excess of 60&#13;
million. This would not be a feasible transport system for an economic space with the characteristics&#13;
of Java. This is illustrated for example, by the fact that the road space needed to just park - let alone&#13;
drive - these vehicles would amount to a total of 240.000 lane km or about three times the current&#13;
length of the classified network on Java. This parking space would be equivalent to 240 lanes of&#13;
roads stretching all the way 1000 km from east to west across Java, or almost a km wide band of&#13;
road space across Java. Clearly, an efficient railway system which plays a much greater role in the&#13;
overall transport system, comparable as a minimum to the role played by rail in Japan, where public&#13;
transport accounts for some 35% of passenger travel will, therefore, be a crucial element of&#13;
sustainable transport on Java.&#13;
1.11  On Sumatra, with a population density one-tenth of Java's and an economy that is heavily&#13;
dependent on primary industry, rail's potential role within the transport system is quite different.&#13;
The main drivers for its development are major mining projects, such as the planned expansion of&#13;
the Bukit Asam coal mine, and other large-scale industrial projects (e.g., cement) for which rail&#13;
transport can have an economic role. Expansion of the three Sumatra railway systems should,&#13;
therefore, depend on the phasing of such projects rather than on the growth of passenger and freight&#13;
traffic in general. The required investments should be evaluated and justified as an integral part of&#13;
these projects on a commercial basis.&#13;
B. TRANSPORT SECTOR INSTITUTIONAL, POLICY AND LEGAL SETTING&#13;
1.12  Institutions. The principal Government of Indonesia (GOI) agencies involved in shaping&#13;
the development and regulating the functioning of the transport sector are:&#13;
*  the Ministry of Communications (MOC), which is responsible for sector policy and&#13;
strategy formulation, for the technical and economic regulation of land, sea, and air&#13;
transport, for the provision and management of some transport infrastructure (notably small&#13;
ports and airports), and for the technical guidance and supervision of 17 state-owned&#13;
enterprises (SOEs) including Perumka, the state railway corporation;&#13;
*  the Ministry of Publics Works (MPW), which has primary responsibility for the planning&#13;
and management of the public road network, and which is also responsible for the technical&#13;
guidance and supervision of several SOEs including PT Jasa Marga, the state toll road&#13;
company;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
* Bappenas, the National Development Planning Agency, which has primary responsibility&#13;
for formulating the country's five-year development plans (Repelita) and, in conjunction&#13;
with the Ministry of Finance. for determining the allocation of expenditures under the State&#13;
Development Budget;&#13;
*  the Ministry of Finance (MOF), which, in addition to its responsibilities for shaping the&#13;
State Routine and Development Budgets, also represents GOI's interests as owner of the&#13;
state owned enterprises (SOEs)'.&#13;
1.13   Policy Framework. The basic guidelinles for the development of the transport sector are&#13;
contained in the Outline of State Goals and Policies (Garis-Garis Besar HalLian Negara or GBHN).&#13;
The GBHN  is formulated by the People's Consultative Assembly at five-yearly intervals and in&#13;
status is subordinate only to the Constitution. The GBHN serves as the mandate for the incoming&#13;
President and Cabinet and forns the basis for the subsequent Repelita plan, which elaborates targets&#13;
and policies and defines development programs for their realization.&#13;
1.14   Since the mid-1980s, there have been significant changes in transport sector policies. The&#13;
general thrust of these reforms has been to reduce economic regulation and the extent of government&#13;
interventions in the functioning of transport markets, and to enable and promote increased private&#13;
participation in the provision of transport services and infrastructure. Attention focused initially on&#13;
the maritime transport subsector, where higih costs, poor services and long delays were crippling&#13;
domestic and international trade. Two major deregulation packages - known as Inpres 4/1985 and&#13;
Paknov 1988 - redefined the role of'government and resulted respectively in dramatic improvements&#13;
in port management and productivity and in the effticiency and quality of shippilig services.&#13;
1.1 5   Reforms in the other transport subsectors have been less dramatic - in part because the&#13;
problems were less severe and less amenable to solution by radical measures - and commenced&#13;
somewhat later. In the road subsector, where economic regulation of the industry was already&#13;
relatively light, the primary focus has been on establishing appropriate road use regulations,&#13;
upgrading enforcement, strengthening the planning and implementation of road infrastructure works,&#13;
improving safety and reducing vehicle overloading, and increasing the recovery of infrastructure&#13;
costs from road users. In the civil aviation subsector, the reforms to date hiave resulted in increased&#13;
and more effective private competition to the two state-owned airlines. In the railway subsector, the&#13;
initial reforms included converting the state railway agency, PJKA, into a public corporation&#13;
(Perumka), relaxing government controls over fare and rate setting, and enabling increased private&#13;
participation.&#13;
1.1 6   Private Sector Participation. In parallel with the above sector-specific reforms, GOI has&#13;
been moving to increase private participation in SOEs, with the twin aims of improving efficiency&#13;
and mobilizing the financial and technical resources required for their future growth. This is being&#13;
accomplished through the partial divestiture of enterprises that have already attained the status of&#13;
limited liability shareholder companies,2 and through the promotion of joint ventures with private&#13;
MOF has recently established a separate Directorate General of State Enterprise Development. The Minister&#13;
of Finance also assigns certain of his SOE oversight responsibilities to the ministers responsible for technical&#13;
oversight.&#13;
There are now two forms of state enterprise in Indonesia, namely Persero and Perum. The Persero form is&#13;
based on the same legal code as private limited liability (PT) companies, and there is no legal restriction on&#13;
GOI divesting shares to the public. The Perum is based on a separate legal code that applies only to state&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
partners.  In recent years, there have been four partial divestitures, all involving industrial and&#13;
telecommunications enterprises. The fields of business of these four enterprises-PT Semen Gresik&#13;
(cement), PT Timah (tin mining), PT Indosat (international telecommunications), and PT Telkom&#13;
(domestic telecommunications)-are characterized by their not involving extensive loss-making&#13;
'social" missions.&#13;
1.17   GOI is now planning the phased partial divestiture of SOEs in other sectors, and MOF is&#13;
evaluating and prioritizing the more than 180 candidate enterprises. The pace of divestitures will be&#13;
determined by factors including the perceived institutional capacity of the GOI agencies concerned&#13;
and the absorptive capacities of the domestic and overseas share markets, while the choice of&#13;
enterprises will be influenced by their financial performance and by the nature and extent of their&#13;
"social" missions.' It is currently envisaged that there will be around three simultaneous listings on&#13;
international and domestic each year tor the next few years. PT Garuda Indonesia Airlines and PT&#13;
Jasa Marga have been tentativelv identified as the first priorities for listings among the transport&#13;
sector enterprises.&#13;
1.18   Concerted efforts are also being made to secure private participation  in infrastructure&#13;
provision through build-operate-transfer (BOT) and similar concession agreements between private&#13;
consortia and the concerned SOEs.  While these initiatives have attracted considerable private&#13;
interest, lack of clarity in sector strategies and lack of transparency in solicitation and negotiation&#13;
procedures has resulted in progress being slow and--in at least some instances--in costs being&#13;
unnecessarily high. Only a few major schemes involving foreign commercial financing have so far&#13;
achieved--or come close to--financial closure, with the electric power and telecommunications&#13;
sectors being at the forefront. In the transport sector. initiatives are most advanced with respect to&#13;
toll roads.  One toll road concessioni involvinig foreign commercial financing is now  nearing&#13;
financial closure, albeit after more thani seven years of planning and negotiation.&#13;
1.1 9   Legal Framework.  The basic legal framework for the sector comprises four modal&#13;
transport laws concerning respectively railways, road traffic and transport, civil aviation, and&#13;
maritime transport. These were enacted in 1 992 to replace old regulations that mostly dated back to&#13;
the I 920s and 1 930s. These ftour new laws, wlhich complement a law on road infrastructure enacted&#13;
in 1980, provide a more explicit legal basis for the policy reforms outlined above.  They are&#13;
designed to be implemented by government regulations (GRs) and subordinate ministerial decrees, a&#13;
process which is almost completed for the road traffic and transport law. For the other modes,&#13;
including rail, the planned GRs have now been drafted by MOC and are being discussed with other&#13;
concerned agencies.&#13;
owned enterprises, and that does not provide for ownership of equitv to be divisible into shares. The Persero&#13;
form is the more autonomous, and is used for those enterprises that are required to be profit-oriented. The&#13;
Perum forn is used for enterprises that are assigned significant social missions and that are required to cover&#13;
costs but not necessarily to seek profits. A third and still less autonomous form, the Perjan or departmental&#13;
agency, ceased to exist following the transformation of the railway enterprise, PJKA (PerJan Kereta Api), into&#13;
Perumka (Perum Kereta Api).&#13;
Article 33 of the Constitution states that branches of production that are important for the State and that affect&#13;
the lives of most people shall be controlled by the State. This article explains the extensive state participation&#13;
in sectors such as transport and provides a basis for assigning social missions to SOEs.&#13;

CHAPTER 2&#13;
PAST BANK INVOLVEMENT AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
A. PAST BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.1    The Bank has been substantially involved in Indonesia's transport sector during the past two&#13;
decades. Projects financed include four in the maritime sector (two for shipping and two for ports),&#13;
two fertilizer distribution projects, fifteen roads projects and two railway projects. At present four&#13;
roads projects are under implementation. Implementation Completion Reports prepared in recent&#13;
years include those for the Highway Betterment Project (Ln. 2404-IND), the Highway Maintenance&#13;
and Betterment Project (Ln. 2717-IND), the Second Rural Roads Development Project (Ln. 2881-&#13;
IND), the Railway Technical Assistance Project (Ln. 2891 -IND) and the Highway Sector Project (In.&#13;
31 33-IND). The last report by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) was a combined audit&#13;
report for the Highway Betterment and the Highway Maintenance and Betterment Projects.&#13;
2.2    The thrust of Bank lending has been in the road sector which is the dominant mode, and has&#13;
been directed at three broad objectives: (i) improving the quality of the road network through&#13;
maintenance, rehabilitation, improvements (e.g. minor widening) and new road construction; (ii)&#13;
developing the capability of the road agencies at central and regional level through technical support&#13;
and training and through improvements in planning and programming systems, in road construction&#13;
technologies, and in procedures for preparing, implementing and monitoring road works; and (iii)&#13;
improving key land transport sector policies and strengthening the capacity for transport and road&#13;
sector policy formulation and implementation. The latter is aimed at ensuring that the different&#13;
modes can play their proper role in the transport system.&#13;
2.3    Railway Projects.  In the railway sector Bank involvement has been less sustained, with&#13;
only two projects: the First Railway Project (1974) and the Railway Technical Assistance Project&#13;
(1987). The first project was designed to arrest the decline in the railway's share in land transport&#13;
and to increase its capacity and efficiency through a program of rehabilitation and modernization,&#13;
including a substantial amount of technical assistance and practical training. The project made a&#13;
valuable contribution and succeeded in its immediate objectives but had limited impact in improving&#13;
the institutional set-up. While passenger traffic increased, low tariffs resulted in continued losses&#13;
and the financial situation of the railway did not improve. The second project was more successful.&#13;
It aimed at beginning to restructure the railway and at strengthening management in a broad range of&#13;
areas including: information systems, costing, inventory control, train scheduling, rationalization of&#13;
mechanical and track maintenance, container operations and intermodal traffic. The project was&#13;
effective in providing practical training in modern railway management practices for a group of&#13;
middle-managers from whom many of the current top-level managers have been drawn.&#13;
2.4   Involvement in State Enterprises.  The Bank has also had extensive involvement with&#13;
state  enterprises  in  the  energy  and  telecommunications  sectors.   Recent energy  and&#13;
telecommunications projects have aimed at sectoral and institutional restructuring, at creating the&#13;
conditions for effective private sector entry and participation and at establishing and improving the&#13;
regulatory structures. These projects have been instrumental in bringing about needed reforms as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
evidenced by the Telecommunications Sector Modernization Project of 1995 which supported&#13;
sectoral legal and regulatory reform and expanded private participation.&#13;
B. MAIN LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
2.5    The main lessons leamed from the two railway projects in Indonesia are that turning around&#13;
a railway cannot be achieved on a piecemeal basis and requires addressing the many problems that&#13;
affect its performance.   Efforts should not only cover institutional changes, operational&#13;
improvements, and tariff revisions, but should be complemented by priority investments in track and&#13;
rolling stock. Furthermore, assuring the railway's financial viability requires setting in place robust&#13;
arrangements for governing the financial relationship between the railway and government and for&#13;
compensating the railway for public service obligations imposed on it by government.&#13;
2.6    An OED review in 1993 of Bank railway lending found that implementation of railway&#13;
projects generally fell short of expectations. The principal reasons for the shortcomings were: (i)&#13;
management's lack of sufficient authority over rates and other key matters; (ii) lack of a commercial&#13;
approach to the transport market; (iii) resistance to change in railway management, labor unions, and&#13;
government institutions; (iv) inefficient operations; (v) a lack of realism in forecasting traffic and&#13;
financial performance; (vi) reluctance by the Bank to penalize failure to comply with loan&#13;
covenants; and (viii) excessive reliance on loan covenants to achieve goals. The review emphasized&#13;
the need to reshape the railway as an institution, through disengagement from the government,&#13;
greater managerial autonomy and private participation in operations and management.&#13;
2.7    A review of the evolution of the World Bank's railway lending and of the railway&#13;
restructuring experience worldwide conducted in 1994 by the Transport Water and Urban&#13;
Development Department (TWUTD) concluded that change is possible and that the Bank can be&#13;
instrumental in the reform process. A key lesson is the need for a strong commitment to reform at&#13;
the highest levels of Government and the railway enterprise. Other important lessons from railway&#13;
reform in developed countries were that: (i) the functions of the railway need to be clarified and&#13;
divided into market-driven and socially driven (public service obligations) components; (ii) the&#13;
railway should be organized in profit centers along its lines of business; (iii) the railway needs&#13;
effective incentives and clear authority; (iv) there must be appropriate changes in regulation and&#13;
other government intervention; (v) barriers to change, such as redundant labor, excessive debt,&#13;
uneconomic trackage, or unsustainable retirement obligations, need to be removed; (vi) civil service&#13;
restrictions should be eased or lifted; (vii) reforms proceed better when a professional outside party&#13;
assists in the analysis and the development of proposals. Additional lessons from recent railway&#13;
reform efforts in developing countries are that: (i) adequate resources for planning and management&#13;
are essential as the administrative capability of the government can be overwhelmed by the many&#13;
complex railway restructuring issues; (ii) the Bank can not impose restructuring through loan&#13;
conditionality; and (iii) the western management model of assigning clear authority and&#13;
responsibility combined with delegation of decisions to the lowest feasible level may not be&#13;
appropriate in all cases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. BANK SECTOR STRATEGY AND RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.8    Bank Strategy. In transport the Bank's strategy is to assist GOI in developing an efficient&#13;
transport system capable of meeting the challenges of a rapidly growing economy, through: (i)&#13;
policy and institutional reforms which ensure that the transport modes play their proper role and with&#13;
effective private participation; (ii) rationalization of the sectoral investment programs and&#13;
improvements in operations; and (iii) the introduction of improved planning, programming and&#13;
implementation procedures in the context of projects financing a part of the sector investment&#13;
programs on a programmatic basis or by way of selective investments.&#13;
2.9    With regard to SOEs in key sectors of the Indonesian economy the Bank's strategy has&#13;
focussed on sectoral institutional and regulatory reform with the emphasis on privatization issues in&#13;
recent years. In the power and telecommunications sectors, a main objective is to establish an&#13;
improved regulatory framework for private sector participation, inter alia, by developing systems&#13;
and mechanisms for evaluating, regulating and managing entry of the private sector.&#13;
2.10   Rationale for Bank Involvement.  GOI is strongly committed to rail transport playing a&#13;
much expanded and more efficient role in the intercity transport system and to reducing its own&#13;
financing of the subsector's development. The former commitment is reflected in the amounts that it&#13;
plans to invest in the subsector during Repelita VI. The latter is evidenced by the compressed&#13;
timetable that it has adopted for the subsector restructuring agenda and the strong emphasis on&#13;
increased private participation.&#13;
2.11   GOI has asked the Bank to assist it with the reform of the sector. It considers the Bank to be&#13;
best equipped to provide such support given its considerable international experience with railway&#13;
restructuring and privatization, its extensive past and ongoing involvement in Indonesia's transport&#13;
sector, and its having supported the first phase of railway subsector restructuring through the&#13;
Railway Technical Assistance Project. The government, particularly Bappenas, and other lending&#13;
agencies also expect the Bank to assist in rationalizing the railway investment program.&#13;
2.12   The proposed project is an integral part of the Bank's support for land transport&#13;
infrastructure and is fully consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) which was last&#13;
discussed on March 21, 1995, and the Progress Report discussed on June 4, 1996, which emphasize&#13;
continued lending for infrastructure development and the need to maintain a substantial presence in&#13;
land transport to consolidate gains in operational efficiency and sector management.  A key&#13;
objective of railway sector lending is the establishment of an improved regulatory framework for&#13;
private sector participation.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
CHAPTER 3&#13;
THE RAILWAY SUBSECTOR&#13;
A. ORGANIZATION, MANAGEMENT AND REGULATION&#13;
3.1    Background. Prior to 1991, the Indonesian state railways were managed as a departmental&#13;
agency (Perjan) of MOC. Although classed as a state-owned enterprise, PJKA was not a separate&#13;
legal entity and its mission was considered to be primarily social. Its management was accorded&#13;
very limited autonomy, its budget formed part of MOC's budget, its annual targets were defined&#13;
primarily in terms of production rather than financial performance, and the tariffs for most services&#13;
were regulated at levels well below long-run variable cost.&#13;
3.2    During the latter years of Repelita IV (1984/85-1988/89), GOI recognized that fundamental&#13;
changes would be needed to enable rail transport to play its proper role in an efficient and&#13;
competitive transport system. Preparations for corporatization and commercialization commenced&#13;
and, with effect from January 1991, PJKA was transformed into Perumka.4 As a Perum enterprise,&#13;
Perumka is required to earn revenues sufficient at least to cover its costs.  In making the&#13;
transformation, GOI retained ownership of the "main railway infrastructure" - principally the track&#13;
and signals and the land on which they stand - while Perumka was assigned ownership of the&#13;
rolling stock, stations, and other assets, including valuable inner city land. Perumka was charged&#13;
with operating freight and passenger railway services, and also maintains and operates the main&#13;
railway infrastructure on behalf of GOI.5&#13;
3.3   This institutional structure is reflected in the recently enacted railway law, Law 13/92, which&#13;
defines the respective roles and responsibilities of government and state and private enterprises&#13;
broadly as follows:&#13;
a)  responsibility for guiding and supervising the development of railway transportation, and for&#13;
providing, maintaining and operating the main railway infrastructure is vested in GOI;&#13;
b)  responsibility for operating railway services is vested in a railway management entity (or&#13;
entities), which must be a state-owned enterprise;&#13;
c)  responsibility for developing, maintaining and operating the main railway infrastructure may be&#13;
delegated by GOI to a state-owned enterprise; and&#13;
d)  private entities may participate in railway-related activities by entering into cooperative&#13;
arrangements with the management entity.&#13;
4 The transformation was effected by Government Regulation 57 of 1990 (GR 57/90).&#13;
GOI retained ownership of the main infrastructure so as to place rail transport on a similar footing to road&#13;
transport, and to avoid Perumka's having to pay tax on the land upon which the track is laid. Responsibility&#13;
for main infrastructure maintenance and operation is implicitly delegated to Perumka by Minister of&#13;
Communications Decree 8 of 1991, although this decree does not stipulate which agency should be responsible&#13;
for the associated costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
There are some ambiguities in the Law's definitions and provisions, and also some inconsistencies&#13;
between these and the definitions and provisions of GR 57/90. These include differing definitions of&#13;
which assets are encompassed in the main railway infrastructure, and imprecise delineation of&#13;
responsibility for associated maintenance and operation costs.&#13;
3.4   As a Perum  enterprise, Perumka is legally permitted to borrow from domestic financial&#13;
institutions, to issue bonds, and to enter into cooperative agreements (based on revenue sharing) with&#13;
private entities. It is not, however, permitted to establish subsidiaries or to own shares in a joint&#13;
venture company.&#13;
3.5    Organization and Lines of Reporting. Perumka's basic internal organization structure and&#13;
lines of reporting to GOI are defined in GR 57/90 and reflect the provisions of the various laws and&#13;
6&#13;
regulations governing state-owned enterprises. The corporation, which is headquartered at Bandung&#13;
in West Java, is managed by a Board of Directors, comprising a Chief Director and four Directors.&#13;
The latter four are responsible for the directorates of Finance, Engineering, Operations, and&#13;
Personnel and Administration. Also reporting to the Chief Director are the heads of three other&#13;
headquarters units - Planning, Research and Development, Education and Training, and Internal&#13;
Audit - together with the heads of the Java Commercial Region (Wilayah Usaha) and the three&#13;
Sumatra Operating Regions (Wilayah). A chart summarizing Perumka's current organizational&#13;
structure is contained in Annex 3.1.&#13;
3.6   The Minister of Communications is charged with providing guidance to the Board of Directors&#13;
in the areas of general policy and planning, and with supervising its implementation. The Minister is&#13;
assisted in this task by a Board of Supervisors, comprising a Chairman plus up to four other&#13;
members, which reports through the Director General of Land Communications.' The principal&#13;
tasks of the Board of Supervisors are to evaluate Perumka's proposed annual workplan and budget,&#13;
and to monitor their implementation, and to identify where performance needs to be improved. The&#13;
Board of Supervisors is also required to report regularly to the Minister of Finance on matters&#13;
pertaining to Perumka's financial performance. The Perumka directors also communicate directly&#13;
with MOC's Secretariat General and DGLC on planning matters, and with MOF and Bappenas on&#13;
investment financing and budgeting matters.&#13;
3.7   Both the Board of Directors and the Board of Supervisors are appointed by the President on the&#13;
recommendation of the Minister of Communications, which is required to be made in consultation&#13;
with the Minister of Finance. The members of the Board of Supervisors are required to be&#13;
government officials, with at least one representative each from the Ministries of Communications&#13;
and Finance.&#13;
3.8   Regulation. Pending the promulgation of the implementing regulations for Law 13/92 (para&#13;
1.19), Perumka continues to be subject to numerous regulations issued under the umbrella of the&#13;
6   These most important of these are: Government Regulation 57 of 1990, which established Perumka; Law 13 of&#13;
1992 concerning Railways; Law 9 of 1969 concerning State-Owned Enterprises; and Government Regulation&#13;
3 of 1983 concerning the Guidance and Supervision of State-owned Enterprises.&#13;
The Director General of Land Communications is currently also the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
previous law. The main basis for the economic regulation of railway services is contained in GR&#13;
57/90 and Minister of Communications Decrees KM 3/90 and KM 8/91.&#13;
3.9    Law 13/92 empowers the Minister of Communications to regulate tariffs for certain classes&#13;
of passenger service, having regard to the opinion of the Minister of Finance.8  The current&#13;
classification of passenger services - Executive, Business, Economy, Urban, and Special (e.g.,&#13;
tourism charter) - is stipulated in KM 3/90. Economy and urban services are classified as "non-&#13;
commercial", and fares are subject to regulation by the Minister. All other passenger services and&#13;
freight services are classified as commercial. This decree also stipulates that the number of seats&#13;
provided for Executive, Business, and Special classes may not exceed 40% of total seat capacity.&#13;
3.10  In practice. Perumka currently has less autonomy over fare and rate-setting than the&#13;
regulations imply. Although empowered to set the fares for Executive and Business class services,&#13;
planned increases have been deferred on at least one occasion.9 Moreover, while freight rates are not&#13;
subject to regulation, Perumka's main freight customers are SOEs and GOI agencies, some of which&#13;
have been able to exert strong pressure for "strategic commodities" to be carried at less-than-&#13;
commercial rates.&#13;
B.  RAILWAY NETWORKS, ASSETS AND TRAFFIC&#13;
3.11  Indonesia has four unconnected railway systems, one on Java and three others on Sumatra.&#13;
Their combined length of track in operation is some 5,040 km, of which Java accounts for some&#13;
3,700 km. All are 1067 mm (3'6") gauge, and except for short double-track sections in the vicinity&#13;
of Jakarta and other major cities, the networks are single-track. Some sections in the greater Jakarta&#13;
metropolitan region (JABOTABEK) have been electrified to enable operation of suburban commuter&#13;
services by electric railcars.&#13;
3.12   Only some 19% of rail in the main tracks of Java is of the heavier weight type; 11% is 54 kg/m&#13;
and 8% is 50 kg/m. All this heavier rail has been laid since 1982. The lighter rail is 42 kg/m and 33&#13;
kg/m; the former accounts for about 50% of rail in the main tracks of Java and the latter 31%. The&#13;
lighter rail is quite old, some of it dates back to 1913 and none has been purchased since the 1970s.&#13;
Because the rail has not had sufficient maintenance, much of the older rail is in very poor condition.&#13;
Rail ends at the joints are often badly battered, some of which are beyond repair. There are other&#13;
defects as well, such as engine burns and corrugation, which should be repaired.&#13;
3.13   There are 13 different types of locomotives on Java ranging from 340 hp to 1825 hp. The total&#13;
fleet, excluding Jakarta's commuter services, consists of 381 locomotives, 227 of which are diesel&#13;
hydraulic and the rest being diesel electric. Except for 20 GE locomotives model CC201 (purchased&#13;
8   Law 13/92 stipulates that railway transport is to be developed and managed in the public interest as an integral&#13;
part of the national transport system with the goal of serving those passenger and freight traffics for which rail is&#13;
superior to other modes, having regard to factors such energy-use efficiency, land-use efficiency, safety, and&#13;
pollution.&#13;
The limits on seat shares for the higher class services have not been rigidly applied, and Perumka has, for&#13;
example, been permitted to operate executive class urban services whose tariffs are not stipulated by the&#13;
Minister. More generally, Perumka is now being encouraged to freeze the capacity of its economy services&#13;
and to introduce new higher fare "economy plus" services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12-&#13;
in 1992) and some 30 Henschel diesel hydraulic models BB303 and BB306 (purchased in 1978 and&#13;
1984, respectively), the rest of the fleet on Java is all more than 20 years old. The average fleet age&#13;
is approximately 30 years. The combination of ineffective scheduling, operational demand, a lack of&#13;
parts and inadequate skills has led to low availability rates (70% for some types) and high failure&#13;
rates (some 60 failures per one million kilometers). The taking of components or parts from one&#13;
locomotive to install on another is widespread.&#13;
3.14 There is a mix of mechanical and modern signaling systems on the main lines. The&#13;
mechanical systems were developed some 60 years ago. Maintenance has been reasonable for the&#13;
inside equipment, but not for the outside equipment. The condition of the wiring is very bad,&#13;
causing difficult operation of levers and confusing and unsafe signals (e.g., signal armns in half&#13;
position). The modern systems include the older model DRS60, which was installed in some&#13;
stations in the early 70's, and newer ones such as Genesis, MIS 801, VPI/CTC, SSI and&#13;
Westrace/CTC. Investments were made in such different systems because of the opportunities&#13;
provided under bilateral financing. This has created great difficulties for proper maintenance and&#13;
operation because staff must learn different technologies and systems and a large variety of spare parts&#13;
is required.&#13;
3.15 Perumka's total operating revenues amounted to Rp. 592 billion (about US$262 million)&#13;
in 1995 (Annex 6.1, Table 1). It is primarily a passenger railway, with passenger services&#13;
accounting for 66% of operating revenues.  In 1995, Perumka as a whole carried 129 million&#13;
passengers over an average distance of 121 km and 17 million tons of freight over an average haul of&#13;
244 km. Over the period of 1988/89 to 1995, passengers grew at an average rate of 15.7% per year,&#13;
and passenger-kilometers grew at 11.8% per year. Over the same period, freight tons increased at an&#13;
average rate of 8. 1 % per year and ton-kilometers increased at 9.2% per year.&#13;
3.16  Revenue contribution and traffic composition vary significantly among the four railway&#13;
systems (Figure 3-1). The Java Railway contributes about 75% of Perumka's total revenues. It is&#13;
primarily a passenger railway, with passengers accounting for 83% of its revenues. The South&#13;
Sumatra (S.S.) Railway generates some 20% of Perumka's total revenues, of which freight accounts&#13;
for 90%. The West Sumatra (W.S.) and North Sumatra (N.S.) railways contribute only 2% and 3%&#13;
of Perurnka's total revenues, of which freight accounts for 99% and 60%, respectively.&#13;

3.17  The Java Railway's core passenger traffic is intercity, long distance services, such as Jakarta-&#13;
Surabaya (820 km) and Jakarta-Yogyakarta (510 kmn), and medium distance services, such as&#13;
Jakarta-Bandung (180 km) and Jakarta-Cirebon (200 km). These services carried a total of 25.6&#13;
million passengers over an average distance of 380 km in 1994. They achieved a growth rate of&#13;
9.0% per year in passenger-kilometers from 1988/89 to 1994 and maintained high seat occupancy&#13;
rates, over 80% for executive and business classes and over 100% for many economy classes. The&#13;
executive and business classes serving the Jakarta-Bandung Corridor have proved particularly&#13;
successful. Competing with road transport, the two classes carry some 2.5 million passengers&#13;
annually with high quality services at premium tariffs, enjoying growth rates of 12.1% for the&#13;
executive class and 8.4% for the business class from 1987 to 1995. The Java Railway also carries&#13;
suburban passenger traffic. This segment has been growing especially fast, at an average rate of&#13;
21.2% per year in passenger-kilometers from 1988/89 to 1994 (Figure 3-2). The rapid growth&#13;
experienced in the intercity and suburban rail passenger traffic has been driven by the steadily rising&#13;
urban population and income and deteriorating road congestion and pollution. As these forces&#13;
should remain dominant in the future development, this traffic is expected to continue to grow&#13;
strongly.&#13;
3.18  The freight traffic moved by the Java Railway consists mostly of petroleum fuel, fertilizer,&#13;
cement, coal, and containers, totaling 1.4 billion ton-kilometers in 1994. Some 85% of this traffic is&#13;
from state-owned enterprises at less than commercial rates. Due to the short hauls and intense water&#13;
and road competition, the rail freight traffic grew only at about 2.3% per year in ton-kilometers over&#13;
1988/89 to 1994. While there will still be scope for large volume point-to-point flows, e.g., fertilizer,&#13;
cement, etc., the growth potential is limited as privatization and commercial reform proceeds among&#13;
an increasing number of state enterprises and as railway freight tariffs move to compensatory levels.&#13;

3.19 The South Sumatra Railway's dominant traffic is coal, which is moved from the Bukit Asam&#13;
mine at Tanjung Enim to Tarahan (for onward shipment to the Suralaya power station on Java) and&#13;
to Kertapati (Palembang). Growing at over 20% per year from 1988/89 to 1994, this traffic reached&#13;
1.9 billion ton-kilometers in 1994, higher than the total freight traffic moved over the Java railway&#13;
and accounting for 48% of the total freight carried by Perumka. There are plans to significantly&#13;
expand the capacity of the Suralaya power station during the next decade.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
3.20  Freight traffic on the other two Sumatra railways, West and North, registered small growth&#13;
rates, 4.4% and 1.8%, respectively, per year from 1988/89 to 1994 (Figure 3-2). The West Sumatra&#13;
Railway carries mostly coal and cement. Coal is moved from the mines at Ombilin (Parambahan) to&#13;
the terminal at Teluk Bayur and to the cement plant at Indarung. Bulk cement is moved from&#13;
Indarung to Teluk Bayur. The North Sumatra Railway's main traffic is crude palm oil, most of&#13;
which is carried on behalf of several state plantation companies to the tank farm at Belawan port.&#13;
The growth potential for these two railways is limited.&#13;
C.   OPERATIONS&#13;
3.21  As part of project preparation, Perumka's railway operations were studied by consultants.&#13;
Key findings include the following:&#13;
*     Economic Role of the Railway. Valuable rail transport capacity is being used to meet&#13;
demand in markets which are unable and unwilling to pay compensatory prices for rail services.&#13;
Thus, money-losing freight traffic on Java consumes nearly half the capacity of the track and the&#13;
locomotive fleet.&#13;
*     Safety of Operation. Based on field inspections of various track sections, the consultant&#13;
found that "parts of the system are not safe." This is partly due to deferred maintenance; the&#13;
estimated backlog of track maintenance is Rp.75 billion (US$34 million). But maintenance funds&#13;
are not being applied as effectively as they could be.&#13;
*     Proper Allocation Between Investment and Maintenance. When Perumka was formed,&#13;
the appropriate compensation mechanism for infrastructure use and maintenance was not set up, so&#13;
that incentive is lacking for cost effective maintenance of assets to realize their full economic life.&#13;
For example, instead of a one-time investment of Rp. 211 billion (US$96 million) in track&#13;
rehabilitation, the consultant recommended that Perumka's annual track maintenance budget be&#13;
increased by Rp. 50 billion (US$23 million). Rolling stock maintenance also has been underfunded,&#13;
leading to uneconomic proposals for rehabilitation of locomotives, for example.&#13;
*     Management, Supervision, and  Organization.   Responsibilities, authorities, and&#13;
accountabilities of managers and supervisors need to be more clearly defined, and the Java operating&#13;
organization needs to be simplified. In addition, extensive changes are required in operating and&#13;
maintenance regulations and rules, in investment prioritization, and in marketing. If these changes&#13;
do not accompany the proposed reforms at the institutional level and the investments, Perumka will&#13;
not be able to handle the anticipated growth in traffic and play an expanded role in the growing&#13;
transportation market.&#13;
3.22  Perumka's combined operations on Java and South Sumatra have been compared to the&#13;
railways of Thailand, Sri Lanka, Austria, and Belgium for 1994 (Annex 3.3). The overall conclusion&#13;
of the analysis is that Perumka ranks relatively high in terms of physical measures of asset&#13;
utilization. But mainly due to low passenger fares, the revenue earnings of its physical assets are&#13;
inadequate and significantly lower than the railways in Austria and Belgium. Perumka's low revenue&#13;
relative to its assets is significant since most of the investment and repair cost of track, locomotives,&#13;
and multiple unit power cars consists of material that is at least as expensive in Indonesia as it is in&#13;
Austria and Belgium. Labor productivity compares more favorably: Perumka's combined annual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
passenger and ton kilometers per employee is lower than that of Thailand but significantly better&#13;
than that of the other three comparators.&#13;
D.   FINANCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
3.23 Accounting and Auditing. Until 1990, the railway was a departmental agency (Perjan)&#13;
(para 3. 1), with its incomes and expenditures treated as part of the State Income and Expenditure&#13;
Budget. As part of its conversion to a Perum, the major part of the railway infrastructure remained&#13;
the property of the Government, with Perumka retaining only that part associated with service&#13;
buildings (workshops, depots, etc.), housing, facilities such as telecommunications, electricity and&#13;
water and the related land. This had two financial impacts on the railway: (i) the introduction of an&#13;
annual payment from the Government to Perumka to contribute to the cost of maintaining the&#13;
Government-owned infrastructure; and (ii) a large reduction in the infrastructure-related assets and&#13;
an associated reduction in the depreciation and interest charges.&#13;
3.24  Perumka uses the double-entry accounting system. During the late 1980s a new and&#13;
improved accounting system was progressively introduced and in 1990 the fiscal year was changed&#13;
from April/March to January/December. The classification of accounts was revised to integrate cost&#13;
and financial accounting. As a result costs can be analyzed by type of expenses (material, labor, and&#13;
general), by cost center (e.g., locomotive depot) and by operating function (e.g., locomotive&#13;
maintenance). Wages are allocated to activities according to data recorded on time-sheets/rosters.&#13;
The reporting system has been computerized and the reporting formats have been suitably designed.&#13;
The upgraded accounting system follows generally accepted accounting principles and practices.&#13;
With financing under the Bank's Railway Technical Assistance Project, a traffic costing system was&#13;
introduced and some management/cost accounting is now undertaken. However, the scope and level&#13;
of analysis could be improved and this is recognized by Perumka. For example, the costs only&#13;
include direct and indirect operating costs and the calculation of depreciation charges should be based&#13;
on replacement costs.&#13;
3.25  Perumka's accounts are audited annually by the Financial and Development Supervisory Board&#13;
of the Government (Badan Rengwas Keerangan dar Pembangunan - BPKP). The auditors are&#13;
regarded as independent auditors using generally accepted auditing rules and standards. Perumka's&#13;
audited accounts, however, are issued as late as nine months after the end of the fiscal year. This is&#13;
too long a delay for management review to enable it to take remedial actions when necessary.&#13;
Closing of the books and their auditing need to be accelerated so as to produce the audited report not&#13;
later than six months after the close of the fiscal year. During negotiations, agreement was reached&#13;
that Perumka 's audited accounts for FY1996 and 97 will be produced by September 30, 1997 and&#13;
1998 respectively, andfor subsequent years by June 30 of each year (para 4.51).&#13;
3.26  Perumka's Financial Performance. Financial statements for 1991-95 are presented and&#13;
evaluated in Annex 6.1, tables I and 2. Key results are summarized in Table 3-1 below.&#13;

v Operating revenues include GOI's annual contribution of Rp. 22.0 billion for 1991 and Rp. 31.5 billion per year&#13;
for 1992 to 1995 for infrastructure maintenance and operation.&#13;
3.27 Perumka's financial performance has shown some improvement. Revenues have covered or&#13;
come close to covering its recorded operating costs, with revenue increases during the period being&#13;
closely matched by cost increases. Consequently, the operating ratio has improved slightly from&#13;
102% in 1991 to 98% in 1995. Without further improvement, Perumka would not be able to service&#13;
its debt obligations and pay taxes and dividends to the Government. Also, in considering these&#13;
results, it must be noted that: (a) GOI's contribution towards the costs of infrastructure maintenance&#13;
(which is delegated to Perumka) is inadequate; (b) maintenance of rolling stock has been&#13;
underfunded; and (c) Perumka's depreciation charges are based on the historical cost of asset&#13;
acquisition.&#13;
3.28   The slow improvement in the operating ratio masks some significant changes that have&#13;
occurred during the five years since Perumka was established. On the cost side, labor productivity&#13;
has increased by 51%,IO due to the combination of traffic growth and reduction in total staff&#13;
numbers." However, this has been offset by personnel costs having doubled during the same period&#13;
due to a combination of general and specific wage and salary increases. Consequently, labor cost&#13;
increased from 31% of working costs in 1991 to 36% in 1995. Despite these increases, the salary&#13;
levels for middle and senior level staff remain below those in the private sector. Other costs have&#13;
generally increased in line with domestic inflation which has been in the range of 7.5%-10% per&#13;
annum over the period.&#13;
IC Traffic units (passenger-km + freight ton-km) per staff member has risen from 306,000 in 1991 to 462,000 in&#13;
1995.&#13;
A reduction in PJKA's staffing was covenanted in the Loan Agreement for the Railway Technical Assistance&#13;
Project (Loan 2891-IND). OED Report 13914 dated March 6, 1995 discusses the importance and difficulty of&#13;
right-sizing the railway labor force.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
3.29   On the revenue side, Perumka has for various reasons been unable to raise tariffs to levels&#13;
that would cover its variable costs computed on a commercial "going concern" basis. The Land&#13;
Transport Phase 11 Study (LTDP) in 1992 estimated cost recovery for various categories of traffic&#13;
and the findings remain generally valid. Tariffs for economy passenger services covered short-run&#13;
avoidable costs but fell short of covering the costs of renewing track and rolling stock (long-run&#13;
avoidable costs) 2. Under "efficient" operations, passenger revenues would cover fully distributed&#13;
costs but still would make only a nominal contribution. For commercial passenger traffic the&#13;
situation is much better with first class passengers covering full costs, including a return on assets.&#13;
3.30   Freight revenues. by contrast, fail to cover even short-run avoidable costs. Perumka's latest&#13;
analyses find that the only freight traffic covering variable costs and some contribution to fixed&#13;
costs are Suralaya coal in South Sumatra and fuel to Solo in Java. The only traffic covering direct&#13;
cost (train operations, fuel and rolling stock maintenance) are other coal in South Sumatra,&#13;
containers to and from Bandung, fuel to Cepu and steel from Cilegon to Surabaya. All other traffic&#13;
(including fertilizer, cement and sand) are not covering direct costs.&#13;
3.31   Since 1991, average revenue for passenger services has increased overall by 43.0% from Rp.&#13;
15.1 per pass-km 1991 to Rp. 21.6 per pass-km in 1995, reflecting a mix change, since the increase&#13;
for economy class services was only 26.5%. Aggregate price inflation over the same period totaled&#13;
35.3%.&#13;
3.32   Perumka's inability to increase tariffs is due to a combination of: (a) explicit regulation of&#13;
fares for economy and suburban passenger services, which are in general now below the fares of&#13;
competing bus services; (b) implicit regulation of fares for premium passenger services and&#13;
negotiated rates for bulk freight services, for which market conditions would in many instances&#13;
permit significant increases; and (c) non-competitiveness of many low density short and medium&#13;
distance passenger services and of general and small volume bulk freight services.,3 So, while there&#13;
is potential to increase tariffs on a number of services if Perumka were able to market and price its&#13;
services on purely commercial grounds, such a commercial approach would also bring it to&#13;
discontinue many services that are non-remunerative.&#13;
E.  SUBSECTOR INVESTMENT PLANNING&#13;
3.33   Since the late 1960s, GO] has adopted a centralized and highly structured system  of&#13;
development planning which has been subject to progressive improvement and refinement over time.&#13;
Development plans are prepared for the long-term (25 years) and the medium term (five years), and&#13;
12 Short-run avoidable costs (SRAC) comprise the operating and maintenance costs that would be saved if the&#13;
service were to be withdrawn. This is an appropriate measure to use where there is excess capacity in&#13;
infrastructure and rolling stock. Long-run avoidable costs (LRAC) comprise SRAC plus the costs of rolling&#13;
stock provision and infrastructure renewals. This is an appropriate measure to use when there is spare capacity&#13;
in infrastructure but not rolling stock. "Efficient" costs are the costs that would be achieved if best practices&#13;
were employed to operate the system.&#13;
13  To bridge the gap between rising costs and inadequate tariffs, passenger fares were increased by 28% for&#13;
economy class and 14% for executive and business class effective early April 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
are designed to realize the goals and implement the policies outlined in the GBHN. The plans are&#13;
compiled by Bappenas and promulgated by Presidential Decree.'4&#13;
3.34   The development planning process combines top-down and bottom-up approaches. The top-&#13;
down framework is provided by the GBHN, and by initial macro-economic projections and outline&#13;
sectoral and regional goals, strategies, and parameters developed by Bappenas in consultation with&#13;
the concerned line ministries and regional authorities. Individual ministries, SOEs, and regional&#13;
governments then draft more specific targets and strategies for their respective sectors, subsectors&#13;
and regions, and formulate draft development programs for their realization. In the final stages,&#13;
these draft goals and programs plans are integrated through intensive inter-agency discussions.&#13;
During this process, the initial investment proposals are usually cut back and amended to align with&#13;
projected financing capacity and refined sectoral and regional priorities.&#13;
3.35   The resultant development plans are static in the sense that targets are not subject to revision&#13;
during the plan period and are considered binding on the government agencies and SOEs charged&#13;
with their implementation. While they are intended to provide a framework for both the public and&#13;
private sectors, the nature and content of development programs naturally differs considerably&#13;
between sectors such as industry, where new investment is mostly private, and public works, where&#13;
GOI finances the major share.&#13;
3.36   Up until the end of Repelita V, all investment in the railway subsector was financed by GOI.&#13;
The Repelita VI plan envisages increased private participation in the railway subsector, and the&#13;
investments estimated to be needed to achieve the plan's overall traffic growth target rate of 14% per&#13;
year are expected to be financed by GOI, Perumka and the private sector . The development&#13;
program for railway transport accordingly includes specific physical targets and associated cost&#13;
estimates for the various categories of investments."  The total investment needs are estimated at&#13;
just under Rp 3 trillion in nominal prices (equivalent to US$1.3 billion at current exchange rates). 6&#13;
Most of this is allocated for main infrastructure development, including for the further development&#13;
of the JABOTABEK commuter network, and the remainder is for rolling stock.&#13;
3.37   As of March 1996, the Repelita VI investment plan for the railways (1994-95 through 1998-&#13;
99) consists of Rp. 2,963 billion of projects for which the financing has already been arranged.&#13;
These projects are committed to be carried out and represent the "core" of any investment plan for&#13;
Repelita VI.  The committed projects include Rp. 1,347 billion of projects for JABOTABEK&#13;
April 1994 marked the start of the Second Long-Term Development Plan (PJP-II) and the Sixth Five-Year&#13;
Development Plan (Repelita VI). Their preparation formally commenced in April 1993 following the&#13;
quinquennial meeting of the Peoples Consultative Assembly (MPR), whose activities culminated in March&#13;
1993 with the issue of the GBHN and the election of the President. The plans and the first-year budgets were&#13;
prepared according to a schedule that enabled implementation to commence in April 1994.&#13;
15 The main categories comprise: construction of new track; improvement and rehabilitation of existing track;&#13;
improvement and rehabilitation of bridges; modernization of signaling; procurement and rehabilitation of&#13;
locomotives, coaches, and railcars and wagons; and feasibility and engineering studies.&#13;
16 Perumka estimates that a significantly higher level of investment is needed to achieve these traffic growth&#13;
targets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
suburban services (45%), Rp. 571 billion of signal modernization projects on Java outside&#13;
JABOTABEK (19%), and other projects (Annex 3.4).&#13;
3.38   A  significant percentage of the committed projects for Repelita VI, especially in the&#13;
categories of signal modernization and  locomotive rehabilitation, may have less economic&#13;
justification than other projects for which funds have not been committed. For this reason there is&#13;
merit in taking a more integrated "corridor" or "systemwide" approach in the future to planning for&#13;
the expansion and modernization of railway capacity.7&#13;
3.39  In planning for infrastructure investments GOI and Perumka have already initiated a "corridor"&#13;
approach. Under this approach corridor development is prioritized based on traffic volumes and&#13;
projections and all future investments and actions to increase capacity in a corridor are planned in a&#13;
coordinated manner in particular as regards the sequencing of signaling and track investments. This&#13;
approach will be further strengthened and improved, inter alia, through careful evaluation of likely&#13;
traffic demand and capacity and its development will be supported under the project.&#13;
3.40  At negotiations agreement was reached with GOI that it will annually: (i) furnish to the Bank&#13;
by September 30 a draft "core" railway infrastructure investment plan, prepared using cost/benefit&#13;
analyses carried out on a corridor approach and taking into account Perumka 's corporate plan; and&#13;
(ii) finalize the "core "plan taking into account the Bank's comments.&#13;
F.  PERUMKA CORPORATE PLANNING&#13;
3.41   Perumka maintains a rolling medium-term  (five-year) Corporate Plan.  This is updated&#13;
annually taking account of objectives and constraints set by GOI. The plan is comprehensive and&#13;
detailed, and reflects a sound understanding of the passenger and freight transport markets in the&#13;
regions served by rail, of the factors that influence mode choice, and of the costs of its services.&#13;
3.42 The usefulness of the current plan is, however, limited. Firstly, the externally imposed&#13;
objectives and constraints are inconsistent inasmuch as it is not possible to meet the traffic growth&#13;
and profit goals with the permitted tariffs and expected investment levels. Secondly, the plan does&#13;
not constitute an agreement between Perumka management and GOI, as GOI has not committed&#13;
itself to making the projected investment financing available, nor has it permitted the assumed tariff&#13;
increases. 18Consequently, Perumka's management cannot be held accountable for delivering the&#13;
plan outputs.&#13;
3.43   The shortcomings of the corporate plan, are attributable to the nature of the Repelita&#13;
planning process to which it is linked. In common with other subsectors, growth targets tend to be&#13;
17 The railway corridor is a convenient way to group the railway resources that can be associated with the various&#13;
transport markets between pairs of origins and destinations. The market-oriented "corridor" approach to&#13;
railway planning was taken by GOI and Perumka in planning the improvements in the Jakarta-Bandung&#13;
Corridor under this project. In addition to corridor-based projects, there also are projects whose planning&#13;
requires a systemwide approach, and two examples are the development of a track maintenance system and a&#13;
locomotive unit exchange maintenance system under this project.&#13;
18 Perumka updates its Corporate Plan annually, but not all updates are subject to review by GOI. The last plan&#13;
reviewed was that covering the Repelita VI period (1994/95-1998/99).&#13;

not revised downwards when financing allocations are reduced. Repelita targets cannot be amended&#13;
by Perumka or MOC as they are established by Presidential Decree, and corporate plans are&#13;
expected to provide for their realization.  Perumka accordingly maintains an alternative plan&#13;
scenario based on what it considers to be feasible assumptions. This forms the basis for the "Core&#13;
Plan" underlying the financial projections of Chapter 6.&#13;
3.44  In future years this "Core Plan" will not only need to be updated but may be subject to major&#13;
modification on account of: (i) the implementation of the government's policies for the sector: (ii)&#13;
the implementation of Perumka's emerging business strategy developed by taking into account the&#13;
comparative advantage of railway transport compared to other modes; (iii) the impact of efficiency&#13;
improvements; and (iv) the impact of possible private participation. At negotiations agreement was&#13;
reached that Perumka will annuallv (i) furnish to the Bank/fbr its review and c-mment by September&#13;
30 its draft corporate plan and associated core investment plan, preparedl taking into account its&#13;
financial situation, updated ira,ffic forecasts, operational efficiency, available rolling stock and other&#13;
pertinent factors; and (ii) finalize and carry out the corporate plan and associated core investment&#13;
plan taking into account the Bank's commentsv.&#13;
G.  PRIVATE PARTICIPATION&#13;
3.45   Since the early 1990s, GOI has actively encouraged private participation in the railway&#13;
subsector, and Perumka in consultation with MOC has developed basic procedures for processing a&#13;
limited range of private proposals.'9 More recently, GR 20/94 has permitted foreign investment in&#13;
the subsector. The forms of participation so far permitted are joint operations (with profit-sharing&#13;
based on assets), contract management, concessions (principally for shop and other service&#13;
businesses at stations), and leases/rentals of Perumka property. Specific reference is made to Built,&#13;
Operate and Transfer (BOT), Build, Own and Operate (BOO), and Build, Operate and Lease (BOL)&#13;
schemes, but only in the context of commercial property development of Perumka land.&#13;
3.46  No attempt has yet been made to solicit private proposals for specific well-defined projects,&#13;
but numerous unsolicited expressions of interest have been received.  Most of these involve&#13;
development of Perumka's inner city land assets, and there have so far been few well developed&#13;
proposals for investments in the provision of railway services or in supporting businesses. Those&#13;
services and businesses that have attracted private interest mostly have monopoly characteristics,&#13;
although Perumka is currently operating one train service in cooperation with a private group.20&#13;
H.    KEY ISSUES&#13;
3.47   While the overall performance of the inter-city railway system has improved significantly&#13;
since 1990, when the initial subsector reforms commenced, GOI recognizes that much still remains&#13;
to be done if railway transport is to play its proper role within an efficiently functioning transport&#13;
These are set out in Board of Directors Decree KA/UP/21458/91 of August 1991.&#13;
20 This is the recently commenced daily container train service between Jakarta and Surabaya. It has involved a&#13;
comparatively small private investment and, unlike most proposed private projects, faces intense competition&#13;
from road and Ro-Ro shipping.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
system. Accordingly in 1995, DGLC commissioned railway management consultants to evaluate the&#13;
adequacy of the current institutional and regulatory framework and to recommend improvements. In&#13;
parallel, Perumka commissioned a consultant team to review and recommend improvements to the&#13;
medium-term performance improvement and investment plan.2'&#13;
3.48  The consolidated findings of these studies and of Bank missions confirm that a combination&#13;
of inter-linked external and internal problems outside the control of Perumka's directors are&#13;
constraining the efficiency and quality of railway services and impeding growth.  The more&#13;
important of these are described briefly below.&#13;
3.49 Interfaces between GOI and Perumka. The interfaces between GOI and Perumka are&#13;
poorly structured and defined, particularly on matters involving regulation, financing, and&#13;
infrastructure development and management. Consequently, accountability is diluted and Perumka's&#13;
directors and senior managers must devote excessive time to meetings in Jakarta with the many GOI&#13;
agencies involved.&#13;
3.50   Subsector Corporate Structure. Indonesia's railway system does not lend itself to being&#13;
managed effectively as a monolithic Perum corporation. The four railway networks are widely&#13;
separated geographically and the nature and sizes of the markets they serve are very different. The&#13;
Java Railway alone is a large and diversified enterprise whose main businesses include freight&#13;
services, interurban passenger services, JABOTABEK commuter services, and urban property&#13;
development.&#13;
3.51   Perumka Internal Organization. Perumka's organization structure has too many layers&#13;
and compartments. Work practices are outdated and lines of reporting and accountability are poorly&#13;
defined in many areas. Headquarters and regional offices are structured along functional rather than&#13;
business lines, and responsibility for some key activities, such as locomotive maintenance, is divided&#13;
22&#13;
between directorates.  The individual railways are managed essentially as cost centers, and there is&#13;
little incentive for entrepreneurial initiative. The result is a production-oriented culture in which&#13;
only the Principal Director has a clear profit responsibility.&#13;
3.52   Staffing. Perumka has more staff than needed for its current level of activity, although&#13;
continued fast traffic growth coupled with natural attrition is helping to address this. At the same&#13;
time, it has insufficient qualified and experienced technical and managerial personnel.  Thus&#13;
personnel remain in positions that should have been eliminated following investments in electronic&#13;
signaling and centralized train control, but recruiting and retaining technicians to maintain this&#13;
21  "Further Institutional Development of Indonesia's Railway Subsector" (Executing agency: DGLC; Consultant:&#13;
CPCS et al), and "Review and Prioritization of the Performance Improvement and Investment Plan for the&#13;
Indonesian State Railways" (Executing Agency: Perumka; Consultant: CANAC et al). Both studies were&#13;
financed under the Technical Assistance Project for the Public and Private Provision of Infrastructure (Loan&#13;
3385-IND).&#13;
22  The top level organization of Perum corporations has, by established convention, been along functional lines.&#13;
While some changes to PJKA's top-level structure were made at the time of its transformation to Perumka, the&#13;
lower level structure remained largely unchanged. The organization of locomotive maintenance, whereby the&#13;
Director of Engineering is responsible for workshops and the Director of Operations for line depots, has its&#13;
origins in the era of the steam locomotive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
equipment have proven difficult. These problems stem both from limited managerial autonomy on&#13;
staffing and personnel compensation measures and from outdated operating regulations and work&#13;
practices.&#13;
3.53  Economic Regulation and Public Service Obligations. Explicit and implicit regulation of&#13;
passenger fares and freight rates results in the revenues for most rail services being below the costs&#13;
of provision. While fares for long distance economy services generally cover short-run avoidable&#13;
costs, they do not cover the costs of capital renewal. On the freight side, only a few bulk freight&#13;
services and one container train service currently cover short-run avoidable costs (paras 3.29-30).&#13;
GOI does not provide direct compensation to Perumka for losses incurred, but has in the past&#13;
financed most rolling stock investments through equity increases.&#13;
3.54  Infrastructure Provision. Blurred responsibilities for most aspects of railway infrastructure&#13;
23&#13;
provision result in poor investment and maintenance decisions.   Responsibility for planning new&#13;
investments is shared between DGLC and Perumka and is conducted in a fragmented manner.&#13;
Consequently, many proposed projects appear premature, sub-optimal in concept, or otherwise not&#13;
well justified. GOI finances all main infrastructure investments, and has contributed a fixed annual&#13;
amount (Rp. 31.5 billion or around US$14 million at current exchange rates) towards the costs of&#13;
operation and maintenance. Perumka is permitted to use the infrastructure free of charge, but is&#13;
required to bear the balance of the operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs.&#13;
3.55  Financing of Maintenance Expenditures.  Systematic under-funding of maintenance is&#13;
accelerating the deterioration of track and rolling stock, reducing rolling stock availability and&#13;
productivity, and ultimately requiring GOI to finance premature rehabilitation or replacement&#13;
investments. Perumka is required to earn a profit and, with limited powers to increase tariffs, is&#13;
forced to cut costs. Maintenance is the budget item that is most readily cut and, rather than being&#13;
computed on the basis of needs, is now necessarily treated as a balancing or residual item.&#13;
3.56  Technology Choices. Railway investment decisions are often driven by suppliers who are&#13;
able to arrange concessional financing, rather than by soundly based plans and appropriate technical&#13;
standards. This has resulted in the acquisition of assets that are not truly needed or well suited to&#13;
their purpose, in higher capital costs, and more generally in a proliferation of equipment types. Thus,&#13;
for example, there are now three different families of electronic signaling systems installed in Java,&#13;
thereby exacerbating maintenance problems and potentially posing increased safety risks.&#13;
3.57  Corporate Planning. The shortcomings in Perumka's corporate plans have been touched&#13;
upon above. The main problem concerns inconsistencies in the externally imposed objectives and&#13;
constraints rather than Perumka's corporate planning approach, which is basically sound.&#13;
3.58  Competition. GOI's transport sector policies are essentially sound, but shortcomings in&#13;
their application and enforcement are tilting the playing field of inter-modal competition. The&#13;
distortions sometimes work in opposite directions, but are not necessarily self-canceling. Thus, slow&#13;
implementation of GOI's adopted road user charges policy and lax enforcement of vehicle weight&#13;
and dimension limits enable truck operators to secure heavy freight traffic that would be more&#13;

billion per year.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
efficiently moved by rail. Conversely, low regulated fares coupled with compensating capital&#13;
subsidies from GOI have enabled rail to carry short- and medium-distance low density passenger&#13;
traffic that would be better served by bus.&#13;
1.    THE GOVERNMENT'S RESTRUCTURING AGENDA&#13;
3.59  These findings and the associated recommendations were considered by MOC and Perumka&#13;
in a series of high level meetings held during the latter half of 1995. There was early general&#13;
agreement on the diagnosis, and attention focused mainly on defining measures for overcoming the&#13;
identified problems. This process culminated in the formulation of a policy framework, consistent&#13;
with GBHN and Law 13/92, to govern the second phase in the subsector's restructuring (Annex 3.5).&#13;
3.60 GOI (the Coordinating Ministry for the Economy and Finance (Ekkuwasbang), MOC, MOF&#13;
and Bappenas) has developed a time-based action plan for implementing these policies (Annex 3.6).&#13;
An Inter-Agency Coordinating Committee (IACC) was established in March 1996 to guide and&#13;
monitor the implementation of the policies and, concurrently, to act as the Steering Committee for&#13;
the Railway Efficiency Project. Subsequently, a Restructuring Task Force (RTF), reporting to the&#13;
Committee, to manage the preparations for Perumka's conversion to Persero status was also&#13;
established. The policy framework and action plan for restructuring the railway sector with the view&#13;
of increasing its efficiency are sound and appropriate. They provide the basis for the project and will&#13;
be supported by the project. Key actions in the main areas are outlined below.&#13;
3.61  Compensation for Public Service Obligations.  GOI will in future compensate Perumka&#13;
directly and transparently for the "public service obligation" (PSO) or "non-commercial" traffics -&#13;
principally economy class passenger services - which it is required to operate at regulated fares and&#13;
rates (Annex 3.7). In parallel, GOI will cease financing Perumka's investments in rolling stock and&#13;
other assets. GOI is concerned to ensure that PSO compensation does not subsidize inefficiency or&#13;
enable Perumka to continue operating services that would be more economically served by other&#13;
modes. Accordingly, compensation amounts will be carefully negotiated on the basis of the&#13;
regulated tariffs and well-supported estimates of load factors and efficient operating costs.&#13;
3.62 The first PSO compensation payment will be made to Perumka under the 1997/98 State&#13;
Budget. Perumka has been instructed to: (a) develop and discuss with MOC, MOF and Bappenas, a&#13;
proposed methodology and parameters for computing PSO compensation payments; and (b) prepare&#13;
and present a draft budget proposal for the 1997/98 payment based on the agreed methodology and&#13;
parameters. GOI has also decided that in subsequent years: (a) Perumka will be required to prepare&#13;
by June 30 a report evaluating the implementation of the PSO mechanism; (b) proposals for PSO&#13;
compensation will be subject to very rigorous scrutiny and be developed in the light of experience&#13;
during previous years; and (c) tariffs and rates should in general be raised to commercial levels and&#13;
uncompetitive services withdrawn as rapidly as is practicable so as to quickly reduce the need for&#13;
PSO compensation. These arrangements were confirmed at negotiations.&#13;
3.63  Compensation for Infrastructure Maintenance and Operation Costs. GOI will in future&#13;
compensate Perumka through the State Budget for the costs it incurs in improving, maintaining and&#13;
operating the main railway infrastructure on GOI's behalf. The amount of the annual infrastructure&#13;
maintenance and operation budget will be carefully computed on the basis of the estimated efficient&#13;
costs of specific works needed and/or of maintaining and operating the infrastructure to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
appropriately defined standards. Perumka will be accountable for demonstrating that the funds so&#13;
provided have been used effectively and efficiently for the purposes intended.&#13;
3.64   The first infrastructure maintenance and operation payment will be made to Perumka under&#13;
the 1997/98 State Budget. Perumka has been instructed to: (a) develop and discuss with MOC, MOF&#13;
and Bappenas, a proposed methodology and parameters for computing infrastructure maintenance&#13;
and operation costs; and (b) prepare a draft budget for the 1997/98 payment based on the agreed&#13;
methodology and parameters. In subsequent years: (a) Perumka will be required to prepare by June&#13;
30 an annual report evaluating the implementation of the mechanism; and (b) the maintenance and&#13;
compensation payment will be carefully developed in the light of experience during previous years.&#13;
These arrangements were confirmed at negotiations.&#13;
3.65  Financing of Perumka Investments. GOI is already requiring Perumka to finance some&#13;
rolling stock investments from internal sources and borrowings. This policy is now being made&#13;
more stringent and Perumka will be required in future to finance all new investments from internal&#13;
sources and borrowings. Any foreign funds provided by GOI for the financing of Perumka assets&#13;
under loan agreements will be on-lent to Perumka on commercial terms. At negotiations agreement&#13;
was reached that GOI shall not provide to Perumka, whether directly or indirectll, any funds or&#13;
financing other than.' (i) loans on terms no more favorable than those availahle from commercial&#13;
lenders; and (ii) payments in accordance with the public service obligation compensation and the&#13;
infrastructure maintenance compensation mechanisms.&#13;
3.66  Track Access Charges System. In parallel to the above compensation mechanisms, GOI&#13;
will implement a system of track access charges, to apply equally to Perumka and private operators&#13;
of railway services, for the recovery of infrastructure provision costs. Perumka has been instructed&#13;
to prepare proposals for the design and phased implementation of a track access charges system.&#13;
Following the review and, if necessary, amendment of these proposals. GOI will arrange for its&#13;
implementation to commence from April 1, 1997. In subsequent years: (a) Perumka will be&#13;
required to prepare by June 30 a report evaluating the implementation of the system; and (b) the&#13;
level of track access charges imposed will be increased progressively, having regard, among other&#13;
factors, to the level of road user charges and the experience gained during previous years. These&#13;
arrangements were confirmed at negotiations.&#13;
3.67  Corporate Restructuring of Perumka/Interfaces with GOI.  GOI will arrange for&#13;
Perumka to be transformed into a more autonomous, streamlined and commercially focused limited&#13;
liability  (Persero) company  structured along "line-of-business" principles.   The top-level&#13;
organization of the new company (PT KA) will be designed with a view to its subsequently&#13;
becoming a holding company, some of whose subsidiaries would become candidates for early&#13;
privatization.&#13;
3.68  The 'interfaces" between GOI and the new company will be made simple and clear. The new&#13;
budgeting mechanisms described in the proceeding subsections, coupled with the associated changes&#13;
in the financing of Perumka's investments and the introduction of track access charges represent&#13;
important initial steps in this direction. In addition, GOI has already moved to separate the budget&#13;
funds provided to Perumka under the State Budget from the MOC budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
3.69  GOI recognizes that transforming Perumka into PT KA requires careful preparation and&#13;
planning to ensure that it is more than a change of name. This applies especially to areas such as:&#13;
a) the design of a streamlined corporate structure that increases commercial/profit orientation&#13;
throughout the enterprise, eliminates unnecessary management layers. simplities lines of&#13;
reporting, increases management accountability, and facilitates the subsequeLIt conversion of&#13;
business units into subsidiary companies capable of attracting private investimenit;4&#13;
b) the restructuring of the balance sheet, together with the revaluation of needed assets&#13;
(including land) and the write-off and disposal of obsolete and redundant assets,&#13;
c) the restructuring of the work-force and the improveinent of huinan resource managemenit.&#13;
development and compensation policies along lines that would enable PT KA to operate&#13;
from the outset with a correctly-sized and motivated work-force;&#13;
d) the development of improved and better integrated management, planning and budgetinig&#13;
systems and processes that are aligned to the new corporate structure and mission, that&#13;
enable effective decision-making and control at all levels, and that provide a basis for&#13;
"'performance contracts" between GOI and the corporation; and&#13;
e) the amendment of outdated operating regulations and working procedures that impede&#13;
efficiency and prevent full realization of the benefits of investments in modern tcchinology.&#13;
It is estimated that 18 months will be required to advance these and other necessary activities to a&#13;
stage where conversion to Persero status would be feasible and appropriate.&#13;
3.70  GOI has adopted January 1, 1998 as the target date for PT KA to commence operation, and&#13;
has given the IACC, assisted by the RTF, responsibility for managing the necessary preparations.&#13;
The RTF will be chaired by the Principal Director of Perumka and will report to the IACC. Its&#13;
duties will encompass developing proposals for restructuring the GOI - PT KA interlfce and, in&#13;
consultation with the Jakarta Urban Mass Transit Project Team, preparing detailed proposals for the&#13;
financial and managerial separation of the Jabotabek and Java inter-city systems. A/ negolialions&#13;
agreement was reached that GOI will: (i) furnish the above proposals to the Bank for its review;&#13;
(ii) by February 28, 1997 implement the financial separation of the Jabotabek and .Iava inter-ulrban&#13;
rail systems; (iii) develop and furnish to the Bank/for its review b y October 31, 199'7 i p)rogram for&#13;
the restructuring of Perumka into a limited liability company and a detailed proposval fbr the7&#13;
managerial separation of the Jabotabek and Java inter-urban rail systems; an  (i v) taking into&#13;
account the Bank's comments, establish PT KA and implement the proposal Wit/h C/c cI of.lunuarv 1,&#13;
1998.&#13;
3.71   Private Participation.  GOI considers expanded private participation essenitial for the&#13;
successful development of the railway subsector. Consideration is already being given to a wide&#13;
range of options, ranging from out-sourcing of services, through concessioning of existing railway&#13;
operations and investments in new railway businesses, to development of land and property assets&#13;
and partial divestiture of future PT KA subsidiaries. Importance is attached to private participation&#13;
Early attention needs to be given to the separation. both financial and physical, of the Jabotabek commuter&#13;
railway from the Java intercity system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
being secured through transparent procedures that provide for competition where possible and that&#13;
safeguard adequately the interests of all stake-holders.&#13;
3.72  The RTF has been instructed: (a) by September 1997, to identify and evaluate commercial&#13;
opportunities for railway development in Java and Sumatra and for exploiting Perumka's urban land&#13;
assets; and (b) by October 31, 1997 to formulate guidelines and procedures for soliciting and&#13;
negotiating private participation through concession and other arrangements. In parallel with the&#13;
above, it has also been charged with evaluating unsolicited private proposals in terms, inter alia, of&#13;
their consistency with the planned future sector structure and of the proposed allocations of risks and&#13;
rewards. Agreement was reached that GOI will furnish the guidelines and procedures to the Bank&#13;
for its review and comment and thereafter, finalize and adopt the guidelines taking into account the&#13;
Bank's comments.&#13;
3.73  Implementation of Law 13/92.  The RTF has been instructed to review the current draft&#13;
Govemment Regulations for implementing Law 13/92 (para 1.19); to furnish the results of the&#13;
review to the Bank by February 28, 1997; and to prepare final drafts that are fully consistent with the&#13;
adopted subsector policies and, more generally, with GOI deregulation policies. Agreement was&#13;
reached that the Bank will be afforded the opportunity to comment on the revised draft; that the final&#13;
draft will be prepared taking into account the Bank's comments; and that all measures will be taken&#13;
for its issuance.&#13;
3.74   Environmental Management and Occupational Health and Safety. GOI has instructed&#13;
Perumka to expand and strengthen its existing Quality Assurance Unit to incorporate an&#13;
environmental management and occupational health and safety capability by June 1996, and to&#13;
ensure that this unit is actively involved in the implementation of the proposed Project.  It has&#13;
further instructed that the status and capabilities of this unit be enhanced as part of Perumka's&#13;
transformation to PT KA.   At negotiations agreement was reached with Perumka on the&#13;
implementation of these decisions.&#13;
3.75   Action Plan Implementation Arrangements. At negotiations agreement was reached with&#13;
GOI that it will (i) maintain the inter-agency Coordinating Committee (IACC) to guide and monitor&#13;
the implementation of the railway sector restructuring and, concurrently, to act ay the Steering&#13;
Committee for the project; and (ii) cause Perumka to maintain the (RTF), reporting to the&#13;
Committee, to manage the preparations for Perumka 's conversion to Persero status.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

CHAPTER 4&#13;
THE PROJECT&#13;
A. OBJECTIVES&#13;
4.1    With the general objective of improving the economic efficiency and service quality of&#13;
Indonesia's railway subsector, to position it to play its proper role within the transport system, the&#13;
project aims specifically at: (a) railway subsector policy reform by restructuring the railway&#13;
corporation, reforming the relationship between it and government and creating the foundations for&#13;
expanded private participation; (b) rationalizing railway subsector capital investments; (c) improving&#13;
railway subsector management and operations; and (d) increasing the physical capacity of an&#13;
important railway corridor.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
4.2   The project consists of five components:&#13;
a) Policy reform involving restructuring of Perumka into a persero and reform of government-&#13;
corporate interfaces;&#13;
b) Improvements to the railway between Jakarta and Bandung (170 km) to expand capacity,&#13;
shorten passenger journey times, and improve safety in this important passenger and freight&#13;
corridor;&#13;
c) Implementation of a modern track maintenance system on Java;&#13;
d) Implementation of a diesel electric locomotive unit exchange maintenance system on Java;&#13;
and&#13;
e) Strengthening of Perumka's management.&#13;
4.3   Policy Reform. With the view of improving the efficiency of the railway subsector, GOI&#13;
has developed a set of policies and an action plan (paras. 3.59, 3.60 and Annexes 3.5 and 3.6) for&#13;
restructuring the railway corporation and for realigning GOI's and Perumka's respective&#13;
responsibilities for subsector development. The action plan provides for: (a) the establishment of a&#13;
mechanism to compensate Perumka for its public service obligations; (b) the establishment of a&#13;
mechanism to compensate Perumka for infrastructure maintenance and operation costs; (c) the&#13;
establishment of a system of track access charges; (d) the transformation of Perumka into a limited&#13;
liability company (Persero) structured on "line of business" principles; and (e) the development of a&#13;
framework and strategy for expanded private participation.&#13;
4.4   The IACC which has been established by the Minister of Communications to guide and&#13;
supervise the implementation of these reforms and to oversee implementation of the other project&#13;
components will require the part-time services of an expert individual advisor to assist it with the&#13;
strategic aspects of the restructuring agenda. A total of 12 person-months input is required to be&#13;
provided over a period of 24 months through six to eight periodic visits. These services are required&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
to start as soon as possible and will be financed under the ongoing Second Tecihical Assistance&#13;
Project for Public and Private Provisioni of hIfrastructur-e (Loan 391 3-IND).&#13;
4.5    Responsibility for preparing proposals for the transformation to Persero status. tor the reform&#13;
of the Government-corporate interfaces and the associated review of the dratt (iRs for Law 1 3/92.&#13;
and for expanding private participation has beenl assigned to the RTF. 'I'This is headedi b y Perulnka's&#13;

Private Participation Working Group, which will require the services of consultanits to conduct&#13;
surveys and studies to identify opportullities and mechianiisins for securing expanded and efficient&#13;
private participation in the future developmenit of the Java and Sulimatra railway systems and in the&#13;
exploitation of Perumka's tirbatn land and property assets (total 55 person-mliolithis).&#13;
4.6    Perumka's Finance Director has been charged with proposing methodologies for the public&#13;
service obligations compensationl and hifrastructure mainitenanice and operation budgets and for the&#13;
track access charges system. together with dral't budgets lor FY 1997/98. Two in-lhouse teams have&#13;
been established to unider-take these tasks. The part-time services of an expert advisor are required&#13;
for five person-months over a period of ten months to assist these teamis. The services are required&#13;
to start as soon as possible. In the three subsequent years. follow-on advisory services of about two&#13;
person-months per year would be required to assist in reviewing the experienice with the&#13;
compensation mechanisms and charges system  and in making f'urthier refiinements. The total&#13;
requirement for consultancy services to the RTF is 151 personi-milonths. Most of these services will&#13;
be required to commence before the project becomes effective and will be tinaniced trom  the&#13;
ongoing Loan 3913-4ND2.&#13;
4.7    Jakarta-Bandung Corridor Development. The project provides improvemenits to the&#13;
railway in this corridor to increase capacity in terms of the number of trains operated, reduce&#13;
passenger journey times, and increase service reliability and safety. Improvemenits would include a&#13;
modern centralized traffic control signal system  between  Bekasi, Cikampek, Bandung, and&#13;
Gedebage (156 km); 27.7 km of new second main track; remodeling of station trackage; and 24 km&#13;
25  The services for corporate planning, the preparation of a stafling plan and the development of an MIS will be&#13;
financed under the proposed proJect.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
of new rail to replace partly-worn rail which would be relaid on lower tonnage and lower speed Java&#13;
main lines for the balance of the rail's useful life. The project also provides consultancy services for&#13;
project management and training of Perumka project management and operating and maintenance&#13;
staff.&#13;
4.8    The Jakarta-Bandung Corridor (170 km) consists of several distinct sections described in&#13;
Box 4-1. The 56 km section between Bekasi and Cikampek is the most important intercity railway&#13;
line in Java, carrying all trains to and from points east of Jakarta, not just those to and from&#13;
Bandung.&#13;
Box 4-1: Description of Jakarta-Bandung Corridor&#13;
Gambir-Manggarai (4 km) Carries Jakarta-Bogor suburban services as well as intercity trains.&#13;
Now double-tracked, electrified, and equipped with modern signals. Manggarai is an important&#13;
junction and may become the future Jakarta terminus for intercity trains.&#13;
Manggarai-Bekasi (20 km) Also part of the JABOTABEK suburban system. Now double-tracked,&#13;
electrified, and equipped with modern signals.&#13;
Bekasi-Cikampek (56 km) Now double-tracked with mechanical signals. Would be equipped with&#13;
modern signals under the project.&#13;
Cikampek-Purwakarta (19 km) Now single-tracked with mechanical signals. Would be double-&#13;
tracked and equipped with modern signals under the project.&#13;
Purwakarta-Padalarang (56 km) Now single-tracked with mechanical signals. Unlike other&#13;
sections which are relatively straight and flat, it contains many sharp curves and traverses hilly&#13;
terrain cut by deep valleys spanned by high bridges. Under the project, three sections of about 3 km&#13;
each would be double-tracked, and the entire section would be equipped with modem signals.&#13;
Padalarang-Bandung (15 km) Now double-tracked with mechanical signals. Would be equipped&#13;
with modem signals under the project.&#13;
4.9    Perumka and its consultants analyzed the options for meeting future expected passenger and&#13;
freight demand in the Jakarta-Bandung Corridor. They found that most of the feasible short term&#13;
measures already have been implemented by Perumka. The proposed project would therefore focus&#13;
on medium term improvements to enable Perumka to handle the forecast growth in passenger and&#13;
freight traffic up to the year 2020. This will require both higher train frequencies and longer trains,&#13;
increased infrastructure capacity, improved punctuality through centralized control of train&#13;
movements, and a reduction in the traveling time of the Gambir-Bandung Parahyangan trains to 2 hr&#13;
22 min with existing locomotive-hauled trains or 2 hr 18 min with new diesel multiple unit rail cars.&#13;
4.10   Proposed improvements were evaluated by Perumka and its consultants by use of computer&#13;
simulation models. This resulted in recommendations for a cost effective plan of station remodeling,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
double tracking, and signaling improvements. The proposed project would implement the following&#13;
recommendations:&#13;
a) Improve track quality by tamping, by upgrading rails by continuous welding and grinding,&#13;
and by renewal or replacement of switches;&#13;
b) Remodel track layouts of selected stations between Bekasi and Bandung;&#13;
c) Install double track Cikampek-Purwakarta (17.5 kim) and at three locations (total 10.2 km)&#13;
between Purwakarta and Padalarang;&#13;
d) Install a modern signal system between Bekasi and Bandung, with electronic interlocking,&#13;
automatic block signals with intermediate blocks, and centralized traffic control (CTC);&#13;
e) Upgrade track and existing signals on the alternate route via Bogor for detour of container&#13;
trains at night, to provide time for project construction and maintenance on the Corridor;&#13;
f) Provide training to the track, signaling, and rolling stock maintenance personnel and others&#13;
affected by the new signaling and other equipment, starting with a pilot project;&#13;
g) Adapt the local maintenance and operating organization to reflect the changes caused by the&#13;
modernization of the Corridor and the increased traffic levels of the future;&#13;
h) Replace and modernize operating rules governing train operations to benefit fully from the&#13;
introduction of the new signaling system and its inherently greater safety,&#13;
i) Conduct an in-depth study of bridge fatigue lives;&#13;
j) Study the anticipated capacity problem on the line between Manggarai and Bekasi, where&#13;
intercity trains now share a double-tracked line with JABOTABEK electrified suburban&#13;
trains; and&#13;
k) Study the long term needs of the Jakarta-Bandung Corridor to identify cost effective ways to&#13;
increase capacity, reduce travel time, and improve punctuality and service quality.&#13;
4. I1 The study by Perumka and its consultants was an integrated corridor approach to investment&#13;
planning that should be applied throughout Indonesia in the future before railway signaling and other&#13;
major projects are undertaken. The recommended approach is similar to the one being applied in&#13;
China and India, where network computer simulation models are helping to evaluate capacity&#13;
expansion proposals within an individual corridor and to compare proposals for corridors across the&#13;
entire railway network. The proposed project provides assistance to continue the application of&#13;
similar network analysis tools in Indonesia.&#13;
4.12   While the study by Perumka and its consultants was underway, a contract financed by the&#13;
Australian Government was signed for installation of modern signals on the Bekasi-Cikampek&#13;
section and the Padalarang-Bandung-Gedebage sections.  Since financing was available, GOI&#13;
decided to proceed with this part of the capacity expansion investment in advance of Bank appraisal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
of the overall Corridor project because of an urgent need to improve safety and control train&#13;
operations on those sections.&#13;
4.13   In addition to the Australian contract which has already been let, the Jakarta-Bandung&#13;
Corridor improvements would be carried out mainly under the following contracts:&#13;
a)  An ICB contract financed by GOI and the Bank for detailed design of new second main track&#13;
and station remodeling; procurement of miscellaneous track materials (other than new rails,&#13;
sleepers and fasteners, and turnouts); and construction of earthworks and track;&#13;
b)  Separate ICB supply contracts financed by the Bank for new rail, sleepers and fasteners, and&#13;
turnouts;&#13;
c)  An ICB contract financed by GOI and the Bank for detailed design and installation of the&#13;
new signal system for the middle part of the Corridor between Cikampek and Padalarang:&#13;
and&#13;
d)  A contract financed by GOI and the Bank with consultants for project management and&#13;
supervision, and for training of Perumka project management staff and operating and&#13;
maintenance staff ("learning by doing").&#13;
4.14   By separately contracting for the supply of long lead time items such as rail, turnouts, and&#13;
sleeper and fastener assemblies, several months' time can be saved and the actual work under the&#13;
track and station design and construction contract can proceed more quickly. The objective is to&#13;
allow completion of all necessary track and station changes between Bekasi and Cikampek in&#13;
advance of the installation of the new signal system under the ongoing Australian-financed contract.&#13;
4.15   Track Upgrading and Maintenance System. This component consists of renewal of 100&#13;
km of main track, partial restoration of 160 equivalent km of track and establishment of a modern&#13;
track maintenance system on Java. The project provides new rail, concrete sleepers, other track&#13;
materials, a rail reclamation yard, facilities and equipment, and project management services and&#13;
training.&#13;
4.16   The two critical elements of the component are (i) consultant services to assist Perumka to&#13;
better plan and carry out improved track maintenance in the field, and (ii) the investment in the rail&#13;
reclamation yard for the preparation of continuous welded (CWR) new and relay rail. From the rail&#13;
reclamation yard, the new CWR would be transported to the field site by specially equipped trains in&#13;
lengths of at least 300 meters. The rail removed from the track then would be relaid or "cascaded"&#13;
to less important lines. This rail cascade system first would involve transport of the rail on the&#13;
specially equipped trains to the rail reclamation yard for processing and welding into relay CWR.&#13;
The relay CWR then would be transported on the rail trains to other locations on Java. In addition to&#13;
the computer-based data base of measurements of track geometry and wear and the more extensive&#13;
planning to exploit this data base, the project would establish new field maintenance procedures&#13;
(including on-site hand welding and small-machine grinding of worn rail) in order to extend the&#13;
useful life of rail, turnouts, and other track components.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
4.17   The most important resulting benefit is the extension of rail life.   There also should be a&#13;
significant reduction of rolling stock maintenance costs due to better track, a reduction in train&#13;
delays due to less track slow orders, and a reduction of train accidents caused by less track-related&#13;
causes. The intent is that the improved maintenance techniques would be progressively extended&#13;
throughout the Perumka network (not just on  Java), starting with the most heavily trafficked&#13;
sections (i.e., there will not be immediate system-wide benefits).  As this happens, annual&#13;
expenditures for replacement rail should decline significantly.&#13;
4.18   Project management and training required to successfully implement this component will be&#13;
provided under a consulting contract which will include five tasks: (1) rail management, including&#13;
installation of new and relay CWR; (2) track rehabilitation and sub-grade stabilization; (3) track&#13;
restoration; (4) standard track maintenance procedures; and (5) welding and grinding training.&#13;
4.19   Locomotive Unit Exchange Maintenance System. The component consists of establishing&#13;
an "on-time preventive maintenance system with unit exchange" for diesel electric locomotives on&#13;
Java. The system would encompass both the locomotive workshop at Yogyakarta and the two&#13;
locomotive "running maintenance" depots at Semarang and Bandung (Annex 4.1). The project&#13;
provides initial quantities of critical spare parts and components and consultant services and training.&#13;
For the unit exchange maintenance system to be successful and minimize locomotive maintenance&#13;
downtime, the two locomotive depots would be managed and operated literally as extensions of the&#13;
locomotive workshop, where the workshop would manage the various pools of unit exchange&#13;
components to assure their necessary supply and quality to the depots as well as to the workshop&#13;
itself.&#13;
4.20   Project management and training required to successfully implement this component will be&#13;
provided under a consulting contract which will include three tasks: (I) workshop and depot&#13;
supervision and implementation support; (2) preparation of a rolling stock maintenance master plan;&#13;
and (3) Yogyakarta Workshop Quality Assurance Program.&#13;
4.21   Because of budget constraints on the procurement of spare parts, it can be difficult for&#13;
railways to implement a unit exchange maintenance system. The tendency has been for railways to&#13;
first consume components and spares which were procured as capital assets for the unit exchange&#13;
pools, and then to fail to promptly repair or replace the worn or defective components and return&#13;
26     Rather than in years, rail life is measured in terms of the aggregate tonnage it has carried. Rail has a finite&#13;
life which can depend on many factors, including its chemical and physical properties, the volume of&#13;
traffic and the axle loads passing over it, the quality of maintenance of the roadbed as well as the track,&#13;
whether it is laid on tangent or curves, and (in some cases) the climate. Rail is replaced either because it&#13;
reaches wear limits for safe operation or nears the end of its fatigue life. The repeated application of forces&#13;
by passing trains gradually leads to the formation of microscopic fatigue cracks inside the rail that&#13;
ultimately cause the rail to fail at the end of its fatigue life. On many railways of the world, even where&#13;
axle loads are twice those operated on the Jakarta-Bandung Corridor, high quality rails have been laid and&#13;
rail profile grinding and other modem rail maintenance methods are used. In such cases, rail fatigue rather&#13;
than rail wear often determines when rail must be changed. However, on Java it is rail wear that apparently&#13;
determines when it must be replaced, with the average life of main line rail estimated at only 160 million&#13;
tons, a fraction of what its life could be given its good physical and chemical properties. The key to&#13;
achieving longer rail life is the successful implementation of the track maintenance system under the&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
them to the unit exchange pools in usable condition. To help insure against this risk, agreement was&#13;
reached at negotiations that procurement of the initial stock o(f unit exchange components and&#13;
spares financed by the proposed loan will be divided into three tenders, with Bank approval to float&#13;
the second and third tender to be hased on the tdetermination by the consultant assisting Perumka in&#13;
the implementation of this component that satisrtactorv progresS has been made in establishment of a&#13;
diesel electric locomotive unit exchange system.&#13;
4.22   Institutional Development. This componenit aims at developing the institutional capability&#13;
of the railway in railway operations and in planning to meet future transport demand focusing on&#13;
four areas:&#13;
a)  Development and establishment of a bridge mainltenianice management system, including a&#13;
Geographic Information Systein (GIS) (30 staff' monlths of foreign and 20 staff months of&#13;
local consultants);&#13;
b)  Development and introduction of improved signal and train operating regulations and related&#13;
training programs (30 staff months of foreign and 20 staff months of local consultants);&#13;
c)  Refinement and operationalization for purposes of capital investment planning of network&#13;
simulation models for capacity planning (eight staff moniths of foreign and four staff months&#13;
of local consultants; and&#13;
d)  Development of the railway's capability for assessing the long term demand for railway&#13;
services, including the conduct of multimodal ridership studies, using the Jakarta-Bandung&#13;
Corridor as a case study (30 staff months of foreign and 1 00 staff months of local&#13;
consultants).&#13;
C. LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
4.23   The partial double tracking of the section of line between Cikampek and Padalarang will affect&#13;
256 households whose dwellings have been constructed on posted land owned by GOI.  All those&#13;
affected have signed yearly rental agreements with Perumka under which they agree to move when the&#13;
land is required in exchange for a nominal rental payment. There are no squatters. Perumka has&#13;
prepared a draft resettlement action plan in accordance with World Bank policy on resettlement (OD&#13;
4.30). This draft has been reviewed and is being finalized taking into account the Bank's comments.&#13;
Implementation will be monitored independently with quarterly reports provided to Perumka and the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
4.24   For purposes of safety, implementation of the double tracking will also require the acquisition&#13;
of narrow (+/- 2 meter) strips of land along some short rural sections where the width of the existing&#13;
GOI-owned land is slightly less than the desired right-of-way width. The requirement is for 53 pieces&#13;
of land totaling 1.6 ha. No displacement is involved. This land acquisition will also be handled in&#13;
accordance with Bank guidelines.&#13;
4.25   The costs of Rp 1.8 billion associated with the RAP and land acquisition (including a 10%&#13;
contingency) are included in the project cost estimates. At negotiations, agreement was reached with&#13;
Perumka that (i)for purposes of carrying out the resettlement and rehabilitation of affected persons,&#13;
the resettlement and the land acquisition will be implemented in accordance with the plans agreed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34-&#13;
with the Bank, and (ii) that upon completion of the resettlement and land acquisition it willfurnish&#13;
to the Bank an evaluation report documenting the process and the outcome.&#13;
D. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS&#13;
4.26   The project will not have any major adverse environmental impacts and is classified as&#13;
category "B". The partial double-tracking of the Cikampek-Padalarang section under the Jakarta-&#13;
Bandung Corridor development component is straight-forward and does not involve the construction&#13;
of major structures and or pose risk of damage to environmentally sensitive areas. Appropriate&#13;
mitigation measures designed to safeguard drainage structures and minimize dust, traffic disruption,&#13;
workplace hazards and other impacts of the construction work will be included in the conditions of&#13;
contract.&#13;
4.27   The locomotive maintenance component entails only the limited upgrading of existing&#13;
workshop and depot buildings and equipment. Specific provision is made for preventing workshop&#13;
and depot operations affecting the surrounding environment, in particular through measures designed&#13;
to contain and enable satisfactory disposal of spilled or waste fuel and lubricants. The project will&#13;
also contain measures to eliminate or reduce identified environmental problems. The draft&#13;
environmental management and monitoring plans for the Jakarta-Bandung Corridor component have&#13;
been reviewed by the Bank and are being finalized taking into account the Bank's comments. At&#13;
negotiations, agreement was reached with Perumka that it will: (i) implement the environmental&#13;
action and monitoring plans; and (ii) incorporate appropriate environmental mitigation measures in&#13;
the conditions of contract for the Jakarta-Bandung track works contract.&#13;
E. COST ESTIMATES&#13;
4.28   Cost estimates are based on feasibility studies and preliminary designs that have been carried&#13;
out by Perumka's consultants and modified where appropriate by Perumka and the Bank. Cost&#13;
estimates include project management and supervision and assume that detailed design of works in&#13;
the Jakarta-Bandung Corridor would be the responsibility of the contractors responsible for&#13;
construction and installation of trackwork and signaling.&#13;
4.29   The estimated project cost, exclusive of duties and taxes but including a 1 0% physical&#13;
contingency on all components and a price contingency to cover estimated price inflation during the&#13;
planned five year implementation period, is US$207.3 million (Rp. 573 billion).  Estimated direct&#13;
and indirect foreign cost is US$163 million. Price inflation in terms of US dollars was assumed at&#13;
3.3% p.a. for 1996 and 2.4% p.a. thereafter. Price inflation in terms of Indonesian rupiahs was&#13;
assumed at 8.7% p.a. Table 4-1 summarizes cost estimates by major project component in January&#13;
1996 prices based on an exchange rate of Rp. 2,331 per US$. Details are provided in Annex 4.3.&#13;
4.30   The Government of Australia already has financed a contract for A$78.5 million (US$56&#13;
million), which was executed in July 1995, for a portion of the signal system for the Jakarta-&#13;
27     Value added taxes (VAT) on the portion of contracts financed from domestic sources (GOI/Perumka) is to&#13;
be paid and provision for such payments must be included in the relevant budgets. Likewise, income tax&#13;
on the GOI/Perumka financed portion of contracts for services and for goods/works is payable and should&#13;
be budgeted for.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35-&#13;
Bandung Corridor. The cost of this contract has been included in the project cost since the signal&#13;
system is integral to the Jakarta-Bandung Corridor component of the project and its implementation&#13;
will be the responsibility of the project management and supervision organization.&#13;

F. FINANCING PLAN&#13;
4.31   The policy reform component as well as the study of long term demand in the Jakarta-&#13;
Bandung corridor would be financed by GOI under the ongoing Technical Assistance Project for&#13;
Public and Private Provision of Infrastructure (Ln. 3385-IND) and the Second Project (Ln. 3913-&#13;
IND) and in part with funds under the proposed project. GOI, who is the owner of the railways'&#13;
infrastructure (track and signaling), would finance the improvements to the Jakarta-Bandung&#13;
Corridor and the track upgrading and maintenance system component (including the consultant's&#13;
services for project management and training related to the latter) by using funds from an existing&#13;
Australian loan, the proposed IBRD loan, and the APBN Rupiah budget. Perumka would finance the&#13;
locomotive unit exchange maintenance system, the consultant's services for project management and&#13;
training related to the Jakarta-Bandung corridor component and the remaining three items under the&#13;
institutional development component using funds from the onlent portion of the proposed IBRD&#13;
loan, internal sources, and domestic borrowings. Agreement was reached with GOI during&#13;
negotiations that GOI will onlend Perumka 's share of the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan to it&#13;
under the same terms as the Bank loan to GOI plus 0.5 percent. As a condition of effectiveness, a&#13;
subsidiary loan agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, shall have been signed between GOI and&#13;
Perumka.&#13;
4.32   The financing plan is summarized in Table 4-2 and detailed in Annex 4-4. The proposed&#13;
Bank loan to the Republic of Indonesia, ongoing Loans 3385-IND and 3913-IND, and the Loan from&#13;
the Government of Australia would finance direct and indirect foreign cost of investments and&#13;
technical assistance totaling US$161 million. GOI and Perumka would finance local costs totaling&#13;
US$44 million. The Bank loan would be US$105 million and financing from Loans 3385-IND and&#13;
3913-IND would be US$2.4 million.&#13;

4.33   General. Procurement arrangements for the proposed project are summarized in Table 4-3&#13;
above. Goods and works shall be procured in accordance with the provisions of the "Bank's&#13;
Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" of January 1995 and revised in&#13;
January 1996. Civil works contracts estimated at US$3 million equivalent or above would be&#13;
procured following International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures (this would involve one or&#13;
two contracts). Previous experience in Indonesia indicates that foreign contractors would not bid for&#13;
contracts estimated to cost less than this amount. Civil works estimated to cost less than US$3&#13;
million per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$3 million may be procured under&#13;
NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. This involves environmental upgrading of and repairs to&#13;
buildings and facilities at seven sites and the reconstruction of one bridge. These works would be&#13;
packaged in two to three contracts. Goods will be procured under ICB, except for goods which must&#13;
be purchased from the original supplier to be compatible with existing equipment or of a proprietary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
nature, up to $100,000 equivalent, which, with the Bank's prior agreement may be procured under&#13;
direct contracting. Forthe procurement of good and works under ICB, the Bank's standard bidding&#13;
documents will be used. Qualifying local manufacturers competing for the supply of goods under&#13;
ICB procedures would be eligible for a preference in bid evaluation of 15% of the CIF price or the&#13;
import duty, whichever is lower.&#13;
4.34   Perumka has been involved in a number of major procurements, including works and&#13;
equipment procurement for the JABOTABEK urban railway system and the South Sumatra railway.&#13;
Procedures followed were those of GOI and/or foreign lenders. Staffing for major procurements is&#13;
on a project basis. Procurement under the Bank's Railway T1echnical Assistance Project was&#13;
satisfactory. The Project Management Unit which will be responsible for procurement under the&#13;
project will be strengthened with consultants experienced in project management.&#13;
4.35   Review. All works bid packages (a total of three to five) will be reviewed by the Bank. Bid&#13;
packages for goods to be financed by the Bank loan estimated to cost over US$200,000 equivalent&#13;
(over 90% of the procurement volume) would be subject to the Bank's prior review. All consulting&#13;
services estimated at or above US$100,000 equivalent to be provided by firms, and at or&#13;
aboveUS$50,000 equivalent to be provided by individuals, also would be subject to the Bank's prior&#13;
review (over 90% of the procurement volume). Contracts for consultants' services estimated to cost&#13;
less than US$100,000 equivalent for firms, or less than US$50,000 for individuals will not be subject&#13;
to prior review. However, the following will be subject to prior review by the Bank: (a) terms of&#13;
reference for such contracts; (b) single-source selection of firms; (c) assignments of a critical nature&#13;
as determined by the Bank; (d) amendments to contracts with firms raising the contract value to&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent or above; and (e) amendments to contracts for individuals raising the&#13;
contract value to US$50,000 equivalent or above. Contracts awarded below the prior review&#13;
threshold or on the basis of SOEs would be few and would be subject to random ex-post review by&#13;
the Bank's Project Implementation Unit in Indonesia using established sampling procedures.&#13;
4.36   Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for the&#13;
Use of Consultants", using the Bank's Standard Form of Contract for Consultants' Services. The&#13;
list of consultancy services is shown in Annex 4.2 and includes: (i) policy reform; (ii)&#13;
implementation support and training; and (iii) institutional development.&#13;
H. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
4.37   The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against approved contracts as follows: (a) 30%&#13;
of expenditures for the Jakarta-Bandung Corridor track construction works, including improvement&#13;
of level crossings, and for replacement of Bridge 433 on the alternative route via Bogor; (b) 60% of&#13;
expenditures for the civil works (including pollution abatement equipment) at Yogyakarta, Bandung&#13;
and Semarang for locomotive maintenance facilities; (c) 90% of expenditures for the aggregate&#13;
amount of the Cikampek-Padalarang signal construction contract; (d) 100% of C.I.F. for directly&#13;
imported equipment and materials and 100% of ex-factory expenditures for locally assembled&#13;
imported equipment and materials; and (e) 80% of all contracted consulting services expenditures.&#13;

4.38   Special Account. In order to facilitate disbursements, a Special Account will be established&#13;
in an amount of US$7 million. This amount will be deposited in Bank Indonesia on terms and&#13;
conditions satisfactory to the Bank. This Special Account will be held in the name of the Director&#13;
General of Budget, Ministry of Finance, following established procedures. Replenishment of the&#13;
Special Account will be made on a monthly basis, or when 20 percent of the initial deposit has been&#13;
used, whichever comes first.&#13;
4.39   Withdrawal applications would be fully documented for all expenditures against which loan&#13;
disbursements would be made, except for materials and equipment valued at less than US$200,000,&#13;
and consulting contracts valued at less than US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals&#13;
that would be disbursed on the basis of statements of expenditures (SOE). Documents supporting&#13;
the SOEs would be retained by the respective project implementing agencies and would be made&#13;
available for review as requested by Bank missions. The estimated disbursement schedule for the&#13;
proposed Bank loan is shown in Annex 4.5.&#13;
4.40   The project is expected to be completed by March 31, 2002, and the loan closing date is&#13;
September 30. 2002.&#13;
1. IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
4.41   Overall responsibility for coordinating and guiding the project's implementation will be&#13;
vested in the IACC which has already been established by Ministerial Decree. This Committee will&#13;
be assisted by the RTF on which Perumka is represented at director level. The project's policy&#13;
component will be implemented through this structure. At negotiations, agreement was reached that&#13;
GOI will maintain. (i) the IACC to guide and monitor the implementation of the railway&#13;
restructuring, and concurrently to act as the Steering Committee for the project, and (ii) the RTF to&#13;
manage the preparation of Perumka's conversion to Persero status.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
4.42   Technical management of the Jakarta-Bandung Corridor, track upgrading and maintenance,&#13;
and locomotive maintenance components, together with the Perumka institutional strengthening&#13;
component will be vested in a Project Management Unit to be established within Perumka (PMUP).&#13;
Project implementation is scheduled to require five years.&#13;
4.43   Reporting to the Project Management Unit Perumka (PMUP) would be three Project&#13;
Implementation Units (PIUs) staffed full-time by Perumka personnel:&#13;
a)   PIU for Jakarta-Bandung Corridor improvements and track maintenance system, including&#13;
related training. Both the Jakarta-Bandung Corridor improvements and the track maintenance&#13;
system would be the responsibility of one PIU in order to plan and coordinate track&#13;
construction and rail installation in the Corridor and elsewhere on Java;&#13;
b)   PIU for Locomotive Unit Exchange Maintenance System, including related training; and&#13;
c)   PIU for Perumka institutional development.&#13;
4.44   Consultants financed by GOI and the Bank would assist the PMUP and the PIUs in&#13;
implementing the project, and their appointment would be a condition of Bank approval of the&#13;
associated construction and equipment procurement contracts. At negotiations agreement was&#13;
reached that Perumka will maintain the Project Management Unit and the three Project&#13;
Implementation Units with staffing satisfactory to the Bank. Because of the complexity of the&#13;
interfaces between the various activities and the need for careful scheduling, the consultants should&#13;
be assisting the PIUs right from the start. Thus, for the Jakarta-Bandung Corridor Development and&#13;
the Track Upgrading and Maintenance System components, Bank approval of the contracts for track&#13;
works, supply and installation of signaling, and supply of new rail will be contingent upon the&#13;
consultants assisting Perumka in the implementation of these components having been appointed.&#13;
4.45   Perumka has prepared a Project Implementation Plan (PIP) which was reviewed by the Bank.&#13;
This document is part of the project file. The PIP contains the following principal elements for each&#13;
component of the project: project description, organizational arrangements, project management&#13;
structure, time bound implementation plan including procurement schedule, milestones and&#13;
performance indicators, and TORs for the technical assistance components.  The project&#13;
management and implementation schedule is presented in Annex 4.6.&#13;
J. PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, MONITORING AND SUPERVISION&#13;
4.46   Monitoring of achievement of the project objectives will cover six main areas: (a) Policy&#13;
Reform Implementation; (b) Progress in Rationalization of Capital Investments; (c) Operational&#13;
Performance; (d) Financial Performance; (e) Capacity in the Jakarta Bandung Corridor; and (f)&#13;
Quality of Service (Annex 4.7). Achievements in the area of policy reform will be tracked by the&#13;
dates of key actions of the action plan. The rationalization of capital investments will be monitored&#13;
in terms of the percent of investments in the updated core plan which has been developed using&#13;
economic/financial analyses. Operational and financial performance will be monitored using some&#13;
key performance indicators routinely produced by Perumka for which targets will be agreed with&#13;
Perumka each year for the two following years. The result of the development of the Jakarta&#13;
Bandung Corridor will be monitored in terms of the theoretical capacity and actual capacity&#13;
utilization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
4.47   Project component implementation performance will be monitored primarily against the&#13;
implementation plan and schedule (Annex 4.6).&#13;
4.48  At negotiations agreement was reached with GOI and Perumka that. (i) achievement of the&#13;
project's objectives will be monitored in accordance with performance indicators and targets&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank; (ii) by September 30 of each year a report will be prepared on the&#13;
achievement of the project objectives and performance targets, including any measures to achieve&#13;
the objectives, and if necessary in the light of progress achieved and other developments, proposals&#13;
for revisions to the targets for the subsequent two years; and (iii) the report will be reviewed with&#13;
the Bank, and thereafter all measures necessary will be taken for the completion of the project&#13;
components and their objectives and the achievement of the performance targets taking into account&#13;
of the Bank's comments. For project component implementation, Perumka would submit to the Bank&#13;
quarterly progress reports showing the progress of procurement and construction and the execution&#13;
of the technical assistance against the time bound implementation schedules. These progress reports&#13;
would be sent to the Bank within 10 days after the close of each quarter. Within six months of&#13;
completion of the project, Perumka will furnish to the Bank a completion report on the&#13;
implementation of the project.&#13;
4.49   The project supervision arrangements are described in Annex 4.8. During the first three&#13;
years, two supervision missions are scheduled each year. Subsequently, one supervision mission is&#13;
scheduled every nine months. Supervision will focus on: (a) progress with Perumka restructuring;&#13;
(b) Perumka's financial and operational performance; (c) the railway infrastructure and Perumka's&#13;
investment plans; (d) implementation issues affecting the investment components; and (e) technical&#13;
assistance and training issues. Supervision will require expertise in institutional development,&#13;
organizational restructuring, marketing and other commercial issues, project management, railway&#13;
infrastructure and rolling stock maintenance and rehabilitation, and financial analysis. Staff input is&#13;
budgeted for 95 staff-weeks for the five-year implementation period.&#13;
K. AUDITING&#13;
4.50   The PMUP will be responsible for collecting and consolidating the project accounts and&#13;
financial reports, including for disbursements under SOE procedure, in respect of the project&#13;
components. At negotiations agreement was reached with GOI and Perumka that the project&#13;
accounts, including documentation for payments on the basis of SOEs, will be audited every year by&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; and that the consolidated audit reports would be&#13;
submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year.&#13;
4.51   At negotiations agreement was reached with Perumka that it shall maintain records and&#13;
accounts adequate to reflect in accordance with sound accounting practices its operations and&#13;
financial condition, and that it shall have its records, accounts and financial statements for each&#13;
financial year audited, in accordance with appropriate auditing principles, by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Bank; andfurnish the audited accounts to the Bank within six months of/the end of&#13;
the financial year, except for FYs 96 and 9 7 as noted in para. 3.25 above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CHAPTER 5&#13;
ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
A. BENEFITS, BENEFICIARIES AND FISCAL IMPACT&#13;
5.1   The policy reform and investmenits under the project will bring about a wide range of&#13;
benefits.  First, the improved interface between GOI and Perumnka, through establishment of&#13;
mechanisms for compenisationi of PSO and track maintenanice and of the track access charges&#13;
system. will make Perumka financially more independent, create incentives for GOI and Perumka&#13;
to achieve an efficient balance between track investments and mainiteniance,  and provide a&#13;
framework for introducing private participation and competition in track maintenance and train&#13;
operations.  Second. the development of a business-oriented organizational structure, a more&#13;
rationalized investment and naintenance planniing and budgeting process, improved workforce&#13;
management, and modernized operating procedures, will eniable Perumka to better understand the&#13;
needs of its customers and focus on providing those services that are competitive with other modes.&#13;
It will also improve allocation of scarce resources, increase labor and capital productivity, and&#13;
improve railway services in terms of availability, reliability, safety and affordability. Third, the&#13;
improvements in the Jakarta-Bandung corridor will increase throughput capacity, improve control&#13;
and safety of train operations and service reliability, and better satisfy demand for travel by rail&#13;
and relieve traffic on roads. The results will be lower vehicle and road capital and maintenance&#13;
costs, less air pollution and environmenital damage, and less highway and urban congestion.&#13;
Fourth. the improved track mainitenanice procedures, including greater use of CWR, will extend&#13;
rail life, generate savings in track mainiteniance costs, improve safety of trainl operations and reduce&#13;
train operating costs.  Fifth, the locomiotive unit exchange maintenance system  will reduce&#13;
locomotive mainitenance down timle and allow the existing locomotive fleet to be available for&#13;
service a greater portion of time, tlLus generating savin gs in locomotive investment and&#13;
maintenance costs.&#13;
5.2    The benefits from the expected efficiency improvements in capital spending, maintenance&#13;
and operation will accrue to railway passengers and freight shippers. The Indonesian government&#13;
and taxpayers in general will also benefit following the plhasing out of subsidies. In terms of fiscal&#13;
impact the annual flow of funds between GOI and Perumka is expected to turn from a net negative&#13;
flow to a net positive flow in favor of GOI (Table 6-2). In addition, the expected railway service&#13;
imiprovemiienits and cost reductions will induce an environmiiientally  more sustainable modal&#13;
distribution between rail and road. Better railway services and lower costs will benefit users of all&#13;
transport modes and the economy at large. A cleaner enivironlment and fewer accidents will also&#13;
benefit most members of the society.&#13;
5.3    An economic analysis has been carried out of the tlhree investmiienit componienits: Jakarta -&#13;
Bandung corridor improvements, track maintenance system, and locomotive unit exchange&#13;
maintenance system, whiclh together represent over 967 of total project costs. The estimated net&#13;
present values (NPV) and economic internal rate of returnis (ERR) for each component are&#13;
summarized in Table 5- 1. The results show  that the proposed investmiienits are economically&#13;
justified. The investmenits yield a total NPV of Rp.348 billion, or US$155 million. The overall&#13;
ERR is estimated at 20.9%.&#13;

B. JAKARTA - BANDUNG CORRIDOR IMPROVEMENTS&#13;
5.4   The Jakarta-Bandung Corridor connects two urban agglomerations totaling some 20 million&#13;
people and is one of the most important intercity passenger transport markets in Java. The corridor&#13;
is served by rail, road and air. The rail passenger services transport over 3.5 million people per&#13;
year (2.5 million by executive and business classes and I million by economy class), capturing&#13;
about 17% of the total passenger traffic between Jakarta and Bandung.  Some 50% of the&#13;
passengers travel by car, 33 % by bus, and less than I % by air.&#13;
5.5   Executive and business rail traffic has enjoyed a strong growth, averaging 12. 1 % and 8.4%&#13;
respectively per year from 1987 to 1995. This has been led by the rapid urbanization and steadily&#13;
growing economy and personal income. It is also due to the higher quality of the rail passenger&#13;
services relative to the available car or bus transport. It takes about two hours and 45 minutes to&#13;
travel between Jakarta and Bandung by rail, but some three to four hours by car and nearly five&#13;
hours by bus. Rail travel is also more comfortable and much safer than road travel. Road traffic&#13;
accidents are a serious problem in Indonesia. Average fatality rates are about ten times higher than&#13;
in most industrialized countries. The Jakarta-Cikampek toll road, which is the first section of the&#13;
road link between Jakarta and Bandung, has a particularly high traffic accident rate. On the&#13;
mountainous section between Purwakarta and Bandung, the road is narrow, twisting and on fairly&#13;
steep gradients. Trucks hold up traffic going up hill and poorly tuned engines cause pollution.&#13;
Buses travel at high speeds downhill. Construction of the new toll road between Cikampek and&#13;
Padalarang, which is scheduled to start in 1996 and to be opened to traffic in 2000, is expected to&#13;
improve the road traffic condition and reduce travel time to between two and half to three hours.&#13;
5.6   Freight transport between Jakarta and Bandung is served by rail and road. Containers&#13;
carrying general cargo - mostly manufactured consumer goods such as textiles, tea and garments&#13;
for export - from Gedebage to Tanjung Priok are the most important traffic by rail in the Jakarta-&#13;
Bandung Corridor. The expansion of consumer goods export has led to an impressive growth in&#13;
container transport between Bandung and Jakarta. From a modest start of 2,600 containers (in&#13;
Twenty Foot Equivalent Units TEUs) in 1987, the traffic reached some 60,000 TEUs in 1993.&#13;
Due to a variety of factors such as strong road competition, rail capacity constraints, and&#13;
cumbersome terminal processing at Gedebage dry port, rail container traffic has been steady on&#13;
60,000 TEUs per year from 1993 to 1995.&#13;
5.7    Alternatives. During the past several years a number of alternative investments designed to&#13;
cope with growing traffic in the Jakarta-Bandung corridor have been under consideration. This&#13;
includes proposals analyzed in 1988 (under French financing), in 1993 (under Japanese financing)&#13;
and most recently in 1995 (under Dutch and World Bank financing). The investments proposed&#13;
under the project are a sca!ed down version of these earlier more ambitious proposals. They are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
minimum "no regrets" investment which were formulated on the basis of simulations of alternative&#13;
investment scenarios aimed at meeting traffic demand up to the year 2020 in thie corridor in the&#13;
most cost effective manner (para 4.10-4.11).  Funds are included under the project to replicate&#13;
such corridor investment optimization studies for capacity planning on a wider scale and to assess&#13;
investment requirements in the Jakarta-Bandung Corridor beyond the year 2020.&#13;
5.8    For the economic evaluation of proposed investments, the base case scenario represents the&#13;
situation where a minimum level of track maintenance investment is made which is necessary to&#13;
sustain the current level of rail services. The project case scenario represents the situation where&#13;
the proposed investments are fully implemented by 2001. For purposes of defining the investment&#13;
costs of the project case it is to be noted that the double track railway line between Jakarta and&#13;
Cikampek (Box 4. 1) serves not only traffic to and from Bandung, but also carries all trains to and&#13;
from points east of Jakarta, such as traffic to and from Surabaya, Solo, Yogyakarta, Cirebon and&#13;
Semarang. Thus, the investments in the Jakarta-Cikamapek section of the corridor will benefit all&#13;
train operations east of Jakarta and not only those to Bandung. Accordingly, the economic and&#13;
financial evaluation considers only the traffic flows to/from Jakarta with Bandung as their&#13;
origin/destination on the one hand, and all investments on the line between Cikampek and Bandung&#13;
and a proportion of the investments on the Jakarta-Cikampek line on the other.&#13;
5.9    On the basis of the historical trend and the expected growth in urbanization, economic&#13;
activities and personal income, and taking into account the effects of competition from road and&#13;
tariff increases, it is projected that total executive and business passenger traffic would reach some&#13;
11 million by 2017, when the track's capacity, which is expanded by the proposed investment,&#13;
shall be reached. From the start of project implementation in 1997 to the end of the 20-year&#13;
evaluation period, 2021, the passenger traffic is expected to grow at an average rate of 6% per&#13;
year. For container transport, no growth is assumed during the project implementation period.&#13;
Upon completion of the project, traffic is projected to grow slowly, averaging less than 3% per&#13;
year over the evaluation period, and approach 120,000 TEUs by 2021.&#13;
5.10   The economic analysis compares total costs between the base case and the project case.&#13;
The costs considered include rail and road capital and maintenance costs, rail rolling stock and&#13;
vehicle ownership and operating costs. Investment costs under the project case include a 10%&#13;
physical contingency. Because the Jakarta-Bandung traffic flow accounts for some 35 % of the total&#13;
traffic between Bekasi-Cikampek (Box 4.1) 40% of the investments within the Bekasi-Cikampek&#13;
section (mainly the Australian financed signaling works28) are apportioned to the costs of the&#13;
project case. The ERR of the investment is 12.3%. When estimates of savings in transit time&#13;
costs (using a value of time of Rp. 1,400 per hour), and air pollution and accident costs are taken&#13;
into account the ERR is 14.9%.&#13;
5.11   A  financial analysis has also been carried  out to examine whether the proposed&#13;
improvements are financially sound. The analysis compares net rail revenues between the base&#13;
case and the project case. The financial IRR is estimated at 11.7%.&#13;
28 Even though this investment in signaling had been firmed up independently of the projeci - the contract had&#13;
been signed before the evaluations for the capacity improvements under the project had been completed - it is&#13;
treated as integral part of the corridor development investments because: (i) it is aimed at addressing&#13;
existing capacity constraints in the Jakarta-Bandung corridor; and (ii) its implementation needs to be very&#13;
closely coordinated with the Bank financed investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. TRACK MAINTENANCE SYSTEM&#13;
5.12   Rail has a finite life which depends among other factors, on the quality of its maintenance,&#13;
and the quality of roadbed and track maintenance. Under the project Perumka would implement,&#13;
with the assistance of consultants, an improved track maintenance system on Java. Key elements&#13;
include: (i) the use of continuous welded rail (CWR) for both new and relay rail, whereby part&#13;
worn rail will be reprocessed in a new rail reclamation yard and then be relaid in secondary main&#13;
track and yards; and (ii) new field maintenance procedures, including on-site hand welding and&#13;
small-machine grinding of worn rail, will be introduced to extend the life of rail, turnouts, and&#13;
other track components.&#13;
5.13   Alternatives. During project preparation alternative maintenance equipment options were&#13;
considered and those that were not found cost effective or incompatible with Perumka's absorptive&#13;
capacity were not retained (e.g. acquisition of a rail grinding train). The improved procedures to&#13;
be introduced under this component were developed based on a review of rail life achieved under&#13;
current procedures and practices on the one hand and good international best practice in track&#13;
maintenance and Perumka's institutional capacity on the other.&#13;
5. 14  With the improved maintenance system in place and operational, it is expected that the rail&#13;
life will be extended by a factor of three. This means significant savings in annual track capital&#13;
costs, amounting to some two thirds (60%) of current levels. Additional benefits include the&#13;
reduction of rolling stock maintenance costs, fewer slow running orders and rail failures, and&#13;
lower associated delay and accident costs.&#13;
5.15  The economic analysis compares the net investments and track capital and maintenance cost&#13;
between the base case and the project case. The expected savings in rolling stock maintenance and&#13;
operating costs are not included. Since the new rail and track materials would be provided in the&#13;
base case as well as in the project case, the net investment costs between the two cases consist&#13;
mostly of costs of the rail reclamation yard, rail train, and consultant services. The savings in&#13;
track capital costs are assumed to materialize over a period of seven years, as the improved&#13;
maintenance system  spreads gradually over the whole Java network.  The rail and track&#13;
maintenance costs under the improved maintenance system are assumed to increase over the project&#13;
period to twice the current level. The NPV of the this project component is estimated at Rp.228&#13;
billion and the ERR at 34.8%.&#13;
D. LOCOMOTIVE UNIT EXCHANGE MAINTENANCE SYSTEM&#13;
5.16   A diesel locomotive consists of a frame and some twenty five major components, such as&#13;
diesel engine, generator, compressor, traction motors, etc. Currently, these components are not&#13;
overhauled at their individual most cost effective intervals but when the locomotives get their&#13;
overhauls (a semi-overhaul every two years and a general overhaul every four years). As a result,&#13;
some components are overhauled too early, wasting service time and spare parts, while others are&#13;
overhauled too late, leading to early and more frequent failures or a costly repair or replacement.&#13;
The on-time preventive maintenance system under this project is designed to address this problem&#13;
by overhauling a locomotive component when the component is due, rather than when the&#13;
locomotive is due for an overhaul.&#13;
5.17   Overhauling a component takes a long time during which the locomotive does not provide&#13;
any services. In order to eliminate the locomotive down time when a component is taken off the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
locomotive for an overhaul, this project component also introduces a unit exchange system, which&#13;
will provide a ready-for-use pool of spare components that can be immediately installed to replace&#13;
the overhauled component. The practice of combining on-time maintenance system with a unit&#13;
exchange system has been practiced successfully in many countries including India and Malaysia.&#13;
5.18   Alternatives. During project preparation, alternative investment scenarios for rolling stock&#13;
maintenance were examined and sub-components that were found not viable (e.g. upgrading of the&#13;
wagon and coach workshops) were not retained. The component has been designed following a&#13;
review of Perumka's locomotive maintenance procedures and practices on the one hand and good&#13;
international practice, lessons of experience and Perumka's institutional capacity on the other. The&#13;
implementation arrangements include measures to safeguard against the most common risks of&#13;
failure to implement a unit exchange maintenance system.&#13;
5.19  On time maintenance, rather than maintenance at the time of component failure, is expected&#13;
to lead to fewer locomotive failures. From the present 60 failures per million kilometers - the&#13;
without project case, the failure rate is expected to decrease to around 10 failures per million&#13;
kilometers (i.e., 1/6 the current level) - the with project case. On average about 140 failures a&#13;
year in locomotives result in locomotives being sent to the workshop for major repair work and a&#13;
locomotive remains in the workshop for an average of 30 days. Therefore, about 4,200 locomotive&#13;
days annually are lost due to failures. With the program carried out and the failure rate lowered to&#13;
one sixth the current level, some 3,500 locomotive days are put to operational use, which is&#13;
equivalent to adding about 10 locomotives to Perumka's fleet.&#13;
5.20   Using readily available exchange components from the exchange unit pool, the program is&#13;
also expected to shorten locomotive downtime, resulting in higher locomotive availability.&#13;
Locomotive availability is expected to increase from the present 70%, the without project case, to&#13;
about 80%. Given the existing fleet of 142 diesel electric locomotives on Java, this 10% increase&#13;
means an additional 14 locomotives available for train service.&#13;
5.21   As the quality of maintenance improves, the need for daily checks will diminish. Almost&#13;
immediately, current daily checks, the without project case, will be replaced by checks every other&#13;
day. Total elimination of daily checks by checks every other day is expected to come within a year&#13;
and monthly inspections could come to replace checks every other day within two years (the with&#13;
program case). This would save some 37,000 locomotive hours per year, or an equivalent of four&#13;
additional locomotives.&#13;
5.22  In total, the program can add an equivalent of 28 locomotives to the current fleet of 142 on&#13;
Java. The economic analysis assumes that the full extent of the locomotive savings would be&#13;
gradually realized over a period of six years. The analysis shows that the program will yield a&#13;
NPV of Rp.39 billion and an ERR of 26.3%.&#13;
E. RISKS AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS&#13;
5.23   With regard to the policy component, a main risk is resistance to needed rail subsector&#13;
reforms from some quarters within GOI. While senior officials at MOC, BAPPENAS and&#13;
Ekuwasbang have strongly endorsed the project, resistance by reform averse groups within&#13;
government and outside is possible. This risk is recognized by those in GOI who are strongly&#13;
committed to continuation of the reform process. BAPPENAS can be expected to take a lead role&#13;
in securing timely implementation of the policies. To manage this risk, at negotiations agreement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
would be reached on specific and monitorable actions of the reform agenda and annual review of&#13;
progress.&#13;
5.24   Regarding rationalization of investments, a risk is that influences from outside the railway&#13;
would stand in the way of sound capital investnents and prudent management of the assets of the&#13;
railway. There may be pressure to purchase rolling stock from favored foreign or domestic&#13;
suppliers or there may be directed decisions regarding asset disposal. This risk would be managed&#13;
by fostering a clear and transparent governance structure related to capital investment and financing&#13;
through annual reviews of the investment program and the financial projections.&#13;
5.25   While the three investment components would be insulated from  the above risks their&#13;
implementation entails component specific risks. The main risk relating to the Jakarta-Bandung&#13;
corridor component and track maintenance component is that implementation could suffer delays&#13;
due to the need to work within short "windows" when the line is available. To mitigate this risk,&#13;
one integrated implementation unit would be established for these two components to plan,&#13;
coordinate and monitor track construction and rail installation. The risk relating to the locomotive&#13;
unit exchange maintenance system is that the spare parts procured would be used for consumption&#13;
rather than for unit exchange maintenance pools.  For this component to be successful, the&#13;
locomotive depots must be operated as extensions of the locomotive workshop, and the workshop&#13;
must be reorganized to provide sufficient repaired and new components and parts to replenish the&#13;
unit exchange pools.&#13;
5.26   If the above delays and adverse events would materialize, costs would increase and savings&#13;
would be reduced. Other possible adverse events include lower than predicted traffic and savings&#13;
in transit time and pollution and accident costs. These risks were assessed through a series of&#13;
sensitivity analyses. The results, presented in table 5-2, show that the investments yield robust&#13;
economic returns.  Even under the scenario for the Jakarta-Bandung corridor component where&#13;
both passenger and freight traffic are 20%  below forecast, project cost is overrun by 25%  and&#13;
completion delayed by 2 years, the ERR is still 9.9%.&#13;

CHAPTER 6&#13;
FINANCIAL EVALUATION AND FORECAST&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
6.1    The restructuring of Perumka and the reforms in its relationship with Government to be&#13;
implemented over the next several years will have far reaching consequences for Perumka's&#13;
finances. It is, therefore, necessary to set out the main elements of the framework underlying the&#13;
financial projections and evaluation. First, the financial projections are developed using key inputs&#13;
from Perumka's "core" corporate plan (para. 3.43). Second, they are predicated on the financial&#13;
relationship between the Government and Perumka being reformed as outlined in Chapter 3 with the&#13;
introduction of the PSO and track maintenance compensation mechanisms and the track charges&#13;
system with effect of 1997. Third, they are based on the objective that the corporation should&#13;
become financially self-sufficient and will need to finance its investments from internally generated&#13;
resources and borrowing.&#13;
6.2    While  the "core" corporate plan provides the most realistic starting point possible for&#13;
evaluating Perumka's financial situation and outlook, it needs to be recognized that during this&#13;
period of transition to a fundamentally different corporate and financial environment the "core"&#13;
corporate plan and financial projections will not only need to be updated annually, but may have to&#13;
undergo major modifications in future years owing, inter alia, to: (i) a rationalization in lines of&#13;
business whereby only those unprofitable services which are explicitly required by government and&#13;
for which compensation is provided under the PSO mechanism will be continued; (ii) the impact of&#13;
efficiency improvements; and (iii) private participation schemes being implemented.&#13;
B. PERUMKA'S FINANCIAL FORECAST UNDER THE NEW POLICY FRAMEWORK&#13;
6.3    The Objective of Financial self-sufficiency. This objective is to generate funds sufficient to&#13;
cover operating costs, all financial obligations including debt service charges, and contribute toward&#13;
future investments for renewal and expansion of assets. The review of Perumka's operations and&#13;
past financial performance in Chapter 3 indicated that tariff increases for potentially profitable&#13;
services and discontinuation of unprofitable services will be essential if it is to achieve the objective&#13;
of financial self-sufficiency.&#13;
6.4   The base year for the financial projections is 1996. The main variables are derived from the&#13;
"core" corporate plan which differs from Perumka's approved budget in that the assumptions on&#13;
capacity, traffic growth, tariff increases and investments have been adjusted so as to make them&#13;
internally consistent. The year 1997 will be a transition year as the key elements of the new&#13;
financial relationship between GOI and Perumka will come into effect in that year. These elements&#13;
and the main parameters include:&#13;
a) Introduction of the PSO compensation mechanism with effect of the FY97/98 GOI budget&#13;
year. The unit compensation (per passenger/km and ton/km) is assumed to decline in line&#13;
with productivity improvements and fare/tariff increases;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
b) Introduction of the infrastructure maintenance compensation mechanism with effect of the&#13;
FY97/98 budget year. The compensation is to be based on efficient costs for maintaining the&#13;
infrastructure to defined standards and to comprise outlays for materials, direct labor, general&#13;
staff and an administrative expenses component. For 1997 the payment was estimated to&#13;
amount to Rp 182 billion. This compares to an actual payment of Rp 31.5 billion for 1995;&#13;
and&#13;
c) Introduction of a track access charges system whereby Perumka would pay GOI for the use&#13;
of the track. This charge has been estimated at 2.1 Rp/gtkm.&#13;
6.5    Moreover, other key assumptions used to develop the financial projections include that&#13;
traffic will continue to grow in line with past trends (i.e. initially 8.5% per year for executive and&#13;
business class reducing to 7.5% by 2001, and 5% per year for economy class), that Perumka will&#13;
adjust its tariffs taking into account costs and market conditions and that selective investments will&#13;
be carried out to replace existing rolling stock and/or to meet growing demand. Productivity&#13;
increases were also adopted for fleet utilization and locomotive utilization. Major assumptions and&#13;
notes underlying the financial forecast are described in Annex 6.1. Details of calculations and other&#13;
information are in the Project file.&#13;
6.6    Financial Projections for Perumka.   The Projected  Income Statement, Cash Flow&#13;
Statement and Balance Sheet are shown in Tables 3, 4 and 5 of Annex 6.1. The main results and&#13;
financial performance indicators are summarized below:&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
6.7    The above indicators show encouraging financial development for the corporation. The&#13;
operating ratio improves from 97% in 1996 to 90% in 2002. The return on net fixed assets (revalued&#13;
in 1998) improves from 2% to 5% over the same period. Perumka will be able to accumulate a cash&#13;
surplus of Rp. 233 billion by 2002 (Annex 6.1, Table 4). The Self-Financing Ratio will be 27% in&#13;
1997 and thereafter will gradually rise to 40% in 2002. The Debt Service Coverage Ratio will&#13;
remain within a comfortable range of 2.0 to 3.4 from 1997 to 2002. GOI's net cash outflow to&#13;
Perumka will gradually decrease from a high of Rp. 95 billion in 1998 to Rp. 32 billion in 2000, and&#13;
thereafter, it will begin to experience a net fund in-flow from Perumka (Table 6-2). This indicates&#13;
that the railway operations will become a source of income for GOI.&#13;

6.8    The projected Balance Sheet results (Table 5, Annex 6. 1) indicate that the Current Ratio,&#13;
Acid Test Ratio and the Debt/Equity Ratio would remain at acceptable levels. However, Perumka&#13;
will need to monitor closely its high debt service obligations caused by substantial but much needed&#13;
investments.  The projections indicate that Perumka should be able to achieve financial self-&#13;
sufficiency provided: (i) the financial relationship between GOI and Perumka is reformed in&#13;
accordance with the arrangements for introduction of the PSO and track maintenance compensation&#13;
payments and the track access charges system outlined above: and (ii) productivity improvements&#13;
and fare/tariff increases materialize. More precise evaluations and cost estimates to firm up the PSO&#13;
and track maintenance compensation and the track charges for 1997 are being carried out with the&#13;
assistance of consultants. Accordingly, the actual payments in 1997 and subsequent years could be&#13;
different from those underlying these financial projections. Perumka will, therefore, need to monitor&#13;
closely and update its financial projections and key financial indicators to reflect the outcome of the&#13;
estimates for the compensation and charging mechanisms, in particular for the first year, and take all&#13;
necessary action to maintain its financial self-sufficiency.&#13;
C. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS&#13;
6.9    To assess the risks attached to the above financial projections, sensitivity analyses were&#13;
carried of the key parameters likely to impact on Perumka's financial outlook. These include: the&#13;
compensation payments to Perumka and track access charges paid by Perumka, the timeliness and&#13;
adequacy of tariff adjustments, the realization of productivity and traffic increases, and the level of&#13;
new investment. Sensitivity analyses were carried under the following scenarios: (a) tariff increases&#13;
are only half those of the base case assumptions; (b) the compensation mechanism for PSO and&#13;
infrastructure maintenance and the track access charges system are not implemented; (c) Perumka&#13;
does not achieve any productivity increases; and (d) traffic growth is reduced by 20%, The results&#13;
are shown in Table 6.3.&#13;

6.10   The above results indicate that Perumka's financial viability is highly sensitive to tariff&#13;
adjustments and productivity improvements. If these unfavorable scenarios were to materialize, net&#13;
cash flow would become negative which would make it impossible for Perumka to meet the debt&#13;
service obligations and to contribute to future investments.   While under scenario b) (the&#13;
compensation payments and track access charges are not implemented), Perumka's financial&#13;
situation initially deteriorates, it is comparable to the base case by the year 2002. This is because&#13;
the loss of the maintenance payments is more than compensated by the non-payment of access&#13;
charges.&#13;
6.11   These evaluations also show that Perumka should monitor closely and update annually its&#13;
financial performance indicators (Table 6-1).  Because of the uncertainty of the impacts of&#13;
Perumka's restructuring to a commercially and financially autonomous enterprise on its financial&#13;
performance, key targets should be reviewed annually and revised if deemed necessary in the light of&#13;
experience and remedial actions taken or to be taken when targets are not being met. Given the&#13;
critical importance of appropriate PSO and track maintenance compensation payments and&#13;
appropriate track access charges for: (i) introducing a commercial approach in performing services;&#13;
(ii) distinguishing between market-driven and socially driven services; (iii) providing incentives for&#13;
operational efficiency; (iv) providing incentives for appropriate maintenance; and (v) compensating&#13;
&#13;

GOI for track usage, at negotiations agreement was reached with GOI that it will establish and&#13;
maintain these arrangements in place and refine them in the light of experience (paras 3.60-66).&#13;
6.12   Furthermore, agreement waxi reached with Perumka that it will:&#13;
a)  take all such measures, including but not limited to tariff adjustments, controlling costs,&#13;
improving productivity and developing new services or discontinuing unprofitable services,&#13;
as shall be required to generate each year funds from internal sources sufficient to cover&#13;
operating costs, debt service charges and other financial obligations and to achieve a self&#13;
financing ratio of not less than 20% during 1997 - 2000 and not less than 25% thereafter of&#13;
the annual average capital expenditures incurred, or expected to be incurred, for that year,&#13;
the previous year and nextfollowing year;&#13;
b)  incur additional debt only if the iniernal cash generation would provide a minimum debt&#13;
service coverage ratio of 1.5 times during the forecast period,&#13;
c)  by September 30 of each year review and report on the progress in meeting the above&#13;
requirements and if deemed necessary in the light of its achievements in meeting the targets,&#13;
propose remedial actions and/or new targets for the current year and the next following year&#13;
for the Bank's comments; and&#13;
d)  establish revised targets taking into account the Bank's comments.&#13;
6.13   Perumka's assets are recorded at historical costs. With the view of its transformation into a&#13;
limited liability company as per I January 1998, Perumka plans to carry out a revaluation of its&#13;
assets by December 31, 1997. At negotiations, agreement was reached with Perumka that it will:&#13;
(i) prepare proposals for a revaluation of its assets by September 30, 1997 for review by the Bank;&#13;
(ii) finalize the revaluation of assets taking into account the Bank 's comments; and (iii) record the&#13;
revalued assets in its books as of January 1, 1998.&#13;

RAILWAY EFFICIENCY PROJECT&#13;
PERFORMANCE AND COMPARATIVE STATISTICS&#13;
I1.    Perumka's combined operations on Java and South Sumatra have been compared to the railways&#13;
of Thailand, Sri Lanka, Austria, and Belgium for 1994. Perumnka's lines in West and North Sumatra&#13;
were excluded from the comparisons shown in Figures I through 8 of this aniex and are summarized&#13;
below:&#13;
*  Perumka's physical utilization of assets is good measured against its four comparators. For&#13;
example, its Java and South Sumatra railways have the highest traffic density in terms of&#13;
combined annual passenger arid ton kilometers per kilometer of main track (Figure I ).&#13;
*  However, Perumka's finanlcial return on assets is poor because its US dollar revenues per&#13;
passenger kilometer and per ton kilometer are low.  For example, its annual revenue per&#13;
kilometer of main track is much lower than that of railways in Austria arid Belgium, which are 5&#13;
and 3 times higher, respectively (Figure 2). The low revenue is a significant indicator of&#13;
Perumka's unprofitability since most of the track investment and repair cost consists of material&#13;
that is at least as expensive in Indonesia as it is in Austria and Belgium.&#13;
-  Perumka's utilization in terms of passenger kilometers and ton kilometers per locomotive and&#13;
multiple unit power car is lower than Thailand's but better than the others (Figure 3).&#13;
-  Perumka's annual revenue per locomotive and power car is lower thani Thailanid's, but Austria's&#13;
and Belgium's are 3.1 and 1.5 times higher, respectively (Figure 4). As with track, Perumka's&#13;
low revenue is a significant indicator of unprofitability since most of the investment and repair&#13;
cost of locomotives and multiple unit power cars consists of material that is at least as expensive&#13;
in Indonesia as it is in Austria and Belgium.&#13;
*  Another utilization measure is annual passenger kilometers per coach aiid passenger rail car.&#13;
Perumka's physical utilization is 88%  of Thailand's but better than the others (Figure 5).&#13;
Perumka's financial return from these assets (not shown) is less than for Thailand, Austria, and&#13;
Belgium due to its lower revenue per passenger kilometer.&#13;
*  Perumka's physical wagon utilization in terms of annual ton kilometers per wagon compares&#13;
favorably to the others (Figure 6). But its financial returm is lower than for Thailand, Austria,&#13;
and Belgium due to lower revenue per ton kilometer.&#13;
*  Perumka's combined annual passenger and ton kilometers per employee is lower than that of&#13;
Thailand but significantly better than that of the other three comparators (Figure 7).&#13;
*  The ratio of revenue yield per passenger kilometer to revenue yield per ton kilometer can be a&#13;
relative indicator of cross subsidy, especially where freight rates have beeii raised to offset low&#13;
passenger fares while attempting to achieve profitability overall. This appears to be the case for&#13;
Perumka and Thailand (Figure 8), which indicates a significant cross subsidy.&#13;
2.     The overall conclusion of the analysis is that Perumka ranks relatively higih in terms of physical&#13;
measures of asset utilization. But mainly due to depressed passenger fares, the revenue earnings of its&#13;
physical assets are inadequate and significantly lower than the railways in Thailand, Austria, and&#13;
Belgium.&#13;

GOALS AND P'OLICIES FOR THE DEVELOPl\iENT&#13;
Rcised Concept&#13;
Baclkground&#13;
1.    The broad goals and policies for the future development of Indonesia's transport sector&#13;
and, within this the railway transport subsector, are set out in the Outlines of State Policy (Garis-&#13;
Garis Besar Haluan Negara or GBHN) adopted by the Peoples' Consultative Assembly (MPR) in&#13;
March 1993. This important document, which provides the foundadionis and framework for the&#13;
Second Long-Term  (Twenty-Five Year) Development Plan (PJP-I1) and the Sixth Five-Year&#13;
Development Plan (Repelita VI), highlights the critical importance of forging a reliable, efficient,&#13;
safe, orderly and well integrated national transport system with the capacity and coverage to&#13;
support sustained rapid economic growth and industrialization, to promote the strengthening of&#13;
national unity through the more equitable distribution of national development benefits, and to&#13;
accelerate the development of Indonesia's more remote regions. It also emplhasizes the need for&#13;
consistency between policies for the development of the national transport system and those for&#13;
other key sectors and areas, including land-use and spatial planning, protection of the&#13;
environment, and energy conservation and djv¢;sification.&#13;
2.    The Repelita VI plan, covering the  -iiod 1994/95 - 1998/99, attaches high priority to&#13;
completing the integrated modernization of the- transport sector legal and regulatory framework.&#13;
This process commenced in the late 1980s and culminated in 1992 in the passage of four new&#13;
laws to govern road traffic and transport, railways, shipping and civil aviation. It also focuses&#13;
on improving transport sector productivity, on stimulating increased participation by the private&#13;
sector and cooperatives in the provision of transport services, on extending and consolidating the&#13;
sectoral deregulation and debureaucratization initiatives introduced under Repelitas IV and V,&#13;
and on strearmlining the organization and management of government agencies and public&#13;
enterprises with transport sector responsibilities. Particular importance is placed on developing&#13;
intermodal transport, both through improved transshipment facilities and through a more&#13;
appropriate regulatory framework, and on meeting the enormous human resource development&#13;
challenges posed by the need to satisfy rapidly growing and evolving transport demands while&#13;
adopting new and more complex technologies and integrating into increasingly sophisticated&#13;
global transport systems.&#13;
3.    Within this sectoral context, the Government attaches very high priority to consolidating&#13;
and continuing initiatives to improve the performance and expand the capacity of railway&#13;
transport. The initial steps taken under Repelita V included the conversion of the State Railway&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Agency (Perjan Kereta Api or PJKA) into a more autonomous anid comnimerciallv-oriented Public&#13;
Railways Corporationi (Perulim  Kereta Api or Perumnka), an(d thc eniactmicnt ot' a niew Law on&#13;
Railwlays (UU13/1992).  This f'irst phiase in the corporatization and cormmerc ialization of the&#13;
railways hias beenl successt'ul in arresting  and revcrsing  the steadly deceriorationi in ttheir&#13;
operational and financial condition.  Passenger and frehg-tt traffic grew  rap idly during the&#13;
Repelita V period despite increasing conmpetition from other modes, the quality of' rail transport&#13;
services and die public image of the railways improved signitficaintly, and Perunika recorded&#13;
significant improvements in its productivity and financial results.&#13;
4.     These steps form part of an ongoing process that will be*ccelerated under Repelita VI,&#13;
including through the issue of the implementing regulations for UU13/1992, the further&#13;
strengthening of railway management capacities and svstems, the modernization of railway&#13;
operating regulationis and practices, and the expanded involvemenit of the privaite sector. The&#13;
specific issues to be addressed as part of this second phase of the corporatization and&#13;
coinmercialization of the subsector will include:&#13;
-  roles of governmcnit and state and private enterprises;&#13;
-  corporate structure, organization and staffing;&#13;
*  tariff-setting and compensation for non-commercial services;&#13;
*  operating procedures and regulations;&#13;
*  corporate planning, budgeting and financing&#13;
*  private sector participation;&#13;
*  human resource development;&#13;
*  environment, health and occupati6nal safety.&#13;
5.     The policies that will guide the initiatives in these areas during the Repelita VI period are&#13;
outlined below following a brief overview 'of the basic legal framework for the railway&#13;
subsector.&#13;
The Basic Legal Framework&#13;
6.     UU13/1992 requires that railway transport be developed and managed in the public&#13;
interest as an integral part of the national transport system, with the goal of serving those&#13;
passenger and freight traffics (in terms of type, volume, and distance) for which rail is superior&#13;
to other modes when account is taken of factors such energy-use efficiency, land-use efficiency,&#13;
safety, and pollution. It also outlines the respective roles to be played by government and state&#13;
and private enterprises in realizing this goal.&#13;
7.     Overall responsibility for guiding and planning the development (pembinaan) of railway&#13;
transportation is vested in government, while responsibility for implementation (pelaksanaan) is&#13;
vested in a management entity (badan penyelenggara), whichi is required to be a state-owned&#13;
enterprise (badan usaha milik negara) established in accordance with applicable laws and&#13;
regulations. Other parties are permitted to participate in railway-related activities through&#13;
cooperation (kerjasama) with the management entity.&#13;

9.     During the IRepelita VI period, UU13/1992 will be elborated through Governmlient&#13;
Regulations (Peraturan Penieriintalh) and / or Decrees of the Minister responsible for railways&#13;
(NMinister of Commilullicatiolls). These implemiienitinig regulationis will def-ine in greater detail the&#13;
respective roles of government, the management entity, and othler eni[erprises.  Thle principles&#13;
that will guide their preparation are summarized below.&#13;
10.    GnxoverniuLmt: UU13/1992 assigns to government several important and distinct roles in&#13;
relation to the railways, namely those of policy-makler, owner of the railway management entity,&#13;
owner of the railway infrastructure, and regulator.&#13;
11.    Within this context, the core role of government is to establish a policy and legal&#13;
framework that permits and promotes the effective and efficient development and management of&#13;
Lhe railway subsector while adequately safeguarding the public interest.  This encompasses&#13;
creating an environment which enables railway transport to play its proper role within an&#13;
efficient national transport system, which fosters and facilitates the participation of public and&#13;
private enterprises in the subsector, and which establishes appropriate standards and safeguards&#13;
with respect to safety, public liability, and control of market power. Primary authority in these&#13;
areas is vested in the Ministry of Communicat;ions (MOC).&#13;
12.   The government, as owner of the ~ihway infrastructure, has delegated technical and&#13;
administrative responsibility for provision andmaintenance to the management entity (Perumka),&#13;
but retains the responsibility for the associated costs and the authority for reviewing and&#13;
approving proposals for its extension and upgrading.  Government also retains the power to&#13;
impose charges for the use of infrastructure (track charges), and will give consideration to the&#13;
phased introduction of such charges in concert with the phased implementation of its adopted&#13;
policy with respect to road user charges.  Authority for coordinating the implementation of&#13;
policies in these areas is vested in MOC.&#13;
13.    The government, as owner of the management entity, has the power to appoint its&#13;
directors. It also has the power to guide and approve its corporate plans, annual budgets and&#13;
work plans and supervise their implementation, to appoint its financial auditors, and more&#13;
generally to review proposed major investment and other decisions from the standpoint of their&#13;
commercial soundness. Primary authority in this area is vested in the Ministry of Finance and&#13;
implemented through the Board of Supervisors (Dewan Pengawas).&#13;
14.   The government's role as subsector regulator is concerned with ensuring that the&#13;
development and management of the subsector is undertaken in full conformity with the adopted&#13;
policy and legal framework. Broad in scope and complex in nature, it encompasses four main&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-75-&#13;
Antwix 3.5&#13;
1';a, 4 rc 7&#13;
aspects: (a) monitoring of compliance with appliciable safeLy. environmiental1, health and olier&#13;
teclhnical standards and tile investigation of incidients relatilg to suchi aspects: (h) ensuri'n  thalt&#13;
the management entity; as railway service operator does not abuse its nmrkct powcr by clhartling&#13;
excessive tarifls; (c) reviewving, proposals f'or tihe provisioni of railway services at tarist'S lower&#13;
thian associated costs and arranging for the management entity to he appropriately compensated&#13;
tor suclh public ser-vice obli,gations; and (d) enlsuring that tthe participation ot' privaztce eniterprises&#13;
in thle subsector is secured in a manner that promotes efficiec1zy and enables the benet'its of such&#13;
efficiency to be shared with the management entity and hence with tlie users of railway services.&#13;
Primary authority in tlhese is vested in NOC.&#13;
15.    As authority ftor these dift'erenit roles must be executed through dit't'erent channels,&#13;
effective  inter-agency  communication  and coordination  wvill be crucial to ensure  overall&#13;
consistency in the subsector's management.  Careful consideration will be given to thlis in&#13;
formulating the implementing regulations for UU13/1992.&#13;
16.    Managemenint Entity:  The state corporation' designated as railway managernent entity&#13;
will be empowered and required to operate at arm's length from government as an autonomous,&#13;
entrepreneurial, profit-oriented transport corporation (s).&#13;
17.    The three main revenue generating businesses of the corporation(s) will be the operation&#13;
of railway transport services, the management of railway infrastructure on behalf of government,&#13;
and the management of its property assets in a manner that maximizes their net worth to the&#13;
corporation while satisfying the needs of efficient train operation. It will be expected to employ&#13;
best commercial and technical practices in conducting these businesses so as to provide quality&#13;
services efficiently and economically in line with users' needs (a Quality, Cost, Delivery or QCD&#13;
focus).&#13;
18.    Other Enterprises: The participation.f other enterprises in railway-related businesses is&#13;
permitted and encouraged as a means of ¢iproving efficiency through the mobilization of&#13;
managerial and technical skills not available within the management entity and as a means of&#13;
accelerating development through the mobilization of private financial resources. The types of&#13;
business open for participation by othe; enterprises comprise the operation of rail transport&#13;
services, the provision and / or maintenance of infrastructure, the provision of supporting&#13;
services, and development of property owned by the management entity.&#13;
Corporate Structure. Organization and Staffing&#13;
19.    The government is cornmitted to ensuring that the future structure, internal organization&#13;
and staffing of the railway management entity will enable it to respond efficiently and effectively&#13;
to increasing demands and evolving requirements in the many different transport markets it&#13;
serves in the face of strengthening competition from other modes.&#13;
20.    Proposals are now being prepared for the early conversion of Perumnka into a state-&#13;
owvned limited liability company (Persero). It is envisaged that the internal organization of the&#13;
All references to "the railway management entity" should be interpreted as rcferring to one or morc stated-&#13;
owned corporations that are empowered to manage railway infrastructurc and services.&#13;

21.    The mana-ement entity wvill also be empowered anid requir-edl to streamline its lower-level&#13;
organization structure so as to eliminate unnecessary managenient layers and facilitate improved&#13;
communication and coordination between units. It will also be expect to align its staffing to its&#13;
busilness needs, and will be required to prepare a programi for increasing labior productivity to&#13;
appropriate "best practice" levels and for recruiting suftcicieht appropriaitely trained and&#13;
experieniced  personinel to  maintain and operate  its increasingly  sophisticated  technical and&#13;
manageinent systenis satisfactorily.   Accordingly, the management entity  will be granted&#13;
increased autonoiny with respect to personnel remuneration policy. Thie government recognizes&#13;
that these changes will lilkely necessitate some reduction in the size of the work-force, and will&#13;
bear responsibility for compensatin, personnel whose positions are so af'fected.&#13;
Tariff Settino, and Compensationi for Non-Commercial Services&#13;
22.    The management entity will in general be empowered to set the tariffs and rates for&#13;
railway services at levels that will enable it to cover the associated financial costs of provision,&#13;
including track charges if and when levied, and to earn a reasonable return on assets employed.&#13;
The calculation of the capital charge component of the computed service costs will take account,&#13;
inter alia, of whether the assets employed are suitable for use in operating other types of services&#13;
and of whether further investment in such assets is envisaged.&#13;
23.    The government as regulator may require the management entity to operate services at&#13;
tariffs less than those required for normal comrmercial operation. Such decisions will be taken on&#13;
a case by case basis, with the governmentpThyiding direct compensation to the management&#13;
entity through an appropriately structured p-lb iC service obligation financing mechanism.  For&#13;
these purposes, management entity will be reqiuired to provide government with such market and&#13;
cost data as it may reasonably require for the purposes of evaluating the case for fixing tariffs at&#13;
less than commercial levels, of computing the appropriate level of compensation, and of&#13;
monitoring the actual costs and benefits of such subsidies.&#13;
Coraorate Planning. Budgeting and Financing&#13;
24.    The increased commercial autonomy to be given to the management entity will be&#13;
balanced by a requirement that it become more accountable to government, as owner, for its&#13;
performance.&#13;
Consideration is being given to the creation of separate subsidiarics for Java and Sumatra, and to the&#13;
replacement of the current "functional" top-level management structure with one designed on strategic&#13;
business units. Thus, for example, a Java subsidiary could have directors responsible inter-urban passenger&#13;
services, urban passenger services, freight services, property, and operations support. Key support business&#13;
units, such as infrastructure maintenance and rollingstock provision, could be reorganized as profit or&#13;
investment centers and later considered as candidates for corporatization.&#13;

25.   Medium-termii corporate planning and annual budgeting and work planning will be thle key&#13;
mecthaniiisnms throughl which increazsed accountability is achieved. Corporate pl.lns and budgets&#13;
will be required to elaeonopaiss activities related to infrastructure provision aind mainlten-c as&#13;
wcll as to the operation of railway services, an1d henice to incorporate associated financial&#13;
transfers fronm government.&#13;
26.   The Supervisory Board will require evidence that all investmnent proposals have been&#13;
subject to appropriate financial analyses and are consistent with the commercial objectives of the&#13;
management entity, and that operating plans provide for ettficient and productive use of&#13;
rollinnstock and other resources to provide services that will yid a satisfactory retuin whcn&#13;
account is takien of public service compensationi payments.  Approved corporate plans and&#13;
budgets will be viewed as being contracts betweeni the management enitity and the government as&#13;
its owner.&#13;
27.   The government for its part will commit to providing financing in line with the levels&#13;
indicated in approved corporate plans and stipulated in annual budgets. In addition to bearing the&#13;
capital costs of infrastructure provision and the recurrent costs of infrastructure maintenance and&#13;
public service obligation compensation, government will in the medium term also continue to&#13;
finance part of the needed investments in rollingstock and other management entity facilities.&#13;
Once the public service obligation financing mechanism is in place, such financing will be in the&#13;
form of loans rather than increased equity participation.&#13;
Operating Regulations and Procedures&#13;
28.   The government will ensure that the regulations and operating procedures for the railway&#13;
subsector are amended in line with current best practices. The changes made will be designed to&#13;
enable the benefits of investments in new teihnology to be maximized, the life-cycle costs of&#13;
track and other assets to be minimized u-gi timely maintenance, and to ensure that the&#13;
development and operation of railways is co6T6cted with due regard to protecting the safety and&#13;
health of the public and railway personnel and to containing adverse environmental and social&#13;
impacts.&#13;
Strategy for Expanded Private Sector Participation&#13;
29.   The government will foster increased opportunities for the private sector to participate in&#13;
the railway subsector, including in the operation of train services, in the conduct of supporting&#13;
businesses, and in the development of the property assets of the management entity.  Such&#13;
participation will implemented through cooperation agreements with the management entity and&#13;
will be solicited in a manner consistent with the intent of UU13/1992 and other applicable&#13;
regulations. It will be based on an equitable sharing of risks and rewards and will have due&#13;
regard to safeguarding the public interest. The mechanisms for securing such participation,&#13;
which will be designed to promote competition where possible, will be elaborated in Government&#13;
Regulations and other supporting implementing regulations as required by UU13/1992.&#13;
30.   In the longer term, the government may consider involving the private enterprises in the&#13;
railway subsector in ways that extend beyond those provided for in UU13/1992. The planned&#13;

Hiumiian Resource Development&#13;
3 1.   The government recognizes that upgrading  the skills of' railway managenient and&#13;
technical personnel is a prerequisite for the creationi of an eff-icienit modc-rn railway capable of&#13;
handling rapid growth in demand through the effective utilization of increasingly sophisticated&#13;
techniologies and systenis.  Accordingly, high priority will be giveni to establishing a hunian&#13;
resource developmenit masterplan for the railway subsector andl to,+naking availlble the resources&#13;
required for the initial phases of its implemilentationi.&#13;
EInvironmenit, Healthi and (Occuipational Safeta&#13;
32.   The government is concerned to ensure that the developimienit and operation of railways is&#13;
managed in a manner that minimizes adverse impacts on the environnient and tile community and&#13;
that protects the health and safety of those employed in the railway subsector. Accordingly, the&#13;
governmnet will require that the maanagement entity establish a competent unit to-guide and&#13;
oversee the implementation of appropriate construction and operating standards and practices.&#13;
Implementation of the Policy Framework&#13;
33.   A comprehensive and carefully integrated plan for the implementation of these policies&#13;
during the remainder of the Repelita VI period is being developed by the concerned agencies&#13;
under the overall coordination of the Minister of Communications. Particular attention will be&#13;
given to the phasing of the component activities having careful regard both to the times required&#13;
to conduct the necessary planning and analysis-and, where needed, to amend existing regulations,&#13;
and to the need to proceed with due sensitivity and care in making changes that will have&#13;
significant social impacts.&#13;

IRAILWVAY EFFICIENCY PROJECT&#13;
PUBLIC/COVIMUNITY SERVICE, OBLIGlATIONS&#13;
I1.    The term Public Service Obligation (PSO) or Communitly Service Obligation (CSO)&#13;
is used to describe services or products that enterprises are requilcd by governments to&#13;
provide at tarifts or prices that arc not commercially attractive.'  SucIh obligations are&#13;
common in the transport sector, withi the losses on requircd noy-commercial services (e.g.&#13;
rural rail and late night bus services) havinig traditionally becel oltset by internal cross-&#13;
subsidy from other highly profitable services (c.g. trunk routc and peak periodl services). In&#13;
some instances, such as Indonesia's railways, governimients havc provided indirect subsidies&#13;
for such scrviccs through the injection of capital or the under-recovery of intrastructure or&#13;
other costs.&#13;
2.     The concept of governmeits providing explicit direct compensation lor imposed&#13;
public service obligations is not new, although their systematic application is compar.atively&#13;
recent. During the 1930s, for example, the New South WValcs State Railways developed&#13;
some rural branch lines in fringe agricultural districts in return for negotiated subsidies from&#13;
the State Treasury designed to compensate for the associated operating losses. Very similar&#13;
arrangements were applied much earlier in India, with private railways receiving&#13;
compensation (through guaranteed dividends) up until their take-over in early 1900s.&#13;
3.     tviore recently, PSOs achieved widespread prominence in the EEC, when it was&#13;
decided that subsidies to nationalized steel and other industries should be madc explicit. One&#13;
of the best known examples of their recent app!ication in the transport sector was in the UK&#13;
following the Beeching Report on British Railways (BR). In the latc 1960s, the Government&#13;
elected to provide explicit compensation t,i.'in return for its continuing to operate a range&#13;
of uneconomic services that were consi&amp;red politically necessary.  Compensation was&#13;
provided by central government on a ser'vice-by-servicc basis, in part because certain&#13;
suburban services also received compensation from local governments through regional&#13;
Passenger Transport Executives.&#13;
4.     The BR PSO compensation payments were computed using what becamc known as&#13;
the "Cooper Brothers Formula", which was essentially a marginal costing approach. As&#13;
more services became eligible for PSO compensation, however, BR was forced to cover its&#13;
residual fixed infrastructure costs from a declining number of "commercial" services. This&#13;
necessitated amending the approach, with each section of infrastructure being assigned to a&#13;
nominal "owner" who was responsible for funding the fixed costs and who reccived PSO&#13;
compensation towards these. The costing procedures wcre reasonably straight-forward, and&#13;
their implementation was subject to vcry careful audit.&#13;
PSO is used herc as a gencric tcrmn for all forms or explicit direct compcnsation 1rom govcrnments to enterprises&#13;
in respect of the obligatory provision of non-cconomic scrvices that would not othenvise be ofTcred by a&#13;
commercially-oricntcd cntity.&#13;

Railvways (fre igiht services, in:cludlhgm an experi mental -bounty'' I;Or :,\tcrnial road costs savecd&#13;
by having freight moved by rail), and Queensland Rail (to compensate f'or the removal of'the&#13;
prcvious cross-subsidy from coal export trat'tfic to passenger services). I'SO comrpcelsaltionl is&#13;
also providcc for rural services in scctors such as posts and telccommILunicaltionls.&#13;
6.      In New  Zealand, local authorities have provided explicit compensation tor non-&#13;
commercial suLburbani services in Auckland and Wellington. Tly.sc havc bcen continIued as&#13;
comiliercial contraLcts following the recent privatization of New Zealanid Rail.   in Malaysia,&#13;
PSO compcnsation is providcd for some ot' now-corporatized KTN'l's passengcr serviccs.&#13;
Likewise Indonesia has for several years becn providing PSOs tor conitracted pioneer air and&#13;
shipping services, some of which are provided by private operators.&#13;
7.     The approachcs used to compute PSO compensation payments vary considerably. In&#13;
some instances, amounts are calculated on the basis of defined marginal or avcragc cost&#13;
principles, in others block grants are provided to enable providers to achieve a satisfactory&#13;
"bottom line", and in some payments are determined by the competitive selectioni of servicc&#13;
providers through a tendering process in which compensation amount is the bidding variable.&#13;
8.     The provision of PSO  compensation has two important advantages over more&#13;
traditional forms of indirect and often hidden subsidy. Firstly, it enables governments to&#13;
weigh the perceived benefits of subsidized services against the financial costs it must bear in&#13;
order to maintain them.  Secondly, it opens the door to justified non-commercial public&#13;
services being provided more efficiently by the private sector.&#13;

ON TIM1;E 1"IrEV'ENTI'VE MAINTENANCF, SYST1E1M WVITII U               XNIT ClX0ANGI.&#13;
1.   \A dicsel locomotive consists of a fraimc and somc twenty live inajor comiiponicilts,&#13;
inclUdin'g the main diesel enginc, the traiction oencrator or alternator, the coinpressor, the&#13;
traction motors, and many others. All componients have ditffierit timie intervals between&#13;
succcssivc overhauls. At present, Peruiiiika loconiotive com)polineits are overhaauled when&#13;
locomliotives are overhiauled (a  senmi " overhauil Occurs cver,\) two years and a gencral&#13;
overlhaul occurs every four years).&#13;
2.     Since components actually have expected service lives corresponding to time periods&#13;
between successivc overhauls of one to eight years, many componients are not being&#13;
overhauled at thcir most cost effective interval. Some componcnts get their overhiaul too&#13;
early, whichi results in inefricient use of time and spare parts. Some componients gct their&#13;
overhaul too late, which may result in an in-service failure and a more costly overhaul in&#13;
terms of time and spare parts. The components that get their overhaul late have a"higher&#13;
probability of failure in service. Thus, their reliability is low. These components also run&#13;
the risk of being damaged beyond repair, which results in a costly replacement program.&#13;
3.     If each and every component on a locomotive is overhauled when it is duc, an ON&#13;
TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE SYSTEM is in place. When a component is thus&#13;
overhauled on time, in-service failures should decrease, and the reliability of each&#13;
component should increase. With the increase in reliability of components, the reliability of&#13;
the locomotive itself should increase. This:jn turn will improve the reliability of service of&#13;
the railway. Moreover, the availability of the locomotive for use will incrcasc, raising its&#13;
productivity.&#13;
4.     Under the current maintenance system on Perumka, when a component is ready to be&#13;
overhauled, it is taken off the locomotive. Once off the locomotive, the component is taken&#13;
apart, parts changed, serviced, reassefnbled, and tested. After overhaul the component is&#13;
reinstalled on the locomotive, and only then is the locomotive ready to pull trains. The&#13;
process of overhauling a component takes a considerable length of time. During all that time&#13;
the locomotive is out of service and does not perform any service. It is not earning any&#13;
money.&#13;
5.     To shorten the out of service time of the locomotive, the UNIT EXCHANGE&#13;
MAINTENANCE SYSTEM is also introduced. In essence, thc unit exchange system&#13;
provides a ready-for-use component beforc a similar component is removed from a&#13;
locomotive for overhaul.  The exchange unit can be installed immcdiatcly when the&#13;
component to be overhauled is taken off the locomotive.  This process shortens the&#13;
locomotive maintenance down-time and increases its availability for service.&#13;
6.     During a locomotive general overhaul at the worklshop, all components arc taken off&#13;
and overhauled. On Perumka at present (without a unit exchange maintenance system) the&#13;
general overhaul lasts about 70 days.  With a unit exchange maintenancc systcm, thc&#13;

meain an increasc of about 2 I ready-to-rull locomotives, without incrcasin,g  the size ol the&#13;
fleet. This Would result in a saving in the ownership cost and in the fixed maiililnaclilc cost&#13;
per locomotive owned of 2! locomotlives.&#13;
S.     Apart from  the benctfis of the Unlit exchangc mnaint&amp;zince systenm, the on-tilme&#13;
preventiLve maintenance svstem11 also can lead to miore serviceable locomotives in the lleet&#13;
duLe to less downtime tor ml;aintenianice. And with the anticipated im1provemllent in locomotive&#13;
reliability, the currenit daily routine checks ol locomotives which are necessitated by the high&#13;
component failure rates can be eliminatod, resulting in more cost savings. It is estinmated that&#13;
Perumk-a's total beneFit from  the Oni-time Preventivc Maintenance System  vitht Unit&#13;
Exchangc should be the equivalent of adding 25 to 30 locomotives to the fleet, an increase&#13;
equal to one-fifth of the fAect.&#13;
9.     Under the proposed project, unit exchange of most components would be done in the&#13;
Semarang or Bandung locomotive depots or running shops. Exchange of diesel engines and&#13;
main generators would be done in Yogyakarta Workshop. General overhauls, which occur&#13;
every 6 to 8 years, also would be accomplished in the Yogyakarta Workshop.&#13;
I0.    After components are taken off locomotives in the Semarang and Bandung depots,&#13;
they would be sent to Yogyakarta Workshop for overhaul. The workshop would repair and&#13;
overhaul the components, maintaining a pool of ready-to-use components for dispatch to the&#13;
depot when needed in exchange for defectiec components removed from locomotives. By&#13;
concentrating the repair of componerir- n Yogvakarta Workshop, the quality of&#13;
workmanship should improve.&#13;
11.    Yogyakarta Workshop manages the unit exchange pools, but both depots and the&#13;
workshop must know at any time where the status of various components (including those on&#13;
locomotives) and when they are due for overhaul. To monitor all 3,600 components in a&#13;
fleet of 142 locomotives, a master locomotive maintenance schedule must be prepared and&#13;
kept up to date. This is best done by a computer system to provide adequate monitoring,&#13;
with a data base that includes serial numbers and names of components, their location and&#13;
status, and their overhaul date. With a computer in the workshop linked on line and in real&#13;
time with similar computers in each depot, the system should provide all necessary&#13;
information for managing the unit exchange maintenance system. Each depot would know&#13;
what component on which locomotive must be exchanged when. The workshop also would&#13;
know the stock levels of components in the depots and be able to anticipate the depots' needs&#13;
as well as its own for repaired components. With the information system, Yogyakarta&#13;
Workshop also can monitor the overhaul workload of its various shops and plan the&#13;
availability of parts and materials along with the shop loading.&#13;

b)     Hows n yian  depots arc required? Perumkia now has about 25 dcpots on Java, which&#13;
is far too many for a unit exchange maintenance systemn. 'ossibly twenty depots will&#13;
have to bc closed.&#13;
c)     What equipment, facilitics, and  manpower arc required  by the depots to&#13;
performii the exchange of components properly, safely, and  in the shortest&#13;
possiblc time?&#13;
d)     What equipment, facilities, and  manpowvcr are  required  bv  Yogyakarta&#13;
Workshop? The work-shop will need some additional machinery and rearrangement&#13;
to improve work tlow. Cleaning, de-fueling, and dce-oiling facilities, located outside&#13;
the shop buildinas, will be needed to help keep the shops clean. A dirty shop is not&#13;
conducive to the performance of accuirate and high quality work, such as is required&#13;
for engine, governor, and bearing airs.&#13;
e)     WVhat will be required to insure proper quality?  The depots and the workshop&#13;
will need an operational Quality Control Organization to help ensure that overhauled&#13;
components are in an as-new condition when they leave the workshop for the depot&#13;
and that the components installed by the depot are aligned properly.&#13;
f)     What is needed  to secure adequate supply to the  vorklshop  of piarts and&#13;
materials for component repair and replacenient?   An  leficient parts supply&#13;
(including purchase authorization and funding) must be put in place to insure the&#13;
availability of parts when needed by the workshop and to ensure the prudent usc of&#13;
spare parts' funds.&#13;
g)     What training is needed? Training must be provided for maintcnancc craftsmen,&#13;
quality control inspectors, supervisors, and managers to make things happcn in the&#13;
proper manner. Especially important is that the training of craftsmen must involvc&#13;
hands-on training based on step-by-step shop procedures wvhich are now almost non-&#13;
existent.&#13;

RAILWAY EFFICIENCY PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AND SCHEDULE&#13;
1.    Overall responsibility for coordinating and guiding the project's implementation will&#13;
be vested in the IACC which has already been established by Ministerial Decree. This&#13;
Committee will be assisted by the RTF on which Perumka is represented at director level.&#13;
The project's policy component will be implemented through this structure (Chart on&#13;
Implementation Arrangements).&#13;
1.    Technical management of the Jakarta-Bandung Corridor, track upgrading and&#13;
maintenance, and locomotive maintenance components, together with the Perumka&#13;
institutional strengthening component will be vested in a Project Management Unit&#13;
established within Perumka (PMUP).&#13;
3.    Reporting to the Project Management Unit Perumka (PMUP) will be three Project&#13;
Implementation Units (PIUs) staffed full-time by Perumka personnel:&#13;
a)   PIU for Jakarta-Bandung Corridor improvements and track maintenance system,&#13;
including related training. Both the Jakarta-Bandung Corridor improvements and the&#13;
track maintenance system would be the responsibility of one PIU in order to plan and&#13;
coordinate track construction and rail installation in the Corridor and elsewhere on&#13;
Java.&#13;
b)   PIU for Locomotive Unit Exchange Maintenance System, including related training.&#13;
c)   PIU for Perumka institutional development.&#13;
4.    Consultants financed by GOI and the Bank would assist the PMUP and the PIUs in&#13;
implementing the project, and their appointment would be a condition of Bank approval of&#13;
the associated construction and equipment procurement contracts. Because of the complexity&#13;
of the interfaces between the various activities and the need for careful scheduling, the&#13;
consultants should be assisting the PIUs right from the start. Thus, for the Jakarta-Bandung&#13;
Corridor Development and the Track Upgrading and Maintenance System components, Bank&#13;
approval of the contracts for track works, supply and installation of signaling, and supply of&#13;
new rail will be contingent upon the consultants assisting Perumka in the implementation of&#13;
these components having been appointed.&#13;
5.    The project management and implementation schedule is shown in the following.&#13;

ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
A. Jakarta -Bandung Corridor Improvements&#13;
1.     Definition of the Corridor: This investment component involves the corridor Jakarta-Cikampek-&#13;
Bandung. The double track railway line between Jakarta-Cikampek serves not only traffic to and from&#13;
Bandung, but also carries all trains to and from points east of Jakarta, such as traffic to and from&#13;
Surabaya-Solo-Yogyakarta-Cirebon. and Surabaya-Semarang-Cirebon. The investment plans for the&#13;
corridor infrastructure improvements are based on the total train operations over the Jakarta-Cikampek-&#13;
Bandung corridor. The economic and financial evaluation considers only those traffic flows to/from&#13;
Jakarta with Bandung as their origin/destination and the corresponding investments that contribute only to&#13;
these traffic flows (See the subsection "Investments" below).&#13;
2.     Base Case and Project Case: Base case scenario represents the case where a minimum level of&#13;
investment is made which is necessary to maintain the present situation and provide the train services that&#13;
are now being offered. Project case scenario represents the situation in which the proposed project is&#13;
initiated in 1997 and fully implemented by 2001.&#13;
3.     A 20-year period after project completion (year 2001) is taken as the evaluation period, i.e., from&#13;
2002 to 2021.&#13;
4.     Tariffs:  For the base case, no future tariff increase is assumed for either rail passenger or&#13;
container services. For the project case, a 10% increase for rail passenger service is assumed for 2002, the&#13;
first year after project completion, but no tariff increase for rail container service is assumed over the&#13;
evaluation period.&#13;
,.    Passenger Traffic Forecast:  Based on the historical trend and the expected growth in&#13;
urbanization, economic activities and personal income, a growth rate of 8% per year is assumed for both&#13;
executive and business passengers.&#13;
6.     Price elasticity of executive class is assumed to be -0.5. and for business class it is -0.7.&#13;
7.     When the toil road between Cikampek and Padalarang opens in 2000, it is assumed that 10% of&#13;
executive passengers and 15% of business passengers will switch to road.&#13;
8.     For the base case, it is projected that total executive and business passengers would reach 4.0&#13;
million by 2003, using up the available track capacity. For the project case, track capacity, which is&#13;
expandcd by the proposed project, is projected to be reached in 2017, when the total passengers are&#13;
estimated to approach 11 million.&#13;
9.     Number of trains per day is estimated on the basis of average daily passenger demand plus an extra&#13;
10% for peak demand. One type of train composition is with 8 coach/400 seat capacity, another with 12&#13;
coach/640 seat capacity, both assuming 85% occupancy rate.&#13;
10.    Container Traffic Forecast: For the rail container transport, no growth is assumed during the&#13;
project implementation period. After project implementation, the traffic between Gedebage and Tanjung&#13;
Priok is projected to grow at 4% per year and approach 120.000 TEUs by 2021, averaging 2.8% per year&#13;
from 1997 to 2021, and the traffic between Cibungur and Tanjung Priok is projected to grow at 1%&#13;
initially, then at 2% per year, averaging 1.4% per year from 1997 to 2021.&#13;
11.    When the toll road between Cikampek and Padalarang opens in 2000, it is assumed that 10% of the&#13;
container traffic will be diverted to road.&#13;
12.    Number of container trains is estimated by assuming 33 containers (20 foot) per train with 90%&#13;
occupancy rate (i.e., 30 containers per train).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-112-                                     Annex 5.1&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
13.    For the base case, track capacity is reached at the current level of four trains per day per direction&#13;
and no additional container trains can be transported from then on. For the project case, the expanded&#13;
track capacity is sufficient to accommodate container traffic over the evaluation period.&#13;
14.   Investments: Because the Jakarta-Bandung traffic flow accounts for only 35% of the total traffic&#13;
running between Bekasi-Cikampek, 40% of the proposed investments within the Bekasi-Cikampek section&#13;
are allocated to the Jakarta-Bandung traffic flows. A 10% physical contingency allowance is included in&#13;
the total investment cost.&#13;
15.    For the project case, a 10% efficiency improvement is assumed for rolling stock utilization as a&#13;
result of reduced turnaround time.&#13;
16.    Expected life of infrastructure and rolling stock are assumed as follows: 25 years for signaling and&#13;
telecommunications, 30 years for track and bridge, 25 years for locomotive, and 40 years for coach and&#13;
wagon. The investment residual values (infrastructure and rolling stock) are treated as positive revenues at&#13;
the end of the evaluation period.&#13;
17.    Operating Costs: Operating costs are separated into (fixed) infrastructure maintenance costs,&#13;
which is independent of traffic volume, and (variable) direct operational costs, which is dependent on traffic&#13;
volume.&#13;
18.   Infrastructure maintenance costs are estimated to increase by RpO.9 billion due to tamping and to&#13;
decrease by RpO.7 billion due to installation of continuously welded rail. Maintenance of modern signaling&#13;
is estimated to be 1% of investments in the first three years and 3% after that. The maintenance costs in&#13;
the current situation, RpO.3 billion, is subtracted.&#13;
19.    Direct operational costs consist of rolling stock maintenance costs, fuel and lubricants costs, and&#13;
personnel costs. They are estimated as follows:&#13;
Unit costs (Rp/train-km)             Personnel        Fuel       Maintenance&#13;
I locomotive and 8 coaches              560           1,200         3,636&#13;
2 locomotives and 12 coaches            900           2,400         6,129&#13;
1 locomotive container train            280           1,160         7,479&#13;
2 locomotive container train            280           2,320        11,556&#13;
Sources: "The Jakarta-Bandung Railway Corridor," by Railplan, et al, 1995.&#13;
20.    For the project case, the operating costs are assumed to be 10% lower than those above due to&#13;
reduced trip time.&#13;
21.    Economic and Financial Analysis: The economic analysis compares total costs between the base&#13;
case and the project case. The estimated total costs include rail and road capital and maintenance costs,&#13;
rolling stock and vehicle ownership and operating costs, transit time costs, and air pollution and accident&#13;
costs.&#13;
22.    For the base case where the rail capacity will be reached in 2003, road provision and maintenance&#13;
costs and vehicle operating costs are estimated assuming that the additional rail passengers that would have&#13;
traveled by rail will have to travel by road due to lack of rail capacity. For the project case, these road&#13;
costs are zero because the passengers will be able to travel by rail.&#13;
23.    Three types of passenger road vehicles are considered: car, small bus and large bus. Average&#13;
occupancy is assumed as 1.5 for car, 15 for small bus, and 30 for large bus. Modal shares for those who&#13;
switch from rail to road are assumed as 50% for car. 30% for small bus, and 20% for large bus.&#13;
&#13;

24.    For container transport by road, it is assumed that 50% of the trucks carry one 20 foot container,&#13;
and the other 50% carry either one 40 foot container or two 20 foot containers. It is further assumed that&#13;
containers, combining full and empty, on average hold 10 tons per 20 foot container.&#13;
25.    Unit road provision and maintenance costs and VOCs are assumed as follows:&#13;
(Rp/vehicle-km)                 Vehicle operating costs    Road provision and maintenance&#13;
costs&#13;
Car                                      244                            131&#13;

26.    Transit times between Jakarta city center to Bandung city center for vehicles before and after the&#13;
opening of the new toll road between Cikampek and Padalarang and for rail before and after the&#13;
implementation of the proposed project are assumed as follows:&#13;

27.    On the basis of a survey on rail passengers (executive and business classes) between Jakarta and&#13;
Bandung (carried out in 1991 for the Land Transport Development Plan study), a time value placed by the&#13;
executive and business travelers is estimated at Rp 1,400 per hour. The survey also showed that over 40%&#13;
of the passengers travel for business/official purposes, and that nearly 70% of the passengers own at least&#13;
one car. Separate analyses with and without transit time cost savings are conducted in order to assess the&#13;
impacts of this factor.&#13;
28.    Air pollution and accident costs are also considered. The unit costs are assumed as follows:&#13;

29.    The cost difference betweeni road and rail is calculated. Accountinlg for data uncertailnties and&#13;
differences between levels of economic development, only 50% of the difference is counted in the&#13;
benefit calculation. Moreover, separate analyses with and without air pollution and accident costs are&#13;
conducted in order to assess the impacts of these factors.&#13;
30.    A financial analysis has also been carried out. The analysis compares net rail reveniues (rail&#13;
revenues minus rail and rolling stock investmenit and maintenance costs and train operating costs)&#13;
between the base case and the project case and no road infrastl-uctLure and vehicle costs are i'ivolved in&#13;
the calculation. Assumptions about rail infrastructure and rolling stock costs and tiaini operatinig costs&#13;
are the same as those in the economilc analysis.&#13;
B. Track Maintenance Svsteni&#13;
3 1.   Investments: Because new rail will need to be installed regardless of thle project, for the base&#13;
case, the investments would consist of: i) new and secondary rail installation: and ii) main track&#13;
restoration. For the project case, the investmenits would include two additional componienits finanicedl&#13;
ulider the project, i.e.: iii) the rail reclamation yard and rail train; and iv) the techniical assistance and&#13;
training. Furthermore, it is assumed that under the new procedures introduced throughl the project, the&#13;
costs incurred under items i) (new and secondarv rail) and ii) (main track restoration) would be some&#13;
I 0% higher than under the base case.&#13;
32.    Track Capital and Maintenance Costs: Current annual track capital investmilncit and&#13;
mainlten1ance costs for Perumka (including Java and Sumatra networks) are estinated at US$1 19 million&#13;
and US$43 million, respectively.&#13;
33.    For the base case, the costs on the Java network are estinated on the basis of track lengtlh. Thle&#13;
track on Java is 3,671 km long, while the total track lengthl under Perumka is 5,040 km. It follows that&#13;
the base case track capital investment and maintenance costs for the Java network are at US$86.7 nillion&#13;
and US$3 1.3 million per year, respectively.&#13;
34.    For the project case, the improved maintenance system is assumed to spread over the whole Java&#13;
network over a period of seven years, from 1997 to 2003. As the main benefit of the system is to extend&#13;
the life of rail, up to three times the current level, the corresponding track capital costs would decrease&#13;
accordingly as the improved maintenance system gradually spreads over the Java network. When the&#13;
new system reaches the whole Java network, the annual track capital costs would be just one third of the&#13;
current level. The assumptions on the specific percentages of track under the improved maintenance&#13;
system and the corresponding track capital costs are given as follows:&#13;
Year    % of Track        % of Track       Annual Track Capital Cost&#13;
Under Improved  Under Current             (US$ millioll)&#13;
Maintenance      Maintenance&#13;
1997         10 %              90 %        (IO% /3+90%)*86.7=80.9&#13;
1998         25 %              75 %        (25%/3+75%)*86.7=72.2&#13;
1999         40 %              60 %        (40%/3+60%)*86.7=63.6&#13;
2000          55 %             45 %        (55%/3+45%)*86.7=54.9&#13;
2001          70 %              30 %       (70%/3+30%)*86.7=46.2&#13;
2002          85 %              15 %       (85%/3+15%)*86.7=37.6&#13;
2003         100 %               0 %       (100%/3+0%)*86.7=28.9&#13;
Later years are assumed the same as year 2003&#13;

35.    Track maintenance costs under the improved maintenance system are assumed to increase over the&#13;
project implementation period to twice the current level. The specific assumptions are as follows:&#13;
Year      % of Track Maint     Track Maintenance&#13;
Cost Increase Over    Costs (US$ million)&#13;
Current Level&#13;
1997              60 %         (1+60%)*31.3=50.1&#13;
1998              70 %         (1+70%)*31.3=53.2&#13;
1999              80 %         (1+80%)*31.3=56.4&#13;
2000              90 %         (1+90%)*31.3=59.5&#13;
2001             100 %         (1+100%)*31.3=62.6&#13;
Later years are assumed the same as year 2001&#13;
36.    Economic Analysis: The economic analysis compares the net investment costs and savings in&#13;
track capital and maintenance costs between the base case and the project case. Expected savings in rolling&#13;
stock operating costs are not considered. A 40-year period is assumed as the evaluation period. Longer&#13;
periods would not affect the results due to a discount rate of 12% and the high intemal rate of returns.&#13;
C. Locomotive Unit Exchange Maintenance Program&#13;
37.    As discussed in the main text, the proposed unit exchange program combined with the on-time&#13;
preventive maintenance system is expected to add an equivalent of 28 locomotives to the current diesel&#13;
electric locomotive fleet in Java, as a result of improved locomotive reliability and availability, and&#13;
replacement of daily and every other day checks by monthly checks. The benefits are the avoided&#13;
locomotive capital costs and maintenance costs. Locomotive unit cost is estimated at US$1.5 million per&#13;
unit and annual maintenance cost is at US$75,000 per year. Total annualized savings are estimated at&#13;
Rpl4 billion (US$6.2 million) per year. This saving is assumed to realize gradually over a period of six&#13;
years, beginning at the fourth year of the project implementation and reaching the full extent four years&#13;
after project completion. A life of 30 years is assumed for locomotives.&#13;

INDONESIA&#13;
RAILWAY EFFICIENCY PROJECT&#13;
FINANCIAL EVALUATION&#13;
Background&#13;
I.    The Indonesian railways up until December 31, 1990 was owned and controlled by&#13;
the Government of Indonesia. The book value of fixed assets on December 31, 1990 was&#13;
Rpl,336 trillion (US$700 million), together with inventories of Rpl24 billion ($65 million)&#13;
and the cash and receivable of Rp177 billion ($93 million).&#13;
2.    On January 1, 1991, GOI converted the railways from a departmental agency (Perjan,&#13;
PJKA) whose income and expenses were treated as part of the state budget to a separate legal&#13;
entity as a state corporation (Perum, Perumka). With this change, GOI transferred the&#13;
ownership of workshops, depots, telecommunications facilities, motive power and rolling&#13;
stock, and related land to Perumka while retaining the ownership of major part of the railway&#13;
infrastructure (rails, buildings, signals, terminals, bridges, land crossings and overhead&#13;
electric lines). The value of fixed assets in Perumka accounts was reduced by Rp554 billion&#13;
($290 million) representing the written down value of track assets which remained with GOT.&#13;
Accounting, Budgeting and Auditing&#13;
3.    In late 1980s PJKA progressively introduced a new double entry accounting system&#13;
(System Acontasi Baru, SAB). The fiscal year was changed from April-March to January-&#13;
December. An improved classification of accounts was introduced. The costs are now&#13;
analyzed by type of expenses (material, labor and general), by cost center and by operating&#13;
function. Staff costs are now being allocated to various activity centers.&#13;
4.    Perumka regularly prepares a five-year corporate plan with detailed annual budget.&#13;
The most recent corporate plan covers the five-year period of 1995-99.&#13;
5.    Perumka accounts are annually audited by the Financial and Development&#13;
Supervisory Board of GOI (Badan Rengawas Keerangan dar Pembangunan, BPKP). The&#13;
auditors are regarded as independent auditors using generally accepted auditing rules and&#13;
standards. The Bank has accepted them for other projects. The same auditors will be used&#13;
for the proposed project. The audit reports for Perumka are generally late by nine months.&#13;
This does not help the management for taking prompt remedial actions.&#13;
Costing&#13;
6.    With the help of consultants financed by the Bank's Railway Technical Assistance&#13;
Project (Loan 2891-IND), a computerized railway traffic costing system was satisfactorily&#13;
established, in which the key concept of railway's long-run variable costs was introduced.&#13;
Perumka staff was trained in all aspects of the costing as per the Project Completion Report&#13;
(No.13914) of January 19, 1995. The costing system is now used for investment analysis&#13;
and tariff adjustments. Some improvements are necessary in the following areas:&#13;
a) The cost analysis includes only direct and indirect costs but excludes the general&#13;
costs. Many of the general cost items are either partially or fully variable with traffic&#13;
and should be included in the cost analysis so that tariffs adequately reflect costs;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-118-&#13;
Annex 6.1&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
b) Although the management accounting concept is now being used, its scope and level&#13;
should be expanded and improved;&#13;
c) The reliability and timeliness of the statistical and financial data need to be&#13;
improved. At present there is no direct responsibility assigned to any particular&#13;
division of Perumka for collection of required data;&#13;
d) Some technical advice is needed in rationalization and identification of non-&#13;
remunerative railway services, budgeting, PSO calculation and tariff restructuring.&#13;
e) a computerized financial management information system should be set up so that&#13;
reliable, relevant reports can be prepared and submitted to the management on time.&#13;
A direct computer link between the headquarters and regional offices would&#13;
substantially reduce the transmission of information from origin to destination.&#13;
Past and Present Financial Performance&#13;
7.    The removal of major railway infrastructure from Perumka's accounts has helped&#13;
Perumka improve its financial accounts for the following reasons: (i) GOI pays Perumka an&#13;
annual contribution toward repairs and maintenance of GOI owned infrastructure; (ii) a&#13;
substantial reduction in depreciation and interest charges on infrastructure assets transferred&#13;
to GOI; and (iii) all railway revenues are shown in Perumka's accounts. The net income&#13;
therefore improved immediately by about Rp8O billion (Rp3O billion from GOI for track&#13;
repairs and maintenance and Rp5O billion saved by Perumka for depreciation and interest&#13;
charges for track). For Perumka, however, the track maintenance still has a substantial&#13;
backlog and there is under-funding by Perumka for maintenance of motive power and rolling&#13;
stock.&#13;
8.    Perumka's financial statements for 1991-95 are shown in Tables I and 2. An&#13;
analysis of key financial items indicates the following:&#13;
Traffic Trends. Perumka's traffic has been growing steadily, especially the passenger&#13;
traffic on Java (Annex 3.2). The passenger revenue share to total revenues increased&#13;
from 51% in 1991 to 62% in 1995.&#13;
Inflation Inflation was 7.5% in 1992, 9.2% in 1993, 9.6% in 1994 and 9.0% in 1995.&#13;
The cumulative effect was 35.3% from 1991 to 1995.&#13;
Revenues and Costs  The average passenger revenues per passenger-kilometer&#13;
increased by 43% from 1991 to 1995, with the increases for economy class services&#13;
being 26.5% and executive and business class services 60%. The average freight&#13;
revenues per ton-kilometer increased by 21.8% over the same period.&#13;
9.     Perumka's 1995 revenue and cost analysis indicates that although Perumka's overall&#13;
revenues are slightly higher than the operating costs, the revenues from economy class&#13;
passenger services cover only 20% to 75% of the corresponding costs, while the revenues for&#13;
executive and business class services cover some 150% to 240% of the associated costs.&#13;
Consequently, while the economy class passenger services represent some 77% of&#13;
Perumka's total passenger traffic in terms of passenger-kilometers, they generate only about&#13;
46% of the total passenger revenues. The executive and business class services, on the other&#13;
hand, represent only 23% of the total passenger traffic but generate 54% of the total&#13;
revenues. This indicates that the economy class tariffs are very low.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-119-&#13;
Annex 6.1&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
10.    With the exception of the Suralaya coal traffic and the fuel traffic to Solo, freight&#13;
trains usually fail to recover their operating costs which are grossly understated due to:&#13;
(i) reasons given in para. 7. and (ii) the depreciation is understated as it relates only to book&#13;
values. The average freight revenue covers 9% to 95% of the costs on various train runs.&#13;
11.    Perumka Staff. The total staff (permanent and contracted) has been reduced from&#13;
47,000 in 1988 to 41,446 in 1995. The wages and salaries, on the other hand, have increased&#13;
due to general as well as specific increases (e.g. special premiums to operating staff,&#13;
incentive award to higher productivity and extra emolument to maintenance personnel). As a&#13;
result, the overall staff cost nearly doubled from 1991 to 1995 and the labor cost share&#13;
increased from 31% of total operating costs in 1991 to 35% in 1995. While the staff costs&#13;
have been an extra burden on railway finances, the salary levels are only slightly higher than&#13;
the government salary scale and much lower than the private sector.&#13;
Financial Forecast&#13;
12.   The financial forecast incorporates the proposed investment plan, traffic growth,&#13;
tariff adjustments, inflation, policy reforms, and productivity improvements. Assumptions&#13;
underlying the financial forecast are described in the attachment 1. Income and funds flow&#13;
statements and balance sheets for the period of 1996 - 2002 are given in Tables 3, 4 and 5&#13;
13.   It is projected that the operating ratio, incorporating the revaluation of assets in 1998,&#13;
will improve from 97% in 1996 to 90% in 2002. The return on revalued net fixed assets will&#13;
improve from 2% to 5% for the same period. The internal cash generation will be sufficient&#13;
to cover interest and repayments and to contribute toward future investments.  The&#13;
Government's net out-flow of funds to Perumka will gradually decrease from a high of Rp.&#13;
95 billion in 1998 to Rp. 32 billion in 2000. From 2001, this net out-flow will change to a&#13;
net in-flow of Rp. 6 billion in 2001 and Rp. 55 billion in 2002 from Perumka. This indicates&#13;
that from 2001, the railway operations will become a source of funds to the Government&#13;
14.   The minimum self-financing ratio will be 27% in 1997 but thereafter will gradually&#13;
rise to 40% in 2002. The debt service coverage ratio will remain at the acceptable levels of&#13;
2.0 to 3.4 during 1997 to 2002. The balance sheet indicates that the current ratio, acid test&#13;
ratio and the debt/equity ratio would remain at safe levels.&#13;

passenger services were in effect in April 1996. These are equivalent to increases of 21% and&#13;
10.5%, respectively, over the twelve-month period.&#13;
C.     Loan Interests For the World Band loan on-lent to Perumka for its own portion of&#13;
the project cost, the forecast uses the same lending terms as that of the World Bank loan&#13;
(i.e. 7% interest for 20 years with five years of grace and commitment charges of 0.75%&#13;
p.a. on undisbursed balance of the loan).&#13;
For local loans, interest rates are 20% for 1996 and 1997, 15% for 1998 and 1999,&#13;

Notes: 1. As per Perumka, about Rp 687 billion have been spent during 1991-1995 for rolling stock, stations, etc,&#13;
which were funded from foreign loans and Perumka anticipates government paying this.&#13;
2. Although the subsidiary loan has been increased from US$19.4 million to US$19.8 million, the change has not been&#13;
taken into account due to very small amount.&#13;

            Indonesia - Railway Efficiency Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            With the general objective of improving
            the economic efficiency and service quality of
            Indonesia's railway sector, to position it to play its
            proper role within the transport system, the Railway
            Efficiency Project aims specifically at: a) railway
            subsector policy reform by restructuring the railway
            corporation, reforming its relationship with the government
            and creating the foundations for expanded private
            participation; b) rationalizing railway subsector capital
            investments; c) improving railway subsector management and
            operations; and d) increasing the physical capacity of an
            important railway corridor.  The project consists of five
            components: a) policy reform involving restructuring of
            Perumka into a persero and reform of government corporate
            interfaces; b) improvements to the railway between Jakarta
            and Bandung to expand capacity, shorten passenger journey
            time, and improve safety; c)implementation of a modern track
            maintenance system on Java; d) implementation of a diesel
            electric locomotive unit exchange maintenance system on
            Java; and e) strengthening of Permuka's management.
