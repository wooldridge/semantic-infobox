Port Privatization and Competition&#13;
in Colombia&#13;
J/u1a1 (aviria     Most of Colombia's general cargo trade has been handled by four public ports: Barranquilla,&#13;
Cartagena, and Santa Marta on the Atlantic coast and Buenaventura on the Pacific coast.' These&#13;
four ports were concessioned in 1993 to regional port "societies" established under company&#13;
law. These societies are responsible for contracting with port operators for the use of facilities&#13;
and supervising the facilities' use-they do not provide services directly. New laws abolished&#13;
restrictive labor practices and have allowed stevedoring services to compete freely at each port.&#13;
The liberalization of labor practices along with the privatization of port services has resulted in&#13;
large and rapid improvements in productivity, lower fees for port users, and very attractive&#13;
returns for the concessionaires. Productivity levels are higher than in most newly privatized ports&#13;
in other Latin American countries-where in many cases the ports have been privatized with&#13;
limited competition. The improvements have been realized with low initial investments, though&#13;
recently the port societies have gone beyond investing in shoreside equipment and are starting&#13;
to invest in infrastructure expansion.&#13;

            Port privatization and competition in Colombia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Most of Colombia's general cargo
            trade has been handled by four public ports: Barranquilla,
            Cartagena, and Santa Marta on the Atlantic coast and
            Buenaventura on the Pacific coast. These four ports were
            concessioned in 1993 to regional port "societies"
            established under company law. These societies are
            responsible for contracting with port operators for the use
            of facilities and supervising the facilities' use -
            they do not provide services directly. New laws abolished
            restrictive labor practices and have allowed stevedoring
            services to compete freely at each port. The liberalization
            of labor practices along with the privatization of port
            services has resulted in large and rapid improvements in
            productivity, lower fees for port users, and very attractive
            returns for the concessionaires. Productivity levels are
            higher than in most newly privatized ports in other Latin
            American countries - where in many cases the ports have been
            privatized with limited competition. The improvements have
            been realized with low initial investments, though recently
            the port societies have gone beyond investing in shoreside
            equipment and are starting to invest in infrastructure expansion.
