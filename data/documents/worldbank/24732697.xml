ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
This Collaboration Arrangement is er tered into on October 9, 2014 between:&#13;
(1)   DBS BANK LTD., representbd by its Chief Executive Officer and headquartered at 12 Me -i&#13;
Boulevard, Level 3, Marina Eay Financial Center Tower 3, Singapore 018982 ("DBS"); an :I&#13;
(2)   THE WORLD BANK GROU 3, comprising the INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR&#13;
RECONSTRUCTION AND DIEVELOPMENT ("IBRD") and INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPI 11I T&#13;
ASSOCIATION ("IDA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20433, U!  the&#13;
INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION, ("IFC") headquartered at 2121 Pennsylva ,i:&#13;
Avenue, NW, Washington, CC 20433, USA, and the MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT&#13;
GUARANTEE AGENCY, ("MIlGA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, D : 2 433,&#13;
USA (the "World Bank Group")&#13;
(each a "Party" and together, the "Parties").&#13;
Preamble&#13;
(A) There is broad international recognition, as confirmed by the G20, the OECD, Intein: )nal&#13;
Organizations (IOs), the G7'., and the private sector represented by the B20 that investir c i! the&#13;
infrastructure of Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is needed, to (x and&#13;
access to basic services an J raise living standards for all, and to meet global economit ;Ii wth&#13;
targets.&#13;
(B) Meeting this need present! a significant financing challenge. Given constraints on cx ting&#13;
sources of infrastructure finnce-particularly in the public sector-a redoubled and coc *r ited&#13;
effort is needed to mobilize F rivate sector finance for EMDE infrastructure.&#13;
(C) There is an absence of robist pipelines of structurally sound and bankable projects an-1 t s is&#13;
understood to be the greates t barrier to achieving significantly more infrastructure investrr -&#13;
(D) Governments, development inance institutions, donors, and private investors share an in :E 3t in&#13;
developing the market for p ivate infrastructure finance in EMDEs: both on the demand d 0, in&#13;
the numbers of structurally s und and bankable projects seeking finance, and gradual em 1 nce&#13;
of EMDE infrastructure as a recognized asset class; and the supply side, in the range c : jate&#13;
investors that actively participate in financing those projects. Achieving these goals wil :i iefit&#13;
from collective action betwe en this range of entities-to leverage resources and know e3:1; a to&#13;
find  solutions  to  complex  nfrastructure  financing  challenges  that no  single  institutic n  : )uld&#13;
achieve alone.&#13;
(E) In support of these goals, tho Parties propose the establishment of a Global Infrastructur( :i ility&#13;
Partnership Program ("GIF" . The GIF will be an open global platform aiming at leverali n; the&#13;
efforts of the wide range of nstitutions currently engaged in supporting EMDE infrastruc i -E with&#13;
the  participation  of private  infrastructure  investors, coalescing  around  project prel -n .ion,&#13;
structuring, and  risk mitigat on for individual infrastructure  investments. In this regard, 1:11E  GIF&#13;
aims to complement existing and proposed services and initiatives currently supporte&lt; b the&#13;
Parties and other prospectiv: GIF partners. The GIF intends to provide resources to prep 43 vell-&#13;
structured, infrastructure projects, and to serve as an additional mechanism for acces : ,i the&#13;
expertise of the Parties and other GIF partners, in combination with guidance from prc ; , tive&#13;
private sector financiers into project structures. The GIF thereby aims to achieve greater no age&#13;
of official resources in the fice of substantial EMDE infrastructure needs-in particular cr irge&#13;
and complex projects with tha potential to attract significant private capital.&#13;
(F) The  Parties are  now  intere:;ted  in collaborating  in developing the Global InfrastructurE  7; -ility&#13;
Partnership Program, togeth ar with other partners.&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;

they are of an indicative nature and will continue to be developed amongst the Parties and t!&#13;
other potential partners until tie GIF is formally established. The final version of these obje: i\ s&#13;
and principles will be agreed upon by the GIF Partners and be reflected in the agreement&#13;
establishing the GIF.&#13;
1.2   The Parties intend to work together with any additional participants who may be&#13;

Annex 1&#13;
Preliriinary GIF Foundational Principles&#13;
1     Objectives&#13;
1.1   The objective of the GIF is to promote private sector investment in infrastructure p' (J .ts&#13;
in emerging markets and de%eloping economies (EMDEs) through robust project preparat i&#13;
provision of appropriate risk mitigation instruments, and thereby increasing the commercie :H I&#13;
institutional investor engagerient in the EMDE infrastructure market. It is focused on&#13;
collaboration in complex pub ic-private partnerships and projects with potential for comme .E&#13;
viability which require project preparation resources, policy dialogue and eventual infrastri. c1 3&#13;
financing solutions that no single institution could achieve alone.&#13;
1.2   To this end, the GIF aims to create a global platform to provide financial and coon i u: ion&#13;
resources in collaboration wi-h the project preparation, advisory, and financing efforts of tl a v de&#13;
range of donor and development finance institutions currently engaged in supporting EMC&#13;
infrastructure, with the input and ideas of private infrastructure investors. GIF's engageme * c uld&#13;
stretch from upstream suppot on project definition, preparation, and investment feasibility&#13;
assessment, through to downstream transaction preparation, financial structuring, and ris&#13;
mitigation/credit enhanceme int.&#13;
1.3   Over the longer terrr, by contributing to the stock of high quality and well-structurEc&#13;
infrastructure projects, the G F can be expected to help in the development of EMDE&#13;
infrastructure as an asset class attractive to a wide range of private investors seeking lonc - e n&#13;
assets in faster growing ecor omies, but which until now have been presented only limited&#13;
infrastructure investment opr!ortunities that meet their risk tolerance and investment profil E.&#13;
2     Operating Principles&#13;
2.1   The GIF intends to cperate according to the following core principles, to be finaliz :I :on&#13;
agreement among GIF partn  rs:&#13;
(i) Leveraging the private sector-specializing in project financing modalities t it vill&#13;
draw together cc mparative advantages of public and private sectors;&#13;
(ii) Addressing public goods-focusing on core infrastructure; particularly thos:!&#13;
infrastructure projects that are climate friendly or trade enabling;&#13;
(iii) Promoting sustainability and inclusiveness-ensuring projects adhere to :E&#13;
practice standar is for social and environmental responsibility; and&#13;
(iv) Collaborating, #omplementing and partnering for solutions-mobilizng t .1; ical&#13;
and financial resources of all partner entities-World Bank Group entities, mL It 1 eral&#13;
development institutions, other public institutions, and private investors-in ai i&#13;
innovative and f exible way, to complement existing capacities, achieve great:!i&#13;
leverage and address the complex infrastructure financing challenges that arl&#13;
beyond the rescurces of any individual partner.&#13;
3     Institutional Arrangements and Governance&#13;
3.1   The GIF is expectec to involve a wide range of stakeholders who are involved in  a&#13;
development and implementation of infrastructure projects, both public and private. GIF pi) ti irs&#13;
are expected to fall into one or more of the following categories:&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(i) Funding Partner ;-Partners that provide financial contributions to the GIF wil bE&#13;
considered Fundi ig Partners.&#13;
(ii) Technical Partnurs-Partners that can and who will agree to provide specific&#13;
technical advice cnd support to GIF activities including execution of GIF-funde,&#13;
activities and/or provision of GIF-backed credit enhancement or liquidity sLppc t&#13;
instruments.&#13;
(iii) Advisory Partners-Private investors or entities that represent the voice of&#13;
commercial and/cr institutional investment, whether pension funds, insurance&#13;
companies, sove eign wealth funds, banks or other financial institutions, as wE 1 a&#13;
other multilateral or bilateral agencies engaged in supporting private sector&#13;
infrastructure pro ects, to be invited into discussions related to project preparal c n&#13;
optimal approaches to financial structuring, and the design and use of risk&#13;
instruments, with a view to ensure suitability of projects for commercial and/or&#13;
institutional investment.&#13;
3.2   A GIF Governing Ccuncil is proposed to oversee the GIF's strategic programminj&#13;
management and use of funcs, and development of operational policies and procedures; E nA&#13;
hold the GIF Management Ur it (see section 4.1) accountable for delivering on the facility's&#13;
objectives and principles, with advice and support from the Advisory Partners. The cornpo i ic of&#13;
the Governing Council will be agreed between IBRD and prospective partners, but is propi,s e: to&#13;
comprise representatives of Funding and Technical Partners.&#13;
3.3 An Advisory Counc I comprised of all GIF partners, chaired by the Managing Dirc t!o&#13;
and Chief Financial Officer oi the World Bank Group, will be periodically convened to facili : le&#13;
coordination of GIF activities and support GIF operations. This Advisory Council will serve a:&#13;
sounding board, providing gLidance and support for GIF Management, and in particular wJ&#13;
view to ensuring suitability of projects for private sector investment.&#13;
4     Management&#13;
4.1   The GIF will be adm nistered by the World Bank Group, through a small, dedicate: Ie Im&#13;
established for this purpose 'the GIF Management Unit). The GIF Management Unit will ft r c:n&#13;
as a coordinating body as pr)jects are identified for inclusion in the pipeline, and then mo' E&#13;
toward technical support anc financing phases. The GIF Management Unit will not lead in:1  ual&#13;
projects.&#13;
4.2   GIF activity implementation teams will be led by selected staff of Technical PartnEr&#13;
institutions, coordinated by the GIF Management Unit in consultation with client governmE r IE&#13;
according to specific project requirements and the project origination processes. Compoc it c of&#13;
the implementation teams rr ay vary according to the need of individual projects and govE ri ir ents.&#13;
5     Activities and Projects&#13;
5.1   Project selection c iteria and processes could be developed to reflect the follo tv r&#13;
principles:&#13;
(i) Development inpact-projects that support the development goals of the C F&#13;
partner institutic ns;&#13;
(ii) Alignment-projects that are aligned with recipient/sponsor country prioritie. ir I&#13;
strategies;&#13;
(iii) Complexity-p,ojects that require multiple parties to come together to provi( E&#13;
structuring, arranging and financial support, and/or projects which require a t 1r of&#13;
financial instruments; and&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(iv) Catalytic Impact-projects that have significant potential to achieve financial 1 a lity,&#13;
leverage public funds, and attract private sector and/or institutional investors- s. 1&#13;
as through Public -Private Partnership (PPP) modalities-while still meeting&#13;
government's sei vice delivery objectives.&#13;
The GIF will focus on infrastructure investments that have global public good characteristics : ich&#13;
as climate friendly-project, that are low emitting or encourage efficiency in the provisior (if&#13;
infrastructure services; and trade enabling-projects that facilitate or enhance interconne:t v /&#13;
and trade.&#13;
5.2   The scope of support provided to a particular project will be defined flexibly, with a 1w&#13;
to complementing the resources and support already available from partner entities and ot '1r&#13;
funding mechanisms. During :he GIF pilot phase, this support may include the following ac:i'i as,&#13;
corresponding to major project development stages:&#13;
(i) Project definition and enabling environment - sector planning and investment&#13;
prioritization; project definition, including needs analysis and pre-feasibility scr :or 1g;&#13;
and legal, regulatory, or institutional reforms;&#13;
(ii) Project preparation and investment feasibility - feasibility studies, investment&#13;
appraisal, and PPP structuring;&#13;
(iii) Transaction support and financial structuring - preparing and implementing&#13;
transactions, and design of risk mitigation/credit enhancement packages; and&#13;
(iv) Financial arranging and credit enhancement - arranging and mobilizing financi -&#13;
packages from a range of sources and partners.&#13;
6     Operational Policies&#13;
Sound operational policies-iicluding in particular the management of environmental and :nc 3l&#13;
impacts and risks, and transparency in procurement-are critical to the success of infrastri ic :t e&#13;
projects in supporting sustainable, inclusive development; as well as for investors in those&#13;
projects to manage financial, reputational and legal risks. In developing the appropriate&#13;
framework for GIF-supported operations, the GIF could draw upon existing arrangements 0 &#13;
external implementing entitie. under World Bank Partnership Programs. GIF partners will&#13;
collaborate to establish an approach to fiduciary, environmental and social safeguards anc (it Br&#13;
standards and policies, and cevelop, manage and oversee an accreditation process for Gl&#13;
Technical Partners who are expected to function as implementing entities for GIF activities&#13;
