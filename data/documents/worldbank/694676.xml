STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   The newly appointed Government of Romania faces a daunting economic and social&#13;
challenge. The gradualist approach to structural reform in the past several years and the lax&#13;
monetary and fiscal policies followed in the 1996 election year have precipitated an economic&#13;
crisis. The country is running a high current account deficit, high inflation, and faces huge fiscal&#13;
pressures. The Government has also inherited a large group of poor -- a major social problem --&#13;
the result of growing unemployment and large declines in real income in the early years of the&#13;
transition. The most vulnerable groups of poor reside mainly in rural areas and comprise the&#13;
unemployed, families with a large number of children, small farmers and particular groups of&#13;
pensioners. A common facet of poverty is the poor health and education status of low income&#13;
groups.&#13;
1.2   Long term sustained economic growth will require tight monetary and fiscal policies and&#13;
a stepped up pace of structural reforms. Especially necessary are an acceleration of privatization&#13;
in the industrial and agricultural sectors, liquidation of non-viable enterprises, liberalization of&#13;
agricultural prices, and imposition of hard budget constraints combined with sound financial&#13;
sector policies. Equally vital for sustained economic growth and the alleviation of poverty is the&#13;
development of a human capital base adapted to the emerging labor market needs of a&#13;
competitive market economy. This will require an acceleration of on-going reforms of&#13;
Romania's public education system that is likely to remain, for both efficiency and equity&#13;
reasons, an important provider and financier of pre-university education in the country.&#13;
1.3   Since 1990, Romania's Education Reform Program has focused mainly on the critical&#13;
issues of improving the quality, coverage, and cost-effectiveness of the pre-university school&#13;
system. The necessity of providing safe school infrastructure, essential for a well functioning&#13;
school system, has thus far largely been left unattended. The need to provide safe schools is&#13;
especially critical in Romania where a century of neglect and four major earthquakes have&#13;
created a stock of severely damaged and unsafe schools that pose a daily physical threat to school&#13;

- 2 -&#13;
occupants. The new Government, like its predecessors, is well aware of the need to rehabilitate&#13;
these severely damaged schools and has developed a two-phased school rehabilitation program.&#13;
The first phase of this strategy focuses on rehabilitating damaged schools in imminent danger of&#13;
collapse up to the national safety and pedagogic standards for pre-university schools established&#13;
by the Ministry of Education (MOE). Over the longer tern, the Government is commnitted to&#13;
upgrading all remaining damaged schools and constructing new schools, as needed, in&#13;
accordance with these norms.&#13;
1.4   The proposed School Rehabilitation Project would support the first phase of Government&#13;
school rehabilitation efforts by rehabilitating some 900 schools that are in imminent danger of&#13;
collapse. The main issues in school rehabilitation are detailed in section C of this chapter. A&#13;
discussion of the Government Rehabilitation Program and its support for the overall Education&#13;
Reform agenda is contained in Section D. A brief overview of the education sector, provided in&#13;
section B below, precedes this discussion. Basic statistics on the Romanian education system are&#13;
shown in Annex l.&#13;
B. THE EDUCATION SECTOR -- AN OVERVIEW&#13;
1.5   The Socialist Legacy. Under socialism, Romania achieved universal coverage in its pre-&#13;
university education system, comprising kindergarten (ages 6/7); primary (grades 1 to 4);&#13;
gymnasium (grades 5 to 8); and secondary school (grades 9 to 12/13). The secondary school&#13;
system was (and still remains) more diversified, comprising (a) four-year academic (general)&#13;
high schools; (b) technical high schools offering four-year day and five-year evening programs;&#13;
and (c) two- and three-year vocational schools attached to enterprises and vocational programs&#13;
attached to cooperatives. The system reported low drop-out and repetition rates and no gender&#13;
bias. Enrollment rates for girls were at par (basic education) or higher (secondary and tertiary)&#13;
than for boys.&#13;
1.6   Despite these achievements, the socialist objectives of the pre-transition Government&#13;
compromised the quality of education provided by the state. In the socialist era, education was&#13;
seen as a means of producing workers to meet the production goals of a command economy.&#13;
Curriculum and teaching approaches aimed at rote mastery of factual material, rather than&#13;
developing a student's cognitive and problem solving abilities. National examinations were used&#13;
primarily as a selection mechanism as opposed to a tool for assessing or certifying education and&#13;
training outcomes, monitoring school performance, ensuring accountability to the public, and&#13;
supporting educational change. Basic provision of textbooks and materials was outdated, with&#13;
year to year shortages, the result of the Government's reliance on an ineffective distribution&#13;
system and a state producer. Decision making in Romania's education system was highly&#13;
centralized, rather than reflective of school-based professionalism and flexibility in resource&#13;
management.&#13;
1.7   Consistent with their social planning objectives, pre-transition governments channeled&#13;
most students into vocational and technical education narrowly focused to meet the country's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
industrial needs. The proportion of secondary school students enrolled in technical or vocational&#13;
schools in Romania (96 percent) was the highest in the region. The Socialist governments also&#13;
restricted higher education to a privileged few. Students graduating from specialized vocational&#13;
and technical schools were channeled directly into the labor force. In 1990, only 6 percent of the&#13;
relevant age group, only half of the regional average, was enrolled in higher education programs.&#13;
Students enrolled in university education also faced a restrictive curriculum. The main emphasis&#13;
of higher education was on engineering, a program that enrolled almost two-thirds of all&#13;
students; academic research, social sciences and humanities were almost entirely neglected.&#13;
1.8   The share of resources allocated to education -- about 3 percent of GDP (Gross Domestic&#13;
Product) in 1990 -- was the lowest in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), and much lower than&#13;
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average of 6 percent of&#13;
GDP. The largest share of the education budget was spent on personnel, not surprising given the&#13;
small teaching loads, and high numbers, of single subject teachers. The proportion of total&#13;
education expenditures allocated to capital expenditures (5 percent) was amongst the lowest in&#13;
the region and well below OECD norms. One major problem ensuing from inadequate&#13;
investment in capital structure and reduced real resources is that the Romanian school&#13;
infrastructure is antiquated and considerably depreciated. Four severe earthquakes over the&#13;
course of the last century have left many buildings, constructed with outdated earthquake&#13;
standards, and built with traditional building materials, in imminent danger of collapse.&#13;
1.9   Recent Developments: The Impact of the Transition.. The economic and social&#13;
developments over the transition exposed the poor quality and structural weaknesses of the&#13;
socialist education system and created a dynamic process in the provision and demand for&#13;
education in Romania. Two early reforms of the education system -- the freedom of school&#13;
choice and the removal of restrictions on private entry in the education sector -- provided further&#13;
impetus for this change. As a result, in 1994, in marked contrast to the nearly universal coverage&#13;
of pre-transition times, gross enrollments declined to 94 percent in basic education, and remained&#13;
only 60 percent in secondary school. The bulk of secondary school leavers were students of&#13;
vocational and technical schools with curriculums that became largely irrelevant to emerging&#13;
labor market needs. Enrollments in general secondary schools, offering a more balanced&#13;
curriculum, actually increased to nearly 20 percent of total secondary school enrollment.&#13;
Dropouts were largely concentrated among children from poor families, hit hardest by real&#13;
declines in income, and least able to bear the rising direct and indirect costs of schooling.&#13;
1.10 Emerging unemployment and poverty among secondary school leavers, and increasing&#13;
private sector wage premiums for college educated workers induced students to pursue higher&#13;
education. Enrollments in colleges and universities increased phenomenally, particularly among&#13;
the better off segments of society that were able to afford the fees charged by private colleges&#13;
and universities. Private sector growth in the education sector surpassed all countries in the&#13;
region. In 1995, nearly 85,300 students (almost 25 percent of all tertiary students) attended 36&#13;
private higher education institutions. Private sector entry into pre-university education has been&#13;
more limited. Although private secondary schools have been established, they enroll only a&#13;
negligible share (0.1 percent) of secondary school age children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
1.11   Changing student needs and the rigidities in down-sizing and re-allocating staff to meet&#13;
emerging student demand, led to an increase in the number of total staff in the pre-university&#13;
education program. Student-to-teacher ratios declined at all levels of education to well below&#13;
OECD norms. Although real education spending declined by only 4 percent, the share of&#13;
personnel expenditures in the total education budget, already high by regional standards&#13;
increased further -- at the expense of capital and other essential expenditure -- to over three-&#13;
quarters of the total education budget. In 1994, the overall spending on basic education was pro-&#13;
poor, but spending on secondary and, particularly, tertiary education was more biased towards&#13;
higher income groups. There was also an urban bias to education expenditures. Per capita&#13;
spending on education in rural areas was lower than for urban centers.2&#13;
C. THE SCHOOL REHABILITATION PROGRAM -- KEY ISSUES&#13;
1.12  In 1994, faced with these realities, Romania embarked on a reform of its pre-university&#13;
education system. The main objective of the Education Reform Program, supported by the&#13;
World Bank financed Education Reform Project 3, is to improve the quality and coverage of the&#13;
pre-university education system. Reform efforts have mainly focused on updating the&#13;
curriculum, and improving the quality of management and staff. The necessity of improving the&#13;
quality of the school infrastructure, to ensure the safety of students and teachers, and to support&#13;
the pedagogic changes envisaged by the education refonn program, has so far largely been left&#13;
unattended. The potential risks of delaying rehabilitation efforts further are enormous. Nearly&#13;
200,000 students are daily exposed to physical risk in some 900 severely damaged and&#13;
dilapidated schools. The key issues facing the implementation of the Government's school&#13;
rehabilitation efforts, the focus of the proposed School Rehabilitation Project, are outlined&#13;
below:&#13;
1.13  Aging and Poorly Built School Infrastructure. At the beginning of the 1995/1996&#13;
academic year, the basic education system in Romanian educational network (private and public)&#13;
at all levels included 29,536 units: 12,772 kindergartens; 13,817 primary and gymnasia schools,&#13;
of which 6,180 offer only grades 1-4 ; 2,684 academic secondary and technical schools; 168&#13;
special schools for handicapped children; and 95 higher education institutions. The entire&#13;
educational physical plant included about 121,300 classrooms, 19,300 laboratories, 4,608&#13;
gymnastic rooms, and 10,590 workshops. The majority, or 82 percent of the schools, are located&#13;
in rural areas, but urban schools account for about 40 percent of all classrooms and laboratories&#13;
and 66 percent of all workshops. Most of the school facilities are dated and outmoded: about 12&#13;
percent were built in the last century; 27 percent were built between 1901-1945; 43 percent&#13;
between 1946-1970; 16 percent between 1971-1989. Less than one percent were built from 1990&#13;
to the present. Many facilities used as schools were not designed for educational use and do not&#13;
meet generally accepted norms for school facilities: teaching spaces appropriate for the subjects&#13;
2     Romania: Poverty and Social Policy (1997). Report 14642- RO&#13;
Loan RO-3724-RO for US$50 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
taught; optimum space utilization and unit areas per student place; basic sanitation and comfort; and&#13;
safety (building fire protection/escapes, seismic reinforcement). Nearly 76 percent of all rural&#13;
schools have no water or sanitation facilities, some have no electricity at all. Most schools are ill-&#13;
equipped. Classroom furniture is generally adequate/appropriate for only half of the students in&#13;
schools with two or more shifts (students in lower grades (1-4) are enrolled in morning shifts while&#13;
older students (grades 5-8) occupy the same classrooms in the afternoon shifts). The MOE has&#13;
established basic school facilities norms, but their application to school buildings has been limited&#13;
by three key factors: (a) the chronic shortage of funds that has only permitted very basic repairs to&#13;
school infrastructure; (b) until 1991 and after 1995, the local responsibility for school construction&#13;
and repair; and (c) the limited MOE supervision of school rehabilitation efforts (discussed below).&#13;
1.14  Insufficient Investments in School Infrastructure. The Govermnent initiated a large&#13;
program of investment in school infrastructure during the Ceaucescu era, but a shortage of funds&#13;
has left the program in disarray. Since 1980, there had been no new significant investments in&#13;
new infrastructure, and construction of many school buildings started at that time remain&#13;
incomplete. The school infrastructure investment program was revived in 1990, but even with&#13;
2,000 new classrooms built since then, the backlog in the demand for new student places has not&#13;
been met. The rehabilitation and upgrading of the aging physical plant has barely scratched the&#13;
extent of the need. In 1995, the Government increased the school investment budget to 5 billion&#13;
Lei (about US$2.5 million), or 0.2 percent of the pre-university school budget (from 0.1 percent&#13;
of this budget in previous years). In 1996, the share of investment in the total pre-university&#13;
school budget was maintained at 1995 levels. Over 50 percent of the 1996 capital budget was&#13;
used to continue works started in 1995, and nearly 30 percent was devoted to the rehabilitation of&#13;
damaged school buildings; the remainder was spent on replacing furniture and equipment in&#13;
schools and preparing and planning for new work. Since 1995, the MOE has embarked on the&#13;
rehabilitation of some 600 of the most damaged schools in Romania. Nearly 200 schools have&#13;
been completely upgraded (although not necessarily to meet the pedagogic standards of the&#13;
Education Reform Program) and the rehabilitation of another 400 schools is near completion.&#13;
1.15  Limited Funds for Maintenance of School Buildings. Annual expenditures for school&#13;
maintenance are covered by the budgets of local governments. Lump sum amounts are allocated&#13;
by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) from the State Budget to cover part of the expenditures&#13;
financed by local governments, including those for school maintenance. In theory, the funds&#13;
from the State Budget are allocated to districts based on the following algorithm: maintenance&#13;
resources to each district equal 1.5 percent of the value of all new school buildings and 5 percent&#13;
of the value of all older schools. The values of older school buildings are updated by applying&#13;
the price adjustment coefficients determined by MOF. In practice, maintenance funds are&#13;
allocated on the basis of student enrollment in each school, but the MOF has provided far less&#13;
than the stipulated amount for the maintenance of schools. The inadequacy of the central&#13;
Government allocations are further compromised at the local level. School maintenance funds&#13;
are not always used by localities for the purposes for which they are intended. District and local&#13;
Government have been known to appropriate these funds for other more pressing district or local&#13;
concerns. The actual availability of funds for maintaining schools has therefore been largely ad&#13;
hoc, presenting potentially greater problems for poorer districts, less able to lobby for funds, or&#13;
raise their own resources to maintain school infrastructure. The degree of deterioration of school&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
facilities is now so severe that many school buildings qualify for major rehabilitation works. The&#13;
current funding levels barely cover the costs of simple, routine maintenance, which is no longer&#13;
adequate to restore school buildings to minimal safety standards, often cosmetic, and masks&#13;
serious structural damage.&#13;
1.16   High Physical Risk to School Occupants. The age and extensive deterioration of many&#13;
school facilities due to the poor building standards and inadequate maintenance have raised&#13;
anxiety about the safety to school occupants should another earthquake of major magnitude hit&#13;
the country. The strong tremors that struck Romania in 1977 (7.2 Richter) collapsed 32 major&#13;
buildings in Bucharest alone and damaged numerous schools in the affected areas. Major&#13;
earthquakes in 1986, and again in 1990, aggravated an already serious situation and fueled public&#13;
concern about building safety, particularly of schools. In 1995, the MOE undertook facility&#13;
surveys covering around 12,000 schools. The surveys, validated by the Ministry of Public&#13;
Works and Territorial Planning (MPWTP) revealed serious structural damage in some 1,150&#13;
schools which accommodate around 315,000 students and 22,000 teachers. These schools were&#13;
assessed with a damage factor of 0.60 or less, a level of deterioration which could cause the&#13;
buildings to collapse without warning. Of the 1 ,150 schools, 170 were declared as totally unsafe.&#13;
These buildings have been condemned and necessitate complete replacement. The students have&#13;
been transferred to other available facilities or to neighboring schools. About 600 of these&#13;
damaged schools have since been structurally reinforced (about 200 have been completed, the&#13;
rest are currently undergoing repairs). From additional surveys conducted in 1996 by the MOE&#13;
and MPWTP, 420 other schools have emerged as having an equally serious degree of structural&#13;
damage. Thus, there remain about 900 schools that require immediate attention and&#13;
rehabilitation. Nearly 80 percent of these buildings are in rural areas and enroll almost 41&#13;
percent of the 200,000 affected students.&#13;
1.17   Overcrowding and Reduced Learning Time. The lack of investment in infrastructure to&#13;
meet demographic trends and address poor building standards has created over-crowded&#13;
conditions in public schools. Many of the classrooms in the damaged schools, especially in urban&#13;
areas,5 are under-sized and accommodate more than the regular number of students. About 16&#13;
percent of the damaged urban schools (for which data is available) are operating with three or&#13;
more shifts. The "class hour" in these schools has been reduced to only 30-35 minutes, much&#13;
lower than the regular 45 minutes of instruction in single- and two-shift schools. As a result of&#13;
the closure of part or all of the school, students of many damaged schools have been displaced&#13;
either to facilities not intended for classroom use or to adjacent schools. The displacement of&#13;
students to adjacent schools has in turn exacerbated the classroom situation in the host school&#13;
and disturbed the learning environment for all the students. The MOE reports that, in some&#13;
cases, the damage to school buildings has led to the closure of schools in remote rural areas&#13;
4      The degree of seriousness of the damage to a building is based on the ratio of the assessed seismic&#13;
resistance of the building in its present state to the minimum seismic resistance mandated by the National Building&#13;
Code. A factor of 0.60 or less classifies the building under the emergency category, and requires that the building be&#13;
strengthened no later than 5 years. A factor of 0.30 or less requires that the building be strengthened within two&#13;
years of the technical assessment&#13;
5      On the average, an urban classroom accommodates 52 students compared to 19 in rural schools.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
forcing students to travel greater distances to attend neighboring schools. Other rural&#13;
communities faced with this situation, have rented schools in farm houses, while in some villages&#13;
children have been deprived of education altogether.&#13;
1.18  Inefficient Allocation of Investment Funds. Scarce capital funds for school construction&#13;
and/or repair are allocated inefficiently with little judicious/strategic planning. Allocation&#13;
criteria among the Judets and the system of ordering priorities has much room for improvement.&#13;
Because design norms are not applied consistently, the scope of school construction contracts&#13;
become too broad and open-ended, resulting in vicious cycle of contract price adjustments,&#13;
completion delays and escalating costs. This inefficiency reduces the amounts potentially&#13;
available to repair other schools or to construct new or expanded schools to accommodate&#13;
student needs. The absence of basic information, such as a comprehensive school map, hinders&#13;
the capacity of the MOE to save resources by consolidating under-utilized schools in the same&#13;
catchment area.&#13;
1.19  Weak Management of the School Construction Program. The rehabilitation and&#13;
construction of schools is the responsibility of District Education Inspectorates which award the&#13;
contracts through a competitive process. The MOE is appropriately removed from implementation.&#13;
Its role is to allocate investment funds to the Judets, set the standards by which these funds are&#13;
used, and monitor the use of the resources. The MOE General Directorate for Technical&#13;
Investment Coordination (GDTIC) is ill equipped and staffed to perform this task. With its six&#13;
existing staff, GDTIC lacks the capacity and management skills to plan, regulate and oversee a&#13;
large new educational infrastructure program in addition to its current workload. The regulatory&#13;
capacity of the GDTIC unit is already over-extended because it oversees (i) the construction and&#13;
furnishing of school buildings left uncompleted by the Ceaucescu regime; (ii) keeps track of the&#13;
regular repairs of school buildings, and the construction activities on higher education&#13;
institutions funded from the MOE capital budget, which are ongoing in all 41 Judets. The low&#13;
pay scales and poor working conditions in the public sector make it difficult for the GDTIC to&#13;
attract skilled professionals to augment its management and/or staff.&#13;
D. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY AND BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.20  The Education Reform Strategy. The new Government of Romania is committed to&#13;
accelerating the pace of education sector reforms in Romania, and has placed the development.&#13;
of an adequate human capital base as a cornerstone of its Development 2000 agenda. The&#13;
ultimate objective of the Government's education sector reform plan is to improve the quality&#13;
(including the safety) and coverage of its education system to OECD standards, and to ensure&#13;
that scarce resources available to the education sector are allocated efficiently to address pressing&#13;
sectoral needs. Considerable progress has already been made toward achieving this objective.&#13;
1.21   Romania moved towards achieving better quality and efficiency in its education system as&#13;
early as 1990. Early reforms removed restrictions on school choice and allowed private sector&#13;
entry into the education system. In 1993, the Government issued a white paper on education,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
supported by the conclusions of the Bank's first sector review of the Human Resources Sector in&#13;
Romania, that had at its core: (a) a re-orientation of education to lifelong learning; (b) the updating&#13;
of the content of education and approach to teaching based on knowledge of cognitive sciences; (c)&#13;
the reorganization of both pre- and in-service teacher education to increase teacher's understanding&#13;
of teaching and learning; (d) a restructuring of technical and vocational education to consolidate&#13;
and provide a common core of general training in all secondary schools; (e) the abolition of the&#13;
state monopoly of textbooks, (f) the decentralization of the coordination and administration of the&#13;
education system to regional Inspectorates and schools; (g) structural change in higher education&#13;
that diversifies the types of post-secondary programs offered, reduces emphasis on early&#13;
specialization and promotes research; (h) accreditation methods for private and public education;&#13;
and (i) an increase in the resource base for education to improve teaching conditions and raise the&#13;
level of investment and operating expenditures for buildings and education materials, in line with&#13;
regional norms.&#13;
1.22  In 1994, with World Bank support, Romania embarked on a reform of its pre-university&#13;
education program that was consistent with the objectives of the reform strategy outlined above.&#13;
The Education Reform Project focuses on:7 curriculum reform; teacher in-service and pre-service&#13;
training; the introduction of learning assessment mechanisms; and the de-regulation and&#13;
increased competitiveness of the textbook supply process. The increased relevance of the&#13;
curriculum to labor market needs, in conjunction with social scholarship programs to the poor,&#13;
was expected to redress the declining coverage of recent years. An equally important objective&#13;
of the project is to strengthen the managerial and financial efficiency of the system in order that&#13;
scarce budgetary resources are allocated cost effectively across competing intra-sectoral needs.&#13;
1.23  Romania's education reform strategy was incorporated in the landmark (a) 1995 Education&#13;
Law that reforms the structure, content and requirements of compulsory education, rationalizes&#13;
school entrance/leaving examinations, strengthens the management authority of school&#13;
headmasters, strengthens in-service teacher training programs, allows cost recovery by higher&#13;
education institutions, and (b) the Law on Local Administration which devolves authority to the&#13;
districts for revenue generation and management of public services, including education. In&#13;
response to the resource problems of the education sector, the Government also has raised&#13;
education spending to 4 percent of GDP.&#13;
1.24  The policy framework provided by these laws gave impetus to the development of a&#13;
Bank-assisted Reform of Higher Education and Research Project 8, effective since December&#13;
1996, that supports the improvement of the management capacity of higher education institutions&#13;
and the development of undergraduate and postgraduate research programs.9 The coming into&#13;
force of these Laws also facilitated the implementation of the pre-university Education Reform&#13;
Program. Progress has been made on several key fronts. The curriculum for basic education has&#13;

been revised, the textbook monopoly has been abolished, and the entry of private textbook&#13;
suppliers into the public school textbook procurement process well secured. Learning&#13;
assessment tools are being developed, the remaining curriculum is under revision, the financial&#13;
and management capacity of the MOE is being strengthened, and the re-organization of teacher&#13;
pre- and in-service training should soon be underway. The Government has also slowly started&#13;
to convert under-utilized technical and vocational schools to a more general education system, a&#13;
process supported by EU/PHARE.&#13;
1.25  The School Rehabilitation Strategy. The rehabilitation of pre-university schools to the&#13;
safety and pedagogic norms established by the Education Reform Program has been slow. In&#13;
response to public outcry about the lack of safety in public schools and agitation about&#13;
impending earthquakes, the Government enacted Decrees HGR 644/1990 and OGR 20/1994&#13;
mandating that citizens and institutions ensure the safety of their respective physical facilities. In&#13;
1995, the Government also centralized school rehabilitation efforts, previously the purview of&#13;
local authorities, in the MOE, to ensure compliance with national safety standards and building&#13;
codes, and outlined its School Infrastructure Program. This program includes: (a) the completion&#13;
of unfinished construction started during the Ceaucescu regime; (b) an annual investment target&#13;
of 400 new classrooms to reduce overcrowding, accommodate demographic shifts, and provide&#13;
schools in under-served areas; (c) upgrading deteriorated infrastructure; and (d)&#13;
equipping/furnishing schools.&#13;
1.26  The new Government faces a major task in accomplishing these goals, particularly as&#13;
funds for school rehabilitation efforts are extremely limited. Its School Infrastructure Program is&#13;
a two-prong strategy of rehabilitation and new investments in school facilities. School&#13;
Rehabilitation will be implemented in two phases. In the first phase, the Government will focus&#13;
on upgrading and strengthening the schools that pose the greatest risk to the life of school&#13;
occupants. The second phase will strengthen and repair the remaining schools, and upgrade or&#13;
expand existing schools to reduce school crowding. Priorities for new investments in pre-&#13;
university facilities are the provision of schools in under-served areas. Schools in both facets of&#13;
the School Infrastructure Program will be rehabilitated or constructed in accordance with the&#13;
safety and building standards for the pre-university education system established by the MOE&#13;
and adapted under this project.&#13;
1.27 The Government has requested urgent support from the World Bank and the Council of&#13;
Europe Social Development Fund (CESDF) to complete the first phase of its school&#13;
rehabilitation efforts. The proposed School Rehabilitation Project responds to this request by&#13;
supporting the rehabilitation of 900 of the most seriously damaged schools in Romania to the&#13;
safety and pedagogic norms established under the Education Reform Program. The proposed&#13;
project has considerable merit as it would: (a) eliminate the physical risk to occupants of&#13;
damaged schools; (b) improve the learning environment in affected schools, with a beneficial&#13;
impact on student achievement and learning; (c) improve the education status in rural areas and&#13;
contribute to alleviating poverty; (d) reduce fiscal costs by increasing the capacity of the&#13;
Government to plan and execute school building and rehabilitation programs efficiently using&#13;
economic principles and established building norms; and (e) galvanize and attract donor funds to&#13;
pressing school construction and rehabilitation needs. Finally, by complementing the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
Government's overall Education Reform Program, the project would help improve the quality&#13;
and coverage of education in Romania and contribute to the development of a skilled human&#13;
capital base essential for sustained economic growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.1   The broad objective of the proposed project is to support and sustain the Government's&#13;
Education Reform Program as outlined in the preceding Chapter and described in greater detail in&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) of the Education Reform Project.10 Specifically, the project supports&#13;
the Government's efforts to rehabilitate schools up to the safety standards and pedagogic norms&#13;
established by MOE in accordance with the Education Reform Prograrn. The objectives of the&#13;
project are to:&#13;
(a)   rehabilitate, upgrade and furnish pre-university schools, thereby restoring safety&#13;
of school buildings in imminent danger of collapse, and mitigating the educational&#13;
disadvantages to students occupying such schools; and&#13;
(b)   improve MOE's institutional capacity at the national and district levels to plan,&#13;
develop and maintain the public educational physical plant.&#13;
2.2   The two main components of the project, School Rehabilitation and Institutional Capacity&#13;
Improvement, are directly linked to these objectives, and will be implemented over a five year&#13;
period (1998-2002). A detailed description of these components is provided in Section B.&#13;
Section C provides the economic justification for this project&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.3   Prpject Content. The two main components of the project are:&#13;
Component 1: School Rehabilitation. (US$103.3 million base cost) This component&#13;
consists of the rehabilitation, upgrading, and furnishing of about 900 schools&#13;
(kindergarten, primary and secondary) in 41 districts. The extent or scope of the&#13;
rehabilitation for each school would be determined in accordance with the school design&#13;
and planning standards described in Annex 2 and the economic concepts and methods in&#13;
Annexes 3A and 3B. The prioritization of schools for rehabilitation would be established&#13;
in accordance with the school mapping models developed for the pilot districts of Tulcea&#13;
and Vaslui and the agreed economic criteria and methodology described in Annex 4.&#13;
10   SARNo. 11931-RO. March 16,1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12-&#13;
Component 2: Institutional Capacity Improvement. (US$3.3 million base cost). This&#13;
component consists of strengthening the sectoral capacity of the MOE, at both national&#13;
and Judet levels, to: (i) plan, implement and manage the Government's school investment&#13;
and rehabilitation program; and (ii) to manage and maintain the public educational&#13;
physical plant. This component has two elements:&#13;
(i)    School Facilities Planning and Maintenance. This sub-component consists of&#13;
developing/improving the skills of MOE and District Inspectorate staff to use cost-&#13;
effective methods and national building standards in: (a) the development of new&#13;
educational facilities; (b) rehabilitating and upgrading existing physical infrastructure;&#13;
and, (c) managing the school maintenance program.&#13;
(ii)   Project Administration. The project would provide the necessary resources to the&#13;
Central Project Management Unit (CPCU) and to the District Project Implementing Units&#13;
(DPIU) to implement the project efficiently.&#13;
Detailed Project Description&#13;
2.4   School Rehabilitation. This section describes the key elements of the school&#13;
rehabilitation program that include: (a) the selection of project schools; (b) the scope of&#13;
rehabilitation efforts; (c) the sequencing of schools for rehabilitation; and (d) the building&#13;
standards used for rehabilitating schools.&#13;
2.5   Pr£J.ect selection. The proposed project will rehabilitate, upgrade and furnish about 900&#13;
seriously damaged pre-university schools nationwide. The schools were selected on the basis of&#13;
facility surveys conducted by the MOE and MPWTP in 1995 and 1996, to identify those with&#13;
seriously damaged buildings which are likely to collapse without warning and cause fatalities.&#13;
(para 1.16) The structural resistance of these buildings were found during the surveys, to be&#13;
under the threshold considered able to resist an earthquake of a given magnitude, as specified in&#13;
the latest (1996) edition of the National Building Code of Romania. Nearly 170 of these&#13;
damaged facilities have been condemned and need to be completely replaced with new&#13;
construction. The selected facilities include about 100 kindergarten, 700 primary and 100&#13;
general secondary schools, which altogether accommodate about 200,000 students. Nearly 80&#13;
percent of these schools are in rural areas and enroll almost 41 percent of the affected students.&#13;
2.6   Project scope. The exact scope of school rehabilitation efforts (upgrading, expansion,&#13;
consolidation, etc.) would be decided on the basis of a comparison of the net present value&#13;
(NPV) of several possible rehabilitation possibilities relative to a base case scenario (do nothing&#13;
now and replace the school when the building collapses). The chosen option would have the&#13;
highest NPV among all considered. The menu of available options include: (a) for an isolated&#13;
school: (i) strengthening, or depending on the technical considerations, completely rebuilding the&#13;
damaged school; (ii) expansion of the damaged school to relieve overcrowding; I Iand (b) for&#13;
The positive impact of reasonably adequate physical facilities on learning outcomes is well documented&#13;
world-wide, although rarely is investment in physical space the single most effective investment for increasing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
schools with similar schools in the same catchment area: in addition to (i) and (ii) above, a&#13;
consideration of: (iii) the closure of the damaged school as a result of consolidation with&#13;
expanded (if needed) adjacent schools; or (iv) the consolidation of area schools with the&#13;
rehabilitated and expanded (if needed) damaged school. The NPV calculations provide the net&#13;
financial savings in terms of recurrent and capital cost realized by investing in rehabilitating the&#13;
school now relative to later when the school is more damaged or collapsed. A detailed&#13;
description of this method is provided in Annexes 3A and 3B.&#13;
2.7    Project sequencing. The project will need to prioritize rehabilitation efforts for two&#13;
reasons: (a) the possibility that particular school buildings may collapse over the lifetime of the&#13;
project and result in a loss of student/teacher lives; and (b) resources allocated for the&#13;
rehabilitation for all the 900 schools may fall short of actual requirements. School rehabilitation&#13;
efforts will be prioritized in two stages. In the first stage, all schools will be ranked, in ascending&#13;
order, by the benefit-cost ratio of rehabilitating each school. The benefits of the project are to&#13;
improve the quality of education in accordance with the pedagogic and safety norms for pre-&#13;
university education established by the MOE. For sequencing purposes, the benefit will be&#13;
approximated by the major benefit of rehabilitating each school: averting the potential loss of life&#13;
of students. The cost is simply an approximate cost of rehabilitating each school. Assuming the&#13;
value of each student life is identical for all students, schools can be ranked simply by the&#13;
benefit-cost ratio, approximated by the total number (expected value) of lives saved per school&#13;
rehabilitation cost, avoiding the issue of assigning a precise value to each life saved. A higher&#13;
social value of rural lives, implied by the Government's own ranking method, can also be&#13;
accommodated in the method outlined above by assigning a relatively higher multiple (of 10%)&#13;
in the calculation of project benefit to rural schools.  (See Annex 4 and Annex 2 for details of&#13;
estimating the benefits and costs of rehabilitating each school, respectively). This phase of&#13;
sequencing provides the theoretical basis or benchmark for prioritizing schools for rehabilitation.&#13;
2.8    The second stage of sequencing will prioritize schools for rehabilitation within each&#13;
district (over time) and across districts (in any given year), taking into account more practical&#13;
concerns. In this second stage, the first step will be the development of attractive bidding&#13;
packages of schools for rehabilitation. The composition of schools in each bidding package will&#13;
take into account the geographic proximity, new/old, and urban/rural mix of schools. The next&#13;
step will be the prioritization of packages over the project cycle in each district. This will be&#13;
based on the benefit-cost ratio of each bidding package of schools to be rehabilitated in each&#13;
district according to the sequencing methodology described above. The last step will be the&#13;
learning achievement. The parallel Education Reform Project (Loan 3724-RO) currently under implementation,&#13;
focuses on other learning inputs such as curriculum, textbooks and teacher improvements.&#13;
12     Ideally, project sequencing would be undertaken after, or simultaneously with, the decision on project&#13;
scope. But for simplicity and because of data unavailability, it is necessary to use a rough approximation of the&#13;
rehabilitation cost of each school to sequence schools before project scope is decided. In addition, project scope&#13;
decisions are only based on fiscal savings and do not include benefits of lives saved because: (i) the lives saved by&#13;
each option would be the same under all options and would therefore not distort choice among options; (ii) this&#13;
avoids the difficulty of valuing lives; and (iii) initial results from pilot districts indicate that investment in schools&#13;
yields an IRR that is at least 47 percent on the basis of fiscal savings alone.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
determination of the number of packages to be bid in each district in each year of the project&#13;
according to the construction and project administration capacity of the district. Once the&#13;
bidding packages have been selected for each year for each district, they can also be prioritized&#13;
across districts in any given year, by the benefit cost ratio of the total bidding package of schools&#13;
to be rehabilitated in each district (See Annex 4 for details).&#13;
2.9   Building Standards. The project will rehabilitate the damaged buildings in confornity&#13;
with the structural requirements of the National Building Code (see para 2.5). Consistent with&#13;
the objectives of the Education Reform Program, the intervention in each project school will also&#13;
address educational quality considerations. Each school would be upgraded, as necessary, to&#13;
meet the minimum standards for pre-university school facilities established by the MOE. These&#13;
school design norms take into account: student capacity; the number of shifts; and type of&#13;
accommodation (i.e. adequate number and sizes of classrooms, laboratories, teacher and&#13;
administrative spaces, etc.). The MOE has also established standards for the provision of basic&#13;
necessities, such as sanitation, water, electricity, heating, safety, and environmental protection&#13;
which have been incorporated in the design norms. In particular, the design norms prohibit the&#13;
use of asbestos in school buildings. Implementation procedures, described in detail in the Project&#13;
Implementation Plan (PIP), also provide for the appropriate removal and disposal of asbestos&#13;
materials in rehabilitating the damaged buildings. The scope of work under the project will be&#13;
subject to the following conditions:&#13;
(a)   the scope of work will exclude the rehabilitation of student boarding places&#13;
(dormitories) and vocational workshops;&#13;
(b)   only essential utilities will be provided (i.e. fire escapes, toilets/sanitation, water&#13;
and heating). In those cases where schools operate in more than two shifts,&#13;
additional classrooms and essential teaching spaces will be provided such that the&#13;
school enrollment can be accommodated in two shifts in classroom capacities&#13;
mandated by the Education Law (i.e. 25-30 pupils per classroom);&#13;
(c)   all schools will be provided with basic furniture (student and teacher desks) in&#13;
quantities sufficient to seat all students in the classrooms and laboratories (In&#13;
some cases, this could mean supplying all the furniture to schools which have&#13;
none or no serviceable units. An inventory of furniture in all schools will be&#13;
conducted during project implementation to determine the appropriate&#13;
quantities/types to be provided to each facility). However, given that the pre-&#13;
university curriculum is still under revision (para 1.24), and that the appropriate&#13;
standards for teaching equipment remain to be defined and approved for national&#13;
application, the project will not finance the procurement of teaching equipment&#13;
(e.g. laboratory, audio-visual, computers, etc.); and&#13;
(d)   the project will not finance the rehabilitation of schools in which structural repairs&#13;
have already been completed/started by the MOE (see para 1. 16).&#13;
2.10   The project will finance civil works/building construction, basic school furniture, and&#13;
professional architectural and engineering services to complete detailed technical surveys, school&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15-&#13;
mapping, and the preparation of detailed building plans, specifications and bidding documents.&#13;
The detailed cost breakdown of this component is shown in Annex 5. Table1. Implementation&#13;
and procurement arrangements are summarized in Chapter 3 and described in detail in the PIP.&#13;
2.11  During Negotiations, the Government provided assurances that it would: (a) follow the&#13;
criteria and procedures, and the design standards agreed withi the Bank, witli respect to: (i) the&#13;
rehabilitation, upgrading andfurnishing of the schools under the project; and (ii) the&#13;
prioritization of thte rehabilitation of such schools; and (b) submit to the Bank, for its&#13;
approval, any proposed modifications to said criteria, procedures and standards before such&#13;
modifications are introduced.&#13;
2.12  School Facilities Planning and Maintenance. The project would strengthen capacity at&#13;
the national and local levels to plan, implement, and manage a cost-effective and sustainable&#13;
educational infrastructure development program, and maintain the physical plant. The target&#13;
beneficiaries of this component are: at the national level, the MOE General Directorate for&#13;
Technical Investment Coordination and the MOE Office of Information Systems (OIS); and, at&#13;
the local level, the District Education Inspectorates. Specifically, the capacities of relevant&#13;
MOE and Inspectorate staff would be strengthened in the following areas:&#13;
(a)   School location planning. Staff of the GDTIC and the OIS would be trained in&#13;
the preparation and analysis of detailed school maps in order to develop their&#13;
proficiency in the use of the methodology developed during the survey of&#13;
damaged schools in the pilot districts (Tulcea and Vaslui) during project&#13;
preparation. This activity would be organized with the assistance of a school&#13;
mapping expert, and would be implemented through in-country workshops in&#13;
conjunction with the capacity building interventions under the Bank-assisted&#13;
Education Reform Project (Loan 3724-RO). Selected staff of the district&#13;
education Inspectorates would also participate in these in-country workshops.&#13;
(b)   School facilities development and maintenance. The project will also provide the&#13;
expertise of a facilities planner/maintenance management expert to assist the&#13;
MOE to refine its school design standards, train GDTIC staff on the application of&#13;
up-to-date construction management techniques, and develop staff capacity to&#13;
manage the maintenance of public school facilities more effectively. The project&#13;
will support a program of in-country workshops on school facilities development&#13;
and maintenance for the MOE and relevant personnel of the District Education&#13;
Inspectorates, which will focus on the allocation and effective use of budgetary&#13;
resources for maintenance and management of the physical plant. The project&#13;
will also support the preparation, by the CPCU, of a study to determine more&#13;
effective methods for allocating budgetary funds for maintenance. An&#13;
integral element of this study would be to sensitize/familiarize MOE planners and&#13;
economists with the application of economic principles and methods for&#13;
developing a cost-effective and sustainable school facilities investment and&#13;
rehabilitation program. Short-term training abroad in related areas for selected&#13;
MOE and regional staff would complement the in-country workshops.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
2.13 During Negotiations, the Government provided assurances that it would: (a) by April&#13;
30, 2000, submit to the Bank, for its review, a draft study with recommendations on alternative&#13;
efficient allocation methods for pre-university school maintenance expenditures; (b)&#13;
immediately thereafterfinalize the study taking into consideration the Bank's comments on its&#13;
draft; and (c) carry out the recommendations of the study in accordance witlh thleir terms.&#13;
2.14   The project would finance: (a) individual consulting services (expatriate/national) in the&#13;
areas of school mapping (4 staff months), school facilities planning/physical plant maintenance&#13;
(I staff month); (b) short-term training abroad for selected MOE and regional education staff (8&#13;
staff months); (c) in-country training of MOE and Inspectorate staff; (d) 2 computers each (with&#13;
printer, scanner, modems, geographic information and standard applications software, etc.) for&#13;

2.15   Project Administration. To ensure that the project is implemented efficiently and in a&#13;
timely manner, the project would support the strengthening of the Central Project Coordination&#13;
Unit (CPCU) and the District Project Implementation Units (DPIUs).13 Recognizing the staffing&#13;
constraints and lack of construction management expertise in the MOE and in the Inspectorates,&#13;
the services of Romanian project/construction management firms (providing the expertise of&#13;
qualified/experienced engineers, architects, and economists/financial analysts and appropriate&#13;
support staff) would be contracted for the duration of the project, as needed, to benefit the CPCU&#13;
and the DPIUs, and strengthen the capacity to assess the scope of rehabilitation interventions in&#13;
affected schools, monitor, and supervise the implementation of the school rehabilitation program.&#13;
The services of a Procurement Advisor as well as a qualified independent Auditor would also be&#13;
contracted to assist the CPCU organize the project's procurement program, and audit the&#13;
accounts and annual expenditures of the project, respectively. Staff of the CPCU and GDTIC&#13;
would participate in short-term training conducted abroad in procurement, accounting and&#13;
contract management. In-country workshops would be organized to train DPIU staff in these&#13;
same areas. The project administration arrangements are described in more detail in Chapter 3,&#13;
Section C.&#13;
2.16   The project would finance: (a) consultant services for: (i) strengthening the management,&#13;
capacity of the CPCU and DPIUs; (ii) procurement management (2 staff months); and (iii)&#13;
annual audits of project accounts and expenditure; (b) short-term training abroad (6 staff&#13;
months); (c) in-country workshops including related training materials; (d) equipment consisting&#13;
of (i) for the CPCU: office, communications and computer equipment (with 6 desktop&#13;
computers, cellular phones, fax, modem, peripherals, copier, printer and applications software),&#13;
1 3    The Education Reform Project does not include financing of educational infrastructure, its objectives and&#13;
content focusing exclusively on the enhancement of educational quality, efficiency and relevance (i.e. curriculum,&#13;
teacher, training, assessment, etc.). Consequently, the Education Reform Project PCU is staffed with specialists&#13;
appropriately qualified to manage such programs, but they do not have the skills/experience to administer a large-&#13;
scale investment dedicated primarily to building/rehabilitating schools, such as the School Rehabilitation Project.&#13;
Thus, a separate coordinating unit dedicated to infrastructure rehabilitation was established to manage the School&#13;
Rehabilitation Project. The inadequacies of the GDTIC are already described in Chapter 1, para 1. 19, for which&#13;
reasons it was not designated to administer the project.&#13;

C. PROJECT RATIONALE&#13;
2.17   This section provides the overall economic justification and rationale for the project.&#13;
2.18   Linkage to Economic and Sector Work. There is consensus in economic literature that&#13;
investment in human capital generates a positive economic return to both an individual and to the&#13;
society at large. Recent work has shown that investment in improving the quality of learning&#13;
inputs such as curriculum, textbooks, and teachers has a powerful impact on improving student&#13;
achievement and earning potential.'4 A growing number of studies suggest that investment in&#13;
school infrastructure also has a significant impact on student learning, particularly if it is done in&#13;
conjunction with qualitative improvements in other inputs to the education system. As noted&#13;
earlier, investment in severely damaged and unsafe school infrastructure, as found in Romania,&#13;
has a major additional benefit in averting a potential loss of life of school occupants.&#13;
2.19   The private return to investment in education in Romania was the focus of a recent study&#13;
on Romanian labor markets.'5 The study found that secondary school graduates earn 17 percent&#13;
more than primary school leavers, and students completing higher education earn 36 percent&#13;
more than secondary school graduates. The private rate of return to investing in education is&#13;
low, however. An extra year of schooling yields only a 3.0 percent rate of return in Romania.'6&#13;
The main reason for the low private rates of return to education in Romania is the limited&#13;
dispersion of wages in the country. A recent study on the wage structure in transition economies&#13;
found that Romania has the most compressed wage structure in the CEE region. '7 The limited&#13;
wage dispersion in Romania can be attributed in large part to the public sector dominated labor&#13;

Poverty Assessment.&#13;
16  See Psacharopolous, G. (1995). "The Profitability of Investments in Education: Concepts and Methods",&#13;
Working Paper 63, World Bank, for the method. The rates of return estimate is obtained from regression estimates&#13;
of a standard earnings function for age, sex, experience, tenure, occupation, industry of individuals. (Skoufias,&#13;
1996). The private rate of return to secondary education (relative to primary) is only slightly higher in rural areas.&#13;
The rate of return to specialized vocation and apprentice streams is actually negative (relative to completing primary&#13;
school). The rates of return to education are evaluated relative to primary education since the number of individuals&#13;
with no education is minuscule--only 3 percent of the sample population. The social rates of return to education are&#13;
lower, by definition. The SAR (Report No. 1 5525-RO ) of the Reform of Higher Education and Research Project,&#13;
finds that the social rate of return to higher education is 7.5 percent.&#13;

market that does not accord a significant wage premium to more skilled workers. 8 The&#13;
increasing irrelevance of the pre-university education system itself contributes to a low rate of&#13;
return to education in Romania. Secondary school leavers constitute a large proportion of the&#13;
unemployed, are very likely to be poor, and are facing enormous difficulties (relative to college&#13;
graduates) in finding a job. A reform of the pre-university education system and private sector&#13;
led economic growth, both priorities of the new Government's reform agenda, should jointly&#13;
create an environment that will increase the returns to education in Romania.&#13;
2.20   Earlier economic and sector work, based on a thorough comparative analysis of the&#13;
education system in Romania relative to OECD countries, was the first to identify the qualitative&#13;
problems in the education system. The Bank's first piece of sector work on the country,&#13;
"Romania: Human Resources and the Transition to a Market Economy" and the Staff Appraisal&#13;
Report (SAR) of the Bank supported Education Reform Project, both pointed to the need for&#13;
improving the quality of education provided in Romania and outlined specific measures to&#13;
achieve this objective. These include investment in: (a) a revised curriculum; (b) adequate and&#13;
efficient (private) provision of textbooks; (c) in-service and pre-service teacher training; (d)&#13;
learning assessment tools; and (e) a modern management and financial capacity for allocating&#13;
scarce education resources to pressing sectoral needs. The Education Reform Project SAR also&#13;
cited "dysfunctional school infrastructure, the result of chronic under-investment in education in&#13;
the Ceaucescu era", as a major problem facing the Romanian education system.&#13;
2.21   A recent cross-country study on education finance confirms that Romania continues to&#13;
allocate the smallest share of its budget to education relative to most CEE countries.19 More&#13;
importantly, the share of capital expenditures in total education spending in Romania continues&#13;
to be amongst the lowest in the region. The Government's education strategy proposed in its&#13;
1993 White Paper on Education also highlights school infrastructure problems, albeit indirectly,&#13;
by recommending a modern financial and management system in the MOE that would better&#13;
allocate scarce resources to provide basic materials and maintain school infrastructure. More&#13;
recently, Government surveys of school facilities have revealed that most schools are very old,&#13;
poorly built and lacking essential facilities. Nearly 1,500 Romanian schools have severely&#13;
damaged buildings that daily pose a serious physical threat to school occupants. Nearly a fifth of&#13;
all damaged schools are located in urban areas. These schools are over-crowded, operating more&#13;
than 2 shifts and, from results of studies of similar environments in other countries, likely to have&#13;
an adverse impact on student achievement. The majority of the damaged, evacuated and&#13;
collapsed schools are located in rural areas. According to the Romania Poverty Assessment, the&#13;
poor standards or complete lack of school facilities in rural areas may be one reason for the low&#13;
participation rates in basic and secondary education found among the rural poor.&#13;
Is  The labor market does accord some premium to more skilled workers. (Skoufias, ibid.) The private rate of&#13;
return to completing lower secondary (relative to primary) is only I percent; completing secondary education yields&#13;
a private return of 3.0 percent (relative to lower secondary), while investment in higher education yields a 9.0&#13;
percent private rate of return (relative to secondary education).&#13;

2.22  This literature review indicates that the objectives of the project--to rehabilitate severely&#13;
damaged school buildings in imminent danger of collapse up to the safety and pedagogic norms&#13;
established by the MOE -- would, in addition to eliminating the physical risk to school&#13;
occupants, improve the quality of the education services in rural schools, and on those grounds&#13;
alone confer an enormous social and economic benefit to the affected individuals and to the&#13;
society at large.&#13;
2.23  Linkage to CAS. The 1997 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) reflects the conclusions&#13;
of the economic and sector work cited above and the major emphasis on education reform placed&#13;
by the Government's Development 2000 agenda. As such, the CAS places enormous importance&#13;
on investment in education as a long term strategy to alleviate poverty and promote economic&#13;
growth. Two on-going education projects: (a) the Education Reform Project that focuses on the&#13;
reform of basic and secondary education; and (b) the Higher Education Reform Project, support&#13;
improvements in the quality and coverage of the overall education system in Romania. These&#13;
projects form an essential component of the human resource development goals that feature&#13;
prominently in the CAS. The proposed School Rehabilitation Project is included in the core&#13;
program of the CAS in order to meet the pressing need to provide safe schools for the pre-&#13;
university education system in the context of the overall education sector reform program. This&#13;
need is reflected in the commitment of the new Government to the school rehabilitation program&#13;
and the urgency of its request for resources to rehabilitate damnaged schools.&#13;
2.24  Public/Private Justification. In the future, much like all developed market economies,&#13;
education in Romania is likely to be financed and provided by a mix of public and private&#13;
institutions. Private schooling is critical for serving the diverse educational needs of the&#13;
population, for reducing public spending on (higher income) students most likely to opt for&#13;
private schools, and, in concert with other mechanisms, for providing competition for the&#13;
services of the public school system. But, as in most developed market economies, a modem&#13;
public education system is likely to remain the main provider and financier of pre-university&#13;
education in Romania. The public education program, suitably reformed to address the emerging&#13;
needs of a market economy, would address the under provision of education (particularly to the&#13;
poor) likely to obtain from a purely private education system because of: (a) financial market&#13;
imperfections (inability of individuals to borrow against human capital); and (b) the inability of&#13;
private providers to capture the externalities (more civil society, greater social responsibility, and&#13;
a more uniform and highly educated population, higher growth rate) generated by an educated&#13;
work force for the country as a whole.&#13;
2.25   Policy Environment. The details of the policy environment were included in Chapter 1&#13;
and will therefore not be repeated here. It should be re-iterated, however, that the Education&#13;
Reform Program has received renewed commitment and support from the new Government.&#13;
As noted earlier, the Government resolve to improve the quality and availability of education&#13;
in line with OECD norms, and accelerate the pace of reforms in the education sector, is&#13;
evident from the goal of improving the quality of the human capital base that it has set itself as&#13;
a cornerstone of its Development 2000 policy agenda.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
2.26 Analysis of Alternatives. Three alternative project designs were considered: the first&#13;
alternative was no Bank support at all; Alternative 2 was to limit investments exclusively to&#13;
strengthen the damaged school buildings; and Alternative 3 was to strengthen the buildings and&#13;
relieve the congestion in the classrooms by providing additional rooms to accommodate students&#13;
in the third or later shifts, and upgrade the schools to meet the minimum standards necessary to&#13;
attain the pedagogical and qualitative objectives of the Education Reform Program.&#13;
(a)   Project Not Financed. Without the project, the Government would continue to&#13;
repair damaged schools to protect school occupants as mandated by Government&#13;
Law OGR 20/1994. The major constraints in investment funds would be&#13;
surmounted eventually. Over time, a large number of seriously damaged schools&#13;
would be rehabilitated, and the apprehension about the safety of the occupants&#13;
would be alleviated. However, in the meantime, cohorts of students would&#13;
complete their education in pedagogically inappropriate (crowded, etc.), and&#13;
unsafe physical environments. In the event of further serious earthquakes,&#13;
substantially avoidable injury or loss of life would not have been averted. On the&#13;
fiscal side, without the project, the Government would incur higher recurrent costs&#13;
over the life of the school and a higher capital cost of rehabilitating a more&#13;
damaged school building in the future.&#13;
(b)   Finance Only Strengthening of Damaged Structures. Under this alternative the&#13;
project would only finance the structural strengthening of damaged schools.&#13;
Schools would not be expanded to reduce over-crowding, nor consolidated with&#13;
nearby schools. The Government would invest only in the structural&#13;
strengthening of schools with the potential of receiving the following benefits: (i)&#13;
saving student/teacher lives; (ii) fiscal savings in lower capital and recurrent costs&#13;
from rehabilitating schools now as opposed to later when school buildings are&#13;
more damaged; (iii) improved learning and earning capability of students in&#13;
schools where the strengthening of schools to their former capacity would reduce&#13;
overcrowding and/or improve access to schools. Room for further improvements&#13;
in student learning would remain. Despite structural strengthening, some schools&#13;
(without expansion) would still remain crowded. In addition, further fiscal&#13;
savings from the consolidation of nearby under-utilized schools would not be&#13;
realized.&#13;
(c)   Strengthen the Structures, Relieve Student Overcrowding and Upgrade Schools&#13;
to Meet Minimum Quality Standards. The conclusion reached from considering&#13;
the first two alternatives is that capital investments in the educational physical&#13;
plant to ensure a safe leaming environment should take place simultaneously with&#13;
qualitative investments in the learning environment consistent with the Education&#13;
Reform Program. This alternative would yield a higher NPV than either of the&#13;
alternatives presented above because it would: (i) consolidate under-utilized&#13;
facilities in the same catchment area and thereby generate fiscal savings; and (ii)&#13;
expand buildings (if needed) to reduce crowding in schools and thereby improve&#13;
student achievement and earning streams. In addition, by rehabilitating rural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
schools to their full learning potential, the project would improve education status&#13;
of individuals in rural areas and assist in alleviating rural poverty. By supporting&#13;
the qualitative standards espoused in the Education Reform Program, the project&#13;
would also contribute to the development of a skilled human capital base and&#13;
promote economic growth.&#13;
2.27   Cost-Benefits/Cost-Effectiveness. The major benefit of the project is to eliminate the&#13;
physical risk to students and teachers posed by school buildings in imminent danger of&#13;
collapse.20 A rough approximation of the benefit cost ratio for the project can be obtained by&#13;
using data on total enrollments, shifts, gross area, and the number of classes available for each&#13;
damaged school. Using this data, and under particular simplifying assumptions, the school&#13;
rehabilitation cost is estimated at US$109 million. In the most pessimistic case, assuming a 100&#13;
percent probability of damage in each school, the project would save about 33,000 lives (one life&#13;
saved for US$3,300 invested). In an optimistic case, assuming a 1O percent probability of&#13;
damage for each school, the project would save about 3,300 lives (one life for US$33,000&#13;
invested). There is considerable controversy in the literature on how a human life should be&#13;
valued. However it is possible to define a range for the value of life over which the benefit/cost&#13;
ratio of the project would exceed unity. Specifically, the benefit-cost ratio would exceed unity if&#13;
the value of life exceeds US$3,000 in the optimistic case and exceeds US$33,000 in the&#13;
pessimistic case. Thus, if the present discounted value of lifetime wages for a student in&#13;
Romania (US$48,000)2 were used as indicative of a value ol life to Romanian society, the&#13;
project's benefit-cost ratio would (far) exceed one.&#13;
2.28   Fiscal Impact. In addition to saving lives, the project would yield benefits in fiscal&#13;
savings22 through (a) reduced recurrent and investment costs as a result of rehabilitating schools&#13;
now as opposed to later when schools are more depreciated or collapsed, and (b) reduced&#13;
recurrent costs from consolidating under-utilized schools as a result of a reduction in the number&#13;
of staff and maintenance area. Fiscal savings from the improvement in the learning environment&#13;
(lower drop out and repetition rates) and improved access to schools in under-served areas&#13;
(future reduction in social assistance and other poverty related benefits), difficult to quantify as a&#13;
result of data limitations, have not been estimated. Thus, fiscal savings estimates provide a&#13;
lower bound on the total fiscal saving generated by the project. Results emerging from the&#13;
Tulcea pilot test show that, in almost all scenarios undertaken to date, the internal rate of return&#13;
(IRR) from fiscal savings alone is at least 47 percent, well above a reasonable project return of&#13;
10 percent.(Annex 3B). It should be noted however that savings in recurrent cost deriving from&#13;
the proposed project, may need to be used to maintain or increase the overall Government capital&#13;
and recurrent budget for school infrastructure. The Government currently allocates less than the&#13;
20 The mathematical derivation of benefit cost ratio of the project is presented in Annex 3.&#13;
21     Assuming students would earn the average wage in Romania, about $100 per month, and realise a working&#13;
life of 40 years.&#13;
22     The net benefit of the project is the sum over all schools of the present discounted value of the benefits&#13;
from rehabilitating each school: (i) savings in recurrent and capital costs (ii) the total number of lives saved; (iii)&#13;
incremental earning stream from improvements in student achievements and access to schools in each school.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
stipulated 5 percent of value of old, and 1.5 percent of the value of new school buildings towards&#13;
their maintenance.&#13;
2.29  DuringNegotiations, tle Governmentprovided assurances that it would take all&#13;
necessary measures on its part to ensure: (a) that every fiscal year, starting in 2001, adequate&#13;
budgetary resources are allocated to allow adequate maintenance of thle schools rehabilitated,&#13;
upgraded andfurnished under the project; and (b) thzat such budgetary allocations are utilized&#13;
for their intended purpose.&#13;
2.30   Poverty Analysis. The Romania Poverty Assessment finds that households headed by&#13;
less educated individuals are more likely to be poor (relative to more educated household heads).&#13;
More worrisome, the Poverty Assessment indicates that, unless addressed, this aspect of poverty&#13;
is likely to persist in the future. Children of households with less educated parents are less likely&#13;
to be enrolled in school. This problems is more severe in rural areas. Rural household heads&#13;
have completed far fewer years of education, and rural children are less likely to be enrolled in&#13;
school. By rehabilitating mainly rural schools and ensuring that all rehabilitated schools have&#13;
adequate facilities, this project, in the context of the overall education program, will improve the&#13;
quality and (in some cases) the coverage of education in the poorest communities in the country.&#13;
In doing so, it will contribute to raising low education status in rural areas and alleviate one of&#13;
the fundamental causes of poverty in Romania.&#13;
2.31  Institutional Capacity and Regulatory Framework. The commitment of the new&#13;
Government to implement the project is unusually high. Project preparation began in early 1996,&#13;
with a small team (two researchers) that began to gather data on damaged schools in Tulcea and&#13;
Vaslui (the most disadvantaged district) which were selected as pilots. But the MOE's inability&#13;
to allocate resources for project preparation (and hiring technical experts for the purpose)&#13;
curtailed preparation activities. These activities only picked up momentum in January 1997,&#13;
after the national elections. The new Minister of Education announced his and the incoming&#13;
Government's full support for the operation. The School Rehabilitation Board (SRB) was&#13;
reactivated and its Working Group became fully staffed in February 1997. Since then, the&#13;
Working Group accomplished an impressive amount of preparatory work. It has: (a) completed a&#13;
school database on about 190 urban and 350 rural schools; (b) prepared detailed standards 23 for&#13;
school design, construction and furnishing; (c) prepared and (in pilot district Vaslui) started to&#13;
apply the economic criteria for prioritizing schools for rehabilitation and determining the scope&#13;
of rehabilitation interventions in the affected schools; and (d) drafted the procedures for project&#13;
administration, procurement and implementation, all of which are embodied in a draft Project&#13;
Implementation Plan. These preparatory activities have laid the ground work and built capacity&#13;
for the implementation of the school rehabilitation program according to sound economic&#13;
principles and acceptable safety and pedagogic norms, and enabled earlier project appraisal.&#13;
2.32   The capacity to implement the rehabilitation of damaged schools is evident from the&#13;
outcome of recent MOE efforts. Since 1995, the structural strengthening of about 200 damaged&#13;
23    These standards would be applied to the development and rehabilitation of educational infrastructure&#13;
nationally&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
schools 24 has been completed and repairs are in progress in another 400. The works were&#13;
implemented by the District Education Inspectorates which used local expertise to prepare the&#13;
technical groundwork for rehabilitating the schools. This demonstrates that, provided resources&#13;
are made available, expertise can be recruited when needed to assist the MOE and the District&#13;
Inspectorates in school rehabilitation. The construction sector has sufficient capacity to&#13;
undertake the volume of work envisioned under the project. About 120,000 construction firms&#13;
(large and small) were registered with the MPWTP as of February 1997. Only 9,200 of these&#13;
firms (with about 418,000 employees) reported construction activities, indicating that substantial&#13;
construction capacity is untapped and available for the project. The reported turnover in civil&#13;
works contracts at the end of June 1996, was about 4,590 billion Lei (about US$665 million).&#13;
2.33   The MOE General Directorate for Technical Investment Coordination is a small unit&#13;
which lacks the manpower and the management skills required to plan and oversee a large&#13;
educational infrastructure program. The regulatory capacity of the GDTIC unit is already over-&#13;
extended (see para 1. 19). The regulatory capacity of the GDTIC will be strengthened under the&#13;
project in order that it can implement the Government's school investment program more&#13;
effectively and efficiently. The capacity enhancing measures included in the project are&#13;
described in paragraphs 2.12-2.15 above.&#13;
2.34   Environmental Analysis. This project is in Category C. The project would support the&#13;
preparation of environmental guidelines for school construction and maintenance programs. In&#13;
particular, special attention would be given to the proper removal, handling and disposal of&#13;
asbestos, if it is found in the schools to be rehabilitated. Furthermore, no asbestos or asbestos&#13;
containing materials would be purchased for use in the rehabilitation program.&#13;
24    1 1 0 completed schools were financed by the MOE budget, and 76 schools were rehabilitated with District&#13;
funds.&#13;

A. COST AND FINANCING&#13;
3.1     Proiect Cost. The total project cost is estimated at US$130.0 million equivalent including&#13;
contingencies, taxes and duties, with base costs estimated at about US$106.5 million. Total&#13;
contingencies (US$23.5 million) which represent 22 percent of the base cost include: (a) physical&#13;
contingencies of US$14.7 million; and (b) price contingencies between project appraisal (March&#13;
1997) and completion at the end of the five year project implementation period, estimated at&#13;
US$8.8 million. The total foreign exchange component (direct and indirect costs) of the project&#13;
is calculated at US$22.6 million including contingencies, or about 17 percent of total project&#13;
cost. Taxes and duties on works and services are estimated at US$23.4 million equivalent. The&#13;
project cost summaries, by component and by type of expenditure, are shown below in Table 3.1&#13;
and Table 3.2, respectively. The basis for the estimates of project cost, and the detailed cost&#13;

3.2     Einancing. The Project would be financed by a World Bank Loan of US$70.0 million&#13;
equivalent, a Loan from the Council of Europe Social Development Fund of US$13.8 million&#13;
equivalent, and Government counterpart funds equivalent to US$46.2 million. The proposed&#13;
Bank Loan, which will cover about 66 percent of total project cost net of taxes and duties, will&#13;
finance about 83 percent of the estimated direct and indirect foreign exchange cost and 61&#13;
percent of total local cost excluding taxes. The CESDF Loan would finance about 17 percent of&#13;
the total foreign cost and 13 percent of local cost excluding taxes. The proceeds of the CESDF&#13;
Loan would co-finance only the building rehabilitation costs. The Government will finance the&#13;
remaining local costs including all taxes and duties. For risk management considerations, the&#13;
Government opted to select the standard variable rate, currency pool Loan from the Bank. The&#13;
Government has received a commitment from CESDF to co-finance the project, and is expected&#13;
to sign a separate loan agreement with CESDF for the CESDF Loan. A Grant of US$131,000&#13;
equivalent was made available last July, 1996, by the Japanese Government to the Romanian&#13;
Government to finance project preparation. The financing arrangements under the project are&#13;
summarized in Table 3.3 and Table 3.4 below.&#13;

B. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
3.4   The project would be implemented over a five-year period between 1998-2002, and&#13;
expected to be completed by July 31, 2002. The detailed implementation schedule is shown in&#13;
the PIP. The MOE has demonstrated its capacity to complete the project within five years, by the&#13;
progress it has a achieved during the past two years rehabilitating about 600 out of the 1,500&#13;
most damaged schools, commissioned with Government funding (paras 1.16 and 2.32). Project&#13;
activities undertaken during the first year of project implementation are expected to focus largely&#13;
on low-disbursing but essential activities that will provide a more comprehensive picture of the&#13;
project interventions, and facilitate implementation and procurement planning. Thus, no&#13;
significant expenditures or disbursement of project funds are expected during the first year.&#13;
These essential activities include:&#13;
(a)   the issuance of a General Procurement Notice in the Development Business&#13;
Publication immediately following Board Approval of the project;&#13;
(b)   at the start of project implementation (or soon after Loan Effectiveness), a Project&#13;
Launch Seminar would be organized by the CPCU in collaboration with the&#13;
Bank. Representatives of relevant institutions, including, the District Councils,&#13;
District Education Inspectorates, DPIUs, project schools, and other agencies&#13;
including the MOF, Court of Accounts, MPWTP and CESDF would be invited to&#13;
participate for full briefings on the project scope and objectives. The Project&#13;
Launch Seminar will: (i) provide a forum for clarifying implementation processes,&#13;
procedures and documentation; (ii) open lines of communication for better&#13;
coordination and more efficient implementation; and (iii) provide an opportunity&#13;
for building capacity, particularly in the DPIUs, in the areas of procurement and&#13;
accounts management;&#13;
(c)   completion of school maps covering the catchment area of the damaged schools&#13;
(in cases where other schools of the same level are found within the catchment&#13;
area of the affected school);&#13;
(d)   definition of the scope of work (para 2.6) for rehabilitating all project schools,&#13;
including the preparation of preliminary architectural and rehabilitation plans for&#13;
about 15 percent of the project schools. Civil works initiated in the first year will&#13;
primarily cover schools in the pilot districts of Tulcea and Vaslui where project&#13;
preparation is advanced and the school mapping exercise has been substantially&#13;
completed. This will have a demonstration effect and will be used to fine-tune&#13;
implementation processes;&#13;
(e)   the provision of basic office equipment for the CPCU and DPIUs; and&#13;
(f)   training of local staff in project implementation procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. PROJECT MANAGEMENT&#13;
3.5    Overview. In line with the project's capacity building objectives, the implementation&#13;
arrangements have been designed to employ the existing institutions and institutional units of the&#13;
MOE and of the Districts. The project would provide the appropriate technical expertise to&#13;
strengthen these institutions as needed. The Minister of Education, who will have the&#13;
responsibility for the project, has assigned the overall administration of this investment operation&#13;
to the School Rehabilitation Board (SRB). To ensure continuity between project preparation and&#13;
implementation, the Working Group organized to support the SRB in project preparation has&#13;
been integrated into the SRB's operational unit -- the Central Project Coordination Unit -- which&#13;
will oversee the day-to-day implementation of the School Rehabilitation Project. Technical&#13;
specialists who assisted the Working Group in project preparation have been assimilated into the&#13;
CPCU, thereby ensuring retention of the in-depth understanding of the project and the lessons&#13;
learned during preparation. This would contribute to more effective project management&#13;
response to any issues that may arise during project implementation. School rehabilitation&#13;
activities at the local level will be supervised by small Project Implementation Units established&#13;
in each District Education Inspectorate. Project funds (provided by the Bank, CESDF and the&#13;
Governmnent) will be administered by the MOE General Directorate for Human Resources and&#13;
Finance (GDHRF) in close collaboration with the CPCU. These units and their responsibilities&#13;
are briefly described in the following paragraphs, and discussed in greater detail, in the PIP.&#13;
3.6    School Rehabilitation Board. The SRB was established by the Minister of Education in&#13;
April, 1996, to exercise general direction over the project, ensure that project objectives remain&#13;
consistent with the Education Reform Program and priorities, and ensure that standards which&#13;
govern the quality of educational infrastructure in Romania are met by the project. Chaired by&#13;
the Secretary of State for Higher Education 25, the SRB includes representatives of the MPWTP,&#13;
the MOF, the Directors of the OIS, GDTIC and GRHRF, as well as representatives from two&#13;
District Councils. The CPCU serves as the operational arm of the SRB responsible for overall&#13;
project coordination and implementation.&#13;
3.7    Central Project Coordination Unit. The CPCU was organized by the MOE by virtue of&#13;
Ministry of Education Order No. 4114/20.06.1997 to conduct the overall administration of the&#13;
project under the general guidance of the SRB. The CPCU is headed by a Project Manager&#13;
assisted by six key technical specialists (including Architect/Engineer, Economist/Financial&#13;
Officer, Educator and School Mapping Specialist) and an administrative secretary proficient in&#13;
English, selected on the basis of their qualifications for the respective tasks. One of the technical&#13;
specialists will be designated as the Procurement Officer. The services of other support staff for&#13;
the CPCU will be recruited as necessary for efficiency, after consultations with the Bank. The&#13;
services of the specialists to benefit the CPCU would be financed from the project resources.&#13;
25    Although the project directly benefits pre-university schools, the Secretary of State for Higher Education&#13;
has been appointed to chair the SRB because the MOE Directorate of Construction and Investment, which has&#13;
general oversight of the development of all public educational infrastructure, is under his jurisdiction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
3.8   The SRB would make provisions for the CPCU to fornulate and implement a program to&#13;
transfer the skills and experience gained during project implementation to regular staff in the&#13;
mainstream of MOE operations, which include those of the GDTIC and the District Education&#13;
Inspectorates. This skills transfer would be realized through periodic in-country training sessions&#13;
for selected MOE and Judet staff, and would be reinforced by staff involvement in the annual and&#13;
mid-term reviews of project performance (in which the Bank, CESDF, or other institutions may&#13;
participate). To ensure efficient operation, the CPCU would be equipped, through the project,&#13;
with up-to-date office technology (computers, printers, fax, modems, cellular communications,&#13;
etc.) and two vehicles for site supervision. In addition, selected CPCU and regional education&#13;
staff would be given the opportunity to undertake short-term training abroad in areas that would&#13;
strengthen project management capacity, as well as familiarize them with Bank procurement and&#13;
operational procedures. The specific functions of the CPCU are to:&#13;
(a)   manage project implementation activities and the use of resources;&#13;
(b)   control the quality of the rehabilitation works by ensuring that the agreed norms,&#13;
criteria and procedures (paras 2.5 - 2.9) are consistently applied by the&#13;
implementing units at central and Judet levels. Such norms and procedures&#13;
include: school design standards; criteria and methodologies for defining options&#13;
and scope of school rehabilitation interventions and prioritization of schools. The&#13;
CPCU will coordinate with the GDTIC and with MPWTP in matters related to&#13;
civil works such that the planning and execution of the rehabilitation works under&#13;
the project meet the prescribed norms for structural safety, sanitation, security,&#13;
and economic efficiency, etc. CPCU will monitor the performance of each DPIU&#13;
respective of the supervision of these contracts;&#13;
(c)   ensure that the appropriate procedures and documentation for procurement,&#13;
accounting, auditing, reporting and such other guidelines embodied in the Loan&#13;
Agreement are applied by all implementing units, monitor performance under all&#13;
procurement contracts, and ensure the delivery of the contracted goods and&#13;
services to the appropriate recipients. The designated Procurement Officer (para&#13;
3.7) will have responsibility for overseeing procurement activities under the&#13;
project. The CPCU will procure equipment for its use and for the DPIUs;&#13;
(d)   monitor project costs and expenditures, and coordinate with the GRHRF in the&#13;
execution of the Bank and CESDF Loans as well as the Government counterpart&#13;
funds, and ensure that project funds are appropriately used, accounted for, and&#13;
audited. The CPCU will keep separate and accurate up-to-date records of the&#13;
disbursement of project funds on contracts for goods, works and services in each&#13;
project school;&#13;
(e)   take the responsibility for the organization of training programs (in-country and&#13;
abroad) and the recruitment of specialist services for the capacity building&#13;
component of the project, and monitor the outcome of the training and technical&#13;
assistance provided under the project; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31-&#13;
(f)   monitor implementation progress, and liaise with and report to Government and&#13;
other relevant institutions (including MOF, MPWTP, the Bank and CESDF) on&#13;
this progress and project-related developments.&#13;
3.9   District Project Implementation Units. School rehabilitation activities at the local level&#13;
will be supervised by small Project Implementation Units established in each District Education&#13;
Inspectorate. These DPIUs have also been organized by virtue of the Ministerial Order described&#13;
above (para 3.7). Each DPIU is under the general direction of the District School Inspectorate,&#13;
and the performance of the DPIUs will be closely monitored by the CPCU. The DPIUs will&#13;
supervise all facets of project implementation related to the rehabilitation of schools within the&#13;
district: selection of specialists to prepare detailed surveys, architectural and engineering&#13;
documents; organization and award of construction tenders; and final acceptance of completed&#13;
works contracts. As in the case of the CPCU and the services of technical specialists (including&#13;
architects/engineers and economist/accountant) would be remunerated out of project resources.&#13;
D. PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
3.10  Procurement under the Project will consist of: (a) contracting of civil works (school&#13;
rehabilitation); (b) the acquisition of school furniture and minor equipment (office, software,&#13;
vehicles); and (c) engagement of specialist services and training of local staff. Procurement of&#13;
works and goods will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the August 1996&#13;
revision of the Bank Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits&#13;
(Procurement Guidelines). Specialist services and training contracts will be procured in&#13;
accordance with the January 1997 Bank Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by&#13;
World Bank Borrowers (Consultant Guidelines). The procurement arrangements are&#13;
summarized in Table 3.5. An estimate of the packaging arrangements and timing of procurement&#13;
contracts is shown in the Procurement Plan (Annex 6). The packaging of bids, as well as&#13;
contract review requirements under the Project are briefly described below. The specific details&#13;
of these procurement processes, including the required documentation, are described in the PIP:&#13;
(a)   Civil Works. (US$109.0 million including contingencies) School rehabilitation&#13;
contracts under the project would have a wide range of characteristics: geographic&#13;
dispersal, particularly those in rural areas; execution period as a result of the&#13;
sequencing of school rehabilitation (para 2.7); school capacities (enrollments&#13;
varying from less than 20 to 2,700 students); type and scope of works&#13;
(rehabilitation to full replacement of buildings, see para 2.6); and estimated costs.&#13;
Some affected urban schools may be clustered relatively close to each other, but&#13;
most rural schools are in isolated localities, many of which have difficult access.&#13;
To the extent feasible, all civil works contracts would be grouped into packages&#13;
that would permit wider competition among a broad spectrum of works&#13;
contractors, achieve economy of scale, and improve procurement effectiveness by&#13;
ensuring that contracts for schools in remote locations are not shunned by bidders.&#13;
Works packages estimated to cost US$1.0 million equivalent or more per package&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
would be procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) adapting&#13;
the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) for the Procurement of Works&#13;
(Smaller Contracts). However, the geographic dispersal of the schools, the&#13;
prioritization scheme (see para 2.7), and the type of works (rehabilitation) may not&#13;
make it feasible nor practical in most cases to group these contracts into packages&#13;
attractive enough for ICB. Therefore, contracts of this nature would be procured&#13;
using other than ICB procedures (up to an aggregate value of US$92.5 million)&#13;
as follows: (i) National Competitive Bidding (7NCB) procedures for contract&#13;
packages estimated to cost below US$1.0 million equivalent per package; and (ii)&#13;
procurement of small works contracts estimated at less than US$70,000&#13;
equivalent per package may be procured under lump-sum, fixed price contracts&#13;
awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from at least three qualified domestic&#13;
contractors in response to a written invitation. Within the aggregate total for non-&#13;
ICB works procurement, procedures for the procurement of small works contracts&#13;
may be applied up to an aggregate amount of US$5.5 million. Procurement&#13;
through NCB would be in accordance with procedures agreed with the Bank using&#13;
the Bank's Regional SBD for NCB for works. Documentation for small works&#13;
procurement would be standardized and cleared with the Bank prior to issuance of&#13;
the first package. Interested foreign civil works contractors would not be&#13;
precluded from submitting tenders invited either through NCB or procedures for&#13;
small works contracts. All works contracts would be co-financed by the CESDF&#13;
and procured in accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines.&#13;
(b)   Goods. Bid packages for the procurement of goods are not expected to exceed&#13;
US$300,000 equivalent per package (the threshold deemed attractive for ICB).&#13;
However, any goods packages estimated at more than US$300,000 per package&#13;
would be procured through ICB, and would be subject to the Bank's prior review&#13;
as provided under Section II and Appendix 1, respectively, of the Bank&#13;
Procurement Guidelines. In such cases, domestic manufacturers would be given a&#13;
margin of preference in bid evaluation as provided for in Section II C of the&#13;
Procurement Guidelines. For contract packages less than US$300,000, the&#13;
procurement of goods would be undertaken as follows:&#13;
(i)   Furiture. (US$5.0 million including contingencies) School furniture&#13;
(student desks) is bulky, and the difficulty of delivering these goods to&#13;
dispersed rural schools make it unattractive for international manufacturers&#13;
to participate in tenders for furniture. Furthermore, Romania has the&#13;
capacity to produce the type, quality and quantity of school furniture&#13;
required under the project at competitive prices. Thus, National&#13;
Competitive Bidding procedures would be applied for the procurement of&#13;
school furniture (aggregate US$5.0 million) in accordance with the&#13;
provisions of Section II of the Procurement Guidelines, and adapting the&#13;
Bank's Regional SBD for NCB for goods. Furniture contracts estimated&#13;
at less than US$30,000 per package may be procured through National&#13;
Shopping (NS) procedures based on quotations obtained from at least&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
three suppliers. NS procedures may be used up to an aggregate value of&#13;
US$1.5 million out of the US$5.0 aggregate for NCB. Foreign furniture&#13;
manufacturers/suppliers, would not be precluded from submitting&#13;
proposals for furniture contracts invited through NCB or NS procedures.&#13;
(ii)   Equipment and Other Goods. (US$500,000 including contingencies)&#13;
Equipment, materials and supplies contracts estimated at less that&#13;
US$300,000 per package may be procured through International&#13;
Shopping (IS) procedures (aggregate US$300,000) based on at least three&#13;
price quotations obtained from suppliers originating from at least two&#13;
eligible source countries. Goods contracts estimated at less than&#13;
US$30,000 per package (aggregate US$100,000) may be procured through&#13;
National Shopping where the desired goods are ordinarily available&#13;
locally from more than one source at competitive prices. Procurement&#13;
through NS would be based on a minimum of three price quotations&#13;
obtained from qualified suppliers. Computer software, books, copyrights&#13;
and other items which the Bank agrees are of proprietary nature (aggregate&#13;
US$100,000), may be procured through Direct Contracting without&#13;
competition.&#13;
(c)   Consultant Services/Training. The procurement of services included in this&#13;
category would be as follows:&#13;
(i)    Architectural and engineering (A&amp;E) services. (aggregate US$8.1 million)&#13;
These services would be procured using the Quality and Cost Based&#13;
Selection (QCBS) procedures described in Section II of the Bank&#13;
Consultant Guidelines. The A&amp;E services will be provided in such a&#13;
manner that the scope of the assignment includes the preparation of&#13;
feasibility studies and technical designs (architectural, engineering,&#13;
bidding documents, etc.) for a group of schools.;&#13;
(ii)   Other specialist services would be procured using three methods: (1)&#13;
Selection under a Fixed Budget (aggregate US$8.2 million) as described&#13;
in Section III para 3.5 of the Bank's Consultant Guidelines for contracting&#13;
specialists to the benefit of the CPCU and the DPIUs, and for auditing&#13;
services; (2) Single Source selection (aggregate US$200,000) as described&#13;
in Section III paras 3.8 - 3.11 of the Bank's Consultant Guidelines for&#13;
training; and (3) Selection of Individual Consultants on the Basis of&#13;
their Qualifications for the assignment (aggregate US$175,000) in hiring&#13;
specialist services for school mapping, project management, procurement&#13;
and maintenance management to support capacity building initiatives&#13;
under the project.&#13;
(d)   Recurrent expenditure items would be financed entirely by the Government and&#13;
procured in accordance with Government procedures.&#13;

3.11   Prior Review of Procurement Contracts. All contracts financed under the project will&#13;
follow the Bank's documentation requirements (paras 3.12(a) and (b)(i)). Prior to the issuance of&#13;
any invitations to prequalify for bidding or to bid for contracts, the CPCU will furnish to the&#13;
Bank for its review and approval, the proposed scheduling of the procurement process&#13;
(Procurement Plan) in accordance with the provisions of Appendix 1, Section 1 of the&#13;
Procurement Guidelines. The procurement of all goods, works and services would be&#13;
undertaken in accordance with such Procurement Plan as will have been approved by the Bank.&#13;
It is estimated that up to 500 contracts would be signed during the implementation of the project&#13;
(see Annex 6). Prior review by the Bank is expected to cover an estimated value of about US$42&#13;
million (out of US$125 million) of works, goods and services. All other contracts would be&#13;
subject to post review by the Bank in line with the provisions described in Appendix 1, Section 2&#13;
of the Procurement Guidelines, and Appendix 1 Section 2 of the Consultant Guidelines. The&#13;
Bank's prior review will include the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
(a)    Civil works: Prior to the issuance of bids, the CPCU will submit to the Bank for&#13;
review, the complete bidding documentation (bid invitation, bid proposal forms,&#13;
bills of quantities, commercial and technical conditions of tender and of contract,&#13;
building rehabilitation plans, technical specifications, and draft contract&#13;
agreements) for: (i) all works contract packages procured through ICB; and (ii)&#13;
the first works contract in each District to be procured through NCB;&#13;
(b)    Goods: Prior to tenders being invited, the CPCU will submit to the Bank for&#13;
review, the complete bidding documentation (bid invitation, bid proposal forms,&#13;
commercial and technical conditions of tender and of contract, master lists and&#13;
technical specifications, and draft contract agreements) for the first furniture&#13;
package procured through NCB, and the first equipment package procured&#13;
through IS;&#13;
(c)    Services: Prior review requirements for the award of consultant services contracts&#13;
will be in accordance with the provisions of Appendix 1, Section 2 (Prior Review)&#13;
of the Consultant Guidelines. The Bank will conduct a prior review of: (i) the&#13;
first contract for each district and each contract costing the equivalent of&#13;
US$I00,000 or more for architectural and engineering services; (ii) auditing&#13;
services; and (iii) the first three contracts for individual consultants.&#13;
E. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.12   The disbursement profile of the project does not depart significantly from standard&#13;
disbursement profiles for education projects. The MOE has the requisite capacity to execute the&#13;
project over a period of five years, and the Loan proceeds are expected to be fully disbursed&#13;
within five and one-half years (eleven semesters) after Board Approval. The Closing Date will&#13;
be January 31, 2003. The disbursements estimated for the first two semesters of project&#13;
implementation are not expected to be significant (para 3.4) and are based on initial deposits into&#13;
the Special Account (see para 3.15). The estimated semestral disbursements are shown below in&#13;
Table 3.6.&#13;

3.13  Procedures for disbursement on contracts financed by the Bank are described in the Bank&#13;
Disbursement Handbook. All disbursement of project funds, including the Bank Loan, the&#13;
CESDF Loan and the Government counterpart will be under the overall supervision of the&#13;
Director of the GDHRF and monitored by the CPCU. Disbursement would be made against&#13;
Statements of Expenditure (SOE) certified by the Directors of the GDHRF and the CPCU for: (a)&#13;
disbursements below US$300,000 equivalent for works and goods contracts; and (b)&#13;
disbursements below US$100,000 for consulting firms and US$50,000 for individual&#13;
consultants. This SOE form would also state that all contracts related to these SOEs have been&#13;
awarded in accordance with criteria and procedures agreed with the Bank. All documentation&#13;
supporting SOEs will be retained by the CPCU for at least one year after receipt by the Bank of&#13;
the audit report for the year in which the last disbursement was made. This documentation&#13;
would be made available for review by the auditors and by visiting Bank staff upon request.&#13;
3.14   Disbursements from the Bank Loan proceeds for eligible expenditures incurred under the&#13;
project will be withdrawn in accordance with the disbursement schedule shown in Table 3.7&#13;
below. The disbursement percentages in each expenditure category are based on the total&#13;
estimated cost of each expenditure category including contingencies, local taxes and duties. The&#13;
Bank financing under each category does not include local taxes and duties, these are covered by&#13;
the Government share of disbursements. In the case of disbursements under Category 1 (Civil&#13;
Works), all works expenditures are co-financed by the CESDF Loan. The Bank share of&#13;
disbursements against total works expenditures would be 52 percent, the CESDF Loan&#13;
disbursement would cover 12.6 percent, and the Government will disburse the balance (35.4&#13;
percent). The Bank disbursement rate under Category 1 would be adjusted prior to the Closing&#13;
Date to appropriately reflect the final costs of civil works expenditures. The Government share&#13;
of disbursements includes all taxes and duties applicable to works contracts. The unallocated&#13;
amount under Category 4 is higher than what is normally provided (10 percent of the total Loan)&#13;
in Bank Loan disbursement schedules. This is due to the higher physical contingencies (15&#13;
percent of estimated base costs) which have been included in the cost estimates because of the&#13;
nature of the works (building rehabilitation).&#13;

3.15   Special Accon. To facilitate the timely implementation of the project, the Government&#13;
will establish, maintain and operate, under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special&#13;
Account denominated in US Dollars, in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank. The Special&#13;
Account would be used under the direction of the Director of the GRHRF in coordination with&#13;
the CPCU Project Manager, following procedures established by the Bank. The Special Account&#13;
will have an Authorized Allocation of US$5.0 million in order to cover the estimated average&#13;
disbursements for a three-month period for the Bank-financed expenditures during the peak years&#13;
(years 2-4) of project implementation. At the start of the project, the Special Account deposit&#13;
will be limited to half the Authorized Allocation (US$2.5 million) and the remaining portion of&#13;
the Authorized Allocation will be disbursed upon Government request when the aggregate&#13;
amount of withdrawals from the Loan Account plus the total amount of all outstanding Special&#13;
Commitments entered into by the Bank shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of US$5.0&#13;
million. Specifically:&#13;
(a)    applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted on a&#13;
monthly basis or when one half of the amount deposited had been withdrawn,&#13;
whichever occurred earlier, and must include reconciled bank statements as well&#13;
as other appropriate supporting documents;&#13;
(b)    all other applications for direct payment, special commitment or reimbursement&#13;
should be for amounts not less than 20 percent of the initial deposit of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
Authorized Allocation to the Special Account or not less than 20 percent of the&#13;
full Authorized Allocation once available;&#13;
(c)   submission of replenishment applications takes precedence over the minimum&#13;
size application as stated in (b) above.&#13;
F. ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS&#13;
3.16  Project Accon. A Project Account in Romania Lei, will also be established by the&#13;
Government under the general direction of the Director of the GRHRF, to finance expenditures&#13;
to be covered by Government counterpart financing. Appropriate arrangements would also be&#13;
made for disbursements on works contracts financed by the CESDF Loan. Disbursements on&#13;
eligible expenditures would be effected simultaneously from the Special Account and the Project&#13;
Account in the respective financing ratios derived from Table 3.7 above. In the case of&#13;
disbursements on works expenditures, withdrawals from the Bank and CESDF Loans and the&#13;
Government Account may either be effected simultaneously to cover the total works expenditure&#13;
presented for payment, or advanced in full by the Government and reimbursed subsequently by&#13;
the Bank and the CESDF into the Government account.&#13;
3.17 Accounting and Auditing. The GDHRF and the CPCU will set up project accounts and&#13;
financial records for all project-related expenditures. All these accounts and records would be&#13;
maintained in conformity with accepted international accounting practices. The Special Account&#13;
and the Project Account, will be audited in accordance with the Bank Guidelines. Financial&#13;
Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank (March 1982). The CPCU will&#13;
provide the Bank, within six months of the end of each Government fiscal year, with an audit&#13;
report of such scope and detail as the Bank may reasonably request, including a separate opinion&#13;
by the auditor on disbursements against certified SOEs. The separate opinion should mention&#13;
whether the SOEs submitted during the fiscal year, together with the procedures and internal&#13;
control involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawal&#13;
applications. . The services of the independent auditor are financed under the project.&#13;
G. SUPERVISION AND MONITORING&#13;
3.18  Progress Repo. The CPCU will prepare semi-annual progress reports (beginning from&#13;
the date of Loan Effectiveness) on each project component, objective and activity. These reports&#13;
will describe: (a) current status and issues; (b) deviations, if any, from the implementation plan&#13;
and project targets; and (c) recommendations for actions and forward planning. The Monitoring&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
Indicators shown in Annex 7 would be used to keep track of project performance, and the&#13;
achievements with respect to these indicators would be reflected by the CPCU in the semi-annual&#13;
progress reports. These Monitoring Indicators would be reviewed periodically by the&#13;
Government and the Bank during Bank supervision missions to ascertain their continued&#13;
relevance as tools for measuring and/or tracking project performance, targets and objectives,&#13;
and/or whether modifications in the list of indicators are necessary. The format prescribed by the&#13;
Bank for reporting on the progress of school rehabilitation activities and expenditures would also&#13;
be used by the CPCU in reporting to the CESDF.&#13;
3.19 Midtern Review and Evaluation. By April 30, 2000, the CPCU will undertake jointly&#13;
with the Bank a mid-term review of progress in project implementation to determine whether: (a)&#13;
the project's intended objectives remain valid; (b) implementation is advancing satisfactorily to&#13;
justify its continued implementation; and (c) any adjustments to, or significant restructuring of,&#13;
the project are necessary to improve its effectiveness&#13;
3.20 During Negotiations, thie Government provided assurances that it would: (a) maintain&#13;
policies and procedures adequate to enable it to monitor and evaluate on an ongoing basis, in&#13;
accordance withl indicators acceptable to the Bank, the carrying out of the project and the&#13;
achievement of its objective; (b) prepare, under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank,&#13;
andfurnish the Bank, on or about April 30, 2000, a report integrating tlle results of the&#13;
monitoring activities on the progress achieved in carrying out the project during the period&#13;
preceding the date of the report, and setting out the measures recommended to ensure the&#13;
efficient carrying out of the project and the achievement of its objectives; and (c) review with&#13;
the Bank, by August 31, 2000, the report, and, thereafter, take all measures required to ensure&#13;
the efficient completion of the project and the achievement of its objectives, based on thle&#13;
conclusions and recommendations of the report and the Bank views on thie matter.&#13;
3.21  Project Completion and Evaluation. The five-year project implementation is expected to&#13;
be completed by July 31, 2002, and the Loan Account closed by January 31, 2003. The CPCU&#13;
will be responsible for preparing a Project Implementation Completion Report to be submitted to&#13;
the Bank no later than six months after the Loan Closing Date, by July 31, 2003.&#13;
3.22  Bank Superyisin. The project will require intensive supervision (30 staff weeks) during&#13;
the first two years of implementation to review the definition of scope of rehabilitation work for&#13;
project schools and the application of the methodologies, criteria and standards referred to in&#13;
paras 2.5 - 2.9). The basis of Bank supervision will be the semi-annual progress reports prepared&#13;
by the CPCU, the Monitoring Indicators (Annex 7) and the PIP. These will be supplemented by&#13;
Bank review of project expenditures and availability of financial resources, and discussions with&#13;
technical specialists implementing and/or assisting in the implementation of the project, as well&#13;
as with senior management of MOE and the Government. To the extent feasible, the Bank will&#13;
field joint supervision missions with the CESDF.&#13;

4. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
4.1   The main benefit of the project would be to eliminate the physical risk to almost 200,000&#13;
students occupying selected damaged schools. The investment would yield fiscal savings by: (a)&#13;
rehabilitating damaged schools now rather than at some future date when buildings are further&#13;
damaged or totally collapsed; and, (b) by consolidating under-utilized schools operating in the&#13;
same catchment area. Rehabilitated schools would be built to conform with the pedagogic and&#13;
safety standards established by the MOE, which are consistent with international norms. As&#13;
such, project benefits include the improvements in learning and earning, difficult to quantify, but&#13;
in light of growing evidence from other countries likely to obtain from reduced over-crowding in&#13;
the damaged schools. By rehabilitating damaged schools, the majority (about 80 percent) of&#13;
which are in rural areas, the project would help improve educational status in rural areas and&#13;
alleviate one of the main causes of poverty in Romania. The investment program itself would&#13;
provide economic benefits to the local construction industry and the immediate surrounding&#13;
population. Finally, the project would improve the capacity and economic planning of the MOE,&#13;
and as such develop institutional capacity of the Government to implement such programs&#13;
efficiently in the future.&#13;
B. RISKS&#13;
4.2   There are no major risks to the project, but there are three areas where possible difficulties&#13;
could arise: (a) in managerial capacity at the Judet level; (b) in the procurement process; and (c) in&#13;
the timeliness of the release of Government counterpart resources. First, the scope of work in the&#13;
more disadvantaged Judets (which also have the highest number of damaged schools), may extend&#13;
beyond the implementation capacity in these Judets. Second, the procurement procedures to be&#13;
used under the project are significantly different from the local processes with which the MOE and&#13;
the Judets are familiar. Third, local procedures for funding allocations and disbursements are&#13;
cumbersome. Works contractors are very dependent of timely fund flows for efficient contract&#13;
execution. Delays in the actual release of counterpart funds could cause critical construction delays&#13;
(or even work stoppage by small building contractors). These areas of difficulty could delay school&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
rehabilitation, and increase the risk of serious physical injury to school occupants. Implementation&#13;
delays would adversely affect schooling in the affected areas, and trigger cost overruns.&#13;
4.3   The project includes measures to mitigate these potential difficulties. The strengthening of&#13;
the CPCU and all DPIUs with technical expertise would address the deficiency in management.&#13;
The establishment of these units in the mainstream of MOE and district operations will build the&#13;
capacity to manage future rehabilitation programs. Training of MOE staff in implementation&#13;
procedures (procurement, disbursement of Loan and counterpart funds, and monitoring of&#13;
contractor performance) will accelerate decision making processes and assure a timely&#13;
implementation of the project. Project size and implementation time have been carefully linked&#13;
with resource flows and the availability of counterpart fumds.&#13;

5. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
Agreements Reached at Negotiations&#13;
5.4    During Negotiations, the Government provided assurances that it would:&#13;
(a)   follow the criteria and procedures, and the design standards agreed with the Bank,&#13;
with respect to: (i) the rehabilitation, upgrading and furnishing of the schools&#13;
under the project; and (ii) the prioritization of the rehabilitation of such schools&#13;
(para 2.1 1 (a));&#13;
(b)   submit to the Bank, for its approval, any proposed modifications to said criteria,&#13;
procedures and standards before such modifications are introduced (para 2.1 1 (b));&#13;
(c)   (i) by April 30, 2000, submit to the Bank, for its review, a draft study with&#13;
recommendations on alternative efficient allocation methods for pre-university&#13;
school maintenance expenditures; (ii) immediately thereafter finalize said study&#13;
taking into consideration the Bank's comments on its draft; and (iii) carry out the&#13;
recommendations of the study in accordance with their terms (para 2.13);&#13;
(d)   ensure that every fiscal year, starting in 2001, adequate budgetary resources are&#13;
allocated to allow adequate maintenance of the schools rehabilitated, upgraded&#13;
and furnished under the project (para 2.29(a));&#13;
(e)   ensure that such budgetary allocations are utilized for their intended purpose (para&#13;
2.29(b));&#13;
(f)    maintain policies and procedures adequate to enable it to monitor and evaluate on&#13;
an ongoing basis, in accordance with indicators acceptable to the Bank, the&#13;
carrying out of the project and the achievement of its objective (para 3.20(a));&#13;
(g)   prepate, under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, by April 30, 2000, a&#13;
report integrating the results of the monitoring activities on the progress achieved&#13;
in carrying out the project during the period preceding the date of the report, and&#13;
setting out the measures recommended to ensure the efficient carrying out of the&#13;
project and the achievement of its objectives (para 3.20(b)); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
(h)   review with the Bank, by August 31, 2000, the report, and thereafter take all&#13;
measures required to ensure the efficient completion of the project and the&#13;
achievement of its objectives, based on the conclusions and recommendations of&#13;
the report and the Bank views on the matter (para 3.20(c)).&#13;
Condition of Effectiveness&#13;
5.5    As an additional condition of effectiveness of the Bank Loan, all conditions to the&#13;
effectiveness of the CESDF Loan must be fulfilled (para 3.3).&#13;
Recommendation&#13;
5.6   Subject to the above, the proposed operation would provide a suitable basis for a Loan of&#13;
US$70.0 million equivalent to Romania.&#13;

SCHOOL REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Design Standards for Rehabilitating Schools&#13;
1.   Introduction. The schools to be rehabilitated under the project were identified as the most&#13;
seriously damaged in the country, and the most likely to collapse without warning. Many of&#13;
these schools do not comply with Government building regulations concerning structural safety&#13;
(particularly seismic protection). Most of these schools also do not provide the appropriate&#13;
physical environment for learning that are prescribed in the MOE standards for pre-university&#13;
building facilities.&#13;
2.    The design and scope of rehabilitation interventions in these project schools would,&#13;
therefore, incorporate the minimum standards described in the following paragraphs. These&#13;
norms are explained in greater detail in the Project Implementation Plan.&#13;
Construction Standards:&#13;
3.    Structural Safty: All buildings to be rehabilitated will be structurally reinforced in order&#13;
to comply strictly with the latest provisions of the National Building Code, in particular, those&#13;
that pertain to the seismic resistance of the building structures.&#13;
4.    Materials and Construction Methods: No asbestos materials will be used in the&#13;
construction or rehabilitation of the schools. In the process of rehabilitation, appropriate&#13;
measures will be introduced in the construction contracts concerning the safe removal and&#13;
disposal, by the works contractors, of any asbestos materials found in the buildings to be&#13;
rehabilitated.&#13;
Student Capacity:&#13;
5.    The sizes (student capacity) of all school facilities situated in urban areas as well as in the&#13;
larger rural communities will be designed in such a manner that the total school enrollment can&#13;
be accommodated into two shifts. As a rule, classrooms in primary and secondary levels, will be&#13;
designed to seat 30-35 students. Kindergarten classrooms should normally accommodate 20-25&#13;
students. The average dimensions of these classrooms (i.e. square meters of floor area per&#13;
student) will be in accordance with the norms described in detail in the Project Implementation&#13;
Plan&#13;
6.    Schools in isolated/remote rural areas, where students have to commute longer or farther&#13;
distances than normal in order to attend classes, may be designed to accommodate only one shift.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX2&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
7.    In schools with low enrollments or where there are less than 10 pupils enrolled in most&#13;
grade levels, it is uneconomical to provide separate classrooms for each grade level. In such&#13;
instances, the sizes of the classrooms will be designed for multi-grade teaching (i.e. where only&#13;
one teacher attends simultaneously to students of several grade levels within the confines of one&#13;
teaching space).&#13;
Amenities:&#13;
8.    Because of resource constraints, the extent of the rehabilitation and upgrading work done&#13;
on the project schools will be confined so as to provide only the basic educational enviromnent&#13;
to support the pedagogical objectives of the Education Reform Program, and provide the&#13;
minimum acceptable levels of comfort to the school occupants (students and teachers). The&#13;
amenities to be provided (if not available) and upgraded in the affected schools are the following:&#13;
Academic facilities:&#13;
appropriate number of classrooms and general purpose laboratories&#13;
faculty room and administrative space&#13;
library with a small reading area&#13;
all classrooms will be furnished in order to provide seating for all students&#13;
Utilities/Other Features:&#13;
sanitary facilities for students and teachers&#13;
appropriate waste/sewage disposal&#13;
drinking water&#13;
heating:     central heating units for larger schools&#13;
room/space heating units for smaller facilities&#13;
electricity (also in remote rural areas if available)&#13;
fire protection and emergency escapes&#13;
access facilitated for disabled students&#13;
security measures (as appropriate to protect loss of property)&#13;
Other Building Rehabilitation Norms Under the Project:&#13;
9.    Size of Building Rehabilitated. The actual dimensions (gross building areas) of some&#13;
schools identified for rehabilitation, are exceedingly larger than the space which should&#13;
normally/reasonably be provided (after applying the MOE standards for unit areas per type of&#13;
teaching space) to accommodate the existing school enrollment, with the appropriate number of&#13;
shifts having already been taken into account. In such cases, the scope of the rehabilitation work&#13;
on the affected school should not extend beyond this normal/reasonable building area, and cover&#13;
the entire building structure, without justifiable reasons for doing so. The approval of the School&#13;
Rehabilitation Board should be sought if the building area proposed for rehabilitation will exceed&#13;
the norm for building size appropriate for the enrollment capacity, before building designs are&#13;
prepared, and any investment funds are committed for rehabilitating such a school.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
10.   Consolidation of School Buildings. There are cases wherein, within the catchment area&#13;
of the school identified for rehabilitation, are found other similar schools which will influence&#13;
the student intake, and therefore, the size (or continued existence) of the affected school. In&#13;
such situations, the appropriate scope of rehabilitation work should be determined using the&#13;
economic analysis described in Annex 2 of this Staff Appraisal Report. In brief, the possible&#13;
school rehabilitation alternatives are to: (a) close the affected/damaged school and rehabilitate or&#13;
upgrade the adjacent school(s) such that these can adequately house the students of the damaged&#13;
school to be closed; (b) consolidate the affected school with the adjacent school(s) and&#13;
accommodate the students of the adjacent school(s) by expanding the affected school's capacity;&#13;
or (c) limit the rehabilitation of the affected school to a school size that will accommodate only&#13;
the students who have remained in the facility (if some have been displaced by the damage to the&#13;
facility), and upgrade the facilities of the adjacent school(s) which absorbed students evacuated&#13;
from the affected school. In any case, the appropriate rehabilitation options should be cleared&#13;
with the School Rehabilitation Board before these are adopted.&#13;
11.   Exclusions from Project Financing: Because of resource limitations, the following types&#13;
of interventions will not be included for financing under the project:&#13;
rehabilitation of student boarding areas&#13;
rehabilitation of indoor sports facilities (e.g. gyms)&#13;
rehabilitation of school auditoriums for large congregations/cultural activities&#13;
rehabilitation of vocational/industrial workshops&#13;
provision of pedagogical equipment (e.g. laboratory/office equipment)&#13;
installation/rehabilitation of air-conditioning systems&#13;
installation of telephone/telecommunication systems&#13;
12.   For the sequencing exercise, estimates of the rehabilitation costs of the 900 damaged&#13;
schools and or replacement costs of the facilities if the buildings have been condemned due to&#13;
major structural defects, were prepared in the following manner:&#13;
(a)    Rehabilitation and Construction Costs:&#13;
(i)    Rehabilitation costs were based on a unit cost of US$200 per square meter&#13;
of building area to be repaired. This unit cost was increased by 1O percent&#13;
(to US$220 per sq. m.) to take into account any interior wall repartitioning&#13;
or similar interior remodeling that may be required. Thus the total&#13;
rehabilitation cost of a damaged school is equal to the gross existing floor&#13;
area of the school (aggregate areas of all floor levels), multiplied by the&#13;
unit rehabilitation cost.&#13;
(ii)   Costs of new construction (or building extensions to the existing facility)&#13;
were estimated on the basis of US$400 per square meter of new building&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX2&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
area. As in item 1 above, the total cost of new construction or an&#13;
extension wing to an existing building is equal to the gross existing floor&#13;
area of the building multiplied by the unit cost for new construction.&#13;
(b)   Floor Areas of School Buildings: In estimating the costs of building&#13;
rehabilitation, the floor areas were considered in the following manner:&#13;
(i)   using the existing floor area (EFA) as basis of the scope of work;&#13;
(ii)   using the required floor area (RFA). The RFA results from applying the&#13;
MOE school design norms to determine the appropriate size of a school of&#13;
a given enrollment. The RFA is a function of the number of classrooms&#13;
(including laboratories) needed to accommodate the total school&#13;
enrollment either in one or 2 shifts. The RFA aggregates the surface areas&#13;
of all other rooms/spaces associated with the classrooms and laboratories&#13;
(i.e. corridors, toilets, core faculty and administrative spaces, utility rooms,&#13;
etc.) necessary for a school to function in accordance with MOE's&#13;
minimum pedagogical standards.&#13;
(iii)  adjusted floor area (AFA). This results from adjusting the EFA of the&#13;
damaged school, to approximate the RFA as closely as possible. The&#13;
existing buildings proposed for rehabilitation could either be: too small to&#13;
adequately accommodate the enrollment; much larger than what is&#13;
considered appropriate for the enrollment, or just adequate for the needs of&#13;
the school when compared with the RFA resulting from the application of&#13;
the MOE school design standards:&#13;
13.   In the first case (too small), the school building has to be expanded. The rehabilitation&#13;
cost is, therefore, the sum of the rehabilitation cost (EFA x unit rehabilitation cost) plus the cost&#13;
of the new spaces ((RFA-EFA) x unit cost of new construction).&#13;
14.   In the second case (larger than needed), the scope of rehabilitation work will be confined&#13;
only to upgrading the space needed to accommodate the enrollment. In practice, this procedure&#13;
should be used judiciously, the key element being the preparation of a good architectural plan for&#13;
rehabilitating the school. The scope of work on the existing building would therefore be&#13;
confined to rehabilitate a floor area not to exceed 15 percent of the RFA.&#13;
15.   In schools where the existing floor area of the damaged building falls within 15 percent&#13;
above the RFA, the total EFA may be rehabilitated.&#13;

Preparation of Preliminary Cost Estimates for Sequencing Rehabilitation of Schools&#13;
16.   For purposes of estimating rehabilitation costs of each school for prioritizing/sequencing&#13;
the rehabilitation activities, the following aspects should be taken into account:&#13;
(a)   the application of the unit construction costs for new buildings (or extensions to&#13;
existing ones) or for rehabilitating existing facilities as described in Annex 5;&#13;
(b)   the application of MOE pedagogical and safety standards for planning and&#13;
designing pre-university facilities, consistent with the provisions of Romania's&#13;
Education Reform Program. The relevant standards are described in detail in the&#13;
Project Implementation Plan, and they pertain to: (i) the basic (minimum set)&#13;
types and number of teaching facilities (classrooms, laboratories, etc.) and utilities&#13;
(sanitation, heating, water, etc.) to be provided each school rehabilitated under the&#13;
project; (ii) the school level (i.e. kindergarten, primary, secondary) and&#13;
enrollment. Each type of school has an appropriate set of optimum net and gross&#13;
accommodation areas (square meters) for each type of teaching and environment&#13;
and related spaces. The building areas are commensurate with the planned&#13;
capacity of the school; (iii) conformity with the minimum structural requirements&#13;
provided in the latest edition of Romania's National Building Code, in particular,&#13;
structural provisions for seismic reinforcement;&#13;
(c)   the use of appropriate building technology and readily available construction&#13;
materials;&#13;
(d)    all schools capacities would be designed to accommodate the total student&#13;
enrollment in two shifts. In small schools which have less than five students&#13;
enrolled in a grade level, classrooms would be designed for multi-grade teaching&#13;
(i.e. accommodating two or more levels in simultaneous classes under one&#13;
teacher);&#13;
(e)    the scope of work under the project will be subject to the following limitations;&#13;
(i)   the scope of work will exclude the rehabilitation of student boarding&#13;
places (dormitories) and vocational workshops;&#13;
(ii)   all schools will be provided with basic furniture (student and teacher&#13;
desks) in quantities sufficient to seat all students in the classrooms and&#13;
laboratories (In some cases, this could mean supplying all the furniture to&#13;
schools which have none or no serviceable units. An inventory of&#13;
furniture in all schools will be conducted during project implementation to&#13;
determine the appropriate quantities/types to be provided to each facility).&#13;
&#13;

17.   Procedure for estimating rehabilitation costs. The steps to be taken are the following:&#13;
(a)    Based on the results of the school mapping exercise, determine what is the most&#13;
viable option for rehabilitating the damaged school under consideration (SAR&#13;
para 2.6), i.e., whether: (i) for an isolated school: (1) to strengthen, or depending&#13;
on the technical considerations, completely rebuild the damaged school; and (2)&#13;
expand the damaged school to relieve overcrowding; and (b) for schools with&#13;
similar schools in the same catchment area: in addition to (1) and (2) above, a&#13;
consideration of: (3) the closure of the damaged school as a result of consolidation&#13;
with expanded (if needed) adjacent schools; or (4) the consolidation of area&#13;
schools with the rehabilitated and expanded (if needed) damaged school.&#13;
(b)    Determine the appropriate student capacity of the school. The planned capacity of&#13;
the school for rehabilitation/upgrading purposes, as a general rule, should be the&#13;
current total enrollment divided by two (for a maximum 2 shifts). The school&#13;
capacity may be adjusted to take into account the average class sizes provided&#13;
under the Education Reform Program (and the Education Law).&#13;
(c)    The optimum size (gross building area) and configuration (number of classrooms&#13;
and related facilities) of the school under consideration would be determined&#13;
using the planned student capacity resulting from the calculation under para 17(b),&#13;
and applying the prescribed design standards (para 16(b)). This optimum school&#13;
size will then be compared with the existing building area of the school (prior to&#13;
rehabilitation):&#13;
(i)   if the existing size (square meters) is less than the optimum size, the&#13;
school would be expanded up to the optimum size, in addition to the&#13;
building rehabilitation needed, applying the units costs (para 16 above) for&#13;
new and rehabilitated construction;&#13;
(ii)   if the existing building size is substantially larger than the optimum size&#13;
(i.e. more than 20 percent above the optimum), the rehabilitation work&#13;
should be limited to a building area no more than 20 percent above the&#13;
optimum school size, applying the unit costs for rehabilitating existing&#13;
structures. The 20 percent contingency in the building area to be&#13;
rehabilitated is deemed more than sufficient to cover any type of interior&#13;
repartitioning or adjustment needed that will ultimately result in a well&#13;
functioning rehabilitated educational facility.&#13;

SCHOOL REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 3A: METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE SCOPE OF REHABILITATION EFFORTS&#13;
1.    In this section, cost benefit analysis will be used to evaluate the scope of the school&#13;
rehabilitation efforts. The analysis will be used to determine whether a particular damaged school&#13;
should be (i) rehabilitated (ii) rehabilitated and expanded to relieve crowding or (iii) consolidated&#13;
with an adjacent school. The benefits of each option are expressed in terms of the fiscal savings&#13;
obtained from undertaking each option relative to the base case scenario of 'do nothing now and&#13;
rehabilitate the school to its current structure' when it is totally collapsed.&#13;
2.    One way to evaluate the financial viability of alternate projects is to weigh the present&#13;
value of the stream of project benefits against project costs over the life of the project.&#13;
Formally, the net present value (NPV) of a project is given by:&#13;
NPV= E T=o (B,-Co)/(l+i)'&#13;
3.    Where i= interest rate and t:=0..T is the life of the project in years. In general capital&#13;
investment is assumed to occur in the first year(t=0) and benefits start to accrue in the second&#13;
year onward (t=1 ..T). The internal rate of return, IRR, of a project is given by the interest rate, I,&#13;
at which the NPV=0. In this formulation, each lei of benefit in the future is discounted to the&#13;
present by the rate of interest. That is, if the rate of interest is 10%, then 1000 lei today (year 0) is&#13;
worth 1000(1+. 10) lei tomorrow (in year 1). Similarly, 1000 lei benefit received tomorrow (in&#13;
year t=l) is worth 1000/(1.10) lei today, (in year in t=0). Projects with the highest IRR or NPV&#13;
would be the preferred options.&#13;
The costs and benefits used in this section do not reflect true costs but are fictional&#13;
numbers used to illustrate the methodology for using this economic method to determine the&#13;
scope of rehabilitation efforts. The examples were obtained from discussions with the MOE and&#13;
from visits to damaged schools in the Vaslui County. Initial results from the application of this&#13;
methodology to damaged schools in the pilot district of Tulcea is attached in the following&#13;
Annex 2B.&#13;
Example 1&#13;
4     Suppose there are two primary schools within 1 km distance (easy access) of each other.&#13;
The damaged primary school (70% damaged) is running 1 shift per day. It has 25 students, 4&#13;
teachers, 1 principal, 1 clerical staff, and 3 classrooms. The adjacent undamaged school is&#13;
running 1 shift per day and has 1 classroom, 1 teacher, 1 principal, and 11 students. We assume&#13;
that the annual wage of each teacher is 3 m. lei and the salary of a principal is 5 m lei. There is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
AvNNEX 3A&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
room to expand the adjacent school and there is space for constructing a new school on the site of&#13;
the damaged school.&#13;
5.    The range of options include: (A) do nothing, (B) rehabilitate the damaged school and&#13;
maintain two separate schools; (C) expand the adjacent school and close down the damaged&#13;
school; and (D) close down both existing schools and build a new, expanded school in place of&#13;
the damaged school.&#13;
6.    The hypothetical recurrent and capital costs of all options (in m. lei) are summarized in&#13;
Table I below:&#13;

*in year t=2 to reconstruct totally collapsed school&#13;
5.    Suppose capital costs are undertaken in year zero and assume a 25 year lifetime for&#13;
construction. Assume fixed interest rate (10%) and fixed nominal costs over the life of the&#13;
project.I The first benefit of options B, C, D over option A is the reduction in recurrent costs&#13;
over the life of the project. These are 2 m lei for option B, and 20 m lei for options C and D&#13;
respectively. The second benefit of options B, C, D over option A is the reduction in capital costs&#13;
of having to construct a completely new school in the third year (year t=2) when the damaged&#13;
school is assumed to collapse completely. The costs of options B, C, D are the incremental&#13;
capital costs of rehabilitating the damaged school, expanding one school, and constructing a new&#13;
school respectively. These are 500 m lei, 400 m lei and 800 m lei in the first year (or t=0)&#13;
respectively.&#13;
6.    The benefit cost stream for each option can be summarized in Table 2.&#13;
We assume private costs (uniforms, transport costs, etc.) remain the same across each option. We also&#13;
consider the value of saved lives would be the same for options B-D; but would tend to raise the NPV and IRR of&#13;
options B-D relative to A.&#13;

7.    The NPV is positive for all options relative to the 'do nothing option'. The IRR is higher&#13;
than 10% for all options. The most attractive option is option C, to expand the adjacent school in&#13;
order to consolidate two under-utilized schools. The least attractive (other than A) is to build a&#13;
completely new school.&#13;
Example 2.&#13;
8.    Now consider the case where the distance between two under-utilized schools is 5 km. In&#13;
this consolidating/expanding either school is not feasible. The options would be A, do nothing;&#13;
B, rehabilitate the damaged school; C , demolish the existing school and rebuild an entirely new&#13;
school.&#13;

stream of each option (see Table 5). Once again the incremental capital costs are 500 and 800 of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX3A&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
options B and C (relative to A). The benefits are a savings in recurrent costs of 2 m and 5 m lei&#13;
respectively and the saving in capital costs in year 3 (t=2). The IRR and NPV are as follows:&#13;
Option B                Option C&#13;
IRR            42%                     14%&#13;
NPV           345m lei               71 m lei&#13;
10.    In this case the most attractive option is to rehabilitate the damaged school.&#13;
Example 3&#13;
l .   Now suppose that under option B, rehabilitating the school would have a shorter life&#13;
span than option C (demolishing/rebuilding), and would require an injection of 400 m lei every&#13;
10 years (in year 1 0 and year 20). The benefit/cost stream for option C is identical to example 2,&#13;
option C. The benefit cost stream of option B is the same as in example 2, except that every 10&#13;
years benefits are reduced by 400 m lei. The cost/benefit streams of each option is provided in&#13;
Table 5. The NPV and IRR of options B and C relative to option A are as follows:&#13;
02tion B             Option C&#13;
IRR             3%                    14%&#13;
NPV             13m lei              71m lei&#13;
12.   Under these assumptions building a new school is the preferred option.&#13;
Example 4&#13;
13.    Suppose there are two schools with classes 1-8. These are located within (easy access) 1&#13;
km  of each other. One school is completely damaged and evacuated. The adjacent 1-8 class&#13;
school is crowded because it is accommodating students from the evacuated school. It is running&#13;
3 shifts and has 40 students/class, 400 students, 10 teachers, 1 principal, and 2 clerical staff. This&#13;
adjacent school is crowded. Therefore the options are A) do nothing; B) rehabilitate damaged&#13;
school and split the enrollment equally between the two schools C) expand adjacent school and&#13;
abandon damaged school and D) rehabilitate and expand damaged school for all students.2 The&#13;
recurrent and capital costs under each option are as follows:&#13;
2    We now add teachers to reduce the teacher to student ratio to 33 students/teacher. Thus, we increase the&#13;
number of teachers to 12 (split 6/6 under option B) under options B-D relative to options A. We assume that expansion&#13;
costs increase classrooms to reduce students per class to the optimal ratio and reduce shifts per day in all options to 2&#13;
per day.&#13;

14.   The NPV and IRR of each option (B-D) are lower than option A, the 'do nothing case'.&#13;
This is because the recurrent costs and investment costs are higher for options B-D relative to&#13;
option A. However, the benefits from option B-D are only financial and are an underestimate of&#13;
project benefits because the beneficial impact of crowding on the learning environment is not&#13;
taken into account. The benefits of reduced crowding are difficult to quantify. In practice we&#13;
would have to either find a quantitative relationship between crowded schools and repetition or&#13;
drop out rates from data collected for the economic analysis/school mapping exercise, or assume&#13;
that there is such a positive relationship as shown in studies from other countries in order to&#13;
quantify the benefits from reduced crowding.&#13;
15.   Assume for now that the benefits from reduced crowding make options B-D more&#13;
attractive than A. We also assume that reduced crowding results in equal benefits for options B-&#13;
D (vs. A). Since all options are considered attractive relative to A, we can base our decision on a&#13;
comparison of options C and D relative to B. The benefits of options in C and D (relative to B)&#13;
would be savings in recurrent cost from consolidating damaged schools. (12m lei over the life of&#13;
the project for option C and option D). The year one (t=0) capital costs of option C (relative to B)&#13;
are 50 m lei while the year I (t=0) capital costs of option D are 100 m lei. The benefit/cost&#13;
stream for these options is provided in Table 5. Under these assumptions, the IRR and NPV of&#13;
options C and D (relative to B) is as follows:&#13;
Option C             Option D&#13;
IRR          24%                    11%&#13;
NPV         60m lei               9m lei&#13;
16.   Thus, option C, expanding the adjacent crowded school rather than rehabilitating and&#13;
expanding the damaged school would be the preferred rehabilitation option.&#13;

SCHOOL REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 3B: DETERMINING THE SCOPE OF REHABILITATION EFFORTS: RESULTS&#13;
1.    The cost-benefit analysis is applied to selected schools in the pilot district of Tulcea. The&#13;
examples described below were completed by the MOE affiliated Institute of Education&#13;
economists Comelia and Andre Novak, members of the School Rehabilitation Working Group.&#13;
The pedagogic and facility standards used in this exercise are based on norms established by the&#13;
MOE in accordance with the recent Education Law. There is one exception. The number of&#13;
teachers are still based on the current MOE standards for teaching norms per class. Changes in&#13;
this norm to reflect the revision of the secondary school curriculum, should this occur over the&#13;
project cycle, will be reflected in future decisions on project scope. One other caveat. The Tulcea&#13;
pilot district did not contain any schools that could potentially be consolidated with other&#13;
schools. Therefore, the consolidation exercise presented in section C below is based on a&#13;
hypothetical situation to illustrate the methods that would be used when and if school&#13;
consolidation is a feasible option. The assumptions used in this analysis are described in Section&#13;
A Table 1-3 below. An assessment of the area of the replaced or rehabilitated school, determined&#13;
according to the new facilities norms, is described in Annex 2.&#13;

SECTION B: SIMULATION RESULTS FROM THE PILOT DISTRICT OF TULCEA&#13;
A. AN ISOLATED UN-CROWDED SCHOOL&#13;
2.    This damaged multi-grade rural primary school (classes 1-4) enrolls 36 students is&#13;
isolated, a common situation in Tulcea where many villages are separated by the waters of the&#13;
Danube Delta. The 5 classes and 450 sq. m of the school area is under-utilized. The calculated&#13;
shifts, the ratio of number of classrooms to the required number of classes is only .4, far less than&#13;
the two calculated shifts prescribed by the MOE. According to the new pedagogic and facilities&#13;
norms, a new school should only consist of 2 classrooms of 70 sq. m. each with an additional 40&#13;
sq. m of other basic facilities, for a total school area of 180 sq. m. If the school is rehabilitated,&#13;
rather than completely replaced, an additional 20 percent of the 180 sq. m. of the prescribed area,&#13;
is added to provide a comfortable margin of error given the difficulty of predicting the new,&#13;
down-sized and re-configured, school area.&#13;
3.    Three scenarios are considered in rehabilitating this school:&#13;
(a)   Do nothing now and replace the school with a new facility of 450 sq.m. in 2 years.&#13;
(b)   Replace the school with a building with 2 classrooms covering 180 sq.m. now.&#13;
(c)   Rehabilitate the school area for 2 classes (660 sq.m.) now.&#13;
4.    The parameters of the school and the difference in maintenance and recurrent costs&#13;
between scenario A and B; and A and C, both before and after the rehabilitation, are outlined in&#13;
Table 5 below (following page). The results of the IRR and NPV calculations show that&#13;
rehabilitating the damaged school now (as in Option C) is the preferred option and yields a 127&#13;
percent Internal Rate of Return (relative to option A).&#13;

B. AN ISOLATED CROWDED SCHOOL&#13;
5.    This isolated rural primary and secondary school has 156 students with 10 classes&#13;
crowded in only 4 classrooms. The school is operating in two shifts, but in sub-optimal learning&#13;
conditions. The number of calculated shifts, the ratio of classrooms to classes, is greater than the&#13;
two, thus two classes are being taught in one classroom during the school day. The school will&#13;
need to be extended by one classroom so that the number of calculated shifts can be reduced to&#13;
the two prescribed in the new pedagogic standards. The current size of the school far exceeds the&#13;
requirements of a 5 classroom school. The optimal size for a new 5 classroom school is&#13;
approximately 550 sq. m, while the estimated area for a rehabilitated school is about 20% more,&#13;
about 660 sq.m. Three rehabilitation options are considered:&#13;
(a)    Do nothing now. Replace the school facilities with a building with 5 classrooms&#13;
and the same sq. m. area after it is collapsed.&#13;
(b)   Replace the school facilities with a building with 5 classrooms covering 550 sq.m.&#13;
(c)    Rehabilitate the school area for 5 classrooms (660 sq.m.).&#13;
&#13;

C. A CONSOLIDATION OF NEIGHBORING SCHOOLS&#13;
7.    The commune of Casimcea, in the district of Tulcea, has a group of 2 neighboring units&#13;
(units 10 and I1) within the stipulated distance from the village that are both running in a single&#13;
shift. Unit 11 is under-utilized. Four classrooms in the school are not used during the school day.&#13;
According to the new facilities standards, the 1655 sq. m. area of the building is too large relative&#13;
to the recommended building area (840 sq. m) for a new school, comprising the same levels,&#13;
classes and students as Unit 10. Rehabilitating Unit 10 is also estimated to use only 1008 sq. m.,&#13;
well below the current area occupied by this school. The neighboring (non-damaged) unit (11) is&#13;
a multi-grade school with only 9 students. These schools are within an easy commute of each&#13;
other and therefore possible to consolidate. The distribution of classes, students, teachers and&#13;
teaching norms per school in each school are presented in Tables 3 and 4 below. It should be&#13;
noted that this is a simulation only. Although the information on each school is real, all schools&#13;
in Tulcea are isolated and cannot be consolidated&#13;

8.    The information on school parameters presented in Table 5 indicates the students from&#13;
Unit 11 can easily be consolidated into a rehabilitated Unit 10. The 12 classrooms of a&#13;
rehabilitated or completely replaced Unit 11 will accommodate the students of the combined&#13;
schools in a single shift. The total number of classes operating in both schools will decrease from&#13;
the current total of 13 to a total of 12 classes in the combined school. The consolidation of both&#13;
schools will reduce the number of teaching norms, from the current 15.5 to 14.5. The alternate&#13;
scenario, of consolidating both schools in unit 11 is also possible, but only by extending Unit 11&#13;
to a 6 classroom school covering 570 sq. m. The 6 classrooms will be used in two shifts to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX3B&#13;
Page 7 of 8&#13;
accommodate the 12 consolidated classes. The first 3 kindergarten classes (3 classrooms) and the&#13;
3 primary school classes (3 classrooms) will be taught in the first shift. The second shift will be&#13;
composed of 2 primary classes (2 classrooms) and 4 gymnasium classes (4 classrooms). Three&#13;
scenarios are considered:&#13;
(a)   Do not rehabilitate Unit 10 now. Replace the school (1655 sq. m.) after it&#13;
collapses.&#13;
(b)   Rehabilitate Unit 10 now (to 12 classes and 1008 sq.m.) and maintain both units.&#13;
(c)   Rehabilitate Unit 10 now and consolidate Unit 11 with Unit 10.&#13;
(d)   Do not Rehabilitate Unit 10. Consolidate Unit 10 into an expanded unit 11 now.&#13;
9.    The costs of the alternate scenarios describe above are provided in Table 6 below. The&#13;
results show that consolidating all students of Unit 10 into an extended Unit 11 yields highest&#13;
internal rate of return (relative to A) of all considered options.&#13;

SCHOOL REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
PRIORITIZING SCHOOLS FOR REHABILITATION:&#13;
RANKING METHOD AND SIMULATION RESULTS&#13;
1.    The objective of the school rehabilitation project is to rehabilitate about 900 severely&#13;
damaged pre-university schools which have been found to be in immninent danger of collapse, in&#13;
order to safeguard the lives of school occupants. The schools would be rehabilitated in such a&#13;
manner that these facilities would meet national safety and pedagogic standards established&#13;
consistent with the Government's Education Reform Program.&#13;
2.    The prioritization of rehabilitation efforts will be required because (a) particular school&#13;
buildings may collapse over the lifetime of the project and result in a loss of student/teacher&#13;
lives; and (b) resources allocated for the rehabilitation for all the 900 schools may fall short of&#13;
actual requirements. School rehabilitation efforts will be prioritized in two stages. The first phase&#13;
will present the optimal ranking from a theoretical point of view. The second phase will adapt the&#13;
theoretical ranking to more practical project implementation concerns. The method of&#13;
prioritization is consistent with the major objectives of the project and simple to use.&#13;
The First Stage of Prioritization&#13;
3.    Ranking Method, In the first stage, all schools will be ranked, in ascending order, by the&#13;
benefit-cost ratio of rehabilitating each school. The benefits of the project are to improve the&#13;
quality of education in accordance with the pedagogic and safety norms for pre-university&#13;
education established by the country. For sequencing purposes, the benefit-cost ratio will be&#13;
approximated by the major benefit of the rehabilitating each school the value of lives saved in&#13;
each school per total cost of rehabilitating each school. More formally, the benefit of&#13;
rehabilitating each school, B, can be expressed as the product of the value of each life saved, k,&#13;
and the number (expected value) of lives saved by rehabilitating each school. The number of&#13;
lives saved by rehabilitating each school is not known for certain. It depends on e, the number of&#13;
students enrolled/shift in each school and the probability associated with two separate events: (i)&#13;
pl, the probability that the damaged building will collapse and (ii) p2, the probability that&#13;
students are in school when the school collapses. Thus, the benefit, B, is given by kplp2e, and&#13;
B/C, the benefit-cost ratio for each school is:&#13;
B/C=[kplp2e] /C                             (1)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX4&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
4     Estimation of Variables. The estimation of e, the number of students/shift, is&#13;
straightforward and readily available from existing data. The probability that students are in&#13;
school when the building collapses, p2, can also be approximated as the proportion of a day (24&#13;
hours) that each school is in session. That is,: p2=[number of shifts/24]* [hours/shift]. The value&#13;
of life, k, can be ignored if we assume that k is the same for all individuals, that is, all individuals&#13;
have the same value of life. In this case, we can simply rank schools according to:&#13;
B/C=[plp2eJ/C                                  (2)&#13;
As suggested by the Government, we will attach a 10 percent higher value to rural areas,&#13;
reflective of a higher social value of rehabilitating schools in poor areas, by letting B/C =&#13;
[(I1.1 0)p I p2e]/C for rural schools.&#13;
5     The risk of collapse. (p 1). The risk of collapse of a particular school can be expressed as&#13;
the probability of an earthquake required to collapse a particular school One option would be to&#13;
determine, based on the damage to the school, the size of an earthquake needed to fell the&#13;
building. Then p 1 would be the probability of the occurrence of an earthquake of that level in the&#13;
area of the school. Alternately, pl could be estimated as the product of p3, the probability of&#13;
damage given an earthquake (approximated by the damage index for each school) and p4, the&#13;
probability of an earthquake in the area (approximated by the seismic index). In the extreme case,&#13;
where the damage index and seismic index cannot be established for each school, p I could be&#13;
assumed to be the same for all schools and equal to unity. This is not unreasonable as it can&#13;
safely be assumed that the selected schools are the most damaged in the country. In this case,&#13;
schools would be sequenced according to p2e/C.&#13;
6.    The actual costs. C, should ideally be based on (i) the existing physical and pedagogic&#13;
capacity of the building; (ii) the determination of the scope of rehabilitation according to&#13;
economic cost benefit analysis; and (iii) the pedagogic and safety norms to which the school is to&#13;
be rehabilitated. However, these costs will not be known at the time of sequencing. The cost of&#13;
rehabilitation for each school is therefore approximated as in Annex 2.&#13;
7.    Simulations: The exact distribution of schools by school characteristic (rural/urban,&#13;
number of enrolled, etc.) can only be determined once a value for pl has been established for all&#13;
damaged schools. However, in the absence of such a value, the ranking of schools can be&#13;
simulated by using the data on school type, location, students, shifts, school area, number of&#13;
classes, provided by the MOE. This data can be used to obtain an estimate of rehabilitation costs&#13;
and benefits for each school for alternate values of pl . The three simulations, attempted:&#13;
Sim. (a) The value of life is the same for each student. The risk of collapse, pl, is the&#13;
same for all schools and equal to unity.&#13;
Sim. (b) A higher value (5%) for rehabilitating rural vs. urban schools [ A higher&#13;
priority of 10% has been agreed however].This serves simply to illustrate a higher value&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX4&#13;
Page 3 of 8&#13;
assigned to rural vs. urban schools. The risk of collapse is the same for all schools. The&#13;
value of pl=l for all schools.&#13;
Sim. (c) The value of life is the same for each student. Rural schools are more likely to&#13;
collapse than urban schools. The value of p1=1 for rural schools and pl=.5 for urban&#13;
schools&#13;
8.    The ranking results from these simulations are presented in Tables 1-5 below. These&#13;
tables illustrate the rank distribution of schools by rural-urban area (Table 1), by total enrollment&#13;
(Table 2), and by Judet (Tables 3-5) for each of the simulations outlined above. The columns in&#13;
each table correspond to the results for the first 200 schools (column 1), the second 200 schools&#13;
(column 2), the third 200 schools (column 3), and the final 238 schools (column 4). The division&#13;
of schools into groups of 200 corresponds to the four year project cycle, with 200 schools&#13;
completed in each year.&#13;
9.    Simulation Ranking Results. The first result is that a 5% higher value of life in rural areas&#13;
(Sim (b)) does not make a large difference to school ranking as compared to Sim (a) which&#13;
assumes an equal value of life for all students. Second, assuming the same p for each school, the&#13;
schools rehabilitated in the first two years of the project would cover nearly 70% of the students&#13;
in all schools. The majority of the schools rehabilitated each year will be rural schools. The share&#13;
of rural schools in the total number of schools rehabilitated in each year will increase as the&#13;
project progresses. In contrast, the majority of urban schools would be rehabilitated in the first&#13;
two years of the project, with declining number of urban schools being rehabilitated in each&#13;
additional project year. Simulation (c), results in a more even distribution of students covered&#13;
over the project cycle. This result obtains because the higher probability of collapse assumed for&#13;
rural schools pushes these schools, which have a smaller enrollment than urban schools, higher&#13;
up in the ranking. This factor also serves to increase the proportion of rural schools in the total&#13;
schools to be rehabilitated in the first two years of the project.&#13;
These results show that the ranking process does not take into account practical concerns&#13;
of rehabilitating schools. The ranking scheme spaces out the rehabilitation of schools in the same&#13;
Judet unevenly across time. This creates diseconomies of scale in school construction,&#13;
particularly for Judets where only a few schools require rehabilitation. The sequencing algorithm&#13;
also does not take into account the construction or project administration capacity of each district&#13;
that may allow a greater/lesser number of schools to be constructed each year. Finally, the&#13;
sequencing method does not account for the need to construct attractive bidding package of&#13;
schools for rehabilitation in each district based on geographical proximity, type of rehabilitation,&#13;
and rural/urban location.&#13;
Second Stage of Prioritization&#13;
10.   Ranking Method In the second phase of prioritization, schools will be sequenced for&#13;
rehabilitation within each district (over time) and across districts (in any given year), taking into&#13;
account more practical concerns. In this phase, the first step will be the development of attractive&#13;
bidding packages of schools for rehabilitation. The composition of schools in each bidding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
package will take into account the geographic proximity, new/old, and urban/rural mix of&#13;
schools. The next step will be the prioritization of packages over the project cycle in each&#13;
district. This will be based on the benefit-cost ratio of each bidding package of schools according&#13;
to the sequencing methodology described above. Thus, if there are l...n schools in a particular&#13;
bidding package, the benefit-cost ratio of the package, consistent with Benefits and Costs&#13;
expressed as in equation (1), will be given by:&#13;
BplCp= [B(1)+...+B(n)]/[ C(1)+...+C(n)]                          (3)&#13;
The package with the higher Bp/Cp ratio would be accorded a higher priority.&#13;
The last step in the second phase of prioritization will be the determination of the number&#13;
of packages to be bid in each district in any year of the project according to the construction and&#13;
project administration capacity of the district. The rehabilitation of schools can prioritized by&#13;
districts in any given year, by the benefit cost ratio of the total number of bidding packages in&#13;
each district. Thus, if there are I...m package in a district in a particular year, the benefit-cost&#13;
ratio of the total number of bidding packag  in the district in that particular year is given by&#13;
Bd/Cd = [Bp(1)+...+Bp(m)]/[ Cp(l)+...+Cp(m)]                            (4)&#13;
In each year, the district with the higher Bd/Cd ratio would be accorded the higher&#13;
priority.&#13;

SCHOOL REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT COST ESTIMATES&#13;
1.    Total Project Cost. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$130.0 million&#13;
equivalent including contingencies, taxes and duties, with base costs estimated at about&#13;
US$106.5 million. Total contingencies (US$23.5 million) which represent 22 percent of&#13;
the base cost include: (a) physical contingencies of US$14.6 million; and (b) price&#13;
contingencies between project appraisal (March 1997) and completion at the end of the&#13;
five year project implementation period, estimated at US$8.9 million. The total foreign&#13;
exchange component (direct and indirect costs) of the project is calculated at US$21.7&#13;
million including contingencies, or 17 percent of total project cost. Project costs were&#13;
estimated as follows:&#13;
(a)   Base Costs. All unit and base costs estimates include local taxes and duties in&#13;
accordance with the rates described below in para l(d). Project costs have been&#13;
estimated in US Dollars due to the difficulty of predicting the exchange rate of the&#13;
Lei over the life of the project. The costs in Lei have been converted to US&#13;
Dollars at the official rate (7,030 Lei/US$ 1.00) prevailing at the time of&#13;
negotiations in June 1997. Base cost estimates were derived as follows: (i)&#13;
Building Construction costs were based on recent contracts awarded by the&#13;
Ministry of Education for the rehabilitation of facilities of the same type as the&#13;
project schools (see SAR para 2.14): (a) new construction (i.e. extensions or total&#13;
replacement of damaged buildings) is estimated at about US$400 per square meter&#13;
of building area; and (b) rehabilitation unit costs, because of the advance&#13;
deterioration of facilities, are estimated to range from 50 to 60 percent of the unit&#13;
cost of new buildings (i.e. US$200 to US$250 per square meter); (ii) Specialist&#13;
services: (a) eight percent of total building cost as fees for architectural and&#13;
engineering design services including construction supervision; (b) remuneration&#13;
of qualified national experts (technical experts/managers) at current market rates&#13;
for specialized services, ranging from US$250 to US$450 per staff-month; and (c)&#13;
cost of expatriate consultant services at US$20,000 per staff month (including&#13;
international travel, subsistence and accommodation in Romania); (iii) Training:&#13;
(a) US$8,000 per staff month for short-term training abroad (including training&#13;
and registration fees, inland travel and round trip air fare to country of study,&#13;
boarding and subsistence, allowance for training materials and books); and (b)&#13;
current Government rates for per diems, internal travel and estimates of training&#13;
material/consumable needs for the local training programs; and (iv) Maintenance:&#13;
1.5 percent of building rehabilitation cost for the costs of annual preventive&#13;
maintenance of buildings.&#13;
(b)   Contingency Allowances.(US$23.5 million aggregate) Project costs include: (i)&#13;
physical contingencies for unforeseen additions to the project scope (US$14.7&#13;
million) based on: (a) 15 percent of base costs for civil works and for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annrex5&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
architectural/engineering services; (b) five percent of base cost for furniture,&#13;
equipment, expatriate consulting services, and training; (c) 10 percent of base cost&#13;
for all other expenditure; and (ii) price contingencies (US$8.8 million) based on&#13;
annual rates of foreign price increases estimated at 2.3 percent from 1998-2002&#13;
for all categories of expenditure except for national consultants to benefit the&#13;
CPCU and the whose services would be contracted based on qualifications for the&#13;
assignment on a fixed budget basis; the national CPCU and DPIU specialists for&#13;
which no price contingency has been provided. Due to the large differential&#13;
between estimated local and foreign price increases, the overall price&#13;
contingencies for the project were calculated on the basis of foreign price&#13;
escalation rates. This approach would be based on the assumption that the Lei&#13;
exchange rate will reflect the inflation differential between Romania and its&#13;
international trading partners.&#13;
(c)    Foreign Exchange Component. (US$22.6 million equivalent) The foreign&#13;
exchange component of total project cost was estimated as follows: (i) 20 percent&#13;
of civil works costs; (ii) five percent of the cost of furniture, local training, and&#13;
architectural and engineering services; (iii) 100 percent for external training/study&#13;
tours; (v) 80 percent of the cost of external consulting services; and (vi) none for&#13;
local consulting services and building maintenance.&#13;
(d)    Taxes (US$23.4 million equivalent). Local taxes will be applied on all project&#13;
expenditure, including consulting services. Project cost estimates include local&#13;
taxes and duties derived from the following tax rates: (i) 18 percent for civil&#13;
works, furniture, architectural and engineering fees, services of consulting firms,&#13;
and operating/maintenance costs; and (ii) 22 percent for the services of individual&#13;
specialists. Total taxes on the project are estimated at 18 percent of total project&#13;
cost including contingencies.&#13;
(e)    Recurrent Costs. The annual preventive maintenance of the rehabilitated schools,&#13;
will impose significant recurrent costs as a result of the project. However, once&#13;
the buildings are rehabilitated, these costs (about 1.5 percent of building&#13;
rehabilitation cost) are expected to be substantially lower than the current annual&#13;
budgetary allocations for school maintenance (reportedly five percent of the&#13;
investment cost).&#13;

            Romania - School Rehabilitation Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This project supports Romania's
            efforts to rehabilitate schools up to the safety standards
            and pedagogic norms established by the Ministry of Education
            in accordance with the Education Reform Project. The
            objectives of the project are to: 1) restore school
            buildings in imminent danger of collapse, and mitigate the
            educational disadvantages to students occupying such
            schools; and 2) improve the Ministry of Education's
            institutional capacity at the national and district levels
            to plan, develop, and maintain the public educational
            physical plant. The project's two main components are:
            1) rehabilitating, upgrading, and furnishing kindergarten,
            primary, and secondary schools in 41 districts; and 2)
            strengthening the sectoral capacity of the education
            ministry, at both the national and Judet levels, to plan,
            implement, and manage the government's school
            investment and rehabilitation program; and to manage and
            maintain the public educational physical plant.
