&#13;
                                  Tranche Release Document&#13;
&#13;
 I.Recommendation&#13;
&#13;
 1.      Ukraine (the Borrower) has met all but two conditions for release o f the second&#13;
 tranche o f the Second Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL-2). A waiver i s sought on the&#13;
 condition contained in paragraph 2 o f Schedule 3 o f the Loan Agreement: "The Borrower&#13;
 has continued to improve the payment discipline in the electricity and gas sector through the&#13;
 satisfactory implementation o f debt resolution, as evinced by: (i)the adoption by the&#13;
 Parliament (Verkhovna Rada) o f a comprehensive law on debt resolutioninthe energy sector;&#13;
 and (ii)the obligatory participation o f enterprises, inwhich the state has a controlling share,&#13;
 inthe debt resolution mechanism established by the said law." A partialwaiver is sought on&#13;
 the condition o f paragraph 6 (i) f Schedule 3 o f the Loan Agreement with regard to the&#13;
                                    o&#13;
 engaging o f the financial advisor for the privatization o f a group o f remaining state-owned&#13;
 Oblenergos (power-distribution companies) and the launching o f the corresponding&#13;
 privatization tender . These waivers are recommended on the grounds set forth inparagraphs&#13;
 20-21 o f this tranche release document. In view o f the performance in implementing the&#13;
 Program supported by the Loan, it is recommended to release its second tranche in the&#13;
 amount o f USD 172.5 million.&#13;
&#13;
 11.Background&#13;
&#13;
 2.     The Programmatic Adjustment Loan Program (PAL) was developed with the&#13;
 Government o f Ukraine in2001. PAL was envisaged as a series o f three loans totaling US$&#13;
 750 million in support o f the government's program o f institutional and structural reform. It&#13;
i s designed across five thematic areas: (a) financial discipline, (b) regulatory reform, (c)&#13;
protection o f property rights, (d) public sector accountability, and (e) management o f social&#13;
and environmental risks. The first PAL o f US$250 millionwas approved by the World Bank&#13;
Board o f Executive Directors in September 2001. It was disbursed in two tranches, o f&#13;
US$lSO just after Board approval, and a second tranche o f US$lOO on December 7, 2001&#13;
upon completion o f 2"d tranche benchmarks. PAL-1 included indicative benchmarks for the&#13;
proposed PAL-2 and PAL-3 operations.&#13;
&#13;
3.      The PAL program was designedto disbursein sequence with completion o f concrete&#13;
achievements on the institutional and structural reform program o f the government.&#13;
Preparations for PAL-2 began in January 2002, and it was approved by the Board in&#13;
December 2003. A first tranche o f US$ 75 million was disbursed on December 19, 2003&#13;
basedupon completion o fthe pre-Board benchmarks.&#13;
&#13;
4.      The Government and the Bank have completed negotiations on a proposed First&#13;
Development Policy Loan (DPL-1) program, which would carry forward the PAL agenda in&#13;
the context o fthe new government program.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 111.Recent Developments&#13;
&#13;
 5.     Political Developments: The 2004 Presidential Elections represent significant&#13;
 political change. Mr. Viktor Yushchenko was elected President with a clear mandate to&#13;
 integrate Ukraine with Europe and fight corruption. H e has committed to undertake the&#13;
 necessary legal and political changes to improve the welfare o f Ukraine's citizens by&#13;
 establishing broad-based social and economic development.                    President Yushchenko's&#13;
 nominee to the post o f Prime Minister,&#13;
 Ms. Yulia Timoshenko, was confirmed                            Ukraine PovertyIncidence&#13;
 by the Verkhovna Rada on February 1,                  (percent of populationunderthe poverty line)&#13;
 2005. Her Government's program is&#13;
 designed to uphold this mandate by&#13;
 implementing the policy, institutional&#13;
 and structural reforms necessary to          30%&#13;
 bringit to fruition.&#13;
                                              25%&#13;
&#13;
 6.     Economic          Developments:       20%&#13;
 During the PAL period, Ukraine&#13;
 improved its      macroeconomic      and     IS %&#13;
&#13;
 fiscal framework      and experienced        10%&#13;
 strong economic growth and poverty                  1999        2000        2001      2002        2003&#13;
 reduction. In the years since the 1998          +                                       -+-&#13;
regional financial crisis, improvements                 Largecities          Smalltowns            Ruralarea&#13;
&#13;
 in financial discipline,     fiscal and     ource' WB estimates,UkraineHBS&#13;
&#13;
monetary policies, current account adjustment (supported by a weak real exchange rate),&#13;
regional growth trends, and improvements in the business climate have resulted in strong&#13;
GDP growth totaling 50% for the period 1999 through 2004. The highest growth measured&#13;
over this period occurred in 2004 when GDP growth o f 12.1 percent was spurred by further&#13;
improvements in the terms o f trade and pre-election fiscal expansion. High growth over the&#13;
post 1998 period led to significantly lower poverty incidence, which declined from over 30&#13;
percent in 1999-2001 to 19 percent in 2003, and i s expected to have fallen further in 2004.&#13;
However, a rural-urban divide remains, and some groups o f the population are especially&#13;
vulnerable, especially children inlarge families, the elderly and the disabled.&#13;
&#13;
7.      The public debt to GDP ratio has declined. Primary fiscal surpluses o f 0-2 percent&#13;
GDP during 1999-2003 have helped to reduce the public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt&#13;
(incl. IMFcredit) ratio from 61 percent GDP in 1999 to 25 percent GDP in2004.&#13;
&#13;
8.      During the last 5 years, Ukraine's current account has been in surplus, and the&#13;
National Bank o f Ukraine (NBU) has accumulated substantial foreign exchange reserves&#13;
which now exceed the value o f 4 months o f merchandise imports. Continuing recent trends,&#13;
strong external demand and improvements in the terms o f trade, in particular high world&#13;
prices for steel, resulted in a record current account surplus o f 10.4 percent o f GDP in 2004.&#13;
Untilrecently, the NBUmaintained a policy of defacto fixing o f the hrynia against the US&#13;
dollar at around 5.3 UAWUSD. In 2003-2004, the hryvnia depreciated inreal terms due to&#13;
higher inflation inRussia, and the Euro appreciation against the U S dollar.&#13;
&#13;
9.      The resilience o f the macroeconomic fiamework was tested by the political crisis&#13;
during the presidential election. Households' loss o f confidence during the election process&#13;
resulted in exit from hryvnia holdings, resulting in pressure on the international reserves o f&#13;
the NBU, which declined by almost USD 3 billion. However, sound monetary policy and&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 banking sector management during the political crisis, and the strong fundamentals outlined&#13;
  above, were sufficient to avoid a financial crisis.      The situation in the banking sector&#13;
  stabilized as soon as the political crisis was resolved, evinced by a recovery in reserves, the&#13;
  exchange rate, interest rates, and inter-bank liquidity.&#13;
&#13;
  10.     The new authorities inherited unbalanced public finances. The 2005 State Budget&#13;
 Law, adopted inDecember 2004, envisioned a general government deficit o f 2.1% GDP. But&#13;
 this deficit figure did not account for all expenditures, including the legislated increase in&#13;
 minimum pensions to the level of the subsistence minimum which was enacted by the&#13;
 Cabinet of Ministers in September of 2004, and enacted through legislation in December&#13;
 2004. Simulations suggested that without adjustments, the deficit of the general government&#13;
 would infact have increased closer to 7 percent o f GDP.&#13;
&#13;
  11.     A s a priority measure, the new Administration has revised the 2005 Budget through&#13;
 parliamentary approval on March 25, 2005, and reduced the targeted consolidated deficit to&#13;
 2.2 percent of GDP.         While President Yushchenko has made it clear that the new&#13;
 administration would keep the social promises legislated late last year, the Government has&#13;
 responded to the fiscal gap by enhancing revenue measures and containing expenditure&#13;
 growth. Revenue measures include: (a) eliminating most tax exemptions, (b) increasing&#13;
 excise taxes for fuel and alcohol, (c) charging higher rents for extractive industries, (d)&#13;
 significantly lowering import some tariffs, and (f) seeking to improve SOE management&#13;
 throughprofit incentives and associated higher profit transfers to the budget. There is also a&#13;
 broad effort to transfer shadow economic activity to the formal economy through better&#13;
 leadership and reduced corruption, especially within revenue authorities. On expenditures,&#13;
 the Government has taken early steps toward addressing the pension problem, including&#13;
 rebasing privileged pensions o n their real levels at the time of the 2003 pension reform, and&#13;
 indexing pensions only to CPI (not to CPI plus 20 percent of the nominal average wage&#13;
 increase inthe economy).&#13;
&#13;
 12.     Early indications are positive in terms of tax revenue collections. Inthe first quarter&#13;
of 2005, the revenues o f consolidated (state and all local) budget grew, inreal terms, by 28&#13;
percent year-on-year, especially from increased VAT (up by 51percent year-on-year) and the&#13;
corporate profit tax (up by 34 percent year-on-year). However, the highnet VAT collections&#13;
data overstates progress; gross VAT collections were up by 28 percent only in real terms,&#13;
while VAT refunds declined by 14 percent. The State Tax Administration (STA) insists that&#13;
reductions in VAT refunds are due to technical and legal reasons, and the problem will be&#13;
addressed. The still substantial revenue increases may reflect a permanent reduction of the&#13;
shadow economy, particularly through changes in the management of Customs and the State&#13;
Tax Administration, or it may reflect a more temporary, risk averse behavior of tax&#13;
inspectors, customs officials and entrepreneurs, which will not be preserved without&#13;
improved technical administration to permanently stop corruption.&#13;
&#13;
13.      In response to inflationary pressures, the Authorities have started to re-align the&#13;
exchange rate. On April 20, the NBU slowed its purchases of the net inflow of dollars,&#13;
allowing a one-off shift of the de facto peg to 5.05 hryvnia per U S dollar. This moderate&#13;
exchange rate realignment has helped establish the basis to move toward a floating rate inthe&#13;
context of the plan to move to inflation targeting. The exchange rate realignment will help to&#13;
reduce inflationary pressures through a number of channels: lowering prices o f imported&#13;
goods, reducing the current account surplus, and lowering the relative value inhryvnia of net&#13;
inflows o f foreign exchange. These factors will help reduce money supply growth while&#13;
reducing opportunities for currency speculation.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  14.     Policy coordination is improving. The Prime Minister has explained benefits o f the&#13;
 NBU's stance on revaluating the exchange rate, while noting the independence of the NBU.&#13;
 At parliamentary hearings after the exchange rate realignment, the Minister of Finance&#13;
  supported the move by the NBU. In April, the Minister of Finance managed to reduce the&#13;
 costs of debt service and helped the NBUto sterilize the money supply throughbuy-back of&#13;
 the government debt held by the NBU. The Letter o f Development Policy (LDP) dated&#13;
 November 12, 2003 recognizes the importance of macroeconomic stability (see Annex 1). It&#13;
 expresses the aim to strengthen the macroeconomic policy framework through adjustment o f&#13;
 monetary and exchange rate policies, impose more stringent budget restraints on consumption&#13;
 expenditures - especially unsustainable recurrent transfers,       eliminate uncertainty and&#13;
 excessive complexity in the tax system, and adopt clearer principles of government&#13;
 borrowing. The Government has indicated that it will take necessary corrective actions if&#13;
 macroeconomic stability is threatened.&#13;
&#13;
  15.     The strengthened macroeconomic management is reflected in market optimism. The&#13;
 Ukrainian government has recently issued hryvnia-denominated Treasury bills with a&#13;
 maturity of one-year, yielding 4.5 percent. This represents a dramatic decline from T-bill&#13;
 rates one year ago, which exceeded 10 percent. The improved climate for government paper&#13;
 can be attributed to optimism for current and future economic prospects as well as&#13;
 perceptions of a substantial undervaluation of the currency. In May, Standard and Poor also&#13;
 upgraded Ukraine's sovereign credit rating from BB- to B+ reflecting, in good part, the&#13;
 improvements ineconomic management.&#13;
&#13;
 16.     While the medium-term macro-policy agenda still needs to be more fully articulated,&#13;
 the new Government's active recognition of, and response to, the economic risks it inherited,&#13;
 and the well-established track record o f strong economic growth, and stable macroeconomic&#13;
 indicators over the recent past, indicate that the macro policy framework is adequate for the&#13;
 second tranche o f PAL-2 to proceed. To date, growth continues to be strong, debt i s low and&#13;
 falling, and foreign reserves are at record levels. The Government has targeted a halving of&#13;
 the inherited budget deficit as a proportion o f GDP. Fiscal performance throughthe first four&#13;
months of 2005 is already ahead of ambitious targets.         The authorities have introduced&#13;
measures to combat inflation,        liberalize the exchange rate, and strengthen overall&#13;
macroeconomic management.&#13;
&#13;
 17.     The authorities have indicated a willingness to engage with the IMF. The 12-month&#13;
precautionary stand-by arrangement between the IMFand Ukraine expired inMarch 2005. A&#13;
review of precautionary stand-by was not completed.         In particular, the IMF noted pro-&#13;
cyclical amendments to the 2004 budget and weak legislation on connected lending in the&#13;
banking sector. The Authorities have signaled general interest in a successor precautionary&#13;
arrangement, but have not yet indicated a timefiame for discussion.&#13;
&#13;
V. Progress under PAL-2&#13;
&#13;
18.      A s was mentioned above, the PAL Program supports the Government's program of&#13;
structural and institutional reforms articulated around five thematic cross-cutting areas,&#13;
covering the following activities: (a) financial discipline; (b) regulatory framework; (c)&#13;
property rights; (d) public sector accountability, and (e) management of social and&#13;
environmental risks.&#13;
&#13;
19.      Overall, progress in program implementation has been significant with many&#13;
important accomplishments, including improved financial discipline as evidenced by reduced&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 budget, tax and inter-enterprise arrears, an improved regulatory framework in the financial&#13;
 sector, further advance towards creation o f conditions for Ukraine's accession to the WTO,&#13;
 particularly in areas o f technical regulation and intellectual property rights, a strengthened&#13;
 system o f budget execution and intergovernmental finance, establishment o f a legislative and&#13;
 institutional framework for pension reform, better targeted social assistance and improved&#13;
 quality o f social care. The Table below summarizes progress made under specific Board and&#13;
 second tranche release benchmarks, and thus represents a core sub-set o f overall progress&#13;
 achieved under the Letter o f Development Policy.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
20.     In addition to significant overall progress, the Borrower has surpassed the original&#13;
benchmarks of the PAL-2 in a number o f cases. These include, among the many areas of&#13;
continued progress, on cash collections ingas and electricity, progress on development o f EU&#13;
technical procedures and adoption o f voluntary product standards, enactment o f the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 legislative basis for a modern three pillar pension system, enactment o f good laws on&#13;
 mortgage and secured interest, establishment o f the institutional and enforcement basis to&#13;
 combat money laundering and financing of terrorists, measures to improve customs&#13;
 procedures, establishment o f a communications regulator, and dramatic reduction o f tax&#13;
 exemptions, from an already low base. Specific to the second tranche benchmarks, all legal&#13;
 conditions have been completed with the exception o f condition set forth in paragraph 2,&#13;
 Schedule 3 of the Loan Agreement regarding enactment by the Verkhovna Rada o f a&#13;
 comprehensive law on debt restructuring in the energy sector, and partially on para 6 (i),&#13;
 Schedule 3 o f the Loan Agreement with regard to engaging o f the financial advisor for the&#13;
 privatization o f a group o f remaining state-owned Oblenergos (power-distribution&#13;
 companies) and the launching o f the corresponding privatization tender . The waivers are&#13;
 recommended on the basis o fthe following reasoning.&#13;
&#13;
 21.     The Government has confirmed that it is committed to continuing energy sector&#13;
 reforms, and supported by PAL-2, has developed anAction Planfor Financial Recovery of&#13;
 the Fuel and Energy Sector. This plan was approved by the Cabinet o f Ministers on May&#13;
 28, 2005 and published inthe national standard. The plan calls for continued improvements&#13;
 in cash collections of energy services, reduction of cross-subsidization of tariffs, bringing&#13;
 tariffs to full cost recovery levels (including investment needs), better management o f&#13;
remaining state-owned companies in the sector, strategic industrial re-organization, and&#13;
various options for additional private participation inthe sector. The plan forms a basis for a&#13;
 strategic program to be developed for the overall energy sector. At the same time, the&#13;
Borrower has requested a waiver on two related steps agreed underthe PAL-2: (a) passage of&#13;
a comprehensive debt restructuring law inthe energy sector, and (b) launching o f a tender for&#13;
privatization o f a group o f power companies. A concept and draft law for debt restructuring&#13;
has been prepared under the PAL-2 program, and i s under consideration o f the Fuel and&#13;
Energy Committee in the Verkhovna Rada, where it has been approved for the second&#13;
reading.     While the new Government supports the goals and principles o f the debt&#13;
restructuring concept, it i s reviewing the structure o f the workout and write-off mechanisms&#13;
as envisaged inthe draft law. The Government has expressedits concerns about passageo f a&#13;
law, which will include debt write-offs for non-technical losses o fthe past, while allowing for&#13;
partial payment o f those losses with a tariff increase to consumers, inthe run-upto the March&#13;
2006 parliamentary election. Debt restructuring i s crucial prior to privatization, since the&#13;
power companies in question have large debt overhang. Inthe context o f the Government's&#13;
concerns about the non-transparency o f past privatizations in Ukraine, it plans to move&#13;
forward on power privatization not earlier than the latter half o f 2006, after the debt&#13;
restructuring law i s passed and under implementation, and in light o f a new privatization&#13;
program with a clearer focus on the transparency and quality o f privatization o f large state&#13;
owned companies.&#13;
&#13;
22.     It is proposed to proceed with the PAL-2 second tranche of US$172.5 million inthe&#13;
context o f a new agreement on the proposed Development Policy Loan for Ukraine inwhich&#13;
the energy sector objectives o fthe PAL program would be subsumed and achieved.&#13;

     are prohibited with the exception o f the tariff level for the communal service companies.&#13;
&#13;
a) This sub-condition has been met. The law introducing the provision on charges for&#13;
     untimely payment for consumed electricity, gas and communal services has been&#13;
     submitted to the Verkhovna Rada and adopted on June 24,2004.&#13;
&#13;
b) This sub-condition has beenmet. Article 191ofthe Economic Code that came into force&#13;

     Services", No. 1875-IV, that came into effect in January 2005, require local executive&#13;
     authorities and local self-governments to compensate communal enterprises for the&#13;
     difference between established (fixed) tariffs and actual, economically justified costs, for&#13;
     services. Additionally, as a legislative harmonization step, the CoM submitted to the&#13;

as of January 1, 2003. The difference o f UAH 141 million is marginal, relative to the margin o f error of the&#13;
official and best available data source, as a percentage o f GDP (0.04 percent GDP), and relative to monthly&#13;
energy sector tax payments (10% o f average monthly payments so far in2005). The level innominal UAH&#13;

     creation o f an emergency reserve list o fpotentially environmentally hazardous enterprises&#13;
     was adopted on December 26, 2003. This resolution creates a system by which harder&#13;
     budget constraints can be imposed on enterprises, which if shut down because o f energy&#13;
     nonpayment, would create environmental hazard.             The emergency reserve allows&#13;
     corrective action to be taken during a period covered by the reserve fund. In addition,&#13;
     Budget Law 2004 allocated UAH 37.0 million from the special fund o f the State Budget&#13;
     to the Ministry for Emergency Situations to finance electricity reserve for enterprises in&#13;

     developed a new version o f the Procedures in compliance with the Law on Housing and&#13;
     Communal Services. These draft Procedures were agreed with the Bank, considered at&#13;

&#13;
 (iii)This condition has been met. Since July 2003, the Savings Bank has been operating under&#13;
      requirements established through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) co-signed by&#13;
      the National Bank of Ukraine, the Ministry of Finance o f Ukraine and the Head of the&#13;
      Supervisory Board o f State Saving Bank. While operating under restrictions of the MoU,&#13;
      Savings Bank was obliged to undergo diagnostics of its IT systems, its lending portfolio&#13;
      and its internal risk controls.     In addition, it was required to develop a business plan&#13;
      acceptable to the signatories of the memorandum and develop a strategic plan for its&#13;
      restructuring.  Savings     Bank has successfully            carried out its obligations            and&#13;
      responsibilities under the MOU, although the signatories have not officially approved the&#13;
      Savings Bank's response to the MOU. The Savings Bank has adhered to the restrictions:&#13;
      inJuly 2004 it presented a three-year business plan satisfactory to the World Bank, and&#13;
      the diagnostics have been completed,           Under the restrictions the Savings Bank had a&#13;
      financially successful year in 2004, reaching 98 percent of its required NBU provisions&#13;
      for non-performing assets. It has also achieved its required level of regulatory capital&#13;
      with the exception of NBU single borrower and insider exposure. Under the proposed&#13;
      Development Policy Loan for Ukraine, a Memorandum of Development will be put in&#13;
      place which outlines an operational and strategic solution for Saving Bank.&#13;

      for Regulation o f Financial Services Markets. This fundingexceeds the amount provided&#13;
     to the Commission during its first year of operations, i.e. 2003. Although this level of&#13;
     funding is believed to be insufficient to cover the institutional development costs of the&#13;
     regulator (first of all in such areas as I T i M I S investment, training and adequate&#13;
     remuneration of staff), it is expected that the Government will undertake necessary steps&#13;
     to establish more conducive environment for enhancing the performance o f the regulatory&#13;
     agencies, including increased institutional independence, strengthened enforcement&#13;
     powers, larger funding and more adequate remuneration and personnel development&#13;

            Ukraine has met all but two conditions
            for release of the second tranche of the Second Programmatic

            through the satisfactory implementation of debt resolution,
            as evinced by: (i) the adoption by the Parliament (Verkhovna
            Rada) of a comprehensive law on debt resolution in the
            energy sector; and (ii) the obligatory participation of
            enterprises, in which the state has a controlling share, in
            the debt resolution mechanism established by the said law.
