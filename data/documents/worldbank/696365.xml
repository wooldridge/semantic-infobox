This document is based on the findings of an appraisal mission to Romania from December 4 to 15, 1995. Members of the&#13;
mission included Felix A. Jakob (Task Manager); Augusta Dianderas (Water Sector Specialist); Pascal Douard (Municipal&#13;
Engineer); Bernardo Gomez (Financial Analyst); Anca Dumitrescu (Project Officer, Romania Resident Mission); and Kristalina&#13;
Georgieva (Environmental Specialist). Mirtha Pokorny (ECIIN) helped in the preparation of the economic evaluation and Anita&#13;
George (EClIN) in that of the final results of the financial analysis. Peer reviewers were Vincent Gouarne (EMTIE), Peter&#13;
Koenig (EMTAW), and Guillermo Yepes (TWUWS). The Division Chief is Ricardo A. Halperin and the Department Director&#13;
is Kenneth Lay. The project was prepared with the support of a Japanese Government PHRD Grant to Romania.&#13;

BUCHAREST WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Executive Loan and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:             Romania&#13;
Beneficiary and       Regia Generall de Apa Bucuresti - RGAB (Bucharest Water and&#13;
Implementing Agency:  Sewerage Company)&#13;
IBRD Loan Amount:   US$ 25 million&#13;
Lending Terms:        Twenty years, including five years of grace, at the standard variable interest&#13;
rate for LIBOR-based US Dollar single currency loans.&#13;
On-Lending Terms:    To RGAB, for twenty years, including five years of grace, at the standard&#13;
variable interest rate for LIBOR-based US Dollar single currency loans.&#13;
Project Objectives:   The primary objectives of the project are to: (a) improve the reliability and&#13;
quality of water supply in Bucharest; (b) progressively reduce water losses&#13;
(both physical and commercial); and (c) strengthen RGAB's operational,&#13;
commercial and financial management.&#13;
Project Description:    To achieve these objectives, the project would comprise the following&#13;
components:&#13;
(a)  Improvement of water supply reliability and quality - through the&#13;
rehabilitation of water treatment plants and water pumping stations (US$&#13;
14.5 million; 33% of base cost);&#13;
(b)  Reduction of water losses - through (i) the repair and replacement of&#13;
deteriorated sections of the primary and secondary distribution network&#13;
in several neighborhoods of Bucharest; and (ii) the replacement of meters&#13;
foi residential and commercial consumers; (US$ 24.9 million; 57% of&#13;
base cost); and&#13;
(c)  Institutional Strengthening of RGAB - through technical assistance to&#13;
improve the company's customer account management for the&#13;
reorganization of billing and collection operations, develop the&#13;
effectiveness of its operational management, and prepare and implement&#13;
public awareness and water conservation programs, (US$ 4.1 million;&#13;
9% of base cost).&#13;
Project Benefits:     The project supports the rehabilitation of infrastructure which has been&#13;
identified as a priority in the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The&#13;
project benefits for RGAB would consist in (a) decreases in operating costs as&#13;
a result of the progressive reduction of physical and commercial water losses;&#13;
and (b) increases in RGAB revenues from the improvement in the company's&#13;
commercial and financial management. The IRR, that has been calculated&#13;
with very conservative assumptions for the project components with&#13;
quantifiable benefits (76% of total base cost), is about 12%. The benefits for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
the consumer, though not quantifiable, are significant and include improved&#13;
reliability of water supply in terms of daily hours of adequate supply and&#13;
pressure, as well as an improvement in water quality and concurrent reduction&#13;
of public health risks arising from water-borne diseases.&#13;
Environmental Impact: The project has been classified as a category "B" project. An environmental&#13;
review has been carried out consistent with the provisions of the World Bank's&#13;
O.D. 4.01 "Environmental Assessment" and the applicable environmental&#13;
procedures of the Government of Romania.&#13;
Project Risks:         The principal risks faced by the proposed project are of two kinds: financial&#13;
risks: although assurances have been given, and official commitments made,&#13;
by both the Romania Government and the Bucharest municipality as to the&#13;
availability of counterpart funding, Bank-experience shows that the possibility&#13;
of a future shortfall of such resources either at the central government level&#13;
(owing to a deterioration of the country's macro-economic conditions) or at&#13;
the Bucharest municipality level (owing to local fiscal difficulties) can never&#13;
be ruled out entirely; and technical risks: even if carefully planned and&#13;
prepared, the implementation of a first-time investment operation by a new&#13;
beneficiary carries inherent risks, including possible delays in implementation&#13;
start-up due to (i) the beneficiary's general inexperience in this type of&#13;
activity; and (ii) his lack of practice in dealing with the complexity of the&#13;
procurement review and approval process by the Government.&#13;
While the technical risks can be mitigated by the build-up of RGAB's&#13;
implementation capacity through provision of technical assistance and an early&#13;
completion of procurement documents, the project's financial risks are, to a&#13;
large extent, not project-, but country-specific. They can only be addressed&#13;
through the continuation and intensification of the ongoing dialogue with the&#13;
Government and the Bucharest municipality on institutional and financial&#13;
management issues for local governments. The risk of a deterioration of&#13;
RGAB's financial performance and its ensuing inability to make its financial&#13;
contribution to the project is mitigated by (a) the Government, the Bucharest&#13;
municipality, and RGAB's to implement the three-year Short-Term Action&#13;
Plan (STAP) included in the project; and the implementation of a technical&#13;
assistance program for the strengthening of RGAB's customer account&#13;
management department that was initiated in January 1996 under funding from&#13;
the French Government. Rigorous planning of work execution and continuous&#13;
monitoring of project implementation by staff from Bank headquarters and the&#13;
Bank Resident Mission in Romania is planned.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. COUNTRY AND SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Country and Sectoral Context&#13;
1.1           Country Profile. With a land area of 283,000 km2 and a population of about 23 million,&#13;
Romania is the second largest country in Eastern Europe, after Poland. Until World War 11 a country&#13;
with an agriculture-dominated economy, Romania underwent, under the communist rule, a process of&#13;
forced industrialization that inter alia resulted in an increase of the urbanization rate from 23 % in 1948&#13;
to 54% in 1990. Following the overturn of the Ceaucescu regime in 1989 the economy suffered a decline&#13;
of about 40% over the first three years of transition. Since then it has resumed growing reaching in 1994&#13;
a growth rate of 4% and a GDP per capita of about US$ 1,450. The growth rate is estimated to have&#13;
reached 5% in 1995 and could stay at that level for the rest of the decade if sound economic policies&#13;
continue to be followed. Inflation that was at 260% in 1993, decreased to 137% in 1994, and to 31%&#13;
in 1995. The economic transition has not gone without deeply affecting the population's living standards.&#13;
According to the Bank's 1995 Poverty Assessment, average household income in 1993 stood, in real&#13;
terms, at about 80% of that of 1989, while over the same interval the level of poverty had countrywide&#13;
increased from about 4% to about 22%. In 1995 Romania became an associate member of the European&#13;
Union and it is expected that this will contribute to accelerate the transition to a market economy.&#13;
1.2           In parallel to taking the necessary measures to stabilize the economy, the Government has&#13;
moved on a number of structural reforms. Significant progress has been made in price reform (including&#13;
the reduction of controls on industrial and agricultural products, energy price increases to acceptable&#13;
levels and virtual elimination of consumer subsidies) and tax reform. The most difficult challenges have&#13;
been the enforcement of enterprise financial discipline and the acceleration of privatization, two issues&#13;
that are now addressed, in coordination with the IMF, under the Financial and Enterprise Sector&#13;
Adjustment Loan (FESAL) which was approved by the Board on January 18, 1996.&#13;
1.3           Local Government. In 1991 Romania reverted to local autonomy as a basic principle&#13;
of governance and established a two-tiered system of public administration, within which the central&#13;
governmert and State administration is paralleled by a system of local government. The local government&#13;
system is comprised of two distinct, non-hierarchically organized segments: district governments (judefe)&#13;
and municipalities (municipii, orare, and comune).' Districts, of which there are forty-one (including&#13;
Bucharest), are responsible for matters of regional/sub-regional interest, whereas municipalities, totalling&#13;
close to 3,000, are in charge of matters of local interest. Because of its role as the country's capital and&#13;
the size of its population, Bucharest has a special status as it combines features of both a district and a&#13;
municipality.&#13;
1.4           Although endowed, in principle, with autonomy in financial management, local&#13;
governments (both districts and municipalities) have little own revenue and therefore rely extensively on&#13;
inter-governmental fiscal transfers for both the funding of current and capital expenditures. Financing&#13;
The classification reflects population size and geographical importance of the locality, but does not involve any difference&#13;
in terms of legal obligations and/or responsibilities of the respective local governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
of major investment projects is almost exclusively secured through project-specific investment grarnts from&#13;
the State budget. Because of the decline of the overall economy and the Government's efforts to reduce&#13;
inflation, investment appropriations for local infrastructure and services which in comparison to other&#13;
countries have traditionally been low in Romania, have shrunk even further in recent years falling from&#13;
2.2% of GDP in 19l to 1.9% in 1994. As a result, there is an enormous backlog of investment needs&#13;
which, if not addressed, may pose constraints to the resumption of economic growth.&#13;
1.5           Provision of Local Public Services. Provision of local public services is a responsibility&#13;
of municipalities. Most services are delivered by local utilities, so-called local regie autonome (Ras).&#13;
Local RAs were created in 1990 as a result of the break-up of the of the former State enterprise complex.&#13;
Local RAs are legally independent entities endowed with a distinct administrative board, but operate&#13;
under the overall supervision and regulatory oversight of the municipal governments. They are run, in&#13;
principle, on a self-financ..Ag basis and have the legal capacity to raise loans for the financing of their&#13;
capital expenditure needs. Tariffs for services are regulated by the-municipal authorities in consultation&#13;
with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and, specifically, its Department for Prices and Protection of&#13;
Competitiori. Typically, tariffs cover only the operating costs of the utilities, whereas investments for&#13;
infrastructure ani equipment, like other municipal investments, are financed, on a grant basis, from the&#13;
central government budget and, occasionally, from small contributions by the municipalities themselves.&#13;
1.6           The currently existing local RAs result from the dismantling in 1990 of previously State-&#13;
owned public service enterprises that until then operated at district level. Because their creation predates&#13;
the establishment of the new local government system in 1991, the legal regime under which these local&#13;
RAs operate has remained imprecisely defined in certain areas. A definitive ruling on the property&#13;
regime of RA assets that were formerly owned by the State is still outstanding and some aspects of the&#13;
legal relationship between the local RAs, the overseeing municipal authorities, and the central government&#13;
administration still require further clarification, in particular as far as the precise delimitation of the&#13;
respective competencies in matters of setting of technical and financial objectives, and monitoring of&#13;
management performance is concerned. However, the existence of these deficiencies does not pose any&#13;
problem  for the proposed operation.  Moreover, amendments to the existing legislation on local&#13;
governments are currently under discussion at the Parliament.&#13;
1.7           Like their equivalent operating at national level, most local RAs face severe financial&#13;
problems. Their ability to offset cost increases is constrained by a complex approval process that is often&#13;
influenced by political concerns about the possible impact of tariff increases. Moreover, they are&#13;
confronted with a widespread lack of payment discipline among their customers. As a result, local RAs&#13;
face difficulty to meet their financial obligations. Financial shortfalls have been customarily minimized&#13;
by cutting maintenance expenditures below acceptable levels and delaying payments to suppliers. Because&#13;
of the potentially severe macroeconomic consequences of a continuing build-up of public sector enterprise&#13;
arrears, restoring stricter discipline in the financial management of public enterprises is one of the&#13;
objectives of the FESAL which includes Financial Recovery Plans (FRP) for a series of RAs.&#13;
1.8           Water Sector.  Romania is comparatively well endowed with both surface and&#13;
underground water resources, although their distribution across the territory is uneven. Like other natural&#13;
resources, water is declared by the Romanian Constitution to be an exclusive and inalienable public&#13;
property. There is no single institution specifically responsible for sector policies as a whole. Use of&#13;
water resources at the national level is administered and regulated by the Ministry of Water, Forestry and&#13;
Environment (MOWFEN) within which a specific body - APELE ROMANE - is in charge of water&#13;
management questions. MOWFEN is also responsible for monitoring and enforcing water pollution and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
quality standards, while specific drinking water standards are monitored by the Ministry of Health&#13;
(MOH). Provision of water supply, sewerage and waste water treatment services is a responsibility of&#13;
municipal governments. Operational quality standards and norms for water and sewerage utilities are set&#13;
by the Ministry of Public Works and Regional Development (MOPWRD), while the financial aspects of&#13;
local utility management are monitored by MOF.&#13;
1.9          Water resource management by APELE ROMANE is organized on a watershed basis with&#13;
specific bodies set up for each of the country's eleven major river basins. These bodies are in charge&#13;
of regulating water allocation to different users as well as acting as executing agencies for all investment&#13;
programs related to water resource management. Water is provided by APELE ROMANE to municipal&#13;
water companies for an abstraction fee. Charges for water abstraction are set by the Government on a&#13;
countrywide unitary basis (currently ROL 5,967 per 1,000 m3 for domestic consumption and ROL 16,271&#13;
per 1,000 m3 for industrial use). Fees for waste water discharges and pollution are regulated similarly.&#13;
Though most legislation regarding water resource management still dates back to the previous regime,&#13;
a new law on water resources is presently under preparation. A new law on the protection of the&#13;
environment was approved in December 1995. Romania has ratified the 1992 Convention on the use and&#13;
protection of international rivers and lakes. It is member of the Black Sea Convention and has ratified&#13;
the 1994 Danube River Protection Convention.&#13;
1.10         Water supply conditions in Romania are poor by international standards. Only about 50%&#13;
of the total population has access to piped drinking water supply with the proportion going from about&#13;
80% for urban areas, to only about 20% in rural areas. However, such statistics must be interpreted with&#13;
caution. Indeed, because of the general dilapidation of water supply systems, the quality of water&#13;
available in urban areas is considered, in many cases, to be inferior to that of the water obtained from&#13;
sources or wells in rural areas. The service level for sewerage is significantly lower with only about 40%&#13;
of households connected and most of them located in urban areas. Wastewater treatment is similarly&#13;
insufficient as highlighted by the studies carried out under the Environmental Program for the Danube&#13;
River Basin. According to available statistics, about two hundred municipal waste water treatment plants&#13;
are currently operating. However, they are, in a large proportion, equipped for primary treatment only&#13;
and, therefore, have a relatively reduced effect on pollution abatement.&#13;
B. Water Supply in Bucharest&#13;
1.11         The City. Bucharest, as the capital of Romania and the country's largest urban center,&#13;
has a population of about 2.1 million which represents about 10% of the total population. At present,&#13;
Bucharest counts some 750,000 households of which over 80% live in multi-level apartment buildings&#13;
(blocs) built during the last forty years predominantly with industrial pre-fabrication techniques.&#13;
Population growth since 1989 has stagnated in reaction to the decline of the economy and the shrinking&#13;
of the labor market in the industrial sector. Given the prevailing demographic dynamics (with a natural&#13;
growth rate of close to zero) and the weak prospects in Bucharest for a rapid resumption of labor-&#13;
intensive activities, no significant urban growth is expected. Despite the extensive loss of employment,&#13;
Bucharest has suffered comparatively less from the economic transition than other parts of the country&#13;
and, in 1994, less than 10% of its population was estimated to live below the poverty level.&#13;
1.12         Bucharest Water and Sewerage Company (Regia GeneralA de ApE-Bucurelti/RGAB).&#13;
The construction of a modem city wide water supply system including a first water treatment plant began&#13;
towards the end of the 19th century. The system has been successively expanded and, operated at present&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
by the Bucharest Water and Sewerage Company (Regia Generall de Apa Bucure$ti - RGAB), supplies&#13;
drinking water to about 93 % of all households as well as to a large number of industrial, commnercial and&#13;
institutional customers. The distribution network has a total length of about 2,700 km. The daily&#13;
production of drinking water reaches currently about 1.7 million m3 and relies to about 90% on surface&#13;
sources (Arges and Dimbovila rivers) while the remainder is provided through groundwater abstraction.&#13;
Water is treated in two relatively old plants (Arcuda, Rosu) that operate between 20% and 40% beyond&#13;
their nominal capacity. A complementary third plant (Crivina-Ogrezeni) that should allow to reduce the&#13;
pressure on the existing plants, is under construction, but is not expected to become operational before&#13;
the turn of the century due to the financial constraints on the central government budget (see para. 1.18).&#13;
1.13          Water supply conditions are unsatisfactory in most parts of the city. Service interruptions&#13;
are frequent, pressure is poor and in many neighborhoods availability of reliable water supply service is&#13;
only intermittent and limited, on average, to twelve hours per day. Paradoxically, this is contrasted by&#13;
an extremely high production level which is in excess of 800 liters per capita per day. At least 60% of&#13;
.production is estimated to be lost either through leaks in the RGAB distribution network (25 %) or as a&#13;
result of building internal leaks, defective appliances and wastage by households and other RGAB&#13;
customers (35%). As a result, RGAB produces and distributes about 80% more water than it would need&#13;
to do under normal operating conditions (i.e. about 1,7 million m3 instead of about 0.9 million mi3). An&#13;
important loss contributing factor is the widely used practice of households to resort to 'coping strategies',&#13;
that is to mitigate the effects of the intermittent availability of reliable water supply by stocking reserves&#13;
in various recipients and drain most of them at the first sign of resumption of normal service conditions.&#13;
1.14          Treatment plants are operating with substandard and worn out equipment. Filtering, in&#13;
particular, is inadequate. The distribution network is in a state of advanced dilapidation, primarily owing&#13;
to the low quality of the materials used over most of the past forty years and the lack of systematic&#13;
maintenance. The quality of water delivered to the consumer is generally poor and, although no specific&#13;
data are available, risks of contamination by the intrusion of polluted groundwater in periods of service&#13;
interruption are suspected to exist in many areas. Outbreaks of viral hepatitis and acute diarrhea have&#13;
been reported, as well as, in 1995, several cases of cholera. Currently, about 85% of the city population&#13;
is served by the sewer system, the remainder relying on septic tanks. Waste water treatment, however,&#13;
is extremely unsatisfactory. A large-scale treatment plant has been under construction for over ten years&#13;
but is unlikely to be completed in the foreseeable future.&#13;
1.15           RGAB supplies cold water and provides sewerage services within the boundaries of the&#13;
Bucharest municipality. (Hot water is supplied separately by RADET, another local RA that also ensures&#13;
district heating for residential, institutional and commercial customers). RGAB was created in 1990 as&#13;
a successor to ICAB, the State-enterprise previously in charge of local services in the capital city. RGAB&#13;
purchases raw water from APELE ROMANE and treats and distributes it to residential, commercial,&#13;
industrial, and institutional customers. (Additionally, it supplies, through separate networks untreated&#13;
water to a few specific industrial customers). RGAB has a staff of about 4,800, of which about 4,000&#13;
are low-skilled workers (see Chart A). In 1995, RGAB had operating revenues of US$ 49 million&#13;
equivalent, operating costs of US$ 46 million equivalent (before depreciation), and total assets with a&#13;
book value of US$ 345 million equivalent (see Annex 2).&#13;
1.16          RGAB faces institutional and financial problems similar to those of other local Ras in&#13;
regard to its legal status, its accountabilities and the legal ownership of its assets. Like other municipal&#13;
RAs its revenues only cover its operating expenditure. However, unlike various other local RAs, RGAB&#13;
does not receive any subsidy for operational expenditures. Water sale proceeds and sewerage service&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
charges are its only source of revenue. Its financial difficulties result in a large proportion from the fact&#13;
that, for a variety of reasons, over 70% of water consumption is not metered and, as a consequence,&#13;
customers are billed on a flat-rate basis (including a sewerage surcharge) for a normative consumption&#13;
of 170 liters/day/inhabitant which is unrelated to the volume actually consumed. (Additionally, customers&#13;
are billed, under the same procedure, for a consumption of 110 liters/day/inhabitant of hot water by&#13;
RADET). Bill collection is unsatisfactory, especially from larger institutional consumers. By end of&#13;
1995, RGAB's accounts receivable stood at US$ 15 million equivalent. They equaled around 33% of&#13;
RGAB's operating revenues and about one-third of them were owed by RADET, RGAB's single largest&#13;
customer. To make ends meet, RGAB has been running up arrears with suppliers such as the National&#13;
Power Company (RENEL) and its total payables amounted to US$ 17 million equivalent by end of 1995.&#13;
1.17         RGAB's tariffs for water and sewerage are uniform and non-discriminating. They have&#13;
increased repeatedly since 1990 and, contrary to those of other public services, were allowed to keep up&#13;
with inflation, though often with substantial delay (see para. 4.6). To revert the downward trend, tariffs&#13;
were increased twice in 1995 leading to an increase of 80% in nominal terms, while total annual inflation&#13;
did not exceed 31 %. The current tariffs of US$ 0.12 2 (ROL 355) per m3 for water supply and US$&#13;
0.02 (ROL 41) for sewerage services should be sufficient to allow RGAB to cover its operating costs&#13;
(before depreciation). Further tariff increases in real terms will be unavoidable but are likely to face&#13;
significant resistance as long as income levels stay below pre-1989 levels and quality of services remains&#13;
poor. Average household expenditure for water supply and sewerage services (including hot water&#13;
purchases from RADET) at present equals about 3% of total average household expenditures, a&#13;
proportion that is substantially higher in the lower segments of the income scale. Lest increases in real&#13;
tariffs may simply help perpetuate existing inefficiencies, new real tariff adjustments should only be&#13;
contemplated after all possible cost reduction alternatives have been implemented, financial discipline&#13;
enforced and arrangements made to relate water billings to actual consumption, issues that are addressed&#13;
through the Short-Term Action Program (STAP) included in the proposed project (see para. 4.12).&#13;
1.18         To date, investments for the Bucharest water supply and sewerage system are financed,&#13;
to about 95%, by central government subsidies, the remainder being financed from the Bucharest&#13;
municipality's own resources. Over the three-year period 1992-94, the total amount of these investments&#13;
was US$ 108 million equivalent (see para. 1.21). A major part of the resources allocated went into the&#13;
continuation of works on tv/o large-scale investment projects (Glina wastewater treatment and Crivina-&#13;
Ogrezeni water treatment plants). All service infrastructure and equipment is, in principle, municipal&#13;
property. Investment execution is managed by the Bucharest municipality as the recipient of the&#13;
investment grants, though some delegation of responsibilities to RGAB has occasionally occurred in recent&#13;
years. RGAB attempts to break away from the dependency on exclusive government investment funding&#13;
and to finance rehabilitation programs from its own resources. It has, in particular, been able to fund&#13;
the acquisition and installation of water meters to larger institutional and industrial consumers, as well&#13;
the implementation of leak-detection campaigns by private operators. However, given the state of its&#13;
finances, its access to commercial credit remains to date extremely limited.&#13;
C. Issues of Sector Development Strategy&#13;
1.19         General Issues: As mentioned above (see para. 1.5), the provision of local public&#13;
services in Romania is a direct responsibility of municipalities and the central government plays, in&#13;
2   At the end of June 1996 exchange rate of USS I = ROL 3000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
principle, only a monitoring role. However, because many decentralization issues have not yet been&#13;
resolved, the actual ability of local governments to decide on questions of service organization is&#13;
extremely limited. To eliminate existing ambiguities and fill critical gaps amendments to the local&#13;
government legislation issued in 1991 were made in April 1996. Also, in keeping with its reform&#13;
program for public enterprises that aims at restoring financial discipline in their management and&#13;
enhancing their profitability, the Government introduced in 1993 legislation (Law 66/93) that made&#13;
mandatory for all RAs the preparation of management contracts linking the pay of the managers to their&#13;
performance, assessed according to a set of previously negotiated and agreed performance criteria.&#13;
1.20          The Government and the Bucharest municipality recognize that there is a need for&#13;
substantial changes to be brought into the institutional setup and policies regulating the provision of&#13;
municipal services. In response to 1994 legislation that mandated extensive organizational changes in the&#13;
system of local RAs, the Bucharest municipality is studying a redesign of the framework of the legal and&#13;
financial relationships with the RAs operating under its supervision (RGAB, RATB, RADET), and how&#13;
to contract out to private operators a certain number of its services and, in particular, solid waste&#13;
collection. RGAB itself has started in 1995 to restructure its management organization in order to make&#13;
itself more responsive to the needs of a company run along commercial and customer-oriented principles&#13;
and its general director is performing under a management contract arrangement since end of 1995.&#13;
1.21          Financing of Sector Investment. Investment decisions for local utilities are made by&#13;
the central govermnent authorities in consultation with the recipient municipalities as well as the&#13;
beneficiary RAs. To date, investments are selected primarily according to their technical merits with a&#13;
generally modest regaid for economic considerations, including whether they represent the least-cost&#13;
solution in terns of capital expenditure or the resulting operational costs for the beneficiary. Another&#13;
drawback of the current sys.em of financing is that frequently projects are started without any guarantee&#13;
that the required resources will be available over time when needed and, as a result, an excessive amount&#13;
of time is needed for their completion. The shortcomings of these policies are illustrated by the cases&#13;
of two major investment operations for the Bucharest area, the Glina waste water treatment plant&#13;
(estimated cost US$ 220 million equivalent) and the Crivina-Ogrezeni water treatment plant (estimated&#13;
cost US$ 100 million equivalent) that were started in 1985 and 1986, respectively, but are still far from&#13;
completion.&#13;
1.22          The full rehabilitation of the entire water and sewerage system in Bucharest (excluding&#13;
waste water treatment) would require investments of over US$ 500 million equivalent, at 1995 prices,&#13;
according to studies carried out for the preparation of the proposed project. RGAB and the Bucharest&#13;
municipality are aware that such amounts are not affordable presently, and that a comprehensive overhaul&#13;
of management practices is warranted. In particular, incentives for a more conmmercially oriented&#13;
management must be introduced as a first step to ensure that available resources are used efficiently.&#13;
However, in line with the Government's general political strategy, the Bucharest municipality is opting&#13;
for a gradual approach to reforms rather than an immediate and wholesale restructuring of the local&#13;
services sector. The proposed project will lead to a clear departure from past procedures of infrastructure&#13;
financing for local utilities and introduce, for the first time, an explicit linkage between investment costs,&#13;
affordability, and the operator's capacity to assume the corresponding financial obligations.&#13;
1.23          Private sector involvement in the delivery of local public services is still limited in&#13;
Romania. Some small-scale attempts are being made in sectors such as solid waste collection, where&#13;
operations can easily be fragmented and the intervention of private operators is facilitated. The water&#13;
supply and sewerage sector, however, is unlikely to elicit a major private sector interest in the medium-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
term for three main reasons: (a) the need to develop the trust in the political commitment to assign the&#13;
delivery of vital public services to private sector operators, create the necessary regulatory capacity, and&#13;
allow a liberalization of tariffs; (b) the lack of reliable data on (i) the technical and financial performance&#13;
of RGAB, (ii) the ownership and value of its fixed assets, (iii) the present and likely future demand for&#13;
water, and (iv) the physical condition of the system and the likely costs of its rehabilitation; and (c) the&#13;
uncertainty still surrounding the future development of the economy and the ensuing question whether&#13;
and to which extent needed price increases would be affordable and politically acceptable.&#13;
1.24          RGAB's Development Strategy: The strategy developed by RGAB, which is supported&#13;
by the Government and the Bucharest municipality, for overcoming the water supply problems in&#13;
Bucharest and improving the enterprise's operational and financial performance represents an important&#13;
break with past policies that tried to resolve shortfalls in service quality by investing in increased&#13;
production capacity.  RGAB's strategy focusses on rehabilitation and maintenance of existing&#13;
infrastructure and reduction of water production and distribution costs and pursues two major objectives:&#13;
first, to progressively reduce RGAB's large water losses (and corresponding operating costs) by&#13;
(a) improving the maintenance and intensifying the rehabilitation of the existing network; and (b) through&#13;
the shift from the flat-rate billing of a theoretical consumption to the billing of the metered actual&#13;
consumption creating the financial incentives for consumers to opt for a more rational use of water.&#13;
second, to improve the efficiency of RGAB's operations by (a) strengthening the enterprise's&#13;
technical, financial and commercial management functions and restructuring it along conmmercial and&#13;
consumer-oriented business principles, and (b) streamlining the cost of RGAB's operations to ensure the&#13;
provision of water at affordable tariffs, and create the conditions that could facilitate, in the longer-term,&#13;
a possible involvement of private sector operators.&#13;
D. Role of the Bank and Lending Strategy&#13;
1.25          The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Romania, discussed by the Board of&#13;
Directors on April 5, 1994, during the presentation of the Romania Petroleum Sector Rehabilitation&#13;
Project (Loan 3723-RO) aims primarily at supporting the Govermnent's structural adjustment program&#13;
and macro-economic stabilization objectives. It also identifies rehabilitation of infrastructure as one of&#13;
the priority areas for Bank lending. The Bank's support of the strategy has been materialized through&#13;
the Technical Assistance and Critical Imports Project (Loan 3363-RO) which financed studies for the&#13;
restructuring of the railway sector and urban transport in Bucharest, the Transport (Road Rehabilitation)&#13;
Project (Loan 3593-RO), and the Railway Rehabilitation Project presented to the Board on January 18,&#13;
1996.  Important issues of public utility management were addressed under the Power Sector&#13;
Rehabilitation and Modernization Project presented to the Board on August 29, 1995, and the Financial&#13;
and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan (FESAL) presented to the Board on January 18, 1996.&#13;
1.26         The proposed project is consistent with the objectives of the CAS and in line with the&#13;
strategy options adopted for the other above mentioned infrastructure sector projects. It is based on&#13;
studies initiated as an outcome of the Bank's ESW in Fall 1990 summarized in the ESW Report&#13;
'Romania: The Challenge of Transition' (Report No. 9497-RO). It has also benefitted from informal&#13;
sector work on local government development issues that was carried out in 1992.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
E. Bank Experience in the Sector and Lessons Learned&#13;
1.27          The project is the Bank's first operation in the water sector in Romania and, thus, cannot&#13;
build up on previous experience. Bank experience in other transition economy countries is also limited&#13;
to date, and consists primarily of operations that are in start-up phase and do not yet allow any conclusion&#13;
as to their implementation performance. Involvement of other donors in the Romania water thus far has&#13;
been modest, too. EBRD is currently funding a Municipal Utilities Project (US$ 28 million equivalent)&#13;
for five of the largest secondary cities that was signed in Spring 1995 and which finances rehabilitation&#13;
of water supply and waste water treatment. It has also has started the preparation of a second operation&#13;
of similar size and scope. Other, bilaterally funded operations include ongoing studies for water supply&#13;
and sewerage rehabilitation in various secondary cities.&#13;
1.28          In designing the project, attention was paid to general Bank experience in the water and&#13;
sanitation sector. A 1995 OED Water Sector Report as well as other Bank surveys have concluded that&#13;
although projects have often been successful in achieving their physical objectives, in general, limited&#13;
succ,ess has been obtained in improving the institutional performance of the utilities. Some of the reasons&#13;
for the less than optimal results were: (i) inadequate linkages between physical and institutional objectives;&#13;
(ii) lack of management and financial autonomy of local utilities; (iii) staff inexperience in project&#13;
implementation and institutional problem solving; (iv) project complexity; (v) lack of reliable information&#13;
on production and consumption patterns that prevented the design of well-focused unaccounted-for-water&#13;
reduction prograrns and adequate tariff structures; and (vi) problems related to cost recovery and timely&#13;
provision of counterpart funds.&#13;
1.29         These lessons have been incorporated, to the extent feasible, into the design of the project&#13;
in the following way:&#13;
(a)    project components were selected linking physical improvements with the implementation&#13;
of institutional, technical and financial measures to improve RGAB's management,&#13;
productivity, financial self-sufficiency and expertise in project implementation;&#13;
(b)    strong support for the project at the level of the central government, the Bucharest&#13;
municipality and RGAB as the implementing agency, was sought at an early stage of&#13;
project preparation;&#13;
(c)    special attention was given to RGAB's overall financial situation and to set realistic&#13;
financial targets, taking into account the constraints for tariff increases stemming from&#13;
the overall economic conditions;&#13;
(d)    simplicity in project design was sought in view of RGAB's lack of familiarity with Bank&#13;
preparation and implementation procedures;&#13;
(e)    strengthening the commercial management together with implementation of a metering&#13;
program will enable RGAB to monitor its production and acquire a better understanding&#13;
of the demand and consumption patterns of its customers; and&#13;
(f)    support to public awareness development will build up on, and complement, previous&#13;
efforts deployed by RGAB and the Bucharest municipality to better understand customer&#13;
satisfaction with local public services and benefit from the experience already acquired.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Origin&#13;
2.1           The proposed project was identified in February 1995 after discussions with officials of&#13;
the Government, the Bucharest mumnicipality, and RGAB.  Preparation of feasibility studies was&#13;
undertaken with fund.ng from the Japanese PHRD Grant TF 20515 (Bucharest Water Supply and&#13;
Sewerage Rehabilitation). Complementary technical assistance for project preparation was provided&#13;
through the Japanese PHRD Grant TF 23063 (Local Government Development). Preappraisal was carried&#13;
out in June 1995, followed by appraisal in December 1995. Negotiations were held in Washington from&#13;
June 10 to 14, 1996.&#13;
2.2           The outline and general concept of the proposed project was approved by the Board of&#13;
Administrators of RGAB on June 22, 1995 and officially endorsed by the Municipal Council of Bucharest&#13;
on October 6, 1995, (CLMB Decision 81/95). It was approved by the Government on March 21, 1996,&#13;
(Government Decision 181/96).&#13;
B. Project Rationale and Objectives&#13;
2.3           The amount of financial resources that would be required for a full rehabilitation of the&#13;
entire Bucharest water supply and sewerage is in excess of US$ 500 million equivalent (para. 1.21).&#13;
However, rather than engage in the preparation of a large-scale and complex operation, the Bank and the&#13;
Romania Government, together with the Bucharest municipality and RGAB, have agreed to opt for a step-&#13;
by-step approach that would consist of a series of separate, sequential projects over a multi-year period.&#13;
Each of these projects would build up on, and benefit from, the preceding operations' institutional&#13;
achievements and implementation experience and allow to tailor the size, timing, and design features of&#13;
these successive projects to the pace of improvement in RGAB's technical and financial performance, its&#13;
compliance with project conditionality, and the evolution of the country's economic and institutional&#13;
context. The primary reasons that justify such a 'widening circle' approach are that:&#13;
(a)   thus far, RGAB has not had any significant experience with the preparation and&#13;
implementation of operations funded from external sources and its project management&#13;
capacity needs to be progressively built-up;&#13;
(b)    without further real tariff increases that are unlikely to be politically and socially&#13;
acceptable at this point RGAB can only afford a relatively small project. Tariff increases&#13;
will become unavoidable in the longer terrn, however, and it is expected that the display&#13;
under the proposed project of a first visible effort to improve water supply conditions,&#13;
together with a public outreach program supported by the project, will create the climate&#13;
that will facilitate such future tariff increases. Furthermore, there is also a potential for&#13;
a significant rationalization of RGAB's operational expenditures, that must (and will&#13;
under the proposed project) be explored before raising tariffs any further; and&#13;
(c)    RGAB's current financial position is weak and needs to be strengthened before any&#13;
significant expansion of its financial commitments can be considered. Likewise, RGAB's&#13;
basic managerial informations lack the reliability and relevance required for an efficient&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
management and must be thoroughly overhauled to allow RGAB to achieve a better&#13;
operational and financial performance and expand its investments.&#13;
2.4           Given the constraints described above, the scope and size of the proposed project have&#13;
deliberately been kept narrow to create the framework for a successful project implementation. The&#13;
project's objectives would be to finance the execution of a three-year program of investments that have&#13;
been identified as the highest priority to:&#13;
(a)    improve the reliability and quality of water supply in Bucharest;&#13;
(b)    start to reduce water losses (both physical and commercial); and&#13;
(c)    strengthen RGAB's operational, commercial and financial management and help it acquire&#13;
the expertise necessary for the preparation and implementation of future operations.&#13;
2.5           The relatively narrow focus of the proposed operation reflects a concern for simplicity&#13;
in design since the project will be carried out by a beneficiary without prior experience in the&#13;
implementation of such projects. Lack of complexi.y will permit an easier implementation and allow&#13;
RGAB to rapidly display a visible and concrete effort to improve the living conditions of the Bucharest&#13;
population. This will also help further the dialogue with the Government and municipal authorities on&#13;
issues of local utility management, which has already seen a fruitful beginning. For these reasons,&#13;
components for waste water collection and treatment that are more complex and require more intensive&#13;
scrutiny have been deferred, in agreement with the Government and RGAB, to a future operation.&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
2.6           The proposed project will include the following components:&#13;
A.            Improvement of Water Supplv Reliability and Quality (33% of base project cost)&#13;
(a)    Water treatment plant rehabilitation, including the repair and/or replacement of filters,&#13;
and installation of new chlorination and chemical treatment equipment for existing&#13;
treatment plants;&#13;
(b)    Aqueduct flow control improvement and reservoir upgrading, including the purchase and&#13;
installation of flow control valves and flow meters at key locations of the network; and&#13;
(c)    Pumping station rehabilitation, including the acquisition and installation of new high&#13;
energy efficiency pumps, the rehabilitation of existing pumps and electrical equipment,&#13;
and the installation of flow control equipment for several key pumping stations.&#13;
B.            Reduction of Water Losses (57% of base project cost)&#13;
(a)    Primary network repair, including the replacem-.ent of deteriorated network sections,&#13;
survey and repair and/or replacement of distribution valves as well as the reconstitution&#13;
of a minimum stock of essential spare parts;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I1&#13;
(b)    Secondary network rehabilitation, including the repair and/or replacement of elements of&#13;
the secondary network including house connections in several city neighborhoods with&#13;
above average water losses and reported breaks; and&#13;
(c)    Metering program, including the purchase and installation of meters of different sizes for&#13;
larger consumers such as housing development authorities and commercial enterprises.&#13;
C.            Institutional Strengthening of RGAB (9% of base project cost)&#13;
(a)    Public awareness and water wastage reduction campaign, including the preparation and&#13;
implementation of media campaigns (press, radio, TV) to sensitize the public on water&#13;
conservation issues and the study of measures to provide incentives to consumers for&#13;
reducing excessive water consumption; as well as preparation of a tariff study including&#13;
the identification of possible financial incentives for water consumption reduction;&#13;
(b)    Improvement of RGAB's customur accounts management system, including technical&#13;
assistance to pursue the reorganization efforts initiated with technical assistance&#13;
provided, as of January 1996, by the French Government under a bilateral agreement;&#13;
(c)    Training and other technical assistance, including training for RGAB staff to acquire&#13;
and/or develop management skills in the areas of finance and accounting, human resource&#13;
management, and technical operations. Complementary technical assistance (not included&#13;
in project costs) is provided under the Danube River Basin Environmental Program; and&#13;
(d)    Implementation supervision, including consulting services to assist RGAB  in the&#13;
management of project execution.&#13;
A detailed description of project components is contained in Annex 5. 1.&#13;
D. Cost Estimates&#13;
2.7           The total project cost (including contingencies, taxes and duties) is estimated to be about&#13;
US$ 50 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$ 25.4 million equivalent or about&#13;
50% of the total project cost. Cost estimates were prepared by the consultant SAFEGE/LOTTI on the&#13;
basis of quantity estimates from substantially completed design studies, and using unit prices from similar&#13;
projects under implementation either in Romania or other countries. A detailed analysis of costs has been&#13;
made to determine the foreign exchange component and local costs. All project costs have been estimated&#13;
in US Dollars on the basis of December 1995 prices at the mid-December 1995 exchange rate of ROL&#13;
2,550 per US$ 1. Import duties (15%), VAT (18% of total costs) and other incidental taxes are included&#13;
in the local component. Physical contingencies (5% for equipment, 10% for civil works) have been&#13;
added to cover possible increases in quantities. Price contingencies have been applied to base costs&#13;
following the Bank's expected price increases as per OP 6.50 of October 1995,(1996: 3.3%; 1997: 2.3%;&#13;
1998: 2.5%; 199: 2.5%) with the assumption that the exchange rate will adjust to the evolution of&#13;
domestic prices and external inflation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Note: some figures may not add up due to rounding.&#13;
E. Project Financing Arrangements&#13;
2.9               The financing plan of the project is summarized in Table 2 below. The Bank will finance&#13;
US$ 25 million of the project's total foreign cost estimated at US$ 25.4 million or about 51 % of total&#13;
project costs. 3 Local counterpart financing will be provided, as a grant, for about US$ 15 million&#13;
equivalent (or 30% of total project cost) from the central government budget and about US$ 7.5 million&#13;
3   The proposed cost-sharing: IBRD 50 % / Romania 50%  is consistent with the cost-sharing arrangements adopted for&#13;
EBRD's Municipal Utilities loan signed on April 9, 1995 for the rehabilitation of water supply and sewerage infrastructure&#13;
in five major Romanian secondary cities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
equivalent frorr the Bucharest municipal budget (15 % of total project cost). RGAB will contribute about&#13;
US$ 2.5 million from its own annual budgetary resources (5% of total project cost).&#13;

2.10          The Borrower for the loan will be Romania. At the Borrower's request, the loan will be&#13;
made at the Bank's standard variable rate for LIBOR-based US Dollar Single Currency Loans at the&#13;
Bank's standard conditions for Romania (20 years, including five years of grace). Loan proceeds will&#13;
be on-lent by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), with a guarantee from the Bucharest municipality, to&#13;
RGAB on the basis of a Subsidiary Loan and Guarantee Agreement. The Agreement of MOF, the&#13;
Bucharest municipality and RGAB on the on-lending arrangement was confirmed at negotiations fsee para.&#13;
6.1(a)1. Signature of the on-lending agreement will be a condition for loan effectiveness fsee para.&#13;
6.2(a)]. On-lending will be made in foreign currency at the IBRD variable interest rate. RGAB would&#13;
carry the foreign exchange and interest rate risks. The contributions from the central government and&#13;
the Bucharest municipality budgets, respectively, will be made through annual appropriations in&#13;
accordance with Romanian public finance procedures. During negotiations an understanding was reached&#13;
with the Government, the Bucharest municipality, and RGAB on the funding arrangements for the local&#13;
counterpart contribution.&#13;
F. Environmental Aspects&#13;
2.11          For the purpose of O.D. 4.01 on Environmental Impact Assessment the Project has been&#13;
classified as Category B, which requires a limited environmental review to determine potential negative&#13;
environmental impacts and propose mitigation measures where needed, as well as to identify opportunities&#13;
for environmental enhancement. Such a review has been carried out during project appraisal by RGAB&#13;
and Bank experts [see Annex 11.&#13;
2.12          The project will have relatively minor negative environmental effects and will not raise&#13;
any resettlement or property rights issues since it focuses primarily on rehabilitation of existing network&#13;
and facilities.  All works will be executed either within the premises of existing facilities or the rights&#13;
of way of the public street network. The project will not affect any archeological or historical site.&#13;
Contractors will be responsible, under the clauses of the bidding documents, for keeping worksites pollu-&#13;
tion free, returning sites to their original conditions, and minimizing dust, noise and other work-related&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
nuisances. They will also be responsible for notification of the discovery of, or any problem related to,&#13;
a previously unknown historical site. The project will have no impact on the flow regime of the Arges&#13;
and Dimbovila rivers nor will it affect the quality of their waters through increased water abstraction or&#13;
waste water discharges and, therefore, does not require a notification for the purposes of OD.7.50.&#13;
2.13          The project is expected to bring significant environmental, as well as health, benefits&#13;
from. (i) reducing water losses in the distribution network; (ii) assuring better drinking water quality&#13;
from improved operation and maintenance of the drinking water plants and elimination of point-&#13;
contamination sources in the distribution network; (iii) better handling of residuals from drinking water&#13;
treatment; and (iv) increased energy efficiency of water supply distribution. To improve its operational&#13;
day-to-day environmental management (sludge management; handling of chemicals and toxic substances;&#13;
improvements in the operation and maintenance of the sewerage network, including improved emergency&#13;
response; more efficient use of information from the existing water quality monitoring networks; and&#13;
better compliance with environmental regulations), RGAB will create an environmental advisory position&#13;
and appoint an environmental advisor to the general director. During negotiations RGAB confirmed that&#13;
it would appoint an environmental advisor by January 1. 1997 at the latest under terms of reference&#13;
reviewed, and found satisfactory. by the Bank Isee para. 6. 1(b)l.&#13;
2.14          Moreover, the project will support RGAB's efforts to encourage water conservation&#13;
through the extension of metering to all major consumers and the implementation of an awareness&#13;
campaign. The purpose of the latter, for which complementary support from the Danube River Basin&#13;
Environmental Program is being provided, is to raise public awareness of the need to manage water&#13;
resources more carefully through the preparation of advertising campaigns in different media (press,&#13;
radio, TV, billboards, etc.) and the development of educational programs for kindergartens and primary&#13;
schools [see Annex 5.7(b)1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND SUPERVISION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A. Organization and Management&#13;
3.1           The project will be executed by RGAB as the sole implementing agency. As such, RGAB&#13;
will assume direct obligations towards the Bank on all matters under its jurisdiction. RGAB has set up&#13;
a project coordination unit (PCU) and has hired appropriately skilled Romanian staff. The PCU reports&#13;
directly to the general director of RGAB and has a non-hierarchical relationship with RGAB's four main&#13;
departments: commercial (customer account management) services, finances and accounting, technical&#13;
services, and human resources [see para. 1.14 and Chart Al, and coordinates their participation in project&#13;
implementation. Technical assistance has been recruited under funding from a Japanese PHRD Grant to&#13;
train local specialists in matters of procurement and project coordination prior to project preparation&#13;
completion. To compensate for its current lack of expertise in project implementation management, the&#13;
PCU would be supported, throughout project implementation, by a team of adequately experienced&#13;
technical assistance experts [see para. 3.8]. Additionally, technical assistance will be provided to RGAB&#13;
to help it train its technical staff in the operation of the facilities upgraded under the project, and monitor&#13;
and evaluate the effects of the network rehabilitation program [see Annex 5.7(c)1.&#13;
3.2           The PCU will review and follow-up on procurement procedures and bidding documents,&#13;
monitor and coorcdinate every aspect of project implementation (including procurement). The PCU will&#13;
prepare detailed work schedules and coordinate project activities in accordance with Terms of Reference&#13;
agreed with the Bank [see Annex 5.7(a)1. The PCU will also be responsible for preparing and submitting&#13;
quarterly reports on project implementation performance to the Bank and the Romanian authorities&#13;
according to an agreed Reporting Plan [see Annex 5.61. During negotiations RGAB confirmed that PCU&#13;
will remain in operation and be satisfactorily staffed and funded through the project implementation [see&#13;
para. 6. 1(c)1. Agreement was also reached on the project implementation schedule, monitoring criteria.&#13;
and reporting arrangements [see para. 6. 1(d) and Annex 5.61.&#13;
3.3           The target implementation scenario for the project is that it would be executed over a&#13;
period of about three years and completed by December 31, 1999. The project's Implementation Plan&#13;
(PIP) is shown in Annex 5.3. The loan will close on June 30, 2000, six months after the project&#13;
completion date. The approval procedures required by the Romania Government for all investments&#13;
funded totally or partially with central or local government resources are relatively complex and there&#13;
is a risk that this could lead to possible delays. In order to avoid such delays, an early clearance of&#13;
bidding documents was warranted and completion of four bidding packages for ICB procured contracts&#13;
was sought as a condition for Board Presentation.&#13;
B. Procurement&#13;
3.4           Procurement arrangements for the elements of the project, their estimated cost and&#13;
proposed methods of procurement are summarized in Table 3 below. A detailed list of contracts to be&#13;
concluded is contained in the Project Procurement Plan [see Annex 5.21.&#13;
3.5           All goods, works and services to be financed from the loan proceeds will be procured in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement (January 1995), including amendments as of the&#13;
loan signing date, using the Bank standard bidding documents. Consulting Services will be procured in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
accordance with the Guidelines for use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank&#13;
as Executing Agency (August 1981), including possible amendments as of the loan signing date. A&#13;
Country Procurement Assessment Report will be completed by June 1997. The laws and regulations&#13;
governing national procurement procedures and practices in Romania are being reviewed in the Bank in&#13;
order to establish whether national procedures are acceptable for Bank-financed contracts. A 'General&#13;
Procurement Notice' containing information about bidding opportunities (for procurement on the basis&#13;
of ICB) has been published in the April 16, 1996 issue of the 'Development Business' in accordance with&#13;
paras. 2.7 and 2.8 of the Bank Guidelines for Procurement, January 1995. Prequalification documents&#13;
were completed as a condition for negotiation. A project launching workshop will be held prior to&#13;
implementation start-up expected for September 1996.&#13;

3.6              Civil Works. Civi1 works contracts (including supply of necessary goods and equipment)&#13;
for the rehabilitation of water treatment plants and primary and secondary network repair (about US$ 26.5&#13;
million) will be carried out under ICB with prequalification. They would be procured in seven packages&#13;
[see Annex 5.21. Four of these contracts (secondary network repair and replacement, about US$ 19.3&#13;
million) will be advertised and procured on a slice-and-package basis. Romanian firms with adequate&#13;
experience are likely to enter into joint venture agreements with foreign contractors in order to bid. For&#13;
all ICB contracts prequalification of firms will be required. Contracts of less than US$ 10 million&#13;
equivalent will be procured using the Bank's standard bidding document for civil works (smaller&#13;
contracts). Civil works for meter installation will be carried out under National Competitive Bidding&#13;
(NCB) procedures through at least four separate contracts with an aggregate value not to exceed US$ 2.0&#13;
million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
3.7           Goods and Supply and Installation. Goods to be financed from the Bank loan (about&#13;
US$ 5.5 million) consisting of filtering equipment, water meters, accessories and complementary&#13;
equipment will, to over 85%, be procured through ICB. They will be procured in four packages [see&#13;
Annex 5.21. Romanian manufacturers competing for the contracts for the supply of goods procured under&#13;
ICB procedures will receive a preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent of the CIF price or the&#13;
prevailing custom duty applicable to non-exempt importers, whichever is less, provided they can prove&#13;
to the satisfaction o- the Borrower and the Bank that the manufacturing cost of such goods includes more&#13;
than 30 percent of 'ocally procured labor, raw materials and components. National Competitive Bidding&#13;
(NCB) will be used for the procurement of filtering sand (US$ 300,000). International Shopping (IS)&#13;
based on a comparison of price quotations obtained from at least three suppliers from at least two eligible&#13;
countries will be used for the procurement filter nozzles (US$ 300,000).  Supply and Installation&#13;
procurement (US$ 11.6 million) will be used for two contracts for (a) the rehabilitation of pumping&#13;
stations and (b) the installation of flow control equipment on the primary network. Bidding for these&#13;
contracts will be carried out through ICB on the basis of prequalification and, given the adequate&#13;
preparation of technical specifications, one-stage bidding for supply and installation contracts using the&#13;
Bank standard contract for Supply and Installation.&#13;
3.8           Consultant services. Consultant services estimated at US$ 4.5 million for technical&#13;
assistance and training will be carried out by qualified and experienced consulting firms and individual&#13;
consultants appointed in accordance with Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August 1981).&#13;
Consulting services will be required to assist (a) RGAB's PCU in project implementation management&#13;
[see para 3.1]; (b) RGAB in the management improvement of its customer accounts system [see para.&#13;
4.131 and operating systems [see para. 3.11; and (d) the preparation of a public awareness campaign [see&#13;
para 2.14]. A detailed description of the consulting services to be procured is contained in the Project&#13;
Implementation Plan [see Annex 5.21. Available local expertise should allow for the participation of&#13;
Romanian experts in consulting assignments under the project. Unless otherwise agreed, all individual&#13;
contracts will be awarded on the basis of comparison of at least three curricula vitae for each selection&#13;
of consultant (see para. 3.9 below) and will be limited to assignments of short duration and requiring&#13;
specialized expertise.&#13;
3.9           Prior Review. All contracts exceeding US$ 250,000 (more than 80% of total project&#13;
cost), and all contracts for consultant services valued in excess of US$ 100,000 for firms and US$ 50,000&#13;
for individual consultants will be subject to prior review and approval by the Bank. Contracts of a lesser&#13;
amount would be subject to ex-post review by Bank supervision missions. Likewise, terms of reference&#13;
for all consultant contracts will be reviewed in advance by the Bank. Procurement information will be&#13;
included in the quarterly project progress reports to be prepared by RGAB [see para. 3.2 and Annex 5.61.&#13;
During negotiations, an understanding was reached with the Government and RGAB on all procurement&#13;
arrangements, including the list of contract packages and the procurement timetable.&#13;
C. Disbursements&#13;
3.10          The proposed Bank loan will be disbursed against the different categories of project&#13;
elements as shown in Table 4 below.&#13;
3.11          Withdrawal applications for contracts for civil works and goods above US$ 250,000,&#13;
consulting firms above US$ 100,000 and individual consultants above US$ 50,000 will be fully&#13;
documented and for contracts for less than these amounts will be made on the basis of Statements of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
Expenditures (SOE). Documnentation to support expenditure financed under SOE will be maintained by&#13;
the Borrower in one location and made available upon request for review by Bank representatives in&#13;
addition to being audited by the auditors [see para. 3.16 and para. 4.19].  Agreement on these&#13;
arrangements was obtained from the Government and RGAB during negotiations [see para. 6. l(e)l.&#13;

3.13            To maintain an adequate flow of funds for eligible project expenditure with a minimum&#13;
of administrative delay, the Borrower will establish a Special Account with an authorized allocation of&#13;
US$ 2.0 million at a bank of its choice acceptable to the Bank. The initial deposit of the authorized&#13;
allocation will be limited to US$ 1.0 million and the remaining portion of the authorized allocation would&#13;
be released when disbursements reach a level of US$ 3.0 million. Applications for replenishment of the&#13;
Special Account will be submitted on a monthly basis or when one third of the amount deposited has been&#13;
withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. All applications for direct payment or special commitments must&#13;
be for an amount not less than 20%  of the initial deposit of the authorized allocation to the Special&#13;
Account or not less than 20 % of the full authorized allocation once available. In addition to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
documcntation mentioned above, all replenishment applications would be accompanied by monthly bank&#13;
statements of the Special Account which have been reconciled by the Borrower. Records of the Special&#13;
Account proceeds and outlays will be available for review by the Bank's supervision mission and subject&#13;
to anuual audit (see para. 4.18). During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government and&#13;
RGAB on all Special Account management and disbursement arrangements [see para. 6. 1(e)1.&#13;
D. Project Monitoring, Supervision, and Auditing&#13;
3.14          A Project Implementation Plan (PIP) has been prepared jointly with RGAB to ensure a&#13;
shared understanding of the project activities to be carried out and their timing [see Annex 51. The&#13;
compliance with the PIP will be monitored by the PCU project coordinator and the Bank on the base of&#13;
monitoring indicators shown in Annex 5.5.&#13;
3.15          In addition to direct monitoring and assistance on day-to-day matters which will be&#13;
provided by the Resident Mission in Romania, about 20 staff/weeks per year of headquarter staff input&#13;
will be reqjuired over the life of the project. Supervision missions staff should include a water sector&#13;
specialist, financial analyst and institutional experts. Although, because of the short duration of the&#13;
project, a full mid-term review would not be warranted, a project implementation progress review will&#13;
be carried out about eightecn months after project implementation start-up with a view to take stock of&#13;
project achievements, agree on remedial action, if necessary, and determine the prospects for the&#13;
preparation of a follow-up project, identify the most important issues such an operation should.address&#13;
and decide on its content and timing. During negotiations, agreement on the scope and timing of the&#13;
proiect implementation progress review was obtained [see para. 4.18 and para. 6. 1(f)1.&#13;
3.16          RGAB will establish a separate Project Account and maintain it according to accepted&#13;
international accounting standards, in order to ensure that the flow of funds associated with the project&#13;
can be identified and tracked. The Project Account, together with the Special Account and SOEs [see&#13;
para. 3. 11 and para. 3.13] will be subject to annual audit by qualified independent auditors acceptable&#13;
to the Bank and in accordance with international accounting auditing procedures. Audit reports will be&#13;
submitted to the Bank within six months of the close of each fiscal year [see para. 4.19]. Agreement on&#13;
the auditing arrangements for the Special Account and the Proiect Account was confirmed at negotiations&#13;
[see para. 6.1(e) and para 6.1(i)1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

IV. FINANCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS&#13;
A. General Aspects&#13;
4.1            In line with the prevailing financing practices for local water utilities in Romania, RGAB&#13;
is only expected to cover its current expenditures (including maintenance) through revenues from water&#13;
and sewerage services [see para. 1.16]. All water supply and sewerage investments are financed from&#13;
the State budget through annual fiscal grants to the Bucharest municipal budget, the remainder, if any,&#13;
being financed from the Bucharest municipality's own resources. Unlike other RAs providing local&#13;
services in Bucharest (RADET, RATB), RGAB receives no subsidy for its operations. It relies&#13;
ex-lusively on service proceeds as a source of funding for its operational expenditures. As a result of&#13;
this policy, RGAB has currently no long-term debts and its only liabilities are with suppliers. Thus, if&#13;
properly managed, RGAB has the potential capacity to borrow in order to fund a reasonable proportion&#13;
of its investment needs.&#13;
B. RGAB's Past Financial Performance&#13;
4.2            Overall Results. RGAB's financial performance since its creation in 1990 has been less&#13;
than satisfactory as a result of inadequate tariff and bill collection policies and practices:&#13;
First, in the more recent years RGAB's revenues have not been sufficient to adequately&#13;
cover the utility's operating costs. According to RGAB's accounting records, the amounts billed in 1992&#13;
zind 1993 (about ROL 9 billion and ROL 21 billion, respectively, or US$ 25 million and US$ 28 million&#13;
equivalent) 4 were roughly equivalent to the total operating costs each year; in 1994 losses amounted to&#13;
over ROL 6 billion, or the equivalent of over US$ 3 million, but in 1995 losses decreased (prior to extra-&#13;
o1dinary income) to ROL 0.6 billion or about US$ 0.3 million. I It has to be noted, however, that the&#13;
above figures provide a rather optimistic picture of RGAB's performance because the company's&#13;
accounting practices underestimate its operating costs and, thus, overestimate its net income. Important&#13;
among these practices are those that relate to depreciation charges and accounts receivable.  The&#13;
depreciation charges from 1992 to 1994 were calculated on non-revalued fixed assets and were negligible&#13;
(the estimated 1995 financial statements include adequate depreciation charges). No provision was made&#13;
for losses on accounts receivable during the whole 1992-95 period despite the unsatisfactory bill collection&#13;
performance. These practices are closely regulated by the Government, however, and RGAB, in these&#13;
matters, has been complying with existing accounting regulations in Romania. The financial statements&#13;
in Annex 2 contain complementary details on RGAB's financial performance.&#13;
Second, a large proportion of RGAB's assets are worn down owing to the insufficient&#13;
allocation of financial resources to preventive maintenance and renewal of the existing infrastructure and&#13;
equipment. This fact has serious negative implications on RGAB's ability to continue providing services&#13;
to its customers at an acceptable level of quality and, if not corrected promptly, would result in a further&#13;
deterioration of RGAB's finances.&#13;
4   All Romanian currency amounts indicated in this chapter are in current ROL. All US$ equivalents are at the average&#13;
exchange rates for the corresponding years for revenues and expenditures and at the end-of-the year exchange rates for&#13;
balance statement data.&#13;
1995 figures are still provisional and unaudited but were prepared in accordance with Romanian regulations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
Third, bill collection by RGAB has been negatively affected by the weak performance&#13;
of the economy, in general, and by the financial problems encountered by public sector enterprises, in&#13;
particular. The problem has been compounded by the lack, or inadequate implementation, of sanctions&#13;
to customers for delays in payment of bills. Between 1992 and 1994 collection rates stood at around 75 %&#13;
of the amounts billed each year, but dropped to 68% in 1995 (for definition of collection rate see para.&#13;
4.13). By the end of 1995, accounts receivable were at about ROL 34 billion (about US$ 13 million&#13;
equivalent at Lhe end-of-the year exchange rate) or about four months of billings.&#13;
4.3           An additional problem is that the above figures mask the fact that RGAB has suffered&#13;
significant financial losses from delayed collection of bills without penalties or adjustments in an&#13;
inflationary environment. A significant proportion of receivables is older than six months and due from&#13;
public sector entities. By law, penalties for late payments are fixed at 0.5% per day for the amount in&#13;
arrears with the provision that the total accumulated amount of penalties cannot exceed the amount of the&#13;
original bill. Such penalties are rarely applied, though. RGAB is also authorized to cut off water supply&#13;
to customers that are forty or more days in arrears, but for a variety of reasons, it has, so far, rarely&#13;
resorted to this measure. The arrears issue is endemic to the public sector enterprise sector in Romania&#13;
and can only be addressed effectively through a comprehensive program to restore and promote financial&#13;
discipline - which is one of the objectives of the recently approved FESAL [see para. 1.2]. Actions to&#13;
reduce accounts receivable are part of the three-year Short-Term Action Program (STAP) included in the&#13;
project [see para. 4.12]. The technical assistance currently provided to RGAB under a French bilateral&#13;
program will be continued under the project and is expected to significantly help improve the procedures&#13;
for collecting bills and managing arrears.&#13;
4.4           Unsatisfactory bill collections have resulted in significant cash shortfalls, which RGAB&#13;
(like other RAs) has routinely compensated by delaying payments to its key suppliers, in particular to&#13;
RENELI for power consumption and to APELE ROMANE for water abstraction. By the end of 1994,&#13;
GAB's accounts due to RENEL and APELE ROMANE amounted to the equivalent of US$ 11 million&#13;
and equaled nine months of billing in the case of RENEL and six months in the case of APELE&#13;
ROMANE. This situation deteriorated in 1995 and the accounts payable to RENEL and APELE&#13;
ROMANE as of the end of the year were estimated to be in the vicinity of ROL 30 billion (US$ 12&#13;
million equivalent) representing 13 me nths of billings in the case of RENEL and three months of billings&#13;
in the case of APELE ROMANE. Like the reduction of accounts receivable, the reduction of accounts&#13;
payable is addressed tlirough the STAP included in the project [see para. 4.12].&#13;
4.5           RGAB Cost and Revenue Structure. Thus far, RGAB's current expenditures have been&#13;
limited tc those strictly necessary for keeping day-to-day operations going at minimal technical quality&#13;
standards and limiting maintenance to indispensable emergency interventions. In 1994 and 1995, about&#13;
80% of costs were incurred for three primary production inputs: power consumption (35%), raw water&#13;
abstraction fees (8%), and payroll (39%), while expenses for administrative and other operational and&#13;
maintenance expenditures accounted for the remaining 18%. The comparatively high proportion of&#13;
expenditures for primary production inputs is the combined result of various factors including the&#13;
predominant use of low energy efficiency equipment, especially for pumping, the importance of physical&#13;
and commercial water losses, and, owing to the disproportionally high needs for repair work, a relatively&#13;
numerous staff (though the impact of the latter is, to some extent, still offset by a low salary level).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
C. Tariff Schedule and Level&#13;
4.6           Tariffs for water supply and sewerage are set by the Bucharest municipality at the request&#13;
of RGAB and upon prior clearance by MOF [see para. 1.5]. Tariffs are set on the basis of RGAB's&#13;
recurrent costs at the time of the submission of the tariff proposal plus a 10% mark-up or "profit". As&#13;
applied, the tariff setting system is far from adequate as it (a) is based on past rather than projected costs;&#13;
'b) does not include any provision for uncollectible bills; (c) is affected by inappropriate accounting for&#13;
depreciation of fixed assets [see para. 4.2]; and, above all, (d) refers to a normative m' consumption and&#13;
not actual metered consumption [see para. 1.16 and para. 4.71.&#13;
4.7           Owing to the 'condominium' management procedures for large housing developments in&#13;
force under the previous regime, the installation of building-specific meters, let alone individual&#13;
household meters, was thought to be superfluous. Even when existing, meters are frequently broken&#13;
down. As a result, most customers are billed by water supply and sewerage utilities on a flat-rate basis&#13;
for a ncrmative daily per capita consumption of 170 liters for cold water (and separately by hot water&#13;
and district heating utilities for a consumption of 110 liters of hot water). Sewerage services are covered&#13;
through a sewerage surcharge. Tariff discrimination was eliminated in 1992 and, at present, all RGAB&#13;
customers pay the same price per m3 for supply of treated drinking water and for sewerage services,&#13;
(whereas previously a different tariff existed for industrial customers). In addition, RGAB also provides,&#13;
through separate networks, small amounts of untreated water for industrial use (about 6% of water sales)&#13;
at a lower tariff. Until March 1995, RGAB was also co-responsible for the delivery of hot water to&#13;
residenLial customers through an arrangement under which RGAB billed customers for the quantity of&#13;
water used whereas RADET charged them for the energy required to heat it. This arrangement has been&#13;
discontinued and at present RGAB only sells bulk water to RADET leaving it to the latter to recover its&#13;
costs from customers through separate billing.&#13;
4.8           Tariff increases have been made periodically since 1992 and, globally, the evolution of&#13;
the price of water and sewerage services has been above that of inflation and, thus has resulted in a steady&#13;
increase in the base tariff. Tariff adjustments, however, have usually been made at erratic intervals&#13;
causing wide fluctuations in real tariff levels, which, in US$ equivalents, have experienced declines of&#13;
30% to 50 % between successive adjustments. In view of the cash shortfalls suffered by RGAB in recent&#13;
years and confronted with the threat of major system breakdowns, as well as in response to discussions&#13;
held by the Bank with authorities of the central government and the Bucharest municipality in connection&#13;
with the preparation of the proposed project, RGAB tariffs were adjusted twice in 1995: first, in March,&#13;
from ROL 189 per m3 to ROL 250 per m3 for water supply, and from ROL 21 to ROL 29 for the&#13;
sewerage surcharge; and again in August, to ROL 355 per m3 (US$ 0.12 at end of June 1996 exchange&#13;
rates) for water supply and ROL 41 (US$ 0.02) for the sewerage surcharge. This resulted in an increase&#13;
of about 80% in nominal terms, while inflation for 1995 was 31 %. Because no increase in the cost of&#13;
RGAB's primary production inputs has occurred since August 1995, no further tariff adjustment has been&#13;
required until now [see para. 4.5]. It has been agreed and confirmed during negotiations. however, that.&#13;
in accordance with the provisions of the STAP. tariff adiustments will be carried out as soon as rises in&#13;
the cost of the above mentioned production inputs will cause RGAB's operating costs to increase by more&#13;
than 10% [see para. 4.12. para. 4.13. and para. 6.1(g)l.&#13;
4.9           Because of the 'condominium' management practices mentioned above, the distribution&#13;
networks in housing developments built since the 60's as well as within buildings were designed in a way&#13;
that makes apartment specific metering virtually unfeasible. Today household water bills only reflect&#13;
therefore the average household consumption of an entire building and, thus, provide no incentive to&#13;
individual households to strive for water conservation. As part of the Public Awareness and Water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
Wastage Reduction Program included in the proposed project RGAB will be exploring possible solutions&#13;
(both technical and commercial) that would allow to create financial incentives for water conservation at&#13;
the level of individual households. It will also carry out a tariff study and identify possible solutions that&#13;
would ensure that the services remain affordable to poorer households [see para. 4.13 and Annex 5.7(b)1.&#13;
D. RGAB's Future Financial Performance&#13;
4.10          In the institutional context of Romania, the case of RGAB cannot be dissociated from that&#13;
of other municipal RAs, and it seems unrealistic to try to change its operating regime (unless within the&#13;
context of a broader reform for all local RAs). Thus, it must be presumed that (a) authority over tariffs&#13;
will remain with the Bucharest municipality, with MOF continuing to exercise an indirect yet powerful&#13;
control, and (b) a substantial portion of water sector investments and, in particular, the completion of the&#13;
projects of the Glina waste water and the Crivina-Ogrezeni water treatment plants will continue to be&#13;
financed on a grant basis from the central government budget. This notwithstanding, the Government,&#13;
the Bucharest municipality, and RGAB have agreed that it is possible and desirable to introduce, under&#13;
the proposed project, significant changes in RGAB's current financial management practices. The main&#13;
effect of these changes would be that RGAB would (a) assume the full responsibility for contracting and&#13;
servicing the Bank, loan, (b) increase its internal cash generation in order to participate in the financing&#13;
of the project investments, and (c) take into account the resulting financial costs in its budgetary planning.&#13;
4.11          Financial projections for the 1996-2002 period [see Annex 21 using the tariff levels&#13;
contemplated under the proposed project show that RGAB would have some negative net income (after&#13;
depreciation), mainly as a result of: (a) more realistic estimates of losses on accounts receivable (the&#13;
equivalent of about 17% of the amount billed in 1996 to reflect accumulated losses, and about 4% to 5%&#13;
annually after 1996), (b) more adequate depreciation charges (2.5% on revalued fixed assets); and (c)&#13;
increased allocations (in real terms) to operation and maintenance expenditures. The projections are&#13;
conservative and assume a lag of two months in tariff increases to cover increases in operating costs. It&#13;
also assumes a gradual improvement in parameters such as bill collection, resulting from the actions taken&#13;
under the STAP. RGAB's internal cash generation will increase gradually from ROL 14 billion (US$&#13;
4 million) in 1996 to ROL 27 billion (US$ 6 million) in the year 2000. RGAB will be able to maintain&#13;
a debt service coverage ratio greater than 1.3 through the life of the project and will be able to generate&#13;
(after taking care of working capital and debt service requirements) close to ROL 50 billion (US$ 12&#13;
million) for contribution to the project and for other network rehabilitation programs.&#13;
4.12          Short-Term  Action Program  (STAP).  RGAB, in consultation with the Bucharest&#13;
Municipality and MOF, prepared by end of 1995 a Financial Improvement Plan (FIP) using the&#13;
methodology developed for the FESAL. The FIP identified those key actions that affect the cash&#13;
generation of RGAB and the viability of the project and allowed to group them in a coherent thee-year&#13;
Short-Term Action Program (STAP) [see Annex 61. The STAP includes the measures required to achieve&#13;
the targets indicated above and, specifically, the steps to be taken to (a) reduce payables, (b) improve bill&#13;
collection rates, and (c) prevent the recurrence of arrears build-up. The plan, whose outline was&#13;
approved by the RGAB Administration Board on December 28, 1995, contains a detailed implementation&#13;
schedule of the above measures and defines a series of criteria and performance targets that will allow&#13;
a close surveillance of RGAB's future financial perfornance.&#13;
4.13          The most critical actions included in the STAP that will be closely monitored during&#13;
project implementation are the following [see Annex 61:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
(a)    Tariff adiustment: adoption of the principle of a tariff adjustment to compensate&#13;
for increases in the cost of RGAB's main production inputs within a period of&#13;
thirty days after RGAB's operating costs 6 have increased by 10% over previous&#13;
levels with a view to obtain coverage of RGAB's full costs 7 and maintain real&#13;
tariffs at the August 1995 level [see para. 4.8];&#13;
(b)    Receivables and payables: measures to improve bill collection as percentage of&#13;
the total potential collections (current year bills + accounts receivable at the&#13;
beginning of the year) from 69% (1995 peformance) to levels consistent with the&#13;
financial program supporting the project. Technical assistance to improve the&#13;
management of its customers accounts is currently provided to RGAB under a&#13;
French bilateral program and will be continued under the project. The bill&#13;
collection targets I included in the financial projections are: 70% in 1996; 72%&#13;
in 1997; and 75 % in 1998 and beyond. To make the bill collection performance&#13;
feasible, the STAP includes measures to: (i) establish compensation agreements&#13;
between RGAB, suppliers and customers for settlement of arrears; (ii) reschedule&#13;
and write-off of arrears of more than one year; (iii) swap RADET debt with&#13;
RENEL and other public sector enterprises at a discount to be negotiated between&#13;
RGAB and other public sector enterprises; and (iv) make amendments in&#13;
contracts with RADET and other customers to enable RGAB to enforce payment&#13;
according to metered consumption;&#13;
(c)    Operating costs: implementation of measures to (i) increase staff productivity;&#13;
(ii) reduce wastage of production inputs; and (iii) renegotiate financial conditions&#13;
of raw water purchases from APELE ROMANE;&#13;
(d)    Payroll: reduction of number of employees (all categories) by about 12% over&#13;
the 1996 - 1999 period through attrition, encouragement of voluntary departures,&#13;
and divestment of non-essential activities.&#13;
During negotiations. agreement was obtained on the content and implementation timetable&#13;
of the Short-Term Action Program (STAP) [see para. 6. 1(g)1. Approval of the STAP by the Romanian&#13;
authorities is a condition for loan effectiveness Isee para. 6.2(b)1.&#13;
4.14           Progress in the implementation of the STAP will be monitored closely on the basis of&#13;
indicators agreed upon with RGAB (working ratio, bill collection ratio) and results will be reviewed and&#13;
discussed annually with the Bank (see Annex 6). Discussions would take place before September 30 each&#13;
year starting in 1996 and the review would include: (a) assessment of progress achieved; (b) possibly&#13;
required target adjustments, antd (c) adequacy of budget proposal for following year. If any of these&#13;
reviews would show results unsatisfactory to the Bank, RGAB would submit an acceptable alternative&#13;
adjustment proposal no later than November 30 of the same year [see para. 4.121. During negotiations,&#13;
6  Operating costs defined as: Expenditure for salaries and wages + energy + raw water + materials + maintenance&#13;
7 Full costs include operating costs + non-operating costs + depreciation + taxes + provision for bad debts&#13;
8  Bill collection ratio defined as amount of collections against current year bills + accounts receivable at the beginning of&#13;
the year divided by amount of current year bills + accounts receivable at the beginning of the year&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
the conditions, timing and performance evaluation criteria for the annual review of STAP results were&#13;
reviewed and agreed [see para. 6. 1(g)l.&#13;
4.15          Financial Risks. An acknowledged risk is that RGAB could be unable to fund its&#13;
financial contribution to the project or service the Bank loan. A change in the volume of water billed&#13;
is likely to be a lesser risk given that the financial projections are based on a moderate increase in billings&#13;
(from 340 million m3 estimated in 1995 to 367 million m3 estimated for 2002, or a less than a 10%&#13;
cumulative increase over seven years). Tariff and bill collection levels below the ones established in the&#13;
base case [see para. 4.12] would significantly affect RGAB's financial performance and reduce its&#13;
capacity to generate sufficient internal cash resources for financing its share of the project or other&#13;
investments for maintenance and overhaul of infrastructure and/or equipment. The combination of&#13;
reduced tariffs and reduced collection ratio would result in a debt service coverage less than 1.0 in 1999&#13;
and beyond. The agreement of MOF, the Bucharest municipality and RGAB to maintain tariffs at August&#13;
1995 level in real terms and the various actions included in the STAP to improve collection are key for&#13;
sustaining the financial viability of the project. Agreement was obtained at negotiations that RGAB will&#13;
consult with the Bank before incurring additional debt if RGAB's debt coverage ratio falls or is proiected&#13;
to fall below 1.3 for any year throughout the loan repavment period [see para. 6. 1(h).&#13;
4.16           A financial sensitivity analysis shows that the lowest tariff level that would allow RGAB&#13;
to generate enough cash to make its contribution to the proposed project without reducing the quality level&#13;
of operation and maintenance below acceptable levels or running up payment arrears to its suppliers is&#13;
5% below the base case level (assuming bill collection stays at the base case level). The lowest&#13;
acceptable bill collection index would be about 68% (with tariffs staying at the base case level) [see&#13;
details in Annex 21. The actions included in the STAP [see para 4.12.] should reduce the risk that&#13;
RGAB's performance falls below the base case level, and [as noted in para. 4.14] the Bank will monitor&#13;
progress closely.&#13;
4.17          Clarification of Institutional Framework.  An important obstacle to a sustainable&#13;
improvement in RGAB's technical, financial and commercial management performance is the lack of a&#13;
precisely defined framework for its legal and financial relationships with the Bucharest municipality,&#13;
under whose supervision it now operates. While a certain number of the prevailing ambiguities stem&#13;
from the absence of an appropriate national legal framework and can only be resolved by legal action&#13;
taken at that level (e.g. the issue of legal ownership of RGAB assets), other issues fall in the competence&#13;
of the Bucharest municipality. The latter include (a) the scope and extent of regulatory functions&#13;
performed by the municipal authorities (i.e. the mayor and/or the municipal council), in regard to tariff&#13;
setting, and fixing conditions and standards of service provision, (b) the autonomy granted to RGAB to&#13;
make decisions in investment and operational management matters, (c) the nature of the financial&#13;
obligations assumed by either the Bucharest municipality or RGAB and the delimitation of the&#13;
corresponding accountabilities. As spelled out in a policy statement presented to the Bank during&#13;
negotiations, the Bucharest municipality and RGAB have agreed to revise the existing legal framework&#13;
and service provision directives that currently govern RGAB's operations. The revised service provision&#13;
directives would precisely delimit the respective obligations, rights and responsibilities of the Bucharest&#13;
municipality and RGAB in matters of operational and financial management, and would define criteria&#13;
to be used for assessing the future performance of the company.&#13;
4.18          Medium-term  investment and financing program:  The expected improvement in&#13;
RGAB's financial position will not be sufficient to generate the resources needed for a broader&#13;
rehabilitation and modernization of the water supply and sewerage system in Bucharest. To complete on-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
going projects with central government financing in a reasonable time would require public sector&#13;
resources in an amount that, given the macroeconomic constraints, is unlikely to be available in the near&#13;
future. A comprehensive review of the investment and operation and maintenance strategy for the water&#13;
supply and sewerage sector in Bucharest is therefore warranted. A comprehensive medium- and long-&#13;
term development program will be prepared by RGAB, in accordance with terms of reference to be&#13;
agreed with the Bank, in connection with the project implementation progress review [see para. 3.15].&#13;
The program will (a) define the measures to be taken to address the most critical problems (including&#13;
further rationalization of expenditures, revision of tariff structures and policies, and review of investment&#13;
policies and strategies), and (b) prepare an operational development and investment plan with&#13;
corresponding sources of financing [see para. 3.15].  The program  will be prepared with the&#13;
understanding that its satisfactory completion will allow the preparation of possible follow up projects to&#13;
be funded with Bank assistance.&#13;
4.19         Accounting and Auditing. According to the interim audit report for 1995 which was&#13;
prepared by independent external auditors, RGAB's accounting practices are comply with the instructions&#13;
of the Romanian National Accounting Plan adopted in 1994. RGAB has agreed to implement a specific&#13;
action plan to that effect. There are several areas such as inventory management, fixed asset accounting,&#13;
accounting of receivables, payables and cash where the auditors have recommended improved accounting&#13;
practices and controls to bring RGAB's accounts closer to internationally acceptable accounting standards.&#13;
It should be noted that differences between Romanian accounting practices and International Accounting&#13;
Standards (IAS) cannot be resolved through this project. However, the auditors' recommendations for&#13;
improving internal accounting practices in RGAB will be implemented in such a way that RGAB's&#13;
financial statements will be presented as closely as possible to internationally accepted accounting&#13;
standards and an accounting manual setting down RGAB's accounting policies and practices will be&#13;
prepared. The external audit will cover RGAB's financial statements, the Special Account, Statements&#13;
of Expenditure and compliance with loan covenants of a financial nature. The audit report will be&#13;
submitted to the Bank within six months of the close of each fiscal year. Agreement on the arrangements&#13;
for the annual auditing of RGAB's financial statements was obtained during negotiations [see para.&#13;
6.1(i)l.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
V. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
5.1           The project will support the rehabilitation of infrastructure in a sector that faces a&#13;
significant backlog of unmet needs and where the potential for improvements in efficiency is very high.&#13;
This was identified as a priority in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) that was discussed at the Board&#13;
on March 14, 1994 in conjunction with the Petroleum Rehabilitation Project (Loan 3723-RO). The&#13;
project's position was further confirmed in the November 1995 CPPR discussions with the Romania&#13;
Government.&#13;
5.2           The project will complement the Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan&#13;
(FESAL) by seeking to improve the issue of financial discipline in RGAB. Through the implementation&#13;
of a program of financial and operational measures that are necessary to ensure the sustainability of the&#13;
proposed investment program, the project will lay the giound for the future expansion of the rehabilitation&#13;
of the water supply and sewerage system in Bucharest which could be supported by a series of follow-up&#13;
projects. The policy measures which are included in the STAP and which were agreed and confirmed&#13;
at negotiations will lead to improved financial viability of RGAB and the sustainability of its operations&#13;
in the medium- and longer term. They are also expected to create the basis for a possible future private&#13;
sector involvement in the delivery of water supply services.  The project also will support the&#13;
Government's policy of decentralizing the responsibility for the provision of local services to local&#13;
authorities. By introducing the concepts of cost-recovery and consumer contribution to the financing of&#13;
sector investments it would have a beneficial development impact.&#13;
5.3           The project will bring significant policy changes to the management of the water sector&#13;
in Bucharest. First, it will support RGAB's efforts to shift from a system of billing for a notional water&#13;
consumption to one based on actual consumption. Second, it will introduce the concept of cost recovery&#13;
into RGAB's investment planning, and concurrently, initiate a financial management reform that should&#13;
lead to a gradual decrease in RGAB's dependence on central government funding for future infrastructure&#13;
investment.&#13;
5.4          It must not be overlooked, however, that the project will represent only a first and modest&#13;
step in a long-term effort to rehabilitate the entire Bucharest water supply system and upgrade it into a&#13;
financially sustainable operation. Given the limited scope of the project in comparison to the needs for&#13;
a full rehabilitation of the entire water supply and sewerage system, the direct and immediate effects on&#13;
problems such as water losses should not be overestimated. Indeed, the project's objective is not to solve&#13;
all of RGAB's problems at once, but to launch a rehabilitation process that could be progressively&#13;
expanded as the operational and financial performance of RGAB will improve. Of special importance&#13;
in this respect will be RGAB's efforts - supported by the project -to raise community awareness of the&#13;
need for water conservation through public education and information programs and the creation of&#13;
corresponding financial incentives.&#13;
5.5           Rehabilitation and repair of existing infrastructure and facilities are the least-cost and only&#13;
practical alternative for the improvement of water supply conditions in Bucharest. Further deferment of&#13;
the critically needed investments funded under the project is expected to result in an annual increase of&#13;
water losses at an annual rate of about 10% in the neighborhoods whose networks will be rehabilitated&#13;
under the project and a corresponding rise in water distribution costs. Postponement of the proposed&#13;
rehabilitation and repair works would lead to a rapid reduction of water availability and quality with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
important negative economic and social effects and, although not quantifiable with the data available,&#13;
rising health risks [see para. 1.14], or request likely emergency repair works whose cost would be&#13;
significantly above those of the proposed project. Attempting to maintain current levels of water&#13;
availability, in a context of high, and increasing losses, by constructing new additional production&#13;
capacity without previously addressing the issue of water loss causes would represent the economically&#13;
least efficient alternative.&#13;
5.6           The principal quantifiable benefits that will accrue to RGAB from the project will be a&#13;
decrease in RGAB's operating costs as a result of increased production efficiency (i.e. reduced energy&#13;
consumption) and reduction of water losses (which will lead to a reduction of the total volume of water&#13;
to be produced). In the medium- and longer-term, the implementation of the Short-Term Action Program&#13;
(STAP) will bring about important improvements in RGAB's operational, financial and commercial&#13;
management performance. The combined effects of the above will-bring about a reduction in the total&#13;
cost of water supply and thereby allow RGAB to significantly expand its financial contribution to future&#13;
sector investments, including in environmentally important but thus far ill-attended areas such as waste&#13;
water treatment.&#13;
5.7           Specific benefits of the project will include:&#13;
(a)    increase in the hours of availability of adequate water supply service in various areas of&#13;
the city gradually passing from the current average of twelve hours per day to&#13;
approximately seventeen hours per day as a result of improved flow management in the&#13;
primary distribution network and higher water pressure;&#13;
(b)    improvements in water quality through the upgrading of water treatment plants and, in&#13;
particular, filtering and chlorination equipment, as well as through repairs of the&#13;
distribution network. These repairs will also contribute to prevent contamination of&#13;
drinking water by groundwater and, therefore, would help reduce the incidence of water-&#13;
borne diseases;&#13;
(c!    gradual reduction of unaccounted-for-water, currently estimated at over 60 %, due to both&#13;
the elimination of physical losses in the distribution network, and the improvement of&#13;
RGAB's commercial management as well as the extension of metering and the&#13;
development of water conservation programs;&#13;
(d)    improvement in RGAB's maintenance, control, and operational functions through the&#13;
provision of spare parts, meters, operational equipment and training;&#13;
(e)    reduction in RGAB's operating costs as a result of decreasing energy consumption&#13;
through the provision of new, and rehabilitation of existing pumping equipment as well&#13;
gradual reduction in unaccounted-for-water.&#13;
5.8           An internal rate of return (IRR) has been calculated for the components of the project that&#13;
will have a measurable effect on RGAB's cost of water production and distribution (76% of total base&#13;
cost) [see Annex 31. No rate of return has been calculated for the components addressing the issues of&#13;
water quality (15% of total base cost) and strengthening of RGAB's management (9% of total base cost)&#13;
because their benefits are largely unquantifiable, thougii clearly very significant. The project is predicated&#13;
on the assumption that on average the aggregate demand being met (albeit with the deficiencies noted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
above) and that no additional water will be made available to consumers. Rather, as a result of more&#13;
balanced distribution and increase in service reliability the project is expected to bring about a decrease&#13;
of household consumption owing to the elimination of the need for 'coping strategies' [see para. 1.13].&#13;
However, these latter benefits cannot be evaluated ex-ante and, therefore, have not been taken into&#13;
account. Future evolution of water production and consumption will be closely monitored under the&#13;
project [see monitoring indicators in Annex 5.51 and terms of reference for operational technical&#13;
assistance in Annex 5.7(c)l in order to provide, among other things, a data base for the evaluation of&#13;
future projects.&#13;
5.9           The IRR calculations are based on very conservative estimates for the projected operating&#13;
cost savings that would derive from (a) the decrease in water losses, (b) the reduction of energy&#13;
consumption, and (c) the reduction of maintenance and repair costs in comparison to the situation that&#13;
could be expected to result without the project. Separate calculations were made for the four sub-&#13;
components: (1) 'Primary Network Repair', (2) 'Secondary Network Repair', (3) 'Pumping Station&#13;
Rehabilitation', and (4) 'Metering'. The combined IRR calculated for the target implementation scenario&#13;
(see para. 3.3) which assumes a three-year project implementation according to schedule, no cost overrun,&#13;
and water and energy savings as expected, is 19% (weighted average of the IRR for the above four sub-&#13;
components: 22%, 12%, 15%, and 48%, respectively).&#13;
5.10          In view of RGAB's lack of experience with the implementation of projects of this nature,&#13;
it seems reasonable, however, to set the expected IRR at a lower level which reflects possible slippage.&#13;
To assess the impact of various possible negative developments sensitivity analyses were carried out&#13;
comparing the above case to four less favorable alternative scenarios: (a) assuming a 50% lower than&#13;
anticipated customer response to the extension of metering and water conservation incentives and loss&#13;
reduction benefits therefore primarily derived from reduced physical losses, the IRR would drop from&#13;
19% to 15%; (b) assuming that, because of higher than expected costs of the secondary distribution&#13;
network rehabilitation, only 75% of the initial project area could be covered and water losses reduced&#13;
accordingly, the IRR would decrease from 19% to 18%; the effects of (c) a possible one year delay in&#13;
project start up and (d) a longer than anticipated implementation period of five (instead of three) years&#13;
were also analyzed but turned out to be marginal, primarily because the type of works included in the&#13;
project generates a stream of discrete benefits and costs that occur in tandem and are proportional.&#13;
5.11          Taking the various analyses into account, the base case against which actual results will&#13;
be monitored assumes a cost overrun of 20% on all four components mentioned in para. 5.9 above, and&#13;
a corresponding reduction of 20% of all project benefits. The resulting IRR is 12%.&#13;
B. Project Risks&#13;
5.12          In addition to the political risks typical for any project dealing with local authorities and&#13;
local utilities, the project faces two main categories of risks: financial and technical. The financial risks&#13;
are twofold. First, given the high proportion of local counterpart funding required for the project there&#13;
is a risk that the project's implementation performance could be adversely affected by the lack or&#13;
insufficiency of counterpart funding due to (a) unforeseen macro-economic constraints and a resulting&#13;
downturn of the economy or (b) financial difficulties at the level of the Bucharest municipality. However,&#13;
this risk is country- and not project-specific, however, and would affect the Bank's project portfolio as&#13;
a whole. Because of its very nature it cannot be assessed on an ex-ante basis and can only be dealt with&#13;
on a case by case basis including a project restructuring should the need for it arise. Additionally, it must&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
be taken into account that the funding requirements are relatively small. The annual contribution of US$&#13;
5.0 million from the central government budget represents only about 2% of the 1995 total annual&#13;
investment transfers to local governments, while the annual contribution of US$ 2.5 million from the&#13;
Bucharest municipality amnounts to about 4% of its 1995 investment budget.&#13;
5.13          Second, a financial risk could arise from RGAB's weak financial position and are&#13;
described above (see para 4.15). RGAB's financial viability depends, to a large extent, on a timely&#13;
collection of bills. To date, collection rates remain unsatisfactory, primarily, due to the poor payment&#13;
behavior of large industrial and institutional customers. A persistence of lack of financial discipline at&#13;
the level of public sector enterprises, a problem which is addressed under the FESAL, could jeopardize&#13;
the financial recovery of RGAB. The seriousness of these risks is mitigated by (a) the implementation&#13;
of the measures adopted under the FESAL; (b) the Governmnent and the Bucharest municipality's&#13;
commitment to implement and enforce the measures included in the STAP; and (c) the continuation,&#13;
under the project, , of the restructuring program for RGAB's customer account management system&#13;
which was initiated in early 1996 with French bilateral technical assistance and can be expected to&#13;
significantly strengthen the company's financial and commercial management 'muscle'.&#13;
5.14          The technical risks of the project are inherent to the implementation of any first-time&#13;
project by a new beneficiary who lacks the necessary familiarity with the World Bank procedures&#13;
associated with this type of activity. These risks are compounded by (a) the novelty of the type of&#13;
operations funded by the project in Romania, the ensuing lack of reference price framework and,&#13;
therefore, some uncertainty about costs, and (b) the complexity of the approval procedures required by&#13;
the Romania Government for all investments funded totally or partially with government resources and&#13;
which could lead to substantial delays in the start-up of the project. The possible effects of (a) a delay&#13;
of up to one year in the project and a longer than anticipated implementation period of five years instead&#13;
of three and (b) a significant cost overrun have been assessed in the sensitivity analyses presented above,&#13;
[see para. 5.101. The risks are mitigated by (i) the pruvision (under already ongoing technical assistance&#13;
programs) of extensive technical support and training to RGAB prior to loan effectiveness and during the&#13;
start-up phase of project implementation [see para. 3.1]; (ii) the early completion of all bidding documents&#13;
and the completion by the Romanian authorities of the prequalification documents which was set as a&#13;
condition for negotiation, and the completion of the bidding packages for at least four ICB procured&#13;
contracts which was set as a condition for Board presentation; and (iii) the provision of necessary&#13;
technical assistance for project supervision under the project and a thorough monitoring of implementation&#13;
by the Bank [see para. 3.1 and para. 3.15].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
6.1          During negotiations, agreements were reached on the following:&#13;
(a)    On-lending arrangements [see para. 2.10];&#13;
(b)    RGAB internal management procedures for project-related environmental issues&#13;

(h)    Prior consultation by RGAB with the Bank before incurring additional debt in the&#13;
event that such debt would lower the debt-service coverage ratio below 1.3, (see&#13;
para. 4.15]; and&#13;
(i)    Annual Auditing of RGAB's financial statements [para. 4.19];&#13;
6.2          The following are conditions of Loan Effectiveness:&#13;
(a)    Signing of On-lending and Guarantee Agreement [see para. 2.10]; and&#13;
(b)    Approval of the STAP by the Romanian authorities [see para. 4.12].&#13;
6.3          With the above assurances and conditions, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of&#13;
US Dollar 25 million to Romania, repayable in twenty years, including five years of grace, at the&#13;
standard variable interest rate for LIBOR-based US Dollar Single Currency loans.&#13;

ROMANIA&#13;
Bucharest Water Supply Project&#13;
Environmental Review&#13;
1.            Environmental Screening&#13;
1.1           The Bucharest Water Supply Project is assigned in Category B for the purposes of&#13;
environmental screening, required for World Bank lending operations. Following the guidelines of&#13;
Operational Directive (OD) 4.01 of the Bank, a review of the environmental problems associated with&#13;
water supply operations in Bucharest has been carried out by a team of RGAB and Bank environmental&#13;
experts to (a) determine the potential negative environmental impacts of the project and identify&#13;
appropriaEe mitigaEion measures (if needed); (b) identify opportunities for environmental enhancement;&#13;
and (c) assess environmental monitoring and management capacity. The environmental review confirmed&#13;
that the project will have no major negative environmental impact, and that minor negative environmental&#13;
effects that ma) result from construction activities will be adequately monitored and mitigated by RGAB&#13;
in collaboration with the contractors concerned.&#13;
1.2           The review also confirmed that the environmental permit for the Bucharest Water Supply&#13;
Project. obtained by RGAB, complied with the Romnanian legal requirements of the current Romanian&#13;
environmental impact assessment regulation, and, more specifically, the regulations for environmental&#13;
permits for invesrment projects, issued by the Ministry of Water, Forests and Environment (MOWFEN) -&#13;
that is. Ordinances nos. 170/90; 113/90, and 619/92. The current Romanian environmental impact&#13;
assessment regulation will be revised in line with the new Law on Environment promulgated beginning&#13;
of January, 1996. Due to the verv limited environmental impacts of the project, however, no additional&#13;
environmnental impact assessment will be necessary.&#13;
2.            Project objectives and expected environmental benefits&#13;
2.1           The Bucharest Water Supply Project is a first step in the World Bank assistance to&#13;
Romania's water supply and sanitation sector. As such it is designed as a relatively simple operation,&#13;
financing rehabilitation/replacement of critical equipment and parts of the water supply network, and&#13;
assisting RGAB  in achieving financial and instirutional improvements.  Concrete environmental&#13;
enhancement opportunities identified through the project are linked to the rehabilitation of the drinking&#13;
water treatment plants (water filtering and treatrnent, and sludge management). In both the Arcuda and&#13;
the Ro,u plants, the project would improve filtering, filter washing and chlorination. In the Rosu plant,&#13;
the project would also finance repairs of the sludge removal system and improvements in aluminum&#13;
sulphate dosing, and silicate and sulfuric acid stocking (see Annex 5. 1). In addition, the project will&#13;
promote better environmental management through the assignment of environmental advisory task to an&#13;
appropriate senior company staff, who will report directly to the General Manager.&#13;
2.2           More specifically, the proposed project is expected to bring environmental and health&#13;
benefits in the following areas:&#13;
(i)    rehabilitation and improved operation and maintenance of the rwo (Arcade and&#13;
Race) drinking water treatment plants will assure better drinking water quality,&#13;
as well as better handling of water treatment residuals;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
(page 2 of 3)&#13;
(ii)   rehabilitation of parts of the water supply network, complemented with a&#13;
metering program, and public awareness campaign will reduce water losses and&#13;
encourage water conservation;&#13;
(iii)   pumping station rehabilitation will increase the energy efficiency of RGAB's&#13;
operations; and&#13;
(iv)   improvements in the operational management will also contribute to a better day-&#13;
to-day environmental management (treatment plants waste management;&#13;
handling of chemicals and toxic substances; improvements in the operation and&#13;
maintenance of the sewerage network, including improved emergency response;&#13;
more efficient use of information from the existing water quality monitoring&#13;
networks; better compliance with environmental regulations).&#13;
3.            Environmental pmoblems associated with water supply operations in Bucharest&#13;
3.1           RC-AB is facing a number of problems related to quality of raw, drinking and waste&#13;
water.  Raw  water quality is influenced by irregularities in upstream  water use and treatment.&#13;
Reportedly, water in the Arges and Dimbovita rivers is often polluted above category I permissible levels&#13;
in the vicinity of Bucharest. During the summer period the level of coliform is said to exceed up to 6-7&#13;
times the standard levels. In the Arges river, explosive development of phyto-plankton biomass causes&#13;
raw water quality problems from February-March onward. The low quality of raw water results in (i)&#13;
higher costs of operations and maintenance of drinking water treatment plants; (ii) a need for excessive&#13;
use of chemicals (chlorine and aluminum sulphate in particular) in the treatment process; and (iii) a&#13;
comparatively poor quality of the drinking water supplied by RGAB. Although the level of pollution&#13;
resulting from industrial activities has decreased significantly in the past few years due to the economic&#13;
downturn, lax enforcement of environmental regulations and financial constraints have contributed to&#13;
maintaining industrial water pollution at a level above acceptable standards. The project would contribute&#13;
to a significant improvement in the quality of drinking water, but will not be able to address the problems&#13;
of upstream pollution, an issue that is not in its area of competence.&#13;
3.2           Current water quality standards are defined by two key regulations: STAS 4706-88 of&#13;
November 1, 1988 for surface water categories and conditions, and STAS 1342-91 of June 1, 1992 for&#13;
standards for drinking water quality. In addition, Decrees nos. 414/79 and 14/83 specify the admissible&#13;
pollution limits and technical rules for discharge of waste water into open water bodies and for discharges&#13;
into public sewer systems. A permitting and contracting system is in place, requiring a permit for waste&#13;
water discharge, specifying the permissible substances and emission levels, and a contract with the&#13;
authority in charge of the receiving body (open water body or a municipal sewer). A new water law is&#13;
under consideration in the Parliament and will provide the basis for revisions and updating of the existing&#13;
water quality regulations. The new law will also introduce a compliance schedule for water companies&#13;
and other point source polluters.&#13;
4.            Monitoring capacity&#13;
4.1           Monitoring of water quality, a responsibility of the water department in MOFWEN is well&#13;
developed. There are, countrywide, 3,070 water quality monitoring stations (divided among 11 river&#13;
basins). In addition, RGAB has its own well-established system (a central laboratory with a number&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
(page 3 of 3)&#13;
of check points, drinking water plant laboratories, pumping station check points, waste water laboratory&#13;
and check points) for monitoring the quality of raw water, drinking water and waste water. The RGAB's&#13;
laboratory provides physical, chemical, biological, and bacteriological analysis of both raw and drinking&#13;
water. Moreover, drinking water quality is also monitored and controlled by the Center for Preventive&#13;
Medicine of the Ministry of Health (MOH). While RGAB envisages further developing its capacity to&#13;
monitor and control water quality, the review concluded that for the purpose of the project the existing&#13;
capacity and perforrnance can be considered adequate. As an immediate first step towards improving its&#13;
capacity to manage environmental issues, RGAB will establish the position of an environmental advisor&#13;
to the general director with a view to improve coordination of environmental monitoring and compliance,&#13;
(see para. 6.1 below).&#13;
5.            Sewer system and waste water treatment.&#13;
5.1           Bucharest has a relatively well developed sewer system, which serves approximately 85 %&#13;
of the population as well as a significant share of the industries located in the city. Currently there is no&#13;
municipal waste water treatment facility. The waste water is discharged directly in Dimbovila river near&#13;
Glina. Downstream from Bucharest both Dimbovila and Arges rivers are heavily polluted, with a&#13;
negative impact on agricultural production and on the ecology of the Danube, and the Danube delta. A&#13;
waste water treatment plant, designed in the late 70s/early 80s, has been under construction since 1985.&#13;
The plant has two lines at different stage of completion. Line 1 is almost completed -- the primary&#13;
treatment is ready for a trial start, the secondary treatment is 85-90% completed, and the sludge treatment&#13;
is about 80% completed. Line 2 is only 35-40% completed (so far only basic infrastructure construction&#13;
is finished). Since the time the treatment plant was designed, significant changes have occurred in the&#13;
financial position of the central government budget (which funds the construction), as well as in the&#13;
environmental regulations conditions. Additional changes are expected. For example, in the original&#13;
design, reference is made only to BODS (12 or less mg/I) and suspended solids (20 or less mg/I), and&#13;
neither nitrogen nor phosphorus removal were considered. To comply with current requirements and&#13;
treatment needs, a study to determine the feasibility of updating the design of the plant is under&#13;
preparation.&#13;
6.            Recommendations&#13;
6.1           RGAB's performance in environmental monitoring should be strengthened by the creation&#13;
of a Environmental Advisory position. The environmental advisor should monitor environmental&#13;
compliance, fo!low up on changes in the environmental regulations which may affect RGAB and propose&#13;
appropriate actions, serve as a RGAB internal focal point on environmental issues and corresponding staff&#13;
training, and liaise with the relevant Romanian authorities and with other agencies on environmental&#13;
matters. The detailed terms of reference for this task have been discussed during the negotiations.&#13;
6.2           Generally, RGAB should develop a more proactive attitude toward issues that are of&#13;
concern for the company but are primarily under control of other entities such as MOWFEN, APELE&#13;
ROMANE, and others and relate to matters such as the implementation of regulations governing industrial&#13;
waste water discharge into the sewerage network (enforcement of pre-treatment standards; fines for non-&#13;
compliance, billing and collection procedures, etc.); negotiation of a compliance schedule for waste water&#13;
discharges by RGAB and harmonization across sectors of compliance requirements.&#13;

(h)          Financial Projections - Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
2.           The main assumptions on which the financial projections are based, are the following:&#13;
A.    Connections and Metering&#13;
(a)          the number of connections remains constant since no significant urban&#13;
growth is expected in the coming years; and&#13;
(b)          the number of metered connections is based on the program agreed at&#13;
appraisal.&#13;
B.    Tariffs. Sales and Bill Collection Index&#13;
(a)          the volume of water sold experiences modest increases as a result of&#13;
improvements in RGAB's commercial management, including the&#13;
expansion of metering;&#13;
(b)          the tariff level remains constant in real terms at the August 1995 level;&#13;
the tariff level will be adjusted within thirty days of an increase of 10%&#13;
in operating costs over previous levels and a coverage equal to full costs&#13;
(as defined in the Short-Term Action Program (STAP); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 2&#13;
4pm. 2 of 101&#13;
(c)          the expected evolution of the ratios of total bill collection (current year&#13;
bills + accounts receicvable at the beginning of the year) in relation to&#13;
amounts billed each year + accounts receivable is as follows:&#13;
1996:                      70%;&#13;
1997:                      72%;&#13;
1998 and beyond:           75%;&#13;
C.    Inetnnts&#13;
(a)           the RGAB investment program  is comprised of the Bank-financed&#13;
project, the completion of the Crivina-Ogrezeni Water Treatment Plant,&#13;
and complementary own-source financed rehabilitation projects, but does&#13;
not include the completion of the Glina waste water treatment plant; and&#13;
(b)          the investment plan is based central government and Bucharest&#13;
municipality contributions to the Bank-financed project; central&#13;
government financing of 100% of the investments for the Crivina-&#13;
Ogrezeni and Glina plants; and internal cash generation for&#13;
complementary rehabilitation projects.&#13;
D.    QDeraing Costs, and Depreciation&#13;
(a)          the operating costs increase with inflation. They also include a provision&#13;
fur the funding of a gradual improvement of operation and maintenance&#13;
activities as well for additional costs incurred by RGAB from the&#13;
operation of the Crivina-Ogrezeni Water Treatment plant as of 1999;&#13;
(b)          the losses on accounts receivable are estimated to be the equivalent of&#13;
7% of sales in 1996 in order to take into account the expected losses&#13;
from accumulated receivables, and to represent about 5% to 6% of sales&#13;
in 1997 and thereafter; and&#13;
(c)          the depreciation charges are estimated at 2.5% of revalued fixed assets.&#13;
E.    InmeTaxes&#13;
the income taxes are estimated on the basis of 'income before taxes plus&#13;
losses on receivables' to reflect the fact that RGAB currently is not&#13;
allowed to make any provision for losses on receivables. [According to&#13;
Romanian practices RAs cannot make provisions for losses on&#13;
receivables. Losses on receivables are accounted-for on a case by case&#13;
basis upon prior demonstration that the bill in question cannot be&#13;
collected].&#13;

Bucharest Water Supply Project&#13;
Economic Evaluation&#13;
1.               The principal quantifiable benefits that will accrue from  the project will consist in a&#13;
reduction of RGAB's operating cost as a result of a reduction in water losses ' and increased production&#13;
efficiency (in the form of reduced energy consumption for distribution). As noted in the SAR (see para.&#13;
1.13) RGAB currently produces about 80%  more water than it would need to do under normal operating&#13;
conditions (i.e. with a water loss rate similar to that of Western European utilities) or, in other words,&#13;
it could maintain the same level of service by reducing its daily production from about 1.7 million m'&#13;
to about 0.9 million ml.&#13;

2.               Without the rehabilitation strategy initiated under the project, losses in the network are&#13;
expected to continue to rise annually, on average, at a rate of 5%, based on surveys carried out by the&#13;
consultant and data provided by RGAB. (They are assumed to rise at, at least, 10% in the neighborhoods&#13;
selected for rehabilitation under the proposed project). Assuming conservatively that 'household' losses&#13;
would remain at their current level, this would result in total losses reaching a proportion of 75% of total&#13;
production in a period of about ten years. Given that the two treatment plants of Arcuda and Rosu are&#13;
already operating at, respectively, 20% and 40%, above their nominal capacity, a rapid decrease in&#13;
service levels will be unavoidable.&#13;
3.               A cost-benefit analysis was made for the four project components that address the problem&#13;
of loss reduction and operating efficiency and whose benefits can be identified and estimated separately:&#13;
(a)     repair of the primary network;&#13;
(b)     repair of the secondary network&#13;
(c)     rehabilitation of pumping stations;&#13;
(d)     program  of meter installation.&#13;
1       Water losses include (a) losses in the network (25 X of total production) due to leaks, and (b) 'household' loues (35 %&#13;
of total production) due to, on one hand, defective appliances and building internal leakage and, on the other hand,&#13;
wasteful consumption practices ('coping strategies') intended at mitigating the 'rationing' effects of unreliable, only&#13;
intermittently available service. Net household consumption is 40% of total production. The sum of 'household&#13;
losses' and net household consumption is referred to as 'gross household consumption (demand)' and equals 75 % of&#13;
total production (i.e. 1.3 million m'Iday).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
(page 2 of 41&#13;
The investments related to these four components represent 76% of the total base cost of&#13;
the project. Health benefits derived from the improvement of water quality cannot be quantified with&#13;
available data, but are expected to add substantially to the economic merits of the project. Additionally,&#13;
the proposed project will also strengthen the operational, customer accounts and financial management&#13;
of RGAB and improve the prospects for any future private sector involvement.&#13;
4.                The following general assumptions were made for the economic evaluations:&#13;
(a)      the economic rates of return are not sensitive to changes in economic conditions since:&#13;
(i) increases in wages will reflect increases in productivity (basically through shedding&#13;
excess labor in RGAB); 2/&#13;
(ii) changes in the inflation rate will not affect relative prices, which are expressed as&#13;
constant mid 1995 prices; tradeables have been priced at their border prices;&#13;
(iii) the exchange rates will follow  changes in the international and domestic   inflation&#13;
rates, so that real exchange rates will remain constant;&#13;
(b)      Financial prices were converted to economic prices by subtracting taxes and duties.&#13;
Distortions in the domestic labor market, characterized by binding minimum wages and&#13;
unemployment, have not been taken into account. There is no sufficient information to&#13;
shadow price labor, an exercise that would have increased the returns of the proposed&#13;
projects by reducing the cost of the investments. The same would be true for the&#13;
calculation of conversion factors to account for the foreign exchange component of labor.&#13;
Analogically, the price of electricity which has been somewhat subsidized has not been&#13;
corrected for this distortion, (an omission that results in a more conservative estimate of&#13;
the benefits of the project).&#13;
(c)      Although RGAB has increased tariffs by 400 %  in real terms during the last four years,&#13;
the present tariff still is about 35% below the long-run marginal cost 3/ of providing&#13;
water to the consumers; the ensuing excess production results in costs that are higher than&#13;
the benefits derived from  wastage, (welfare losses). 4/&#13;
2        Although the number of employees per 1,000 people served is high in comparison to Western European countries (1.7&#13;
for RGAB versus an average of 0.5), and the number of employees per 1,000 connection even higher (46 for RGAB&#13;
versus an average of 1.5), labor costs of RGAB, because of low wages, currently represent 33 % of operating costs&#13;
(maintenanice and depreciation excluded), which is in line with levels observed in Germany, Great Britain and other&#13;
countries. Besides, given the high frequency of breaks experienced by RGAB (about ten times higher than by utilities&#13;
in Western countries) employment of a relatively large workforce of unskilled laborers is justified.&#13;
3        See AtLachment no.1 for estimates of the marginal cost of water supply produced.&#13;
4        Nomninal tariffs are 355 Lei/m3 (USS 0. 14) for water supply and 41 Lei/m3 (USS 0.02) for sewerage services. Because&#13;
of absenee of metering and the use of normative consumptions (170 I/p/d for cold water plus 110 I/p/d for hot water),&#13;
water consumption is invoiced as a defaco flat fee. Because of this, it cannot be contended that an increase in tariffs&#13;
to reduce demand would achieve some of the objectives pursued under the project. Metering is a precondition to&#13;
implementatii-n of a pricing policy that eeks to moderate customer demand, (see, however, footnote 6).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
[Pe 3 of 4)&#13;
(d)    Net household consumption will not be affected. As demonstrated by the experience of&#13;
similar projects in other countries, the increased reliability of water supply services which&#13;
will result in a reduction of need to resort to 'coping strategies' together with the&#13;
introduction of metering which will result in pricing the 'excess' consumption at its cost&#13;
(instead at zero cost at present) are expected to reduce the 'household losses' and result&#13;
in a reduction of 'gross household consumption'.&#13;
5.             The paragraphs below describe the cost-benefit analysis for each project component:&#13;
5.1            Costs and benefits for the rehabilitation of the primary and secondary networks were&#13;
calculated, in both cases, based on recent unit prices for similar civil works in Romania. Annual&#13;
maintenance costs for the existing network ('without project' case) were calculated on the basis of&#13;
estimates for the average unit cost of break repair. Maintenance costs for the networks after rehabilitation&#13;
('with project' case) were assumed at 1 % of the investment value for the primary network (because of&#13;
the more complex nature and material involved) and 0.5% for the secondary networks. In both cases&#13;
maintenance costs were assumed to increase over time to take into account normal wear and tear. Water&#13;
production cost per unit (i.e. ex-treatment plant cost) was assumed to remain the same with and without&#13;
the project. Benefits accruing to RGAB were measured on the basis of (a) a decrease in overall&#13;
production costs due to a reduction in the total volume of water to be produced as a result of loss&#13;
reduction; and (b) a decrease in distribution (pumping) costs due to a reduction of energy consumption&#13;
as result of the replacement of existing pumps by more energy-efficient units. All benefits were valued&#13;
at the short-run marginal cost of water produced which is US$ 0.04/m3. Energy consumption of pumps&#13;
was estimated on the basis of available data for existing technologies and valued at a cost of US$ 0.55&#13;
kwh (see Attachment I for calculation details).&#13;
5.2            Repair of primary network, The proposed investments of US$ 2.19 million (excluding&#13;
taxes) are expected to cause water losses to decrease from 62,000 m3/day to 25,000 m3/day. The resulting&#13;
IRR which was calculated taking into account both water savings and reduced maintenance costs, is 22%&#13;
(see Attachment 2). A sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the affects of (a) possible cost&#13;
overrun by 25%, (b) a 25% reduction in expected savings from water loss reduction, (c) an&#13;
implementation start up delayed by one year; and (d) a longer than anticipated implementation period of&#13;
five instead of three years. The results show that the IRR is robust. In the cases (a) and (b) it would&#13;
decrease from 22% to 17%, whereas in the cases (c) and (d) it would remain unaffected. 5/&#13;
5.3            Repair of secondary network . Investments in the repair of the secondary network, with&#13;
an estimated total cost of US$ 14.0 million (excluding taxes), will result in a reduction of water losses&#13;
from an actual 522 m3l/km/day (based on surveys carried out by the consultant) to about 50 m3/km/day&#13;
for the net 84 km of network section that will be repaired and/or replaced. The IRR for this component&#13;
which was is calculated taking into account both water savings and reduced maintenance costs is 129% (see&#13;
Attachment 3). The sensitivity analyses shows that (a) a cost overrun of 25% would reduce the IRR to&#13;
10%, and that like in the case of the primary network, the IRR would not be affected by a delayed start&#13;
up and/or longer than anticipated duration of implementation.&#13;
5      Trhe reason for this is that the network rehabilitation works carried out under the project generate cost and benefits that&#13;
are diacrete and strictly proportional and accrue simultaneously on a 'as it goes' basis.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 3&#13;
page 4 of 41&#13;
5.4             Rehabilitation of pumping stations.  The main benefits of this component whose&#13;
estimated total cost is US$ 6.1 million (excluding taxes), derive from the reduction of the energy costs&#13;
of water distribution. These benefits were calculated taking into account the amount of water that would&#13;
be necessary to satisfy the demand that would exist if water were priced at its long term marginal cost.&#13;
In that case, based on the experience of other countries, it can be assumed that gross water consumption&#13;
in Bucharest would be about 370 I/capita/day with a corresponding water production of 480 I/capita/day.&#13;
The benefits represent the difference between the energy costs of existing pumping equipment estimated&#13;
at US$ 0.021/m3 and those of new equipment provided under the project which are estimated at US$&#13;
0.017/m3. The resulting IRR would be 15%. The sensitivity analysis shows that (a) a cost overrun of&#13;
25 %  would reduce the IRR  to 11 % but that a longer than expected execution period would not affect&#13;
it significantly (see Attachment 4). 6/&#13;
5.5             Metering. The project would finance the installation of about 6,000 meters which are&#13;
expected to affect the demand for water of about 700,000 consumers. Based on the effects of metering&#13;
observed in other countries, it has been conservatively assumed that the demand for water would be&#13;
reduced by 10%. u The total cost of this component has been estimated at US$ 4.71 million (excluding&#13;
taxes). Given the limited lifetime of water meters (estimated at ten years) the investment effort would&#13;
have to be repeated every ten years to maintain benefits at their initial level. Benefits were calculated&#13;
as the difference between the production cost of the foregone water and the utility generated to the&#13;
consumer. The IRR of this component is 48% (see Attachment 5). The sensitivity analysis shows that&#13;
a cost overrun of 25% (and proportional reduction of the number of meters installed) would reduce the&#13;
IRR to 37%, whereas it would remain unaffected by a delay in project implementation start up and/or&#13;
a longer than anticipated duration of implementation. 4/ The IRR of this component is, however,&#13;
extremely sensitive to consumer response. It would drop to 19% if the expected savings in water&#13;
consumption would be only 5% instead of 10%, as assumed in the base case.&#13;
6       Most of the meters will not be installed to individual households but to groups of consumers within apartment&#13;
buildings (staircase units), hence the high number of consumers affected by the program. The rationale for this is that,&#13;
for technical reasons, the installation of individual household meters in apartment buildings is, in most cases,&#13;
impossible. Under these circumstance, a consumption reduction by about 10% seemed more realistic an assumption&#13;
than one of about 30% which has been observed in countries that d not have this sort of constraint.&#13;

Marginal Cost of Water Supply&#13;
A. Short Run Marginal Cost&#13;
The short run marginal cost of water produced was estmated by dividing the current daily operating costs by the total&#13;
number of daily produced m3 of water.&#13;
Daily operating costs for 1995 (in US$) were estimated as follows (using the 1995 average exchange rate):&#13;
Energy                                                 40,600&#13;

Total                               US$/day            59,300&#13;
With a current production of 1,690,000 m3/day the resulting short run marginal cost of water produced is:&#13;
Short Run Maralnal Cost of Water Produced  (US$/m3)              0.04   (excluding taxes)&#13;
B. Long Term Marainal Cost&#13;
The long term marginal cost of water produced was calculated by taking into account the costs of the new Crivina&#13;
Ogrezeni Treatment Plant, and the operating costs above.&#13;
-        Costs of Crivina-Ogrezeni Treatment Plant: US$ 100 million (including taxes)&#13;

PUBLIC AWARENESS AND WATER WASTAGE REDUCTION CAMPAIGN&#13;
FINANCIAL INCENTIVES AND TARIFF STUDIES&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
1.      Introduction: A major part of the water losses that occur in Bucharest originate at the household level. Because water&#13;
is billed on the basis of a normative consumption regardless of the quantity actually consumed households have no incentive&#13;
to reduce consumption or repair leaks or defective appliances. The issue of wasteful household behavior has been aggravated&#13;
by the necessity for many people to resort, in the context of only intermittent availability of water, to 'coping strategies', that&#13;
is to devise solutions to catch and store as much water as possible during periods of availability. The permanence of these&#13;
problems for an extended period of time has created a series of behavioral reflexes that are difficult to change and will, together&#13;
with the provision of material/monetary incentives and changes in the tariff regime, require an important educational effort.&#13;
2.      Scope of Proposed Work: RGAB with the support of consultants will develop a three-pronged approach to raise public&#13;
awareness for water conservation needs and introduce changes into the water use practices of Bucharest households:&#13;
(a)     education and information&#13;
(I)     preparation of advertising campaigns in different media (written press, radio, TV, billboard posters, etc) to&#13;
inform population on water conservation issues;&#13;
(ii)    development of educational programs for kindergartens and primary schools;&#13;
(iii)   association of newspapers for the diffusion of information articles on general water and sewerage issuies,&#13;
technical and financial aspects of water supply and waste water management, and other related issues&#13;
(including progress on the implementation of the proposed project);&#13;
(b)     incentives&#13;
(i)     identification of possible financial incentives for RGAB customers taking into account the particular fact that&#13;
for technical reasons the installation of individual household meters is impossible for a majority of consumers&#13;
and water billing can only be done at the level of apartment groups (staircase units) or entire buildings. Since&#13;
these groups often show a great social and economic heterogeneity, socio-psychological aspects will need&#13;
to be paid careful attention in identifying possible solutions.&#13;
(specific terms of reference to be prepared in association with consultants providing assistance for cusromner&#13;
account management improvement).&#13;
lii)   study and development of pilot programs for repair and appliance replacement promotion programs.&#13;
(specific terms of reference to be prepared in association with consultants providing assistance for customer&#13;
account management improvement).&#13;
(c)     tariff regime&#13;
(l)     study on possible modifications of the current tariff structure, based on (a) an accurate assessment of the&#13;
current and expected future water production and distribution costs (taking into account the actions included&#13;
in the FIP); and (b) an evaluation of the customers' affordability and ability to pay for public utility services&#13;
(including, in addition to water supply, district heating and transport).&#13;
(ii)    development of proposals for a new tariff structure with a view to equate prices with the long run marginal&#13;
cost.&#13;
(specific terms of reference to be prepared in association with consultants providing assistance for customer&#13;
account management improvement and upon completion of the studies under para. 2 (b) above).&#13;

OPERATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
1.              Objectives: At present, owing to the lack of flow metering and automated flow control devices, production&#13;
and distribution of water in Bucharest is not operated in with adequate efficiency. Statistical information on production and&#13;
consumption is virtually non existent and, in most cases, treated manually. Data on existing networks, especially at the&#13;
secondary network level, are unreliable. There are no mechanisms to monitor changes in consumer behavior in reaction to the&#13;
introduction of metering under the project. Such mechanisms will have to be set up to enable RGAB to (a) oversee the&#13;
implementation of the project; (b) assess the effects on production and consumption produced by the project; {c) draw the&#13;
lessons from the implementation experience and make changes where necessary; and (d) acquire the data basis for the&#13;
preparation of follow up operations.&#13;
2.               Scope of Proposed Work: The technical assistance will include the following two components:&#13;
tat     Improvement of water production and distribution management&#13;
training of RGAB personnel in the operation of the flow control systems implemented under the project,&#13;
as well as new water treatment equipment;&#13;
preparation, and assistance in the implementation of, new operating programs for production and&#13;
distribution, including the use of computerized dispatching programs;&#13;
creation of computerized data acquisition and data management programs for operation-related&#13;
information, including the monitoring of production and consumption pattern changes in connection with&#13;
the introduction of metering; and&#13;
creation of a model for demand analysis and forecasting based on (i) the information and social&#13;
experience gained from the implementation of the metering program; and (ii) the data on customer&#13;
behavior generated under the technical assistance program for the improvement of RGAB's customer&#13;
account management system.&#13;
(b)     Monitoring of the effects of the rehabilitation programs&#13;
installation of flow meters allowing the measuring of flow regimes and consumption (demand) changes&#13;
in the areas to be rehabilitated;&#13;
comprehensive survey (including mapping and record of technical data on materials, etc..) of all RGAB&#13;
infrastructure and service connections identified within the areas;&#13;
continuous monitoring of changes in the flow regime during the implementation of the rehabilitation;&#13;
preparation of monitoring programs for the period following the implementation of the rehabilitation; and&#13;
analysis of work implementation experience including detailed evaluation of technical, time and, possibly,&#13;
legal or regulatory constraints, population reaction, costs Iper type and material of pipes and&#13;
connections,..etc).&#13;
