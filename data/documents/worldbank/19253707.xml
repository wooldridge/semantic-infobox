    T       his study investigates an attempt to eco-&#13;
            nomically and socially empower some of&#13;
            the poorest and most vulnerable young&#13;
    women in one of the poorest and most fragile places&#13;
                                                             ment. Unfortunately, conflict and crisis-affected&#13;
                                                             countries are not all that rare. Also, in most low and&#13;
                                                             middle-income countries (conflicted or not), the&#13;
                                                             very poorest are similar in many ways to the very&#13;
    in the world: northern Uganda.                           poorest in northern Uganda. They are often young&#13;
                                                             people, more often than not female, who have few&#13;
    We experimentally evaluate the intervention to an-       skills and capital, little prospect of earning a living,&#13;
    swer a series of bigger questions in aid and develop-    and, to the extent they are dislocated from their fam-&#13;
    ment:                                                    ily or community, have little of the support needed&#13;
    First, does providing inputs like cash and business      to survive another bad shock.&#13;
    skills help the very poorest build sustainable sourc-    Governments and aid organizations in nearly every&#13;
    es of income? If so, what does this tell us about the    country deal with women and men like this every&#13;
    causes of poverty and the constraints holding back       day, and how to empower themâ&#128;&#148;literally, to in-&#13;
    the poor?                                                crease their economic and social strengthâ&#128;&#148;is a con-&#13;
    Second, does such economic empowerment (like             stant question with few clear answers.&#13;
    reduced poverty and sustainable businesses) lead&#13;
                                                             Perhaps the most common approach is to give poor&#13;
    to broader forms of empowerment (like increased&#13;

    independence and reduced risk of violence)? How&#13;
                                                             and other things that go into production. These&#13;

                                                             prises. Such interventions make a couple of crucial&#13;
    brothers?&#13;
                                                             assumptions. One is that the very poor can use these&#13;
    Third, does economic empowerment have social and         inputs productivelyâ&#128;&#148;that there are high returns&#13;
    psychological benefits as well? That is, do poverty      to these inputs. A second is that they are somehow&#13;
    relief and sustainable new businesses increase social    constrained from obtaining these inputs in the ab-&#13;
    support and decrease psychological distress among        sence of the intervention. If one or both of these as-&#13;
    a war-affected, relatively excluded population?          sumptions are false, then we should see little change&#13;

     We are not solely interested in the benefit, but rather&#13;
     the benefit relative to costs. One way to do this is      So far we have focused mainly on the material ben-&#13;

     Most of all, we would like to see if the return is        in community support? These benefits are (literally)&#13;

     More than this, we would like to see that a program&#13;

     that it provides a higher return than the alternatives.&#13;

     One way to do this is to compare the program and&#13;
     its returns with those from other interventions. That     The top panel, A, describes the return from the full&#13;

                                                               To estimate the stream of earnings, we can look at&#13;
     Evidence on returns from different interventions          the average treatment effect (of roughly 16,200&#13;

     turn of 40 to 100 percent.                                look at 5, 15 and 50 year horizons.&#13;

We set out to write a report that is free of exces-        would be less than 1%. Since the probability is so&#13;

to present findings in meaningful terms, our prose         program had no impact on earnings. We would say&#13;
aided by several tables and figures. While we believe      that the result is â&#128;&#156;significant.â&#128;&#157; This is different than&#13;
that the lessons of the report can be understood           saying that the magnitude of the result is large; mag-&#13;

concepts that are good to review.                          above. Taken together, significance and magnitude&#13;
                                                           help us know what to make of our results.&#13;
Impact or effect size&#13;
                                                           Confidence intervals&#13;
Simply put, impact refers to the size of the difference&#13;
between groups when evaluating outcomes. In this           Another way to evaluate our results is to report con-&#13;
report, impact will often be stated as the average dif-    fidence intervals. Statistical tests are never exact,&#13;
ference between people who received the WINGS              and we always have some degree of error in what we&#13;
program in Phase 1 (treatment) and people who did          set out to measure. Confidence intervals tell us the&#13;
not (control). This difference can be framed as an ab-     range of values that our finding could take. For in-&#13;
solute value (e.g., increase of UGX 10,000, roughly        stance, we might report that the average effect size&#13;
USD 4.02) for the average WINGS beneficiary) or            is UGX 10,000, but because there is some error in&#13;
as a percentage (e.g., increase of 100% for the aver-      this estimate, we would also report that the â&#128;&#156;trueâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
age WINGS beneficiary).                                    effect size falls somewhere between UGX 8,000 and&#13;
                                                           12,000 (USD 3.21 â&#128;&#147; 4.82). Often we report the 95%&#13;
Statistical significance                                   confidence interval, meaning that the â&#128;&#156;trueâ&#128;&#157; value&#13;
                                                           would be fall in this interval in 95 out of 100 stud-&#13;
You will notice in our tables that we report prob-         ies. If we wanted to be more confident, say 99%, our&#13;
abilities known as p-values. When p-values are less        confidence interval would expand (e.g., UGX 6,000&#13;
than the generally accepted cutoffs (1%, 5%, 10%),         to 14,000 â&#128;&#147; USD 2.41 - 5.62). We always want the&#13;
we indicate this with one or more asterisks. P-values      confidence interval to be small; the smaller the inter-&#13;
help us to evaluate our study hypotheses. The de-          val the more precise our estimate of impact (better&#13;
fault hypothesis is always that there are no differ-       surveys lead to more precise measurement, which is&#13;
ences between the treatment and control groups, or         why we take so long preparing!).&#13;
that the program has no impact. When we detect a&#13;
difference, we use the p-value to evaluate whether         Average, mean and median&#13;
we should reject the default hypothesis that there&#13;
are no differences and conclude that the program           The term â&#128;&#156;averageâ&#128;&#157; refers to the central value of a&#13;

For instance, letâ&#128;&#153;s say that the average WINGS ben-        the control group. The arithmetic mean and the me-&#13;

            This study investigates an attempt to
            economically and socially empower some of the poorest and
            most vulnerable young women in one of the poorest and most
            fragile places in the world: northern Uganda. Investing in
            women is said to be a key to development. Educate her, buy
            her a cow or goat, or help her start a business and great
            things will follow: sustained increases in income, greater
            empowerment and social inclusion, health and education for
            the children, and (especially in war-affected regions)
            mental health and happiness. This report provides
            provisional answers to these questions based on data
            collected from April 2009 to August 2012. The questions will
            continue to be explored and analyzed in academic papers in
            future, but the authors attempt to draw out the key findings
            and policy lessons as close to the end of the intervention
            and data collection as possible.
