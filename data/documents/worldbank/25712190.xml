Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
i.	After four years of a steady recovery,               abate, to 3.1 percent in August 2015 yoy, reflecting&#13;
Jordanâ&#128;&#153;s economy is expected to slowdown in             the fading impact of one-off demand and supply&#13;
2015 due to the effects of security spillovers          shocks.&#13;
particularly in the first half of the year. These&#13;
included repercussions, particularly on tourism         iv.	Monetary policy remains expansionary&#13;
and trade, from the worsening of security situation     while tight fiscal policy persists. In line with a&#13;
in Syria and Iraq and total trade route closures with   deflationary environment and widening output&#13;
these two countries. With over 631,000 registered       gap, the Central Bank of Jordan cut policy rates by&#13;
Syrian refugees, Jordan grapples with a range of        25 bps in July 2015 (to a cumulative 125 bps since&#13;
development challenges including worsening              July 2013). The central government fiscal deficit&#13;
unemployment (average rate in the first half of         improved in the first seven months of 2015 largely&#13;
2015 (H1-2015) reaching 12.5 percent compared           driven by lower expenditures outweighing a fall in&#13;
to 11.9 percent in H1-2014).                            revenues as a share of GDP and is projected to&#13;
                                                        reach 4.1 percent of GDP for the year. Combined&#13;
ii.	     The modest recovery to 3.1 percent real        with moderate growth, this will push the debt-to-&#13;
growth in 2014 was unexpectedly cut short in            GDP ratio higher. The IMF Stand-By Arrangement&#13;
Q1 and recovered slightly in Q2 2015. From              was completed successfully disbursing close to&#13;
the production side, the slowdown to 2.2 percent        US$ 400 million in August 2015.&#13;
growth year on year (yoy) in H1-2015 (the slowest&#13;
since H1-2010) was led by a contraction in â&#128;&#152;hotels      v.	      The current account is expected to widen&#13;
and restaurantsâ&#128;&#153;, construction, and agriculture         in 2015 as lower energy imports will be more&#13;
(by 4.3 percent, 1.0 percent and 0.8 percent            than offset by conflict-related trade disruptions&#13;
respectively), while growth was spurred largely         and lower transfers. The current account deficit&#13;
by â&#128;&#152;mining and quarryingâ&#128;&#153; and finance, insurance        narrowed in H1-2015 (to 4.2 percent of GDP) due&#13;
and business services. From the demand side,            to a 6.3 percentage points of GDP fall in imports&#13;
growth was driven by net exports, while private         of goods and services (driven by lower energy&#13;
demand remained flat, and public investment and         imports) partly offset by a 4.3 percentage points&#13;
government consumption subtracted from growth           of GDP fall in exports of goods and services on&#13;
(in real terms) over the first half of 2015 compared    account of trade disruptions and softer grants and&#13;
to H1-2014. Real GDP growth is projected at             remittances. For the year, the current account&#13;
2.5 percent in 2015, 100bps below the previous          deficit is expected to reach 7.1 percent of GDP,&#13;
forecast, dragged down by Q1â&#128;&#153;s events.                  partly due to the fading impact of lower oil&#13;
                                                        pricesâ&#128;&#148;as these started to decline in June 2014â&#128;&#148;&#13;
iii.	Declining commodity prices, a strong               and higher non-oil imports.&#13;
exchange rate and a negative output gap sustain&#13;
a deflationary environment. Headline consumer           vi.	   Jordanâ&#128;&#153;s main challenge continues to&#13;
prices contracted by 0.7 percent yoy compared to        be the management of security spillovers from&#13;
August 2014 and minus 0.6 percent on a period           Syria and Iraq. The baseline, which forecasts real&#13;

&#13;
    H1-2015 events were largely one-off occurrence&#13;
    except for lingering effects on trade. Any further&#13;
    exacerbation presents the largest downside risk,&#13;
    followed by a sharp rebound in international oil&#13;
    prices. The availability of external financing given&#13;
    weak global capital market conditions are also to&#13;
    be monitored. Structural reforms particularly on&#13;
    the energy diversification and improving business&#13;
    climate fronts bode well for medium-term growth.&#13;

                         BOX 1. Jordanâ&#128;&#153;s Continued Drive to Reform its Water and Energy Sectors&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 The energy and water sectors have suffered from structural inefficiencies which have resulted in large and&#13;
 unsustainable fiscal costs. Jordanâ&#128;&#153;s historic vulnerability to global fuel prices fluctuations, coupled with the frequent&#13;
 interruptions in the import of piped natural gas from Egypt from 2011 onwards prompted Jordan to import more&#13;
 expensive diesel and fuel oil. The Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s initial decision not to pass-through the higher fuel costs to final&#13;
 consumers resulted in a significant increase in the National Electricity Power Companyâ&#128;&#153;s (NEPCO) operating losses.&#13;
 As a result, NEPCO has been running deficits equivalent to around 4-5 percent of GDP per year since 2011 and has&#13;
 accumulated total operating losses of about JD4.7 billion by end of 2014, for which debt servicing has until recently&#13;
 been directly covered by the budget. On the water front, Jordan has historically grappled with water scarcity and&#13;
 is the second most water scarce country in the world1. High subsidies in the water sector result in inefficient use&#13;
 of resources. Jordan has become more dependent on non-conventional, and often very energy-intensive, water&#13;
 infrastructure causing the water sector to add further budgetary losses equivalent to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2014.&#13;
&#13;
 To improve these inefficiencies and to create fiscal space, reforms have been undertaken, in part supported&#13;
 by the World Bank. These developments from 2011 and onwards encouraged the Government to develop and&#13;
 implement programs to gradually reform its electricity and water subsidies and diversify and reduce the cost of&#13;
 energy supply. This was planned to be achieved through the development of domestic renewable energy resources&#13;
 and alternate natural gas supply options for power generation, and implementation of water sector reforms that aim&#13;
 to optimize the allocation of water resources, while reducing the use of energy in the sector. In order to support&#13;
 these reform programs in the water and energy sectors, the World Bank approved a US$250 million loan to finance&#13;
 the First Programmatic Energy and Water Sector Reforms Development Policy Loan (DPL) on September 18, 2015.&#13;
&#13;
 The focus of the reforms in the energy and water sectors is to improve the financial viability and increase&#13;
 efficiency gains in both sectors. Specific policies in the electricity sector supported by the proposed DPL aim to&#13;
 restore the electricity sector to full cost recovery in 2017 through a coordinated program of tariff adjustments and&#13;
 cost reduction measures including (i) implementation of a five-year (2013-2017) electricity tariff adjustment plan;&#13;
 (ii) development of a floating terminal in the port of Aqaba, which started operation in July 2015, to import Liquefied&#13;
 Natural Gas and increase its share fuel supply by more than 70 percent instead of more expensive diesel; and (iii)&#13;
 scaling up development domestic renewable energy resources which is expected to reach 10 percent of the power&#13;
 generation mix by 2017. The implementation of these DPL-supported policies and achievement of their results could&#13;
 yield significant increase in revenues and cost savings totaling JD1.7 billion2 in the electricity sector over the 2015-&#13;
 2017 period. On the water sector front, the DPL supports (i) the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s plan to reform water tariffs to achieve&#13;
 operation and maintenance cost recovery in the water sector by 2017, (ii) enacting a series of water sector policies&#13;
 that aim to scale up implementation of energy efficiency and renewable energy in the water sector to achieve annual&#13;
 energy efficiency savings of 50 GWh in 2017, and (iii) optimizing the allocation of water resources to increase the&#13;
 use of surface water by municipalities and the volume of treated wastewater used for non-domestic consumption.&#13;
&#13;
 Such reforms are expected to result in significant fiscal space. The successful implementation of the reform&#13;
 programs in the water and energy sectors will decrease their burden on future government budgets. The resulting&#13;
 increase in fiscal space will allow the Government to invest in pro poor programs and other more inclusive programs&#13;
 that will improve the standard of living of the population in Jordan. Combined with other reforms in improving the&#13;
 business climate and in line with Vision 2025 (Box 3), the economy would achieve a higher growth path.&#13;

                                                                                       BOX 2. Output Gap Analysis&#13;
&#13;
     Policy makers are interested in how much spare capacity exists in the economy in order to design appropriate&#13;
     economic policies. One way is to estimate the difference between potential output (with fully employed factors of&#13;
     production) versus actual output.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     As there are significant uncertainties surrounding output gap estimates, alternative estimation techniques are&#13;
     employed. The output gap for Jordan is estimated on annual data over the sample period 1975-2017 as well as on&#13;
     quarterly data over the sample period Q1-1992 to Q1-2016. The Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter, a de-trending statistical&#13;
     method, is employed using three standard smoothing parameters. To minimize the end-point bias that the HP filter&#13;
     is normally susceptible to, the annual sample period is extended through 2017 while the quarter sample period is&#13;
     extended through Q1-2016 using World Bank staff projections. The annual output gap is also estimated using a Pro-&#13;
     duction Function model (as of 1990), which is a structural method incorporating economic theory that relates output&#13;
     to total factor productivity and production inputs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The alternative estimation methods yield different magnitudes of the output gap in most periods; neverthe-&#13;
     less, the trajectories they generate are highly correlated. From the mid-1990s until mid-2000s, the economy was&#13;
     running below its potential and the output gap was widening until 2004, when a high growth period ensued and&#13;
     lasted until 2009 (Figure 15). The output gap trajectory reverted in 2004 and by 2009 it had reached 5.43 percent of&#13;
     potential output (on average across the four estimation methodologies).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Since 2013 the economy has been below its potential and the output gap has been widening. The magnitudes&#13;
     of the quarterly output gap estimates from the different HP filters are very close (Figure 14). However, depending&#13;
     on the smoothing parameter adopted, output in 2014 is estimated at above or below potential. The output gap from&#13;
     the HP filter with a smoothing parameter of 1600, the standard parameter used in the literature for quarterly data, is&#13;
     negative in all quarters of 2014. This is in line with the annual data. Output gap further widens to reach -1 percent&#13;
     of potential output in the first quarter of 2015 which is the lowest gap since the fourth quarter of 2006. The gap nar-&#13;
     rows by the second quarter of 2015 but is still negative at -0.42 percent of potential output. All estimation methods&#13;
     reveal that, following the sharp and persistent economic slowdown of 2010, the large positive output gap that existed&#13;
     in 2009 starts narrowing, turns negative in 2013 and further widens in 2014 (Figure 15). The output gap estimates&#13;
     for 2014 from the different methods range from -0.29 percent to -1.36 percent of potential output with an average&#13;
     of -1.01 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Despite the uncertainty in estimating a countryâ&#128;&#153;s output gap, the various estimates shown above all indicate&#13;
     that Jordanâ&#128;&#153;s economy is currently operating below its full capacity. This is further reinforced by other capacity&#13;
     indicators, such as in the labor market.&#13;

In 2014, banksâ&#128;&#153; nonperforming loans (NPL) ratio&#13;
had improved for the first time since 2011 at 5.6&#13;
percent, further improving to 5.4 percent by end-&#13;
June 2015, compared to 7.0 percent end-2013 and&#13;
the lowest since 2008 (4.2 percent). Banksâ&#128;&#153; Return&#13;
on Equity (ROE) and Return on Assets (ROA) also&#13;
both improved reaching 11.0 percent and 1.4&#13;
percent respectively by end-June 2015, the highest&#13;
rates since 2008 (Table 1). The capital adequacy&#13;
ratio decreased to 17.8 percent by end-June 2015&#13;
compared to end-2014 while the leverage ratio&#13;
decreased from 12.9 percent end-2013 to 12.5&#13;

the twin deficits. This pressure, previously a larger&#13;
and significant risk factor, is now being mitigated&#13;
as Jordan reduces its oil price exposure via energy&#13;
diversification efforts and energy sector reforms&#13;
such as NEPCO tariff adjustments. The availability of&#13;
external financing is a downside risk given uncertain&#13;
global capital market conditions. This pertains to&#13;
lower grants expected in 2015 compared to 2014&#13;
and to the availability of private sector financing&#13;
to support an announced non-US guaranteed&#13;
Eurobond transaction in October. While the Federal&#13;
Open Market Committeeâ&#128;&#153;s (FOMC) September&#13;
2015 meeting did not raise interest rates, there are&#13;
expectations it could still do so before the end of&#13;
the year. Should this materialize, however, it is not&#13;
expected that the pass through would be significant&#13;
for Jordan, at least not in the short-term. Markets&#13;
also expect the FOMC to tighten rates very gradually&#13;
and in small increments.&#13;
&#13;

diversification and improving the business&#13;
climate bode well for medium-term growth&#13;
provided Jordan can weather the challenges of&#13;
a precarious neighboring security situation. As&#13;
such, progress on the energy diversification front is&#13;
welcome to reduce Jordanâ&#128;&#153;s dependency on more&#13;
expensive and polluting diesel and fuel oils which it&#13;
has resorted to since disruptions of natural gas from&#13;
Egypt as of 2011. The LNG terminal at Aqaba has&#13;
been operational since July 2015 and is expected to&#13;
yield savings of JD820 million over the 2015-2017&#13;
period.9 As part of its energy strategy, Jordan is&#13;
projected to increase its share of natural gas supply&#13;
for power generation from 7 percent in 2014 to 70&#13;
percent by 2017 and is also expected to build up&#13;
the share of renewable power in the generation mix&#13;
to 10 percent by 2017. On the business climate&#13;
front, the Government has been designing different&#13;
initiatives to enhance the business environment by&#13;
reviewing procedures and related legislation with&#13;
expected implementation in Q4-2015.&#13;

                           BOX 3. Jordan 2025: An Economic and Social Development Vision for Jordan&#13;
&#13;
     The Jordanian government launched Vision 2025 â&#128;&#156;Blueprintâ&#128;&#157;, a new ten-year strategy in May 2015. The vision&#13;
     and strategy which includes more than 400 policies and procedures was designed in an extensive consultative process&#13;
     involving the private sector and citizens. Implementation of the strategy is expected over three executive development&#13;
     plans, with the first for 2016-2018 finalized end-September aligned with the 2016-2018 budget. The strategy&#13;
     acknowledges the need for strong partnership among key stakeholders and for its effective implementation. Depending&#13;
     on progress achieved, it offers two scenarios with the targeted scenario achieving real growth rates of 7.5 percent by&#13;
     2025 with the baseline scenario achieving a 4.8 percent growth rate.&#13;
&#13;
     Vision 2025 places citizens at the heart of the development process, defining its main goal as improving the&#13;
     welfare of citizens, with society, business and government as the other three main pillars. Relatedly, it stresses&#13;
     improving basic services to citizens, creating a balanced society with opportunities available to all, more equal&#13;
     development by bridging gaps between governorates and giving citizens more of a voice. The strategy presents current&#13;
     social and economic outcomes across a number of macroeconomic and development indicators such as in health,&#13;
     education and employment and social outcomes related to the rule of law, citizenship and poverty, and compares these&#13;
     across countries for benchmarking purposes. It also highlights the business environment and government performance&#13;
     including in the provision of services and management of resources and presents desired outcomes for indicators for&#13;
     each pillar (Refer to Figure 16).&#13;
&#13;
     The strategy is guided by seven core principles. These â&#128;&#156;principles for collective actionâ&#128;&#157; stress the rule of law including&#13;
     improving the transparency and accessibility of government information, improving meritocracy by moving away from&#13;
     favoritism towards equal opportunity, and promoting a more participatory culture, away from entitlement and to active&#13;
     citizenship. Excellence is another embedded principle, setting higher standards to achieve global best practice levels&#13;
     across the economy and services. The strategy focuses on improved competitiveness to shift from a small, domestic&#13;
     economy to a dynamic regional hub. Sustainability features as a key principle as well, with a focus on achieving&#13;
     sustainable and inclusive growth as well shifting towards institutionalized rather than personalized decision making.&#13;
&#13;
     Vision 2025 calls for a transformation of Jordanâ&#128;&#153;s model of development to achieve growth and prosperity based&#13;
     on competitiveness and providing more employment opportunities. The strategy identifies priority export markets&#13;
     beyond the current regional crisis with a target to become a regional hub for the GCC, Palestine, Iraq, Syria, Egypt and&#13;
     Libya and the farther markets of Turkey and Iran. It also identifies priority clusters to drive growth and create jobs both&#13;
     building on existing strengths and identifying opportunities in new clusters based on emerging trends. The clusters&#13;
     are grouped in construction and engineering and housing, transportation and logistics, tourism, healthcare and health&#13;
     tourism, energy and renewable energy, information technology and innovation, agriculture, educational services, and&#13;
     financial services.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
         The tech startup ecosystem has distinctive terminology and concepts. One way of understanding the tech aspect of&#13;
         startups is that if the Internet did not exist, it is unlikely these companies would exist either. There is no official definition&#13;
         of a startup. One proposal suggests that a startup is less than three years old, not gone public or been acquired, has&#13;
         no more than 80 employees or revenue that exceeds US$20 million.17 Special spaces have sprung up to serve the&#13;
         needs of the startup. Co-working offices have open plans and broadband Internet access. An incubator offers office&#13;
         space plus training over a fixed period. Like an incubator, an accelerator provides workspace as well as mentoring and&#13;
         funding in exchange for equity in the startup. Funding options are split into early and later stages. Early stage includes&#13;
         seed money to build and deploy an initial product. The money could come from the startup founderâ&#128;&#153;s own resources&#13;
         or friends and family. Another source are angels, typically successful serial entrepreneurs or early stage venture capital&#13;
         funds. Later stage funding comes after the startup has demonstrated commercial potential and often flows in several&#13;
         rounds termed Series A for the first, Series B for the second and so on. This is usually provided by venture capital funds&#13;
         managed by investment specialists that understand the tech sector and the risks involved; they often play an active&#13;
         role in the finances of the startup. Another source of investment is crowd funding. This is carried out through special&#13;
         Internet platforms allowing the startup to solicit funding from small investors in exchange for equity.&#13;

    57.	     Jordan has been witnessing the emergence                     with Maktoob the prime example.&#13;
    of a vibrant tech startup ecosystem. While the initial&#13;
    ICT strategy was using outsourcing as a platform                      59.	     Jordanâ&#128;&#153;s small domestic market is a&#13;
    to tap into the global information economy, the                       weakness in terms of demand for innovative&#13;
    government has increasingly recognized the value of                   services and building scale for startups. This&#13;
    its own latent potential to trigger innovation through                is compensated to some extent by having start-&#13;
    entrepreneurship. The Arabic web portal Maktoob                       ups target the Arab market and has influenced the&#13;

    Arabic web content is produced in Jordan.59                           is that once Jordanian tech firms become successful&#13;

                            BOX 5. Tech Startup Supporting Policy Program in Lebanon - MIEP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The Mobile Internet Ecosystem Program was designed as a World Bank lending project to support the development&#13;
     of the tech startup ecosystem in Lebanon with focus on mobile internet.&#13;
&#13;
     The objective of the program is to: i) increase local entrepreneurship and innovation, ii) enhance employability for the&#13;
     youth, and iii) retain talent in Lebanon. The program will be implemented by the Mobile Innovation Hub (MiHub),&#13;
     an NGO owned by the ecosystem stakeholders (eg, academia, private sector, financing, civil society) and where the&#13;
     government is present.&#13;
&#13;
     The program has three lines of action to support the ecosystem:&#13;
     1.	 Creation of the community of entrepreneurs by developing community building events (eg., meet-ups, workshops,&#13;
         trainings, and competitions with acceleration)&#13;
     2.	 Strengthening of the tech skills pipeline, working with universities through apprentices programs, middle and high&#13;
         schools to introduce tech skills and rapid tech skills training programs (eg coding bootcamps)&#13;
     3.	 Introducing innovation in local industries by connecting entrepreneurs with established industries through open&#13;
         innovation processes and experimentation labs for new technology testing and prototyping in real industry&#13;
         environments.&#13;
&#13;
     These lines of action are dynamic and will be modified or additional actions will be added by the MiHub as required&#13;
     by the ecosystem needs.&#13;

       coordinate actions of the ecosystem actors                     driven. Events, meet ups and ad hoc training&#13;
       (avoiding redundancies) and foster collaboration               support the development of these communities.&#13;
       and public-private participation models to                     Step out spaces may also be needed to allow&#13;
       support the community of entrepreneurs (Box                    for startup growth. Seed investment pipelines&#13;

       arrangements, business plan and program                        support scaling up. Both space and finance&#13;

                                            BOX 6. Local Innovation Hub&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Although there is no common definition of an innovation hub, this concept can be applied to define the evolution&#13;
 of collaboration spaces into community managers that coordinate or integrate many of the other functions of&#13;
 collaboration spaces such as coworking spaces, maker spaces, fablabs, accelerators, living labs, and urban labs&#13;
 (see source below for description of these spaces). Innovation hubsâ&#128;&#153; main function is to coordinate all actors of the&#13;
 ecosystem and help manage the community of tech-innovators and entrepreneurs to grow sustainably. Many of&#13;
 these innovation hubs enjoy the participation of the most relevant actors of the technology innovation ecosystem,&#13;
 including entrepreneurs, universities, private sector, collaboration spaces, accelerators, incubators, other providers&#13;
 of seed capital, community managers, and government â&#128;&#148; particularly city government. Some of these innovation&#13;
 hubs have collaboration spaces in their facilities, such as co-working and maker spaces, while others coordinate&#13;
 their functions with those spaces. Typically, these hubs will phase out their other functions when there are enough&#13;
 offerings for the community provided by third parties. Examples vary from Ruta N, Medellin (which is part of the&#13;
 city government), to NUMA in Paris (which is a grass-root hub built with the community of local entrepreneurs),&#13;
 with Forum Virium, Helsinki, as a middle point (a PPP model owned 50 percent by the city and 50 percent by the&#13;
 ecosystemâ&#128;&#153;s stakeholders). Citilab, Hospitalet de Llobregat, Waag Society, Amsterdam, and Urban Lab, Barcelona,&#13;
 are other examples of innovation hubs. The World Bank designed and implemented the innovation hub model in the&#13;
 Lebanon: Mobile Internet Ecosystem Project (see Box above).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
includes implementing open innovation processes&#13;
with existing industry, labs to experiment with new&#13;
technology approaches to industry processes (e.g.,&#13;
digital manufacturing), and customized accelerator&#13;
programs directed at specific industries (e.g., a&#13;
â&#128;&#156;fintechâ&#128;&#157; accelerator for the finance industry).&#13;
Similarly, government can leverage the tech startup&#13;
ecosystem by introducing open innovation for service&#13;
delivery and competitions for startups to address&#13;
public challenges. Municipal governments can act as&#13;
catalyzers of a government open innovation policy&#13;
by presenting urban challenges and providing testing&#13;
facilities and spaces for entrepreneurs. By leveraging&#13;
open innovation through municipal governments,&#13;
Jordan can expand the entrepreneurship ecosystem&#13;
beyond Amman, where it is mostly concentrated&#13;
(Box 6).&#13;

    are major contributors to its competitiveness and        is conducted every quarter. This approach offers&#13;
    employment potential. The situation has only             alternate annual poverty estimates for Jordan. Based&#13;

the level of governorates. The Vector Autoregression&#13;
(VAR) methodology has been adopted on panel&#13;
data that involves a cross-section of governorates&#13;
in Jordan, during the time period Q4 2007 to Q3&#13;
2013. We find evidence suggesting that the Syrian&#13;
refugees are causing a reduction in the national labor&#13;
force participation rate of Jordanians. Preliminary&#13;
analysis reveals this could be the result of refugees&#13;
willing to work for relatively low wages, causing a&#13;
large increase in discouraged Jordanian workers (as&#13;
these have a reservation wage that they perceive&#13;
cannot be satisfied under the current environment&#13;
and therefore prefer to drop out of the labor force&#13;
altogether; since these discouraged workers are no&#13;
longer searching for jobs, they are not counted in the&#13;
rank of the unemployed). Given Jordanâ&#128;&#153;s previously&#13;
low labor force participation rate prior to the Syrian&#13;
conflict, the recent drop in the participation rate is a&#13;
source of concern.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Jordan economic monitor provides an
            update on key economic developments and policies over the
            past six months. It also presents findings from recent World
            Bank work on Jordan. It places them in a longer-term and
            global context, and assesses the implications of these
            developments and other changes in policy for the outlook for
            the country. Its coverage ranges from the macro-economy to
            financial markets to indicators of human welfare and
            development. It is intended for a wide audience, including
            policy makers, business leaders, financial market
            participants, and the community of analysts and
            professionals engaged in Jordan.
