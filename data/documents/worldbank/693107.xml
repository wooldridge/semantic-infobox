            Regulating banks through public disclosure
            - the case of New Zealand
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            New Zealand has adopted a system of
            market-based bank regulation to try to reduce moral hazard
            and fiscal risk for the government. The system introduces
            new elements of public disclosure and enhanced director
            responsibility. Although the central bank still monitors
            banks, it now uses only publicly disclosed information.
            Judging initial reactions, the author argues that banks find
            the new approach more demanding than the traditional one.
