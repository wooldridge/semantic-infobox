ABSTRACT&#13;
Brazilts urban poverty target group is defined by the World Bank&#13;
by using the concept of relative poverty, in which the poverty line is&#13;
estimated as one third the national per capita income, adjusted for&#13;
urban-rural price differences. It is common in Brazil to transform cur-&#13;
rent cruzeiros into minimum salary units. The minimum salary is also&#13;
determined on a regional basis; currently there are three regional mini-&#13;
mum salaries.&#13;
The Bank has used a national, urban poverty line mea.sured in units&#13;
of the highest regional minimum salary. Recent appraisals of urban&#13;
projects have used three regional minimum salaries for all regions as&#13;
the relative poverty line. In using a single urban poverty line, the&#13;
Bank implicitly assumes that regional differences in the cost of living&#13;
are accurately reflected by the regionally differentiated minimum salaries.&#13;
The basic objective of this paper is to investigate the degree to&#13;
which the use of a single urban poverty threshold in Brazil may lead to&#13;
biased project identification, design, and evaluation. Absolute poverty&#13;
lines are defined by the use of estimates of expenditures for minimum-&#13;
cost, nutritionally adequate diets and food shares of total expenditures&#13;
by families with incomes roughly equivalent to the Bank's relative&#13;
poverty standard. This approach permits estimation of city-specific,&#13;
minimum-diet food costs and poverty lines in 25 cities and analysis of&#13;
these estimates over time, as well as between and within regions.&#13;
The average, per capita cruzeiro cost of the food basket was found&#13;
to be highest in the poorer regions.  Because regional minimum se aries&#13;
are lowest in the poorer regions, this result raises questions about the&#13;
Bankts current standard of using a single relative poverty, line. The&#13;
study concludes that converting the national poverty line expressed in&#13;
cruzeiros to minimum salaries expressed in the regional values would&#13;
decrease the risks of bias in urban project design and appraisal.&#13;

1.   INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF MAIN FINDINGS&#13;
This paper is essentially pragmatic in orientation. It seeks to&#13;
provide a useful tool for contributing to improved indentification,&#13;
design and evaluation of World Bank urban projects in Brazil, specifi-&#13;
cally with regard to determining the extent to which benefits of Bank-&#13;
financed projects will be channeled as directly as possible to the urban&#13;
poverty target group.&#13;
Brazil's urban poverty target group is defined by the Bank through&#13;
the concept of relative poverty, in which the poverty line is estimaced&#13;
as one-third the national per capita income, adjusted for urban-rLu-.l&#13;
price differences. This estimate has been up-dated for 1979 and is&#13;
presented in Annex I.&#13;
It is common in Brazil to transform current cruzeiros into minimum&#13;
salary units. The minimum salary is defined by law in Brazil and is the&#13;
unit of account for.many income statistics. During high inflation&#13;
periods, it may also be useful for inter-temporal comparisons. The&#13;
minimum salary is also determined on a regional basis; currently, there&#13;
are three regional minimum salaries.&#13;
The Bank has used a national, urban poverty line measured in units&#13;
of the highest regional minimum salary. Recent appraisals of urban&#13;
projects have used three regional minimum salaries for all regions as the&#13;
relative poverty line, and Annex I estimates corroborate this indicator&#13;
using the latest available data. In using a single urban poverty line,&#13;
the Bank implicitly assumes that regional differences in the cost of&#13;
living are accurately reflected by the regionally differentiated minimum&#13;
salary.&#13;
The present Bank approach to identifying the urban poor raises the&#13;
question as to possible distorti.ons in treating a family income of three&#13;
regional minimum salaries in, for example, southern cities such as Porto&#13;
Alegre or Curitiba, as essentially equivalent, in terms of welfare&#13;
potential, to three regional minimum salaries in such cities as Sao Luis&#13;
or Recife. Furthermore, there is the question of the comparability of a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
given poverty line between a metropolitan region and a medium-sized city&#13;
of the same minimum salary region. If the regional minimum salaries do&#13;
not accurately reflect regional price differences, the Bank is running&#13;
the risk of allocating scarce resources to people who are not really&#13;
poor, or excluding from its target population groups who are genuinely&#13;
poor.&#13;
The basic objective of this paper is to investigate the degree to&#13;
which the use of a single urban poverty threshold in Brazil may bias&#13;
project identification, design and evaluation. To achieve this objective,&#13;
we estinmate absolute poverty lines defined through the use of estimates&#13;
of expenditures for minimum cost, nutritionally adequate diets and food&#13;
shares of total expenditures by families with incomes roughly equivalent&#13;
to the Bank's relative poverty standard of three minimum salaries.&#13;
Use of the absolute poverty approach permits us to estimate city-&#13;
specific, minimum-diet food costs and poverty lines in twenty-five&#13;
cities and to analyze our estimates over time, as well as between and&#13;
within regions. It also permits an evaluation of the Bank's single,&#13;
urban relative urban poverty line. Our estimates of absolute poverty&#13;
lines are presented in Chapter 4, and comparisons with the Bank's rela-&#13;
tive standard are made in Chapter 5. The main findings and recommenda-&#13;
tions of this study are summarized below.&#13;
a.   Although there appears to be no acceptable alternative to the&#13;
use of the minimum salary as a unit of account for many income&#13;
data, interpretation of data expressed in minimum salary units&#13;
presents several difficulties. One difficulty is that the&#13;
number of regional minimum salaries has been decreasing, and&#13;
there is a trend for the regional minimum salaries to converge&#13;
to the highest value. Another is that, at least in those&#13;
cities where cost of living indices exist, the constant cruzeiro&#13;
value of the minimum salary has been generally increasing&#13;
since 1970, but at uneven rates, and there are cases of annual&#13;
decreases.&#13;
b.   The relative prices of each element of the minimum cost,&#13;
ntutritionally adequate food basket were not stable over the&#13;
1974/75 to 1980 period. However, a "staple" portion of the&#13;
basket, defined as five items selected on the basis of their&#13;
weights in the basket's cost, did demonstrate relative price&#13;
stability over the period. Prediction of the 1980 basket cost&#13;
with data on the cost of the staple items in 1980 and the&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
percent of total baskeL cost going to the staple items in&#13;
1974/75 produced results which were, on the average, only 6%&#13;
higher than the 1980 observed, total basket cost.&#13;
c.   The average, per capita cruzeiro cost of the food basket was&#13;
Aighest in the poorer regions. Because regional minimum&#13;
salaries are lowest in the poorer regions, this result makes&#13;
questionable the Bank's current standard of using a single&#13;
relative poverty line expressed as three regional minimum&#13;
salaries, based on the assumption that the regional minimum&#13;
salaries accurately reflect regional cost of living differences.&#13;
d.   The Bank's current policy is examined through comparison with&#13;
the absolute poverty line estimates and with an alternative&#13;
way of expressing the national, relative poverty line in units&#13;
of regional minimum salaries. We conclude that converting the&#13;
national poverty line expressed in cruzeiros to minimum salaries&#13;
expressed in the regional values would decrease the risks of&#13;
bias in urban project design and appraisal. Specifically, we&#13;
recommend that the Bank substitute the standard of three&#13;
regional minimum salariestin all cities with three minimum&#13;
salaries in the cities of the Central South, South and Brasilia,&#13;
and four regional minimum salaries in the cities of the North,&#13;
Northeast, Cuiaba and Goiania.&#13;
e.   Our methodology for estimating city-specific absolute poverty&#13;
lines is relatively robust and permits easy interpretation.&#13;
Its data requirements are not excessive, and it could be&#13;
reproduced, with suitable adaptations, in other middle-income&#13;
countries in which the Bank uses the relative poverty criterion&#13;
and which present regional diversities similar to those in&#13;
Brazil.&#13;
It is hoped that the results of this study will be useful in:&#13;
-mproving urban project identification and design through more effective&#13;
targeting on the urban poor; improving the evaluation of the urban&#13;
poverty impact of Bank-financed projects; and reducing the costs of&#13;
collecting and using data on urban poverty.&#13;
As with all efforts, this study is influenced by constraints. Our&#13;
data are limited to secondary sources and include no field research. We&#13;
try to make as explicit and clear as possible the sources and limitations&#13;
of our information, seeking to faciliate future reproductions and/or&#13;
adjustments which the Bank may wish to undertake. Finally, it should be&#13;
made clear that our efforts are limited here to identifying the urban&#13;
poor; analysis of the causes of poverty are beyond the scope of this&#13;
undertaking.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2,   GENERZAL METHODOLOGICAL CONSlDERATIONS&#13;
2.1. Overview&#13;
The methodology used seeks to estimate absolute poverty lines in&#13;
Brazilian cities. To be useful in comparison with the World Bank's&#13;
relative poverty line estimates, our absolute poverty line estimates&#13;
should be developed so as to permit comparisons over time and between&#13;
cities. These objectives obviously impose more rigorous data require-&#13;
ments than a single, national poverty line. Our major sources of data&#13;
are discussed in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 of this Chapter.&#13;
A substantial debate has developed in the literature regarding the&#13;
use of relative versus absolute poverty measures.-/ Our purpose here is&#13;
not to directly contribute to this debate; we simply seek to evaluate&#13;
the use of a single, national, relative poverty line through the use of&#13;
absolute poverty measures which may be estimated through time and over&#13;
space.&#13;
Given the objectives and constraints of the present study, Vinod&#13;
Thomas has presented a particularly useful approach_-/ which has the&#13;
additional advantage of already being extended to Brazil.-/&#13;
Although Thomas' methodology does not have exactly the same focus&#13;
as our study (his is not limited to urban poverty), he is, as we are,&#13;
centrally concerned with the spatial variable in measuring poverty, and&#13;
the data requirements of his methodology are compatible with our constraints.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The essential steps of Thomas' methodology may be summarized as follows:&#13;
(M)     Definition of a single basket relevant to the low&#13;
income population (lower twentieth percentile of the&#13;
income range) of a base region (Peru's Rural Sierra&#13;
Region), adjusted to meet given nutritional requirements&#13;
(Peru's National Planning Institute).&#13;
(ii)     Considering total expenditures as limited to two basic&#13;
categories, food and non-food, the prices of the food&#13;
categories in the food basket were converted into re-&#13;
gional relative prices, weighted according to the impor-&#13;
tance of each category in the national average budget.&#13;
Similarly, a regional non-food price index was cor tructed.&#13;
In this way, each region's food and non-food price indices&#13;
coUld be compared to the base region, Rural Sierra.&#13;
(iii)     Considering the food basket defined in (i) as the minimum&#13;
requirement at the poverty line,, measurement of the&#13;
minimum food basket costs and non-food costs in Rural&#13;
Sierra permitted the estimation of poverty line expendi-&#13;
tures in the other regions through the use of inter-&#13;
regional food and non-food price indices, as developed in&#13;
(ii).&#13;
Our methodology essentially follows the same steps as that of&#13;
Thomas, with the adjustments necessary to take into account differences&#13;
in study scope and the data available in Peru and Brazil. It may be&#13;
broadly described as follows:&#13;
(i)     Definition of a single family food basket relevant to the&#13;
low income population (public, low-cost housing projects)&#13;
of a base urban area (Rio de Janeiro), adjusted to meet&#13;
given nutritional standards (Getulio Vargas Foundation's&#13;
interpretation of FAO/WHO standards for the surveyed&#13;
population) - described in Chapter 3 and Annex II of this&#13;
paper.&#13;
(ii)     Of the 25 Braziliani cities included in our survey, IBGE's -/&#13;
National Household Expenditure Survey - ENDEF conducted&#13;
August 1974-August 1975, provides directly the food share&#13;
(s) of total, low-income family expenditures in 10 of the&#13;
cities, and the s of the remaining cities could be inferred&#13;
on a regional basis. In addition, we have direct informa-&#13;
tion from IBGE's National Price Survey (Inquerito&#13;

cities for the period 1974-80, of each of the conmodities&#13;
of the basic food basket. Thus, it was not necessary to&#13;
estimate regional price indices for food and non-food&#13;
expenditures, as Thomas did.&#13;
(iii)     Considering the family food basket defined in (i) as&#13;
the minimum requirement at the poverty line, family&#13;
poverty line expenditures for each city are estimated for&#13;
1974/75 and 1980 by dividing the expenditures necessary&#13;
to purchase the weighted food elements of the basket by&#13;
the food share (s) of total expenditures, as presented in&#13;
Chapter 4.&#13;
We readily recognize that our approach to measuring absolute poverty&#13;
lines contains arbitrarities and ambiguities. It is important, therefore,&#13;
to examine the characteristics, both weak and strong points, of our&#13;
methodology.&#13;
Disaggregation of total expenditures into only two groups, food and&#13;
non-food may be considered "heroic". It is desirable to disaggregate&#13;
non-food consumption items in other components which could be considered&#13;
to be vital to individual and family welfare, such as shelter, water and&#13;
sanitary facilities, clothing, health services and access to employment&#13;
and other. urban opportunities. Thomas recognizes-the desirability of&#13;
incorporating such components explicitly in the analysis but states that&#13;
the Peruvian data do not permit this. 5/ In the case of Brazil, it may&#13;
be possible to develop detailed family consumption structures for the&#13;
metropolitan regions. These structures are potentially available in the&#13;
ENDEF. Access to them requires, however, official permission and special&#13;
computer tabulations, which would require time and costs beyond the&#13;
scope of this study.&#13;
Even if many would argue that adequate food consumption is not&#13;
sufficient,, few would disagree that nutrition levels are necessary to&#13;
the analysis of a poverty line. There appear to be few, if any, signi-&#13;
ficant exceptions to Engels' observation that the proportion of total&#13;
expenditures allocated to food tends to decline with increasing levels&#13;
of expenditures.&#13;
-/Thomas-Peru, p. 87.&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Increasing food proportions, s, with lower incomes, raises another&#13;
question regarding our methodology. We are placed in the uncomfortable&#13;
position, in using a city-specific s, of stating that tne poorer the&#13;
family (higher s) the less the family needs to meet the poverty line.&#13;
While there may be a wide consensus that a high proportion of total&#13;
family expenditures necessary to attain a nutritionally adequate diet&#13;
(say, over 70%), certainly is an indicator that the family lives in&#13;
absolute poverty, dividing the food expenditure amount by s to obtain&#13;
the poverty line, as we do, implies that, for a given food expenditure,&#13;
the greater the s, the lower the poverty line.&#13;
Perhaps for most of the poorest part of Brazil, especially the&#13;
Northeast, physical shelter unit quality and clothing may not be essential&#13;
to physical survival, because of the generally temperate climate.&#13;
Nevertheless, a high s for the poorest areas may mean that the poorest&#13;
families need to allocate so much of their income to nutritional survival&#13;
that the opportunity cost in terms of other important goods and services,&#13;
particularly health and sanitation services and transportation to job&#13;
opportunities, may be very high. In other words, a poverty line based&#13;
on a city-specific s may indicate an income necessary for survival, but&#13;
it could seriousiy underestimate the income level necessary to move out&#13;
of poverty.&#13;
In raising these questions about the use of s, we recognize that it&#13;
may be a potentially weak point in our methodology. Chapter 4 presents&#13;
further analysis of this consideration. This may not be a serious&#13;
problem from the Bank's perspective, however, as long as the poverty&#13;
lines presented are understood to explicitly consider only minimum&#13;
nutrition standards. Thus, one way to interpret the Bank's role is that&#13;
of helping diminish the high opportunity costs of nutrition in terms of&#13;
shelter, water, sanitation, transport and other services through urban&#13;
projects.&#13;
Another question regarding our methodology is the use of only one&#13;
nutritionally adequate food basket for all cities and for both periods.&#13;
Some may argue that nutritional requirements are subject to "adaptive&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Yneclianisins" -over time.  Although recognizing the probleins of an uncriti-&#13;
cal use of the "nutritional approach", Sen argues that:&#13;
"It is possible to overlook a simple point, to wit, mal-&#13;
nutrition can provide a basis for a standard of poverty&#13;
without poverty being identified as the extent of mal-&#13;
nourishment. The level of income at which an average per-&#13;
son will be able to meet his nutritional requirements has&#13;
a claim to being considered as an appropriate poverty line&#13;
even when it is explicitely recognized that nutritional&#13;
requirements vary interpersonally around the average."&#13;
A more serious question regarding the use of a single nutritionally&#13;
adequate food basket is that it does not incorporate intercity consump-&#13;
tion preferences or commodity substitution as the result of relative&#13;
price changes. 7/ In the case of preferences, these could be regionally&#13;
adjusted for 1974/75 through detailed examination of unpublished ENDEF&#13;
data, but this would require special tabulations beyond this study's&#13;
scope.  As for substitutions because of relative price changes, this is&#13;
a common index problem, and there is no easy solution. It is similar to&#13;
the Consumer Price Index problem: the Paasche Index may be considered&#13;
superior to that of Laspeyres, but the latter is usually preferred&#13;
because of cost and operational constraints. Our use of a single basket&#13;
for all the cities over the study period assumes that neither consump-&#13;
tion preferences vary significantly over space, nor that relative prices&#13;
have changed significantly over time. These assumptions will be examined&#13;
as part of the analysis presented in Chapter 4.&#13;
Although the questions raised here, and perhaps others, are signi-&#13;
ficant and should be carefully considered in interpreting our results,&#13;
the proposed methodology has a number of characteristics which recommend&#13;
it. First, it is relatively simple, and data demands are not excessive.&#13;
Once the food basket and s are established, poverty calculations are&#13;

-/The food shares calculated from the 1974/75 ENDEF and the commodity&#13;
weights calculated from the 1973 Getulio Vargas Foundation survey (see&#13;
Chapter 3) were assumed to be constant over the 1974-80 period. More&#13;
recent estimates are not available.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
simple and several sensitivity tests may be performed with relatively&#13;
easy interpretations.' This facilitates reproduction (new studies in&#13;
other middle-income countries and up-dates in Brazil) aind comparison&#13;
(with other countries or later periods in Brazil).&#13;
Second, particularly in Brazil, where systematic, local commodity&#13;
prices to the consumer are available..over time, the methodology permits&#13;
a relatively high degree of rigor in city-specific costing of the mini-&#13;
mum food basket, as well as the evaluation of some of the potentially&#13;
negative aspects of the methodology, as raised earlier, over time.&#13;
Finally, given that the methodology is relatively simple and robust,&#13;
it permits (see Chapter 4) quickly obtained instrumental, or "short-&#13;
cut", estimates of the poverty line in a city not covered in the survey&#13;
(or a surveyed city at a later date) through readily available data at a&#13;
low cost.&#13;
2.2 The Unit of Analysis&#13;
Although a large proportion of the studies of income distribution&#13;
done in Brazil to date has concentrated on the individual (economically&#13;
active population), there seems to be a broad consensus in the litera-&#13;
ture that for the study of poverty the family or household unit is the&#13;
most adequate unit of analysis. Since most people live in family groups,&#13;
what defines poverty is the income available to be shared among family&#13;
members. As Kuznets has put it, "in a meaningful distribution of income&#13;
by size, the recipient unit has to be the family or household and cannot&#13;
be a person." 81&#13;
The use of the family or household as the unit of analysis raises&#13;
the question of whether total or per capita measures of family or house-&#13;
hold income should be used.   Musgrove -  argues forcef'ully in favor of the&#13;
8/&#13;

Income. An Exploratory Essay", Economic Development and Cultural Change,&#13;
Vol. 25 (October 1975) p.l.&#13;

Poverty in Urban Latin America", Economic Development and Cultural Change,&#13;

9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
per capita measure simply because "the variation in family size among&#13;
households is much too great to be ignored when describing income dis-&#13;
tribution."&#13;
For the present study, we shall use the family as the basic unit of&#13;
analysis.  For each city in our survey, we estimate the poverty line for&#13;
a family of average (mean) size for a broader view of poverty within&#13;
that city. In addition, the per capita family poverty line income is&#13;
estimated, in order to permit the analysis of the distribution of family&#13;
sizes on the poverty line. We draw our definition of the fJamily from&#13;
ENDEF, considering the base for family definition as the "budget unit&#13;
expenditures". Thus, the family unit is considered on the basis of a&#13;
common dwelling unit and a unified income and expenditure budget, -&#13;
2.3 The Instruments of Measurement&#13;
In estimating the absolute poverty line for each of the 25 Brazilian&#13;
cities we relied on four major sources of data: regional minimum salaries;&#13;
ENDEF; the National Price Survey; and the Getulio Vargas Foundation.&#13;
Below, an, overview of these sources is presented, including their relatively&#13;
strong and weak points.&#13;
2.3.1 Regional Minimum Salaries&#13;
The minimum salary in Brazil is defined periodically by law.&#13;
Historically, the minimum salary has changed each year on May 1st, but&#13;
since 1979, there are two changes per year, May and November. These&#13;
changes are supposed to reflect changes in the cost of living, but the&#13;
actutal methodology for calculation is not made public.&#13;
For this study, the minimum salary is most important as a unit of&#13;
account. Not only are most low-income urban workers directly affected&#13;
by its value, a great deal of published data regarding income distribution&#13;
is presented in minimum salary intervals. Also, given the high rates of&#13;

see Paulo T.A. de Andre, "The Brazil 1974/75 National Household Expenditure&#13;
Survey", Conducting Surveys in Developing Countries:   Practical Problems&#13;
and Experiences in Brazil, Malaysia and the Philippines (Washington,&#13;
D.C.: The World Bank Living Standards Measurement Study Working Paper&#13;
No. 5), pp. 24-43.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
inflation in Brazil, transforming income or expenditures in minimum&#13;
salary units is important in interpreting intertemporal and regional&#13;
trends.&#13;
The poverty lines in 25 cities at two points in time are presented&#13;
in Chapter 4, and much of their interpretation depends cn our under-&#13;
standing of the minimum salary. Our poverty lines are based on the&#13;
incomes at the beginning of the periods covered by our survey of the&#13;
costs of the minimum food basket. This is based on the assumption that,&#13;
for most of the target group, incomes were relatively constant over the&#13;
minimum salary period. With high inflation over the period, however,&#13;
the buying power of incomes tended to decrease.&#13;
Our temporal base is for the period of the ENDEF study, August 1974&#13;
to August 1975. Therefore, the most relevant minimum salary period is&#13;
from May 1, 1974 to April 30, 1975. We also calculate the poverty lines&#13;
in 1980. In that year, however, the minimum salary changed twice, on&#13;
May 1st and November 1st.   We have used the May 1st 1980 mimimum salary&#13;
as our unit of account.&#13;
Although it is very difficult, if not impossible for all but the&#13;
few who actually make the decisions regarding mirimum salary changes, to&#13;
examine the change criteria, certain tendancies over time may be noted.&#13;
First, there has been a recent reduction in the concentration of wage&#13;
earners at the one minimum salary level. In 1970, 60.6% of the econo-&#13;
mically active population earned one minimum salary or less and 82.3%&#13;
two or less; in 1976 these figures were, respectively 37.4% and 66.8%.ll/&#13;
Table 1 demonstrates another tendency, of a dramatic loss of rela-&#13;
tive buying power of the minimum salary during the 1960's, and relative&#13;
stability (although at a lower level than the early 1960's) since 1975.&#13;
However, it is important to note that 1974 presented a significant&#13;
decrease, especially since the 1974 minimum salary is the base point for&#13;
our study.&#13;

Table 2 presents the 1974 and 1980 minimum salaries used in this&#13;
study, as well as indices of change in the regional minimum salaries&#13;
over time,. for each of the cities in our survey. Two important trends&#13;
are clear. First, the degree of "fine-tuning" for the minimum salary&#13;
has greatly decreased: from 14 different values in 1960, 1974 presented&#13;
5 and 1980 only 3. This is an indication that there may be one national&#13;
minimum salary in the near future. Another trend has been decreased&#13;
dispersion from the highest minimum salary. In 1960, the lowest minimum&#13;
salary (Teresina) was 42% of the highest (Rio de Janeiro); in 1970 the&#13;
difference decreased to 67% and in 1980 to 77%.    If the cost of living&#13;
in those cities with minimum salaries lower than the highest has been&#13;
increasing at about the same rates as Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, then&#13;
a comparison of the data of Tables 1 and 2 indicates that the lower&#13;
minimum salaries have been increasing faster than the cost of living in&#13;
those cities.&#13;
2.3.2     National Household Expenditure Survey - ENDEF&#13;
Another important source of data is the ENDEF, which presents&#13;
detailed family expeuiditure data. After a careful review of income&#13;
sources in Brazil, Pfeffermann and Webb conclude that ENDEF "provides&#13;
the most reliable basis for statements about the structure of income.&#13;
Expenditure surveys usually achieve better coverage of total income than&#13;
employment surveys and this was the case with ENDEF. 12/&#13;
ENDEF is particularly important for this study in that it provides&#13;
us with key variables, especially the food expenditure share (s) of&#13;
total family expenditures and average family size. In some cases,&#13;
however, ENDEF aggregates our sample cities in larger urban units,&#13;
because ENDEF provides urban information by 15 urban regions. In those&#13;
cases, we consider family size and the food share as equal in each of&#13;
the cities of the ENDEF urban region. This occurs in the following&#13;

In additiorn to the aggregated data for the 13 cities above, ENDEF&#13;
provides separate family size and food share data for each of the nine,&#13;
metropolitan regions and Brasilia (including not only the Plano Piloto,&#13;
but also the "satellite cities"). Vitoria and Florianopolis are the&#13;
only surveyed cities of other ENDEF regions (regions 8 and 11 respecti-&#13;
vely). Annex III presents the ENDEF regions.&#13;
In estimating the food share (s) of total family expenditures, we&#13;
used the ENDEF annual family income interval of Cr$ 9,000 to Cr$ 15,799&#13;
for August 1974 income levels. In May 1974 minimum salary terms, this&#13;
interval corresponded to 2.0 to 3.5 MS in the Southeast (except Vitoria),&#13;
2.1 to 3.8 for the South, 2.5 to 4.5 for the Center West and Amazon and&#13;
2.8 to 4.9 for most of the Northeast, except Recife and Salvador, which&#13;
had Center-West levels. This is the onlv interval consistent with the&#13;
Bank's standard of 3 minimum salaries. Thus, each s and each absolute&#13;
poverty line are estimated from a base strata roughly comparable to the&#13;
Bank's relative poverty standard.&#13;
ENDEF also calculated non-monetar!r income. In the case of urban&#13;
areas, the most important source of non-monetary income is imputed&#13;
rents. In order to examine the impact of excluding this component from&#13;
total family income, we perform a sensitivity test (Annex IV) excluding&#13;
imputed rents from total income. This, of course, changes the s values.&#13;
2.3.3.    National Price Survey - INP&#13;
Our source of data for costing the minimum diet food basket in&#13;
the 25 cities is the National PLrice Survey (INP). 13-  In this survey,&#13;
Ai/IBGE, Inquerito Nacional de Precos:  Generos AlimentL,cios, with&#13;
irregular publication periods.&#13;
15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
over 50      food item prices are collected monthly in retail establish-&#13;
ments of the urban areas of the capital Municipality of each State and&#13;
Territory.&#13;
For 1974/75, INP data for the third and fourth quarters of 1974 and&#13;
first and second quarters of 1975 were used. For this period, therefore,&#13;
food price data are for July 1974 to June 1975, ENDEF information for&#13;
August 1974 to August 1975, and the minimum salary applies to May 1974&#13;
to April 1975. Some small distortions may be introduced by not having&#13;
the time periods for each data source precisely consistent, but this is&#13;
the best approximation possible with the available data.&#13;
For the 1980 period, the food price data correspond to the same&#13;
period as the validity of the minimum salary, May 1980 through October&#13;
1980.&#13;
In both periods, the quality of the food price data may be considered&#13;
good. In each period, a food price matrix was developed with 25 cities&#13;
and 22 commodities (see Chapter 3). In 1974/75, 13 of the 550 matrix&#13;
cells presented the problems of product' prices not being available in&#13;
some cities. Seven of the "problem cells" were caused by the prices of&#13;
the specific type of rice of our survey (arroz japones) not being avail-&#13;
able, and they were substituted by another type of rice (arroz agulha).&#13;
Other cases involved substitution of another type of bean or taking the&#13;
relevant price from the closest city with best information. In 1980,&#13;
ce ls15/&#13;
there were only six "problem cells" -    and in general we conclude that&#13;
the city-specific food, price data are of good quality.&#13;
2.3.4.    Getulio Vargas Foundation&#13;
Our final major source of data is the Getulio Vargas Founda-&#13;
tion's study of minimum cost diets for low-income families. Considering&#13;
- /The number of food items has varied. For example, in 1974, 56&#13;
items were collected; in 1979, there were 59.&#13;
5-/Type of bean substitution for 2 months in Rio; 2nd class meat&#13;
and chicken prices for Goiania were inferred from Campo Grande; dry&#13;
meat, egg and milk prices for Boa Vista were inferred from the mean&#13;
prices observed in Porto Velho, Rio Branco, Manaus and Cuiaba.&#13;
16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
that the commodity weights of the food basket are one of the most&#13;
critical elements of our methodology, these are discussed in the next&#13;
chapter, with details presented in Annex II.&#13;

3.   DEFINITION OF TllE POVERTY LINE FOOD BASKET&#13;
Definition of the poverty line food basket for this study is based&#13;
on the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV) nutrition study -/ conducted in&#13;
October - December 1973. A sample of 235 families living in public&#13;
housing (COHAB) apartments was examined in detail as to its physical,&#13;
socioeconomic and nutritional characteristics. 2/&#13;
The study's definitions of family unit, income and expenditures are&#13;
consistent with the later ENDEF (see FGV-Pesquisa, p. 14 and p. 86).&#13;
The mean family income of the sample was 3.4 minimum salaries, with an&#13;
average family size of 4.9 and a family per capita income of 0.69 MS.&#13;
The frequency distribution of the families by income intervals indicates,&#13;
however, that about 65% of the families had incomes of less than 3.5 MS,&#13;
and the income interval of the median value had a mean of 3.1 MS. Only&#13;
4 families had incomes greater than 8 MS, with 18 MS the upper-bound of&#13;
the last interval (FGV-Pesquisa, Table 5.1, p. 87).&#13;
This sample appears to be compatible with the type of population&#13;
the Bank generally is involved with in urban projects and is essentially&#13;
consistent with the relative poverty criterion currently in use on a&#13;
national basis. This enables us to use the general findings in developing&#13;
a relevant food basket which can be analyzed across cities over time.&#13;
Based on FAO/WHO nutritional standards interp.reted for the character-&#13;
istics of the sampled population, the nutritional quality of observed&#13;
diets is presented in Table 3.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
It should be noted that the FGV interpretation of FAO/WH0O nutri-&#13;
tional requirements produced results somewhat lower than other published&#13;
figures. For example, the World Bank's Brazil: Human Resources Special&#13;
Report uses the FAO/WHO "low" requirement for per capita daily calorie&#13;
3/&#13;
consumption of 2,261 as a standard of comparison. -     &amp;he major reason&#13;
for this discrepancy seems to be that the FGV reduced the FAO/WHO&#13;
standard for cal!Dries by 8.85% for a climate adjustment, and this directly&#13;
affected the thiamine, riboflavin and niacin requirements, which were&#13;
41.&#13;
set as proportional to calories, for each age, sex and weight group. -&#13;
The average per capita daily calorie requirements of the ENDEF for&#13;
urban Brazil were set at 2,007 ranging from 1,807 in the Northeast to&#13;
2,086 in the urban South and Southeast regions. The FAO/WHO low require-&#13;
ment is 2,261 for average urban, with 2,150 for urban Northeast and&#13;
2,299 for urban South and Southeast.    - In comparing the observed&#13;
calorie consumption of the FGV sample with the FAO/WHO standard, the&#13;
sampled population had an individual calorie deficit of 443 per day.&#13;
This deficit places the sampled population, according to the Bank's&#13;
Human Resources report for Brazil, in the lowest calorie consumption&#13;
category (deficits over 400 calories), which is estimated to include&#13;
21.9% of Brazil's total urban population, ranging from 48.7% in the&#13;
urban Northeast and 12.3% in the urban South and Southeast. The remainder&#13;
of the urban population is estimated to have an adequate diet (23.5%&#13;
urban Brazil, 29.6% South and Southeast and 8,5% Northeast) or individual&#13;
deficits of less than 400 per day. 6/&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
The FGV nutritional standards and sample population are very important&#13;
to the present study. On them, we built our empirical base for estimating&#13;
the poverty lines. In evaluating the FGV data, we observe that, from a&#13;
nutritional perspective, the sampled population meets most definitions&#13;
of urban poverty. In addition to presenting absolute nutritional deficits,&#13;
even with low FGV requirements, some 78% of Brazilts urban population&#13;
are estimated to have better diets than the sampled population, and 88%&#13;
of the region's urban population are in. a superior position; translating&#13;
the Bank's income definition of relative poverty into nutritional terms&#13;
would surely classify the sampled population as poor. In using the FGV&#13;
diet standards we tend to introduce a conservative bias in our estimates&#13;
of the poverty line; if higher nutrition requirements were used, the&#13;
food basket would be more expensive and the poverty line higher.&#13;
The FGV sample identified 80 food products consumed by the sampled&#13;
families. These products formed the universe for the FGV linear programming&#13;
model. Basic inputs were the nutritional qualities and market prices of&#13;
each product, as well as the family nutritional requirements. The first&#13;
minimum cost solution, with only nutritional requirement constraints,&#13;
produced a diet of only 9 products at a monthly cost of Cr$ 374.79 at&#13;
1975 average prices. It is unlikely, however, that any family could&#13;
sustain such a constrained diet for very long. Its main elements are&#13;
33.9 kilos/month of wheat flour and 14.6 of manioc (cassava) flourr and&#13;
it provides no coffee or condiments. -&#13;
Another diet (titled diet "H" by the FGV) results from the introduction&#13;
of a number of "palpability" constraints, which forced the int.roduction&#13;
of widely consumed elements, such as coffee, salt and pepper, and limited&#13;
the amounts of such foods as wheat and manioc flour. This produced a&#13;
more reasonable diet, in the sense of better approximating the actual&#13;
habits of urban consumers at, however, a higher least cost, Cr$ 517.22.&#13;
This is the diet we selected to form the base of the nutritionally&#13;
adequate, least cost diet, as presented in Table 4.&#13;
7/Other elements of this diet are black beans (7.8 kg/month), brown&#13;
beans (3.1), liver (3.1), dry meat (5.0), fresh milk (13.1), soybean oil&#13;
(5.8), and kale (0.8).&#13;

The next step was to compare the components of Table 4 with the&#13;
city-specific food prices of the INP. Of the 26 food items, the INP&#13;
only publishes 22.  The missing items (kale, liver, sardines and pepper)&#13;
were substituted through examination of the tables -/ of the nutritional&#13;
quality of each product and manual iteration. The substitutions did not&#13;
substantially modify the nutritional quality of the diet and, in fact,&#13;
slightly reduced its cost, to Cr$ 515.50. A more detailed description&#13;
of the substitution methodology is presented in Annex II.&#13;
The food component quantities as used in calculating the poverty&#13;
lines are presented in Table 5. We consider this the minimum diet for&#13;
the FGV typical family (4.72 adult equivalents). - Its 1975 average&#13;
cost is Cr$ 515.50. Actual food expenditures of the surveyed families&#13;
were Cr$ 604.70 in 1975 prices, about 20% higher. As a sensitivity test&#13;
in Annex IV, we multiply the minimum diet by 1.2 for comparison with&#13;
whiat may be called a "behavioral diet."&#13;

-To simplify calculations, we opted for the "head count" metho-&#13;
dology rather than adult equivalents. Thus, in calculating poverty&#13;
lines, we used the quantities of Table 5 as applying to a family of 5.&#13;
An evaluation of the impact of this adjustment is presented in Annex II.&#13;

4.   ESTIMATES AND ANALYSIS OF THE ABSOLUTE POVERTY LINES&#13;
This chapter is limited to presentation and analysis of the absolute&#13;
poverty lines in the 25 surveyed cities. Comparison of these findings&#13;
with the World Bank's relative poverty lines is presented in the following&#13;
chapter.&#13;
Section 4.1 simply presents the absolute estimates. Sections 4.2-&#13;
4.4 analyze the estimates from intertemporal, city size and regional&#13;
perspectives.&#13;
4.1 Absolute Poverty Line Estimates Based on Minimum Diet Costs&#13;
Tables 6 and 7 present estimates of absolute poverty lines in the&#13;
25 surveyed cities. The estimates are based on the cost of the minimum&#13;
cost, nutritionally adequate diet, the food share of total family expen-&#13;
ditures, and average family size in each city.&#13;
Interpretation of the estimates presented in Tables 6 and 7 should&#13;
be guided by the following summary of the characteristics of the methodol-&#13;
ogy used.&#13;
(i) Per capita costs of the minimum diet in 1974-75 and 1980&#13;
(Columns 1 and 2 of Table 6) may be considered to be the least&#13;
biased of the poverty indicators, in that they are derived&#13;
directly from field observation and are not influenced by&#13;
subsequent steps of the methodology. The 1974-75 figures&#13;
should be very close to reality if the food basket quantities&#13;
(Table 5) derived from Rio de Janeiro data are valid across&#13;
the regions. The 1980 figures may be less accurate, given&#13;
that the basket quantities are constant for both periods and&#13;
thus do not incorporate changes in consumption behavior which&#13;
may have occurred over the period because of changes in&#13;
relative food prices. This question is addressed in the&#13;
following section.&#13;
(ii) The food share (s) is considered constant for both estimate&#13;
periods. This assumes that preferences and relative food and&#13;
non-food prices have not changed significaAtly over the period.&#13;
(iii)  Average family size was calculated.from ENDEF data (as was s)&#13;
and corresponds to the 1974/75 peUiod, although in some cases&#13;
a sample city's average family size had to be taken from&#13;
aggregated, regionalized ENDEF data (see Section 2.3 - this&#13;
aggregation also applied to s data). Some implications of&#13;

4.2  Intertemporal Changes in the Poverty Line&#13;
One of the most striking results presented in Table 7 is the significant&#13;
decrease in the absolute poverty line estimates over time. With only.&#13;
one exception (Belo Horizonte), the estimates expressed in terms of&#13;
regional minimum salaries (Cols. 6 and 7) decreased substantially from&#13;
the 1974/75 period to 1980. In general, the estimates decreased less&#13;
sharply in the metropolitan regions of the South and Central South than&#13;
in other cities.&#13;
Considering that the absolute poverty line estimates are based on a&#13;
given food basket, one possible explanation of this decrease is that the&#13;
food basket cost has increased at a rate lower than that of the minimum&#13;
salaries. Although changes in regional minimum salaries have not necessarily&#13;
been directly proportional to changes in the cost of living, the FGV&#13;
General Price Index-!/ indicates that the cost of living in Rio de&#13;
Janeiro has increased by'a factor of 11.4 at current prices from August&#13;
.1974 to August 1980. Comparison of this change with Col. 3 of Table 6&#13;
lends some support to the hypothesis that food prices have been increasing&#13;
at a lower rate than general prices. This is a question which remains&#13;
open, however, given our limitation of having available only one food&#13;
basket for both periods and for all cities. -/&#13;
-/From FGV, "Indices Economicos - Suplemento Especial," Conjuntura&#13;
Economica, Vol. 33, No. 11, p. 10 - ''Coluna 2."&#13;
-'Analysis of variance of the price of each food item of our basket&#13;
by aggregated PNAD regions was done. The sampled cities were aggregated&#13;
by the following regions: Center-South, South, Northeast, Brasilia, and&#13;
North and Center-West. In 1980, ten of the items showed significant&#13;
(pO.05)price differences between regions.    These items are sugar,&#13;
potatoes, onions, wheat flour, chicken, margarine, soybean oil, eggs,&#13;
salt and tomatoes. In 1974, 16 items showed significant regional price&#13;
differences. In addition to the 1980 items, coffee, manioc flour, brown&#13;
and black beans, milk and bread showed significant price changes. This&#13;
is rather weak evidence that diets may be becoming less varied between&#13;
regions over time.&#13;
28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Relative changes in the regional minimum salaries, as discussed in&#13;
Section 2.3, suggest that the decrease in the estimates from 1974/75 to&#13;
1980 may be more apparent than real. From Table 1, it should be noted&#13;
*that 1974 presented the only significant, annual decrease since 1970 in&#13;
minimum salaries expressed in constant; 1970 prices. In Rio de Janeiro,&#13;
for example, the 1974 value was Cr$ 178.08, as compared to Cr$ 188.89 in&#13;
1973 and Cr$ 190.09 in 1975. The minimum salary unit of account for the&#13;
1974 base period may thus be considered "artificially" low. This would&#13;
make the poverty line estimates "artifically" high.in that period.&#13;
From Table 1, it may also be observed that, in the three cities&#13;
where cost of living deflators exist, the real value of the minimum&#13;
salary increased from 1974 to 1980. Deflating the 1974 family poverty&#13;
lines (Col. 6 of Table 7) by the 1974/78 differences in real minimum&#13;
salary values (Table 1) gives an estimate of the 1974 poverty lines&#13;
adjusted to reflect the real value of more recent minimum salaries. For&#13;
example, in the case of Rio de Janeiro, the adjustment is made as follows:&#13;
(178.08/191.93)* 2.3 = 2.1. These adjustments give an idea of the 1974&#13;
poverty lines in 1980 minimum salaries and are summarized below:&#13;
1974 PL in          1974 PL in          1980 PL in&#13;
current RMS-1974.    "adjusted" RMS        current RMS&#13;
Rio de Janeiro         2.3                2.1                  2.0&#13;
Sao Paulo              2.8                2.4                  2.6&#13;
Porto Alegre           2.4                2.1                  1.9&#13;
It is also important to note that the minimum salary period changed&#13;
from 1974/75 to 1980. In the former case, the minimum salary applied&#13;
from May 1, 1974 to April 30, 1975. In 1980, the period was reduced to&#13;
six months, from May 1, 1980 to October 31, 1980. Thus, the estimates&#13;
are based in 1974/75 on division of the average food basket costs over&#13;
the year period by the minimum salary at the beginning of the period.&#13;
In 1980, the average food basket cost over six months was divded by the&#13;
minimum salary 'at the beginning of the period. Although inflation in&#13;
1980 was higher than in 1974/75, it seems unlikely that food prices&#13;
increased in six months as much as the 1974/75 year period.&#13;
29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Another tendency noted (Table 2) is for the regional minimum salaries&#13;
to "converge" toward the highest regional figure. Columns 8 and 9 of&#13;
Table 7 show the impact of this tendency, with the poverty lines expressed&#13;
in units of the highest regional minimum salary of each period.&#13;
Although the available data often impose the use of the minimum&#13;
salary as a unit of account, the changes it has demonstrated often make&#13;
difficult interpretation of results. This suggests that periodic up-&#13;
dating of absolute, city-specific poverty line el;timates would be wise,&#13;
especially if more recent food basket weights and shares are developed.&#13;
One of the assumptions on which the 1980 estimates are based is&#13;
that relative food prices have not significantly changed from 1974/75 to&#13;
1980. This assumption was investigated through the use of linear regression&#13;
models, with the per capita poverty line estimates in 1974/75 and 1980&#13;
current cruzeiros (Columns 2.and 3 of Table 7) as the dependent variables.&#13;
The independent variables for each city were: median global family&#13;
expenditures in 1974 (which are negatively correlated with the s values);&#13;
population in-l975; population in 1980; and the food prices of the&#13;
minimum diet basket (see Table 5).&#13;
The most relevant results of the regression analysis are presented&#13;
in Table 8. They indicate that, although the fit of the models in the&#13;
two periods is quite good, the coefficients are not temporally stable.&#13;
This may be explained, in part, by Ehifts in relative prices.&#13;
Another indication that relative prices did not remain stable over&#13;
the observed periods is that factor analyses done with the food prices&#13;
for 1974/75 and 1980 generated factors with quite different structures&#13;
for each period.&#13;
Although our analysis indicates that each food item did not present&#13;
temporal price stability, we also investigated the possibility that the&#13;
basic diet price structure did not shift significantly. For this, a&#13;
"staple" portion of the diet was defined as five food items selected on&#13;
the basis of their, weights in the minimum diet cost (rice, black beans,&#13;
milk, bread and manioc flour). The methodology was tested through&#13;

The results of this approach are presented in Table 9 and demonstrate.&#13;
that the staple share shifted less than might 'have been expected from&#13;
the individual food item regression coefficients. Thus, although the&#13;
price of each food item was not very stable over the period, the cumulative&#13;
price changes of the items within the staple share tended to have a&#13;
relatively stable net effect in most of the sample cities.&#13;
The mean of the ratio of predicted to observed minimum diet cost&#13;
(Col. 6 of Table 9) is 1.06, with a standard deviation of 0.10.and&#13;
coefficient of variability of 0.09. The greatest overestimate (27%)&#13;
occurred in Belo Horizonte; the largest underestimate (13%) in Porto&#13;
Velho. There was a less than 5% difference in predicted and observed&#13;
costs in 9 of the 25 cases.&#13;
The regression and staple share methodologies were also developed&#13;
in an attempt to identify an instrument for future calculations of&#13;
absolute poverty lines with readily available data, at a low cost and&#13;
with a reasonable degree of accuracy.   The results indicate that the&#13;
staple. share approach is superior.  In addition to decreasing the problem&#13;
of temporal price stability, the-share methodology also avoids the&#13;
problems of multi-colinearity and presents less demanding data requirement:se&#13;

4.3 Comparisons of Poverty Lines by City Size&#13;
Table 10 presents the major indicators of absolute poverty in 1974&#13;
and 1980, with averages for all the cities, and disaggregated averages&#13;
for the major size categories:  metropolitan and non-metropolitan, or&#13;
medium-sized cities. Given the significantly higher cost of food in the&#13;
Northern cities, another category of medium-sized cities, excluding the&#13;
Northern region, was created.&#13;
Two counter-balancing effects on the poverty lines may be noted.&#13;
On one hand, differences in the cost of the minimum diet tended to&#13;
decrease over the period. The most expensive diet in 1974 (medium-sized&#13;
cities) had the smallest increase. The opposite occurred in the metro-&#13;
politan cities. This would tend to cause the poverty lines in the&#13;
metropolitan cities to increase relatively more than the medium-sized&#13;
cities over the period.  The lower food share (s) values     of metro-&#13;
politan cities tend to reinforce this tendency. On the other hand, the&#13;
changes in the minimum salary structure, as already discussed, with&#13;
convergence toward the highest national values, tended to off-set the&#13;
food cost difference on the poverty lines expressed in regional minimum&#13;
salaries. The net effect 4/ was to change rather significant city-size&#13;
differences in the family poverty lines in 1974 to essentially the same&#13;
figure for all categories in 1980.&#13;
4.4 Regional Comparisons of the Poverty Lines&#13;
.Table 11 presents an inter and intraregional perspective of the&#13;
poverty lines. Some of the general patterns discussed in the previous&#13;
-/Differences in s values are consistent with our knowledge of&#13;
Brazilian cities and location theory. In the metropolitan regions,&#13;
families must spend relatively more of disposable income on non-food&#13;
items than in smaller cities, particularly for land rent and/or trans-&#13;
portation. Thus, in general, a family living in a metropolitan region&#13;
with the same food expenditure as a family in a medium-sized city would&#13;
require more income to have approximately the same level of welfare.&#13;
4/ The average family size differences are too small to merit much&#13;
discussion.  However, the small difference in favor of smaller families&#13;
in metropolitan regions tendsto complement the general trend described.&#13;

section apply here. For example, the food share (s) of the metropolitan&#13;
cities is lower than the s for other cities in all relevant regions.&#13;
The metropolitan city of the North had the lowest minimum diet cost in&#13;
1974, and the largest diet cost increase relative to Qther cities of the&#13;
region. However, differences in metropolitan versus non-metropolitan&#13;
diet costs were negligible in the Northeast, and the pattern was inverted&#13;
in the Central South and South.&#13;
The net effect on family poverty line estimates was to increase&#13;
within-region differences in the North over the period, decrease them in'&#13;
the Central South and to have an 'essentially neutral 'impact in the&#13;
Northeast and the South.&#13;
A comparison of the indicators persented in Tables 10 and 11 shows&#13;
that a substantial amount of intraregional differences in absolute&#13;
poverty line indicators by city size is lost when national aggregation&#13;
by city size is done.&#13;
Table 12 further examines internal intraregional differences in the&#13;
poverty'indicators.  With the exception of the North Region, the amount&#13;
of variation between the cities within each of the five Macro-Regions is&#13;
'relatively low. The greater variation within the North is due to the&#13;
inclusion of Belem with the other capitals of the States and Territories&#13;
of the Amazon River Basin, where the cost of food is-quite high.&#13;
Considering the low number of observations, the F statistic is not&#13;
presented as a formal statistical test of the differences in population&#13;
means. Rather, it should be regarded as a rough indicator of how the&#13;
ratio of inter to intraregional variation in the per capita minimum diet&#13;
'costs and poverty line's changed over the period. In other words, it can&#13;
be seen as a measure of the ratio of the variation in the mean values of&#13;
these poverty indicators between the macro-regions to that within the&#13;
regions.. For both per capita diets and current cruzeiro poverty lines,&#13;
the ratio decreased from 1974/75 to 1980. Although these decreases are&#13;
not conclusive, they suggest that the interregional differences in food&#13;
costs may be decreasing over time. This is an especially important&#13;
potential trend to note because it is based on direct cost information&#13;
and is not influenced by food share, family size or minimum salary,&#13;
considerations.&#13;

Perhaps even more important than this trend, however, is to observe&#13;
in Table 12 that the average per capita cost of the minimum diet is&#13;
highest in the pooLCr regions for both periods.   This has significant&#13;
implications for evaluating the absolute poverty line estimates in terms&#13;
of the Bank's relative poverty standard and is a subject of the following&#13;
chapter.&#13;
39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.   COMPARISON OF ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE POVERTY LINES AND EVALUATION OF RESULTS&#13;
An up-date of the World Bank's relative, urban poverty line is.&#13;
estimated in Annex I to be Cr$ 6,745 of monthly income for a family of&#13;
average size in 1979. The key question here is how to interpret this&#13;
figure: -what standard unit of account best interprets this cruzeiro&#13;
amount over time and between cities.&#13;
The current approach of the Bank is to standardize the cruzeiro,&#13;
figure through.use of the highest regional minimum salary as the unit of&#13;
account.  This is assumed to be an indicator which is relatively stable&#13;
over time - , with regional differences in the cost of living accurately&#13;
reflected in the regional differences in the minimum salary.&#13;
The policy of the Brazilian government has been to establish the&#13;
highest regional minimum salary in the richer regions, the Central South&#13;
and South, and the lowest in the poorest region, the Northeast, with the&#13;
2/&#13;
North and Center-West having intermediate level. -    Estimates of the&#13;
per capita costs of the minimum diet (Table 12) indicate that the Bank's&#13;
assumption about regional differences in the minimum salary accurately&#13;
reflecting regional differences in the cost of living may not be valid.&#13;
With the exceptions of the North Region, and the Center-West in 1974/75,&#13;
the Northeast had the highest per capita cost of the nutritionally&#13;
adequate diet, and the South the lowest cost in both periods.&#13;
Our methodology is focused on absolute poverty indicators based on&#13;
a nutritional standard. Because the absolute poverty lines are estimated&#13;
from the food cost share of total family expenditures, we can make only&#13;
inferences about the non-food share of total expenditures. We can&#13;
conclude, however, that to the extent our minimum cost, nutritionally&#13;
adequate food basket is accurately defined and weighted, and valid over&#13;
time and between cities, then the cost of a nutritionally adequate diet&#13;
has been and continues to be greater in the poorer regions with lower&#13;
l/ The assumed temporal stability has been verified, at least over&#13;
the last five years.&#13;
2/&#13;
-/Current exceptions are Recife and Salvador of the Northeast&#13;
having a middle-level regional minimum salary and the Center-West's&#13;
Brasilia having the highest level.&#13;
40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
regional minimum slaries. Unless the non-food expenditures are substan-&#13;
tially less in the poor cities, the assumption about regional minimum&#13;
slaries accurately reflecting cost of living differences is not valid..&#13;
This study's scope did not permit-direct analysis of non-food&#13;
expenditures. The food share estimate of total expenditures is based on&#13;
the observed share in the expenditure interval closest to the Bank's&#13;
relative poverty line of each ENDEF region in 1974/75. An up-dating of&#13;
food and non-food shares would be a valuable complement to the present&#13;
study.&#13;
Table 13 presents a regional summary of the absolute and relative&#13;
poverty line estimates.. With current criteria, the Bank's relative&#13;
standard is three regional minimum salaries in all cities of all regions.&#13;
As a basis of comparison, the relative poverty line estimate in cruzeiros&#13;
is also expressed in units of the relevant regional minimum salary.&#13;
Because of the trend to reduce the number of minimum salaries, the&#13;
absolute estimates are also presented in units of the highest minimum&#13;
salary.&#13;
In the 1974/75 period, the absolute estimates expressed in RMS are&#13;
higher than the relative standard of three HMS in the North and Northeast.&#13;
When the relative estimate is expressed in RMS, this occurs only in the&#13;
case of the North. In 1980, relative estimates expressed in both HMS&#13;
and RMS are higher than the absolute estimates expressed in RMS, with&#13;
slight exceptions in the North and Northeast. As discussed earlier,&#13;
changes in the regional minimum salary levels make interpretation of&#13;
these figures difficult.&#13;
Table 14 attempts to facilitate this interpretation through presenting&#13;
the ratios of the absolute estimates to the relative estimates. One way&#13;
of interpreting the ratios is that the higher the ratio, the greater&#13;
the risk of excluding poor people from the target group..  A relatively&#13;
lower ratio presents the risk of including non-poor in the group.&#13;
Another way of interpreting the ratios is that less distortions in the&#13;
application of the Bank's relative poverty criterion should result when&#13;
the ratios vary little between regions.&#13;

Column 1 of Table 14 presents an evaluation of the current Bank&#13;
policy to express the relative poverty line in terms of the highest&#13;
regional minimum salary. Although the range of the ratio values decreased&#13;
from 1974/75 to 1980, the risk of excluding the poor remains highest in&#13;
the North and Northeast and the risk of including non-poor is greater in&#13;
the South in both periods.&#13;
If the normative interpretations of the ratios are correct, Column&#13;
2 presents a superior application of the Bank's relative poverty criterion.&#13;
The range of the ratio values is less in both periods when compared to&#13;
Column 1, and the poorest region, the Northeast, has less risk of having&#13;
its poor excluded from the benefits of Bank financed projects.&#13;
Column 3 of Table 14 presents an evaluation of what may happen: an&#13;
evolution to one, national minimum salary. Comparison of this column's&#13;
ratios to those of Column 1 indicates that the trend to less regional&#13;
variation in the minimum salary should decrease the potential risks of&#13;
the current application of the Bank's relative poverty standard.&#13;
The major conclusion of this study is that an evaluation of the&#13;
application of the Bank's relative poverty criterion through estimates&#13;
of absolute poverty lines indicates that the use of regional minimum&#13;
salaries in translTaing the national, urban relative poverty line in&#13;
cruzeiros to minimum salary units would decrease the risks of bias in&#13;
urban project design and appraisal. Specifically, this recommendation&#13;
means that the Bank would better evaluate the poverty impact of its&#13;
projects by substituting the standard of three regional minimum salaries&#13;
in all cities with three regional minimum salaries in the cities of the&#13;
Central South, South and Brasilia, and four regional minimum salaries in&#13;
the cities of the North, Northeast, Cuiaba and Goiania.&#13;
The impact of this recommendation in terms of the number of families&#13;
considered to be in the urban poverty target group is presented in&#13;
Tables 15-18. For these tables, Annex III data were used. There, a&#13;
series of tables presents the size distribution of family expenditures&#13;
for the 15 ENDEF regions uised in this study. These tables permit an&#13;
estimate of the percentage of families with expenditures less than the&#13;
poverty lines according to the various criteria.   These estimates are&#13;
44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
not precise, because families are grouped by expenditure intervals and&#13;
linear interpolation, of course, is not very accurate. They should,&#13;
however, provide an acceptable "order of magnitude" useful for comparison&#13;
of the impacts of the diffirent criteria.&#13;
Table 18 demonstrates that the recommended change in application of&#13;
the Bank's relative poverty criterion would result in a slight (approximately&#13;
3%) increase in the percent-age of urban.families considered poor in the&#13;
25 cities surveyed.&#13;
The overall impact of the recommended change in the relative poverty&#13;
criterion application is relatively small, of course, because of the&#13;
large number of families in the Central South and South regions, where&#13;
no change is recommended. Operationally,. the recommendation would mean&#13;
that some 280 thousand families of the North, Northeast,. and Cuiaba and&#13;
Goiania would be considered poor, while under the current application&#13;
of the criterion they would not be considered poor. The recommended&#13;
change would decrease the risk of excluding poor families from the&#13;
target group, while, of course, increasing the risk of including the&#13;
non-poor.&#13;
Other considerations of estimating the poverty lines, especially&#13;
variations in family size, monetary versus non-monetary income and use&#13;
of the "behavioral" diet, are presented in Annex IV.&#13;

ANNEX I - 1979 ESTIMATES OF URBAN POVERTY LINES IN BRAZIL ACCORDING TO&#13;
WORLD BANK GUIDELINES&#13;
This annex seeks to update urban poverty line estimates for Brazil,&#13;
using World Bank guidelines and criteria. -/ The latest national accounts&#13;
and population estimates available are for 1979. A poverty line is&#13;
understood to mean the level of family income below which a family may&#13;
be considered poor. A poverty line is necessary to estimate the extent&#13;
to which benefits of Bank-financed projects will be channeled as directly&#13;
as possible to the urban poverty target group.&#13;
Classified as a "middle-income country", Brazil's urban poverty&#13;
target group is defined through the concept of relative poverty, in&#13;
which the target threshold, or poverty line, is calculated as one-third&#13;
of the national per capita income,.adjusted for urban-rural price&#13;
differences.2/ Operationally, the Bank's urban poverty line has been&#13;
calculated at the national level in minimum salary units. The minimum&#13;
salary is defined by law in Brazil and is the unit of account for many&#13;
income statistics. Currently, each Municipality is classified as belonging&#13;
to one of three minimum salary levels. -/ Thus, the Bank presently uses&#13;
a single urban poverty line, with expectation that regional differences&#13;
in the cost of living are accurately reflected by the regionally differentiated&#13;
minimum salary.&#13;
A rather detailed record of the calculations used in estimating&#13;
1979 poverty line is presented below. When relevant, data Adentification&#13;
in the original Portuguese is included in parentheses to facilitate the&#13;
identification of our data sources. These details are included in order&#13;
to make possible as precise comparisions as possible of the estimates&#13;
presented here with former ones, or future updates.&#13;
l/Bank guidelines and criteria are taken from Office Memorandum to&#13;
country economists from Messrs. Ted J. Davis and Alastair J. Stone: Subject -&#13;
"Updating Poverty Income Levels," Date - July 7, 1978. Especially,&#13;
Attachment 5, Page 5.&#13;

Context of the World Bank's Activities," (Washington, D.C.: World Bank&#13;
Consultant's Report, March 1981), pp. 4-5.&#13;
3 The highest minimum salaries apply to the South and Southeast&#13;
regions; an intermediate level is established for most of the frontier&#13;
(Central-West and Amazon regions), except Brasilia; the lowest level&#13;
applies to most of the Northeast, with the major exceptions of Recife&#13;
and Salvador, which have an intermediate level minimum salary.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Per Capita Total Personal Income = Urban Internal     come -&#13;
(Renda Interna Urbana) + Urban Population in 1979 -    (populacao urbana)&#13;
C Gr$ 4,331,925.3 x 10 * 78.495 x 106 = Cr$ 55,187 per capita&#13;
1/3 of per capita TPI = Cr$ 18,396 per year&#13;
= Cr$ 1,533 per month&#13;
1/3 of family TPI per month. = 1/3 of per capita TPI x As&#13;
= Cr$ 1,533 x 4.4&#13;
= Cr$ 6,745&#13;
Thus, Cr$ 6,745 of family monthly income in 1979 cruzeiros is our&#13;
best estimate of the relative poverty line according to World Bank&#13;
criteria. Table I.1 present this income level for each surveyed city&#13;
expressed in regional minimum salary units established for the May 1 -&#13;
October 31, 1979 period.   Interpretation of Table I.1 depends on one's&#13;
opinion about the relationship between regional minimum salary levels&#13;
and the family welfare potential of each level. If each minimum salary&#13;
level provides approximately the same welfare potential, then a national,&#13;
urban poverty line of three minimum salaries, wherever earned, would be&#13;
appropriate. If, however, the cost of obtaining basic goods and services&#13;
most relevant to a poverty line definition is approximately equal in&#13;
each city, then the city-specific poverty lines presented in Table I.1&#13;
would be more accurate. This question is examined further in the main&#13;
text.&#13;

5-/IBGE, Sinopse Preliminar do Censo Demografico - Brasil (Rio de&#13;
Janeiro: IBGE, 1981), pp. 10-11. 1979 urban population was estimated&#13;
from 1970 urban population (52,905 x 103) and 1980 urban population&#13;
(82,013 x 103). The 1970-80 growth rate was calculated.(4.4813%p.a.)&#13;
and applied to 1970-79. The figures presented here are slightly different&#13;
from other published data, setting 1970 urban population at 52,085 x&#13;
103. Presumably, the 1980 census data incorporates corrections in&#13;
earlier data. At least part of the discrepancy may be explained by&#13;
earlier estimates sometimes not including PNAD-1976 Region VII (Amazon&#13;
and Mato Grosso and Goias). See IBGE, Indicadores Sociais - Relatorio 1979&#13;

ANNEX II POVERTY LINE FOOD BASKET&#13;
This Annex complements Chapter 3 of this paper.   There we describe the&#13;
FGV nutrition survey sample, selection of a nutritionally adequate, minimum&#13;
cost food basket and the adjustments necessary to make the basket components&#13;
compatible with city-specific food prices. Here we present more details on&#13;
the procedure used.&#13;
Table 11.1 presents the sample population by family size and type of&#13;
apartment. If more than two people per bedroom is considered as overcrowding,&#13;
then 103 (44%) families were overcrowded, with 17% of the total having more&#13;
than seven members.&#13;

SOURCE: FGV - Pesquisa, Table 3.13, p. 26.&#13;
In adjusting the selected least cost, nutritionally adequate diet (Table 4)&#13;
to make it compatible with the INP food price data, it was necessary to make&#13;
the following substitutions: kale by tomatoes and black beans; sardines by milk;&#13;
pepper by garlic. The other missing element, liver, presented the greatest&#13;
difficulty. Liver's high iron and vitamin B 1 quantities made the results of&#13;
substitution undesirable. Replacing these nutrients through othdr items caused&#13;
replacement quantities to be inordinantly high as well as substantially increasing&#13;
tlv total basket cost. Therefore, a proxy for liver was estimated in terms of&#13;
2nd class meat. Using the price ratio of liver to meat, we added 2.3 kg. of&#13;
2nd class meat to approximate the cost of buying 1.5 kg. of liver.&#13;
rL-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In addition, the INP price data have some items in different units&#13;
than the FGV, which standardized all items in kg. We used the following&#13;
conversion factors:  1 dozen oranges = 2 kg.; 1 dozen eggs = 0.75 kg.; 1&#13;
liter of milk = 1 kg.&#13;
An evaluation of the adjustments made in the reference diet may be&#13;
obtained from Tables II.2 - II.4.   Table II.2 presents the nutritional&#13;
requirements for the sampled families (4.72 adult equivalents) on a&#13;
daily and monthly basis. Day to month conversion was made through&#13;
multiplication by 30.42. Table II.3 presents the nutritional performance&#13;
of our adjusted diet and Table II.4 a comparison of the FGV diet, our&#13;
adjusted one, and the impact of considering the standard family as&#13;
having 5 members. We opted for considering the poverty line diet as&#13;
relevant for a family of 5. This facilitated data manipulation; its&#13;
impact is to potentially'introduce an additional conservative bias in&#13;
our poverty line estimates,- although it is probable that errors in&#13;
estimates of food item nutritional quality, and other data errors,&#13;
greatly exceed this'difference. 1/&#13;
Our use of the FGV minimum nutritional requirements should not be&#13;
interpreted as a normative judgement on our part. Rather,we accept them&#13;
as a necessary input to our model. Higher requirements could, and&#13;
perhaps should, be used. They would, of course, increase the minimum&#13;
diet cost and absolute poverty line estimates.&#13;
1/   The FGV "typical family" had the following composition:&#13;
father 40 years old, 1.73 m. tall weighing 70 kg. and executing medium&#13;
intensity work; mother 34 years old, 1.63 m. tall, weighing 58 kg. with&#13;
medium intensity work; son of 15 years, 1.70 m. tall and 59 kg; daughter&#13;
of 13 years, 1.54 m. tall and 44 kg; son of 7 years, 1.21 m. tall and 23&#13;
kg. FGV calculated this family as having 4.72 adult equivalents. In&#13;
our estimate of the poverty line, we considered this family as composed&#13;
of 5 adults. See FGV-Dietas, p. 7.&#13;

ANNEX IV - SENSITIVITY TESTS FOR THE ABSOLUTE POVERTY LINE ESTIMATES&#13;
This Annex presents additional considerations about the absolute&#13;
poverty lines estimated.   Although these considerations may be of some&#13;
general interest, they should be most relevant if the recommendations&#13;
made in Chapter 5 are followed.&#13;
IV.1 Use of Average Family Size Data&#13;
Our estimates of the family poverty lines are based on the average&#13;
family size in each city. Although this may introduce errors with any&#13;
use of the estimates, distortions should be less serious when the project&#13;
under examination is city-wide in impact. This may be the case, for&#13;
example, with a transport corridor project, which will affect practically&#13;
all the people of the city. With highly "localized" projects, such as&#13;
sites and services, the potential bias of using average family size is&#13;
larger.&#13;
Depending on the dispersion-of family sizes from the mean, the&#13;
average figures produce risks of including non-poor families in the&#13;
target group as well as excluding the poor. To help evaluate these&#13;
risks, Table IV.1 presents the size distribution of all families, not&#13;
just those considered poor. If we consider a deviation of two family&#13;
members below the average as an indicator of including families who are&#13;
not really poor, and twd family members above the average as an indicator&#13;
of excluding families who are poor; then Table IV.2 presents estimates&#13;
of project risks resulting from thle use of average family sizes. These&#13;
estimates should not be interpreted as rigorous. Rather, they seek to&#13;
serve as a practical guide to Bank mission project preparation and&#13;
appraisal. They present "orders of magnitude" which may alert mission&#13;
members to treat aggregated data with caution and perhaps indicate when&#13;
supplementary information should be collected in tl&#143;e field. To the&#13;
extent that poorer families tend to have more members than richer&#13;
families, Table IV.2 estimates underestimate the risks of excluding-the&#13;
poor. On the other hand, Table IV.2 does not consider economies of&#13;
scale in household consumption.&#13;

IV.2 Use of Monetary Versus Non-Monetary Income Data&#13;
Sometimes data in Brazil do not include non-monetary income.&#13;
Assuming that in urban areas non-monetary income is basically derived&#13;
from imputed housing rents, ENDEF provides data which allow an estimate&#13;
of the impact of excluding these rents.&#13;
Previous poverty line estimates were based on the food share (s) of&#13;
total family budgets going to food. Excludin,g imputed rents from total&#13;
family expenditures decreases the denominator while the numerator remains&#13;
fixed. The new food share, xs, will, of course, be larger. This., in&#13;
turn, means that the poverty lines estimated with xs will be lower than&#13;
those estimated with s.&#13;
Table IV.3 presents new absolute poverty estimates based on xs.&#13;
Comparison of this Table's estimates with those presented in Tables 6&#13;
and 7 permits quick conversions from income data which do not include&#13;
non-monetary income to more complete income estimates.&#13;
IV.3 Use of Beahvioral Diet in Absolute Poverty Line Estimates&#13;
As discussed in Chapter 3 and Annex II, our definition of the&#13;
family minimum diet may have introduced a conservative bias in our&#13;
estimates. Actual expenditures of the FGV surveyed families vere almost&#13;
20% greater than the cost of the diet used here. Comparative price&#13;
shopping and other "information costs," as well as eating habits, may&#13;
cause the actual diet cost of low-income families to be substantially&#13;
greater than the cost estimated here. In addition, we adjusted the FGV&#13;
family size up, from 4.72 adult equivalents to 5 "imouths to feed."&#13;
This, of course, slightly reduces the per capita family food expenditures&#13;
estimates.&#13;
In order to off-set this potential bias, Table IV.4 presents 1980&#13;
poverty line estimates resulting from increasing the family mainimum diet&#13;
cost by 20%. Although these new estimates do not have direct relevance&#13;
to the present study, they may be useful in comparison with studies in&#13;
other countries or with future up-dates and extensions in Brazil, particularly&#13;
if new minimum cost, nutritionally adequate food baskets are defined&#13;
with more recent data.&#13;

            Identifying the urban poor in Brazil
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper investigates the degree to
            which the use of a single urban poverty threshold in Brazil
            leads to biased project identification, design, and
            evaluation. Analysis of the causes of proverty is beyond its
            scope. Absolute poverty lines are defined through the use of
            estimates of expenditures for mimimum cost, nutritionally
            adequate diets and food shares of total expenditures by
            families with incomes roughly equivalent to the Bank's
            relative poverty standard of three minimum salaries. The
            main findings are: (i) interpretation of data expressed in
            minimum salary units presents several difficulties; (ii)
            relative prices of each element of the food basket were not
            stable, but of a staple portion of five items were stable;
            (iii) the average per capita cost of the food basket was
            highest in the poorer regions; (iv) converting the national
            poverty line expressed in cruzeiros to minimum salaries
            expressed in regional values would decrease the risks of
            bias in urban project design and appraisal; and (v) the
            methodology presented could be reproduced in other
            middle-income countries.
