  Management's Discussion &amp; Analysis&#13;
  of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I.          OVERVIEW&#13;
&#13;
     International Finance Corporation (IFC or the Corporation) is an international organization, established in 1956, to further economic&#13;
     growth in its developing member countries by promoting private sector development. IFC is a member of the World Bank Group, which&#13;
     also includes the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD or the World Bank), the International Development&#13;
     Association (IDA), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). It is a legal entity separate and distinct from the World&#13;
     Bank, IDA, and MIGA, with its own Articles of Agreement, share capital, financial structure, management, and staff. Membership in IFC&#13;
     is open only to member countries of the World Bank. As of June 30, 2003 IFC's entire share capital was held by 175 member countries.&#13;
&#13;
     IFC's principal products are loans and equity investments, with a small but growing guarantee portfolio. Unlike most multilateral&#13;
     development institutions, IFC does not accept host government guarantees. IFC raises virtually all of the funds for its lending activities&#13;
     through the issuance of debt obligations in the international capital markets, while maintaining a small borrowing window with the World&#13;
     Bank. Equity investments are funded from net worth. During the year ended June 30, 2003 (FY03), IFC had an authorized borrowing&#13;
     ceiling of $4.5 billion (including $1.0 billion to allow for possible prefunding of the funding program for the year to June 30, 2004 (FY04)&#13;
     during FY03).&#13;
&#13;
     IFC's capital base and its assets and liabilities are primarily denominated in US dollars. The Corporation seeks to minimize market risk&#13;
     (foreign exchange and interest rate risks) by closely matching the currency, rate bases, and maturity of its liabilities in various currencies&#13;
     with assets with the same characteristics. The Corporation controls residual market risk by utilizing currency and interest rate swaps&#13;
     and other derivative instruments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     II.         FINANCIAL SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
     Basis of preparation of the Corporation's financial statements&#13;
&#13;
     The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (US&#13;
     GAAP).&#13;
&#13;
     The Corporation has traditionally prepared one set of financial statements and footnotes, complying with both US GAAP and&#13;
     International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). However, due to material differences between US Statement of Financial&#13;
     Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 138,&#13;
     Accounting for Certain Derivatives and Certain Hedging Relationships (collectively SFAS No. 133), which became effective for the&#13;
     Corporation on July 1, 2000, and its counterpart in IFRS, IAS No. 39, Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement, which&#13;
     became effective for the Corporation on July 1, 2001, it is no longer possible for the Corporation to satisfy the requirements of both US&#13;
     GAAP and IFRS via one set of financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
     IFC is actively monitoring developments related to accounting standards and the primary basis for preparation of its financial&#13;
     statements, all with a view to the necessary systems and controls to manage its various lines of business. IFC plans to resume&#13;
     presentation of its financial statements using IFRS by the year ending June 30, 2007.&#13;
&#13;
     Unless stated otherwise, discussions of financial performance herein refer to operating income, which excludes the effects of adopting&#13;
     SFAS No. 133. The effects of SFAS No. 133 on net income are discussed in Section VII.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Financial performance summary&#13;
&#13;
     From year to year, IFC's operating income is affected by a number of factors, principally the magnitude of provisions for losses against&#13;
     its loans, equity investments and guarantees; loans in nonaccrual status and recoveries of interest on loans formerly in nonaccrual&#13;
     status; and income (dividends and capital gains) generated from its equity portfolio. A significant part of IFC's liquid assets portfolio is&#13;
     invested in fixed income securities, which are also subject to external market factors that affect the value of such securities, adding&#13;
     variability to operating income. Beginning in FY01, net income also includes unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments other&#13;
     than from trading activities, pursuant to the implementation of SFAS No. 133.&#13;
&#13;
     IFC has been consistently profitable since its inception in 1956, and recorded operating income for FY03 of $528 million, as compared&#13;
     with $161 million for the year ended June 30, 2002 (FY02), and $241 million for the year ended June 30, 2001 (FY01). The $528 million&#13;
     of operating income in FY03 was a record high for the Corporation, reflecting contributions across each of IFC's main business&#13;
     segments: loans, equities and treasury operations. The Corporation was able to record net income in FY03, including the effects of&#13;
     SFAS No. 133, of $487 million, as compared with $215 million for FY02 and $345 million for FY01.&#13;

     III.       CLIENT SERVICES&#13;
&#13;
     Business overview&#13;
&#13;
     In partnership with private investors, IFC assists in financing the establishment, improvement, and expansion of private sector&#13;
     enterprises by making investments where sufficient private capital is not otherwise available on reasonable terms. IFC seeks to bring&#13;
     together domestic and foreign private capital and experienced management and thereby create conditions conducive to the flow of&#13;
     private capital, domestic and foreign, into productive investments in its developing member countries. In this way, IFC plays a catalytic&#13;
     role in mobilizing additional project funding from other investors and lenders, either through cofinancing or through loan syndications,&#13;
     underwritings, and guarantees. In addition to project finance (described below) and resource mobilization, IFC offers financial and&#13;
     technical advisory services to private businesses in developing member countries. It also advises member governments on private&#13;
     sector development matters.&#13;
&#13;
     IFC's investments are normally made in its developing member countries. The Articles of Agreement mandate that IFC shall invest in&#13;
     productive private enterprise. The requirement for private ownership does not disqualify enterprises that are partly owned by the public&#13;
     sector if such enterprises are organized under local commercial and corporate law, operate free of host government control in a market&#13;
     context and according to profitability criteria, and/or are in the process of being totally or partially privatized.&#13;
&#13;
     The Corporation's main investment activity is project financing. This encompasses "greenfield" projects, expansions, and&#13;
     modernizations. IFC also provides corporate credits to selected companies to finance ongoing programs of investment projects. In&#13;
     addition, the Corporation facilitates financing through financial intermediaries, covering project and general purpose lending and&#13;
     specialized lending products such as leasing, trade, and mortgage finance. These financial intermediaries function either as IFC's&#13;
     borrower, on-lending to private sector companies at their own risk, or as IFC's agent, identifying companies for direct loans from IFC.&#13;
&#13;
     The Corporation applies stringent tests of enterprise soundness, project viability, and developmental impact in determining the eligibility&#13;
     of projects for its investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Investment process and portfolio supervision&#13;
&#13;
     IFC's investment process can be divided into six main stages:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Identification            Board              Document&#13;
                                                                          Commitment             Disbursement            Supervision&#13;
        &amp; appraisal            approval            negotiation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The initial four stages are carried out under the responsibility of the Vice President, Investment Operations, while the fifth and sixth&#13;
     stages are overseen by the Vice President, Portfolio and Risk Management.&#13;
&#13;
     The Corporation carefully supervises its projects to monitor project performance and compliance with contractual obligations and with&#13;
     IFC's internal policies and procedures. IFC's Board of Directors is informed of such matters and of recommended courses of action at&#13;
     regular intervals.&#13;

Investment program summary&#13;
&#13;
Commitments&#13;
In FY03, the Corporation entered into new commitments totaling $3.9 billion, including $0.4 billion of signed guarantees, compared with&#13;
$3.1 billion (including $0.3 billion of signed guarantees) for FY02. Loan and equity investment commitments pending disbursement at&#13;
June 30, 2003 were $3.5 billion ($3.4 billion at June 30, 2002). Guarantees and client risk management facilities committed but not&#13;
utilized at June 30, 2003, were $0.9 billion ($0.7 billion at June 30, 2002). FY03 and FY02 commitments comprised the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    4,000                                                  Guarantees &amp; other&#13;

Disbursements&#13;
IFC disbursed $3.0 billion for its own account in FY03 ($1.5 billion in FY02). The strong level of disbursements in FY03, as compared to&#13;
FY02 and FY01 ($1.5 billion), reflects the changed focus on the Corporation toward commitments as a measure of operational&#13;
performance over the past two years, which has resulted in higher disbursement levels, particularly in FY03. In addition, in FY02 and&#13;
FY01, the Corporation faced a difficult investment climate in the emerging markets in which it operates, together with a changing product&#13;
mix from direct investment products such as loans and equity investments to off-balance sheet products such as guarantees. At June&#13;
30, 2003, IFC's disbursed and outstanding loans and equity investments for its own account (disbursed investment portfolio) grew 12%&#13;
to $12.0 billion ($10.7 billion at June 30, 2002).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Approvals&#13;
In FY03 IFC approved new investments for its own account, including guarantees and client risk management facilities, totaling $4.0&#13;
billion, representing 186 projects, compared with $4.0 billion in FY02, representing 223 projects. In addition, IFC approved loan&#13;
participations (B-loans) arranged to be placed with financial institutions (Participants) for loans approved by the Corporation's Board of&#13;
Directors totaling $1.5 billion in 27 projects in FY03 compared with $1.9 billion in 39 projects in FY02. FY03 and FY02 approvals&#13;
comprised the following:&#13;

    Disbursed B-loans&#13;
     The portfolio of disbursed and outstanding B-loans at June 30, 2003 totaled $6.1 billion in 224 transactions compared with $5.7 billion in&#13;
     217 transactions at June 30, 2002.&#13;
&#13;
     Additional information on IFC's investment portfolio as of and for the years ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 can be found in Notes C, D&#13;
     and E to the Corporation's FY03 financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Investment products&#13;
&#13;
    Loans&#13;
     Loans account for the major part of the financing provided by IFC, representing 77% of the Corporation's disbursed investment portfolio&#13;
     as of June 30, 2003, as compared to 75% at June 30, 2002.&#13;
&#13;
     Loans will generally have the following characteristics:&#13;
&#13;
           Term: typically amortizing with final maturities of up to 12 years&#13;
           Currency: primarily in major convertible currencies, principally US dollar, and to a lesser extent, Euro, Swiss franc and Japanese&#13;
           yen&#13;
           Interest rate: fixed or variable&#13;
           Pricing: reflects such factors as market conditions and country and project risks; variable rate loans are generally tied to the 6-&#13;
           month LIBOR index in the relevant currency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Since the year ended June 30, 1999, IFC has offered local currency loan products to certain clients, provided the Corporation is able to&#13;
hedge its local currency exposure through mechanisms such as cross-currency swaps or forward contracts. Fixed-rate loans and loans&#13;
in currencies other than US dollars are normally transformed, using currency and/or interest rate swaps, into US dollar variable rate&#13;
loans.&#13;
&#13;
On June 30, 2003, total loans disbursed and outstanding were $9.2 billion ($8.0 billion at June 30, 2002). At June 30, 2003, 86% (89%&#13;
at June 30, 2002) of the Corporation's loans were US dollar-denominated.&#13;
&#13;
The currency composition of the loan portfolio at June 30, 2003 and 2002 is shown on the accompanying diagram:&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Equity&#13;
Equity investments accounted for 23% of the Corporation's disbursed investment portfolio at June 30, 2003, as compared to 25% at&#13;
June 30, 2002. IFC's equity investments are typically in the form of common or preferred stock and are usually denominated in the&#13;
currency of the country in which the investment is made.&#13;
&#13;
Quasi-equity&#13;
In addition to traditional equity investments, the Corporation provides financing through a variety of quasi-equity instruments, which&#13;
constitute a growing portion of its investment portfolio. Quasi-equities include subordinated or convertible loans, asset-backed securities,&#13;
mortgage-backed securities, and certain common or preferred shares with put and/or call features. Depending upon their&#13;
characteristics, quasi-equities may be classified as either loans or equity investments in the Corporation's balance sheet. At June 30,&#13;
2003, the Corporation's disbursed and outstanding quasi-equity portfolio totaled $1,571 million ($1,342 million at June 30, 2002), of&#13;
which $1,391 million was classified as loans ($1,157 million at June 30, 2002) and $180 million was classified as equity investments&#13;
($185 million at June 30, 2002) in the Corporation's balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
Loan participations (B-loans)&#13;
IFC finances only a portion, usually not more than 25%, of the cost of any project. All IFC-financed projects, therefore, require other&#13;
financial partners. The principal direct means by which the Corporation mobilizes such private sector finance is through the sale of&#13;
participations in its loans, known as the B-loan program. Through the B-loan program, IFC has worked primarily with commercial banks&#13;
but also with non bank financial institutions in financing projects since the early 1960s. More than 194 commercial banks and&#13;
institutional investors currently participate in IFC's B-loan program.&#13;
&#13;
Whenever it syndicates a loan, IFC will always make a loan for its own account (an A-loan), thereby sharing the risk alongside its loan&#13;
participants. IFC acts as the lender of record and is responsible for the administration of the entire loan, including the B-loan. IFC&#13;
charges fees to the borrower at prevailing market rates to cover the cost of the syndication of the B-loan. Since it began its loan&#13;
syndication program, IFC has placed participations totaling $21.5 billion.&#13;
&#13;
Client risk management services&#13;
IFC provides clients with access to asset and liability management tools such as currency swaps and interest rate swaps, caps and&#13;
floors by acting as an intermediary between clients and market counterparties. IFC also provides risk-sharing structures and guarantees&#13;
that allow its clients to transact directly with market counterparties.&#13;
&#13;
Guarantees and partial credit guarantees&#13;
Guarantees represent a growing product line for the Corporation. Beginning in FY01, the Corporation began offering partial credit&#13;
guarantees to clients covering, on a risk-sharing basis, client obligations on bonds and/or loans. The Corporation's guarantee is&#13;
available for debt instruments and trade obligations of clients and covers commercial as well as noncommercial risks. IFC will provide&#13;
local currency guarantees but generally only if the Corporation is able to fund its commitment in local currency terms, for example, by&#13;
hedging its exposure in the swap market. Guarantee fees are consistent with IFC's loan pricing policies. During FY03, the Corporation&#13;
signed $0.4 billion of guarantees, as compared with $0.3 billion in FY02.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     Underwritings and investment banking services&#13;
     IFC provides underwriting and placement services for equity, quasi-equity, and/or debt securities issues of private sector companies in&#13;
     IFC's developing member countries. It also structures and underwrites funds and pooled investment vehicles such as private equity&#13;
     investment funds. IFC is often a core investor in the enterprises it underwrites. Services are priced in conformity with market standards&#13;
     and practices, in consultation with international securities firms and financial intermediaries. Underwriting and other capital markets&#13;
     services requiring a financial commitment from IFC are subject to the same investment criteria and limits applicable to its loans and&#13;
     equity investments.&#13;
&#13;
     The Corporation does not conduct any placement activities within the United States or directed at US investors in connection with&#13;
     securities offerings of private sector companies or pooled investment vehicles.&#13;
&#13;
     Advisory activities&#13;
     The Corporation, on its own or through a department jointly managed with the World Bank, provides three general types of advisory&#13;
     services to member countries as well as to individual enterprises:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Special advisory services on project structuring and financial packaging&#13;
&#13;
          Financial advisory services provided to member governments or to private sector clients&#13;
&#13;
          Policy advice to governments on capital markets development and private sector development, including privatization and foreign&#13;
          investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The Corporation also assists governments with developing the legal frameworks for privatizing their state-owned sectors, as well as with&#13;
     the sale of individual enterprises. Fees are charged for advisory services consistent with market rates charged for comparable services.&#13;
     IFC recorded such fees amounting to $51 million for FY03 ($40 million for FY02 and $41 million for FY01).&#13;
&#13;
     Specially targeted assistance&#13;
     IFC has established a number of vehicles through which it provides specially targeted assistance to areas highly in need of&#13;
     development. In FY03, the Corporation contributed $28 million to such vehicles, compared with $22 million in FY02 and $16 million in&#13;
     FY01. In FY03, such vehicles included:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          The World Bank Group's Global SME Capacity Building Facility, which funds partnerships and programs that support the core&#13;
          pillars of the World Bank Group's Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise (SME) strategy.&#13;
&#13;
          The Private Enterprise Partnership, which provides focused technical assistance, with the goal of helping build successful private&#13;
          businesses in the former Soviet Union region.&#13;
&#13;
          The Corporation's own Technical Assistance Trust Fund, which provides resources through which IFC can cofinance technical&#13;
          assistance being supported by donors.&#13;

IV.         TREASURY SERVICES&#13;
&#13;
Liquid assets&#13;
&#13;
IFC invests its surplus liquidity in highly rated fixed and floating rate instruments issued by, or unconditionally guaranteed by,&#13;
governments, government agencies and instrumentalities, multilateral organizations, and AAA-rated corporate issuers, including&#13;
mortgage- and asset-backed securities, and in time deposits and other unconditional obligations of banks and financial institutions.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation manages the market risk associated with these investments through a variety of hedging techniques including&#13;
derivatives, principally currency and interest rate swaps and financial futures.&#13;
&#13;
IFC's liquid assets are invested in four separate portfolios.&#13;

&#13;
The P3 portfolio is not permitted to exceed 12% of the total value of liquid assets at any time.&#13;
&#13;
All portfolios are accounted for as trading portfolios.&#13;
&#13;
Beginning in FY01, the Corporation adopted a more flexible approach to managing the P1 portfolio by making investments on an&#13;
aggregate portfolio basis against its benchmark within specified risk parameters. The P2 portfolio is also actively managed on an&#13;
aggregate basis to its benchmark. In implementing these portfolio management strategies, the Corporation utilizes derivative&#13;
instruments, futures, and options, and takes long or short positions in securities.&#13;
&#13;
All liquid assets are managed according to an investment authority approved by IFC's Board of Directors and investment guidelines&#13;
approved by IFC's Finance and Risk Committee, a subcommittee of the Corporation's Management Group.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Borrowings&#13;
      The major source of IFC's borrowings is the international capital markets. Under the Articles of Agreement, the Corporation may borrow&#13;
      in the public markets of a member country only with approvals from that member and also the member in whose currency the borrowing&#13;
      is denominated. The Corporation borrowed $3.5 billion during FY03 ($4.0 billion in FY02 and $3.6 billion in FY01). In addition, IFC's&#13;
      Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase and redemption of and tender for debt obligations issued by the Corporation. During&#13;
      FY03, the Corporation repurchased and retired $116 million of outstanding debt ($186 million in FY02).&#13;
&#13;
      IFC diversifies its borrowings by currency, country, source, and maturity to provide flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Outstanding market&#13;
      borrowings have remaining maturities ranging from less than one year to almost 30 years, with a weighted average remaining maturity&#13;
      of 10.5 years at June 30, 2003 (8.8 years at June 30, 2002).&#13;
&#13;
      Market borrowings are generally swapped into floating-rate obligations denominated in US dollars. As of June 30, 2003 the Corporation&#13;
      had gross payables from borrowing-related currency swaps of $9.3 billion ($10.2 billion at June 30, 2002) and from borrowing-related&#13;
      interest rate swaps in the notional principal amount of $7.3 billion ($7.1 billion at June 30, 2002). After the effect of these derivative&#13;
      instruments is taken into consideration, all of the Corporation's market borrowings at June 30, 2003, and June 30, 2002, were US dollar-&#13;
      denominated.&#13;
&#13;
      The weighted average cost of market borrowings after currency and interest rate swap transactions was 0.9% at June 30, 2003 (1.8% at&#13;
      June 30, 2002).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Capital and retained earnings&#13;
      As of June 30, 2003 IFC's net worth (presented as Total Capital in the Corporation's balance sheet) amounted to $6.8 billion, up from&#13;
      the June 30, 2002 level of $6.3 billion.&#13;
&#13;
      As of June 30, 2003 and 2002, IFC's authorized capital was $2.45 billion, of which $2.36 billion was subscribed at June 30, 2003,&#13;
      unchanged from June 30, 2002. Over 99% of this was paid in ($2.36 billion at June 30, 2002, and June 30, 2001). The Corporation has&#13;
      agreed to defer the payment dates for certain member countries. Pursuant to these arrangements, $2 million of subscribed shares&#13;
      remained unpaid at June 30, 2003, unchanged from June 30, 2002.&#13;

framework, the Corporation has adopted several key financial and exposure policies and a&#13;
number of prudential policies.&#13;
                                                                                                                          Operational Risk&#13;
                                                                                                                           People, Systems&#13;

Business risk&#13;
&#13;
IFC defines business risk as the potential reputational, financial and other consequences of a failure to achieve its business mission&#13;
and, in particular, its sustainable development mandate.&#13;
&#13;
The overall management of business risk is effected through the definition and implementation of an annual business strategy for&#13;
meeting the Corporation's mission and guidelines for its operations. The strategy is developed with Senior Management by the&#13;
Operational Strategy Group, and is approved by the Board of Directors. The Operations Evaluation Group conducts ex post evaluation&#13;
of the implementation of the Corporation's strategy on an on-going basis.&#13;
&#13;
Business risk includes the risk incurred by IFC in exercising its environmental and social development framework in member countries.&#13;
Responsibility for managing this part of business risk rests with the Environmental and Social Development Department.&#13;
&#13;
The key guiding principles and policies established as part of the framework for controlling business risk are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Guiding principles for IFC's operations&#13;
Catalytic role: IFC will seek above all to be a catalyst in facilitating productive investments in the private sector of its developing&#13;
member countries. It does so by mobilizing financing from both foreign and domestic investors from the private and public sectors.&#13;
&#13;
Business partnership: IFC functions like a business in partnership with the private sector. Thus, IFC takes the same commercial&#13;
risks as do private institutions, investing its funds under the discipline of the marketplace.&#13;
&#13;
Additionality: IFC participates in an investment only when it can make a special contribution not offered or brought to the deal by&#13;
other investors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Environmental and social policies&#13;
The Corporation has developed a comprehensive set of Guidelines and Safeguard Policies to promote environmentally and&#13;
socially responsible private sector investments. Project sponsors are given the Safeguard Policies for environmental and social&#13;
issues to review prior to conducting their assessments, as well as the environmental, health, and safety guidelines specific to the&#13;
particular industry, sector, and type of project.&#13;
&#13;
When making investments, IFC applies its standards to the project and its performance is monitored against those standards.&#13;
Projects are expected to comply with the applicable policies and guidelines, as well as applicable local, national, and international&#13;
laws.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During FY03, IFC's Environmental and Social Policies became widely recognized as best practice when twelve international commercial&#13;
banks adopted them in the form of the Equator Principles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Credit risk&#13;
&#13;
IFC defines credit risk as the potential reduction in value of on- and off- balance sheet assets due to a deteriorating credit profile of its&#13;
clients, the countries in which it invests, or a financial counterparty. Credit risk is incurred in two areas of the Corporation's operations:&#13;
(i) in its investment operations, where IFC provides loans, equity investments, guarantees and derivatives for clients in its developing&#13;
member countries, and (ii) in its treasury operations, where credit risk is incurred with counterparties in its liquid asset investment,&#13;
borrowing and asset-liability management activities. As part of its mandate, IFC is prohibited from accepting host government&#13;
guarantees of repayment on its investments and, therefore, incurs commercial and sovereign risk on its investments.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation's Risk Management Group has oversight responsibility for overall credit risk management and, in addition, monitors&#13;
and controls credit risk arising in IFC's treasury activities. With respect to IFC's credit risk exposures to clients in developing countries,&#13;
the Credit Review Department also plays a key role. At origination of new investments, the Credit Review Department analyzes&#13;
information obtained from the investment departments and provides an independent review of the credit risk of the transaction. After&#13;
commitment, the quality of IFC's loan and equity investment portfolio is monitored according to supervision principles and procedures&#13;
defined in the Operational Procedures. Responsibility for the day-to-day monitoring and management of credit risk in the portfolio rests&#13;
with the portfolio management units of individual investment departments. Their assessments are subject to quarterly review, on a&#13;
sample basis, by the Portfolio Review Division of the Controller's Department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                             11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      The Corporation's investment portfolio is subject to a number of operational and prudential limits, including limitations on single project&#13;
      exposure, single country exposure, and segment concentration. Similarly, credit policies and guidelines have been formulated covering&#13;
      treasury operations; these are subject to annual revision by the Risk Management Group, and approval by the Finance and Risk&#13;
      Committee. Specifically, IFC has adopted the following key exposure policies:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Investment operations&#13;
&#13;
      1)    IFC does not normally finance for its own account more than 25% of a project's cost.&#13;
&#13;
      2)    An equity investment in a company does not normally represent more than 35% of the company's total share capital, provided&#13;
            further that IFC is not the single largest shareholder.&#13;
&#13;
      3)    An investment in a single project or entity may not exceed 3% of IFC's total investment portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
      4)    Equity and quasi-equity investments in a single project or entity may not exceed 3% of the Corporation's net worth plus general&#13;
            reserves.&#13;
&#13;
      5)    Total investments in a single country will not normally represent more than 12% of IFC's total investment portfolio or 25% of its&#13;
            net worth, whichever is lower.&#13;
&#13;
      6)    The Corporation's total exposure to a single risk sector may not exceed 8% of the total investment portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Treasury operations&#13;
&#13;
      1)    Counterparties are subject to conservative eligibility criteria, currently restricted to banks and financial institutions with a minimum&#13;
            credit rating of A by leading international credit rating agencies.&#13;
&#13;
      2)    Exposures to individual counterparties are subject to diversification caps. For derivatives, exposure is measured in terms of&#13;
            "worst case" potential exposure based on simulations of market variables. Institution-specific limits are updated monthly based&#13;
            on changes in counterparty size or credit status.&#13;
&#13;
      3)    To limit exposure, IFC signs collateral agreements with counterparties that require the posting of collateral when net exposure&#13;
            exceeds certain predetermined thresholds, which decrease as a counterparty's credit rating deteriorates.&#13;
&#13;
      4)    Because counterparties can be downgraded during the life of a transaction, the agreements provide an option for IFC to&#13;
            terminate all swaps if the counterparty is downgraded below investment grade or if other early termination events occur that are&#13;
            standard in the market.&#13;
&#13;
      5)    Limits are also imposed on the volume of over-the-counter derivative transactions with individual counterparties.&#13;
&#13;
      6)    For exchange-traded instruments, IFC limits credit risk by restricting transactions to a list of authorized exchanges, contracts and&#13;
            dealers, and by placing limits on the Corporation's open interest rate position in each contract.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      FY03 credit risk highlights&#13;
      IFC does not recognize income on loans where collectibility is in doubt or payments of interest or principal are past due more than 60&#13;
      days unless management anticipates that collection of interest is expected in the near future.&#13;
&#13;
      The amount of nonaccruing loans as a percentage of the disbursed loan portfolio, a key indicator of portfolio performance, increased to&#13;
      16.7% at June 30, 2003, compared with 15.2% at June 30, 2002. The principal amount outstanding on nonaccrual loans totaled $1,543&#13;
      million at June 30, 2003, an increase of 27% from the June 30, 2002 level of $1,217 million.&#13;
&#13;
      The quality of IFC's investment portfolio stabilized during the first quarter of FY03 and the aggregate risk level improved slightly during&#13;
      the last nine months of the year. As a result, total reserves against losses on loans and equity investments at June 30, 2003, decreased&#13;
      to $2,625 million ($2,771 million at June 30, 2002). This is equivalent to 21.9% of the disbursed portfolio, below the historical high of&#13;
      25.8% for the Corporation at June 30, 2002.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      The five-year trend of loss reserves is presented below:&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Given the Corporation's limited history with financial guarantees, IFC is working under the assumption that the guarantee portfolio is&#13;
      exposed to the same idiosyncratic and systematic risks as IFC's loan portfolio and the inherent, probable losses in the guarantee portfolio&#13;
      need to be covered by an allowance for loss. IFC also accrues anticipated losses associated with its guarantee portfolio. Beginning in&#13;
      FY01, the Corporation established such an allowance. The allowance at June 30, 2003, was $30 million ($29 million ­ June 30, 2002),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
based on the year-end portfolio, and is included in payables and other liabilities on the balance sheet. The charge for the year, $1 million for&#13;
FY03 ($16 million for FY02), is included in provisions for losses on loans, equity investments and guarantees in the income statement&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation has not suffered credit losses on its exposures to counterparties in its treasury operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Financial risk&#13;
&#13;
IFC defines financial risk in three components: (1) the potential inability to realize asset values in its portfolio sufficient to meet&#13;
obligations to disburse funds as they arise ("liquidity risk"); (2) the potential inability to access funding at reasonable cost ("funding risk");&#13;
and (3) a deterioration in values of financial instruments or positions due to changes in market interest and exchange rates and the&#13;
volatility thereof ("market risk").&#13;
&#13;
Financial risk is managed by IFC's Treasury Department, under oversight and monitoring by the Risk Management Group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Key financial policies&#13;
IFC currently operates under the following key financial policies, which have been approved by its Board of Directors:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1)   Disbursed equity plus quasi-equity investments (net of loss reserves) may not exceed 100% of net worth.&#13;
&#13;
2)   Minimum liquidity (liquid assets plus undrawn borrowing commitments from the World Bank) must be sufficient at all times to&#13;
     cover at least 65% of IFC's estimated net cash requirements for the next three years.&#13;
&#13;
3)   The currency, rate basis, and maturity of loan assets must be closely matched to borrowings.&#13;
&#13;
4)   Capital (paid-in capital plus retained earnings plus general loss reserves) must equal at least 30% of risk-weighted assets.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, under IFC's Articles of Agreement, as long as IFC has outstanding borrowings from the World Bank, IFC's leverage, as&#13;
measured by the ratio of IFC's debt (borrowings plus outstanding guarantees) to IFC's equity (subscribed capital plus retained&#13;
earnings), may not exceed 4.0 to 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Liquidity risk&#13;
&#13;
Within the key financial policies described above, in practice the Corporation maintains, as a prudential measure, an operating liquidity&#13;
target of not less than 70% of three years' net cash requirements, including projected disbursement and debt service requirements.&#13;
&#13;
The primary instruments for maintaining sufficient liquidity are the Corporation's liquid asset portfolios. As already noted, IFC&#13;
distinguishes four such portfolios: P0, which is generally invested in short-dated deposits reflecting its use for short-term funding&#13;
requirements; P1 and P3, which are generally invested, directly or synthetically, in floating-rate US dollar instruments; and P2, which is&#13;
generally invested in fixed-rate US dollar-denominated instruments.&#13;
&#13;
FY03 liquidity risk highlights&#13;
At June 30, 2003, the Corporation's liquidity level stood at $13.0 billion, or 107% of its projected net cash requirements for three years&#13;
($14.5 billion, and 109% at June 30, 2002).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Funding risk&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation's primary objective with respect to managing funding risk is, through the adoption of, the key financial policies&#13;
described above, to maintain its AAA credit rating and, thereby, access to funding, as required, at the lowest possible cost. Access to&#13;
funding is maximized, and cost is minimized, by issuing debt securities in various capital markets in a variety of currencies, sometimes&#13;
using complex structures. These structures include borrowings payable in multiple currencies, or borrowings with principal and/or&#13;
interest determined by reference to a specified index such as a stock market index, a reference interest rate, a commodity index, or one&#13;
or more foreign exchange rates.&#13;
&#13;
FY03 funding risk highlights&#13;
During FY03, the Corporation raised $3.5 billion of funding at sub-LIBOR rates, consistent with FY02.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Market risk&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation's exposure to market risk is minimized by adopting the matched funding policy noted above and by using a variety of&#13;
derivative instruments to convert assets and liabilities into 6-month floating rate US dollar assets and liabilities.&#13;
&#13;
Investment operations&#13;
Implementation of the matched funding policy is a two-step process: funds are earmarked at Board approval stage and matched, with&#13;
respect to interest rate and currency, at disbursement. Interest rate and currency exchange risk associated with fixed rate and/or non-&#13;
US dollar lending is hedged via currency and interest rate swaps that convert all cash flows into variable rate US dollar flows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                      13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      Exposures to market risk resulting from derivative transactions with clients, which are intended to facilitate clients' risk management, are&#13;
      minimized by entering into offsetting positions with highly rated market counterparties.&#13;
&#13;
      Liquid asset portfolios&#13;
      Consistent with the matched funding policy, the P0, P1 and P3 portfolios are strictly managed to variable rate USD dollar benchmarks,&#13;
      on a portfolio basis. To this end, a variety of derivative instruments are used, including short-term, over-the-counter foreign exchange&#13;
      forwards (covered forwards), interest rate and currency swaps, and exchange-traded interest rate futures and options. The Corporation&#13;
      also takes both long and short positions in securities in the management of these portfolios to their respective benchmarks.&#13;
&#13;
      The primary source of market risk in the liquid asset portfolios is the P2 portfolio, which, in contrast, is managed to a three-year duration&#13;
      US dollar benchmark, with additional flexibility to deviate from the benchmark. P2 represents the portion of IFC's capital not disbursed&#13;
      as equity investments, and the benchmark reflects the chosen risk profile for this uninvested capital.&#13;
&#13;
      Borrowing activities&#13;
      Market risk associated with fixed rate obligations and structured instruments entered into as part of the Corporation's funding program is&#13;
      mitigated by using derivative instruments to convert them into variable rate US dollar obligations, consistent with the matched funding&#13;
      policy.&#13;
&#13;
      Asset-liability management&#13;
      While IFC's matched-funding policy provides a significant level of protection against currency and interest rate risk, the Corporation can&#13;
      be exposed to residual market risk in its overall asset and liability management. This residual market risk is monitored by the Asset-&#13;
      Liability Management group within the Treasury Department.&#13;
&#13;
      Residual currency risk arises from events such as changes in the level of non-US dollar loan loss reserves. This risk is managed by&#13;
      monitoring the aggregate position in each lending currency and hedging the exposure when the net asset or liability position exceeds $5&#13;
      million equivalent, through spot sales or purchases.&#13;
&#13;
      Residual interest rate risk may arise from two sources:&#13;
&#13;
           Assets that are fully match-funded at inception, which can become mismatched over time due to write downs, prepayments, or&#13;
           rescheduling; and&#13;
&#13;
           Differing interest rate reset dates on assets and liabilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      This residual risk is managed, first, by synchronizing interest rate reset dates on assets and liabilities at a portfolio level; and secondly&#13;
      by measuring the sensitivity of the present value of assets and liabilities in each currency to each basis point change in interest rates,&#13;
      with a review trigger of $50,000 on this measure.&#13;
&#13;
      FY03 market risk highlights&#13;
      Currency translation gains for FY03, were $8 million ($1 million loss in FY02 and $4 million loss in FY01). Net gains on liquid asset&#13;
      trading activities were $157 million ($31 million in FY02 and $87 million in FY01), of which $136 million was attributable to the P2&#13;
      portfolio ($45 million in FY02 and $76 million in FY01).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Operational risk&#13;
&#13;
      IFC defines operational risk as the potential for loss resulting from events involving people, systems and processes. These include both&#13;
      internal and external events, whether caused by a lack of controls, documentation, or contingency planning, or by breakdowns in&#13;
      information systems, communications, physical safeguards, business continuity, supervision, transaction processing, or in the execution&#13;
      of legal, fiduciary, and agency responsibilities. As such, operational risk covers the risks emanating from the manner in which an entity&#13;
      is operated as opposed to the way it is financed.&#13;
&#13;
      Consistent with the Basel II Capital Adequacy guidelines, IFC is developing a matrix framework to analyze operational risk by&#13;
      identifying, for each area (people, systems and processes), which risks IFC will: (i) manage internally, as part of its ongoing business; (ii)&#13;
      alleviate through contingency planning; or (iii) insure externally, whether by sub-contracting, outsourcing or hedging, including&#13;
      insurance.&#13;
&#13;
      Responsibility for the development of the framework for managing and monitoring operational risk, and for contingency planning for&#13;
      recovery from emergencies, rests with the Controller's Department. In respect of insurable operational risk, IFC's Insurance Services&#13;
      Group performs insurance reviews to identify the risks and assess the adequacy of existing insurance policies and limits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IFC seeks to mitigate the risks it manages internally by maintaining a comprehensive system of internal controls that is designed not&#13;
only to identify the parameters of various risks but also to monitor and control those areas of particular concern. Key components of this&#13;
effort are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Key components of operational risk management&#13;
      The Corporation has adopted the COSO1 control framework and a control self-assessment methodology to evaluate the&#13;
      effectiveness of its internal controls in people, systems and processes, and it has an ongoing program in place to cover all&#13;
      significant business operations. In addition, the COBIT2 methodology is used to supplement the COSO review of the information&#13;
      technology function.&#13;
&#13;
      The Internal Audit Department of the World Bank Group performs on-going independent review of the effectiveness of IFC's internal&#13;
      controls in selected key areas and functions.&#13;
&#13;
      To promote data integrity, the Corporation has formulated a Data Management Policy. The policy is enforced through a network of&#13;
      Departmental Data Stewards.&#13;
      The Corporation has established a New Products/Initiatives Assessment Group, with representation from key business and support&#13;
      functions, to ensure that processes and controls are in place to manage the risks in new products and initiatives, before they are&#13;
      executed.&#13;
&#13;
1COSO refers to the Internal Control - Integrated Framework formulated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, which was&#13;
convened by the US Congress in response to the well-publicized irregularities that occurred in the financial sector during the late 1980s.&#13;
&#13;
2COBIT refers to Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology, first released in 1996, updated to the 3rd edition released in July 2000, sponsored by the&#13;
Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA).&#13;

FY03 operational risk highlights&#13;
IFC continues to focus on its preparedness to react to an emergency situation that disrupts its normal operations. During FY03, the&#13;
Corporation has:&#13;
&#13;
     extended the scope of the back-up facilities available for its key systems;&#13;
&#13;
     commenced the deployment of computing facilities to the homes of staff considered essential to maintaining key business activities&#13;
     in the event that the headquarters building becomes unavailable for use in an emergency situation; and&#13;
&#13;
     undertaken an emergency response simulation, to test the adequacy of its contingency planning and enhance the preparedness of&#13;
     its emergency management team.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation is continuing a multi-year effort to analyze and develop enhanced methodologies for measuring, monitoring and&#13;
managing operational risk in its key activities. During FY03, IFC has:&#13;
&#13;
     Adopted a more formal and analytical approach for reviewing the potential for operational risk in business;&#13;
&#13;
     Formed a team to work with relevant departments to perform an in-depth review of internal business processes and develop and&#13;
     implement operational risk management methodologies;&#13;
&#13;
     Undertaken a process mapping exercise to identify potential areas of exposure to operational risk in investment processes and&#13;
     provide a basis for quantifying potential risks; and&#13;
&#13;
     Following review by Senior Management, begun implementing recommendations from this exercise in the area of portfolio&#13;
     supervision, on a selective "proof of concept" basis for evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                                                                                                          15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      VI.        CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES&#13;
&#13;
      The Notes to the FY03 financial statements contain a summary of the Corporation's significant accounting policies, including a&#13;
      discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. Certain of these policies are considered to be "critical" to the portrayal of the&#13;
      Corporation's financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may&#13;
      relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. These policies include determining the level of the allowance for losses in the loan and&#13;
      equity investment portfolios, and valuation of certain financial instruments with no quoted market prices. Additional information about&#13;
      these policies can be found in Notes A, C and M to the FY03 financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Reserve against losses on loans and equity investments&#13;
&#13;
      The Corporation considers a loan as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Corporation will be&#13;
      unable to collect all amounts due according to the loan's contractual terms. The reserve against losses for impaired loans reflects&#13;
      management's judgment of the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. The&#13;
      Corporation establishes a reserve against losses for equity investments when a decrease in value of the investments has occurred&#13;
      which is considered other than temporary. The reserve against losses for loans and equity investments includes an estimate of probable&#13;
      losses on loans and equity investments inherent in the portfolio but not specifically identifiable. The reserve is established through&#13;
      periodic charges to income in the form of a provision for losses on loans and equity investments. Investments written off, as well as any&#13;
      subsequent recoveries, are recorded through the reserve.&#13;
&#13;
      The assessment of the adequacy of total reserves against losses for loans and equity investments is highly dependent on&#13;
      management's judgment about factors such as geographical concentration, industry, regional and macroeconomic conditions, and&#13;
      historical trends. The reserve against losses on equity investments also considers the management quality of the investee company&#13;
      and its financial condition. Due to the inherent limitation of any particular estimation technique, management utilizes three different and&#13;
      independent methods to provide estimates for the total loss reserve balance: (1) a simulation model, (2) country risk ratings and&#13;
      probability of crisis associated with those risks, and (3) a model of the Corporation's long-term historical portfolio experience. Changes&#13;
      in these estimates could have a direct impact on the provision and could result in a change in the reserve balance.&#13;
&#13;
      The reserve against losses on loans and equity investments is separately reported in the balance sheet as a deduction of the&#13;
      Corporation's total loans and equity investments. Increases or decreases in the reserve level are reported in the income statement as&#13;
      provision for losses on loans, equity investments and guarantees. The reserve against losses on loans and equity investments relates&#13;
      only to the Client Services segment of the Corporation (see Note O to the FY03 financial statements for further discussion of the&#13;
      Corporation's business segments).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Valuation of financial instruments with no quoted market prices&#13;
&#13;
      As part of its compliance with SFAS No. 133, the Corporation reports at fair value all of its derivative instruments and certain borrowings&#13;
      that the Corporation has designated as components of fair value hedges. In addition, certain features in various loan agreements,&#13;
      equity investment agreements, and borrowing contracts contain embedded derivatives that, for accounting purposes, are separately&#13;
      accounted as either derivative assets or liabilities, including puts, caps, floors, and forwards. Few of these instruments have a ready&#13;
      market valuation. Therefore, the fair values of the financial instruments with no quoted market prices are estimated using sophisticated&#13;
      pricing models of the net present value of estimated future cash flows. Management makes numerous assumptions in developing the&#13;
      pricing models, including the appropriate discount rates, interest rates, and related volatility and expected movement in foreign currency&#13;
      exchange rates. Changes in assumptions could have a significant impact on the amounts reported as assets and liabilities and the&#13;
      related gains and losses reported in the income statement. The fair value computations affect both the Client Services and Treasury&#13;
      segments of the Corporation (see Note O to the FY03 financial statements for further discussion of the Corporation's business&#13;
      segments).&#13;
&#13;
      Additional information can be found in Notes A and M to the FY03 financial statements.&#13;

VII.       RESULTS OF OPERATIONS&#13;
&#13;

The main elements of IFC's net income, and influences on the level and variability of operating and net income from year to year, are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ELEMENTS                                                         SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCES&#13;

                                                                 and the approved administrative and other budgets&#13;

                                                                 derivative instruments and changes in fair value of hedged&#13;
                                                                 items in fair value hedging relationships&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In addition, the Corporation's FY01 net income reflects the one-time impact of adopting SFAS No. 133.&#13;
&#13;
The following paragraphs detail significant variances between FY03 and FY02, and FY02 and FY01, covering the periods included in&#13;
the Corporation's FY03 financial statements. As disclosed in Note A to the Corporation's FY03 financial statements, certain amounts in&#13;
FY02 and FY01 have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on operating&#13;
income, net income or total assets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FY03 versus FY02&#13;
&#13;
Operating income&#13;
The Corporation's operating income for FY03 was $528 million, substantially higher than FY02 operating income of $161 million. The&#13;
improvement was mainly attributable to the significant reduction in the charge for provisions for losses on loans, equity investments and&#13;
guarantees (provisions) and significantly higher net gains on the Corporation's liquid asset trading activities. Offsetting these favorable&#13;
contributions to higher operating income in FY03, as compared with FY02, were lower realized capital gains on equity sales and higher&#13;
expense from the Corporation's pension and other postretirement benefit plans (pension expense).&#13;
&#13;
The lower charge for provisions reflected the stabilization and subsequent marginal improvement in the loan and equity investment&#13;
portfolio quality in FY03. Provisions in FY02 reflected the declining portfolio quality, principally in Argentina, one of the Corporation's&#13;
largest portfolio countries. Provisions totaled $98 million in FY03, as compared with $657 million in FY02.&#13;
&#13;
The overall declining interest rate environment in FY03 continued to benefit the Corporation's returns from its liquid asset portfolios, in&#13;
particular the P2 portfolio which is a largely fixed income portfolio. Gains on the Corporation's liquid asset trading activities in FY03&#13;
were $157 million, as compared to $31 million in FY02.&#13;
&#13;
Realized capital gains in FY03 were $52 million, as compared with $288 million in FY02. The significant gains in FY02 were principally&#13;
due to targeted sales of a small number of equity investments in certain emerging markets that had reached pre-determined sales&#13;
trigger levels.&#13;
&#13;
Pension expense in FY03 was $24 million, as compared with pension income in FY02 of $31 million.&#13;
&#13;
Net interest income&#13;
IFC's primary interest earning assets are its loan portfolio and its liquid assets portfolios. After charges on borrowings are taken into&#13;
account, net interest income decreased by $33 million or 5% from $602 million in FY02 to $569 million in FY03.&#13;
&#13;
Interest, commitment and financial fees from loans (including guarantee fees) for FY03 were $477 million, compared with $547&#13;
million in FY02, a decrease of 13%. Interest income declined from $486 million in FY02 to $414 million in FY03, principally reflecting&#13;
the overall decline in interest rates during FY03. While the disbursed and outstanding loan portfolio grew by 15%, loans in nonaccrual&#13;
status grew from $1,217 million at June 30, 2002 to $1,543 million at June 30, 2003, an increase of 27%. Recoveries of interest on loans&#13;
being removed from non-accrual status, net of reversals of income on loans being placed in nonaccrual status were $23 million in FY03&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                               17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      ($27 million ­ FY02). Income from the Corporation's participation notes, over and above minimum contractual interest, totaled $33&#13;
      million in FY03 ($36 million ­ FY02). In addition, as discussed in Note E to the FY03 financial statements, the Corporation recorded&#13;
      nonrecurring income of $15 million in FY02, included in interest and financial fees from loans, as a result of exercising an option to&#13;
      reacquire the remaining outstanding loan participations owned by a trust, and the subsequent dissolution of the trust. Commitment and&#13;
      financial fees, however, grew from $61 million in FY02 to $63 million in FY03 reflecting the Corporation's strong commitments and&#13;
      disbursements in the past year.&#13;
&#13;
      Interest income from time deposits and securities for FY03 was $318 million, $175 million lower than the $493 million recorded in&#13;
      FY02.&#13;
&#13;
      The liquid assets portfolio, net of derivatives and securities lending activities, decreased from $14.5 billion at June 30, 2002, to $13.0&#13;
      billion at June 30, 2003, largely due to loan and equity disbursements and sales of equity securities exceeding repayments and&#13;
      redemptions by $1.3 billion and repayments of the Corporation's borrowings exceeding drawdowns by $0.3 billion. The $1.5 billion&#13;
      decline in the liquid assets portfolio combined with the reduced yields due to the overall declining interest rate environment contributed&#13;
      to the reduction in interest income from time deposits and securities from FY02 to FY03.&#13;
&#13;
      The Corporation's charges on borrowings decreased by $212 million from $438 million in FY02 to $226 million in FY03, largely&#13;
      reflecting the declining US dollar interest rate environment, as the weighted average cost of the Corporation's borrowings outstanding&#13;
      from market sources, after the effects of borrowing-related derivatives fell from 1.8% at June 30, 2002 to 0.9% at June 30, 2003. The&#13;
      borrowings portfolio, net of borrowing-related derivatives, decreased by $0.8 billion in FY03 from $16.7 billion at June 30, 2002, to $15.9&#13;
      billion at June 30, 2003.&#13;
&#13;
      Net gains and losses on trading activities&#13;
      Due to the continuing overall decline in the US dollar interest rate environment throughout FY02, and the favorable impact of this decline&#13;
      on the carrying value of the Corporation's fixed income liquid asset investments, the Corporation recorded net realized and unrealized&#13;
      gains on its liquid asset portfolios of $157 million, higher than the net realized and unrealized gains of $31 million recorded in FY02.&#13;
&#13;
      Income from equity investments&#13;
      Overall income from the equity investment portfolio declined by $233 million from $428 million in FY02 to $195 million in FY03.&#13;
&#13;
      The Corporation generated capital gains for FY03 of $52 million as compared with $288 million for FY02, a decrease of $236 million or&#13;
      82%. Capital gains in FY02 were highly concentrated with $227 million of the total capital gains of $288 million resulting from sales or&#13;
      partial sales of six equity investments in Korea, Mexico, Peru, and Latvia. Such opportunities for sales based on pre-determined trigger&#13;
      levels did not recur to a significant extent in FY03 with only one sale of an equity investment generating a capital gain in excess of $5&#13;
      million. Dividend income was marginally higher in FY03 at $143 million, as compared with $140 million in FY02. Consistent with FY02,&#13;
      the stable performance in dividend income in FY03 was largely attributable to returns on the Corporation's joint ventures in the oil, gas&#13;
      and mining sectors.&#13;
&#13;
      Provisions for losses on loans, equity investments and guarantees&#13;
      The income charge for provisions for losses of $98 million in FY03, including $1 million in respect of guarantees, was significantly lower&#13;
      than the charge in FY02 of $657 million (which included $16 million in respect of guarantees), a decline of $559 million. On June 30,&#13;
      2003, the Corporation's total reserves against losses on loans and equity investments were 21.9% of the disbursed and outstanding&#13;
      portfolio (25.8% at June 30, 2002). The significantly lower income charge in FY03 reflected the stabilization of the portfolio quality in the&#13;
      first quarter of FY03 and a marginal improvement in portfolio quality during the last nine months of the year.&#13;
&#13;
      Noninterest income&#13;
      Noninterest income of $93 million for FY03 was $11 million higher than in FY02 ($82 million), principally due to higher service fees -&#13;
      $51 million in FY03, as compared with $40 million in FY02. The increase was largely due to the recovery of $11 million of overdue&#13;
      interest and penalties received from one of the Corporation's client risk management derivatives to a client in the power sector.&#13;
&#13;
      Noninterest expense&#13;
      Administrative expenses (the principal component of noninterest expense) marginally increased by 2% from $327 million in FY02 to&#13;
      $332 million in FY03. Administrative expenses include the grossing-up effect of certain revenues and expenses attributable to the&#13;
      Corporation's reimbursable program ($30 million in FY03, as compared with $39 million in FY02), and the impact of a reorganization&#13;
      effected in FY02 ($nil million in FY03, as compared with $13 million in FY02).&#13;
&#13;
      FY02 administrative expenses were impacted by a series of efficiency and effectiveness measures implemented in the second half of&#13;
      FY02. These measures were taken as part of IFC's overall reorganization and also to address the impact on operating income of the&#13;
      emerging crisis in Argentina. Administrative expenses in FY02 included a charge of $13 million for the reorganization, which involved&#13;
      staff reductions, field office closings and reorganizations, and a headquarters reorganization. The reorganization was finalized and&#13;
      announced in the fourth quarter of FY02, and the implementation of the plan was substantially completed in FY03.&#13;
&#13;
      The Corporation recorded expense from pension and other postretirement benefit plans in FY03 of $24 million, as compared with&#13;
      income of $31 million in FY02. The increase in expense was due to changes in the underlying actuarial assumptions related to the&#13;
      calculation of pension expense, and a decrease in the value of the pension assets during FY02.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Net income&#13;
As more fully disclosed in Notes A, L and M to the Corporation's FY03 financial statements, the Corporation changed its method of&#13;
accounting for derivative instruments to conform with SFAS No. 133 beginning in FY01. Pursuant to SFAS No. 133, the Corporation&#13;
has designated certain hedging relationships in its borrowing activities and its lending activities as fair value hedges. The Corporation&#13;
generally matches the terms of its derivatives with the terms of the specific underlying financial instruments hedged, in terms of&#13;
currencies, maturity dates, reset dates, interest rates, and other features. However, differing valuation methodologies are applied to the&#13;
derivative and the hedged financial instrument, as prescribed by SFAS No. 133. The resulting ineffectiveness calculated for such&#13;
relationships is recorded in other unrealized gains on financial instruments in net income.&#13;
&#13;
The effects of SFAS No. 133 on net income FY03 and FY02 can be summarized as follows (US$ millions):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                      FY03          FY02&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                       528           161&#13;

                                                                                                       487           215&#13;
            Net income&#13;
&#13;
Other unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments largely comprises the difference between the change in fair value of&#13;
derivative instruments and the change in fair value of the hedged item under designated hedging relationships.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FY02 versus FY01&#13;
&#13;
Operating income&#13;
The Corporation's operating income for FY02 was $161 million, substantially lower than FY01's operating income of $241 million. The&#13;
decline was mainly attributable to the significant charge for provisions for losses on loans, equity investments and guarantees, which&#13;
reflected the downturn in portfolio quality in FY02, principally in Argentina, one of the Corporation's largest portfolio countries. Such&#13;
provisions totaled $657 million in FY02 as compared with $402 million in FY01. Capital gains on equity sales partially offset the negative&#13;
effect on operating income of such provisions. FY02 capital gains were $288 million as compared with $91 million in FY01 due to&#13;
targeted sales of a small number of equity investments in certain markets that had reached pre-determined sales trigger levels.&#13;
&#13;
Net interest income&#13;
IFC's primary interest earning assets are its loan portfolio and its liquid assets portfolios. After charges on borrowings are taken into&#13;
account, net interest income improved by $58 million or 11% from $544 million in FY01 to $602 million in FY02.&#13;
&#13;
Interest and financial fees (including guarantee fees) for FY02 were $547 million, compared with $732 million for FY01, a decrease&#13;
of 25%. The disbursed and outstanding loan portfolio declined marginally by 2%, and the Corporation's nonperforming loan rate was&#13;
higher in FY02 than in FY01. Loans in nonaccrual status grew from $1,054 million at June 30, 2001 to $1,217 million at June 30, 2002,&#13;
an increase of 15%. Interest and financial fees benefited in FY02 from net recoveries of interest on loans in nonaccrual status, related to&#13;
current and prior years of $39 million ($27 million ­ FY01). In addition, as discussed in Note E to the FY03 financial statements, the&#13;
Corporation recorded income of $15 million in FY02, included in interest and financial fees from loans, as a result of exercising an option&#13;
to reacquire the remaining outstanding loan participations owned by a trust, and the subsequent dissolution of the trust.&#13;
&#13;
Interest income from time deposits and securities for FY02 was $493 million, $280 million lower than the $773 million recorded in&#13;
FY01. The liquid assets portfolio, net of derivatives and securities lending activities, grew from $13.3 billion at June 30, 2001, to $14.5&#13;
billion, largely funded by the growth in the Corporation's borrowings program, proceeds from sales of equity securities and the slower&#13;
pace of loan and equity disbursements experienced in FY02, continuing the trend experienced in FY01. The $1.2 billion growth in the&#13;
liquid assets portfolio partially offset the negative effect of the overall declining interest rate environment experienced in FY02 on interest&#13;
income from time deposits and securities.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation's charges on borrowings fell by $523 million during FY02 from $961 million to $438 million, largely reflecting the&#13;
declining US dollar interest rate environment, partially offset by the growth of the borrowings portfolio. After the effect of associated&#13;
derivative financial instruments, the borrowings portfolio grew by $0.3 billion in FY02 from $16.6 billion at June 30, 2001, to $16.9 billion&#13;
at June 30, 2002.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Net gains and losses on trading activities&#13;
Due to the overall decline in the US dollar interest rate environment in FY02, and the favorable impact of this decline on the carrying&#13;
value of the Corporation's fixed income liquid asset investments, the Corporation recorded net realized and unrealized gains on its liquid&#13;
asset portfolios of $31 million, lower than the net realized and unrealized gains of $87 million recorded in FY01 which was characterized&#13;
by a steeper declining interest rate environment than experienced in FY02.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                   19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      Income from equity investments&#13;
      Overall income from the equity investment portfolio was higher by $206 million, or 93%, from $222 million in FY01 to $428 million in&#13;
      FY02.&#13;
&#13;
      The Corporation generated capital gains for FY02 of $288 million as compared with $91 million for FY01, an increase of 216%. Capital&#13;
      gains, while strong in FY02, were highly concentrated with $227 million of the total capital gains of $288 million resulting from sales or&#13;
      partial sales of six equity investments in Korea, Mexico, Peru, and Latvia. Dividend income was marginally higher in FY02 at $140&#13;
      million, as compared with $131 million in FY01. Consistent with FY01, the stable performance in dividend income in FY02 was largely&#13;
      attributable to returns on the Corporation's joint ventures in the oil, gas and mining sectors.&#13;
&#13;
      Provisions for losses on loans, equity investments and guarantees&#13;
      The income charge for provisions for losses of $657 million in FY02, including $16 million in respect of guarantees, was significantly&#13;
      higher than the charge in FY01 of $402 million (which included $13 million in respect of guarantees), a growth of $255 million or 63%.&#13;
      On June 30, 2002, the Corporation's total reserves against losses on loans and equity investments were 25.8% of the disbursed and&#13;
      outstanding portfolio (20.3% at June 30, 2001).&#13;
&#13;
      Noninterest income&#13;
      Noninterest income of $82 million for FY02 was $17 million higher than in FY01 ($65 million), principally due to other income, principally&#13;
      fees collected from clients for reimbursement of expenses incurred by the Corporation, of $43 million in FY02 being $15 million higher&#13;
      than in FY01 ($28 million). Service fees in FY02 were substantially unchanged at $40 million, as compared with $41 million in FY01.&#13;
&#13;
      Noninterest expense&#13;
      Administrative expenses (the principal component of noninterest expense) rose 8% from $304 million in FY01 to $327 million in FY02.&#13;
      Excluding the grossing-up effect of certain revenues and expenses attributable to the Corporation's reimbursable program ($39 million in&#13;
      FY02, as compared with $24 million in FY01) as noted above, and the impact of a reorganization effected in FY02 ($13 million in FY02,&#13;
      as compared with $nil in FY01), administrative expenses, the largest component of noninterest expense, fell by $5 million, from $280&#13;
      million in FY01, to $275 million in FY02. This decrease was largely attributable to the effect of a series of efficiency and effectiveness&#13;
      measures implemented in the second half of FY02.&#13;
&#13;
      Income from the Corporation's pension and other postretirement benefit plans (recorded as a reduction in administrative expenses in&#13;
      FY02 and FY01 in the Corporation's FY03 financial statements due to the FY03 presentation in noninterest expense) fell by $16 million&#13;
      from $47 million in FY01 to $31 million in FY02.&#13;
&#13;
      Net income&#13;

VIII.       GOVERNANCE&#13;
&#13;
Board of Directors&#13;
&#13;
In accordance with its Articles of Agreement, members of IFC's Board of Directors (the Board) are appointed or elected by their member&#13;
governments. These Directors are neither officers nor staff of IFC. James D. Wolfensohn, President, is the only management member of&#13;
the Board, serving as a non-voting member and as Chairman of the Board. The Board has established several Committees including:&#13;
&#13;
      Committee on Development Effectiveness&#13;
      Audit Committee&#13;
      Budget Committee&#13;
      Personnel Committee&#13;
      Committee on Governance and Administrative Matters&#13;
&#13;
The Board and its Committees function in continuous session at the principal offices of the World Bank Group, as business requires.&#13;
Each Committee's terms of reference establish its respective roles and responsibilities. As Committees do not vote, their role is primarily&#13;
to serve the full Board in discharging its responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Audit Committee&#13;
&#13;
Membership&#13;
The Audit Committee consists of eight members of the Board. Membership on the Committee is determined by the Board, based upon&#13;
nominations by the Chairman of the Board, following informal consultation with the Directors. Membership of the Committee is expected&#13;
to reflect the economic and geographic diversity of IFC's member countries, as well as the seniority, and relevant experience of each&#13;
member. Generally, Committee members are appointed for a two year term; reappointment to a second term, when possible, is&#13;
desirable for continuity. Audit Committee meetings are generally open to any members of the Board who may wish to attend, and non-&#13;
Committee members of the Board may participate in discussions. In addition, the Chairman of the Audit Committee may speak in that&#13;
capacity at meetings of the Board with respect to discussions held in the Audit Committee.&#13;
&#13;
Key responsibilities&#13;
The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board to exercise, on its behalf, oversight and assessment of fiduciary controls, the&#13;
effectiveness of financial reporting, various aspects of financial, business, operating, and reputational risk, quality of earnings, and&#13;
internal controls. In the execution of this role, the Committee discusses with management and the external auditors financial issues and&#13;
policies that have an important bearing on the Corporation's financial position and risk-bearing capacity. It also reviews the internal audit&#13;
work program with the Auditor General and Management of the Corporation.&#13;
&#13;
Communications&#13;
The Audit Committee communicates regularly with the Board through distribution of the following:&#13;
&#13;
      The minutes of its meetings&#13;
      Reports of the Audit Committee prepared by the Chairman, which document discussions held. These Reports are distributed to the&#13;
      Directors, Alternates, World Bank Group Senior Management and Vice Presidents of IFC.&#13;
      "Statement(s) of the Chairman" and statements issued by other members of the Committee.&#13;
      The Annual Report of the Board, which provides an overview of the main issues addressed by the Audit Committee over the year.&#13;
&#13;
The Audit Committee's communications with the external auditor are described in the Auditor Independence section, below.&#13;
&#13;
Executive sessions&#13;
Members of the Audit Committee may convene in executive session at any time, without management present. Under the Audit&#13;
Committee's terms of reference, it meets in executive session with the external auditors at least once a year.&#13;
&#13;
Access to outside resources and to management&#13;
Throughout the year, the Audit Committee receives a large volume of information, that supports the preparation of the financial&#13;
statements. The Audit Committee meets both formally and informally throughout the year to discuss financial and accounting matters.&#13;
Directors have complete access to management of the Corporation. The quarterly and annual financial statements are made available&#13;
to the Audit Committee for discussion prior to issuance. The Audit Committee has the opportunity to meet with both management and&#13;
the external auditors for bilateral discussions. The Audit Committee then meets to discuss the financial statements with management&#13;
and the external auditors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Code of Ethics&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank Group strives to foster and maintain a positive work environment that supports the ethical behavior of its staff. To&#13;
facilitate this effort, the Bank Group has in place a Code of Professional Ethics ­ living our values. The Code applies to all staff&#13;
(including managers, consultants, and temporary employees) worldwide.&#13;
&#13;
The Code is available on the Bank Group's website, www.worldbank.org. Staff relations, conflicts of interest, and operational issues,&#13;
including the accuracy of books and records, are key elements of the Code.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                 21&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      In addition to the Code, an essential element of appropriate conduct is compliance with the obligations embodied in the Principles of&#13;
      Staff Employment, Staff Rules, and Administrative Rules, the violation of which may result in disciplinary actions. In accordance with the&#13;
      Staff Rules, senior managers must complete a confidential financial disclosure instrument with the Office of Ethics and Business&#13;
      Conduct.&#13;
&#13;
      Guidance for staff is also provided through programs, training materials, and other resources. Managers are responsible for ensuring&#13;
      that internal systems, policies, and procedures are consistently aligned with the World Bank Group's ethical goals. In support of its&#13;
      efforts on ethics, the World Bank offers a variety of methods for informing staff of these resources. Many of these efforts are headed by&#13;
      the following groups:&#13;
            The Office of Ethics and Business Conduct provides leadership, management and oversight for the Bank Group's ethics&#13;
            infrastructure including the Ethics HelpLine, a consolidated conflicts of interest disclosure/resolution system, financial disclosure,&#13;
            ongoing training to both internal and external audiences, and communication resources.&#13;
            The Department of Institutional Integrity is charged with investigating allegations of fraud and corruption with the Bank Group. The&#13;
            Department also investigates allegations of misconduct by Bank Group staff, and trains and educates staff and clients in detecting&#13;
            and reporting fraud and corruption in Bank Group-funded projects. The Department reports directly to the President and is&#13;
            composed of professionals from a range of disciplines including financial analysts, researchers, investigators, lawyers, prosecutors,&#13;
            forensic accountants, and Bank Group staff with operational experience.&#13;
&#13;
      The Bank Group offers both an "Ethics HelpLine", as well as a Fraud and Corruption hotline run by an outside firm staffed by trained&#13;
      specialists. The third party service offers numerous methods of communication in addition to a toll free hotline in countries where access&#13;
      to telecommunications may be limited. In addition there are other methods by which the Department of Institutional Integrity may receive&#13;
      allegations, including directly by email, anonymously, or through confidential submission through their website, as well as the postal&#13;
      service and telephone.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Auditor Independence&#13;
&#13;
      In February 2003, the Board adopted a set of principles applicable to the appointment of the external auditor for IFC. Key features of&#13;
      those principles include:&#13;
&#13;
            An immediate prohibition of the external auditor from the provision of all non audit-related services.&#13;
            All audit-related services must be pre-approved on a case-by-case basis by the Board, upon recommendation of the Audit&#13;
            Committee.&#13;
            Mandatory rebidding of the external audit contract every five years.&#13;
            Prohibition of any firm serving as external auditor for more than two consecutive five-year terms.&#13;
            Mandatory rotation of the senior partner after five years.&#13;
            An evaluation of the performance of the external auditor at the mid-point of the five year term.&#13;
&#13;
      IFC's external auditor is commencing a new term of up to five years as of the year ending June 30, 2004, and will have served eleven&#13;
      years as external auditor upon completion of that term, pursuant to a one-time grandfathered exemption from the above-referenced ten-&#13;
      year limit. The service of the external auditors is subject to recommendation by the Audit Committee for annual reappointment and&#13;
      approval of a resolution by the Board.&#13;
&#13;
      As a standard practice, the external auditor is present as an observer at virtually all Audit Committee meetings and is frequently asked&#13;
      to present its perspective on issues. In addition, the Audit Committee meets periodically with the external auditor in private session&#13;
      without management present. Members of the Audit Committee have independent access to the external auditor. Communication&#13;
      between the external auditor and the Audit Committee is ongoing, as frequently as is deemed necessary by either party. IFC's external&#13;
      auditors follow the communication requirements with audit committees set out under U.S. generally accepted auditing standards. In&#13;
      keeping with these standards, significant formal communications include:&#13;
&#13;
            quarterly and annual financial statement reporting,&#13;
            annual appointment of the external auditors,&#13;
            presentation of the external audit plan,&#13;
            presentation of control recommendations and discussion of the COSO attestation and report, and&#13;
            presentation of a statement regarding independence.&#13;
&#13;
      In addition, there is informal communication between the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the external auditor's lead client service&#13;
      partner.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
       INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION&#13;
       Washington, DC&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                          July 31, 2003&#13;
&#13;
       RESPONSIBILITY FOR EXTERNAL FINANCIAL REPORTING&#13;
&#13;
       The external financial statements and related financial information in the IFC annual report, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003, were prepared by the&#13;
       management of IFC.In doing so,management applied generally accepted accounting principles in the United States,and also exercised its judgement and&#13;
       made estimates in those instances where they were deemed appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       In assuming its responsibility both for the integrity and fairness of financial information, management maintains a system of internal controls designed to&#13;
       provide reasonable assurance to the Board of Executive Directors and member countries that assets are safeguarded,transactions are properly executed and&#13;
       recorded in accordance with management's authorizations, and accounting records are reliable for preparing accurate, published financial statements.&#13;
       Management uses its judgement balancing the costs of systems of internal accounting controls and the benefits to be derived from them.The systems of&#13;
       internal accounting controls are continually modified and improved in response to changes in business conditions and operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Key procedures that management has established and which are designed to provide effective internal financial control within the IFC include the prepa-&#13;
       ration, review and Board approval of annual financial plans that align with strategic plans prepared every year. Results are monitored regularly and reports&#13;
       on progress compared to the plan are prepared quarterly. Additionally, systems are in place to monitor financial risks such as changes in the market prices&#13;
       of financial instruments, funding of assets, operational error and fraud. Exposure to these risks is monitored by the IFC Finance and Risk Committee.1&#13;
       Further,the system of internal controls includes written policies and procedures,proper delegation of authority,accountability through establishing respon-&#13;
       sibility centers, and segregation of duties.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       The effectiveness of IFC's systems of internal accounting controls is monitored throughout the year by management in its ongoing oversight role,through&#13;
       the conduct of control risk self assessments, and by an established program of internal audit carried out by the World Bank Group Internal Auditing&#13;
       Department. Management believes that IFC's internal controls for external financial reporting, which are subject to close scrutiny by management and by&#13;
       internal auditors and are revised as considered necessary, support the integrity and reliability of the external financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Further, the external financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2003, were audited by external auditors who, in the course of their work, consid-&#13;
       ered the internal control structure to obtain an understanding of it sufficient to plan the audit and to determine the nature, timing, and extent of audit&#13;
       procedures performed. However, an audit is not designed to provide assurance on the internal control system or to identify reportable conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       The Board of Directors of IFC has appointed an Audit Committee responsible for monitoring the accounting practices and internal controls of the&#13;
       Corporation.The Audit Committee meets periodically with management and our internal auditors to discuss the work of each. Both the internal audi-&#13;
       tors and the external auditors have direct access to the Audit Committee to discuss the audits and any accounting controls or financial accounting and&#13;
       reporting matters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Even an effective internal control system, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations ­ including the possibility of the circumvention or over-&#13;
       riding of controls ­ and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to external financial statement preparation. Further, because of&#13;
       changes in conditions, internal control system effectiveness may vary over time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       IFC assessed its internal control system as of June 30, 2003, in relation to criteria for effective internal control over external financial reporting described&#13;
       in Internal Control ­ Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of theTreadway Commission.Based on this&#13;
       assessment, IFC believes that, as of June 30, 2003, its system of internal control over external financial reporting met those criteria.&#13;

PURPOSE&#13;
&#13;
The International Finance Corporation (the Corporation), an international organization, was established in 1956 to further economic development&#13;
in its member countries by encouraging the growth of private enterprise. The Corporation is a member of the World Bank Group, which also&#13;
includes the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association, and the Multilateral&#13;
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). The Corporation's activities are closely coordinated with and complement the overall development&#13;
objectives of the other World Bank Group institutions. The Corporation, together with private investors, assists in financing the establishment,&#13;
improvement and expansion of private sector enterprises by making loans and equity investments where sufficient private capital is not&#13;
otherwise available on reasonable terms. The Corporation's share capital is provided by its member countries. It raises most of the funds for its&#13;
investment activities through the issuance of notes, bonds and other debt securities in the international capital markets. The Corporation also&#13;
plays a catalytic role in mobilizing additional project funding from other investors and lenders, either through cofinancing or through loan&#13;
syndications, underwritings and guarantees. In addition to project finance and resource mobilization, the Corporation offers an array of financial&#13;
and technical advisory services to private businesses in the developing world to increase their chances of success. It also advises governments&#13;
on how to create an environment hospitable to the growth of private enterprise and foreign investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE A ­ SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES&#13;
&#13;
The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America&#13;
(US GAAP). On July 31, 2003, the Board of Directors of the Corporation approved these financial statements for issue.&#13;
&#13;
Financial statements presentation - Certain amounts in the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.&#13;
&#13;
Use of estimates - The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the&#13;
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the&#13;
reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A significant degree of&#13;
judgment has been used in the determination of: the adequacy of the reserve against losses on loans and equity investments; estimated fair&#13;
values of all derivative instruments and related financial instruments in qualifying hedging relationships; and net periodic pension income. There&#13;
are inherent risks and uncertainties related to the Corporation's operations. The possibility exists that changing economic conditions could have&#13;
an adverse effect on the financial position of the Corporation.&#13;
&#13;
As part of the ongoing compliance with US Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments&#13;
and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivatives and Certain Hedging Relationships (collectively SFAS&#13;
No. 133), the Corporation uses internal models to determine the fair values of derivative and other financial instruments and the aggregate level&#13;
of the reserve against losses on loans and equity investments. The Corporation undertakes continuous review and respecification of these&#13;
models with the objective of refining its estimates, consistent with evolving best market practices. Changes in estimates resulting from&#13;
refinements in the assumptions and methodologies incorporated in the models are reflected in net income in the period in which the enhanced&#13;
models are first applied.&#13;
&#13;
Translation of currencies - Assets and liabilities not denominated in United States dollars (US dollars or $), other than disbursed equity&#13;
investments, are expressed in US dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at June 30, 2003 and June 30, 2002. Disbursed equity investments&#13;
are expressed in US dollars at the prevailing exchange rates at the time of disbursement. Income and expenses are translated at the rates of&#13;
exchange prevailing at the time of the transaction. Translation gains and losses are credited or charged to income.&#13;
&#13;
Loans and equity investments - Loans and equity investments are recorded as assets when disbursed. Loans are carried at the principal&#13;
amounts outstanding. Where loans are part of a designated hedging relationship employing derivative instruments, the carrying value is&#13;
adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged. These adjustments are reported in other unrealized gains and losses on&#13;
financial instruments in net income. It is the Corporation's practice to obtain collateral security such as, but not limited to, mortgages and third-&#13;
party guarantees. Equity investments are carried at cost. The Corporation enters into put and call option agreements in connection with equity&#13;
investments; these are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No.133.&#13;
&#13;
Reserve against losses on loans and equity investments - The Corporation recognizes portfolio impairment in the balance sheet through&#13;
the reserve against losses on loans and equity investments, recording a provision or release of provision for losses on loans and equity&#13;
investments in net income on a quarterly basis, which increases or decreases the reserve against losses on loans and equity investments.&#13;
&#13;
Management determines the aggregate level of the reserve against losses on loans and equity investments, taking into account established&#13;
guidelines and its assessment of recent portfolio quality trends. The guidelines comprise simulation techniques, internal country risk ratings and&#13;
the impairment potential of the portfolio based on the Corporation's historical portfolio write-off and loss reserve experience on mature&#13;
investments.&#13;
&#13;
The reserve against losses on loans and equity investments reflects estimates of both probable losses already identified and probable losses&#13;
inherent in the portfolio but not specifically identifiable. The determination of identified probable losses represents management's judgment of&#13;
the creditworthiness of the borrower or the value of the company invested in and is established through review of individual loans and equity&#13;
investments undertaken on a quarterly basis. The Corporation considers a loan as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is&#13;
probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the loan's contractual terms. A reserve against losses for an&#13;
equity investment is established when a decrease in value of the equity investment has occurred which is considered other than temporary.&#13;
Unidentified probable losses are the aggregate probable losses over a one-year risk horizon, in excess of identified probable losses. The risks&#13;
inherent in the portfolio that are considered in determining unidentified probable losses are those proven to exist by past experience and include:&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                                                                                         31&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                                                                   Page 7&#13;

&#13;
      country systemic risk; the risk of correlation or contagion of losses between markets; uninsured and uninsurable risks; nonperformance under&#13;
      guarantees and support agreements; and opacity of, or misrepresentation in, financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
      Loan and Equity investments are written-off when the Corporation has exhausted all possible means of recovery, by reducing the reserve&#13;
      against losses on loans and equity investments. Such reductions in the reserve are offset by recoveries associated with previously written-off&#13;
      loans and equity investments.&#13;
&#13;
      Revenue recognition on loans and equity investments - Interest income and commitment fees on loans are recorded as income on an&#13;
      accrual basis. All other fees are recorded as income when received in freely convertible currencies. The Corporation does not recognize&#13;
      income on loans where collectibility is in doubt or payments of interest or principal are past due more than 60 days unless management&#13;
      anticipates that collection of interest will occur in the near future. Any interest accrued on a loan placed in nonaccrual status is reversed out of&#13;
      income and is thereafter recognized as income only when the actual payment is received. Interest not previously recognized but capitalized as&#13;
      part of a debt restructuring is recorded as deferred income, included in the balance sheet in payables and other liabilities, and credited to income&#13;
      only when the related principal is received. Such capitalized interest is considered in the computation of the reserve against losses on loans and&#13;
      equity investments in the balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
      Dividends and profit participations are recorded as income when received in freely convertible currencies. Capital gains on the sale or&#13;
      redemption of equity investments are measured against the average cost of the investments sold and are recorded as income when received in&#13;
      freely convertible currencies.&#13;
&#13;
      Certain equity investments, for which recovery of invested capital is uncertain are accounted for under the cost recovery method, such that&#13;
      receipts of freely convertible currencies are first applied to recovery of invested capital and then to capital gains.&#13;
&#13;
      Guarantees ­ The Corporation extends financial guarantee facilities to its clients to provide credit enhancement for their debt securities and&#13;
      trade obligations. Beginning in the year ended June 30, 2001, the Corporation began offering partial credit guarantees to clients covering, on a&#13;
      risk-sharing basis, client obligations on bonds and/or loans. Under the terms of the Corporation's guarantees, the Corporation agrees to assume&#13;
      responsibility for the client's financial obligations in the event of default by the client (i.e., failure to pay when payment is due). Guarantees are&#13;
      regarded as issued when the Corporation commits to the guarantee. This date is also the "inception" of the guarantee contract. Guarantees are&#13;
      regarded as outstanding when the underlying financial obligation of the client is incurred, and called when the Corporation's obligation under the&#13;
      guarantee has been invoked. There are two liabilities associated with the guarantees: (1) the stand-ready obligation to perform and (2) the&#13;
      contingent liability. The stand-ready obligation to perform is recognized at the commitment date unless a contingent liability exists at that time or&#13;
      is expected to exist in the near term. The contingent liability associated with the financial guarantees is recognized when it is probable the&#13;
      guarantee will be called and when the amount of guarantee called can be reasonably estimated. All liabilities associated with guarantees are&#13;
      included in payables and other liabilities, and the receivables are included in other assets on the balance sheet. When the guarantees are&#13;
      called, the amount disbursed is recorded as a new loan, and specific reserves are established, based on the estimated probable loss. These&#13;
      reserves are included in the reserve against losses on loans and equity investments on the balance sheet. Commitment fees on guarantees are&#13;
      recorded as income on an accrual basis.&#13;
&#13;
      Liquid asset portfolio - The Corporation's liquid funds are invested in government and agency obligations, time deposits and asset-backed&#13;
      securities. Government and agency obligations include long and short positions in highly rated fixed rate bonds, notes, bills and other&#13;
      obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of countries or other official entities including government agencies and&#13;
      instrumentalities or by multilateral organizations. The liquid asset portfolio, as defined by the Corporation and as detailed in note B, comprises:&#13;
      these time deposits and securities; related derivative instruments; securities purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under&#13;
      repurchase agreements and payable for cash collateral received; receivables from sales of securities and payables for purchases of securities;&#13;
      and related accrued income and charges.&#13;
&#13;
      On July 1, 2000, the Corporation reclassified all of its available for sale securities as trading securities. This resulted in a transfer of&#13;
      accumulated net unrealized holding losses on available for sale securities of $5 million from other comprehensive income to net income in the&#13;
      year ended June 30, 2001. Beginning with the year ended June 30, 2001, realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are&#13;
      reported separately in the income statement.&#13;
&#13;
      Trading securities are carried at fair value with any changes in fair value reported in net gains and losses on trading activities. Interest on&#13;
      securities and amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are reported in interest from time deposits and securities.&#13;
&#13;
      The Corporation classifies due from banks, time deposits and securities (collectively, cash and cash equivalents) as an element of liquidity in the&#13;
      statement of cash flows because they are readily convertible to known amounts of cash within 90 days.&#13;
&#13;
      Repurchase and resale agreements - Repurchase agreements are contracts under which a party sells securities and simultaneously agrees&#13;
      to repurchase the same securities at a specified future date at a fixed price. Resale agreements are contracts under which a party purchases&#13;
      securities and simultaneously agrees to resell the same securities at a specified future date at a fixed price.&#13;
&#13;
      It is the Corporation's policy to take possession of securities purchased under resale agreements, which are primarily liquid government&#13;
      securities. The market value of these securities is monitored and, within parameters defined in the agreements, additional collateral is obtained&#13;
      when their value declines. The Corporation also monitors its exposure with respect to securities sold under repurchase agreements and, in&#13;
      accordance with the terms of the agreements, requests the return of excess securities held by the counterparty when their value increases.&#13;
&#13;
      Repurchase and resale agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded at the amount at which the&#13;
      securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. Securities purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under agreements to&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
repurchase and securities payable for cash collateral received are recorded at fair value.&#13;
&#13;
Borrowings - To diversify its access to funding and reduce its borrowing costs, the Corporation borrows in a variety of currencies and uses a&#13;
number of borrowing structures, including foreign exchange rate-linked, inverse floating rate and zero coupon notes. Generally, the Corporation&#13;
simultaneously converts such borrowings into variable rate US dollar borrowings through the use of currency and interest rate swap&#13;
transactions. Under certain outstanding borrowing agreements, the Corporation is not permitted to mortgage or allow a lien to be placed on its&#13;
assets (other than purchase money security interests) without extending equivalent security to the holders of such borrowings.&#13;
&#13;
Borrowings are recorded at the amount repayable at maturity, adjusted for unamortized premium and unaccreted discount. Where borrowings&#13;
are part of a designated hedging relationship employing derivative instruments, the carrying amount is adjusted for changes in fair value&#13;
attributable to the risk being hedged. Adjustments for changes in fair value attributable to hedged risks are reported in other unrealized gains&#13;
and losses on financial instruments in the income statement. Interest on borrowings and amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts&#13;
are reported in charges on borrowings.&#13;
&#13;
Risk management, derivative instruments and hedge accounting -                     The Corporation enters into transactions in various derivative&#13;
instruments for financial risk management purposes in connection with its principal business activities, including lending, client risk management,&#13;
borrowing, liquid asset portfolio management and asset and liability management. The Corporation does not use derivatives for speculative,&#13;
marketing or merchandising purposes.&#13;
&#13;
All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Where they are not clearly&#13;
and closely related to the host contract, certain derivative instruments embedded in loans, equity investments and market borrowing&#13;
transactions entered into on or after January 1, 1999 are bifurcated from the host contract and recorded at fair value as derivative assets and&#13;
liabilities. The value at inception of such embedded derivatives is excluded from the carrying value of the host contracts on the balance sheet.&#13;
 Changes in fair values of derivative instruments used in liquid asset portfolio management activities are recorded in net gains and losses on&#13;
trading activities. Changes in fair values of derivative instruments other than those used in liquid asset portfolio management activities are&#13;
recorded in other unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments.&#13;
&#13;
Subject to certain specific qualifying conditions in SFAS No. 133, a derivative instrument may be designated either as a hedge of the fair value&#13;
of an asset or liability (fair value hedge), or as a hedge of the variability of cash flows of an asset or liability or forecasted transaction (cash flow&#13;
hedge). For a derivative instrument qualifying as a fair value hedge, fair value gains or losses on the derivative instrument are reported in net&#13;
income, together with offsetting fair value gains or losses on the hedged item that are attributable to the risk being hedged. For a derivative&#13;
instrument qualifying as a cash flow hedge, fair value gains or losses associated with the risk being hedged are reported in other comprehensive&#13;
income and released to net income in the period(s) in which the effect on net income of the hedged item is recorded. Fair value gains and&#13;
losses on a derivative instrument not qualifying as a hedge are reported in net income.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation has designated certain hedging relationships in its borrowing and lending activities as fair value hedges. The Corporation&#13;
generally matches the terms of its derivatives with the terms of the specific underlying financial instruments hedged, in terms of currencies,&#13;
maturity dates, reset dates, interest rates and other features. However, the valuation methodologies applied to the derivative and the hedged&#13;
financial instrument, as prescribed by SFAS No. 133, may differ. The resulting ineffectiveness calculated for such relationships is recorded in&#13;
other unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments in the income statement.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation has not designated any hedging relationships as cash flow hedges.&#13;
&#13;
The risk management policy for each of the Corporation's principal business activities and the accounting policies particular to them are&#13;
described below.&#13;
&#13;
Lending activities The Corporation's policy is to closely match the currency, rate basis and maturity of its loans and borrowings. Derivative&#13;
instruments are used to convert the cash flows from fixed rate US dollar or non-US dollar loans into variable rate US dollars. The impact on net&#13;
income of changes in fair value of interest rate swaps qualifying for the shortcut method under SFAS No. 133 is exactly offset by a&#13;
corresponding adjustment to the fair value of the related loans. The Corporation has elected not to designate hedging relationships for all other&#13;
lending-related derivatives that do not qualify for the shortcut method.&#13;
&#13;
Client risk management activities The Corporation enters into derivatives transactions with its clients to help them hedge their own currency,&#13;
interest rate or commodity risk, which, in turn, improves the overall quality of the Corporation's loan portfolio. To hedge the market risks that&#13;
arise from these transactions with clients, the Corporation enters into offsetting derivative transactions with matching terms with authorized&#13;
market counterparties. Changes in fair value of all derivatives associated with these activities are reflected currently in net income. Though&#13;
hedge accounting is not applicable to these activities, the matching of terms between the offsetting transactions minimizes the impact on net&#13;
income. Fees and spreads charged on these transactions are recorded as income on an accrual basis.&#13;
&#13;
Borrowing activities The Corporation issues debt securities in various capital markets with the objectives of minimizing its borrowing costs,&#13;
diversifying funding sources, and developing member countries' capital markets, sometimes using complex structures. These structures include&#13;
borrowings payable in multiple currencies, or borrowings with principal and/or interest determined by reference to a specified index such as a&#13;
stock market index, a reference interest rate, a commodity index, or one or more foreign exchange rates. The Corporation uses derivative&#13;
instruments with matching terms, primarily currency and interest rate swaps, to convert such borrowings into variable rate US dollar obligations,&#13;
consistent with the Corporation's matched funding policy. The Corporation has designated the majority of derivatives associated with borrowing&#13;
activities as fair value hedges of the underlying borrowings. There are a small number of cash flow-like hedging transactions for which no hedge&#13;
relationship has been designated.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
      Liquid asset portfolio management activities The Corporation manages the interest rate, currency and other market risks associated with certain&#13;
      of the time deposits and securities in its liquid asset portfolio by entering into derivative transactions to convert the cash flows from those&#13;
      instruments into variable rate US dollars, consistent with the Corporation's matched funding policy. The derivative instruments used include&#13;
      short-term, over-the-counter foreign exchange forwards (covered forwards), interest rate and currency swaps, and exchange-traded interest rate&#13;
      futures and options. As the entire liquid asset portfolio is classified as a trading portfolio, all securities (including derivatives) are carried at fair&#13;
      value, and no hedging relationships have been designated.&#13;
&#13;
      Asset and liability management In addition to the risk managed in the context of its business activities detailed above, the Corporation faces&#13;
      residual market risk in its overall asset and liability management. Residual currency risk is managed by monitoring the aggregate position in&#13;
      each lending currency and eliminating the net excess asset or liability position through spot sales or purchases. Interest rate risk due to reset&#13;
      date mismatches is reduced by synchronizing the reset dates on assets and liabilities and managing overall interest rate risk on an aggregate&#13;
      basis. Interest rate risk arising from mismatches due to writedowns, prepayments and reschedulings, and residual reset date mismatches, is&#13;
      monitored by measuring the sensitivity of the present value of assets and liabilities in each currency to each basis point change in interest rates.&#13;
&#13;
      The Corporation monitors the credit risk associated with these activities by careful assessment and monitoring of prospective and actual clients&#13;
      and counterparties. In respect of liquid assets and derivatives transactions, credit risk is managed by establishing exposure limits based on the&#13;
      credit rating and size of the individual counterparty. In addition, the Corporation has entered into master agreements governing derivative&#13;
      transactions that contain close-out and netting provisions and collateral arrangements. Under these agreements, if the Corporation's credit&#13;
      exposure to a counterparty, on a mark-to-market basis, exceeds a specified level, the counterparty must post collateral to cover the excess,&#13;
      generally in the form of liquid government securities.&#13;
&#13;
      Resource mobilization - The Corporation mobilizes funds from commercial banks and other financial institutions (Participants) by facilitating&#13;
      loan participations, without recourse. These loan participations are administered and serviced by the Corporation on behalf of the Participants.&#13;
      The disbursed and outstanding balances of the loan participations are not included in the Corporation's balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
      Pension and other postretirement benefits - IBRD has a defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP)&#13;
      and a Post-Employment Benefits Plan (PEBP) that cover substantially all of its staff members as well as the staff of the Corporation and of&#13;
      MIGA.&#13;
&#13;
      The SRP provides regular pension benefits and includes a cash balance plan. The RSBP provides certain health and life insurance benefits to&#13;
      eligible retirees. The PEBP provides pension benefits administered outside the SRP. All costs associated with these plans are allocated&#13;
      between IBRD, the Corporation, and MIGA based upon their employees' respective participation in the plans. In addition, the Corporation and&#13;
      MIGA reimburse IBRD for their share of any contributions made to these plans by IBRD.&#13;
&#13;
      The net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense allocated to the Corporation is included in income from&#13;
      (contributions to) Staff Retirement Plan and cost of (income from) other postretirement benefits, respectively, in the income statement. The&#13;
      Corporation includes a receivable from IBRD in receivables and other assets, representing prepaid pension and other postretirement benefit&#13;
      costs.&#13;
&#13;
      Accounting and financial reporting developments - During the year ended June 30, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board&#13;
      (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees&#13;
      of Indebtedness of Others ­ an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34 (FIN45). The&#13;
      initial recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45 were effective for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Accounting&#13;
      for guarantees issued prior to this date is unaffected by FIN 45. The Corporation issued a small number of guarantees during the period&#13;
      January 1, 2003 through June 30, 2003, and the adoption of FIN 45 has had no material impact on the results of operations, statement of&#13;
      financial position or cash flows of the Corporation. Disclosures concerning guarantees, including those required by FIN 45 as of June 30, 2003,&#13;
      have been made in Note C.&#13;
&#13;
      On January 17, 2003, FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ­ an interpretation of ARB No. 51&#13;
      (FIN 46). FIN 46 is applicable to all entities with variable interests in variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 immediately, and,&#13;
      for the Corporation, FIN 46 is applicable to any variable interests in a variable interest entity created before February 1, 2003, beginning July 1,&#13;
      2003. The Corporation is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of FIN 46.&#13;
&#13;
      During the year ended June 30, 2003, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on&#13;
      Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 149 codifies certain implementation decisions previously issued by the Derivatives&#13;
      Implementation Group and addresses additional implementation issues relating to the definition of a derivative. The Standard also clarifies the&#13;
      definition of a financial guarantee to conform with FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for&#13;
      Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. SFAS No. 149 is effective for the Corporation on July 1, 2003 (FY04), and&#13;
      is not expected to have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations for the Corporation.&#13;
&#13;
      During the year ended June 30, 2003, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial&#13;
      Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150 clarifies how the issuer classifies and measures certain financial&#13;
      instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equities and is expected to lead to an increase in the number of quasi-debt/quasi-equity&#13;
      instruments issued being classified as liabilities on the issuer's balance sheet. SFAS No. 150 is effective for the Corporation on July 1, 2003&#13;
      (FY04), and is not expected to have a material impact on either the financial position or the results of operations of the Corporation.&#13;

      NOTE I ­ CAPITAL STOCK&#13;
&#13;
      The Corporation's authorized share capital was increased to $2,450 million through two capital increases in 1992. The subscription and&#13;
      payment period for shares then allocated ended on August 1, 1999, but the Corporation has agreed to defer the payment date for certain&#13;
      member countries beyond this date. Pursuant to these arrangements, $2 million of subscribed shares remained unpaid at June 30, 2003&#13;
      ($2 million - June 30, 2002).&#13;
&#13;
      During the year ended June 30, 2003, no shares were subscribed by member countries (92 shares at a par value of $1,000 each - year ended&#13;
      June 30, 2002). No monies were paid in on account of subscriptions in the year ended June 30, 2003 (less than $1 million - year ended June&#13;

2002; gains $22 million ­ year ended June 30, 2001) are attributable to borrowings and related derivatives transactions, unrealized losses of $40&#13;
million (losses $19 million - year ended 30 June, 2002; losses $7 million ­ year ended June 30, 2001) are attributable to loans and related&#13;
derivatives transactions and unrealized losses of $1 million (gains $1 million - year ended 30 June, 2002; losses $4 million ­ year ended June&#13;
30, 2001) are attributable to client risk management activities.&#13;
&#13;
At the date of initial application of SFAS No. 133 on July 1, 2000, certain items were recorded as a transition adjustment, denoted as the&#13;
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the income statement. The transition adjustment included, first, the difference between&#13;
the previous carrying value and the fair value of all freestanding derivative instruments. Secondly, it included the offsetting gains and losses on&#13;
assets and liabilities held under fair value-like hedging relationships in existence prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 133 that are also recognized&#13;
by adjusting their carrying value to fair value. Finally, the adjustment included the fair value of derivatives embedded in hybrid financial&#13;
instruments entered into on or after January 1, 1999, where they are required to be separated from their respective host contracts, and also&#13;
recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The total amount of the transition adjustment, recorded on July 1, 2000, was $93 million.&#13;
&#13;
Also upon adoption of SFAS No. 133, the Corporation recorded a gain of $14 million to accumulated other comprehensive income to adjust the&#13;
book value to fair value of cross-currency interest rate swaps in cash flow-like hedges. The Corporation elected not to seek hedge accounting&#13;
for these transactions under SFAS No.133 and, accordingly, records the cross-currency interest rate swaps at fair value, with the change in fair&#13;
value included in earnings. The gain recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income upon adoption of SFAS No.133 is released into&#13;
earnings over the remaining original hedge term. The amounts released for the years ended June 30, 2003 and June 30, 2002 are shown&#13;
above; the expected release for the year ending June 30, 2004 is $2 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE M ­ DERIVATIVE AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS&#13;
&#13;
Many of the Corporation's financial instruments are not actively traded in any market. Accordingly, estimates and present value calculations of&#13;
future cash flows are used to estimate the fair values. Determining future cash flows for fair value estimation is subjective and imprecise, and&#13;
minor changes in assumptions or methodologies may materially affect the estimated values. The excess or deficit resulting from the difference&#13;
between the carrying amounts and the fair values presented does not necessarily reflect the realizable values, since the Corporation generally&#13;
holds loans, borrowings and other financial instruments to maturity with the aim of realizing their recorded values.&#13;
&#13;
The estimated fair values reflect the interest rate environments as of June 30, 2003 and June 30, 2002. In different interest rate environments,&#13;
the fair value of the Corporation's financial assets and liabilities could differ significantly, especially the fair value of certain fixed rate financial&#13;
instruments. Reasonable comparability of fair values among financial institutions is not likely, because of the wide range of permitted valuation&#13;
techniques and numerous estimates that must be made in the absence of secondary market prices. This lack of objective pricing standards&#13;
introduces a greater degree of subjectivity and volatility to these derived or estimated fair values. Therefore, while disclosure of estimated fair&#13;
values of financial instruments is required, readers are cautioned in using these data for purposes of evaluating the financial condition of the&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
      Corporation. The fair values of the individual financial instruments do not represent the fair value of the Corporation taken as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
      The methodologies used and key assumptions made to estimate fair values as of June 30, 2003 and June 30, 2002 are summarized below.&#13;
&#13;
      Liquid assets - The estimated fair value of time deposits and the trading securities portfolio are based on quoted market prices and the present&#13;
      value of estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.&#13;
&#13;
      Derivative instruments - Fair values for covered forwards were derived by using quoted market forward exchange rates. Fair values for other&#13;
      derivative instruments were derived by determining the present value of estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.&#13;
&#13;
      Loans and loan commitments - The Corporation generally has not sold its loans from the portfolio, and there is no comparable secondary&#13;
      market. Fair values for fixed rate loans and loan commitments were determined using a discounted cash flow model based on a discount rate&#13;
      comprising the fixed rate loan spread plus the year-end estimated cost of funds. Since rates on variable rate loans and loan commitments are&#13;
      generally reset on a quarterly or semiannual basis, the carrying value adjusted for credit risk was determined to be the best estimate of fair&#13;
      value. The Corporation also holds options to convert loans into equity of certain of its investee companies. Fair values of these conversion&#13;
      options are based on quoted market prices or other calculated values of the underlying equity investment.&#13;
&#13;
      Equity investments - Fair values were determined using market prices where available, put option prices, book values or cost, certain of which&#13;
      were discounted based upon management's estimate of net realizable value. Where market prices were not available or alternate valuation&#13;
      techniques were not practical, cost was determined to be the best estimate of fair value. Prior to the year ended June 30, 2003, management's&#13;
      estimate of fair value considered the relative illiquidity and volatility, as well as the overall business constraints, in the emerging markets in which&#13;
      the Corporation invests. Pursuant to a review of equity valuation methodologies undertaken in the year ended June 30, 2003, the Corporation no&#13;
      longer considers such factors in estimating the fair value of equity investments. Prior year numbers have been restated for comparability&#13;
      purposes.&#13;
&#13;
      Borrowings - Fair values were derived by determining the present value of estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.&#13;
&#13;
      Estimated fair values of the Corporation's financial assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are summarized below&#13;
      (US$ millions). The Corporation's credit exposure is represented by the estimated fair values of its financial assets.&#13;

NOTE N ­ CURRENCY POSITION&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation conducts its operations for its loans, time deposits and securities and borrowings in multiple currencies. The Corporation's&#13;
policy is to minimize the level of currency risk by closely matching the currency of its assets (other than equity investments and quasi-equity&#13;
investments) and liabilities by using hedging instruments. The Corporation's equity investments in enterprises located in its developing member&#13;
countries are typically made in the local currency of the country. As a matter of policy, the Corporation carries the currency risk of equity&#13;
investments and quasi-equity investments and funds these investments from its capital and retained earnings.&#13;

      NOTE O ­ SEGMENT REPORTING&#13;
&#13;
      For management purposes, the Corporation's business comprises two segments: client services and treasury services. The client services&#13;
      segment consists primarily of lending and equity investment activities. The treasury services segment consists of the borrowing, liquid asset&#13;
      management, asset and liability management and client risk management activities.&#13;
&#13;
      The assessment of segment performance by senior management includes net income for each segment, return on assets, and return on capital&#13;
      employed. The Corporation's management reporting system and policies are used to determine revenues and expenses attributable to each&#13;
      segment. Consistent with internal reporting, administrative expenses are allocated to each segment based largely upon personnel costs and&#13;
      segment head counts. Transactions between segments are immaterial and, thus, are not a factor in reconciling to the consolidated data.&#13;
&#13;
      The accounting policies of the Corporation's segments are, in all material respects, consistent with those described in note A, "Summary of&#13;
      Significant Accounting and Related Policies."&#13;
&#13;
      An analysis of the Corporation's major components of income and expense by business segment for the years ended June 30, 2003, 2002 and&#13;
      2001 is given below (US$ millions):&#13;

                                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE P ­ PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS&#13;
&#13;
IBRD has a defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP) and a Post-Employment Benefits Plan (PEBP)&#13;
that cover substantially all of its staff members as well as the staff of the Corporation and of MIGA.&#13;
&#13;
The SRP provides regular pension benefits and includes a cash balance plan. The RSBP provides certain health and life insurance benefits to&#13;
eligible retirees. The PEBP provides pension benefits administered outside the SRP. All costs associated with these plans are allocated&#13;
between IBRD, the Corporation, and MIGA based upon their employees' respective participation in the plans. In addition, the Corporation and&#13;
MIGA reimburse IBRD for their share of any contributions made to these plans by IBRD.&#13;
&#13;
Net cost from the SRP allocated to the Corporation for the year ended June 30, 2003 was $15 million ($36 million - year ended June 30, 2002;&#13;
$50 million - year ended June 30, 2001). The portion of the cost for the RSBP and the PEBP attributable to the Corporation for the fiscal year&#13;
ended June 30, 2003 was $9 million ($5 million - year ended June 30, 2002; $3 million - year ended June 30, 2001).&#13;
&#13;
In addition, at June 30, 2003 $277 million was receivable by the Corporation from IBRD ($286 million - June 30, 2002), representing the&#13;
accumulated excess of its contributions to pension and other postretirement benefit assets over its allocated net periodic pension and other&#13;
postretirement benefit cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE Q ­ SERVICE AND SUPPORT PAYMENTS&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation obtains certain administrative and overhead services from IBRD in those areas where common services can be efficiently&#13;
provided by IBRD. This includes shared costs of the Boards of Governors and Directors, and other services such as communications, internal&#13;
auditing, administrative support, supplies and insurance. Payments for these services are made by the Corporation to IBRD based on&#13;
negotiated fees, chargebacks and allocated charges, where chargeback is not feasible. Expenses allocated to the Corporation for the year&#13;
ended June 30, 2003, were $19 million, unchanged from years ended June 30, 2002 and June 30, 2001.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE R ­ REORGANIZATION COSTS&#13;
&#13;
On March 8, 2002 the Corporation adopted a Strategic Directions Paper articulating its strategic priorities, being: frontier markets; high impact&#13;
sectors; and support for small to medium sized enterprises. To achieve these strategic priorities, in late March, the Corporation began a major&#13;
internal reorganization planning exercise designed to sharpen the focus on the needs of the Corporation's clients, strengthen developmental&#13;
impact, increase the volume of high quality assets, and provide counter-cyclical support in countries affected by volatility in capital flows. Details&#13;
and particulars of the reorganization plan were finalized and announced during the quarter ended June 30, 2002. The plan involved staff&#13;
reductions, field office closings and reorganizations, and a headquarters reorganization which was substantially concluded during the year&#13;
ending June 30, 2003.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation charged $13 million associated with the reorganization, included in administrative expenses in the income statement for the&#13;
year ended June 30, 2002. The charge primarily represented costs associated with termination benefits (including outplacement consulting, job&#13;
search assistance, training, medical insurance plan contributions, severance payments and related tax allowances) for 115 staff identified for&#13;
separation as of June 30, 2002 and an additional amount, less than $1 million, associated with various field office closures and reorganizations.&#13;
Actual expenses paid during the year ended June 30, 2003 and June 30, 2002 totaled $11 million. $1 million of the original accrual is expected&#13;
to be paid in the year ending June 30, 2004. As a result, the original accrual has been revised downwards by $1 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE S ­ TRUST FUNDS&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation uses the services of IBRD to administer funds on behalf of donors which are restricted for specific uses, including technical&#13;
assistance, feasibility studies and project preparation, global and regional programs and research and training programs. These funds are&#13;
placed in trust and are not included in the Corporation's assets. The responsibilities of the Corporation are to arrange for services generally not&#13;
otherwise provided by it including full project implementation and procurement of goods and services. The distribution of Trust Fund assets by&#13;
executing agent is as follows (US$ millions):&#13;

financial institutions in emerging markets and as we help build business&#13;
skills.We consider positive development impact an integral part of good&#13;
business, and we focus much of our effort on the countries with the&#13;

            International Finance Corporation (IFC)
            annual report 2003 : innovation, impact, sustainability -
            IFC's commitment
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This annual report reviews the oerations
            of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) during fiscal
            year 2003. IFC's operating income for FY03 grew to $528
            million, more than triple the figure for FY02 and one of the
            highest on record. Its committed portfolio grew by 11.5
            percent to $16.8 billion. It was a year that emphasized
            coordination, and mutually reinforcing efforts among World
            Bank Group units, particularly in pursuing private sector
            development in client countries. The report stresses the
            need for support of IFC's priorities, including
            emerging, and frontier markets, technical assistance, and
            advisory services to help improve investment climates, and
            small and medium enterprises. Also underscored, is the
            significance of IFC's presence in difficult, country
            environments as a central component of its development
            mandate, while IFC's counter-cyclical role in the face
            of heightened investor uncertainty, and volatility of
            capital flows to developing countries, is recognized, as is
            the performance within the annual portfolio performance
            review, despite continued difficulty in the global economic
            environment. IFC's financial management is reviewed,
            and its leadership for protecting the Corporation's
            financial integrity, without compromising its development
            mandate, was commendable, though the need to maintain
            profitability, while increasing development impacts, is
            stressed. The report presents financial highlights,
            particularly outlining IFC's commitment to innovation,
            impact, and sustainability, and further identifies the
            period's operational, and regional outlook. The report
            also summarizes the financial and portfolio reviews, as well
            as technical assistance and advisory services during FY03.
