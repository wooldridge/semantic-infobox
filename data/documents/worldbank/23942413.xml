                          THE WORLD BANK&#13;
                           May 24, 1995&#13;
&#13;
     Q:      You hadn't been away from your African activities&#13;
&#13;
very much, but you did take a break due to the reorga-&#13;
&#13;
nization. When you returned, if you could give us an idea of&#13;
&#13;
what you found.    You do have something of a mandate from the&#13;
&#13;
reorganization.    There were objectives and you must have had&#13;
&#13;
those in your mind.    So if you could tell us what things&#13;
&#13;
looked like and what you saw as the problems.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, I was named Vice President, Africa Region.       I was&#13;
&#13;
in charge of a combined Western and Eastern-Southern Africa.&#13;
&#13;
 Eastern-Southern had been the name of the region I was Vice&#13;
&#13;
President of before the reorganization. Wilfried Thalwitz had&#13;
&#13;
been in charge of the Western Africa Region, and went from&#13;
&#13;
there to EMENA.     It was only four months really between the&#13;
&#13;
start of the reorganization business and nominally I had been&#13;
&#13;
Vice President of the Eastern-Southern Africa Region even&#13;
&#13;
while I was in charge of the reorganization.       Nobody took my&#13;
&#13;
place.    Somebody must have been Acting.   I can't remember how&#13;
&#13;
we did it.    But when I came back it was an entirely different&#13;
&#13;
thing.    We went through the business of "farmer takes a wife,&#13;
&amp;#12;                            WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95    Page 2&#13;
&#13;
wife takes a child" process in the staffing of the new&#13;
&#13;
organization. So in the summer of 1987 we were busy making&#13;
&#13;
all of these personnel choices and putting the thing back&#13;
&#13;
together.     The new region combined the two previous ones.     It&#13;
&#13;
also brought into it a little unit that had been in the&#13;
&#13;
President's office or Senior Vice President of Operations'&#13;
&#13;
office.     This was the Africa unit.   I can't remember what its&#13;
&#13;
name was.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   That was part of the decentralization?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.     That had been a sort of a cockamamie arrangement,&#13;
&#13;
because Sub-Saharan Africa was split into two.     There was no&#13;
&#13;
locus for common issues, such as raising resources for&#13;
&#13;
Africa. I think that this office had been established because&#13;
&#13;
of a special program or joint financing program.     The&#13;
&#13;
previous IDA replenishment was not a fulsome replenishment&#13;
&#13;
and the Europeans made up the difference between what their&#13;
&#13;
burden sharing would require them to contribute, and what&#13;
&#13;
they wanted to make sure Africa had by inventing this special&#13;
&#13;
joint financing facility. This unit was in Ernie's office, to&#13;
&amp;#12;                          WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95     Page 3&#13;
&#13;
allocate and administer these funds. That unit evolved to the&#13;
&#13;
Africa Region.&#13;
&#13;
     We also had a technical department and in my opinion at&#13;
&#13;
least we had a very important backlog of unaddressed policy&#13;
&#13;
issues in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Could you go through a few of those?&#13;
&#13;
A:   The way I saw it, most of the Bank's policies were never&#13;
&#13;
refined consistently for application in Africa. Yet the&#13;
&#13;
underlying institutional weaknesses, the lack of consensus&#13;
&#13;
within Africa, was such that we were having a troublesome&#13;
&#13;
time applying what looked like perfectly sane Bankwide&#13;
&#13;
policies.   But because of the classification of the region&#13;
&#13;
there was never one person in charge to focus on this issue.&#13;
&#13;
That was one of the reasons, in fact, why the reorganization&#13;
&#13;
recommended the merger of the two Africas. No matter what the&#13;
&#13;
quality of the individuals in charge of separate Africa&#13;
&#13;
regions, the fact is that you end up with the lowest common&#13;
&#13;
denominator when you solve common issues. The two sides&#13;
&#13;
either agreed or they had to go to the Senior Vice President&#13;
&amp;#12;                          WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95      Page 4&#13;
&#13;
for Operations, who had rather limited time to address&#13;
&#13;
African issues.&#13;
&#13;
     So one of the hallmarks of the reorganization in 1987,&#13;
&#13;
was the creation of a region that had room for valid&#13;
&#13;
generalizations, where you could have valid policies with&#13;
&#13;
some refinement. So we set about defining our approach in&#13;
&#13;
education and health, family planning, most of the main areas&#13;
&#13;
that we needed to address in Africa, basically adapting&#13;
&#13;
Bankwide issues.   Sometimes we kept looking at special&#13;
&#13;
problems. For instance, I remember we took on AIDS and some&#13;
&#13;
of these other issues long before the Bank as a whole did. We&#13;
&#13;
built a capacity to deal with that issue very early on, we&#13;
&#13;
sort of invented that.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Could you fill that out with a little detail?&#13;
&#13;
A:   First of all, we had a very gung-ho management team,&#13;
&#13;
because of the way the selection had taken place. It was a&#13;
&#13;
magic moment, everybody had chosen to be here or was chosen&#13;
&#13;
to be here.   It was a neutral decision to be here.     Nobody&#13;
&#13;
inherited somebody else's crew and had to live with it.&#13;
&#13;
Although the team started changing almost immediately, it was&#13;
&amp;#12;                             WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95     Page 5&#13;
&#13;
wonderful the way we got off, because this time was so&#13;
&#13;
stressful that we spent the whole summer and nobody took one&#13;
&#13;
day of leave.     There was a kind of lifeboat mentality and the&#13;
&#13;
Bank was an exciting place for several months, and years&#13;
&#13;
maybe.    There was so much to do.&#13;
&#13;
     We had     brought into Africa a number of young managers.&#13;
&#13;
Sven Sandstrom was a director, Calisto Madavo was a director,&#13;
&#13;
and Caio Koch-Weser was a director.      These guys had been&#13;
&#13;
involved in the reorganization task forces.      So a number of&#13;
&#13;
the Africa managers were fully committed to the reorga-&#13;
&#13;
nization and the way it was supposed to operate at the&#13;
&#13;
regional level.     So this region really did take advantage of&#13;
&#13;
all that.     I didn't have to spend a lot of time convincing&#13;
&#13;
people.     It just moved.   And I think we made, in a couple of&#13;
&#13;
years, really quite outstanding progress on a lot of fronts&#13;
&#13;
for Africa.&#13;
&#13;
     We also launched during this period, a major thing&#13;
&#13;
called the "Long-term Perspective Study" on Africa.        We in&#13;
&#13;
the region were worried that the IMF programs were&#13;
&#13;
concentrating on short-term balances, getting those balances&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95      Page 6&#13;
&#13;
at the expense of the long-term development objectives, and&#13;
&#13;
we needed to lift our eyes off the crisis and put things into&#13;
&#13;
 perspective.&#13;
&#13;
     We also invented the SPA during 1987.     We had our first&#13;
&#13;
meeting at the end of 1987.    This was handled by the group&#13;
&#13;
that came from Ernie's shop, Xavier de la Renaudiere and&#13;
&#13;
others.    Although Xavier retired in the context of the&#13;
&#13;
reorganization, he did stick around and Phil Birnbaum, who&#13;
&#13;
was in that group at the center, came over and we launched&#13;
&#13;
the SPA.   Moeen Qureshi providing some leadership, I had to&#13;
&#13;
carry the ball and make something out of this.&#13;
&#13;
     The SPA is a very important achievement, in the history&#13;
&#13;
of the Bank, as a matter of fact.     The ideas were just&#13;
&#13;
dawning at the time of the reorganization.     There were a&#13;
&#13;
number of people who could legitimately claim paternity for&#13;
&#13;
these ideas, including Ernie and Xavier.     The idea was to&#13;
&#13;
bring all the donors together in support of structural&#13;
&#13;
adjustment in Africa. Something that the other donors were&#13;
&#13;
not willing to support.    They were not willing to provide&#13;
&#13;
balance of payment type of support.    All of the professionals&#13;
&amp;#12;                            WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95      Page 7&#13;
&#13;
from the aid agencies were against that and we didn't have&#13;
&#13;
enough money to support these programs.     The real reason to&#13;
&#13;
turn everybody around was this long-term perspective study.&#13;
&#13;
It underlined that instead of just getting the balances right&#13;
&#13;
we were interested in getting growth and some forward&#13;
&#13;
movement.     The basic problem was that you can't steer a&#13;
&#13;
parked car.     You've got to be moving before you can get any&#13;
&#13;
real adjustment.    And, I mean moving forward, for they really&#13;
&#13;
were moving in a negative sense.     In fact, Africa was going&#13;
&#13;
down the hill, so to speak.     That was happening because in&#13;
&#13;
getting the balances in the short run we were constantly&#13;
&#13;
cutting expenditure. There was not enough time to develop the&#13;
&#13;
capacity to raise taxes and start domestic resource&#13;
&#13;
mobilization.    Government had lost its authority in most of&#13;
&#13;
these countries anyway, so the only thing to do was cut&#13;
&#13;
expenditures, cutting costs, and of course that was basically&#13;
&#13;
leading us to a balanced budget of zero. We were going to&#13;
&#13;
have no government, no schools, no roads, no nothing, and&#13;
&#13;
this was the way we were headed and rather rapidly.       So we&#13;
&#13;
had to turn that around.&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95     Page 8&#13;
&#13;
     We had to identify the gaps in these countries in the&#13;
&#13;
context of some growth, per capita income growth.    And we did&#13;
&#13;
not see that we could continue to compress consumption or&#13;
&#13;
continue to make indiscriminate cuts in expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Sometimes there is tension between per capita growth and&#13;
&#13;
poverty alleviation.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Oh, yeah.   But you need both.   You are not going to get&#13;
&#13;
any poverty alleviation without per capita growth. That is a&#13;
&#13;
definition of policy, because on average these countries are&#13;
&#13;
at or below the poverty line, the average income is below the&#13;
&#13;
poverty line.    So this is not a sophisticated concept,&#13;
&#13;
without getting into purchasing power parities and all that.&#13;
&#13;
But the margin is so minor that it's not worth talking about.&#13;
&#13;
 It would be much easier to get growth than it would be to&#13;
&#13;
reallocate this paltry pie.    People would kill each other&#13;
&#13;
over their crops already. In the circumstances, it would be&#13;
&#13;
much easier to get growth.    This was staring us in the face.&#13;
&#13;
These countries had a lot of potential, but the IMF programs&#13;
&#13;
that we were dealing with were going in the wrong direction.&#13;
&#13;
 It was not the Italian model where you change your exchange&#13;
&amp;#12;                          WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95      Page 9&#13;
&#13;
rate and thousands of people go into leather goods or&#13;
&#13;
something, and then the balances are corrected and everybody&#13;
&#13;
is back to their old standard of living.     This is not what&#13;
&#13;
happens in Africa.   We don't have the infrastructure.    We&#13;
&#13;
don't have the human resource development.      We don't have the&#13;
&#13;
management capacity to make those things happen.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Were you dealing directly with the IMF on this?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes. And this was a confrontation. But we finally got&#13;
&#13;
them on board when they realized that if you took these long-&#13;
&#13;
term projections this becomes obvious. Shortly thereafter we&#13;
&#13;
had to invent the PFP.   That was invented for Africa because&#13;
&#13;
they were done only in the context of IDA countries. Africa&#13;
&#13;
is where the action is for IDA. So once we had these programs&#13;
&#13;
working, we could see the trend turn around. We never saw&#13;
&#13;
before that the per capita growth would turn around because&#13;
&#13;
with the lower levels of expenditure, we were cutting right&#13;
&#13;
into the bone and muscle of these economies.&#13;
&#13;
     So we invented this SPA, and this was a very creative&#13;
&#13;
thing.   It recognized that we needed growth.    It recognized&#13;
&#13;
that the gap had to be defined, it had to be filled, not in a&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95      Page 10&#13;
&#13;
balancing but in a satisfactory scenario. That was the&#13;
&#13;
starting point and it meant a bigger gap because it had to&#13;
&#13;
have enough juice in the overall scenario for growth to take&#13;
&#13;
place, per capita income growth, which meant that growth had&#13;
&#13;
to be higher than the population growth rate by at least one&#13;
&#13;
percent.     That was our objective.   Minimal objective.   And we&#13;
&#13;
guaranteed to any country that was in bona fides adjustment&#13;
&#13;
that they would get the funding that was needed theoretically&#13;
&#13;
to achieve that.&#13;
&#13;
       Now we are in our third replenishment of this SPA. It&#13;
&#13;
has done just that guaranteed the needed transfer of&#13;
&#13;
resources.     Every gap has been filled.    There have been some&#13;
&#13;
slips, and some untoward events on occasion, but by and large&#13;
&#13;
it has     worked. The reason it succeeded was that the&#13;
&#13;
bilaterals were allowed to remain bilaterals.      They didn't&#13;
&#13;
have to turn their money over to IDA.       They made their loans&#13;
&#13;
directly to these countries.     They got credit for what they&#13;
&#13;
did.     They got to pick the countries they favored, and not&#13;
&#13;
had to contribute to some general pool. The World Bank, or&#13;
&#13;
IDA rather, acted like an underwriter.      We were ready to move&#13;
&amp;#12;                        WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95      Page 11&#13;
&#13;
to the unpopular countries provided they were in bona fides&#13;
&#13;
adjustment, and let the other donors carry their favorites,&#13;
&#13;
where we would reduce our participation in order that there&#13;
&#13;
was enough money to make this guarantee work for all the&#13;
&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
     We had up to about 30 countries in this program, and we&#13;
&#13;
still have 28.   They are moving, sometimes very slowly, but&#13;
&#13;
they are moving. For those 28 countries, the freefall that&#13;
&#13;
Africa was in in 1987, has been reversed. Most of them have&#13;
&#13;
growth rates over four percent.   This is despite the fact&#13;
&#13;
that during this period of time, I'm talking about the five-&#13;
&#13;
year period from '87 to '93. We had the worst economic&#13;
&#13;
recession since the Thirties. The most prolonged at any rate,&#13;
&#13;
where Africa was coming from a totally disconnected situation&#13;
&#13;
with the world economy, to some measure of integration.      I&#13;
&#13;
think this has been a major success story in terms of&#13;
&#13;
partnership, in terms of mobilizing resources.&#13;
&#13;
     At the first meeting in '87, I remember, we got a $6.6&#13;
&#13;
billion pledge out of the donors at that meeting. About half&#13;
&#13;
of that could be considered new money in the sense that it&#13;
&amp;#12;                             WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95   Page 12&#13;
&#13;
would be disbursed so rapidly that it would amount to a&#13;
&#13;
doubling of their commitment to Africa. You can see it in the&#13;
&#13;
aid statistics, all of a sudden the amount of money flowing&#13;
&#13;
to Africa went way up.&#13;
&#13;
     A very comprehensive approach, too, in the sense that it&#13;
&#13;
took account of export proceeds, debt rescheduling, all the&#13;
&#13;
sources of finance that were available, and all the donors.&#13;
&#13;
And the donors got, in return for all of this, the collective&#13;
&#13;
security of the group supporting these highly risky,&#13;
&#13;
controversial reform programs with a lot of political&#13;
&#13;
overtones.   We did all the dirty work.      They got the credit&#13;
&#13;
for supporting things, after we had negotiated the deal.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did they know that before the deal?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Sure.   That was clearly stated that that was what we&#13;
&#13;
were offering.     That's one of the reasons they were able to&#13;
&#13;
participate. Part of the prejudice against this kind of&#13;
&#13;
policy-based lending was that the donors knew that one&#13;
&#13;
country cannot stick its nose so deeply into the affairs of&#13;
&#13;
another country, that only the Bank could probably get away&#13;
&#13;
with that.   The   u.s.   tried, and even they couldn't. Even with&#13;
&amp;#12;                         WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95     Page 13&#13;
&#13;
the smallest African country they just lost so much on the&#13;
&#13;
other side in terms of their other objectives, vis-a-vis each&#13;
&#13;
of these countries, political, business, trade, whatever,&#13;
&#13;
votes in the U.N. They lost so much when they became that&#13;
&#13;
intrusive that it wasn't worth the candle and the State&#13;
&#13;
Department did not support AID's involveme.nt.   They could&#13;
&#13;
have the rhetoric but they couldn't have the conditionality.&#13;
&#13;
 But we provided the conditionality which rounded things out,&#13;
&#13;
and everybody could go in there and say, "Oh, gee, the World&#13;
&#13;
Bank and the IMF have been really tough on you guys, but we&#13;
&#13;
are really proud of the fact that you are making this effort,&#13;
&#13;
and here's our support to make sure this is going to work."&#13;
&#13;
So this was a win-win situation. I don't know if we thought&#13;
&#13;
all this through, but it turned out to be brilliant in terms&#13;
&#13;
of its effects.   Now we cite it as the most successful aid&#13;
&#13;
coordination venture that the Bank's ever been involved in.&#13;
&#13;
     We were basically also trading for them information that&#13;
&#13;
they didn't otherwise get.   What they got was a biannual&#13;
&#13;
readout of the cash flow situation of 30 countries in Africa,&#13;
&#13;
including how the gap would be filled, or what remains&#13;
&amp;#12;                            WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95     Page 14&#13;
&#13;
unfilled, and a listing of all the other donors and what they&#13;
&#13;
are putting in.      So the British could look and see what the&#13;
&#13;
French were doing and the Americans were doing, and so forth,&#13;
&#13;
in each of these countries.      And because the money was not&#13;
&#13;
pooled in any way, and since they determined which countries&#13;
&#13;
to support, there was no talk about burden sharing of any&#13;
&#13;
kind.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      It was a self-generated approach.&#13;
&#13;
A:      Yeah.   Well, the whole thing was very congenial.   Nobody&#13;
&#13;
was expecting, like they do in IDA, that the United States&#13;
&#13;
would be as heavy on the ground as France and Britain in&#13;
&#13;
Africa, so there was no burden sharing concept to begin with.&#13;
&#13;
 Everybody wanted and nobody was worried about how soon it&#13;
&#13;
would be possible to bring the Japanese in. The second&#13;
&#13;
replenishment was $7.5 billion, and the third one was $7.8,&#13;
&#13;
so we've raised about $22 billion equivalent in the three&#13;
&#13;
replenishments.&#13;
&#13;
        So that's one of the major achievements, being able to&#13;
&#13;
talk about Africa.      I don't think that would have happened&#13;
&#13;
without the merged Africa region, because the amount of work&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95   Page 15&#13;
&#13;
required to generate that information and consistently hold&#13;
&#13;
control of the quality of that data just couldn't be done by&#13;
&#13;
two separate regions. I don't think you would have gotten the&#13;
&#13;
energy behind your program.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   But it also put you in a key position in terms of&#13;
&#13;
negotiating.     You could negotiate for that whole entity.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Right.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   And you were in a lot better negotiating position.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Oh, yeah.     If I were down the line in the organization&#13;
&#13;
that would not work. But if you take the guy who was going to&#13;
&#13;
operationalize the thing, put him also in the chair for&#13;
&#13;
raising the money, this really increases your credibility&#13;
&#13;
with these donors.     Some central Vice Presidency or other&#13;
&#13;
force would have to deal in abstractions and would not be as&#13;
&#13;
effective.     We were able to go to these people and say,&#13;
&#13;
"Okay.   This is the status in Burundi today."    "This is the&#13;
&#13;
status in Malawi today."     We would have meetings on each of&#13;
&#13;
these countries, each of these cash flows, the nuances of&#13;
&#13;
these countries, and we developed this information system&#13;
&#13;
which the donors needed.&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95    Page 16&#13;
&#13;
Q:     You are dealing donor to donor, you are dealing with one&#13;
&#13;
donor at a time, or are you dealing with them in groups?&#13;
&#13;
A:     All together--and one-on-one--in the sense that each one&#13;
&#13;
gets the entire picture.     Each one sees what everyone else is&#13;
&#13;
doing and what we are doing.      They are able to ask questions,&#13;
&#13;
they are able to say, "Why are you slowing down here?      Are we&#13;
&#13;
all together on this?"     The amount of communications between&#13;
&#13;
us and the donors was expanded just a thousand-fold.      Each of&#13;
&#13;
my directors has a responsibility to some donors, to know&#13;
&#13;
what their policies are, to be there when it's time to raise&#13;
&#13;
money, be there when it's time to answer questions, get to&#13;
&#13;
know the parliamentary committees that have got the money,&#13;
&#13;
make sure that they understand where we are coming from. So&#13;
&#13;
we have a big outreach program that keeps these guys on&#13;
&#13;
board. We meet every six months, once in Washington and once&#13;
&#13;
in Paris, and we've been doing that for nine years, since&#13;
&#13;
'87.    Eight and a half years.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Are you satisfied that you had more or less all the&#13;
&#13;
money that was needed?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Yeah.&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95      Page 17&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So at the end of the process you could say, money is not&#13;
&#13;
the problem now to get Africa back on course.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yeah.     Money is not the problem.     In fact, we are not&#13;
&#13;
able to use all the money we've got now.        That's partly&#13;
&#13;
because of the political transitions. The thing is so&#13;
&#13;
dependent upon African performance.        That's Number One.   You&#13;
&#13;
cannot get the money flowing unless reforms are taking place,&#13;
&#13;
so if there's a slowdown of reform there's a slowdown of&#13;
&#13;
money.   But as long as the reforms are moving at a fast pace,&#13;
&#13;
then we could run out of money.     This would be a fortunate&#13;
&#13;
day, in a sense.     This would be ideal.    This would mean that&#13;
&#13;
we got 30-odd countries in Africa going full bore for&#13;
&#13;
economic reform.    And they need a lot of money in order to&#13;
&#13;
make that happen.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Is your four percent figure the top or is four percent,&#13;
&#13;
the average?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, the average. The average growth rate of population&#13;
&#13;
in these countries is a little over three percent. So the&#13;
&#13;
target for reforming countries is minimally four something.&#13;
&#13;
Now, as a matter of fact, nobody is quite on target, so the&#13;
&amp;#12;                         WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95     Page 18&#13;
&#13;
average growth rate is substantially less.    But there are 21&#13;
&#13;
countries with positive per capita income growth over five&#13;
&#13;
years, and that's never happened since 1968 in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You do have a fair number of countries, though, that&#13;
&#13;
come in and drop off again?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yeah, this is always happening particularly now with the&#13;
&#13;
democratic transitions. We've gone from four countries with&#13;
&#13;
governments that are based on contested elections to 30 in&#13;
&#13;
the last four years.   If four years ago you had said that&#13;
&#13;
there were going to be 30 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
&#13;
where, you had oppositions in the parliaments and governments&#13;
&#13;
based on national elections which were contested by&#13;
&#13;
opposition parties, you would have been laughed at.    This was&#13;
&#13;
a big surprise.&#13;
&#13;
     That's a phenomenon that marks the end of the Cold War&#13;
&#13;
where basically every African government was dependent upon&#13;
&#13;
some outside power for its legitimacy domestically.    That&#13;
&#13;
meant that Mobutu could get away with bloody murder inside&#13;
&#13;
Zaire because he had a Big Brother outside.   He didn't have&#13;
&#13;
to worry about what his people thought.   Now, at the end of&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95   Page 19&#13;
&#13;
the Cold War, that game was finished. So each of these&#13;
&#13;
regimes has been destabilized and is looking for ways of&#13;
&#13;
legitimizing themselves domestically. Some of them tried to&#13;
&#13;
go to the ultimate dictatorship, but that has not worked and&#13;
&#13;
most of those countries are in civil war now.     The others&#13;
&#13;
have chosen the democratic option. Some of these are false,&#13;
&#13;
phony developments, but they are easy to spot.     And the&#13;
&#13;
others are legitimate but they are very fragile, and they are&#13;
&#13;
not necessarily performing very well.     So one of the problems&#13;
&#13;
now is that governments are not very capable of making&#13;
&#13;
decisions.     They are less capable than they were four years&#13;
&#13;
ago.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Democracy is sloppy.&#13;
&#13;
A:     Yes.   And there's a tremendous educational backlog,&#13;
&#13;
because nobody was brought along. In the reform process the&#13;
&#13;
economic side started before this political transition, and&#13;
&#13;
the opposition parties are all against economic reforms.&#13;
&#13;
Economic change is a very painful thing and if they were not&#13;
&#13;
included in the beginning, they naturally develop negative&#13;
&amp;#12;                         WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95        Page 20&#13;
&#13;
views against those changes.   So we are paying the price of&#13;
&#13;
that transition.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Do you get involved in this democratization process?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, we cannot get involved with the politics of this&#13;
&#13;
process. We do not use the word "democracy" very often.       We&#13;
&#13;
use the word "pluralism," though.     We break monopolies&#13;
&#13;
wherever we see them, and this has gone beyond economic&#13;
&#13;
monopolies, it's been applied to informational monopolies&#13;
&#13;
and, by extension it definitely involves political&#13;
&#13;
monopolies.   One way or another, these things are really one&#13;
&#13;
piece. The Bank tries to avoid the appearance of supporting&#13;
&#13;
the opposition per se but stimulating public debate, why we&#13;
&#13;
feel perfectly free to do that.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How does one stimulate debate?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, we give interviews to the press.     The press is now&#13;
&#13;
freer, not free but freer. That means that if I were to give&#13;
&#13;
a speech, that's critical of government, it would probably be&#13;
&#13;
printed now in Africa. I avoid doing that about a specific&#13;
&#13;
African government but I talk about African situations in&#13;
&#13;
generalities so that where the shoe fits, the message is&#13;
&amp;#12;                         WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95    Page 21&#13;
&#13;
heard. The trouble is the shoe fits all over the place, and&#13;
&#13;
everybody knows it.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   That's a fairly recent phenomenon.    You wouldn't have&#13;
&#13;
gotten that kind of publicity before.&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.   Not unless I was the most complimentary commen-&#13;
&#13;
tator. Except for the international press.    I mean, the&#13;
&#13;
international press was always looking for criticism of&#13;
&#13;
Africa and you had to watch it all the time because if you&#13;
&#13;
come across as only critical obviously you are not going to&#13;
&#13;
be very effective.    But the emphasis on governance is now&#13;
&#13;
accepted. We invented the application of that word in this&#13;
&#13;
Long-Term Perspective Study.    I can remember sitting around&#13;
&#13;
with seven or eight really serious, civilian Africans up in a&#13;
&#13;
hotel in Baltimore, and they said, "Look, you cannot publish&#13;
&#13;
a long-term perspective on African development unless you&#13;
&#13;
talk about the quality of government. The governments are a&#13;
&#13;
part of the problem, vampire state, the rapacious vampire&#13;
&#13;
state." This is the kind of language they were using with me,&#13;
&#13;
referring to "the corruption, the mismanagement, the&#13;
&#13;
tribalism, the shunning of professionalism, the shutting down&#13;
&amp;#12;                         WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95        Page 22&#13;
&#13;
of old active mines, the pushing away of young trained&#13;
&#13;
people. All of these things are, the real problem, and if you&#13;
&#13;
do not talk about these things you are not going to be&#13;
&#13;
believed by anybody in Africa.     That's Number One.     "If you&#13;
&#13;
do not talk about the issues you might as well quit."       So&#13;
&#13;
while we wondered about how we could get this into this&#13;
&#13;
report. This was a new departure for the World Bank, to write&#13;
&#13;
about something like this. Dunston Wai was interested in this&#13;
&#13;
angle of exterenal affairs for Africa.     He was there with me&#13;
&#13;
and we were going to search for a word that would talk about&#13;
&#13;
the quality of government.    This word "governance" came up.&#13;
&#13;
"Governance" is more broad.    It has a kind of a positive ring&#13;
&#13;
to it.   Governance is something that is positive.      It can be&#13;
&#13;
bad, but mostly when you talk about governance you tend to&#13;
&#13;
think in terms of the art.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   It is more of a technical term.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Right.   And it has a small "g."    It goes beyond&#13;
&#13;
"government" with a capital "G."&#13;
&#13;
Q:   "Governance" is a lot different than "government."&#13;
&amp;#12;                        WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95      Page 23&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yeah.   So we found this word, and I think we found the&#13;
&#13;
right word because the minute we got it, it went right into&#13;
&#13;
chapter 3 of the Long-term Perspective Study. The Bank has&#13;
&#13;
taken it up and we've talked about governance. Of course,&#13;
&#13;
there are those people who don't like it. In fact, maybe&#13;
&#13;
we've over-used this word now, but at the time it was&#13;
&#13;
capturing something that had not been discussed in polite&#13;
&#13;
circles about Africa, and all of a sudden it was center stage&#13;
&#13;
and indeed we've been dealing with it ever since.&#13;
&#13;
     The way we look at it is that governance has always been&#13;
&#13;
part of our work, in a project sense.   If you make a road&#13;
&#13;
loan, you are interested in the sanctity of the contract, you&#13;
&#13;
are interested in the transparency of the award, of the bid,&#13;
&#13;
the accountability ultimately for the contract and the&#13;
&#13;
procedures in the use of monies.   You are interested in the&#13;
&#13;
ownership by the government of this whole process.    In other&#13;
&#13;
words, governance covers most of the main elements, that&#13;
&#13;
we've got, accountability, transparency, the rule of law,&#13;
&#13;
predictability and sustained policy, the participation of the&#13;
&#13;
stakeholders in the decision-making process.   That's about as&#13;
&amp;#12;                         WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95     Page 24&#13;
&#13;
close as we get to democracy.     But if we can insist on those&#13;
&#13;
things in a project context, we've got all these little doors&#13;
&#13;
and windows into governance.&#13;
&#13;
     Now the issue is if we get into structural adjustment we&#13;
&#13;
are underwriting the whole economy and the gap is what we are&#13;
&#13;
filling.   That means, we have to worry about every nickel&#13;
&#13;
that comes in and goes out.     We have to worry about the&#13;
&#13;
accountability and the transparency and the constancy of&#13;
&#13;
policy, the whole bit.   So we are into governance.    We are&#13;
&#13;
into the issues.   And I think that many governments, in fact,&#13;
&#13;
not all democracies have those features, as we all well know.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Right.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Certainly not all governments that have multi-party&#13;
&#13;
elections backing them have all these features.     We are more&#13;
&#13;
concerned with the essence of the development role of the&#13;
&#13;
state rather than the taboos of political involvement, the&#13;
&#13;
things we want and the things we don't want when we talk&#13;
&#13;
about governance as opposed to democracy.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   On the question of taboos, there's a contradiction&#13;
&#13;
between getting deeper into the process of the societies,&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95     Page 25&#13;
&#13;
particularly with conditionality, and the idea of having&#13;
&#13;
greater client involvement.      There is a certain tension.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Right.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   When we interviewed Ernie I thought there was one very&#13;
&#13;
telling moment where I believe we provoked him, and he said,&#13;
&#13;
"You know, if they knew what to do they wouldn't need the&#13;
&#13;
money."     It was one of those blunt things that you say.     Did&#13;
&#13;
that come up as you developed your dialogue.?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, I think, there is always a tension between&#13;
&#13;
conditionality and ownership.      But, if you look at&#13;
&#13;
conditionality as a substitute for ownership, you are dead in&#13;
&#13;
the water.     I don't think that's going to work.   We've tried&#13;
&#13;
it, and we've got a lot of it, and those are the loans I wish&#13;
&#13;
I'd never signed.     In fact,   the whole study on adjustment in&#13;
&#13;
Africa shows that those loans didn't work.      That's why we had&#13;
&#13;
a lot of adjustment lending and very little adjustment.        So I&#13;
&#13;
think that we've changed the way we looked at things a long&#13;
&#13;
time ago.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Is that because you have now a better formula for&#13;
&#13;
structural adjustment ?&#13;
&amp;#12;                              WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95   Page 26&#13;
&#13;
A:      Well, no.     It is because we were trying to reform these&#13;
&#13;
economies.        Now, I've come to believe it's impossible for us&#13;
&#13;
to reform these economies.        We can only support people who&#13;
&#13;
are reforming these economies. But we cannot reform these&#13;
&#13;
economies.        There is a distinction there.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Right.&#13;
&#13;
A:      You see, if we decide what they have to do in order to&#13;
&#13;
get the money, that's a formula; it's a substitution of our&#13;
&#13;
commitment and ownership for theirs, and it's not going to&#13;
&#13;
work.        We are anxious about this because we see that time is&#13;
&#13;
money, we see that if they don't reform it's going to cost&#13;
&#13;
more, we are going to run out of money, we are going to run&#13;
&#13;
out of aid, aid fatigue will set in, these people will be&#13;
&#13;
written off. These are legitimate worries.        And yet, they&#13;
&#13;
have to actually do the reforming.        That's the way I look at&#13;
&#13;
it, anyway.&#13;
&#13;
        Q:      You didn't look at that, you didn't look at it&#13;
&#13;
exactly that way in 1987?&#13;
&#13;
A:      No.     Well, the point is you don't want to make the same&#13;
&#13;
mistakes over and over again.        If we make mistakes, I think&#13;
&amp;#12;                          WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95      Page 27&#13;
&#13;
we catch them early and don't repeat them twice.     I don't&#13;
&#13;
expect to avoid altogether making mistakes.     You've got to&#13;
&#13;
remember that we started with this Fund approach where the&#13;
&#13;
whole thing could be done in a few months.     But the Italian&#13;
&#13;
model was not going to work in Africa.     Some of us foresaw&#13;
&#13;
that.    Others hoped that we would get through this.    And&#13;
&#13;
maybe we believed, like the Africans that it was a temporary&#13;
&#13;
crisis, that it would be reversed, that the Americans&#13;
&#13;
wouldn't just say, disinflate the whole world economy. There&#13;
&#13;
were all kinds of things that might have happened if the&#13;
&#13;
world was managed in a different way.     But, it turned out to&#13;
&#13;
be a lot longer, a lot more painful, a lot deeper, the&#13;
&#13;
dangers of adjustment became that we might do it in a wrong,&#13;
&#13;
improper way rather than support real adjustment.       But we saw&#13;
&#13;
the mistakes after a while.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Presumably the Africans also began to look at things&#13;
&#13;
differently?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Oh, sure.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Initially they may have said why should we do this? It&#13;
&#13;
hurtG.&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95       Page 28&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.     And the world is unfair and you've caused all&#13;
&#13;
these problems anyway, for God's sakes.      Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   And eventually they came to recognize that they really&#13;
&#13;
didn't have any options.&#13;
&#13;
A:   That's right.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   --but to confront these problems.&#13;
&#13;
A:   I think that's correct.      So we didn't have to do all the&#13;
&#13;
reforming by ourselves.     That's another thing that evolved.&#13;
&#13;
But I still think that the real tension, is between the&#13;
&#13;
agenda that we have and the agenda that the Africans have.&#13;
&#13;
We are under pressure from the people who provide our&#13;
&#13;
resources and govern our Bank, the majority of votes, to get&#13;
&#13;
these economies reformed.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Right.    Achieve results.&#13;
&#13;
A:   To get these girls in school, and get these birthrates&#13;
&#13;
down, and get these environmental action programs in full&#13;
&#13;
swing.    If you go to Africa there's no African minister,&#13;
&#13;
there's no African, there's hardly any African that has that&#13;
&#13;
agenda.     They are looking for where their next square meal is&#13;
&#13;
going to come from. And what's in it for me?         You know, this&#13;
&amp;#12;                         WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95      Page 29&#13;
&#13;
reflects the breakdown of their tribal culture, and we've&#13;
&#13;
reached it pretty fast in some of those places.     But my point&#13;
&#13;
is that our agenda doesn't match with theirs, so reform is a&#13;
&#13;
very tricky thing.   The vast majority never goes for reform.&#13;
&#13;
 It's always a tiny minority that starts this process&#13;
&#13;
anywhere. Certainly that's true inside the Bank as it is out.&#13;
&#13;
 A tiny minority thinks they have the guts and the will and&#13;
&#13;
the determination to make changes.   The   mass are fine.    I&#13;
&#13;
mean, the status quo is the way it is, and they've all made&#13;
&#13;
peace with that or they are voiceless.     So when we get this&#13;
&#13;
movement, we start supporting this tiny minority. Sometimes&#13;
&#13;
this tiny minority needs the conditions in order to force the&#13;
&#13;
rest of the cabinets or the rest of the government or, the&#13;
&#13;
labor unions, or the customs collectors to straighten up and&#13;
&#13;
fly right.   They need that conditionality.    By God, if we do&#13;
&#13;
not do this, if you do not do this, the World Bank is going&#13;
&#13;
to stop the flow of money.   So we end up putting these&#13;
&#13;
conditions on, not only because we want to reform these&#13;
&#13;
economies but we are trying to support those who do.&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95    Page 30&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I'm going to stop you right there for just a second. How&#13;
&#13;
good is your intelligence that you get on the political&#13;
&#13;
implications of, say, conditionality of the sort you were&#13;
&#13;
just talking about?.&#13;
&#13;
A:   I think we have very good intelligence.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Do you?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.     We are probably not experts enough.   We ought to&#13;
&#13;
have more information.     But I don't think there are many&#13;
&#13;
surprises.     The thing is that we are in this hard situation&#13;
&#13;
and the implementation is in the hands of the weaker partner.&#13;
&#13;
 They have to implement.     If they make one false move in&#13;
&#13;
Zambia, if they don't come across with a program that's&#13;
&#13;
credible to the millers, to mill what they call the "roller-&#13;
&#13;
meal", they messed i.t up.    The whole damn thing comes apart&#13;
&#13;
and because of this, our Board sometimes says we don't have&#13;
&#13;
enough conditions while in reality we have too many&#13;
&#13;
conditions.     If we had tried to save the day in Zambia by&#13;
&#13;
telling them how to tie their shoes, you can imagine the&#13;
&#13;
uproar that we would be having about our legal documents&#13;
&#13;
cluttered up with this kind of minutiae. But in fact that's&#13;
&amp;#12;                         WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95      Page 31&#13;
&#13;
where this thing in fact began to unravel big time.    This was&#13;
&#13;
a disaster, from my point of view.   It set the whole thing&#13;
&#13;
back five years, and made what we are doing now in Zambia&#13;
&#13;
just that much more difficult.&#13;
&#13;
     My point is that this tension between ownership and&#13;
&#13;
conditionality is extremely tricky, at least in Africa.     And&#13;
&#13;
I'm sure this is true anywhere where the government is weak,&#13;
&#13;
where the reforming mentality is fragile with few supporters,&#13;
&#13;
where they need a lot of outside support to be successful,&#13;
&#13;
and where the urgency is so great because the alternatives to&#13;
&#13;
adjustment are a chaotic and extremely painful development&#13;
&#13;
for the society at large.   We've got enough of that in&#13;
&#13;
Africa, and we cannot afford to leave that unattended.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   From whom are you getting your best feedback in terms of&#13;
&#13;
ideas and information?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Our customers.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Any particular people that you've identified as being&#13;
&#13;
particularly important in terms of feedback? You've talked&#13;
&#13;
about how the first part of the structural adjustment ran&#13;
&#13;
into problems and that you felt you needed to get information&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95      Page 32&#13;
&#13;
about this, and I'd like a little bit more on your sources of&#13;
&#13;
information.    There must have been certain people you really&#13;
&#13;
found superb.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, first of all, I think the staff is an important&#13;
&#13;
source. This goes back to before the reorganization, that the&#13;
&#13;
team working on Africa was always a relatively close-knit&#13;
&#13;
team providing close communication with what's going on out&#13;
&#13;
there in the field. We have 30 resident missions now in the&#13;
&#13;
combined Africa; we've got 400 people working in the field,&#13;
&#13;
in different time zones.     We are practically 24 hours around&#13;
&#13;
the clock working on Africa.&#13;
&#13;
     We also set up this Council of African Advisors that&#13;
&#13;
comes twice a year and gives us a straight assessment from&#13;
&#13;
their point of view.   We are definitely reached out by doing&#13;
&#13;
an awful lot of traveling.     The motto of the Africa region is&#13;
&#13;
"If you don't go you don't know."     There's no point in&#13;
&#13;
sitting around here expecting to know anything.     You are not&#13;
&#13;
going to know anything by sitting behind this desk.      That's&#13;
&#13;
clear.   However, the one consistent theme I've got in my&#13;
&#13;
annual evaluation was that "You travel too much, Jaycox.       You&#13;
&amp;#12;                         WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95     Page 33&#13;
&#13;
are never here when we need you."     Whatever the hell that&#13;
&#13;
means. I don't think they need me around here at all. You&#13;
&#13;
really have to be out in the field.     I get feedback from&#13;
&#13;
ministers, feedback from heads of state.     A lot of this is&#13;
&#13;
inarticulate and problematical and self-serving from their&#13;
&#13;
point of view.    But it is all extremely valuable feedback,&#13;
&#13;
from my point of view.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   There is a tendency for people to cover their ass, and&#13;
&#13;
that, indirectly, was the question I was asking.     How do you&#13;
&#13;
deal with that?   You've got a lot of people and you've got a&#13;
&#13;
lot of money, and you've got a lot of different people with&#13;
&#13;
very different perspectives and motives. Is that the key,&#13;
&#13;
that you keep on the move, that you talk to enough people and&#13;
&#13;
you get 18 different stories, and then you sift them out?&#13;
&#13;
A:   The way we have actually set this thing up really&#13;
&#13;
maximizes the number of inputs, the sources of input.    We&#13;
&#13;
meet twice a year with interested donors on all these&#13;
&#13;
countries, donors who have field offices and points of view&#13;
&#13;
and complaints about the World Bank.    We meet in the field,&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95      Page 34&#13;
&#13;
and I do a lot of traveling. The directors also do a lot of&#13;
&#13;
traveling, and visit all of these donors in the process.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      But do the donors ask difficult questions of you?&#13;
&#13;
A:      I think we are constantly under fire. The anecdotal&#13;
&#13;
evidence that they gather, the concerns that they have, they&#13;
&#13;
register everything here with us.     We are not immune from&#13;
&#13;
that.     The customers also have complete access to us here.&#13;
&#13;
We meet with them a lot in the field, and we meet with them&#13;
&#13;
here.     I think communications are good.   We have all these&#13;
&#13;
resident missions.     I think we are the only region, until&#13;
&#13;
very recently the only one, that had anywhere near like this&#13;
&#13;
establishment in the countries, and the job there is to&#13;
&#13;
communicate reality.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      And that's because of the problems of Africa, that you&#13;
&#13;
have more resident missions.&#13;
&#13;
A:      That's because all these countries have structural&#13;
&#13;
adjustment programs and because of all the handholding that&#13;
&#13;
is required, including the feedback that you are mentioning.&#13;
&#13;
 Now, in fact I have at times felt that I was not getting&#13;
&#13;
reality, that I was being sold the Pollyannish stories. This&#13;
&amp;#12;'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95      Page 35&#13;
&#13;
    is a very serious problem, generally in any bureaucracy. But&#13;
&#13;
    I don't think it's a huge problem in this region. I hope it's&#13;
&#13;
    not a huge problem.&#13;
&#13;
    Q:   You know, you are talking about the structural&#13;
&#13;
    adjustment loans and there is a provision that you can't use&#13;
&#13;
    them directly for debt relief.     Is that the case?&#13;
&#13;
    A:   But that's what we are doing.    We providing debt relief.&#13;
&#13;
         Well, there is no direct debt relief. If you look at&#13;
&#13;
    this SPA document you'll see the total needs of the country,&#13;
&#13;
    including its unavoidable debt payments, the imports required&#13;
&#13;
    for investment and for consumption and to achieve per capita,&#13;
&#13;
    positive per capita income growth.    You add those things&#13;
&#13;
    together.   That's their total requirements in the way of&#13;
&#13;
    money foreign exchange.    And then you've got all these&#13;
&#13;
    outflows including the unavoidable debt payments.       In some&#13;
&#13;
    countries these unavoidable debt payments are huge. But we&#13;
&#13;
    regard them as a legitimate expenditure, you can't regard&#13;
&#13;
    them as somebody else's problem.     Now, the gaps are defined&#13;
&#13;
    in a way that we can associate this money with the imports,&#13;
&#13;
    but in fact in some countries, like Zambia, there's no doubt&#13;
&amp;#12;                         WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95     Page 36&#13;
&#13;
that the amount of money required is greater than the gap&#13;
&#13;
that is required to finance imports. So external assistance&#13;
&#13;
has to go for legitimate debt service, including our own&#13;
&#13;
debt, although we are extremely positive.   So we are paying&#13;
&#13;
other people's debts in addition to the imports.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   We are now coming under fire from these Christian&#13;
&#13;
alliances who claim that our debt really represents the hub&#13;
&#13;
of the problem.&#13;
&#13;
A:   That's wrong. It's numerically correct, but it's a red&#13;
&#13;
herring. I think we'll have to somehow deal with that.    This&#13;
&#13;
has been analyzed to death in fact. What we are doing is we&#13;
&#13;
are substituting World Bank debt for other people's debt. We&#13;
&#13;
are paying off the Paris Club, we are paying off the IMF, we&#13;
&#13;
are paying off the African Development Bank, and where the&#13;
&#13;
hell do they think the money is coming from?   It's coming&#13;
&#13;
from us.   And it's also coming from the SPA donors who are&#13;
&#13;
giving it in the form of a grant.   So this money doesn't show&#13;
&#13;
up as debt. But our one dollar of debt. What goes in is 40&#13;
&#13;
years, 10 years grace, 3/4 of one percent, and it's going in&#13;
&#13;
to replace debt that is four years, 14 percent, four points&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95      Page 37&#13;
&#13;
above LIBOR.     Our money replaces the most expensive crap that&#13;
&#13;
is out there.     It's what's on the books of these African&#13;
&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   But that means that they are then borrowing money at&#13;
&#13;
this time?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No, no.     They are not.   This is all old debt.    In fact,&#13;
&#13;
a lot of it is the capitalization of interest that has not&#13;
&#13;
been paid previously. Once it gets rescheduled, it's beyond&#13;
&#13;
the cut-off and cannot be rescheduled again. It really builds&#13;
&#13;
up. Now, we are trying to change these things.      It's very&#13;
&#13;
much in the interest of IDA, and the Bank, to get this debt,&#13;
&#13;
this heavy, hard debt, out of these economies, because until&#13;
&#13;
we get rid of this debt, our money is going to go to pay off&#13;
&#13;
this debt.     We've got to have a reduction in order to make&#13;
&#13;
sure that our money in fact goes for development;        I think&#13;
&#13;
the NGOs have got it, absolutely upside down.      They do not&#13;
&#13;
understand the role that the Bank has played in this debt&#13;
&#13;
business.    We have been the sherpa.    We have been developing&#13;
&#13;
the ideas.     If you go back to the Trinidad or the Toronto&#13;
&#13;
terms, the Enhanced Trinidad terms, the Naples terms for&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95     Page 38&#13;
&#13;
rescheduling, these were all ideas that were developed here.&#13;
&#13;
 Of course, we are not necessarily successful in every case.&#13;
&#13;
 We have not got always found the consensus readily among&#13;
&#13;
donors and creditors.     But, the idea that we are interested&#13;
&#13;
in holding the feet of some country to the fire so that they&#13;
&#13;
pay their debts is just absolutely wrong.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   It is a very common complaint because even the&#13;
&#13;
Chancellor of the Exchequer is making these noises.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yeah.     Well, the commercial debt is the worst aspect,&#13;
&#13;
but we've got to look at the total debt service. There's a&#13;
&#13;
lot of IDA money out there now in this whole debt.       But what&#13;
&#13;
kind of debt is this, with all these huge grace periods and&#13;
&#13;
no interest practically?&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Soft debt as opposed to hard debt.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yeah.     You don't add them together to make two, these&#13;
&#13;
two dollars.     It's a very different kind of debt. I just&#13;
&#13;
don't think that the thing has been analyzed correctly. We've&#13;
&#13;
written books about it.&#13;
&amp;#12;â&#128;¢.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95   Page 39&#13;
&#13;
     Q:   One area where progress must be made is on these old&#13;
&#13;
     debts whether they are short-term or long-term including our&#13;
&#13;
     own Bank debt.&#13;
&#13;
     A:   Yeah.    And we are getting rid of the Bank debt. We've&#13;
&#13;
     got the fifth dimension, that's part of SPA. These dimensions&#13;
&#13;
     you may hear about; first, second, and third. First is debt&#13;
&#13;
     relief, second is the SPA, or maybe the first is SPA and the&#13;
&#13;
     second is debt relief.     But under the fifth dimension the&#13;
&#13;
     reflows to IDA are used to buy down World Bank debt in&#13;
&#13;
     countries where we, the Bank, as distinct from IDA won't be&#13;
&#13;
     lending anymore, and has not been for some time. Before these&#13;
&#13;
     countries went into freefall they were creditworthy, so they&#13;
&#13;
     did have some debt, and this was relatively long-term, 20-&#13;
&#13;
     year debt or more, sometimes 25.     So there are a few payments&#13;
&#13;
     left in some of these countries.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:   Tanzania had some, Zambia had Bank debt.&#13;
&#13;
     A:   Right.     These countries are now repaying these loans&#13;
&#13;
     with interest with the new money.    We are adding special&#13;
&#13;
     allocations of IDA reflew money to these countries to get rid&#13;
&#13;
     of that debt.     Now, we are also buying down the private debt&#13;
&amp;#12;                          WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95      Page 40&#13;
&#13;
at a deep discount.    I've got seven countries in Africa, in&#13;
&#13;
this program, this is the sixth dimension.     The sixth&#13;
&#13;
dimension is a debt reduction operation which deals with&#13;
&#13;
private but publicly-guaranteed debt.     We try to clear it.&#13;
&#13;
It's like going after an elephant herd. The deal there is we&#13;
&#13;
make an offer and try to make. a deal. On the average we have&#13;
&#13;
paid about nine cents on the dollar.    We buy it all.     We&#13;
&#13;
usually put in $10 million and then other donors put in as&#13;
&#13;
much as they like.    The Swedes are very good at this.     The&#13;
&#13;
Swiss and others have come to the party with similar amounts&#13;
&#13;
of money.   And we've bought all the private debt outstanding&#13;
&#13;
in a country.   Niger, Mozambique, Tanzania, I think we'll be&#13;
&#13;
moving on to. Of course there is no transfer of money to&#13;
&#13;
these coutries because they are not paying this debt.       The&#13;
&#13;
cash flow consequences are zero.    If they were paying the&#13;
&#13;
debt we couldn't buy it for nine cents.&#13;
&#13;
     So we are just clearing it out.    The feedback we get&#13;
&#13;
from the debtors, is however very positive. They say:"Okay,&#13;
&#13;
we are indebted and we can't pay. But the debt is building in&#13;
&#13;
terms of its principal because we don't pay the interest.&#13;
&amp;#12;                         WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95    Page 41&#13;
&#13;
That gets capitalized.   And it's growing fast, because it's&#13;
&#13;
capitalized at eight percent. It's growing much faster than&#13;
&#13;
our economy, so, there's no way we are ever going to be able&#13;
&#13;
to repay it. So let's get it out of there."   The private&#13;
&#13;
entrepreneur who may want to invest in this country, all he&#13;
&#13;
sees is this,   unpaid debt and the fact that these other&#13;
&#13;
creditors were there first and are going to have a prior&#13;
&#13;
claim on any revenues.   Of course, the reformer sees that and&#13;
&#13;
he says, "Oh, my God, you know, if I reform and I get a&#13;
&#13;
little success these guys are going to suddenly wake up to&#13;
&#13;
the fact that they've got debt in this country and they are&#13;
&#13;
going to swoop in here and take the benefit of all the effort&#13;
&#13;
that I'm making, even though it was my predecessor twice&#13;
&#13;
removed that incurred this debt.   There's no point in trying&#13;
&#13;
very hard to reform this economy under these conditions."&#13;
&#13;
That's why we've got to get the debt out of there.     So that's&#13;
&#13;
what we are doing.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I want to ask about the Wapenhans Report and what input&#13;
&#13;
you had into that report&#13;
&amp;#12;                        WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95      Page 42&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, we had tremendous input because before the&#13;
&#13;
Wapenhans Report was even commissioned, we had had a number&#13;
&#13;
of very bad news kind of reports coming out of OED and out of&#13;
&#13;
our own portfolio review, our annual review. These were&#13;
&#13;
showing us that the portfolio in Africa was not succeeding&#13;
&#13;
and in fact I think our agriculture sector in Africa was the&#13;
&#13;
worst portfolio in the Bank.    It was something like only 52&#13;
&#13;
percent of the projects being a success.    This was probably&#13;
&#13;
stretching it.   The reasons for some of this had to do with&#13;
&#13;
the poor economic context because when domestic prices went&#13;
&#13;
into hyperinflation and export commodity prices declined, the&#13;
&#13;
combination of that and the slow movement of the exchange&#13;
&#13;
rate meant that these countries were cutting their links with&#13;
&#13;
the world market. It also meant that a lot of our projects,&#13;
&#13;
even those that depended on road traffic, were not&#13;
&#13;
performing, not generating enough benefits or revenue.    So,&#13;
&#13;
we were very unhappy with this.    Also, we were finding that&#13;
&#13;
disbursements were lagging.    We had at one point $13 billion&#13;
&#13;
tied up in accounts.   In Nigeria we had over $2.5 billion, I&#13;
&#13;
think almost $3 billion. This also reflected a lack of&#13;
&amp;#12;                               WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95   Page 43&#13;
&#13;
institutional capacity.         Sometimes corruption interfered.&#13;
&#13;
They couldn't award contracts because they couldn't figure&#13;
&#13;
out how to get their own money out of it.         Our transparency&#13;
&#13;
and accountability rules stifled them so they didn't award&#13;
&#13;
these contracts.      And in some countries it was as bad as&#13;
&#13;
that.     So we launched a number of efforts to deal with this&#13;
&#13;
problem.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      You started this about when?      Can you fix in on the&#13;
&#13;
time?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Yeah.   I think '91,    '92. And that was when the Wapenhans&#13;
&#13;
effort started.      We had a team already focused on the problem&#13;
&#13;
and they participated in the Wapenhans Report Task Force.&#13;
&#13;
They looked at best practices, like mid-term review on&#13;
&#13;
projects, special in-country portfolio review sessions etc.&#13;
&#13;
In fact this was already common practice in the Africa&#13;
&#13;
region.     The issue of ownership and participation, we'd just&#13;
&#13;
started that. But now we have one department that's 100&#13;
&#13;
percent and we intend to be 100 percent by the end of '96.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      One hundred percent of what?&#13;
&amp;#12;                          WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95    Page 44&#13;
&#13;
A:   Beneficiary participation in the projects. Quality at&#13;
&#13;
entry was as much of importance as portfolio management, of&#13;
&#13;
course.   I think we've made a big contribution toward the&#13;
&#13;
Wapenhans Report.   We had no difficulty with the finding.&#13;
&#13;
There's only one minor issue which I think is important,&#13;
&#13;
where I don't agree with the Wapenhans Report and we are not&#13;
&#13;
going to implement it.    We can't afford to implement that,&#13;
&#13;
and to me it sends the wrong signals, and that has to do with&#13;
&#13;
co-financing.   Co-financing is absolutely essential in the&#13;
&#13;
Africa region. But the problem for our borrowers is not so&#13;
&#13;
much our portfolio as much as their portfolio.     I mean the&#13;
&#13;
country's portfolio.     In Uganda we have 2,300 projects, all&#13;
&#13;
of them financed by donors. But Uganda doesn't have enough&#13;
&#13;
shillings under these programs to finance their part.        The&#13;
&#13;
donors are all hounding and competing for those limited&#13;
&#13;
shillings and for unlimited Ugandan managers. I'm just using&#13;
&#13;
Uganda;   you can put any country there.&#13;
&#13;
     Their portfolio is a complete chaos.     A tremendous&#13;
&#13;
overhang of unfinished and unfinishable projects, with no&#13;
&#13;
management and no prospect of success.&#13;
&amp;#12;                          WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95    Page 45&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What do you do with an unfinishable project?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, if it's supported by a donor who is dead-set on&#13;
&#13;
hanging in there competing for their shillings, nothing.       It&#13;
&#13;
just hangs there and eventually I don't know what happens.&#13;
&#13;
The point is that we broke the camel's back a long time ago&#13;
&#13;
by putting one straw on top of another and nobody paying&#13;
&#13;
attention to the total weight, the macro implications of what&#13;
&#13;
they were doing.   Macro in the sense of management or&#13;
&#13;
institutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
     So my view is that co-financing is the highest form of&#13;
&#13;
coordination.   What we do is by co-financing we reduce the&#13;
&#13;
number of projects. We enhance the focus of donor money, and&#13;
&#13;
we get the projects appraised in the appropriate context&#13;
&#13;
appropriate, i.e., the macro framework.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Right.&#13;
&#13;
A:   We don't do anything that we don't think we can finish.&#13;
&#13;
 I'm all for co-financing because I think it upgrades the&#13;
&#13;
portfolio of the borrower and it upgrades the quality of the&#13;
&#13;
donors' assistance.   This may sound arrogant, but if we&#13;
&#13;
didn't do it we would hope somebody else did it.    Somebody&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95       Page 46&#13;
&#13;
has to provide this vehicle for getting a higher quality&#13;
&#13;
assistance.     And since everything is donor driven now,&#13;
&#13;
there's virtually no investment taking place in these&#13;
&#13;
countries that is not the brainchild of some donor.         Donor-&#13;
&#13;
driven is what we call it.      So the idea is to get this donor-&#13;
&#13;
driven program more focused and to be of higher quality.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Do you agree with Wapenhans' analysis of the reasons&#13;
&#13;
that led to this problem?     Do you agree that there is a&#13;
&#13;
culture with emphasis on quantity rather than quality?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yeah.     I do.   I think that's part of it.   That's a real&#13;
&#13;
syndrome.     That goes into personnel, skill mix, issues,&#13;
&#13;
everything.     And it comes back to the definition of the&#13;
&#13;
project as of the product of this Bank.      Is our product this&#13;
&#13;
report?     This appraisal report?   Or is our product what the&#13;
&#13;
results are on the ground out there in Africa?       It's&#13;
&#13;
obviously the latter.     That's the way we ultimately will be&#13;
&#13;
judged.     But the reports are the focus of our staff&#13;
&#13;
incentives.     They are the focus of what drives the budgets of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank.     Talking about budgets, I've done a rough back-of-&#13;
&#13;
the-envelope calculation. Taking my entire budget and my&#13;
&amp;#12;                         WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95        Page 47&#13;
&#13;
entire portfolio and dividing it by the number of projects&#13;
&#13;
that we approve and supervise, and we have about $1 million&#13;
&#13;
per project in the administrative budget.    We've spent 75&#13;
&#13;
percent of that by the time we get to the Board.     And we've&#13;
&#13;
got eight years of implementation to go.     The idea that a&#13;
&#13;
project is going to look like what we have described in that&#13;
&#13;
report eight years from now is preposterous.     Not in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
 If it did it would be another project.     That project has to&#13;
&#13;
be redesigned probably twice if it's going to be successful&#13;
&#13;
in eight years.    I'm not talking about a simple road project.&#13;
&#13;
But the attempts at institution building and capacity&#13;
&#13;
building are all built into the project.     It has to be&#13;
&#13;
redesigned at least twice.    But don't have the resources;&#13;
&#13;
we've spent all the resources getting the damn thing&#13;
&#13;
approved.    This is obviously wrong.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Is that changing now?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yeah.    That's changing now, but it takes time. I'll tell&#13;
&#13;
you, it is very hard to get more flexible sounding appraisal&#13;
&#13;
reports, shorter things with less polish, less detail and&#13;
&#13;
getting the people on board that are willing and able to&#13;
&amp;#12;                         WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95   Page 48&#13;
&#13;
spend most of their time in the field as opposed to here,&#13;
&#13;
people who don't worry about whether they are glib enough to&#13;
&#13;
present something to the Board but whether they know enough&#13;
&#13;
to actually design these projects and help these people get&#13;
&#13;
results on the ground.&#13;
&#13;
      We are rewarding generalists here very strongly because&#13;
&#13;
of the way we are organized, the way our product is defined&#13;
&#13;
incorrectly. The generalist is the overall guy. He may not&#13;
&#13;
know anything about getting results on the ground, but he can&#13;
&#13;
get a decision, he can talk people into things, and he may be&#13;
&#13;
pretty good with the government too, by the way, in policy&#13;
&#13;
reform and all that. But the thing is we are rewarding him&#13;
&#13;
not for the policy reform but for the reports he writes, and&#13;
&#13;
as a result his energies are concentrated in the wrong place.&#13;
&#13;
 When we get a finished product in terms of recommendations&#13;
&#13;
to a government on policy the thing should be a dirty white&#13;
&#13;
cover. That's when it should be discussed with the&#13;
&#13;
government, when it's still in draft.   If the government&#13;
&#13;
needs further work in order to be convinced, we ought to do&#13;
&#13;
it.   If they don't get convinced, we ought to stop there.&#13;
&amp;#12;                         WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95      Page 49&#13;
&#13;
The time we spend going to gray and green cover of a report&#13;
&#13;
that finally ends up on some shelf in Iowa University is a&#13;
&#13;
waste. Yet, that's about half of the cost, and that half is&#13;
&#13;
providing no value-added whatsoever as far as results on the&#13;
&#13;
ground in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   But you still have the process of going to the Board and&#13;
&#13;
country strategy discussions and PFP?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yeah, but I think we could systematically starve this&#13;
&#13;
beast.   Just put it on a steady diet and after 10 years this&#13;
&#13;
will require less caloric intake than it does today.      You&#13;
&#13;
will be satisfied with less food for thought.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Is that something that you are doing because you are&#13;
&#13;
recognizing this has to be done?     Or is that something that&#13;
&#13;
you view as a signal from the top of the organization?&#13;
&#13;
A:   This is the Mickey Mouse end of this. It's the change&#13;
&#13;
agenda for the Africa region.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Yeah.   I've got one of those. I studied that very&#13;
&#13;
carefully, I must tell you.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Did I give you that before?     We are serious.   We started&#13;
&#13;
with Benor's operations in Africa.     We are trying to make a&#13;
&amp;#12;                         WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95   Page 50&#13;
&#13;
report, a five-page report, the total reporting requirement.&#13;
&#13;
 This is a cookie-cutter thing.   It's really a system and all&#13;
&#13;
you have to do is change the name of the country and the&#13;
&#13;
numbers.   There's no reason to write any poetry about this.&#13;
&#13;
We do not have to describe our inventory of the whole goddamn&#13;
&#13;
agricultural sector to make these cookie-cutter loans which&#13;
&#13;
are obviously right on the mark, so why bother?   Who are we&#13;
&#13;
doing this for?   The Africans don't need this, and we don't&#13;
&#13;
either.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You do it for the top.&#13;
&#13;
A:   They don't need it either.   They could just read them,&#13;
&#13;
but what we intend to do is persuade them that they don't&#13;
&#13;
need the reports, that they can rely on the product. But we&#13;
&#13;
are having a little trouble with that.   There has been a lot&#13;
&#13;
of criticism of the extension process lately, but I haven't&#13;
&#13;
figured out the source of that.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You called it a real syndrome. Now, looking back from&#13;
&#13;
1995, to what extent was that syndrome produced by McNamara's&#13;
&#13;
changes in the Bank?&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95    Page 51&#13;
&#13;
A:   I think that what McNamara did was the beginning of&#13;
&#13;
this, it's the way the thing was managed more than the focus&#13;
&#13;
on project approval as such.     The idea that we should be&#13;
&#13;
sitting here waiting for everybody to come and that resource&#13;
&#13;
transfer is not part of our job is ridiculous.     We have an&#13;
&#13;
obligation to move these resources in a timely fashion.        They&#13;
&#13;
are entrusted to us and we should move them.     These countries&#13;
&#13;
need them and they are urgently required.     There is no reason&#13;
&#13;
for us to be going limp.     We have to be aggressively trying&#13;
&#13;
to make development happen.     That means money, numbers of&#13;
&#13;
projects, pressure.    It's appropriate I think to have&#13;
&#13;
pressure.    Now, on the other hand, where is the pressure for&#13;
&#13;
quality?    Where is the pressure for ownership? We are just&#13;
&#13;
getting this thing back into some proper framework.       It was&#13;
&#13;
rather open-ended and going the wrong way in my opinion.&#13;
&#13;
That's the way I look at it.&#13;
&#13;
     I've had this argument 50 times since McNamara left.&#13;
&#13;
But if you think about what the Bank was like before&#13;
&#13;
McNamara, then I don't think those were the "good old days,"&#13;
&#13;
as far as I'm concerned.&#13;
&amp;#12;                         WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95     Page 52&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Right. No, I'm not saying that, but as historians, we&#13;
&#13;
are always looking for something that breaks at a certain&#13;
&#13;
point in time.&#13;
&#13;
A:   I think that we've had that break. I think it was&#13;
&#13;
Preston's influence.   From my perspective right now, it was&#13;
&#13;
Lew Preston.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Well, now going back to the Wapenhans Report, when I&#13;
&#13;
read that the numbers on agriculture were disappointing, it&#13;
&#13;
didn't surprise me. Because if you look over the whole world,&#13;
&#13;
everybody's efforts to change agriculture have failed. If&#13;
&#13;
communism failed in any one place it was in agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
     It seems they spent decade after decade re-educating the&#13;
&#13;
agriculturalists. The United States Department of Agriculture&#13;
&#13;
invested literally billions of dollars for decades in the&#13;
&#13;
agricultural system and got very little productivity change&#13;
&#13;
until the Second World War came along. Then all of a sudden&#13;
&#13;
all of that surplus was used, so it was a wonderful thing&#13;
&#13;
then. So the disappointment in agriculture didn't surprise&#13;
&#13;
me, just from what I know about agriculture and how difficult&#13;
&#13;
it is to change it.&#13;
&amp;#12;                         WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95     Page 53&#13;
&#13;
     The one sector that did surprise me was water supply and&#13;
&#13;
sanitation. Apparently those projects got into an enormous&#13;
&#13;
amount of trouble, and those statistics on, on what the&#13;
&#13;
Wapenhans Report called "major problems" were as high for&#13;
&#13;
those projects as they were for agriculture. I couldn't&#13;
&#13;
understand that.   Was that noticeable in Africa?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, the Africa situation I don't think that water&#13;
&#13;
supply was a particularly weak sector.    But, maybe it was.      I&#13;
&#13;
was mesmerized by the agriculture sector because I regard&#13;
&#13;
agriculture as so crucial in Africa that I wasn't going to&#13;
&#13;
live with that another minute.   By the way, that's changed.&#13;
&#13;
We now have the second strongest portfolio in agriculture in&#13;
&#13;
the Bank. That's partly due to getting out some of these dogs&#13;
&#13;
but a lot of it has to do with really turning these projects&#13;
                                                                      ....&#13;
around one by one at a tremendous cost.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How do you turn projects around?&#13;
&#13;
A:   We went in and restructured every one of them.      And we&#13;
&#13;
turned the area-specific and the crop-specific investments&#13;
&#13;
into more general services, a systemic approach.    We&#13;
&amp;#12;                         WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95     Page 54&#13;
&#13;
cancelled a lot of projects and immediately redesigned them&#13;
&#13;
back in place.   We consolidated the extension services.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   When you consolidated the extension services, what did&#13;
&#13;
you do?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Take Kenya, for example, the darling of the donor&#13;
&#13;
community until recently.   They had 11 separate extension&#13;
&#13;
services, each of them donor-driven, in Kenya.     If I'm not&#13;
&#13;
mistaken, we also had three in there.   Because we had area-&#13;
&#13;
specific kind of operations.   For instance, that Bora Bora&#13;
&#13;
Project, it had it's own extension service.     It was not part&#13;
&#13;
of the National extension service.   It's a big irrigation&#13;
&#13;
scheme and we had an extension service there.     It had its own&#13;
&#13;
little research station, it had its own vehicles and offices&#13;
&#13;
and officers and all the overheads. It turned out there was&#13;
&#13;
no output.   So that was not a successful project. Apart from&#13;
&#13;
ourselves, the donors all had their crop-specific, area-&#13;
&#13;
specific, sometimes gender-specific extension services. None&#13;
&#13;
of these had anything to do with each other.     They were not&#13;
&#13;
linked to sources of knowledge, domestically anyway.     They&#13;
&#13;
had no links to a research center, so there was no system&#13;
&amp;#12;                            WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95   Page 55&#13;
&#13;
there.     It was not adapted to Kenya.   This is where we had&#13;
&#13;
to, instead of just fixing our own portfolio, fix the&#13;
&#13;
portfolio of Kenya, and then knock everybody's heads&#13;
&#13;
together. We had to bring this all into one extension&#13;
&#13;
service, the National Extension Service.      If anybody was not&#13;
&#13;
aligned with that, we got the Kenyans to assert themselves&#13;
&#13;
and say, "By God, we have an Extension Service.      There is no&#13;
&#13;
other Extension Service.      You guys are either in this or you&#13;
&#13;
are out altogether."      Finally the donors found their way into&#13;
&#13;
the system.     They still have their little areas, but they are&#13;
&#13;
conforming to this system at last. Similarly, in research we&#13;
&#13;
had a half a dozen systems, and also different credit&#13;
&#13;
systems.     We had the Japanese passing money on directly from&#13;
&#13;
the taxpayers in Japan to credit systems where the farmer got&#13;
&#13;
free credit.     Wow!   You know, that meant the farmer threw big&#13;
&#13;
weddings for his kids.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   He withdrew that money for his kids?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yeah.     There were some donors insisting on market rates&#13;
&#13;
and then others had subsidized rates. There were all these&#13;
&#13;
different crop-specific, area-specific, gender-specific,&#13;
&amp;#12;                         WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95      Page 56&#13;
&#13;
farmer size-specific credit schemes, all over the country.&#13;
&#13;
No consolidation.   This had a big impact on the financial&#13;
&#13;
system as basically these schemes didn't work, and were a&#13;
&#13;
drain on the public budget.    We consolidated that.    We fixed&#13;
&#13;
these things.   And it was very painful.    It took us three or&#13;
&#13;
four years of solid work.     It was more important than any of&#13;
&#13;
the new lending, as far as I'm concerned.     So, we did change&#13;
&#13;
the culture, and I hope we can keep it that way.&#13;
&#13;
     Of course, this year we are supposed to do 80 projects.&#13;
&#13;
We are only going to do 63.     One of these days somebody is&#13;
&#13;
going to say, "Hey, now, wait a minute, you know.      Where the&#13;
&#13;
hell are these 80 projects you are supposed to be approving?"&#13;
&#13;
 So I expect the pendulum to come back.     But right now the&#13;
&#13;
pressure is off on lending, and Lew Preston and Ernie and I&#13;
&#13;
think the Vice Presidents tried to transmit that down.&#13;
&#13;
     At the Department and the Division level they still see&#13;
&#13;
the budget driven by the number of approvals. So there is a&#13;
&#13;
constant tension between the upper management saying, "Look,&#13;
&#13;
what we want is results on the ground, and you are going to&#13;
&#13;
get the budget that you need. Just be accurate in your&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95   Page 57&#13;
&#13;
projections."     Of course they say, "Well, if we only have&#13;
&#13;
eight projects in this Department that means we are going to&#13;
&#13;
have to cut X number of staff.     We don't want to do that&#13;
&#13;
because next year we want to be able to do the 12 projects we&#13;
&#13;
have scheduled, probably optimistically, nevertheless, so we&#13;
&#13;
don't want to cut.    So this year we'll put 12 too, and of&#13;
&#13;
course we misinform the bean counters." Then the bean&#13;
&#13;
counters have their own revenge at the end of the year and&#13;
&#13;
say, "Well, goddamn it, you didn't deliver 12, you only&#13;
&#13;
delivered eight, and we are going to cut your budget by X."&#13;
&#13;
So these things are not going to go away.     I think they are&#13;
&#13;
management issues internal to the Bank that will always be&#13;
&#13;
there.     They are natural contradictions that have to be&#13;
&#13;
managed.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I must be one of the few people in the world that you'll&#13;
&#13;
meet outside the Bank who is fascinated by extension&#13;
&#13;
services.&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.     You know, in fact, it's such a passionate business&#13;
&#13;
that we have practically riots over extension services. The&#13;
&#13;
French are giving me a terrible time over these extension&#13;
&amp;#12;                          WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95   Page 58&#13;
&#13;
services.   You know, I sent a mission to France to see their&#13;
&#13;
Extension Service and it turns out it's exactly like the one&#13;
&#13;
we are advocating. But it's not the one that they are&#13;
&#13;
advocating in Africa.   And the difference is a very colonial&#13;
&#13;
attitude.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   It's also a great French attitude.&#13;
&#13;
A:   They do not act vis-a-vis their Brittany farmers the way&#13;
&#13;
they would have us act vis-a-vis the African and the way they&#13;
&#13;
act vis-a-vis the African.    They don't trust these Africans.&#13;
&#13;
 That's basically it. But anyway, the (Bretons) don't trust&#13;
&#13;
Paris. So things even out.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You were describing how it took you about three or four&#13;
&#13;
years to consolidate all of these extension services, and I&#13;
&#13;
was trying to imagine the politics of that. I was imagining,&#13;
&#13;
the reaction of the donor countries. You just described a big&#13;
&#13;
problem.    Every American has a problem with the French.   We&#13;
&#13;
always have.   And the French have problems with us. They beat&#13;
&#13;
up on Eisenhower all the time.&#13;
&#13;
     You've got these, you've got not only the donor&#13;
&#13;
countries, and France being an example, but you've got the&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95      Page 59&#13;
&#13;
local political system as well. All these people who are&#13;
&#13;
involved in the extension service, many of whom are&#13;
&#13;
passionate and have a lot of pride in what they do.      I'm&#13;
&#13;
trying to imagine how you brought about the consolidation.&#13;
&#13;
I'm trying to imagine the politics of that.&#13;
&#13;
A:   The first thing is that the last assumption is wrong.&#13;
&#13;
The agricultural extension workers in Africa are demoralized.&#13;
&#13;
They don't have any budget, they don't have any results.&#13;
&#13;
They are not esteemed by the farmers, and they hide all day&#13;
&#13;
in the market place rather than going out and expose their&#13;
&#13;
ignorance to old farmers who know how to grow corn. These&#13;
&#13;
guys don't know how to grow corn.     They don't know anything,&#13;
&#13;
and they've not been given any training.     They are not&#13;
&#13;
informed.   They do not have a message to give to these&#13;
&#13;
farmers.    So they skulk around and they are not exactly&#13;
&#13;
ashamed to take their pay, but they are not getting paid and&#13;
&#13;
they are not getting any perks or anything to go with it. The&#13;
&#13;
whole system is defunct.&#13;
&#13;
     Now, in some of these little pockets, they have trained&#13;
&#13;
extension workers, but these extension workers, in some cases&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95     Page 60&#13;
&#13;
are white. This is a sinecure.     There are all kinds of guys&#13;
&#13;
in "lederhosen" walking around out there telling people how&#13;
&#13;
to grow corn.     These African farmers are polite but these&#13;
&#13;
guys are overqualified, overpaid, and they are not getting&#13;
&#13;
results either.     They can't see enough farmers to ever bulk&#13;
&#13;
anything up into anything but the most luxurious showcase&#13;
&#13;
operations.     And these operations are irrelevant.&#13;
&#13;
        We appeal to the government.   First of all, we say, "You&#13;
&#13;
need an extension service that's going to serve your needs.&#13;
&#13;
You've probably got twice as many people as you need.        So one&#13;
&#13;
of the first things to do is cut the service down to a chosen&#13;
&#13;
few. Then you adopt this system in which you train them every&#13;
&#13;
two weeks and they go visit the farmers every two weeks, so&#13;
&#13;
they have their own clientele and they have something to&#13;
&#13;
say."     And then we back them up with a research system. This&#13;
&#13;
is all really part of the deal. The research is the back end&#13;
&#13;
of it. And that's the failing end at the moment.       But the&#13;
&#13;
middle part is what we call the "subject matter specialists,"&#13;
&#13;
and they deal with livestock, field crops, perennial crops,&#13;
&#13;
tree crops or whatever.     But they don't have a separate&#13;
&amp;#12;'â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95        Page 61&#13;
&#13;
     extension system for each of these things.      The farmer sees&#13;
&#13;
     the same guy, whether he's growing maize or cocoa, but this&#13;
&#13;
     fellow is trained by these subject men who serve as a&#13;
&#13;
     constant reference.   Not only that.     Everybody knows where&#13;
&#13;
     this Extension worker is every moment of his working day.&#13;
&#13;
     He's got an appointment, he's under a tree, he's in the&#13;
&#13;
     schoolyard or in a public square in these villages, and he's&#13;
&#13;
     got to be there at ten o'clock. He's got a bicycle or a&#13;
&#13;
     motorcycle and he's going to be there.     And the supervisor&#13;
&#13;
     can find him there, and does.   I mean, these guys are&#13;
&#13;
     supervised. So this system seems to work, and there's not a&#13;
&#13;
     white face in the entire service, not one.     We are now&#13;
&#13;
     working in 22 countries and there is not one expatriate.&#13;
&#13;
     World Bank staff is organized in the field,     they visit these&#13;
&#13;
     projects, they do a lot of supervision:      It's very expensive&#13;
&#13;
     for us.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:   How did you get all the white faces out of there?&#13;
&#13;
     A:   Well, that's a real problem.      Africa is completely&#13;
&#13;
     peopled with what you call "middle level" functionaries and&#13;
&#13;
     professionals who really are out of touch with reality&#13;
&amp;#12;                             WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95     Page 62&#13;
&#13;
anywhere else in the world.       They are no longer considered&#13;
&#13;
employable.     They are doing just fine and loving Africa.      But&#13;
&#13;
they are overpaid and they don't have much impact.         They are&#13;
&#13;
hanging on tenaciously.      They are not going to be put out of&#13;
&#13;
business.     And they are bad-mouthing any attempt at reform.&#13;
&#13;
        The French believe that this extension system is such a&#13;
&#13;
powerful organizational technique. You have 4,000 or 5,000&#13;
&#13;
people, you know where they are every day and they are&#13;
&#13;
talking to 60 other people every day. So you get this&#13;
&#13;
incredible machine, you could put anything in it, propaganda,&#13;
&#13;
political organization. The French are worried about the&#13;
&#13;
power this entails, that governments are going to have this&#13;
&#13;
highly effective tool. It's like giving them an AK-47. They&#13;
&#13;
can do anything with it.      But I'm not going to worry about&#13;
&#13;
that.     We are delivering agricultural technology and that is&#13;
&#13;
essential.     But now we are also thinking about using the&#13;
&#13;
system to maintain roads, we are thinking about using it in&#13;
&#13;
the school systems, we are thinking about using it in family&#13;
&#13;
planning.     And why not?   Why can't we use, not the same&#13;
&#13;
people, but the same technique for this?&#13;
&amp;#12;                          WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95    Page 63&#13;
&#13;
     It has the great advantage that it is not very capital-&#13;
&#13;
intensive. The loans that the World Bank makes for it are&#13;
&#13;
small, so it looks like we are transferring less money. There&#13;
&#13;
are a lot of recurrent expenditures which we are regarding as&#13;
&#13;
capital in the sense that we are creating capital. Technology&#13;
&#13;
in the hands of farmers is capital in the production process.&#13;
&#13;
 So we are getting rid of the religiosity of capital versus&#13;
&#13;
recurrent expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
     We are willing to finance recurrent expenditures.        We&#13;
&#13;
think other donors should as well.     In a few other areas,&#13;
&#13;
like schools and research centers, we deal with the issue the&#13;
&#13;
same way.   But the point is that our internal costs have&#13;
&#13;
risen amazingly. Instead of this one million dollars per&#13;
&#13;
project, it's probably going up to a million and a half&#13;
&#13;
total. But we are spending only about a third of it by the&#13;
&#13;
time we get to approval, and we are spending two-thirds in&#13;
&#13;
the field in the course of usually four years.     This means&#13;
&#13;
the administrative budget is going up, and the capital&#13;
&#13;
transfer is going down in the sector. So it's looking like a&#13;
&#13;
very cost-ineffective operation.     So there's resistance.&#13;
&amp;#12;                          WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95   Page 64&#13;
&#13;
Q:   It's politically vulnerable.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yeah.   But it's the wrong impression.   The impression is&#13;
&#13;
wrong because we are dealing with a highly catalytic&#13;
&#13;
approach. 95 percent of the effort is on the farm with the&#13;
&#13;
farmer, his land, his labor, his inputs.&#13;
&#13;
     The other element here is the environment.   Without this&#13;
&#13;
technology the environment is on the way to the garage. Be-&#13;
&#13;
cause these farmers are growing in numbers at this phenomenal&#13;
&#13;
rate and they are using a land-extensive technology, and&#13;
&#13;
shifting agriculture cultivation.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Just like we did when we probably settled America.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Exactly. They've gone into the forest, they are going&#13;
&#13;
into the pasture lands with crops, they are changing the&#13;
&#13;
ecology, they are going to ruin it.   The cost of this 25&#13;
&#13;
years from now will be irredeemable if we don't turn it&#13;
&#13;
around in the meantime.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Still on the same subject, when did you begin to feel&#13;
&#13;
that the new extension techniques were taking hold? How long&#13;
&#13;
did that take?&#13;
&amp;#12;                          WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95      Page 65&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, Danny Benor was doing this in Asia long before he&#13;
&#13;
came to Africa.    Africa was, is only his latest and greatest&#13;
&#13;
success.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Most difficult.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, he says it's not.    You know, he was amazed.     The&#13;
&#13;
quality of farming in Africa is actually potentially very&#13;
&#13;
high. He's always saying, "Look, you show me an African&#13;
&#13;
farmer and I'll show you some of the best, most clever people&#13;
&#13;
in the world."    These people may be conservative, too&#13;
&#13;
conservative. The way we've tackled that is by saying, "Look,&#13;
&#13;
just devote 10 square meters to our crop, to our technique.&#13;
&#13;
You know, take a risk.    If you don't like it, forget it.      But&#13;
&#13;
if you like it, then, you extend it.    Right?"   That's the&#13;
&#13;
agreement.    And, you know it makes such a phenomenal&#13;
&#13;
difference.    Planting in rows, proper spacing, so there's&#13;
&#13;
less weeding and more product. Applying the fertilizer in two&#13;
&#13;
applications rather than one and doing it in the right&#13;
&#13;
amounts at the right time.     It makes all the difference in&#13;
&#13;
the world.    And it costs less, in the end.   The thing is just&#13;
&#13;
going like wild fire with a demonstrated doubling and&#13;
&amp;#12;                         WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95     Page 66&#13;
&#13;
tripling of yields. Even in Burkina Faso, which is a very&#13;
&#13;
austere place. Most of the technique was transferred from&#13;
&#13;
Maharashtra and Thailand and Indonesia, by Danny Benor who is&#13;
&#13;
from the extension service of Israel. He is the guy who&#13;
&#13;
devised this system in Israel and is now taking it to Africa.&#13;
&#13;
 As I said, we are in 22 or 23 countries, and we've gone to&#13;
&#13;
scale in five or six now with the whole country covered.&#13;
&#13;
Virtually, every farmer in the country is being seen by.&#13;
&#13;
extension workers on a bi-weekly basis with a specific&#13;
&#13;
message.   They don't go out at the beginning of the year and&#13;
&#13;
say, "Look, this is how you grow corn, maize."   They go out&#13;
&#13;
and they say, "I see you've got maize in your field.     Now&#13;
&#13;
let's see if maybe we could, take 10 meters here and plant&#13;
&#13;
them closer together" and use some devices, give them a&#13;
&#13;
little stick, a little measuring device to work with.&#13;
&#13;
     This is how far apart to plant.   This is how far apart&#13;
&#13;
to put the rows. Or a little&#13;
&#13;
     [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE 2]&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95     Page 67&#13;
&#13;
--dixie cup, which contains the exact amount of seed for one&#13;
&#13;
row of maize, or fertilizer.     And then the guy gets this&#13;
&#13;
phenomenal result.&#13;
&#13;
     Danny is really a genius.     He is a messianic type, and&#13;
&#13;
he wears this little horned beanie on his head so you can see&#13;
&#13;
him for miles.   In Africa you can see this guy literally a&#13;
&#13;
mile away walking through the fields.    He spends a couple of&#13;
&#13;
hundred days a year in African farmers fields.     He is known&#13;
&#13;
all over Africa as Danny Benor."    He'll sit with these&#13;
&#13;
farmers, like in Burkina I was with him, we went and looked&#13;
&#13;
at this erosive edge of the desert moving 200 meters a year&#13;
&#13;
in our direction.    And it had been doing that for years.&#13;
&#13;
Trees half-buried, just within sight.    And he said, "Well,&#13;
&#13;
what are we going to do about this?"    He may look at a farm,&#13;
&#13;
a farmer's field and say, "You must have had too much water&#13;
&#13;
here."   And the farmer says, "No, I have no water."     Benor&#13;
&#13;
would say, "Well, it looks like you wanted to grow very fast.&#13;
&#13;
 You know, you put the rows up and down the little hills&#13;
&#13;
here."   And Danny just says, "Well, why don't you go across&#13;
&#13;
instead of up and down?"    And they would talk about this for&#13;
&amp;#12;                             WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95   Page 68&#13;
&#13;
a day and a half.     And eventually it becomes this guy's idea&#13;
&#13;
to change the way he does business.       There are the extension&#13;
&#13;
workers, and they get these little rocks and they put them in&#13;
&#13;
line, just to slow the water down, about every 15 meters they&#13;
&#13;
put in a little line of rocks, run them across the contours.&#13;
&#13;
     There is only about three weeks of rain in the entire&#13;
&#13;
year. What happens is that the water slows down, sinks in,&#13;
&#13;
the wells fill up. They use mulch on their fields, the next&#13;
&#13;
thing the whole country is transformed and they've stopped&#13;
&#13;
the desert in Burkina Faso, right across the whole place.&#13;
&#13;
Hundreds of thousands of farmers have now adopted this&#13;
&#13;
technique.     And if you go there you'll see a mark, right&#13;
&#13;
across, you can see it from the air, right across the&#13;
&#13;
country, about 700 miles.      The desert has been definitely&#13;
&#13;
stopped.     And that has all been done in four years.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   That's in the most recent four years?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yeah.     Since 1990.   And I'm very bullish. Agriculture is&#13;
&#13;
growing at seven percent in West African Sahel. That's partly&#13;
&#13;
because of this onchocerciasis.      We've got rid of this river&#13;
&#13;
blindness which allowed people moving in there and culti-&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95    Page 69&#13;
&#13;
vating the land. Now we've got a potential ecological&#13;
&#13;
disaster and the extension service has got to be there right&#13;
&#13;
away in order to make sure that they don't use the old&#13;
&#13;
extensive technology.     They've got to stay on their plot.&#13;
&#13;
They've got to maintain the fertility of that plot.      And they&#13;
&#13;
can all do that if they farm it with some technology.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   When would you date the breakthrough on river blindness?&#13;
&#13;
 That's been fairly recent?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yeah.     They declared that the back was broken I think&#13;
&#13;
about 18 months ago.     And before that of course they knew&#13;
&#13;
they were on a winning wicket.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   The big thing is Neptazane, isn't it? Developed by&#13;
&#13;
Merck.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Merck was donating it to ITP.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   There's a funny story about that. When the CEO of Merck&#13;
&#13;
started to read this literature that implied that WHO&#13;
&#13;
developed the drug, he insisted that they had to say who&#13;
&#13;
developed this. One of those funny anecdotes.&#13;
&#13;
A:   In our literature Merck is given credit for that&#13;
&#13;
development.      And that was a big deal.   But more important&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95     Page 70&#13;
&#13;
than the drug which creates immunity or a cure was to deal&#13;
&#13;
with the flies. That was the costly part of it, of course I&#13;
&#13;
guess if Merck had charged us for this drug it would have&#13;
&#13;
been very expensive, but the way it was the expensive part of&#13;
&#13;
the program, getting rid of the flies that transmit the&#13;
&#13;
disease.     The first stage was getting rid of the fly.&#13;
&#13;
        Now, you've been going around giving speeches, telling&#13;
&#13;
people about how much progress has been made, that there is&#13;
&#13;
in fact progress in Africa and that it is not a lost cause.&#13;
&#13;
At the same time you have the feeling that those people who&#13;
&#13;
are saying, Africa is a basket case, are on the up and&#13;
&#13;
coming, and seem to be even using this to blame the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
They say the world Bank has failed.     Here is the example.&#13;
&#13;
This is how it has failed.     Africa isn't moving.   How do you&#13;
&#13;
explain this?     Why are people saying this?   How do we reach&#13;
&#13;
the point where even IDA is to some extent threatened by&#13;
&#13;
this?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Well, I don't agree with the last point.   I think the&#13;
&#13;
only thing going for IDA is Africa.     Without Africa IDA is&#13;
&amp;#12;                         WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95    Page 71&#13;
&#13;
dead. Very few countries could carry the IDA story the way&#13;
&#13;
Africa must and will, whatever the ideas.&#13;
&#13;
     But I think your point is right.   First of all I think&#13;
&#13;
that what has happened in Africa, while it has its positive&#13;
&#13;
turn to it and it's undeniable, the fact of the matter is&#13;
&#13;
that nobody is satisfied.   I certainly am not satisfied.     I&#13;
&#13;
don't think anybody in the region or in the Bank is satisfied&#13;
&#13;
with how long it's taken, how many slippages there have been,&#13;
&#13;
how much money it's required up to now, and how much money it&#13;
&#13;
will require if we can't speed up the effects.    The slow&#13;
&#13;
response of the private sector, which I think we understand,&#13;
&#13;
that's also part of the syndrome, and without the private&#13;
&#13;
sector we are not going to get an acceleration of the&#13;
&#13;
results.   So private response has got to come.   Since aid is&#13;
&#13;
not very buoyant, since debt is very important, since the&#13;
&#13;
economies are not diversified enough to withstand the kind of&#13;
&#13;
shocks they are undoubtedly going to meet, we need a&#13;
&#13;
diversified private sector, a more diversified economy.      If&#13;
&#13;
we don't get it we are going to remain at this very fragile&#13;
&#13;
and unsatisfactory level of performance.&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95    Page 72&#13;
&#13;
     But I think if I were talking to people who would in&#13;
&#13;
fact make the argument that way, we would have no big&#13;
&#13;
disagreement.    And there would also not be much criticism of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank because it would be seen as a very tough job, one&#13;
&#13;
that's going to require a long-term perspective, a lot of&#13;
&#13;
effort, some luck, and a lot of other things.&#13;
&#13;
     But, unfortunately, what we do have is people who come&#13;
&#13;
for a very quick take and they look at the averages on&#13;
&#13;
Africa. This includes Zaire, Sudan, Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi,&#13;
&#13;
Liberia, Sierra Leone, Angola, Nigeria, countries that have&#13;
&#13;
not been going in the right   direc~ion   or are still in a&#13;
&#13;
freefall or in chaos.   The negative rates of growth of these&#13;
&#13;
countries are offsetting, in the averages, the positive&#13;
&#13;
growths in the other countries which are more numerous but&#13;
&#13;
smaller. And, of course, these negative rates are much higher&#13;
&#13;
than the positive rates.&#13;
&#13;
     In the whole Franc zone before the devaluation we were&#13;
&#13;
getting a negative growth of four percent per annum growth.&#13;
&#13;
That had a hell of an impact on Africa.     Now all that's&#13;
&#13;
turned around.   It's back to one or two percent positive.&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95     Page 73&#13;
&#13;
This year it will be around five or six percent on average I&#13;
&#13;
think in the Franc zone.     Certainly in Cote d'Ivoire it will&#13;
&#13;
be around six percent.     Senegal, probably.    So, you see,&#13;
&#13;
these averages distort the picture.&#13;
&#13;
      If you look at Africa as one place you get this result.&#13;
&#13;
 Unfortunately, most of the world does not look at Africa in&#13;
&#13;
its diversity, it doesn't break it down, it doesn't unbundle&#13;
&#13;
it.   It doesn't look at what's happening in Senegal, Benin,&#13;
&#13;
or Togo, or Ouagadougou; Burkina Faso, or in South Africa or&#13;
&#13;
in Malawi.   If you looked at Asia like that in the late&#13;
&#13;
Seventies you'd see the same phenomenon.&#13;
&#13;
      If you took the averages of, say, in '78, China, Burma&#13;
&#13;
Laos, and Vietnam and threw them in together with the Phili-&#13;
&#13;
ppines, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Korea, you would have&#13;
&#13;
a stagnant performance. In fact you would have probably a&#13;
&#13;
negative growth rate for the whole place.       We would not see&#13;
&#13;
the "Tigers," this phenomenon that has happened since then,&#13;
&#13;
although it was beginning to happen then.       We wouldn't be&#13;
&#13;
able to see them if we didn't have a more discriminating view&#13;
&#13;
of that part of the world than we do of Africa.       But we&#13;
&amp;#12;                           WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95      Page 74&#13;
&#13;
didn't lump those countries together, we didn't look at East&#13;
&#13;
Asia the way we look at Africa as simply one place.&#13;
&#13;
     So I think that's part of the issue, and it's got to be&#13;
&#13;
overcome.    That's why we've written another Long-Term&#13;
&#13;
Perspective for Africa.     It's called "The Continent in&#13;
&#13;
Transition."     It disaggregates Africa and talks about the&#13;
&#13;
fact that quite a lot of the spectrum has opened up. Some of&#13;
&#13;
the countries that tightened up during the negative trends of&#13;
&#13;
the world economy, now are beginning to move with the little&#13;
&#13;
sea breeze that's coming from the world economy. But the ones&#13;
&#13;
that are in chaos are still anchored there. They are still&#13;
&#13;
flapping in the wind.&#13;
&#13;
     You are a sailor.     You got the analogy.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Yeah.     The addition of South Africa to the whole game&#13;
&#13;
plan has presumably increased the prospect for changes. This&#13;
&#13;
may give Africa a lift.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Certainly Southern Africa.       It's already happened in&#13;
&#13;
some respects.     But South Africa is not a strong economy.&#13;
&#13;
It's a very sick economy.       It's not competitive.   It's not&#13;
&#13;
modern.     It can't compete.    It has been cut off from the rest&#13;
&amp;#12;                          WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95       Page 75&#13;
&#13;
of the world, and it's had a negative growth rate for 10&#13;
&#13;
years.     It still got various political problems. But I think&#13;
&#13;
the political energy unleashed by the success of southern&#13;
&#13;
South Africa is going to have effects on its neighbors.        In&#13;
&#13;
DEC they now talk about neighborhood effects.     This is&#13;
&#13;
definitely a positive neighborhood effect. It could become&#13;
&#13;
very positive when the South African economy really starts to&#13;
&#13;
move again. The negative effects, though, of the neighborhood&#13;
&#13;
effects of Nigeria are equally strong, if anything&#13;
&#13;
outweighing the positive effects of South Africa in Africa as&#13;
&#13;
a whole.    The negative effects of Nigeria probably more than&#13;
&#13;
offset the positive effects of the CFA devaluation in that&#13;
&#13;
part of the world. So we have a very serious economic&#13;
&#13;
objective in West Africa, to get Nigeria back on a positive&#13;
&#13;
growth path, and with their political problems that's going&#13;
&#13;
to take a lot of doing.    That's not going to be easy.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   That's another governance issue.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Exactly.&#13;
&amp;#12;                         WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95     Page 76&#13;
&#13;
Q:   When did the Ogeneral critique of the Bank come up on&#13;
&#13;
your scope?   When did you notice tha there were a lot of&#13;
&#13;
people that don't like us?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, we became much too important in Africa.     We are&#13;
&#13;
like the judge in the bankruptcy court.     You know, they can't&#13;
&#13;
even pay their debts without our permission.     I think I've&#13;
&#13;
said this before.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
A:   And the other donors are sort of in the back seat of us&#13;
&#13;
because we are leading this economic reform.     The African&#13;
&#13;
countries can't come up with the shillings to finish the&#13;
&#13;
projects that are financed by the Danes or the Swedes because&#13;
&#13;
the IMF and the World Bank have said "You cannot inflate, you&#13;
&#13;
can't create any more money. The NGOs think that change is&#13;
&#13;
painful for the poor, even though without change, the poor&#13;
&#13;
would be the first to get it in the neck.     So I think that&#13;
&#13;
we've earned all this because we have become too important.&#13;
&#13;
I don't think we've made a lot of mistakes.    Of course, we've&#13;
&#13;
made mistakes. I'm willing to admit that.&#13;
&amp;#12;I.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95    Page 77&#13;
&#13;
     Q:   Sure.   Could the Bank have done anything to prevent&#13;
&#13;
     that, in your view?&#13;
&#13;
     A:   Belatedly we are doing some of the things we should have&#13;
&#13;
     done earlier. One is to reach out to the NGOs. I believe the&#13;
&#13;
     NGOs and the World Bank are natural allies.    They should be,&#13;
&#13;
     because we have similar objectives.   In the case of Africa,&#13;
&#13;
     though, the African governments were negative about NGOs by&#13;
&#13;
     and large.   NGOs were considered to be not just non-govern-&#13;
&#13;
     mental but anti-governmental, and as a result we couldn't&#13;
&#13;
     really operate with them because these governments own us for&#13;
&#13;
     better or for worse, and you just cannot operate with loan&#13;
&#13;
     money in a country without the permission of the borrower.&#13;
&#13;
          So the idea of cooperating with NGOs, both domestic and&#13;
&#13;
     foreign or international, in Africa really is only becoming a&#13;
&#13;
     possibility now, because the governments are recognizing a&#13;
&#13;
     role for the civil society as they accept political&#13;
&#13;
     pluralism.   And it's coming pretty rapidly.   So I think&#13;
&#13;
     there's a whole new world there for us, and we should move in&#13;
&#13;
     that direction.   The trouble is that the NGOs, in their anti-&#13;
&#13;
     government mode, have put the World Bank back there with the&#13;
&amp;#12;                             WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95     Page 78&#13;
&#13;
enemy, the government because we were with the government. We&#13;
&#13;
have to do something about this general situation.         The NGOs&#13;
&#13;
are becoming more welcomed.       But now there's a lot of tension&#13;
&#13;
between the northern NGOs and the domestic NGOs.       We are&#13;
&#13;
going to have to walk that mine field and learn how to do&#13;
&#13;
this.     We are doing it.   We are now doing a hell of a lot&#13;
&#13;
more with NGOs than the Bank used to.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      You are not too late in doing that.&#13;
&#13;
A:      But Africa is really the acid test for more&#13;
&#13;
participation in my opinion.      And I think that what I'm&#13;
&#13;
saying now is not so untrue of the rest of the world.        When&#13;
&#13;
did Latin America become a place where NGOs flourished in&#13;
&#13;
cooperation with government?       It wasn't until quite recently.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Right.&#13;
&#13;
A:      This may or may not be true in South Asia, but in East&#13;
&#13;
Asia governments are very chary about these northern NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
In Indonesia I don't think they practically exist.         They are&#13;
&#13;
not allowed in there at all.       Then, of course, there are the&#13;
&#13;
single-issue NGOs which we treated in an arrogant fashion,&#13;
&#13;
and they treat us in an arrogant fashion.       Wolfensohn I think&#13;
&amp;#12;.,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95    Page 79&#13;
&#13;
     has started a good dialogue with them.     Hopefully he will&#13;
&#13;
     follow through.&#13;
&#13;
          The fact that the African public is so ignorant about&#13;
&#13;
     the Bank is also something that can only now be dealt with&#13;
&#13;
     because the newspapers, the press is becoming open.      We can&#13;
&#13;
     now communicate directly with the African public, rather than&#13;
&#13;
     just through BBC and Voice of America and those other&#13;
&#13;
     vehicles.     In the old days you practically lost your job if&#13;
&#13;
     you were quoted in the press, managers and staff alike. It&#13;
&#13;
     was not expected that we would discuss our business with the&#13;
&#13;
     hoi polloi.    In fact, McNamara had the attitude that any&#13;
&#13;
     nickel spent on public relations was a nickel that was taken&#13;
&#13;
     away from the caloric intake of some starving child. That&#13;
&#13;
     attitude still persists and anybody who speaks up is either&#13;
&#13;
     on.some incredible ego trip or is otherwise jeopardizing the&#13;
&#13;
     sanctity of the relationship and all the coziness that goes&#13;
&#13;
     with this government-to-Bank relationship, which is exactly&#13;
&#13;
     what the NGOs and the public are screaming about.&#13;
&amp;#12;                         WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95    Page 80&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Business got over that.   There was once a time when&#13;
&#13;
Vanderbilt said "The public be damned," but they don't say&#13;
&#13;
that anymore.&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.   I don't think we ever said that.   I think we've&#13;
&#13;
thought it.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Do you want to look back or sum up with something here.&#13;
&#13;
 Do you want to say something about what you personally feel&#13;
&#13;
were the accomplishments that you've logged in your career&#13;
&#13;
and, and any disappointments you may have had.&#13;
&#13;
A:   I have no disappointments about the content of the job.&#13;
&#13;
 With my interest in the job, the kind of passion that I&#13;
&#13;
have, this is juice for me, this is the real stuff.    I wish&#13;
&#13;
that the Bank had been and could be more effective.    I think&#13;
&#13;
that the problems of dealing with some of the issues we are&#13;
&#13;
now dealing with from so far away can be solved. We need to&#13;
&#13;
change the way we are governed by heavy bureaucracy and&#13;
&#13;
internal checks and balances. It's probably necessary to some&#13;
&#13;
extent but it does in fact curb our agility, our&#13;
&#13;
effectiveness and our timeliness, and a lot of other things&#13;
&#13;
that are important to our customers.   So I really think that&#13;
&amp;#12;â&#128;¢&#13;
.â&#128;¢&#13;
Â·-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95     Page 81&#13;
&#13;
     those are areas for the future to be addressed. We are&#13;
&#13;
     certainly doing it here in Africa, and I hope to be involved&#13;
&#13;
     in that.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:      Okay.   I really enjoyed this.&#13;
&#13;
     A:      Well, I enjoyed it too.     Thank you very much, you guys--&#13;
&#13;
     Q:      I've learned a lot about the extension service.&#13;
&#13;
     A:      You should be interviewing Danny Benor sometime. I think&#13;
&#13;
     he's one of the great men.        At one point we were thinking&#13;
&#13;
     about having a prize.     We thought in the context of the 50th&#13;
&#13;
     Anniversary. A prize to, even if posthumous, to Bernie Bell&#13;
&#13;
     or to McNamara and Danny Benor, I guess John Crawford already&#13;
&#13;
     got his rewards in many ways.        But, we would, pick some of&#13;
&#13;
     these really outstanding people, people who had made a&#13;
&#13;
     contribution to some of the important issues in the world.&#13;
&#13;
     They used the Bank as the bully pulpit or as a platform or a&#13;
&#13;
     launch pad or whatever you want to call it, to magnify their&#13;
&#13;
     influence.      I think it's one of the greatest uses of the&#13;
&#13;
     Bank, I have not exhausted the number of people involved&#13;
&#13;
     here.     I think that the question would be to really identify&#13;
&#13;
     them.&#13;
&amp;#12;                        WORLD BANK - JAYCOX 5/24/95      Page 82&#13;
&#13;
Q:   It depends on how much money you have.&#13;
&#13;
A:   We could do it about every five years or so.     I mean,&#13;
&#13;
why not?   If we are going to have a 50th year, we are going&#13;
&#13;
to have a 55th, we are going to have a 60th, we are going to&#13;
&#13;
have a 65th, we are going to have a 75th.&#13;
&#13;
     So, every five years or Â·so, pick, two or three people,&#13;
&#13;
go back 20 years or so in order to really see that their&#13;
&#13;
contribution has stood the test of time. It's just a thought.&#13;

            Transcript of oral history interview with

            On February 23, March 9, April 27 and
            May 24, 1995, Edward V. K. Jaycox was interviewed on behalf
            of the World Bank Group Archives oral history program by
            Jochen Kraske and Lou Galambos. During his tenure at the
            Bank from 1964 to 1996, Mr. Jaycox worked in the following
            areas: as director in the transportation projects department
            (1972-1973), the transportation and urban projects
            department (1973-1976), the water and urban development
            department (1977-1979), and the East Asia and Pacific (EAP)
            country programs department (1979-1984); and as vice
            president in both the eastern Africa region (1984-1987) and
            the Africa region (1987-1996). He discusses the
            reorganization of the World Bank under Robert McNamara and
            how the new objectives weakened or compromised functions of
            the World Bank because employees did not get the cultural
            changes for which they were aiming. His transcript also
            concerns projects in Africa, the board of directors, and accountability.
