STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
KYRGYZ REPUBLIC&#13;
RURAL FINANCE PROJECT&#13;
I.   THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR&#13;
A.    THE FARMING SECTOR&#13;
1.01   Agriculture is important in the Kyrgyz economy as it accounts for about 30 percent of GDP and&#13;
approximately one-third of employment. An additional 10 percent of the labor force is employed in&#13;
agriculture-related industries, mostly agribusiness enterprises. Agribusiness activities add to the overall&#13;
impact of agriculture to account for over 50 percent of GDP.&#13;
1.02   Irrigation is critical for agriculture, covering over 80 percent of arable land. The main crops&#13;
grown are wheat, barley, maize, cotton, tobacco, sugar beet, sunflower, potatoes, vegetables, fruits, and&#13;
fodder crops. Winter wheat is the dominant cereal crop, accounting for over 40 percent of the area&#13;
usually under grains. Livestock production contributes significantly to total agricultural production. The&#13;
major livestock products are meat, milk, wool and eggs.&#13;
1.03   Agricultural output in the last two years has shown significant recovery. Indeed, recovery in&#13;
agricultural output in 1996 exceeded expectations. Agricultural output increased by 13 percent in real&#13;
terms, compared to the overall GDP growth of 5 percent in 1996. The major sources of agricultural&#13;
growth were wheat, potato, cotton, and vegetables. This recovery in agricultural growth was largely due&#13;
to expansion in cultivated area, changes in cropping patterns (shift from fodder to grain production), and&#13;
favorable weather conditions. Also recent farm studies indicate that profitability in some of these crops&#13;
and dairy farming has improved and the prospects for further improvements appear good in the coming&#13;
years as markets become more competitive. Crop profitability is improving much faster in small private&#13;
farms than on large public sector farms. Most public sector farms continue to operate with losses. Also,&#13;
most livestock production remains generally less profitable than crop production, largely because prices&#13;
for most livestock products have remained depressed.&#13;
1.04   Despite the implementation of the ongoing economic reforms and the recent recovery in output,&#13;
farm productivity and profitability continue to face major constraints. The constraints include limited&#13;
supply of critical inputs, lack of competitive markets, lack of appropriate technical packages and&#13;
advisory services for private farmers, lack of credit for private farmers, and existence of inefficient farm&#13;
structures. The last constraint is particularly important because it is a precondition for improved farm&#13;
productivity and profitability. Farm  restructuring is still an unfinished agenda.  To date, farm&#13;
restructuring has taken a variety of forms which include the emergence of: (a) private individual peasant&#13;
farms (23,000); (b) family farming associations (1,500); collective farms (540); state farms (320); and&#13;
joint-stock farm enterprises (15). By the end of 1996, it was estimated that private sector farms&#13;
accounted for over 60 percent of the land held by agricultural enterprises. The remainder was still in the&#13;
hands of public sector farms.&#13;
1.05   To sustain and accelerate the apparent recovery in agriculture, Government needs to address at&#13;
least the following four issues: (a) farm restructuring, which has slowed down, should be accelerated to&#13;
promote the emergence of efficient farms; (b) price and market distortions should be eliminated&#13;
(especially at the local level and any inter-oblast trade restrictions); (c) access to credit by private farm&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
and agribusiness enterprises should be ensured to promote farm investments and the development of&#13;
competitive farm markets; and (d) provision of technical advisory services and new productivity-&#13;
enhancing technologies should be given high priority.&#13;
1.06   Despite the recent recovery in agricultural growth, poverty has increased significantly over the&#13;
last three years. The proportion of households considered poor increased from 40 percent in 1993 to 49&#13;
percent in 1996. The poverty gap index, which measures the difference between the poverty line and the&#13;
household's actual expenditure levels, doubled from 12 percent in 1993 to 24 percent in 1996. The&#13;
proportion of the very poor households, those which spend less than half of their poverty line&#13;
expenditures, virtually remained the same at 25 percent over the period. Poverty alleviation will require&#13;
specific measures which target the poor as primary beneficiaries. The proposed project's Small Farmers'&#13;
Credit Outreach Program (SFCOP) would target households at, or slightly above the poverty line, while&#13;
Kyrgyz Agricultural Credit Corporation's (KAFC) lending program and Asian Development Bank's&#13;
(ADB) credit unions program would be exclusively targeted at households well above the poverty line.&#13;
The very poor households would be targeted by the proposed Kyrgyz People's Initiative Project which is&#13;
being prepared for financing by the Bank and other donors.&#13;
B.    AGRIBUSINESS SECTOR&#13;
1.07   Since independence in 1992, agro-processing has dramatically declined in the Kyrgyz Republic.&#13;
The sector remains in a serious crisis, despite government privatization effort which has resulted in the&#13;
emergence of numerous private agribusinesses. A survey (1996) of agribusiness enterprises conducted&#13;
during the preparation of this project, revealed that the expected surge in private agribusiness activities,&#13;
leading to the development of competitive markets, has not materialized out of the recent liberalization&#13;
and privatization programs of the Government. Emerging private enterprises are facing considerable&#13;
commercial risks and relatively high costs for goods and services (including finance) which weaken their&#13;
scope to participate and compete in markets. The weak financial markets have been deleterious to the&#13;
development of private agribusiness in the country. The poor state of the banking sector has inhibited&#13;
the capacity of private agribusiness enterprises to respond effectively to the production and market&#13;
opportunities being created by liberalization policies. Private small agribusiness enterprises have very&#13;
limited access to formal sources of credit and face high collateral requirements and limited term finance&#13;
options. Also equally limiting is the dearth of agribusiness management skills as a result of the past&#13;
dominance of processing and marketing state enterprises.&#13;
1.08   The agribusiness survey (1996) also revealed the following to be the most critical issues in the&#13;
agribusiness sector in the Kyrgyz Republic today:&#13;
(a)    Lack of working capital for raw materials. Agro-processing plants or enterprises do not&#13;
have cash to pay farmers for their produce during the harvest/marketing season. This&#13;
has led farmers to sell their produce to small traders for cash or bartered goods, leaving&#13;
most agro-processing plants without raw materials;&#13;
(b)    Lack of capital for renovation of equipment and machinery. Machinery and equipment&#13;
replacement or renovation is required in most of the agro-processing plants, especially in&#13;
food processing industries, to improve efficiency and product quality;&#13;
(c)    Lack of capital for financing inventory and receivables. The time required to hold a&#13;
finished product in storage prior to actual sale is relatively longer in the Kyrgyz market&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
where market information is not readily available to potential buyers. This requires&#13;
financing or else it forces the producing firm to sell on cash basis; and&#13;
(d)    Lack of working capital for farm  inputs supply. Major farm  inputs, like fertilizers,&#13;
seeds, and livestock drugs are generally not traded or retailed by local stockists or&#13;
dealers and distributors because of lack of working capital.&#13;
1.09   The proposed project would address  some of these issues by providing eligible private&#13;
agribusiness enterprises with access to short term loans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

II.    RURAL FINANCE SYSTEM&#13;
A.    THE FINANCIAL SECTOR&#13;
2.01   The financial sector in the Kyrgyz Republic suffers from the legacy of the Soviet past and the early&#13;
transitional efforts. The banking structure has until recently been dominated by four former state-owned&#13;
banks -- Agroprom, Promstroi, AKB Kyrgyzstan and Elbank -- that accounted for 80 percent of the banking&#13;
sector assets and were highly insolvent due to bad debt. Slowly growing segment of newer, market-oriented&#13;
banks are still quite fragile. The newly emerging capital markets are insufficient to meet the needs of a&#13;
market system which is developing rapidly in response to the successful enterprise privatization. At&#13;
present, the Kyrgyz banking system consists of NBK, the central bank, and 16 commercial banks. There are&#13;
also a number of non-bank financial institutions. These include 17 investment funds, 30 insurance&#13;
companies, a stock exchange (KSE), a Coupon (privatization) Trading Center (CTC), and one significant&#13;
state-owned and two smaller private pension funds.&#13;
2.02   After the break up of the Soviet Union, inflation in the Kyrgyz Republic accelerated rapidly and,&#13;
over a relatively short period, the real value of bank deposits was massively eroded by negative real interest&#13;
rates. Following the introduction of the national currency, the Som, in 1993, considerable success has been&#13;
achieved in macro-financial stability.  The traditional policy of directed credits to enterprises and&#13;
agriculture continued officially until early 1994. Most of this lending covered losses or was to maintain&#13;
employment and was not undertaken on the basis of commercial criteria and was largely funded by the&#13;
NBK. During 1994, deposit and credit interest rates were liberalized, directed credits were discontinued,&#13;
refinance credit auctions were temporarily suspended, and domestic bank financing of the budget deficit&#13;
was sharply curtailed. The tight monetary stance since 1994 succeeded in bringing inflation down from&#13;
over 1000 percent per year in 1992, to around 35 percent in 1996. Interest rates have followed a similar&#13;
path, with real interest rates declining from over 200 percent in 1994 to around 25 percent in 1996.&#13;
2.03   The successful implementation of the stabilization program has revealed the structural and financial&#13;
weaknesses of the state enterprises, and at the same time, uncovered the portfolio problems of the&#13;
commercial banks. The decisive tightening of monetary policy not only cut the commercial banks' access to&#13;
NBK resources but also uncovered the extent of bad loans in the sector. In 1995, the non-performing loans&#13;
represented almost the entire portfolio of Agroprom as well as Elbank, the former Sberbank. In AKB&#13;
Kyrgyzstan and Promstroi, non-performing loans accounted for more than half of their portfolios. The&#13;
survival of the big formerly state-owned banks has been possible only because of specially negotiated terms&#13;
for the NBK debt and because of exemption from prudential regulations. The intermediation role of the&#13;
financial system has been severely constrained by these non-performing loans.&#13;
2.04   There has also been a wide-spread lack of confidence in the financial system. Past experience has&#13;
been dominated by dramatic loss in the real value of deposits and by periodic instances of difficulties in&#13;
withdrawing deposits. The failure of Kyrgyz banks to mobilize deposits is clearly linked to the sector's&#13;
insolvency problems. A further factor inhibiting deposit mobilization has been the practice, until recently,&#13;
of seizing the deposits of those believed to be in arrears on tax payments. In sum, the existing financial&#13;
system has until recently been incapable of performing the fundamental role of mobilizing deposits and&#13;
transforming those into loans.&#13;
B.    THE FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM PROGRAM&#13;
2.05   Following successful stabilization and major reforms in the key real sectors, it became clear that, at&#13;
this stage of the country's economic transformation process, a more stable and efficient financial sector,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
with an effective banking system at its core, would be essential to help sustain macroeconomic stability,&#13;
stimulate savings mobilization, support output recovery and expansion, and enhance the development of the&#13;
private sector.&#13;
2.06   A comprehensive Financial Sector Reform Program, therefore, supported by a Financial Sector&#13;
Adjustment Credit (FfNSAC) from IDA (US$45 million) was launched in June, 1996. The Reform&#13;
Program supported by FINSAC focuses on: (i) the creation of a policy and regulatory environment&#13;
conducive to the sound growth of a competitive and efficient private banking system; (ii) the liquidation of&#13;
the two dominant and insolvent state-owned banks: Agroprombank and Elbank, which, through their&#13;
practices, stifle the growth of their young private competitors; (iii) the downsizing and financial&#13;
restructuring through private re-capitalization of two large and insolvent former state banks: Promstroi and&#13;
AKB Kyrgyzstan Banks; (iv) the establishment of a temporary Debt Resolution Agency (DEBRA) to help&#13;
collect, restructure, sell or write off the old non-performing loans, and thus accelerate enterprise&#13;
restructuring or liquidation in the process; and (v) the creation of a regulatory and supervisory framework,&#13;
and supporting policies and infrastructure, for the development and growth of emerging non-bank financial&#13;
institutions (NBFIs).&#13;
2.07   The successful implementation of this Reform Program, already underway, will lead to the creation&#13;
of an initially smaller, but more solvent and efficient private banking system, capable of providing a broader&#13;
range of financial services to both borrowers and savers. In the rural areas, Agroprom bank and the existing&#13;
system of poorly-managed directed credit programs will initially be superseded by a better managed,&#13;
temporary rural finance system, funded by budgetary resources and donor assistance, and over the longer&#13;
term, by a commercially viable thus sustainable, system of rural banking and cooperatives. In the enterprise&#13;
sector, private enterprises will be served by smaller private sector banks, better regulated by sound&#13;
prudential norms, and equipped with sound credit policies and trained staff. The establishment of equity&#13;
markets is already underway, and will over time lead to more active trading of the shares of private&#13;
enterprises, thus contributing to better enterprise governance. The development and enforcement of a sound&#13;
regulatory and supervisory framework will enhance the efficiency and security of financial institutions; help&#13;
restore public confidence in the financial system; and encourage the emergence and expansion of non-bank&#13;
financial institutions (NBFIs).&#13;
C.    THE RURAL FINANCE SYSTEM&#13;
2.08   Until 1994, rural financing was dominated by the state owned Agroprombank. The demise of&#13;
this institution has left the rural sector without an institutional lender. In response to this void,&#13;
Government has decided to establish a commercially oriented and operationally autonomous credit&#13;
agency, the Kyrgyz Agricultural Finance Corporation (KAFC), and to begin the long-term development&#13;
of a community-based ruralfinance system (para. 3.01).&#13;
2.09   In the wake of the Agroprombank's closing in 1994, Government has channeled "credit" to&#13;
farmers through the Regional Administration (oblast and rayon akiamiat), whereby loans have been&#13;
administered by regional and district authorities. Later in 1995, several Rural Credit Cooperatives&#13;
(RCCs) were established among farmers under the directive of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food&#13;
(MAF). These approaches have had dismal results, in terms of credit reaching the target groups and of&#13;
loan repayment. Most of the funds were channeled to state and collective farms which have close&#13;
relations with the local administration. Private farmers have had no access to this credit. The RCCs are&#13;
not viable as social and economic entities. They do not command member loyalty as they are regarded&#13;
as part of the local government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
2.10   In addition to the Government credit program, seven donor-sponsored rural credit schemes are&#13;
active. These include schemes sponsored by TACIS, US-Kyrgyz Joint Agricultural Commission,&#13;
CARITASlHELVETAS, GTZ, FINCA, Kyrgyz Agricultural Company, and  an IDA-sponsored pilot&#13;
Peoples Development Project. These schemes, except GTZ, have concentrated on short-term lending for&#13;
seasonal inputs. The total amount of lending under these schemes is estimated at less than US$1.5&#13;
million per season. These various schemes have adopted diverse mechanisms for lending, recovering&#13;
loans, and managing risks. Lending through groups (as opposed to group lending) is the preferred&#13;
mechanism among the schemes. All schemes are achieving commendable loan recoveries, ranging&#13;
between 70 and 100 percent. The scope and geographical coverage of each credit scheme is extremely&#13;
limited. The total amount of informal credit is unknown. It is, however, estimated that less than 12&#13;
percent of the private farmers are currently participating in the donor-sponsored credit schemes.&#13;
2.11   While reasonable progress is being made, under the donor-sponsored schemes, to establish&#13;
informal and formal credit organizations, no attention has been given to the promotion of savings&#13;
mobilization. Consequently, FINCA and the Asian Development Bank, have had to start from scratch in&#13;
their attempt to promote voluntary savings and credit groups in the form of "village banks" and credit&#13;
unions, respectively.&#13;
2.12   Some private farmers are using informal and semi-formal credit mechanisms for procuring farm&#13;
inputs and working capital. These include, trader-provided credit in form of inputs which are repaid with&#13;
pre-negotiated shares of the production of a farm product; farmer to farmer credit in cash or kind to&#13;
enable poorer farmers procure essential farm inputs; and government-provided credit in-kind (fertilizers,&#13;
seed, fuel) in exchange for delivery of wheat at harvest.&#13;
2.13   Superior credit repayment performance, under the various credit schemes, is associated with&#13;
individual borrowing within groups which have been voluntarily established to provide individual&#13;
members with access to institutional credit.  Such groups include village or regional farmers'&#13;
associations and credit groups. Credit repayment tends to improve when credit is offered and used as&#13;
part of a technical package being sponsored by a "partnership of stakeholders" (e.g., farmers, credit&#13;
agency, and farm extension service staff). Similarly, credit repayment performance tends to improve&#13;
when individual loan applications are screened and endorsed, and repayment is enforced by a self-&#13;
selected farmer group.  This approach appears to mitigate the problems of imperfect borrower&#13;
information and repayment enforcement. Groups established voluntarily are more cohesive (in the&#13;
sociological sense) and share a higher degree of mutual trust than those established under covert duress,&#13;
for example, the RCCs groups.&#13;
2.14   To succeed the credit schemes or local intermediaries initially must inculcate and enforce a&#13;
"credit -repayment-culture" among the borrowing group to dispel the legacy of rampant non-repayment&#13;
culture under the Agroprombank and the government credit programs. This process requires the&#13;
adoption of effective repayment mechanisms and training of members. Threats to cut off borrower's&#13;
future access to credit and peer pressure have proved to be effective sanctions to induce prompt and full&#13;
repayment.&#13;
2.15   Provision of credit-in-kind appears to be a popular and effective mechanism for credit risk&#13;
management among the schemes. Several credit schemes with superior recovery rates have adopted this&#13;
mechanism. Joint and several guarantees or group responsibility for each other's loan does not appear to&#13;
be popular or consistent with the Kyrgyz culture.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
2.16   Barter-based lending makes the lending interest rate structure less transparent.  Some&#13;
government commodity-based credit schemes have (implicit) high real interest rates which farmers have&#13;
been willingly paying. Nominal annual interest rates charged by various rural credit schemes ranged&#13;
between 12 and 39 percent during the 1995/96 crop season. It is noteworthy that some of these rates&#13;
were positive in real terms and yet they did not adversely affect credit recovery rates, given the&#13;
prevailing state of generally low farm profitability. The interest rates indicate the scope for positive&#13;
interest rates as a few credit schemes were charging interest rates in excess of the inflation rate (35.0&#13;
percent) in 1996. The wide variations in lending interest rate among the rural credit schemes also&#13;
indicates the presence of market segmentation within the rural finance system in the country. This is&#13;
mainly because most credit schemes are location-specific and are surrounded by imperfect information.&#13;
2.17   Despite the impressive growth of farmers' associations (82 in 1996) in the last two years, most of&#13;
them are not yet ready to function as effective financial intermediaries. For them to assume this role,&#13;
intensive training of their voluntary staff and establishment of satisfactory accounting systems would be&#13;
absolutely necessary. Lenders, like KAFC, should help with this training if they want to make use of&#13;
these associations as intermediaries.&#13;
D.    GOVERNMENT STRATEGY FOR RURAL FINANCE&#13;
2.18   The findings of a Rural Finance Survey (1996) conducted during the preparation of this project,&#13;
indicate that prospects for establishing a commercially viable rural finance system are good. The process&#13;
would require a combination of "top-down" and "bottom-up" approach. In 1996, the State Commission&#13;
on Rural Finance, endorsed a Rural Finance Strategy (prepared by an inter-agency Working Group with&#13;
IDA technical assistance) which embraces this approach. In the short-term, Government has established&#13;
a new interim credit agency, the KAFC, to manage the delivery of credit to the nascent private farming&#13;
and agribusiness sectors during the transition. KAFC will be professionally managed and will operate&#13;
with full autonomy through an independent Board of Directors. In the medium and long-term,&#13;
Government intends to establish an institutional framework for providing financial services to rural&#13;
communities on a commercially sustainable basis. This intention will be achieved through the promotion&#13;
of community-based and managed financial institutions. These community financial institutions will be&#13;
operated on the basis of cooperative principles, emphasizing self-help, democracy, and cost-&#13;
effectiveness. Technical assistance will be required for KAFC and the community financial institutions.&#13;
The proposed project would be the first phase for implementing this strategy.&#13;
E.    RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.19   IDA's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), approved by the Board during the presentation of the&#13;
Agricultural Privatization and Enterprise Adjustment Credit (APEAC) on June 28, 1995 is focused on&#13;
four priority areas: adjustment lending, agricultural/natural resource management, energy, and social&#13;
sectors. Recovery in the agricultural sector is a critical element of IDA's assistance program for&#13;
economic growth and poverty reduction. Within the CAS framework, IDA's assistance strategy for the&#13;
rural sector consists of policy-based lending in support of structural reforms and investment lending in&#13;
key sector. Structural reform credits with relevance to agriculture include: (a) the Privatization and&#13;
Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit (PESAC) which initiated liberalization of trade policies and the&#13;
price system, and the improvement of the regulatory framework for private sector development; (b) the&#13;
APEAC which deepens market and pricing liberalization in agriculture and fosters the development of&#13;
competitive markets through enterprise privatization and private sector development; (c) an Institutional&#13;
Development Fund (IDF) grant to facilitate government infrastructures in land reform and farm&#13;
restructuring; and (d) the Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FINSAC) to restructure the banking sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
and make it competitive. Building on the policy framework established under these operations, the&#13;
proposed Rural Finance Project would provide emergency private farm and agribusiness enterprises&#13;
access to financial resources to exploit the production and market opportunities being created by the&#13;
reform programs.&#13;
2.20   In addition to the above policy-based operations, IDA's investment resulting in agriculture&#13;
include the following operations: (a) Sheep Development Project (SDP), which recently became&#13;
effective, and which aims to privatize, and increase profitability, efficiency and to increase export-&#13;
orientation in the sheep industry; (b) Agricultural Support Services Project (ASSP), planned for FY98,&#13;
which would establish adaptive research and advisory services, and support farm restructuring; (c) to be&#13;
followed by a Land Registration Project in FY99 for emerging private farmers and it would restructure&#13;
the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources to become a service-provider under market-economy&#13;
conditions; (d) Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (IRP), planned for FY98, which would provide for&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance of the major irrigation infrastructure and it would be followed by an On-&#13;
Farm Irrigation Project in FY2000 to support on-farm irrigation investments and services; (e) People's&#13;
Initiative Project, planned for FY98, would provide for establishment of an institutional framework for&#13;
enabling the poorest to have access to financial services; and (f) Rural Finance Project (RFP) would&#13;
establish an institutional framework for commercially sustainable delivery of credit to private farmers&#13;
and agribusiness enterprises in the short and long-term. RFP would complement the existing and&#13;
proposed investments in the agricultural sector under IDA's assistance program.&#13;
F.     BANK EXPERIENCE IN RURAL FINANCE&#13;
2.21   Bank experience in supporting rural finance projects has been generally unsatisfactory in the&#13;
past. Until recently, the Bank's support to rural finance was based on an active role for government&#13;
through direct interventions such as subsidized interest rates and state-owned and controlled rural&#13;
financial institutions. This approach did not succeed in achieving the goals of income expansion and&#13;
poverty alleviation. In recent years, the Bank has adopted a "new approach" in rural finance. This&#13;
involves a minimalist market-oriented role for government, and places emphasis on creating a favorable&#13;
policy environment and a supportive legal and regulatory framework for rural financial intermediation.&#13;
2.22   The "new approach" has given rise to a growing number of successful rural financial institutions&#13;
which provide potentially replicable or adaptable methodologies. The most important elements for&#13;
successful development of a rural finance system include the following:&#13;
* Appropriate governance, including clearly defined and enforced powers and responsibilities&#13;
of decision-making entities and individuals;&#13;
* Management must have autonomy and accountability for operational decisions;&#13;
* Clients' interests must be fully represented;&#13;
* Clearly defined strategies and objectives;&#13;
* Motivated and skilled staff, and staff training and incentives aimed at improved&#13;
performance;&#13;
* Innovative low-cost mechanisms and procedures for credit delivery, including mobile-&#13;
banking in remote areas and group lending;&#13;
* Positive lending interest rates and high repayment rates;&#13;
* Risk diversification through lending to both agricultural and non-agricultural activities, and&#13;
geographic diversification; and&#13;
* Excellent management information system (MIS) which enables the monitoring of loans,&#13;
individual client records and staff performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
2.23   Taking the above experience into account, the proposed project's design features include the&#13;
following:&#13;
*  KAFC charter provides for operational autonomy through the board of directors and all&#13;
operational decisions would be made by the management (para. 3.05);&#13;
*  KAFC would be adequately capitalized and would have financial autonomy once it is fully&#13;
capitalized in the third year of operation (para. 3.07);&#13;
*  KAFC charter provides for eventual participation of the private sector in its ownership&#13;
(Annex D);&#13;
*  Responsibility and accountability of key management positions in KAFC (including those&#13;
held by consultants) have been clearly defined (Annex B and C);&#13;
*  KAFC would observe prudential norms that are normally required for commercial financing&#13;
or banking institutions (para. 3.06);&#13;
*  KAFC's objectives and strategies are commercially oriented and would be constantly&#13;
updated through revisions of its corporate plans (paras. 3.09 - 3.14);&#13;
* KAFC would lend at positive interest rates right from the start (para. 3.12);&#13;
* The expatriate financial controller would design and implement an effective computer-based&#13;
management information system (Annex C);&#13;
* SFCOP would be demand-driven and its implementation would be based on beneficiary&#13;
participation (para. 4.01);&#13;
* SFCOP would be implemented on a pilot basis to permit some flexibility to learn and&#13;
eventually lead to establishment of rural financial intermediaries (paras. 3.01 and 4.01); and&#13;
* innovative low-cost credit delivery mechanisms and procedures, including mobile credit&#13;
teams in KAFC field offices, screening of loan applications and repayment enforcement by&#13;
farmers' organizations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

III.   THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.01   The proposed project has two primary objectives: (a) in the short-term, it would establish an&#13;
interim institutional arrangement for lending to the agricultural and agribusiness sectors which presently&#13;
have no access to commercial bank credit; and (b) in the medium and long-term, it would provide the&#13;
basis for developing community-based financial services for the rural population. The former objective&#13;
would be implemented through the Kyrgyz Agricultural Finance Corporation (KAFC). The latter&#13;
objective would be implemented through a Small Farmers Credit Outreach Program (SFCOP). This&#13;
program would be implemented on a pilot basis to permit the necessary flexibility to learn and&#13;
eventually would lead to the establishment of rural financial intermediaries (RFIs) based on cooperative&#13;
principles. SFCOP would test specific mechanisms for credit delivery to poor households and develop&#13;
self-help organizations to facilitate poor household's access to commercial credit and other financial&#13;
services. These objectives have been translated into monitorable performance indicators (Annex D).&#13;
B.    SUMMARY PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.02   KAFC Component. Support for KAFC, recently established to replace the moribund&#13;
Agroprombank (currently under liquidation within the FINSAC framework), would aim to enable KAFC&#13;
to provide credit on commercial terms to support the ongoing process of farm restructuring, agribusiness&#13;
enterprise privatization, and private sector development in the rural sector. The project would provide a&#13;
line of credit of US$13.0 million equivalent, to support KAFC' s lending operations. During the first two&#13;
years of operation, KAFC would provide short-term/seasonal working capital loans only to private&#13;
farmers and agribusiness enterprises. Later, it would also provide medium/long-term investment loans&#13;
for on-farm and agribusiness development, given excellent performance with short-term lending.&#13;
Support for KAFC's institutional development for capacity building and implementation support is being&#13;
provided through grant funds from the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC) and the European Union&#13;
TACIS.&#13;
3.03   SFCOP Component. Support for this pilot component would begin the process of establishing&#13;
an institutional framework for providing rural financial services on a commercially sustainable basis in&#13;
the rural areas (para. 1.06). This process would, initially, involve promotion of Farmers' Self-Help&#13;
Organizations (FSOs) and, eventually during the second phase, the establishment of Rural Financial&#13;
Intermediaries (RFIs). The promotion of FSOs would involve the following steps: (i) the Borrower&#13;
would contract KAFC to implement SFCOP; (ii) KAFC would establish a separate Department to&#13;
administer SFCOP; (iii) the Department would contract two or three Development Entrepreneurs (DEs)&#13;
to act as financial intermediaries and promoters of FSOs. The DEs would be private firms or NGOs with&#13;
the requisite qualifications and experience. They will promote the establishment of FSOs and lend the&#13;
funds administered by KAFC to individual farmers who are members of the FSOs. An FSO would be a&#13;
(pre-cooperative) group of private farmers pursuing economic objectives, but operating without a joint&#13;
enterprise. This means that members of an FSO would borrow as individuals through the group. There&#13;
would no group borrowing or lending under the FSOs. FSOs would place their main emphasis on&#13;
acquiring economic benefits through self-help in a group and mutual assistance. In contrast to FSOs,&#13;
RFIs would be fully-fledged cooperatives operating with a joint (cooperative) enterprise capable of&#13;
carrying out financial intermediation. RFIs would emphasize the acquiring of economic benefits by&#13;
continuous collaboration organized through a joint enterprise. SFCOP would be limited to providing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
support to the promotion of FSOs only, but it would not support the promotion of RFIs which would&#13;
commence later. The project would support SFCOP's lending program of US$2.0 million equivalent.&#13;
3.04   Institutional and Policy Framework. The project would support priority technical assistance&#13;
under the KAFC and SFCOP components, and promote institutional, legal and policy changes or&#13;
innovations which would directly enhance successful achievement of the project objectives. Institutional&#13;
improvements would involve revision of the KAFC charter, adoption of an appropriate corporate and&#13;
management structure for KAFC, and adoption of appropriate operational policies and procedures for&#13;
KAFC. Legal improvements would consist of establishing a legal framework to facilitate the&#13;
development of FSOs into fully-fledged local financial intermediaries. Policy changes would comprise&#13;
implementation of actions to rationalize the provision of budgetary support to the agricultural credit&#13;
program.  The major agricultural credit policy and institutional issues and proposed actions are&#13;
summarized in Annex A.&#13;
C.    DETAILED PROJECT FEATURES&#13;
I.    The KAFC Component&#13;
3.05   KAFC Establishment and Management. KAFC was established by a Government Decree No.&#13;
303 of July 2, 1996 and was formally registered as a joint stock company in December 1996. KAFC was&#13;
licensed in March 1997 and is supervised by the National Bank of Kyrgyzstan (NBK) as a non-bank&#13;
financial institution. KAFC must observe the rules and regulations applicable to banks on capital&#13;
adequacy ratio, exposure limits, classification of loan portfolio, and provisioning and other prudential&#13;
rules and instructions prescribed by NBK. KAFC's charter incorporates operational and financial&#13;
autonomy through a Board of Directors. The Board of Directors consists of three members representing&#13;
the Government (currently the sole shareholder) and three members representing the private sector (the&#13;
charter provides for private sector's participation in KAFC). The seventh member of the Board is the&#13;
Executive Director of KAFC.  When Government ceases to be the majority shareholder in the&#13;
corporation, the Board would be elected at the annual shareholders' general meeting. KAFC would,&#13;
initially, have three departments for Credit, Finance, and Personnel and Training.  The Credit&#13;
Department, headed by a Credit Manager, would be responsible for lending and loan portfolio&#13;
management. All field offices and staff would be under the Credit Department. KAFC has started&#13;
lending operations in all six oblast. Each oblast office has one senior credit officer (in-charge) assisted by&#13;
two credit officers. These constitute the mobile team which , currently, is responsible for collecting and&#13;
appraising credit applications from both farmers and agribusinesses. Applications which have good&#13;
prospects for succeeding are sent to KAFC head office where they are evaluated by a Loan Committee,&#13;
chaired by the Executive Managing Director. Each field office would be provide with a small rented&#13;
office in the former Agroprombank branch office. Each field office would be equipped with at least one&#13;
four-wheel drive vehicle, one PC, and a telephone/fax. KAFC would closely monitor the performance of&#13;
the field offices to ensure financial viability and to ascertain that the number of clients and volume of&#13;
lending justify maintaining a permanent field office. The Finance Department would be responsible for&#13;
efficient management of the corporation's financial resources, accounting and management information&#13;
system. The Personnel and Training Department would be responsible for personnel and training&#13;
functions, including staff recruitment and training, public relations, and personnel and staff benefits&#13;
policy.&#13;
3.06   KAFC Financial Parameters. KAFC's initial lending operations will be haunted by the legacy&#13;
of credit non-repayment culture that has been nurtured by Agroprombank and the Government&#13;
agricultural credit programs. Against this background, KAFC would need to establish quickly a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
reputation for financial integrity and excellent performance of its loan portfolio. This would require,&#13;
among other things, establishing a sound financial basis and adhering to sound business principles. For&#13;
this purpose, KAFC would adhere to the following financial requirements: (a) the capital to risk assets&#13;
ratio would be maintained at 33 percent but, with satisfactory loan recovery performance, would&#13;
gradually be allowed to fall to a minimum of 25 percent; (b) the maximum loan size for an individual or&#13;
corporate borrower would be limited to 10 percent of the paid-up capital, or US$250,000, whichever is&#13;
smaller; and (c) the minimum debt service ratio, acceptable to KAFC, would be 1:1.5, calculated&#13;
conservatively to take into account tax liabilities and any existing obligation to DEBRA and other&#13;
lenders; (d) KAFC would maintain its loan recovery performance at 75 percent or above. During&#13;
negotiations, it was understood that these financial requirements will be incorporated in the Subsidiary&#13;
Loan and Equity Investment Agreement between KAFC and the Government and in the Lending&#13;
Operational Manual.&#13;
3.07   KAFC Capitalization. To start with a strong financial basis, KAFC would be adequately&#13;
capitalized. The initial registered share capital of KAFC would be US$10.0 million equivalent, but this&#13;
would be increased in line with the envisaged rapid increase in lending. Government would provide,&#13;
until June 30, 1997, som 7.0 million, or US$412,000, as its initial contribution to the share capital. In&#13;
addition, for the first US$2.0 million equivalent withdrawn by KAFC from the IDA Credit account, and&#13;
for 25 percent of all subsequent withdrawals, KAFC would issue shares to Government. The total&#13;
amount of share contributions by Government from the proceeds of the IDA Credit would not exceed&#13;
US$4.75 million equivalent. Government has also paid som 400,000 to cover initial start-up expenses of&#13;
KAFC. In addition, Government has also agreed to transfer as share capital contribution to KAFC the&#13;
proceeds of loan recoveries made by the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR) and&#13;
Regional Administration (RA) from the 1992-96 budgetary credit debt, amounting to som 560 million.&#13;
Likewise, the proceeds from loan recoveries from the budgetary agricultural credit to be lent by the&#13;
MAWR and RA during 1997-99, amounting to som 225 million, will be transferred to KAFC as share&#13;
contribution by the Government. In reality, perhaps only one-third of these loans will be recovered and&#13;
transferred to KAFC. The total amount of equity contribution expected from loan recoveries is som 285.0&#13;
million, or US$17.0 million. It was understood during negotiations that such transfers would be made in&#13;
due course and that the transfers from loan recoveries to KAFC would not exceed 17.0 million. Loan&#13;
recoveries in excess of this amount would be made available to the government treasury. At full&#13;
disbursement of the IDA Credit and transfer of the proceeds from loan recoveries (in 1999), KAFC's&#13;
total paid-up share capital at the beginning of 2000 would be as follows:&#13;
(a)    Government initial share contribution                 $  412,000&#13;
(b)    Government contribution from IDA Credit proceeds      $ 4,750,000&#13;
(c)    Contribution from Government loan recoveries (1992-96)  $11,000,000&#13;
(d)    Contribution from Government loan recoveries (1997-99)  $ 6,000,000&#13;
KAFC total paid-up capital                            $22,162,000&#13;
This amount of paid-up share capital would permit a loan portfolio of approximately US$44.3 million, or&#13;
som 753.5 million at the end of the third year. KAFC charter provides for participation of the private&#13;
sector in KAFC shareholding. KAFC management would develop programs for promoting the sale of&#13;
KAFC shares to private farmers and enterprises, and their organizations.&#13;
3.08   Terms and Conditions of the Subsidiary Loan. Government would bear the foreign exchange&#13;
risk on the proposed IDA credit. About US$8.25 million from the proceeds of the line of credit would be&#13;
on-lent by Government to KAFC in accordance with the terms and conditions of a Subsidiary Loan and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
Equity Investment Agreement satisfactory to IDA. The principal terms and conditions of the Subsidiary&#13;
Loan and Equity Investment Agreement were agreed during negotiations. The execution of this&#13;
agreement is a condition for effectiveness of the IDA Credit. The line of credit would be denominated in&#13;
the local currency (som) with a 1 S-year maturity, including five years of grace. It would bear a variable&#13;
interest rate which would be indexed to the annual inflation rate projected by NBK. The initial interest&#13;
rate to be charged on the Subsidiary Loan would be equal to the annual inflation.&#13;
3.09   The KAFC Lending Program. This program would meet essential financing needs of private&#13;
farm  and agribusiness enterprises.  Private farm  enterprises would consist of individual private&#13;
commercial farmers (with 20 hectares or more under irrigation, or/and a loan requirement in excess of&#13;
US$1,000), farmers' associations, corporate farms, donor-sponsored rural credit schemes, and state and&#13;
collective farms undergoing restructuring. For the last category, KAFC would catalyze the process of&#13;
farm restructuring by requiring implementation of specific actions as loan conditionality. Private&#13;
agribusiness enterprises would comprise private farm input suppliers, agro-processing enterprises,&#13;
contract farming schemes, and farm machinery and equipment hire service enterprises. For short-term&#13;
loans, KAFC would establish a revolving fund account. KAFC would start lending operations in the&#13;
second half of 1997 and by the end of December 1997 is expected to achieve an outstanding loan&#13;
portfolio of US$3.0 million equivalent. This operational level would be consistent with KAFC's initial&#13;
staffing strength (Annex B). During the first two years, KAFC would concentrate on seasonal lending.&#13;
This would permit KAFC sufficient time to train its staff in loan evaluation and processing procedures,&#13;
to get to know its borrowers, and to focus on educating its borrowers that KAFC loans are on commercial&#13;
terms and must be repaid on time and in full.&#13;
3.10   Credit to Private Farm Enterprises. KAFC would provide both initial working capital credit&#13;
and on-farm investment credit to private farmers. Working capital credit would finance purchase of&#13;
seasonal inputs and hired labor. On-farm investment lending would be diversified and include&#13;
construction and rehabilitation of irrigation and farm buildings, livestock breeding stock, and farm&#13;
machinery and equipment and any other investments assessed to be economically and financially viable&#13;
and within the capacity of the beneficiary to undertake and manage. Sub-loans under this category&#13;
would have to demonstrate financial viability (on the basis of satisfactory debt service coverage ratios)&#13;
and must include an agreed farm production/business plan. In case of ex-state/collective farms still&#13;
undergoing restructuring, an agreed monitorable restructuring action plan would be part of the loan&#13;
agreement between KAFC and the borrower. KAFC would also assure that each proposed sub-loan meets&#13;
minimum environmental requirements in accordance with IDA environmental guidelines. Initially,&#13;
KAFC's lending strategy would rely on providing credit to existing officially registered farming family&#13;
associations, restructuring state/collective farms, corporate farms (para. 1.04), donor-sponsored rural&#13;
credit schemes (para. 2.10) and agribusiness enterprises as financial intermediaries.  To these&#13;
intermediaries, KAFC would lend at a lower spread because such lending is likely to be less risky and to&#13;
involve lower transactions costs than lending directly to individual farmers. In order to be eligible to this&#13;
discount, such intermediaries would have to demonstrate: (i) satisfactory management capacity to&#13;
effectively evaluate loan applications, administer credit to and recover credit from their members; (ii)&#13;
agree to introduce and implement satisfactory accounting system for lending operations; (iii) agree to&#13;
assume the on-lending risk on basis of joint and several liability; and (iv) provide tangible and adequate&#13;
collateral. For the purpose of linking credit with trade, KAFC would support agribusiness enterprises to&#13;
establish purchase order or contractfarming schemes for selected commodities. Continued participation&#13;
of the intermediaries in the KAFC lending program would depend on their loan recovery and payment&#13;
performance and their continued ability to meet the eligibility criteria. Borrower's contribution to the&#13;
sub-loan amount would not be less than 20 percent. It is expected that most of the borrower's&#13;
contribution would be in non-cash form (e.g., family labor, retained seed). KAFC would not finance the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
purchase of land and the refinancing of existing debts. Farmers or farmers' organizations with&#13;
outstanding overdue loans from other lenders, including Agroprombank and Government, would be&#13;
ineligible for KAFC loans. KAFC field staff would cooperate and coordinate closely with the local&#13;
agricultural advisory staff, and with NGO officials who provide advisory service to farmers. Wherever&#13;
practical, a credit-technical advice partnership approach would be adopted to ensure optimal use of&#13;
credit in the adoption of new technologies by farmers.&#13;
3.11   Credit to Agribusiness. KAFC would provide initial working capital credit and investment&#13;
credit to small and medium-scale private agribusiness enterprises engaged in processing, trading, or&#13;
provision of agriculture-related services. The project would also lend to farm machinery leasing&#13;
enterprises. KAFC would lend direct to eligible private agribusiness enterprises. To be eligible, sub-&#13;
loans in these categories would have to demonstrate satisfactory economic and financial viability as&#13;
measured by rates of return and debt service coverage ratio. All sub-loans for agro-processing and farm&#13;
input trading would be subject to environmental assessment by KAFC. Minimum sub-loan size under&#13;
this category would be US$1,000. Sub-loans for agro-industries would finance new investments, or&#13;
modernization, rehabilitation or expansion of existing production facilities and include permanent&#13;
working capital. Again, KAFC would not finance land purchase and existing debts. Borrower's&#13;
contribution to sub-project cost would not be less than 30 percent. KAFC's term lending would, however,&#13;
be postponed to the third year of operation to allow KAFC staff to gain operational experience with short&#13;
term lending and to coincide with the phasing out of government transfers to the agricultural credit&#13;
program (para. 3.28).&#13;
3.12   KAFC's On-lending Terms and Conditions. KAFC would bear the repayment risk on its sub-&#13;
loans (denominated in the local currency). Sub-loan repayment periods for farming and agribusiness&#13;
activities would be based on the projected cashflow and borrower's repayment capacity. Repayment of&#13;
seasonal loans for farming operations and working capital loans would be dovetailed to the&#13;
production/service cycle and, as a rule, the repayment period would not exceed 12 months. Sub-loan&#13;
repayment periods for on-farm investments, farm machinery and equipment, transportation equipment,&#13;
and agro-processing investments would not exceed the useful life of the investment financed, and, as&#13;
rule, should not exceed 10 years, including a grace period of no more than three years. Sub-loans would&#13;
be denominated and repayable in the local currency. They would bear interest rates that are positive in&#13;
real terms. Interest rates on short-term sub-loans would be revised once a year in October to ensure that&#13;
such rates on seasonal loans do not change before maturity dates. Term sub-loans would be variable and&#13;
would be indexed to the projected rate of inflation at the time the sub-loan is made. The basis of&#13;
KAFC's interest rate structure for short- and long-term loans would be its borrowing rate as stated in&#13;
para. 3.08. KAFC would add onto this basic rate its margin that would range between 5 and 8 percent,&#13;
depending on the risk rating of a sub-loan, loan size, intermediary loans, quality of collateral and other&#13;
considerations. The basic interest rate for 1997 was agreed during negotiations. Given the uncertainty&#13;
about the enforceability of secured transactions under existing Kyrgyz laws, KAFC would, initially, not&#13;
make asset-based loans (i.e., loans secured by assets without demonstrated cashflow to cover repayment&#13;
of principal and interest).&#13;
3.13   Collateralfor Loans. Laws on secured transactions, including collateral and mortgage are still&#13;
lacking in the Kyrgyz Republic. Drafts on Collateral Law and on a Land Code have been submitted to&#13;
the country's legislature, but have not been enacted. A law on pledges was enacted in April 1997. The&#13;
enactment of these laws is surrounded by legislative uncertainties. Lending under the proposed project&#13;
would not rely on security offered by borrowers, but largely on farm profitability and community-&#13;
enforced incentives. The lack of these laws, however, would not jeopardize the achievement of project&#13;
objectives in the medium-term. The priority for the legal advisor to be hired by KAFC would be to assess&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
the implications of the existing and proposed laws on KAFC lending, with special reference to the&#13;
creation, registration, and enforceability of secured transactions. The findings and recommendations&#13;
resulting from this review would determine, to a large extent, KAFC practices on secured transactions.&#13;
3.14   KAFC  Lending Policies, Procedures, and Business Plan. KAFC  management and&#13;
organizational structure would be lean and cost effective. The corporate and management structure&#13;
presented in Annex B was agreed during appraisal and confirmed at negotiations. KAFC management&#13;
would prepare a detailed draft lending operations manual and submit it to IDA for review. The adoption&#13;
of the manual by the KAFC Board is a condition of effectiveness. It was also agreed during appraisal&#13;
that external auditors will be hired and retained annually by KAFC to review at random 10 percent of its&#13;
outstanding loan portfolio and recommend corrective actions. KAFC's accounting and auditing would&#13;
be in accordance with international accounting practices and standards and in accordance with the chart&#13;
of accounts for commercial banks prescribed by NBK. To underpin its lending operations during 1997&#13;
to 1999, KAFC will prepare a Business or Corporate Plan satisfactory to IDA. The plan would reflect&#13;
KAFC's initial operational experience and devise strategic and realistic approaches to resolve pertinent&#13;
issues in credit delivery under rapidly changing social and economic environment. In view of this, a&#13;
draft of this Corporate Plan will be completed and submitted to IDA for review not later than January&#13;
31, 1998, and carry it out thereafter, subject to comment by IDA.&#13;
H.    Pilot SFCOP Component&#13;
3.15   SFCOP Institutional Framework The project would support, on a pilot basis, lending to poor&#13;
farmers (para. 1.06) through a line of credit and development of farmers' self-help organizations (para.&#13;
3.03). The institutional framework for implementing the program is described in chapter 4. The line of&#13;
credit and the promotion of FSOs would be administered by a separate Department in KAFC. For this&#13;
purpose, the execution of a Grant Administration Agreement between KAFC and the Ministry of Finance&#13;
will be a condition of disbursementfor SFCOP. KAFC would administer the implementation of SFCOP&#13;
at a fee sufficient to cover the cost of its departmental staff. The SFCOP Department would be headed&#13;
by a Program  Manager with specific qualifications and terms of reference (Annex E).  These&#13;
qualifications and terms of reference were agreed during appraisal and confirmed at negotiations. The&#13;
Program Manager's employment by KAFC is a condition for credit effectiveness. He/she would be&#13;
responsible and accountable to the KAFC Executive Director for efficient management of the program.&#13;
The SFCOP Department in KAFC has been established as agreed during negotiations. The institutional&#13;
framework for implementing the program would consist of the Department; two or three local and/or&#13;
foreign private Development Entrepreneurs (DEs) to be contracted by the Department to act as financial&#13;
intermediaries and promoters of FSOs on an agent basis; and FSOs to provide members' access to credit&#13;
and advise on better use of credit and agricultural advisory services. This institutional framework&#13;
incorporates the major best practices of existing rural credit schemes in the country and in foreign&#13;
countries with similar socio-economic environment (Box 1). The DEs would be private sector firms or&#13;
NGOs with the requisite institutional capacity and experience to play the dual role of a financial&#13;
intermediary and promoter of FSOs. In their capacity as agents of the Department, they would perform a&#13;
range of tasks associated with lending and institution building for small farmers (Box 6). The DE&#13;
contracts would be based on clear and monitorable indicators related to outreach and self-sustainability&#13;
of the FSOs (para. 3.40). Minimum performance indicators would be agreed ex-ante with the&#13;
Department and incorporated into the contract and annual work plans. DEs who fail to meet these&#13;
minimum performance indicators would have their annual contracts terminated at expiration. Those who&#13;
exceed the agreed minimum performance indicators would have their annual contracts renewed&#13;
automatically upon expiration and they would receive a performance bonus in addition to the basic&#13;
contract price. The bonus system would be agreed ex-ante and incorporated in the contract.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

BoQ I&#13;
Rural Credit Best Practices&#13;
Best practices in agricultural production lending in the Kyrgyz Republic and elsewhere&#13;
include:&#13;
- Extend credit within a "development parmership package' involving training and advice&#13;
- Deliver credit to eligible farmers as members of a group&#13;
- Where practical deliver credit in-kind to new borrowers&#13;
- Extend credit in "steps", starting with small seasonal loans&#13;
- Extend credit for inputs with greatest impact on farm profitability&#13;
- Adopt a "get tough" policy toward repayment of loans&#13;
- Set loan repayment to dovetail crop/commodity production cycle&#13;
- Loan application screening by the group is the best form of loan security&#13;
- Make group responsible for individual loan monitoring and reporting&#13;
- Non-collateral substitutes must be emphasized in loan risk management&#13;
- Several and joint liability of a group without a joint enterprise is not helpful&#13;
3.16   SFCOP Target Group. The program's target group includes private farming households at or&#13;
slightly above the poverty line (para. 1.06). These households do not have access to institutional credit&#13;
nor would they be able to meet eligibility criteria for KAFC lending (para. 3.10). In the past, the&#13;
Government credit program has by-passed these poor farmers in favor of large public sector farms.&#13;
Lending to these small private farmers, on an individual basis, would be prohibitively expensive and&#13;
risky. In order to enable them to have access to institutional credit, they would be organized into groups.&#13;
Each household would be cultivating an average of about 5 or more hectares under irrigation, or whose&#13;
average seasonal credit requirement would be less than US$1,000 equivalent. Most of these farmers fall&#13;
under the "private individual farm" category, estimated at approximately 23,000 by the end of 1996. This&#13;
number is increasing with further restructuring of family farming associations, state and collective farms.&#13;
Most of these farmers would be having access to institutional credit for the first time since they became&#13;
private farmers unless they have "graduated" from the PBD lending program which is intended for&#13;
households below the poverty line. To be eligible to participate in the program, these farmers would have&#13;
to be organized under an FSO with the criteria described in Box 2. The FSOs would be voluntary groups&#13;
or associations of private farmers with the aim of accessing institutional credit over an extended period.&#13;
The major characteristics of the envisaged FSOs and summarized in Box 3. Most of these FSOs would&#13;
initially operate without a joint or cooperative enterprise through which group lending or borrowing&#13;
could take place. However, most FSOs would be established with the ultimate objective of eventually&#13;
becoming cooperative societies providing financial services to members through the cooperative&#13;
enterprise. The DEs would spearhead the promotion of and lending to FSOs. The DEs would promote&#13;
the formation of FSOs through the provision of organizational and legal support, member training, and&#13;
lending to individual members of the FSO. Loans to FSO members would be exclusively seasonal to&#13;
purchase essential farm inputs only. Initially, FSOs would be pre-cooperatives established during the&#13;
transition period with the objectives of: (i) familiarizing members with the organizational and&#13;
management of a cooperative society; (ii) teaching members how to work together in a cooperative&#13;
group; and (iii) providing a practical opportunity to members to establish a cooperative enterprise step by&#13;
step. An FSO would be allowed to participate under the program for a maximum of two years only, after&#13;
which it would graduate into a fully-fledged RFI of some type and become eligible to participate in the&#13;
KAFC or ADB programs. FSOs that fail to meet eligibility criteria of the KAFC lending program after&#13;
two years of operation would no longer be eligible to participate in the SFCOP. Similarly, FSOs that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
successfully graduate out of the program, but later fail to continue their participation in the KAFC and&#13;
ADB programs would not be granted re-entry into the SFCOP. Initially, the number of members per FSO&#13;
would be limited to a maximum of 50 farm enterprises. This number would foster homogeneity and trust&#13;
within the group. However, as FSOs develop and "graduate" into RFIs, there would be a need for&#13;
amalgamation of two or more FSOs to achieve economy of scale in providing financial services to&#13;
members.&#13;
Box 2&#13;
Eligibilitv Criteria for Participation in the SFCOP by Farmers&#13;
In order to participate in the SFCOP, farmers would have to meet the following&#13;
minimum requirements:&#13;
- be a registered and licensed farm enterprise&#13;
- possess an "akt" on the farm enterprise&#13;
- farm enterprise has at least 5 ha under irrigation, or a minimum&#13;
loan requirement of US$300 equivalent&#13;
- producing at least one cash crop capable of generating adequate&#13;
cashflow for loan repayment&#13;
- member of a participating FSO&#13;
3.17 SFCOP Scope and Lending Procedures. SFCOP lending would be in accordance with the "best&#13;
practices" specified in Box I and would be targeted to farmers meeting the specified eligibility criteria&#13;
(Box 2). The program would be implemented on an oblast-based phasing, so that implementation in the&#13;
first year would be limited to Naryn and Issyk-kul oblasts, to be followed by another two which are&#13;
relatively poor, contiguous and advanced in farm restructuring (i.e., have large numbers of private farm&#13;
enterprises). In the last year, the remaining two oblasts would be covered. The program implementation&#13;
would be extended to other oblasts, only if the program's objectives are being satisfactorily achieved in&#13;
the initial two oblasts. Under the program, DEs, contracted by the Department to act as agents in&#13;
intermediating credit, would be responsible for promoting the establishment of FSOs among the target&#13;
farmers and for administering credit to individual FSO members, using the credit funds allocated to&#13;
them, on the basis of an annual contract with the Department. The Department would assume the&#13;
lending risk. The DEs would be responsible for making available to and recovering from FSO members&#13;
credit funds with due diligence and efficiency and in conformity with guidelines issued by the&#13;
Department from time to time. Lending under the program would be limited to seasonal credit for on-&#13;
farm inputs. The method of loan disbursement (cash or in-kind inputs) would be decided by the DE on&#13;
the basis of repayment experience of FSO members and local availability of input suppliers and their&#13;
willingness to participate in a "credit-input supplier partnership package". Under this package, DEs&#13;
would lend predominantly in-kind (over 80 percent of loan amount) by issuing borrowers a voucher that&#13;
would be redeemed for inputs at a program participating private input supplier. Upon submission of a&#13;
delivery note signed by the borrower, the input supplier would receive cash payment from the voucher-&#13;
issuing DE. Lending would be done on the basis of a three-party Loan Agreement signed by the DE, the&#13;
borrowing member, and an authorized representative of the FSO to which the borrower is a member&#13;
(Annex E). Under this arrangement, the FSO member would be the borrower of record, and the FSO&#13;
would be responsible for screening and endorsing the member's loan application and for enforcing loan&#13;
repayment by the member. FSOs would screen and recommend their individual members' applications&#13;
on the basis of their creditworthiness in terms of the viability of their farming operations (cashflow&#13;
analysis) and personal character (including performance in meeting financial and other obligations).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
Individual members of an FSO would complete and submit their loan applications to their respective&#13;
FSO. A simple loan application would be used by the DEs (Annex F).&#13;
Box3&#13;
FSO Major Characteristics&#13;
FSO is a general term which covers all forms of organizations having a&#13;
cooperative nature, including the following:&#13;
- managed by members for members voluntarily -&#13;
- objective is to facilitate members' access to credit&#13;
over an extended period&#13;
- loose or cohesive grouping based on clans or&#13;
location/settement&#13;
- group may or may not operate a joint enterprise&#13;
(cooperative enterprise) through it renders&#13;
services to members&#13;
l decision making by members only&#13;
(democratic element)&#13;
l member participation in self-help activities, including&#13;
loan application screening and repayment enforcement&#13;
- small and homogenous membership groups&#13;
- advantages in excess of pure profit-sharing&#13;
3.18   SFCOP Lending Terms and Conditions.  The program's funds for the line of credit and&#13;
institution building would be transferred to the Department as a grant through the regular budget process.&#13;
However, the Department's lending interest rate structure would be similar to that of KAFC. The DEs&#13;
would on-lend to FSO members at a basic interest rates indexed to the NBK-projected rate of inflation at&#13;
the time the loan is made plus a margin of 6 percentage points. The FSOs would be critical to the&#13;
success of the program. Their role would include the functions outlined in Box 4. The DEs would lend&#13;
to eligible members of FSOs after the members, as a group, have agreed to perform the functions of an&#13;
FSO (Box 4). All lending under the program would be in the local currency. The interest rate under the&#13;
program for 1997/98 will be 30 percent as agreed during negotiations. The minimum loan size would&#13;
be US$300 per member, while the maximum loan size would be US$1,000 per member. Borrowing&#13;
members would be required to contribute not less than 20 percent of the total cost of the project for&#13;
which the loan is requested. This member's equity contribution could be in non-cash form (e.g., own&#13;
labor, land, or retained seeds, provided they are part of the proposed project's costs). Loan repayment&#13;
period would be matched with the production cycle of the commodity for which the loan is being&#13;
requested, but would not exceed 12 months. Due to uncertainty about the legal enforceability of tangible&#13;
loan securities (e.g., collateral on houses, land), lending under the program would not be asset-based.&#13;
Instead, collateral substitutes (including cut-off from future access to loans for FSOs with defaulting&#13;
members, publication of names of defaulters on local public notice boards) would be adopted to&#13;
complement the borrower's creditworthiness. The borrower's "akt" (lease certificate) would, however,&#13;
be kept by the FSO as documentary evidence for use rights on the farm by the borrowing member. FSOs&#13;
achieving less than 80 percent loan recoveries would be automatically excluded from participating in the&#13;
program. FSOs with a perfect loan recovery performance would be allowed to increase the average size&#13;
of loans for the members in the following season. The Department would also exchange lists of&#13;
defaulters with KAFC and other credit schemes or lenders.&#13;

FSOs participating in the SFCOP would play the following role:&#13;
- carry out preliminary screening of member loan applications and&#13;
endorsing those found creditworthy&#13;
- scrutinize individual member's capacity to incur debt and repay&#13;
- establish contact with DEs to determine which individual loan&#13;
applications are acceptable and should be submitted for consideration&#13;
- negotiate loan terms and conditions with relevant DE&#13;
- arrange individual member's loan guarantees or security, including&#13;
depositing of member's "akt' with the DE&#13;
- co-sign individual members' loan agreements&#13;
- supervise the use of loan by individual member in accordance&#13;
widt agreed terms&#13;
- organize and enforce loan repayment by individual members&#13;
- arrange full repayment of defaults of individual members in order&#13;
to maintain access to credit under the program&#13;
- negotiate reflow of funds with DE arrange training of members&#13;
by DE&#13;
III.    The Policy and Institutional Framework&#13;
3.19    The project would support technical assistance and training for both KAFC and SFCOP, and&#13;
promote the development of enabling environment for achieving the project objectives in the long term.&#13;
The latter would comprise the promotion of institutional, legal and policy changes or innovation.&#13;
3.20    Institutional Development TA.  The institutional framework for implementing the proposed&#13;
project would consist of the KAFC, Department, DEs, and FSOs. The proposed project would support&#13;
priority TA required by these institutions to enhance the achievement of the project objectives. Key TA&#13;
activities would include support for KAFC management, and for implementation of the SFCOP.&#13;
Accordingly, the main TA sub-components would consist of the following:&#13;
3.21    Support for KAFC Management.  KAFC  management would be critical to its success. The&#13;
Board of KAFC would recruit, on competitive basis, and retain three consultants through a foreign&#13;
financial institution or bank to provide managers for credit operations, finance, and personnel and&#13;
training during the first three years. The terms of reference for these consultants would include setting up&#13;
and operating KAFC (Annex C). KAFC management would also recruit three local counterpart staff and&#13;
several other professional staff (Annex B) on competitive basis. The proposed project would finance the&#13;
consultants for three years and the incremental cost of local staff during the first year of operation. Local&#13;
staff expenses in subsequent years would be covered by operating revenue. KAFC management team&#13;
would be recruited urgently to set-up and manage the corporation before the beginning of the 1997/98&#13;
crop season. Part of the start-up costs would be covered by a PPF of US$70,000 and budgetary resources&#13;
allocated to KAFC by the Government. TA under this component is being supported by a Swiss grant in&#13;
the first year of operation and by an EU-TACIS grant in the second and third year. KAFC staff training&#13;
would be extensive and would include training in appraisal methodology, loan portfolio management,&#13;
international accounting, financial services marketing, and strategies for savings mobilization. The&#13;
proposed project would support this training component. The project would also support the purchase of&#13;
essential equipment, including computers and complementary software.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Box 5&#13;
Eligibility Criteria for DEs&#13;
In order to qualify for participation in the implementation of the SFCOP,&#13;
firms or NGOs would be required to meet the following minimum&#13;
requirements:&#13;
- have license or permission to operate in the country as a&#13;
juridical person&#13;
- successful track record in managing rural financial programs in&#13;
similar socio-economic environment&#13;
- familiarity with provision of advisory services to farmers on&#13;
cooperative groups&#13;
- demonstrated institutional capacity (rnanagement and staffing)&#13;
to promote establishment of FSOs and to administer credit&#13;
effectively.&#13;
- demonstrated institutional capacity (accounting system and&#13;
financial integrity) to manage financial resources efficiently&#13;
- demonstrated institutional capacity to nmeet reporting&#13;
requirements for lending activities&#13;
- highly motivated to achieve results on the ground on the basis&#13;
of agreed performance targets&#13;
- demonstrated willingness to innovate and adopt flexible&#13;
approaches in group formation and credit extension&#13;
- agree to execute agency contract with Department with due diligence&#13;
and efficiency&#13;
3.22    Support for SFCOP Implementation. Critical to the implementation of the outreach program&#13;
would be the establishment of the Department and employment of private sector agencies to promote the&#13;
establishment of FSOs. The Department would be key in managing the program's funds and in&#13;
coordinating the planning and implementation of SFCOP. A Program Manager would be employed for&#13;
the entire project period. The first two years of the Program Manager would be funded by EU-TACIS,&#13;
and the last year would be financed from SFCOP operational revenue. Two local specialists (a Program&#13;
Supervisor and a Monitoring and Evaluation Officer) would be employed to assist the Program Manager.&#13;
Employment of local staff would be financed by the annual administrative budget of the KAFC which&#13;
would be partially funded by the fee that KAFC would charge for administering the program. However,&#13;
the Department's administrative budget for the first year would be financed in advance by the&#13;
Government at the signing of the Administration Agreement. The Department would contract, as agents,&#13;
private firms or NGOs as DEs to promote the establishment of FSOs and to administer credit to members&#13;
of FSOs. The DE agency contract would be initially for one year, renewable, for another year upon&#13;
satisfactory performance. The role to be played by the DEs is summarized in Box 6. The participating&#13;
DEs would be required to meet certain eligibility criteria (Box 5). Local firms or NGOs may not have&#13;
the requisite qualifications and experience, but they would be allowed to establish consortia with foreign&#13;
firms or NGOs who may be able to meet the eligibility criteria. The total number of DE contracts by the&#13;
third year would be three and the average cost of each contract would not exceed US$100,000 per year.&#13;
The project would finance these agency contracts during the project period. DEs with excellent credit&#13;
recovery performance (in excess of 95 percent) would be permitted to retain the credit reflows to enable&#13;
them expand their outreach. SFCOP would have separate accounts for its operations and would be&#13;
audited separately.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
Role of DEs in Implementini SFCOP&#13;
The DEs would play the following critical role in the implementation of&#13;
SFCOP:&#13;
- administering credit to eligible FSO members&#13;
- promoting establishment of FSOs&#13;
- providing training to FSO members&#13;
- providing organizational and legal support to FSOs&#13;
- developing bookkeeping system for FSOs&#13;
- appraising applications endorsed by FSOs&#13;
- appraising loan collateral endorsed by FSOs&#13;
- supervising loans in cooperation with FSOs&#13;
- recovery loans from FSO members&#13;
- liaising with participating input suppliers in disbursement of in-kind loans&#13;
- liaising with agricultural advisory staff in loan appraisal and training in&#13;
improved use of loans&#13;
- preparing annual outreach plans as a basis for contracting with the&#13;
Department&#13;
- preparing period reports required by the Department&#13;
- monitoring performance of participating FSOs&#13;
-_maintaining requisite accounts&#13;
3.23    Supportfor Training. Training of local staff for KAFC and SFCOP as well as for members of&#13;
FSOs would be critical to building local capacity to develop the rural finance system in the long term.&#13;
The project would support the following training activities:&#13;
3.24    KAFC Staff Training. KAFC would prepare a training program with a practical orientation and&#13;
incorporate it in its business plan. All newly recruited staff would undergo training, starting with short&#13;
orientation courses. The objectives of such courses would include briefing to the new staff on the&#13;
corporation and its mandate, loan products, lending policies and procedures, lending terms and&#13;
conditions, loan appraisal methodology, loan processing and loan accounting. The short in-house&#13;
courses would be combined with field visits and real field case studies in which the staff would identify&#13;
investment opportunities, assess credit demand, update farm data on number, size, production costs,&#13;
revenue of existing farm enterprises. These local courses would be complemented by foreign short&#13;
courses for best performing staff. KAFC would accelerate its staff training program to acquire adequate&#13;
institutional capacity for expanded lending to replace the government agricultural credit program by the&#13;
end of 1999. This training program would be spell out in KAFC's corporate plan for 1998-2000. KAFC&#13;
would also implement an outreach program aimed at informing its potential clients and the public at&#13;
large about its mandate and operations. For this purpose, it would prepare publicity materials and&#13;
radio/TV programs. The project would support both the KAFC training and publicity programs in the&#13;
first two years of operation. Subsequently, training and publicity programs would be financed from&#13;
operating revenue.&#13;
3.25    SFCOP Training Support. Department's local staff training would be provided by KAFC and&#13;
would also involve study tours intended to familiarize them with the operations and coordination of&#13;
micro-credit programs by foreign agencies. Training for SFCOP also would involve members of FSOs.&#13;
The training of FSO members would be done by the DEs who would receive annual allocations for this&#13;
purpose from the Department on the basis of mutually agreed outreach programs. Training of FSO&#13;
members would enable the members to operate as a cohesive group based on trust and democratic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
principles, and to enable them carry out the self-help activities of their organization effectively (Box 4).&#13;
This training would aim at enabling the FSOs to function effectively and "graduate" into RFIs at the end&#13;
of the second year of their participation in the outreach program. The project would support the FSO&#13;
training programs.&#13;
3.26   Policy Changes and Institutional Innovations. Policy changes and institutional innovations&#13;
would be necessary to facilitate achievement of the overall objectives of the project. The project would&#13;
promote the implementation of several policy and institutional actions. A summary of the objectives of&#13;
these policy and institutional changes the proposed actions and their timing are presented in Annex A&#13;
and are summarized below.&#13;
3.27   Policy Changes. The existing policy environment is fraught with several distortions which&#13;
would not be conducive for the development of a commercially sustainable rural finance system in the&#13;
country. The following policy-induced distortions would be removed:&#13;
*  Interest Rate Subsidy.  Current lending interest rates for agricultural credit programs,&#13;
operated by Government and donors, are subsidized because they neither reflect the&#13;
prevailing market rates nor the volatile rate of inflation. The following agreements were&#13;
reached with Government during appraisal and confirmed at negotiations: (i) the&#13;
Government agricultural credit program for the 1997 production season (November 1996-&#13;
April 1997) would be administered at an interest rate of 10 percent, and (ii) during the 1998&#13;
and 1999 production seasons, lending interest rates for Government, KAFC and SFCOP&#13;
agricultural credit programs wouldfully reflect the NBK-projected rates of inflation.&#13;
*  Farm Debt Overhang. Debt outstanding to the agricultural sector consists of: (i) debt to&#13;
Agroprombank (som 1,012 million); (ii) debt accumulated through government transfers for&#13;
agricultural credit (som 560 million); and (iii) an unknown amount of inter-enterprise debt.&#13;
Government has agreed that debt (i) would be recovered by DEBRA, a debt collection&#13;
agency established under the FINSAC operation, and debt (ii) would be recovered by&#13;
MAWR and RA. The debt amounts, in real value in 1997, are much less than the original&#13;
amounts due to high inflation. Government has established an inter-agency Task Force,&#13;
under the leadership of the First Prime Minister (Finance and Economy), to collect the debt&#13;
information data and recommend specific mechanisms fir dealing with the inter-enterprise&#13;
debt. It is understood that the Task Force 's report would be forwarded to IDA not later than&#13;
August 1, 1997. The Task Force's recommendations would be implemented, if found&#13;
acceptable by IDA.&#13;
3.28   Government Agricultural Credit Program. Increasing budget resources have been allocated to&#13;
the Government agricultural credit program since 1992. The budget allocation for agricultural credit in&#13;
1997 is planned to be som 150 million all of which is expected to come from loan recoveries from&#13;
budgetary credit of the previous years. These fund transfers have not been repaid and continue to&#13;
accumulate. In an environment of expanding budgetary allocations for commodity credit at negative&#13;
rates of interest, it would be almost impossible to develop and sustain a commercially viable rural credit&#13;
system, like the one proposed under this project. While a case could be made for providing financial&#13;
support to agriculture at this critical juncture of the transition, such support should be reduced and&#13;
eventually phased out. During appraisal, the following agreements were reached with the Government&#13;
and they were confirmed at negotiations: (a) Government will reduce and phase out its budgetary&#13;
allocations to the agricultural credit program on the following maximum benchmarks and schedule:&#13;
(i)1998: 50 million soms; (ii) 1999: 25 million soms; (iii) 2000: 0.0 million; (b) these budgetary transfers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
would be made by the Ministry of Finance to the Ministry of Agriculture early enough (August) to be&#13;
able to finance imports of critical farm inputs for use in winter and spring cultivation; (c) minimum on-&#13;
lending interest rates on these budgetary credit will be equal to KAFC's lending interest rates, except in&#13;
1997 when it will be 10 percent per annum; (d) MAWR, in collaboration with the RA, will be&#13;
responsible for recovering these loans; (e) MAWR and RA will prepare a complete list of borrowers with&#13;
overdue balances for budgetary credit and submit to KAFC such a list, and copies of the credit contracts&#13;
before negotiations; (f) loan recoveries made by MAWR and RA on budgetary loans made during 1992-&#13;
96 and 1997-99 will be transferred to KAFC as share capital contributions by the Government of the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic, unless otherwise agreed by the Association, (g) after 1998, KAFC will manage all&#13;
lending operations in each oblast using the recovered funds and, on a matching basis, its own funds; (h)&#13;
annual expansion in KAFC lending operations will be, at least, equal to two times the reduction in the&#13;
budgetary credit for agriculture during 1998-2000; and (i) MAWR and RA will establish eligibility&#13;
criteria for participation in the budgetary credit program.&#13;
3.29   Institutional Innovations. These would be implemented to ensure that KAFC develops quickly&#13;
into a cost conscious and reputable commercial credit agency, and to create a suitable legal framework&#13;
for the development of FSOs and RFIs. The following innovations would be implemented:&#13;
-  KAFC Institutional Innovations. These will include the following measures: (i) revision of&#13;
the KAFC Charter on the basis of the recommendations of the pre-appraisal mission (Annex&#13;
D); (ii) approval and adoption of an appropriate organizational and management structure for&#13;
KAFC (as described in Annex B) by the KAFC Board; (iii) approval and adoption of&#13;
appropriate operational policies and procedures for KAFC. It is understood that these&#13;
actions would be implemented by the Board of KAFC not later than October 31, 1997.&#13;
*  SFCOP Institutional Innovation. This would include the provision of satisfactory evidence&#13;
by KAFC of legal measures to support the establishment and operation of precooperatives&#13;
and cooperatives as providers of access to micro-credits or savings mobilization services is a&#13;
condition of disbursement for SFCOP.&#13;
D.    PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
3.30   Project Costs. Total costs over a three year period of the project are estimated at US$21.0&#13;
million (Table 3.1), including physical and price contingencies (except for lines of credit). The project&#13;
costs do not include taxes or duties as goods financed under the project would be exempt. Detailed cost&#13;
tables are in Appendix 1. Lines of credit account for 72 percent of total project costs. Technical&#13;
assistance costs would be US$2.4 million or approximately 11 percent of total project costs. Training&#13;
would account for US$1.1 million or 5 percent of total project costs. The relatively high shares of&#13;
technical assistance and training in total project costs reflects the severity of lack of local implementation&#13;
capacity and the need for implementation support and institution-building. The development of a&#13;
commercially sustainable rural finance system in the country would place high demand on commercial&#13;
management skills and technical knowledge, both of which are quite scarce in the country.&#13;

3.31   Financing Plan. The proposed sources of financing the project costs are summarized in Table&#13;
3.2. The proposed IDA Credit of US$16.0 million equivalent would finance 76 percent of total project&#13;
costs. The Credit would consist of US$15.0 million for lines of credit to KAFC and US$1.0 million to&#13;
finance TA for SFCOP and vehicles and equipment for KAFC. It was agreed during negotiations that&#13;
Government would seek bilateral grants to finance the SFCOP technical assistance and that, once such&#13;
grants are obtained, the proceeds of the IDA Credit thus made free would be made available to the&#13;
SFCOP line of credit by the Government on a grant basis. The Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC)&#13;
has provided a grant of about US$0.6 to cover KAFC technical assistance and training during the first&#13;
year. The European Union-TACIS would provide about US$2.0 million equivalent to finance KAFC and&#13;
SFCOP technical assistance and training. Government, KAFC and final beneficiaries would finance&#13;
US$2.4 million equivalent, or 11 percent of total project costs, mainly covering support for&#13;
administrative budgets of KAFC and SFCOP and contributions by final beneficiaries to sub-loans. An&#13;
IDA PPF, amounting to US$70,000, has been advanced to KAFC to purchase requisite computer&#13;
equipment and software and it would be refinanced upon Credit effectiveness.&#13;

E.    PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.32   KAFC management and the Department would be responsible for carrying out all procurement&#13;
and disbursements under their respective programs. KAFC would have capabilities for: (i) monitoring&#13;
procedures for procurement and disbursement; (ii) ensuring proper notification of bidding opportunities;&#13;
(iii) preparing specific bid documents based on the current Bank Standard Documents for goods and&#13;
works; (iv) preparing letters of invitation and terms of reference for consultants; (v) evaluating bids and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
proposals and preparing evaluation reports; and (vi) supervising contracts. The Department would&#13;
contract KAFC to carry out these functions.&#13;
3.33   Procurement Methods. Tables 3.3 summarizes the proposed procurement methods under the&#13;
project: (i) Goods: Bulk of the goods (valued US$15 million), are farm inputs, small equipment, spare-&#13;
parts, livestock breeding stock and agricultural produce under small loans (estimated not to exceed&#13;
US$2000 per loan) re-lent to farmers through two Agricultural Credit Institutions (KAFC and SFCOP).&#13;
The beneficiaries are therefore expected to carryout procurement using local commercial practices.&#13;
Office equipment and vehicle to the KAFC estimated to cost about US$100,000 will be procured&#13;
following shopping procedure; (ii) Consulting Services: three consulting service packages each estimated&#13;
to cost about US$250,000 will be procured following fixed budget method and few other contract&#13;
assignments estimated not exceeding US$50,000 per contract such as legal support, accounting, auditing,&#13;
will be procured in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines dated January 1997. Consulting&#13;
Services, financed by the EU-TACIS and Swiss funds, would be procured in accordance with the donor's&#13;
procedures; (iii) Training estimated to be about US$1.1 million, would consist of study tours and local&#13;
courses provided by local or foreign DEs. Training would be financed by EU-TACIS and Swiss funds&#13;
and would be procured in accordance with the donors' procedures; (iv) Support for Administrative&#13;
Budgets of KAFC and Department, consisting of incremental local staff salaries and allowances, utilities,&#13;
communication, vehicle and equipment operating and maintenance expenditures, would be procured in&#13;
accordance to KAFC operational manuals, approved by IDA.&#13;
3.34   Prior Review of Procurement Decisions by IDA. There would be no prior review of bidding&#13;
documents, bid evaluation and contract awards by IDA for goods, except for ICB. However, the&#13;
procurement documents would be kept for review by IDA supervision missions. For technical assistance&#13;
and training, contracts valued at US$100,000 and above for firms, and US$50,000 and above for&#13;
individuals or local firms would be subject to IDA's prior review. All terms of reference would be&#13;
subject to IDA's prior review.&#13;

start in September 1997. The disbursement schedule for the project is presented in Annex J and it&#13;
deviates from the disbursement profile of typical agricultural projects because over 72 percent of the&#13;
total project costs would be lines of credit which are expected to be quick-disbursing, given the demand&#13;
for short-term credit in the country.&#13;
3.36   The proposed credit of SDR 11.9 million (US$16.0 equivalent) would be disbursed against the&#13;
categories and at percentages indicated in para 3.37. Disbursements would be made against Statement of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs), except for (i) contracts for goods valued at more than US$50,000; (ii) contracts of&#13;
consultant firms valued at more than US$100,000; (iii) contracts of individual consultants or local firms&#13;
valued at more than US$50,000. The documentation of justification of withdrawals made under the&#13;
SOEs would be retained by both KAFC and the SFCOP Department, and these would be reviewed by&#13;
IDA supervision missions, as well as be subject to annual audits. To facilitate disbursements against&#13;
eligible expenditures, the Borrower would establish two special accounts in a commercial bank, selected&#13;
in consultation with NBK and the Ministry of Finance and Economy. The first account is to be operated&#13;
by KAFC , and the second by the SFCOP Department; both accounts would be operated under terms and&#13;
conditions satisfactory to the Association. IDA would make Authorized Allocations of US$1.0 million&#13;
and US$250,000 respectively.  Initially, the allocations would be limited to US$500,000 and&#13;
US$100,000 until disbursements had reached SDR3.0 million and SDR500,000, then the full Authorized&#13;
Allocation could be claimed. The KAFC and SFCOP would submit replenishment applications for&#13;
special account on a monthly basis, or when about 20 percent of the initial deposit has been utilized,&#13;
whichever comes first.  The replenishment applications would be supported by the necessary&#13;
documentation, bank statement of the special account, a reconciliation bank statement of the special&#13;
account against Bank records.&#13;
3.37   The disbursement percentages by category for the proposed IDA Credit (US$16.0 million) would&#13;
be as indicated below. It was agreed during negotiations that adherence to the terms and conditions&#13;
specified in the Lending Operational Manual will be a condition for disbursements of all subloans under&#13;
KAFC and SFCOP. (Disbursements of SFCOP subloans are subject to other conditions.)&#13;
Category                  Amount of the Credit       % of Expenditures&#13;
Allocated (S$)            to be Financed&#13;
(1)    Subloans:&#13;
(a) KAFC Component         13,000,000                 100% until December 31, 1998;&#13;
85% until December 31, 1999;&#13;
75% thereafter.&#13;
(b) SFCOP Component        2,000,000                  100%.&#13;
(2)    KAFC Goods                  100,000                  100% of foreign expenditures;&#13;
and 80% of local expenditures.&#13;
(3)    SFCOP Consultants           900,000                  100% of foreign expenditures;&#13;
and 80% of local expenditures.&#13;
(4)    Refunding of PPF             70,000&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
G.    PROJECT ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING&#13;
3.38   Project Accounting.  Both KAFC and Department would establish accounting and control&#13;
systems capable of reliably recording and reporting all financial transactions by various implementing&#13;
agencies. These systems would be in place before project expenditures begin. The Department would&#13;
contract KAFC to operate its accounting system. For the use of SOEs, both KAFC and the Department&#13;
would process and maintain SOE documentation to IDA's satisfaction. KAFC would use the FAO-&#13;
developed Microbanker as its primary accounting software. For the Special Accounts, the KAFC and the&#13;
Department would agree with the depository commercial bank(s) on the procedures for proper&#13;
accounting of receipts, payments and submission documentation to IDA for the replenishment of the&#13;
accounts.&#13;
3.39   Project Auditing. Annual accounts of the project, including SOEs and Special Accounts, would&#13;
be audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by independent auditors, acceptable&#13;
to IDA and they would also conform with the requirements of the NBK relating to financial institutions.&#13;
The various contractors under the SFCOP would also provide annual financial statements for contracts&#13;
under their implementation, and these would be audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing&#13;
standards by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The auditors would be appointed by the Board of&#13;
KAFC and the Department. The terms of reference for the auditors would conform to the Guidelines for&#13;
Financial Reporting and Auditing Projects Financed by the World Bank, of March 1982. The financial&#13;
statements and the auditors' opinions and reports would be submitted to IDA not later than six months&#13;
after completion of the fiscal year. The cost of retaining the auditors would be financed from the&#13;
proceeds of the IDA Credit and would be included as part of project costs. Auditors would also be&#13;
required to select randomly, at least, 10 percent of KAFC's active portfolio for management auditing.&#13;
H.    REPORTING AND MONITORING&#13;
3.40   Annex H contains the monitorable indicators for each project objective. The annual business&#13;
plan of KAFC and the annual work plans of the DEs would include sections detailing the targets and the&#13;
results that would be expected to be achieved at the end of each year. KAFC and the Department would&#13;
establish, on the basis of this information, monitoring and evaluation systems and follow up regularly the&#13;
progress achieved under the annual plans. The following year's business or work plan must explain any&#13;
discrepancy between the targets and the results obtained. The Department would recruit a Monitoring&#13;
and Evaluation Specialist for this purpose. In KAFC, the Financial Controller would be responsible for&#13;
this task. For the purpose of monitoring and evaluation, the management information system (MIS) for&#13;
KAFC and the Department would be focused on providing information on: (i) outreach indicators&#13;
consisting of number of clients, farm size, percentage of female clients, average loan size; and (ii) self-&#13;
sustainability indicators comprising on-lending rates, interest rate spread, loan recovery rates, loan&#13;
transaction costs, and level of savings mobilization. Both KAFC and the Department would prepare and&#13;
submit annual reports describing the progress achieved during the year on all aspects of the respective&#13;
components, problems encountered and changes introduced. Substantial changes must receive IDA's&#13;
approval before they are implemented. Annual reports would be submitted to IDA not later than March&#13;
31 of each year.&#13;
I.    MID-TERM REVIEW&#13;
3.41    An independent consultant together with an IDA supervision mission would carry out a Mid-&#13;
Term Review of the project at the middle of the second year of implementation. The review would focus&#13;
on progress made, take stock of experience gained in implementing the individual components of the&#13;
project, and evaluate problems associated with beneficiary participation in implementing project&#13;
activities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
IV. PROJIECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY&#13;
4.01   The KAFC and Department would be responsible for implementation of their respective&#13;
programs. In view of KAFC's initial limited institutional capacity and lack of lending experience, its&#13;
lending program would be restricted to short term credit during the first two years of operation. For the&#13;
same reasons, KAFC's lending volume would not exceed US$3.0 million equivalent in the first year of&#13;
operation. However, the latter could be expanded rapidly with excellent loan recovery performance and&#13;
increased staff recruitment and training after the first year of operation. The SFCOP Department would&#13;
contract the implementation of the SFCOP to eligible private sector agencies, including management&#13;
consulting firms and NGOs. In order to permit some flexibility to learn and eventually to lead to the&#13;
establishment of local financial intermediaries, SFCOP would be limited to the promotion of FSOs&#13;
which would be pre-cooperative organizations requiring less formality and permitting participants more&#13;
institutional choice in terms of the type of cooperative suitable for achieving their objectives. SFCOP&#13;
would also be implemented on an oblast-based phasing, beginning with two oblasts in the first year, to be&#13;
followed by two more oblasts each subsequent year until all six oblasts would be covered in the final&#13;
year of the project. To ensure beneficiary participation, the DE would promote the establishment of FSOs&#13;
in response to demand by farmer groups in areas covered by the program. The DE would explain to&#13;
farmers the different options for cooperative types, capable of meeting their objectives and leave the&#13;
participants to make the final choice. Implementation of the various project activities is summarized in&#13;
the Project Implementation Schedule (Appendix 2).&#13;
B.    KAFC LENDING PROGRAM MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.02   The Board of KAFC would be responsible for ensuring that the KAFC program is implemented&#13;
with due diligence and efficiency. KAFC's corporate and management structure and its operating policies&#13;
and procedures would be geared toward achieving these objectives. KAFC would implement its lending&#13;
program in accordance with its business plan, lending policies and procedures as agreed with IDA (para.&#13;
3.14). Initially, loan applications would be processed in the field offices by mobile credit officers and&#13;
then submitted to the head office for further review by senior loan officers and loan approval by the&#13;
Credit Committee or the Board. Approval limits would be established for the Loan Committee&#13;
(consisting of the Executive Director, Financial Controller, and Credit Manager) and loans exceeding the&#13;
established limit would be submitted to the Board or a Board Loan Committee. During the first year of&#13;
operation, loan approval authority would be centralized at the head office. However, in order to expedite&#13;
lending decisions, KAFC would consider decentralization and delegation of loan approval authority to&#13;
oblast or regional field offices (branches) in the second year, and establish branch approval limits for a&#13;
loan committee comprising the senior mobile credit officer (SMCO) in-charge of the oblast office and at&#13;
least two mobile credit officers (MCOs). Head office loan evaluators would exercise strict control over&#13;
branch loan approvals and carry out ex-post reviews of branch-approved loans. MCOs would have&#13;
authority to reject, for valid reasons, loan applications without referring them to their supervisors&#13;
(SMCOs) or higher authority. However, branch offices would maintain brief records of all rejected loan&#13;
applications, indicating the reasons for rejection. These records, as well as loan approvals, would also be&#13;
subject to inspection by SMCOs, the Credit Manager, and the Internal Auditor. Loan agreements and&#13;
other legal documents would be prepared in the head office and submitted to the branch offices for&#13;
signature by borrowers, which would also take place in the field in the course of visits by MCOs. Loan&#13;
disbursement instructions would be issued by MCOs and disbursements would, generally, be made&#13;
through transfer of loan funds to the account of the borrower in any depository institution, including the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
settlement system established by NBK. Loan repayments would either be made direct to KAFC head&#13;
office or branch office by the borrower or through the borrower's intermediary, or organization, if any.&#13;
C.    SFCOP MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
4.03   The institutional arrangement for implementing the SFCOP is fully described in Annex C and it&#13;
would comprise the Department, DEs, and FSOs. Each organization would have the following&#13;
implementation responsibilities.&#13;
4.04   The SFCOP Department. This entity, under the KAFC, would not be intended to operate as an&#13;
apex financial institution and it would be temporary. It would, however, carry out some of the functions&#13;
normally performed by apex financial organizations. Its functions would include: (i) managing the&#13;
financial resources allocated to the SFCOP by Government or donors; (ii) channeling the funds to the&#13;
DEs for lending to FSO members and for promotional activities (training); (iii) procuring of goods and&#13;
services, especially contracting DEs to implement specific oblast-based outreach programs under the&#13;
SFCOP; (iv) supervising and monitoring overall implementation of the SFCOP, (v) contracting the&#13;
carrying out of financial operations and loan accounting to KAFC; and (vi) preparing operational&#13;
manuals and guidelines for DEs and providing legal support (e.g., preparation of model by-laws and&#13;
drafting of new laws or decrees) required for the development of FSOs. The Department would allocate&#13;
funds to DEs on the basis of agreed annual work programs and budgets, specifying outreach and loan&#13;
recovery targets. The Department would, with KAFC assistance, carry out the financial operations (e.g.,&#13;
funds disbursements to and collection from DEs, and loan accounting ). Over time, the Department&#13;
could become KAFC's department specializing in lending to smaller farmers and agribusiness&#13;
enterprises.&#13;
4.05   The DEs. These would be local or foreign NGOs or consulting firms meeting the stipulated&#13;
criteria for participation (Box 6). As agents of the Department, the DEs would act a financial&#13;
intermediaries and promoters of FSOs and carry out the following tasks: (i) managing the financial&#13;
resources allocated to them by the Department; (ii) administering the credit funds obtained from the&#13;
Departmenw to FSO members in accordance with SFCOP guidelines; (iii) supervising and recovering&#13;
loans from FSO members and recycling the funds in accordance with Department directives; (iv)&#13;
carrying out training and promotional activities necessary for the development of FSOs and for the&#13;
transformation of FSOs into RFIs within two years: (v) maintaining accounts for all activities they are&#13;
contracted to carry out; (vi) liaise with local input suppliers and agricultural advisory service to promote&#13;
credit-technical development packages; and (vii) liaise with KAFC, ADB program, and other lenders on&#13;
FSO'- eligibility to participate in their respective programs. DEs would prepare annual work plans and&#13;
budgets with specific targets for outreach (number of FSOs, loan amounts, members to be trained) and&#13;
loan recoveries and recycles. These plans and budgets would be the basis for annual renewal of the&#13;
agency contracts and allocation of funds.&#13;
4.06   The FSOs. These would be the heart of program implementation. The success of the SFCOP&#13;
would depend on the farmers' response to the program and, more importantly, on the FSOs ability to&#13;
operate as cohesive groups providing sustainable access to credit for their members. The FSOs would&#13;
play a critical role in program implementation, including: (i) screening members' loan applications and&#13;
endorsing them for consideration by the DE; (ii) supervising the use of loan funds by individual&#13;
members; (iii) enforcing loan repayment by individual members; (iv) assuring the participation of&#13;
individual members in all FSO's activities, including training and meetings; and (v) maintaining accounts&#13;
related to member borrowings and repayments. FSO members' application would be based on a simple&#13;
application form (Annex F). A tripartite loan contract, signed by the DE, FSO, and the individual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
member (borrower) would be executed to seal the loan deal (Annex G). FSO members would repay their&#13;
loans either directly to the DE or through their FSO. FSOs with unsatisfactory loan repayment&#13;
performance (below 80 percent) would be forced to exit the program and their members would not be&#13;
allowed to regroup into a new FSO.&#13;
D.    PROJECT SUPERVISION&#13;
4.07   Project supervision would be closely linked to the project objectives and the annual&#13;
implementation plans for KAFC and SFCOP. It would involve monitoring a number of key indicators&#13;
(Annex H) and assessing both quality and quantity aspects of implementation and impact. KAFC&#13;
management and Department would have primary responsibility for supervising implementation of&#13;
project activities under their purview to assess field implementation progress and problems. IDA would&#13;
field at least two supervision missions every year which would focus key implementation issues, sort out&#13;
problems, assess benefits, and draw lessons, and provide advice and guidance to the management of&#13;
implementing agencies. The first IDA supervision mission would include a project launch workshop to&#13;
provide orientation and training for key staff in implementing agencies on the project objectives,&#13;
procurement and disbursement procedures, accounting and auditing requirements. Proposed experts on&#13;
supervision missions are presented in Annex 1.&#13;
E.    IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT&#13;
4.08   An implementation completion report would be prepared by an independent consultant,&#13;
employed by the borrower, no later than six months after the Closing Date of the credit. The report&#13;
would highlight the successes and problems encountered during project implementation and assess the&#13;
impact of the project to determine whether the project objectives were achieved.&#13;
F.    COORDINATION WITH OTHER MAJOR RELATED PROJECTS&#13;
4.09   The proposed project would have complementary interface with the following projects which are&#13;
under implementation or being planned in the agricultural sector:&#13;
4.10   Sheep Development Project (SDP). This project is currently under implementation and aims to&#13;
improve sheep and wool productivity, privatize the provision of marketing and extension services to&#13;
private farmers, and to improve the management and conservation of natural grazing resources. The&#13;
project focuses on organizing private sheep producers into farmers' association or groups through which&#13;
the services can be channeled and on developing competitive markets for lamb and wool in which&#13;
domestic and foreign buyers participate. The proposed RFP, through either KAFC or SFCOP, would&#13;
provide access to credit to private sheep producers adopting the new technologies under SDP. It would&#13;
also enable agribusiness enterprises participating in the trading of lamb and wool have easy access to&#13;
credit for working capital.&#13;
4.11  Agricultural Support Services Project (ASSP). This project is under preparation. It would focus&#13;
on improving the availability of new productivity-enhancing farm technologies and of technical&#13;
knowledge (advisory services) to private farmers. The adoption of new farm technologies by private&#13;
farmers would be accelerated by the availability of credit under the RFP.&#13;
4.12  Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (IRP)  This project, under preparation, would focus on&#13;
rehabilitating the main irrigation infrastructure (main canals and dams) to restore efficiency and provide&#13;
adequate water downstream. The availability of credit to private farmers through the RFP would provide&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
the necessary incentive for private farmers to adopt irrigation-intensive technologies and assure&#13;
satisfactory economic returns on the upstream investments under the IRP.&#13;
4.13   Pilot Demonstration Project (PDP)/Kyrgyz People's Initiative Project (KPIP).  The Pilot&#13;
Demonstration Project is currently under implementation and has provided a learning process on which the&#13;
proposed KPIP would be based. The PDP has successfully tested and demonstrated that (i) the rural poor&#13;
can be encouraged to organize themselves into viable self-help organizations; (ii) the poor and&#13;
disadvantaged households can, as a group, take advantage of opportunities to improve their financial and&#13;
social well-being. The proposed KPIP would pursue the same objectives as the PDP and it would remain&#13;
focused on the resource-poor farmers, on average cultivating less than 5 hectares under irrigation or&#13;
owning a small herd or flock of livestock. The SFCOP under the RFP would use similar mobilization&#13;
strategies that have proven effective under the PDP, but would focus on a relatively resource-richer target&#13;
group of farmers (cultivating 10-50 ha and already producing a surplus for the market). Ultimately, the&#13;
KPIP groups would be expected to "graduate" into FSOs and these, in turn, into RFIs. Thus the step-by -&#13;
step approach underpinning both KPIP and SFCOP would result into a complementary effort in the long&#13;
term, despite the difference in target groups between the two programs.&#13;
4.14 ADB's Credit Union Project. This project is being proposed by ADB for financing. It would&#13;
comprise the establishment of a Credit Union System (CUS) with an Apex Union initially to be wholly by&#13;
the Government and will gradually transfer ownership to credit unions and support for NBK to strengthen&#13;
its regulatory and supervisory capacity. The CUS program would involve the establishment of 280 credit&#13;
unions and an Apex Union over a six year period to provide savings and lending services and provides for&#13;
a credit line of about US$7.0 million to match share capital and savings of credit union members. The&#13;
performance of the three trial credit unions has experienced several "teething" problems, including slow&#13;
response by farmers to participate; lack of guidance and training; inadequate savings mobilization from&#13;
members; inadequate accounting practices; and weak local leadership. These have led to changes in the&#13;
project design. The CUS would thus aim to create formal cooperative organizations, characterized by a&#13;
group of members operating through a joint enterprise (i e, the cooperative enterprise) to access savings&#13;
and lending services. Credit unions would therefore be financial intermediaries right from the start. Under&#13;
the SFCOP, the initial emphasis would be to access credit through self-help and mutual assistance and trust&#13;
within the group without operating a joint or cooperative enterprise. The credit unions established under&#13;
the CUS program would be the last stage of development of individual FSOs under the SFCOP and would&#13;
not be promoted under the RFP. However, FSOs which mature enough to require the operation of a joint&#13;
enterprise within two years under the SFCOP, would be advised either to approach KAFC to have access to&#13;
its group lendingfacility or to apply to the Apex Union and NBK to be registered as members of the CUS.&#13;
Since both the CUS and SFCOP programs would be demand driven, it is unlikely that they would compete&#13;
for members, even within the same geographical outreach. Finally, KAFC's group lending facility would&#13;
be available to all eligible RFIs, including credit unions under the CUS Program.&#13;
4.15   Other Rural Credit Schemes. There are several donor and government-sponsored rural credit&#13;
schemes in the county. The major source of credit is the government credit program which channels&#13;
budgetary funds through the Rural Credit Cooperatives (RCC), established on the basis of a top-down&#13;
approach with little or no beneficiary participation. The RCCs, as indicated by the government failure to&#13;
recover its loans since 1992 (para. 3.28), have been a dismal failure. The RCCs are expected to play a&#13;
marginal role and disappear with the elimination of the government agricultural credit program at the end&#13;
of 1999 (para. 3.28). Donor-sponsored rural credit schemes play an insignificant role, in terms of the&#13;
overall credit supply and private farmer coverage. The major donor-sponsored credit schemes include&#13;
those operated by EU-TACIS, Mercy Corps, CARITAS, HELVETAS and GTZ and have a total of 4,100&#13;
participants to whom they lend less than US$1.5 million equivalent (seasonal credit only) per season. All&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
these lenders are charging negative interest rates (12 percent/year) and loan recovery on some schemes is&#13;
less than 60 percent. These distortions would initially affect lending under the RFP. However, both the&#13;
KAFC and SFCOP lending programs would be based on what has worked or is working in these various&#13;
credit programs and schemes. The "get-tough" and business-like attitude of KAFC and the DEs would&#13;
contrast with the less business-like attitude and "grant culture" associated with some of the donors and&#13;
NGOs involved in the rural credit schemes in the country. The PDP has actually demonstrated that&#13;
substantial pay-off, in terms of loan recoveries, can be associated with the former attitude.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
V.    PROJECT BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION, AND RISKS&#13;
A.    BENEFITS&#13;
5.01   The project would meet an urgent need to develop an efficient system of delivering credit to the&#13;
emerging private farming and agribusiness sectors.  The project would also attempt to create a&#13;
commercially sustainable system for providing financial services to the rural population in the longer&#13;
term. The project would complement and enhance the achievement of the CAS objectives (para 2.19) in&#13;
several ways. By providing access to credit to many private farmers and agribusiness enterprises, who&#13;
currently do not have such access, the project would enable such farmers and rural enterprises to make&#13;
use of the production and marketing opportunities that are being created by the government's programs&#13;
for economic liberalization, enterprise privatization, and farm restructuring. This access to credit would&#13;
lead to increased efficiency in farm production, agribusiness production and services. In particular, the&#13;
provision of credit to numerous rural agribusiness enterprises would enable them to participate in the&#13;
procurement of both farm inputs and products, and facilitate the development of rural competitive&#13;
markets which are currently lacking and are constraining both quality and quantity of production.&#13;
Increased and diversified farm and agribusiness production and value would therefore take place, with&#13;
substantial impact on rural incomes and poverty alleviation. The project would also serve as an effective&#13;
vehicle for deepening the ongoing government economic reform program and shortening the transition&#13;
period. For example, by providing access to credit to private small farmers, and by insisting on further&#13;
farm restructuring action plans as a credit conditionality for family association farms and collective or&#13;
state farms, the project would accelerate the pace of farm restructuring and privatization of farms.&#13;
5.02   The promotion and development of FSOs, as democratic organizations owned and run by&#13;
members, would have important implications for the process of political and economic decentralization&#13;
in the country. The local organizations would encourage political and economic empowerment of the&#13;
local communities. For a country undergoing a transition towards a democratic regime, the project's&#13;
contribution to political and social stability during the transition period cannot be over-emphasized&#13;
5.03   The project would establish the basis for creating a rural finance system to serve the rural&#13;
communities, including private farmers and rural agribusiness enterprises who are increasingly emerging&#13;
from the ongoing programs for economic restructuring. The project would use both foreign and local&#13;
private sector agencies, with government support and financing, to establish a private sector-oriented&#13;
rural finance system. Both KAFC and SFCOP would establish operating policies and procedures, and&#13;
banking skills necessary for investment lending and eventually produce a cadre of well-trained and&#13;
experienced rural finance specialists. These specialists could be employed and together with the&#13;
successful policies and procedures of KAFC and SFCOP, could be replicate by commercial banks for the&#13;
benefit of the entire banking sector in the country. Although the KAFC, Department, and DEs are&#13;
considered as temporary institutions, which would disappear with the cessation of government direct&#13;
support to the rural finance sector, they are expected to be converted into genuine private sector financial&#13;
institutions. KAFC and Department could eventually be merged and sold to the private sector (e.g., to&#13;
become the national apex organizations of all rural financial intermediaries). It is possible that some of&#13;
the DEs, being part of the private sector in their own right, could form the basis for horizontal and&#13;
vertical integration by the RFIs at oblast or regional level. In other words, they could become the nuclei&#13;
for the formation of regional RFIs.&#13;
5.04   Lending to private farmers under both the KAFC and SFCOP programs would be closely linked&#13;
to agricultural advisory services and agricultural marketing (especially input supply). Agricultural&#13;
advisory service, under the SDP and (later) ASSP, would provide private farmers with farm and financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
management skills in addition to production technology. Linking credit to trade of inputs and crops could&#13;
be an effective mechanism for minimizing the risk of default. All participants in this credit extension-&#13;
trade development package would emphasize proper use of credit, sound financial management, and&#13;
credit repayment discipline as conditions for continued access to institutional credit among borrowers.&#13;
5.05   The project would also assure that lenders would assess the environmental effects of sub-loans&#13;
and make their friendliness to the environment a necessary condition for financing. Farmers and&#13;
agribusiness enterprises would be required to abide with the environmental requirements prescribed by&#13;
the national environmental authority for agro-chemical management, soil conservation, irrigation&#13;
management, and agro-industrial affluent control.&#13;
5.06   The project would additionally have other externalities, including significant improvements in&#13;
rural financial market information and integration of financial markets in the long term. At present, the&#13;
existence of imperfect information and incomplete markets in the country's rural finance system account&#13;
for the extremely high cost of providing financial services to rural communities. The development of&#13;
close lender-borrower relationship between KAFC and farmers' organizations (local RFIs) and&#13;
agribusiness enterprises, and the establishment of FSOs, owned and operated by the community, would&#13;
lead to lenders (KAFC and DEs) knowing their customers (members of RFIs and FSOs) better and vice&#13;
versa. This would lead to improved market transparency and substantial reduction in information cost&#13;
(e.g., cost of loan screening) and risk management cost. This market transparency would attract other&#13;
lenders, like commercial banks, to lend to the rural sector from which they currently shy away because of&#13;
the perceived problems of imperfect information and high risk. This market integration would result in&#13;
increased lending to the rural sector and also optimal allocation of financial resources between the rural&#13;
sector and other sectors of the economy.&#13;
5.07   Finally, the project would have complementary effects on other investments being undertaken or&#13;
planned within the agricultural sector (paras. 4.09-4.15) by the Bank under its current CAS.  In some&#13;
cases ( for example, adoption of new technologies by farmers and agribusiness enterprises), optimal&#13;
returns on these investments would depend on the availability of credit.&#13;
B.    JUSTIFICATION&#13;
5.08   Credit Requirements. Despite increasing budget allocations (in nominal terms) by government&#13;
to the agricultural credit program since 1992 (paras. 3.27 and 3.28), the nascent private farming sector&#13;
has hardly benefited as these transfers have been targeted to the ex-state and collective farms. These&#13;
farms are virtually still under the command of the local authorities who continue to be responsible for the&#13;
credit fund distribution and it is not clear to what extent the funds even reached these farms.&#13;
Consequently, much of private farming in the country has had no access to credit to purchase seasonal&#13;
production inputs or capital equipment. Consumption of essential farm inputs, such as fertilizers,&#13;
agricultural chemicals, and veterinary medicines and drugs has substantially contracted. As a result, farm&#13;
production, productivity and profitability for both major crops and livestock have dramatically fallen&#13;
since 1992, except for wheat, potatoes, and vegetables in the last two years. Estimating demand for&#13;
agricultural credit in an economy undergoing a unique transition like the Kyrgyz Republic and where the&#13;
concept of credit has been highly distorted is a daunting exercise. However, using farm data, the cash&#13;
outlays (requirement) for producing the major crops and livestock among private farms the cash&#13;
requirements of the farming sector were estimated. used as a proxy for credit needs. Applying two&#13;
generally used rules of thumb, the amount of credit requirement (not demand) of the farming sector was&#13;
estimated. The rules of thumb, commonly used in estimating credit requirements are (i) agricultural&#13;
sector's credit requirement in a given production period normally represent 10 percent of the sector's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
GDP, and (ii) agricultural sector's credit requirements generally amount to 50 percent of the total&#13;
production cash requirement of the sector for a given production season. The resulting credit&#13;
requirements are summarized in Table 5.1. These results indicate that credit requirements are well above&#13;
the Government's budgetary transfers to the sector in the past. They are simply serve to indicate the&#13;
uncertainty associated with any attempt to estimate the demand for credit in the country.&#13;
5.09   Similarly, estimating credit demand by agribusiness enterprises is equally difficult. The ADB&#13;
survey (1996) estimated the demand for working capital and longer term investments at US$30.0 million.&#13;
A study on agribusiness financing requirements done during the preparation of this project revealed that&#13;
both working capital and investment finance were critical to the restart and rehabilitation of existing&#13;
privatized agribusiness enterprises. Entry onto input supply and farm product markets is being&#13;
effectively hindered by lack of access to working capital credit by new private agribusiness enterprises.&#13;
As a result, the anticipated recovery in the agribusiness sector is not materializing following the massive&#13;
privatization effort in the sector. Indeed production of processed food has consistently fallen since 1990&#13;
and in general production in 1996 was less than one-third of 1990. Access to working capital among&#13;
agribusiness enterprises would restart the recovery in the sector and make both farm markets and&#13;
agribusiness product markets more competitive and efficient. These developments would have positive&#13;
income and employment effects in the medium term.&#13;

1997                                              1,212         67.3&#13;
1998                                              1,334         74.1&#13;
1999                                             1,467          81.5&#13;
5.10   Farmers' Financial Returns. Several recent farm studies, including the Farm Profitability&#13;
Assessment Study (September, 1996) and the crop and livestock budgets prepared during the preparation&#13;
of this project, indicate that the Kyrgyz Republic has comparative advantage in the production of its&#13;
major commodities. These include wheat, maize, potatoes, cotton, wool, and dairy cattle. Although&#13;
farmgate prices for most of these commodities are still well below international parity prices, farmers'&#13;
profitability in the production of these commodities has been generally improving and this improvement&#13;
is likely to remain strong in the near future as local markets become more competitive during the&#13;
implementation of this project. Mixed farming, consisting of crop and livestock production, is widely&#13;
practiced in the country, except at higher mountain elevations (e.g., most of Naryn Oblast) where sheep&#13;
farming is predominant.   This mixed farming system  gives private farmers reasonable risk&#13;
diversification, balanced cash flow, and flexibility in responding to changes in market signals.&#13;
5.11   To illustrate the financial impact of the project on farm profitability, financial rates of return&#13;
(IRRs) were estimated for four farm models which are considered to be representative of the farming&#13;
system and cropping patterns in the country. The "without" situation is represented by the current&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
production structure in the representative private farms, in terms of yields and cost structure which face a&#13;
critical credit supply constraint. As a result of this constraint, inadequate working capital results in&#13;
underutilization of available land and in non-optimal adoption of inputs packages, or no use of modern&#13;
inputs. Under these circumstances, for example, farmers choose to use fertilizers alone without&#13;
weedicides in the production of wheat or grains. These decisions by farmers affect both yields and&#13;
production. The "with" situation postulates adequate availability of working capital through credit. This&#13;
enables framers to make full use of the available land and to adopt optimal inputs packages in line with&#13;
technical recommendations. Also, through increased competition and efficiency in the input delivery&#13;
system under the project, input prices would decline by about 15 percent. To fully depict the magnitude&#13;
of the impact of credit availability on farm profitability, IRRs for both "without" and "with" cases were&#13;
estimated and are presented in Appendix 4. IRRs based on incremental costs and benefit streams do not&#13;
reveal fully the magnitude of change, or the "quantum leap" between the two situations. The quantitative&#13;
assumptions underlying the IRR estimates are presented in Appendix 3. The private farm models used in&#13;
the estimation of IRR would be the principal beneficiaries of the project. Tobacco, which is a major crop&#13;
in the southern regions of the country, has not been included in the estimates because its production&#13;
would not be supported under the project (para. 5.23).&#13;
5.12   Table 5.2 summarizes the results of the monthly IRR analysis. It is evident that the project,&#13;
mainly through making credit available to various private farms at reasonable cost, would lead to&#13;
substantial improvements in farm profitability. It is also evident that the income effect and poverty&#13;
alleviation effect of the project at farm level would be considerable. The IRRs for all farms would be&#13;
particularly sensitive to increase in both inputs and product prices.  Given these levels of farm&#13;
profitability, the project risks (para. 5.17) may be more apparent than real. Such profitability is likely to&#13;
provide adequate incentive to reduce or overcome some of the project risks.&#13;

5.13   No estimation of the project's financial impact on agribusiness enterprises has been performed.&#13;
This is due to the extremely short maturity and diversity of the bulk of the sub-loans to agribusiness&#13;
enterprises. KAFC would provide working capital primarily to finance raw materials and spare parts&#13;
during the first two years of operation. These sub-loans would be made if they demonstrate satisfactory&#13;
financial viability as measured by debt service coverage ratio.&#13;
C.    SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
5.14   The project would be implemented, to a large extent, by private sector agencies (DEs, and FSOs)&#13;
and commercially-oriented public institutions (KAFC and Department) with government support and&#13;
initial funding. Once established, both types of institutions would generally be able to operate on a&#13;
sustainable basis. Despite the presence of externalities, asymmetric information, incomplete markets,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
and the project's focus on poverty reduction, the rural finance system would be developed on a cost&#13;
recovery basis, except for the initial costs of technical assistance and training.  All financial&#13;
intermediaries participating in the project would charge interest rates that would be positive in real terms&#13;
and cover the cost of funds. The productivity and financial gains generated by the project would provide&#13;
incentives for the farmers' organizations and the KAFC to consolidate and expand their newly acquired&#13;
assets and roles. As the farmers' organizations develop into financially strong intermediaries, it is likely&#13;
that they would begin to integrate vertically into an apex financial institution. They could do so by&#13;
buying out any remaining government ownership in KAFC. The Department, once it has successfully&#13;
realized its mandate, could be converted into a department specializing in lending to small farmers and&#13;
agribusiness enterprises. The sustainability of the DEs, which would be private sector agencies, would&#13;
be governed by their responses to market changes and their ability to remain competitive. Some of the&#13;
DEs could be transformed into regional financial intermediaries, exclusively owned by local farmers'&#13;
organizations and rural agribusiness enterprises.&#13;
D.    IMPACT ON POVERTY&#13;
5.15   The project's SFCOP would directly target the poor farm households at, or slightly above the&#13;
poverty line. This segment of the poor has been increasing and accounting for the rise in the proportion&#13;
of households below the poverty line (para. 1.06). Most of the rural poor are "temporarily poor" because&#13;
they have two assets which are critical to agricultural production: land and labor. Access to credit would&#13;
enable farm households to make full use of these primary resources and increase their production and&#13;
incomes. The farm cash flows and financial rates of returns estimated above show that increases in both&#13;
production and incomes would be substantial (Table 5.2). By helping this segment of the poor to increase&#13;
both their cash incomes and food security through increased farm productivity and production, the&#13;
project would effectively reduce the proportion of households below the poverty line. It would also help&#13;
reduce the poverty gap, which doubled during 1993-1996. By financing agribusiness enterprises,&#13;
production and employment in the sector would increase and, at the same time, farm product markets&#13;
would become more competitive, creating remunerative market opportunities for farmers.&#13;
E.    FISCAL IMPACT&#13;
5.16   The impact of the project on the government budget would be positive in the long term. During&#13;
the first year of operation, Government would be required to allocate about som 7.4 million as share&#13;
capital contribution for KAFC and som 250,000 for the Department administrative budget. If, however,&#13;
MAWR and RA would be able to collect a large share of the outstanding debt from farmers, government&#13;
contributions to KAFC and the Department would be funded by these collections. This would eliminate&#13;
the traditional dependence of agricultural lending on the government budget. Subsequent government&#13;
contributions to the share capital of KAFC would be through proceeds of the proposed IDA Credit (para.&#13;
3.07). After 1999, the government agricultural credit program, which has been a major drain on the&#13;
budget, would be phased out. Lending to agriculture under the project would largely be financed outside&#13;
the budget, mainly through donor funds, domestic commercial borrowing by KAFC, and credit reflows.&#13;
F.    RISKS&#13;
5.17   The project has high risks. The major risks consist of: (i) institutional innovations, (ii) fragility&#13;
of farm profitability inherent in a nascent private farming sector under transition; (iii) political&#13;
interference; (iv) continuation of the Government agricultural support program; and (v) unwillingness to&#13;
repay by borrowers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
5.18   Risks of Institutional Innovations. All local institutions and staff involved in implementing the&#13;
project would be new and they would adopt credit delivery mechanisms which are yet to be proven under&#13;
Kyrgyz conditions. These risks would be minimized by: (i) employing experienced technical assistance&#13;
from the private sector to manage the key institutions (KAFC and DEs); (ii) emphasizing practical&#13;
training for staff and members of key institutions; and (iii) adopting an implementation strategy that&#13;
limits the project scope, decentralizes project implementation, and provides for continuous feedback and&#13;
adjustment (para.. 4.01).&#13;
5.19   Fragile Farm Profitability. Private farming is still a transitional phenomenon in the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic. Profitability of most commodities in private farms is still generally depressed by market&#13;
failures inherent in the transition process. There has been, however, some remarkable recovery in the&#13;
profitability of wheat, potatoes, and vegetables in 1996. But, even this is still extremely fragile. A more&#13;
widespread and robust recovery in farm profitability would be necessary for ensuring demand for credit&#13;
and minimizing the risk of defaults by borrowers.  This would require extensive adoption of&#13;
productivity-enhancing technologies by farmers and the development of competitive domestic markets.&#13;
The project would assist farmers in this adoption process and it would also assist agribusiness enterprises&#13;
to participate more actively in farm product and inputs markets to enhance competition.&#13;
5.20   Political Interference. Government support and funding to the project could engender the risk&#13;
of political interference. KAFC, in particular, could be under political pressure to expand its lending&#13;
operations beyond its management capacity and thus compromise its autonomy and prudential&#13;
management.  To mitigate this risk, provisions have been made in its charter for private sector&#13;
representation on KAFC Board and for a strong and capable management team right from its inception.&#13;
In addition, the Board would be expected to honor its commitment to oversee the implementation of&#13;
KAFC's approved corporate plan, lending policies, and procedures.&#13;
5.21   Government Agricultural Support Program.  Continuation of the Government agricultural&#13;
credit program, even after reaching agreement on the rationalization measures (para. 3.28), would&#13;
constitute a major risk to the viability of KAFC. The Government might have no political muscle to&#13;
implement and enforce the agreed measures. In addition, until the Government acts decisively and&#13;
resolutely in enforcing the agreed measures, borrowers would expect the continuation of the credit non-&#13;
repayment culture nurtured by Agroprombank and the Government credit programs. In the event of this&#13;
risk becoming eminent, KAFC would take extra measures to increase its institutional capacity to expand&#13;
its lending operations to enable Government to channel its agricultural support through it and thereby&#13;
eliminate a separate subsidized Government credit program.&#13;
5.22   Unwillingness to Pay by Borrowers. The legacy of Agroprombank and Government credit&#13;
program has nurtured a credit non-repayment culture even when borrowers have the ability to repay. This&#13;
will haunt KAFC and SFCOP. The likelihood of this happening would be minimized by the "get-tough"&#13;
and business-like approach and refusal to forgive debt to be adopted by both KAFC and SFCOP. In&#13;
addition, collective responsibility for loan screening and loan repayment enforcement should gradually&#13;
prove effective, particularly for SFCOP, in getting borrowers to repay.&#13;
G.    ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
5.23   The environmental impact of the project would be negligible.  The potentially adverse&#13;
environmental impact resulting from the use of agricultural chemicals and fertilizers would, however, be&#13;
reduced by the use modern application methods, better equipment, and training in application and&#13;
equipment use by the extension staff. The liberalization of prices for fertilizers and chemicals has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
resulted in higher prices which are forcing farmers to cut down on wastage and to adhere to&#13;
recommended application rates. To minimize any potentially adverse environmental impact, the Bank's&#13;
guidelines on pesticide use would be followed. Agribusiness sub-projects would be required to satisfy&#13;
environmental criteria to be eligible for consideration. In accordance with Bank policy, the project&#13;
would not directly support the production and marketing of tobacco.  In order to assess the&#13;
environmental impact of sub-loans to farmers and agribusiness enterprises (i) guidelines for&#13;
environmental screening, and (ii) basic training in environmental screening to staff in the rural financial&#13;
intermediaries will be provided. This project has been rated Category "B".&#13;

            The Rural Finance Project has two
            primary objectives: 1) in the short-term, it will establish
            an interim institutional arrangement for lending to the
            agricultural and agribusiness sectors which presently have
            no access to commercial bank credit; and 2) in the medium
            and long-term, it will provide the basis for developing
            community-based financial services for the rural population.
            The project is comprised of the following components: (i)
            Kyrgyz Agricultural Finance Corporation (KAFC) line of
            credit; (ii) Small Farmers' Credit Outreach Program
            (SFCOP) line of credit; (iii) KAFC technical assistance;
            (iv) SFCOP technical assistance; (v) training for KAFC and
            SFCOP; and (vi) support for administrative budgets.
