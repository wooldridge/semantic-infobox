This review examines World Bank support to social safety nets between FY07-FY13,&#13;
including both financing and knowledge services. During this time period World Bank&#13;
financing for safety nets totaled just over US$ 12 billion, 273 financing activities in 93&#13;
Countries, the World Bank spent approximately US$118 million on 281 safety net studies&#13;
and supported approximately 129 credible safety net impact evaluations covering in 24&#13;
countries. Among the 93 countries represented in the portfolio, 42 received little or no&#13;
safety net support from the World Bank prior to Fiscal Year 2007. The growth in Bank&#13;
support is especially notable during the period of the food, fuel, and financial crises. The&#13;
analysis delves into these trends by region, type of intervention and instruments involved.&#13;
Finally, it delineates implications and outlook for the future based on lessons learned,&#13;
results measured and evaluative evidence.&#13;

&amp;#12;    I.     Introduction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Social safety nets have become a highly visible part of the global development agenda. With&#13;
growing evidence base on their positive impact â&#128;&#147; from both low- and middle-income&#13;
countries â&#128;&#147; there has been an explosion of interest in the design and implementation of&#13;
safety net programs in recent years. Adding to the flagship examples such as Mexico, Brazil,&#13;
Ethiopia, and Bangladesh, there is a new generation of countries emerging with robust&#13;
safety net systems including Niger, Cameroun, Rwanda, and Pakistan. The aspirations of&#13;
individual countries are reflected by with growing calls at the global level for social&#13;
protection to be featured on the post-2015 development agenda.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Against this dynamic backdrop, this review aims to examine World Bank support to social&#13;
safety nets between FY07-FY13, including both financing and knowledge services. The&#13;
review will examine the entire portfolio, drawing on the considerable amount of data and&#13;
literature that has been generated in recent years. The analysis will pay particular attention&#13;
to shifts in the portfolio, including any change in: (i) support for safety nets in low- and&#13;
middle-income countries within regions; (ii) the most common types of safety net&#13;
interventions used; and (iii) the results achieved in various settings. The analysis builds on a&#13;
previous portfolio review entitled Social Safety Nets in World Bank Lending and Analytical&#13;
Work: FY2002-2007,1 which provided a strong comparative baseline for how World Bank&#13;
support for social safety nets has recently evolved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The analysis confirms a surge of interest among developing countries in social safety net&#13;
support from the World Bank, particularly around the time of the food, fuel, and financial&#13;
(FFF) crises of FY09-11). The bulk of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s increased financing commitments were&#13;
made to middle-income countries that already had social safety nets in place, while the&#13;
number of new commitments has been highest in IDA countries that have only limited&#13;

&amp;#12;safety net provision in place. Significantly, the review highlights a recent convergence in the&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s provision of support to low-income and middle-income support for safety net&#13;
activities worldwide.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The analysis also highlights the importance of knowledge services within the portfolio. In&#13;
recent years, the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s analytical work has shifted from stand-alone reports to a more&#13;
programmatic approach in which diverse and tailor-made technical assistance is provided to&#13;
partner countries, often leading to subsequent financing for country operations. A hallmark&#13;
of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s work on knowledge services has been to facilitate the sharing of information,&#13;
best practices, and lessons learned between different countries, which have created a&#13;
vibrant community of global safety net practitioners worldwide. It is notable that safety net&#13;
projects tend to perform better, on average, than the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s portfolio as a whole. A&#13;
wealth of recent impact evaluation studies have shown that safety nets have had a direct&#13;
and significant effect in reducing poverty and narrowing inequality while also improving&#13;
other developmental outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This report highlights the progress that has been made in t he Bankâ&#128;&#153;s provision of support&#13;
for safety nets. It finds that the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s growing safety nets portfolio is adjusting to&#13;
different country scenarios and is increasingly moving towards building systems rather than&#13;
supporting individual programs. The Bank is also moving towards a pro-cyclical financing&#13;
model, in which support for safety nets continues beyond periods of crisis, while continuing&#13;
to focus on addressing the needs of those in the bottom 40 percent of the income&#13;
distribution. There is a strong evidence base charting the success and impact of Bank-&#13;
supported safety net programs in a diverse range of settings, including low income and&#13;
fragile settings. This evidence base is helping to improve the administration of safety net&#13;
programs and to codify knowledge on key program processes such as enrollment,&#13;
registration, verification, and monitoring and evaluation. A key lesson from many&#13;
operations is the importance of strong political leadership and governance to sustain such&#13;
advances.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              8&#13;
&amp;#12;At the same time, the review highlights a range of challenges. While the World Bank&#13;
business model in safety nets has clearly expanded in recent years, what are its limits in&#13;
terms of country coverage? As the World Bank sharpens its focus on poverty reduction and&#13;
shared prosperity, will safety net operations require greater selectivity? How can safety&#13;
nets maintain their flexibility to respond to shocks and crisis, whilest also moving towards a&#13;
longer terms systems approach. Given its retrospective nature, it is beyond the scope of this&#13;
paper to fully address these challenges, but it is expected that the analysis will increase&#13;
global knowledge and inform debate on safety nets and on the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s support for them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
II.        Context&#13;
Over the last decade, World Bank support for safety nets can most vividly be seen in&#13;
financing levels, which have been consistently high with growing regional diversification&#13;
(see Figure 1). This review focuses particularly on the period between 2007 and 2013, a&#13;
period that was dramatically shaped by events related to the global economic crisis. In&#13;
particular the fuel, food, and financial crises highlighted the importance of well-designed&#13;
social safety nets for reducing poverty and vulnerability and precipitated a wave of interest&#13;
in introducing safety nets, especially in IDA countries.2&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                  Figure 1: World Bank Financing for Safety Nets, FY02-13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In this broad context, the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s support for safety nets has evolved in a positive direction&#13;
towards becoming more integrated and programmatic. In recent years the Bank has begun&#13;
moving from a project-focused approach that emphasized delivery of social assistance&#13;
benefits to an approach that focuses on helping countries to build safety net systems and&#13;
institutions to respond better to poverty, risk, and vulnerability. Stronger demand for safety&#13;
net support in middle-income countries (MICs) in the past led to the Bank being significantly&#13;
more involved in other countries than in low-income countries (LICs). The recent global&#13;
crisis caused the Bank to expand its support into 42 new countries, many of which are LICs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s support to safety nets has consisted of both financing and knowledge sharing. At&#13;
present, the World Bank has an active portfolio in 122 countries and regions, in 57 of which&#13;
it is providing both financing and knowledge services, in 34 of which it is providing&#13;
knowledge services alone, and in 31 of which it is providing just financing. As an increasing&#13;
number of governments look to build safety net systems, they are often faced hard choices&#13;
about the type, affordability, and sustainability of social protection initiatives, particularly&#13;
those in fragile states. By supporting both lending and grant operations, the Bank has been&#13;
able to give countries flexibility and has provided them with predictable funding within a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              10&#13;
&amp;#12;long-term planning framework. Central to this support has been the dissemination and&#13;
sharing of knowledge through technical assistance, training, and south-south learning&#13;
events. In this context, trust funds have become an increasingly important part of the&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s financing services, catalyzing both policy dialogue and support in low-income&#13;
settings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s strong engagement in the area of safety nets is reflected in the key findings of&#13;
the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Independent Evaluation Groupâ&#128;&#153;s Evaluation on Safety Nets in 2010. It was&#13;
also an important component of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s recent Social Protection and Labor Strategy&#13;
2012-2022, which signaled an important shift towards integrating safety nets within the&#13;
broader social protection system to respond to country-level poverty, risks, and&#13;
vulnerabilities.3 The strategy aims to build sustainable and affordable safety nets in each&#13;
developing country while enabling them to invest in their human capital, thus increasing&#13;
their resilience, productivity, and their ability to access jobs and take advantage of&#13;
opportunities. With this aim in mind, the World Bank is developing country-specific tools&#13;
and approaches, investing in knowledge, data, and analysis, providing rapid-reaction policy&#13;
advice, and undertaking continuous technical assistance and capacity-building. In particular,&#13;
the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Rapid Social Response program is helping low-income countries to build social&#13;
protection systems that will protect their people during future crises. The Bank also&#13;
supports a diverse set of safety net interventions, ranging from cash transfers to labor-&#13;
intensive public works to school feeding programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Finally, it should be noted that the current review builds on a previous analysis of the safety&#13;
nets portfolio conducted during the time period 2002-2007.4 Because the previous study&#13;
used comparable data and methodology to the current review, it provides a useful&#13;
benchmark against which to assess what progress the Bank has made on safety nets since&#13;
then. Box 1 highlights the key findings of the previous review.&#13;

Grosh and Milazzo (2008) identified a portfolio of 145 operations with active safety net&#13;
components during the 2002-2007 period. The value of these components was US$3.4&#13;
billion dollars. Nine percent of all World Bank projects in those five years included safety&#13;
nets, though these were usually a small share of the overall loan. Limited comparisons with&#13;
a previous portfolio showed that there had been a larger number of loans in every year&#13;
from FY98, the year before the social risk management framework that underlies the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Social Protection and Labor Strategy was written. The size of the portfolio varied at different&#13;
times as it was expanded when large or multiple countries were faced with economic crises.&#13;
The share of the safety nets portfolio between IDA and IBRD countries was about the same&#13;
as for the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s overall portfolio. The safety nets portfolio was dominated by Latin America&#13;
and the Caribbean both in terms of the number of projects and of dollars.&#13;
&#13;
The portfolio was nearly evenly divided between cash programs, various types of non-cash&#13;
programs, public works, and technical assistance in that order, with much smaller amounts&#13;
going to micro-finance, â&#128;&#156;other,â&#128;&#157; and food-related projects. Despite the ubiquitous&#13;
appearance of the conditional cash transfer (CCT) in the literature at that time, the CCT&#13;
portfolio was fairly small. The most common theme in analytical work on safety nets was&#13;
cash transfers, with non-cash programs running second, and public works a distant third. A&#13;
hallmark of the portfolio was the existence of a large number of credible impact evaluations&#13;
of the main interventions, especially conditional cash transfers and public works programs.&#13;
&#13;
The assessment of current trends, country needs, and other factors suggested that the&#13;
portfolio would continue to be active going forward, with a greater balance among the&#13;
regions. The following areas were projected to be the main focus of the future portfolio:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ Implementing safety nets in the low-income countries of South Asia and Sub-Saharan&#13;
  Africa&#13;
â&#128;¢ Lending for CCTs in more countries&#13;
â&#128;¢ Continuing to support institutional issues (such as targeting, decentralization, and&#13;
  improved service delivery), particularly in middle-income countries&#13;
â&#128;¢ Addressing policy issues throughout the portfolio, particularly how safety nets fit into the&#13;
  poverty reduction and social policies of each country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;III.       Methodology of the Portfolio Review&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Definitions and Key Terms&#13;
&#13;
This report defines social safety nets (SSNs) as non-contributory transfer programs that&#13;
target the poor and vulnerable. They are also referred to as social assistance or social&#13;
welfare in some countries. In most countries, safety nets operate within a broader poverty&#13;
reduction strategy that also includes social insurance, health, education, and financial&#13;
services, the provision of utilities and roads, and other policies aimed at reducing poverty&#13;
and managing risk. SSNs play four major roles: (i) redistributing income to reduce poverty&#13;
and inequality; (ii) enabling better human capital investments: (iii) helping households to&#13;
manage risk: and (iv) offering social protection to those negatively affected by government&#13;
reforms aimed at increasing efficiency and growth.5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The safety net programs listed in the inventory in Table 1 follow the same categories as&#13;
used by Grosh and Milazzo (2008), which are cash transfers (both means-tested and&#13;
categorical), non-cash (in-kind) transfers (including food or energy price subsidies for&#13;
households), and others (including public work schemes and microcredit). This review adds&#13;
several categories of technical assistance because of the surge in this type of work in recent&#13;
years.&#13;

&#13;
The first group, cash programs, consists of programs that provide recipients with transfers&#13;
in cash targeted either by means (needs-based income support programs) or by category of&#13;
recipient (such as child allowances, non-contributory pensions for the elderly, and disability&#13;
benefits). It also includes conditional cash transfers (CCTs), which have become increasingly&#13;
popular since they were first found to be effective in Latin America. CCTs aim to reduce&#13;
poverty in the short term by providing cash transfers and in the longer term by making the&#13;
receipt of the transfers conditional on the recipients making investments in their human&#13;
capital (for example, by requiring them to make use of education and health facilities).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The non-cash category includes food-based programs (such as school feeding, maternal&#13;
child supplements, and food rations), training opportunities for beneficiaries (for example,&#13;
basic life skills training or vocational skills training), fee waivers or subsidies for health and&#13;
education services, and price subsidies for energy or housing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                14&#13;
&amp;#12;The third set of interventions consists of public works, micro-credit, and other income-&#13;
generating activities. Public works are the most important SSN intervention within this&#13;
category. Public works typically provides low-skilled employment opportunities (for&#13;
example, constructing or rehabilitating much-needed public infrastructure) to the poor who&#13;
are willing to work for a low wage paid either in cash or in kind. This category also includes&#13;
micro-credit programs and support for small-scale income-generating activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The final group of interventions aims to build capacity and improve institutions. Their&#13;
purpose is to strengthen the institutional capacity of key government agencies to improve&#13;
the administration, coverage, and targeting of social safety net programs. Some other&#13;
interventions in this category aim to encourage the development of a harmonized social&#13;
safety net system within a given country. In this area, the Bank often monitors or carries out&#13;
performance evaluations of the main social sector programs for the client country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank has defined social protection as systems, policies, and programs that aim to&#13;
promote resilience, enhance equity, and build opportunities for all (World Bank, 2012a)&#13;
Social protection directly increases resilience by helping people to insure themselves against&#13;
any deterioration in their well-being as a result of different types of shocks and improves&#13;
equity by reducing poverty and destitution and promoting equality of opportunity. Social&#13;
protection also promotes opportunity by building human capital, assets, and access to jobs&#13;
and by freeing families to make productive investments because of their greater sense of&#13;
security. Through this assistance, social protection aims to contribute to poverty reduction&#13;
and equitable growth, specifically by focusing on: (i) protection to ensure adequate support&#13;
to the poor; (ii) prevention to provide security to vulnerable people; and (iii) promotion to&#13;
increase the chances for them to raise their productivity and their incomes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank defines â&#128;&#156;low-incomeâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;middle-incomeâ&#128;&#157; countries as those countries that are&#13;
eligible to borrow from the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s International Development Association (IDA) or&#13;
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) respectively. (They will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             15&#13;
&amp;#12;henceforth be referred to in this report as IDA and IBRD countries.) As of July 1, 2013, low-&#13;
income economies are those that had per capita GNI of US$1,035 or less in 2012, with&#13;
exceptions for countries that have recently emerged from conflict or are small island&#13;
economies. IBRD countries are divided into lower-middle-income economies with a per&#13;
capita GNI of US$1,036 to US$4,085 and upper-middle-income economies with per capita&#13;
GNI of US$4,086 to US$12,615. This report defines â&#128;&#156;fragile situationsâ&#128;&#157; as those countries&#13;
that have an average institutional rating of 3.2 or less on the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Country Policy and&#13;
Institutional Assessment (CPIA) or that have had a United Nations (UN) and/or regional&#13;
peaceâ&#128;&#144;keeping or peaceâ&#128;&#144;building mission in their soil during the previous three years. During&#13;
FY12, 33 countries worldwide were recognized by the Bank as being fragile and&#13;
conflictâ&#128;&#144;affected, 19 of which were in Africa. Of these 33, with the exception of Iraq and the&#13;
West Bank and Gaza, all were also IDAâ&#128;&#144;eligible countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Financing services refers to the mix of loans, credits, and grants that the World Bank&#13;
provides to member countries in order to meet their development challenges. The three&#13;
main financing instruments include: (i) investment project financing; (ii) development policy&#13;
lending; and (iii) program-for-results operations. Investment projects provide funding (in&#13;
the form of IBRD loans or IDA credits and grants) to governments to cover specific&#13;
expenditures related to economic and social development projects.6 Development policy&#13;
operations provide budget support to governments for policy and institutional reforms&#13;
aimed at achieving a set of specific development results. Program-for-results operations&#13;
(P4R) support the performance of government programs by strengthening institutions and&#13;
building capacity and by linking the disbursement of funds directly to the delivery of defined&#13;
results. In addition to these three kinds of financing services, the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s support for&#13;
member countries also comes in the form of trust funds/grants, which are accounted for&#13;
separately from the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s own resources. Trust funds are financial and administrative&#13;
arrangements that the World Bank has with an external donor that provide countries with&#13;
&#13;
6&#13;
 Over the past two decades, investment operations have made up about 75 to 80 percent of the Bank's&#13;
portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   16&#13;
&amp;#12;grants, credits, loans, or guarantees for high-priority development needs, such as technical&#13;
assistance, advisory services, debt relief, post-conflict transition, and co-financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Knowledge services refer to the non-lending segment of World Bank support, which usually&#13;
takes the form of research, analysis and technical assistance. This category typically&#13;
includes: (i) economic and sector work and non-lending technical assistance; (ii) impact&#13;
evaluations; (iii) South-South learning and knowledge exchanges and other training services;&#13;
and (iv) contributions to global knowledge e.g. data, flagship publications (v) services also&#13;
include reimbursable advisory services, which aim to help member governments to adopt&#13;
policies, programs, and reforms that can lead to greater economic growth and poverty&#13;
reduction. Each government pays the Bank for receiving these services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Accounting for Social Safety Net Financing&#13;
&#13;
The Bank assigns sector and theme codes to investment lending and other activities that&#13;
directly serve an external client.7 As of 2001, the World Bank task team leaders have been&#13;
assigning up to five thematic codes to projects. Thematic code 54 is meant to capture social&#13;
safety net activities (sometimes referred to as social assistance) within the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
financing and knowledge services. The guidance note for theme coding defines Thematic&#13;
Code 54 as: â&#128;&#156;Activities intended to provide social assistance or social care services targeted&#13;
in some way to the poor and vulnerable (such as in-kind or cash assistance to poor and&#13;
vulnerable individuals or families, including assistance to help them to cope with the&#13;
consequences of economic or other shocks).â&#128;&#157;8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Theme 54 includes cash benefits to poor and vulnerable groups (such as conditional and&#13;
non-conditional cash transfers), in-kind benefits (such as food/energy/transport vouchers),&#13;
subsidies for goods consumed (such as rice subsidies or rebates for electricity), subsidies for&#13;

&amp;#12;services (such as fee waivers or subsidized connections to utilities), workfare programs&#13;
(such as cash-for-work), and institutional strengthening/capacity building for SSN programs.&#13;
The World Bank Business Warehouse serves as an internal information management system&#13;
that tracks data on the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s financing and knowledge services.9 For the purpose of this&#13;
portfolio review, the Business Warehouse was used to extract information on both&#13;
financing and knowledge services that had been categorized as Theme 54. The analysis only&#13;
includes Theme 54 activities, as this is the current institutional theme code for safety nets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Data and Resources Used to Examine Financing and Knowledge Services and&#13;
Results&#13;
&#13;
The main data that were used to quantify and evaluate the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s financing and knowledge&#13;
services and results were extracted from the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Business Warehouse system and&#13;
were valid as of July 8th, 2013. According to the financing data, there were 273 projects&#13;
approved between FY07 and FY13. All 273 projects identified as containing safety nets&#13;
(Theme 54) were included in the analysis, regardless of the amount allocated to safety nets&#13;
within the overall project. Information on knowledge services was also extracted from&#13;
Business Warehouse system, including all economic and sector work (ESW) and non-lending&#13;
technical assistance (TA) approved between FY07 and FY13 that was assigned as Theme 54.&#13;
A total of 281 activities were included in the analysis, 47 percent of which were EW and 53&#13;
percent were TA. Finally, the Independent Evaluation Groupâ&#128;&#153;s outcome ratings on&#13;
implementation completion reports for completed projects were reviewed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The review also included an extensive literature review of key documents. For the financing&#13;
review, the second stage of the portfolio analysis involved a review of project appraisal&#13;
documents (PADs) for all 273 projects. Following the same categories as were used in Grosh&#13;
and Milazzo (2008), each project was categorized by fiscal year, region, country, project&#13;
title, total amount of financing committed, whether it was an IBRD loan or an IDA grant,&#13;
&#13;
9                         th&#13;

&amp;#12;which sector board was supervising , country eligibility, theme allocation, type of financing&#13;
instrument, and type of SSN intervention. Some additional categories were subsequently&#13;
added: the number of project beneficiaries (as one of the main project indicators), which&#13;
donors/partners were involved, what co-financing was available, description on how project&#13;
links to wider safety net system, and the project development objectives (see Annex 1 for&#13;
the full SSN portfolio used in this review). For the knowledge services analysis, data and&#13;
statistics on knowledge-sharing activities including south-south learning forums, and&#13;
training were also gleaned from various publications, issue briefs, and Rapid Social&#13;
Response Annual Reports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The review also included a careful analysis of the impact evaluations for Bank-supported&#13;
social safety net projects between 2007 and 2013. Building on the f the Independent&#13;
Evaluation Groupâ&#128;&#153;s 2011 meta-analysis, the database was updated as of July 2013.10 After&#13;
careful quality verification, a total of 52 additional impact evaluations were added to the&#13;
existing database. Currently, the database contains 220 impact evaluations published&#13;
between 1999 and 2013, and 129 of them study the impact of the Bank-supported&#13;
interventions. This review focused on findings from the evaluations that were carried out&#13;
between 2007 and 2013 and examined key results and trends in those evaluations. Impact&#13;
evaluations were considered to be credible if they met four criteria: (i) they had a&#13;
development focus; (ii) they included counterfactuals; (iii) they were robust; and (iv) they&#13;
included quality checks11&#13;
&#13;

   IEG (2011b)&#13;
11&#13;
  As part of this review, all evaluations carried out between 2010 and 2013 were identified from World Bank&#13;
impact evaluation databases, academic journals, institutions, experts, and the teams involved directly in&#13;
impact evaluations. The specific World Bank databases used were the Africa Impact Evaluation Initiative (AIM),&#13;
the Development Impact Evaluation (DIME), the Spanish Impact Evaluation Fund (SIEF), and the Social&#13;
Protection Publication Database. The institutions consulted were the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab&#13;
(JPAL), the Innovations for Poverty Action Lab (IPA), and the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie).&#13;
Each evaluation that was considered in this review followed the same search methodology, screening process,&#13;
and cataloguing definitions as the initial IEG meta-analysis (IEG, 2011b).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        19&#13;
&amp;#12;Finally, the review team consulted knowledgeable Bank staff and the Independent&#13;
Evaluation Group (IEG). In particular, the complete financing portfolio was cross-checked&#13;
with similar exercises completed by the IEG in their evaluation of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s safety net&#13;
support between 2000 and 2010 and others that are currently ongoing.12 The cross-check&#13;
revealed important differences in the eligible pool of projects analyzed by the IEG, the main&#13;
distinction being the omission of additional financing, development policy loans (DPLs),&#13;
special financing, and recipient executed activities in the IEGâ&#128;&#153;s review. Nevertheless, the&#13;
individual classification of each project (for example, by type of intervention was largely&#13;
consistent between the two exercises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Limitations&#13;
&#13;
Although numerous sources were used to analyze the SSN portfolio, there are still&#13;
considerable limitations to the data. The official World Bank thematic coding system is not&#13;
fully precise and suffers from possible errors of inclusion and exclusion and in the&#13;
assignment of percentage shares to each activity.13Also, Theme 54 does not cover the entire&#13;
range of SSN activities supported by the World Bank. For example, it does not cover broader&#13;
social protection and labor (SPL) systems (which are listed under Theme 51, Improving&#13;
Labor Markets), social and welfare services for the elderly and disabled (listed under Theme&#13;
87, Social Risk Mitigation), community-based public works carried out by social funds (listed&#13;
under Theme 56, Other Social Protection and Risk Management), or food crisis response&#13;
projects (listed under Theme 91, Global Food Crisis Response).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Regarding possible errors of exclusion, projects with the theme code 91 deserve special&#13;
attention. Theme code 91 was introduced following the launch of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Global Food&#13;
Crisis Response Program (GFRP) in 2008, which was set up to provide emergency responses&#13;
to the sudden jump in food prices. To improve the tracking of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s responses&#13;
&#13;
12&#13;
     IEG (2011a)&#13;
13&#13;
     Grosh and Milazzo (2008)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             20&#13;
&amp;#12;to food crises, all operations processed under the GFRP were assigned to Theme Code 91.&#13;
Safety net activities to ensure access to food and to minimize the nutritional and poverty&#13;
impact of the crisis were included in 60 percent of GFRP operations, but often these&#13;
operations were not assigned to Theme Code 54. Furthermore, in the previous portfolio&#13;
review by Grosh and Milazzo (2008), cross-checking was done for all projects that were&#13;
approved by the social protection sector boards as well as projects under Theme 56 (Other&#13;
Social Protection and Risk Management) to minimize error of exclusion. However, the&#13;
number of projects that were identified as safety net programs after the cross-checking&#13;
exercise was minimal, and therefore the team conducting this review decided not to&#13;
replicate the exercise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Another problem with the data is that it is hard to quantify all of the knowledge services&#13;
provided by the Bank. This review undoubtedly underestimates the large body of tacit and&#13;
informal information exchanges between the Bank and its client countries, which have been&#13;
a hallmark of the sector in recent years. Third, it is harder to track trust fund data than&#13;
regular IDA and IBRD financing, which reduces the quality of analysis on this topic. Finally,&#13;
some of the literature gives a very partial and ex-ante view of particular operations, for&#13;
example, project appraisal documents. For these reasons, the review team has had to make&#13;
some judgment calls in some cases.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Overall Financing Portfolio FY07-13&#13;
&#13;
The safety nets portfolio from FY07 to FY13 accounted for just over US$12 billion, with 273&#13;
financing activities in 93 countries. The total value of all financing activities that contained a&#13;
safety net theme (Theme 54) was US$33 billion, of which 36 percent (US$12 billion) was&#13;
dedicated to safety nets. The average annual commitment for safety nets during FY07-13&#13;
was US$1.72 billion, a threefold increase from US$567 million per year during FY02-07.&#13;

                                               22&#13;
&amp;#12;The growth in the Bank support was especially notable during the period of the food, fuel,&#13;
and financial crises. The most dramatic increase in the safety net portfolio took place&#13;
between FY08 and FY09, right after the crisis hit developing countries in 2008. A large part&#13;
of this growth came from the expansion of well-established flagship operations, such as&#13;
Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s Oportunidades and Argentinaâ&#128;&#153;s Basic Social Protection Program. However, also&#13;
contributing to the growth in the financing were the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s newly established crisis&#13;
response programs that emphasized the most fragile states, including the Food Crisis&#13;
Response Program (established in 2008) and the Rapid Social Response Program, or RSR&#13;
(established in 2009).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Among the 93 countries represented in the portfolio, 42 received little or no safety net&#13;
support from the World Bank prior to FY07. The region with the largest number of new&#13;
countries receiving safety net support was Africa with 17, followed by East Asia and the&#13;
Pacific (EAP) with six, Europe and Central Asia (ECA) with three, Latin America and the&#13;
Caribbean (LAC) with seven, and the South Asia region (SAR) with one. This reflects the&#13;
expansion of World Bank safety net support into low-income countries in Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa, mainly in the form of the crisis response programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The safety net portfolio also increased in terms of its size relative to overall World Bank&#13;
lending. From FY07-13, 5 percent of total World Bank lending was accounted for by safety&#13;
net projects, up from 2.6 percent of total lending in the FY02-07 period. More importantly,&#13;
the percentage of safety net lending in the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s overall lending portfolio&#13;
experienced two peaks â&#128;&#147;in FY09 (6 percent) and FY11(8 percent). These peaks correspond&#13;
with the two highest peaks in lending for SSNs during the same time period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The allocation to safety nets as a share of total project financing has also become larger.&#13;
The average financing package of total project financing equals US$122 million, of which&#13;
US$44 million (36 percent) is dedicated specifically to safety nets. During the FY02-07&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             23&#13;
&amp;#12;period, the average loan with a safety net component was equal to US$92.4 million, of&#13;
which US$23.5 million (25 percent) was dedicated to social safety nets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Reducing chronic poverty and inequality is the main objective of most financing activities in&#13;
the portfolio. During the course of the portfolio review, all 273 financing activities were&#13;
coded according to their association with five core objectives (or functions): (i) reducing&#13;
chronic poverty and inequality; (ii) encouraging more and better human capital investments&#13;
by poor households; (iii) enabling the poor to manage the risk of individual shocks; (iv)&#13;
enabling the poor to manage the risk of systemic shocks; and (v) protecting the poor if&#13;
necessary during broader economic reforms.14 Many programs were coded for multiple&#13;
functions. The majority of programs in the portfolio (82 percent) were coded for their&#13;
contribution to reducing chronic poverty and inequality. Fifty-one percent of the programs&#13;
aimed to enable the poor to manage the risk of systemic shocks, such as climatic&#13;
irregularities and macroeconomic shocks, and 50 percent of programs promoted more and&#13;
better household investments in education and health. These trends are largely similar in&#13;
both IDA and IBRD countries, with only slight variations. For example, IBRD countries have a&#13;
higher prevalence of programs that aim to help households manage the risk of individual&#13;
shocks, such as health insurance or unemployment schemes, whereas programs that aim to&#13;
help households manage the risk of systemic shocks (such as climatic or macroeconomic&#13;
shocks) were more prevalent in IDA countries. Also, there was a higher prevalence of&#13;
programs that support investment in human capital in IDA countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14&#13;
 These functions are articulated, to different degrees, in the broader literature on SSNs and elaborated by the&#13;
World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Social Protection Department on its website as well as in its flagship publication, â&#128;&#156;For Protection&#13;
and Promotion: The Design and Implementation of Effective Safety Netsâ&#128;&#157; (Grosh et al (2008).&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
A small number of countries attracted the vast majority of financing. Ten countries&#13;
accounted for 70 percent of the overall financing portfolio, seven out of ten of which were&#13;
middle-income. 15 Four of the ten countries were in the Latin America region. This&#13;
concentration of funding for IBRD and LAC countries was because the great majority of&#13;
support during FY07-13 was allocated to well-established nationwide social protection&#13;
programs in middle-income countries where it was easiest to scale up funding quickly in&#13;
times of macroeconomic crises. Low-income countries tended to have a larger number of&#13;
small projects; for example, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),&#13;
Yemen, and Rwanda all had more than six operations between FY07 and FY13. During this&#13;
time, there were 163 financing activities in IDA countries and 91 in IBRD countries.&#13;

&amp;#12;IDA and IBRD Allocations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Although overall safety net expenditure was greater in IBRD countries than in IDA countries&#13;
during FY07-13, we observed signs of a strategic shift toward IDA countries. These shifts&#13;
were in terms of the number of countries newly introduced to the portfolio, the growing&#13;
volume of IDA expenditure in the most recent years, and IDA presence in terms of the&#13;
number of projects under implementation (see Figures 3a and 3b).&#13;
    Figure 3a/b: Allocation to Theme 54 and Number of Financing Activities, IDDA and IBRD FY07-13&#13;
FY07-13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
First, during this period, there was a dramatic rise in the number of IDA countries with&#13;
hardly any safety nets that received Bank support for safety nets for the first time. Among&#13;
the 42 countries that had limited or no engagement with the Bank before FY07, 27&#13;
countries were IDA countries. The addition of 27 â&#128;&#156;newâ&#128;&#157; IDA countries means that about 80&#13;
percent of all IDA countries (65 out of 81) have now received support for safety nets from&#13;
the World Bank. Before FY07, the number of IDA countries that had received World Bank&#13;
support was 39, or fewer than 50 percent of all IDA countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Second, the increase in the volume of IDA lending has been more prominent in recent years,&#13;
suggesting that this is a continuing and growing trend. From FY11 until FY13, there was a&#13;
positive increase in total lending to IDA countries, and in FY13, Bank lending in support of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  26&#13;
&amp;#12;SSN activities worldwide was higher in IDA eligible countries then in IBRD eligible countries,&#13;
at US$831 million and US$462 million respectively, which reversed a longstanding trend.16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Within the list of IDA-eligible countries, the Bank is also supporting several SSN operations&#13;
in fragile states and conflict-affected countries, mainly in the SSA, SAR, and Middle East and&#13;
North Africa (MNA) regions. â&#128;&#156;Fragile statesâ&#128;&#157; is the term used for countries facing&#13;
particularly severe development challenges, including weak institutional capacity, poor&#13;
governance, and political instability.17 Between FY07 and FY13, the Bank supported 22&#13;
countries that are classified as being in fragile situations, with over US$500m being directed&#13;
towards SSN activities. Examples of countries and places categorized as fragile include those&#13;
in a state of post-conflict (Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Timor Leste);&#13;
prolonged crisis (Somalia); fragile transition (Liberia, Haiti, and Sudan); slow progress&#13;
(Cambodia); and deteriorating governance (Eritrea and Papua New Guinea).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                            Box 2: Flagship Operations in IDA Countries&#13;
&#13;
For FY07-13, the three largest IDA programs were in Bangladesh (FY13, P132634: Safety Net&#13;
Systems for the Poorest Project, US$350 million) Ethiopia (FY12, P126430: PSNP Additional&#13;
Financing, US$296 million), and Nigeria (FY13, P126964: Youth Employment and Social&#13;
Support Operation, US$180 million). In IDA eligible countries (both low-income and fragile&#13;
states), the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s responses to the crises included subsidies and tax exemptions, public&#13;
work programs, and food transfers. In these countries, the impact of the food and fuel&#13;
crises was greater than that of the financial crises, given their lesser integration into&#13;
international markets and the relative importance of food in their overall consumption&#13;
basket. Most social safety net programs in low-income countries have tended either to&#13;
provide an immediate crisis response or to be pilot programs. Once countries have&#13;
established these basic safety nets, then any follow-up operations can focus on&#13;
strengthening institutions and scaling up or restructuring existing programs. Some country&#13;
examples include:&#13;
Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s Productive Safety Nets Project (PSNP), one of the largest IDA programs, provides&#13;
cash and in-kind transfers through labor-intensive public works to able-bodied households&#13;
&#13;
16&#13;
   The lending information for FY2013 includes both approved and pipeline projects. From the total of 88&#13;
lending operations included in the FY13 calculations, 42 are fully approved and the remaining 46 have yet to&#13;
be approved. The 46 pipeline projects are all defined as "possible/likely" to be approved in Q4.&#13;

&amp;#12;and direct support to other more vulnerable households. The program was first approved in&#13;
FY05 at a cost of US$23 million and was refinanced in FY07, FY09, FY10, and FY12 for a&#13;
US$470 million. It has reached 7.6 million clients or 8 percent of the Ethiopian population so&#13;
far.&#13;
Nigeriaâ&#128;&#153;s Youth Employment and Social Support Program was approved in FY13 at a cost of&#13;
US$180 million. It is a comprehensive program that provides public works and CCT to&#13;
youths from poor households, as well as supporting the government in defining and&#13;
consolidating the institutional responsibilities and implementation arrangement to ensure&#13;
effective coordination.&#13;
Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s Productive Social Safety Net (PSSN), implemented as the third phase of the&#13;
Tanzania Social Action Fund, was approved in FY12 at a cost of US$154 million. Its goal is to&#13;
create a comprehensive and permanent productive social safety net system with CCT and&#13;
public works components for the poor and the vulnerable.&#13;
In response to the food price crisis in Liberia, the Bank supported in 2007/2008a Cash-for-&#13;
Works Temporary Employment Program that provided more than 640,000 days of&#13;
employment to more than 17,000 beneficiaries. It has now been mainstreamed into the&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s social protection system.&#13;
Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s recent operation, Safety Net Systems for the Poorest Project, takes the lead&#13;
as the biggest IDA operation in terms of volume (for a single project). Its objective is to&#13;
integrate existing safety net programs and to improve their equity and increase their&#13;
efficiency and transparency.&#13;
In 2008, Pakistan launched an extensive social protection program to provide cash transfers&#13;
to the most vulnerable households. Within 10 months, the program provided cash transfers&#13;
to 2.2 million families. By June 2012, the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) collected&#13;
information on 7.15 million poor families, out of which 4.2 million (about 15 percent of&#13;
households in Pakistan) are receiving regular cash transfers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IBRD financing continues to be more substantial than IDA funding. In recent years, the&#13;
increase in overall safety net lending in response to the crises was unprecedented, and in&#13;
line with the countercyclical character of the interventions. This was particularly true in&#13;
IBRD countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Because safety net programs already existed in many IBRD countries before the financial&#13;
crises, it was possible to scale them up in response to the shocks in a timely and effective&#13;
way. These programs tended to be comprehensive, well-established interventions that were&#13;
flexible enough to be able to respond to crises. The systems and programs that were&#13;
already in place in these countries determined what kind of crisis response was feasible in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             28&#13;
&amp;#12;terms of what resources and administrative capacity were available and how willing the&#13;
governments were to respond.18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The response to the crises in IBRD countries was characterized by an increase in&#13;
government coordination in the EAP region, an unprecedented effort to avoid higher&#13;
poverty rates in ECA and LAC, and an expansion of the existing systems in LAC. The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
support was continuous throughout the crisis, mostly in the form of labor market measures&#13;
to protect jobs and stimulate employment. The Bank was more involved in MICs than in&#13;
LICs, mainly because of the demand from MICs such as Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina for&#13;
the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s expertise in SSN development. The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s support for IBRD countries tended to&#13;
be in a series of large financing operations over time in just a few countries whereas its&#13;
support for low-income countries was more thinly spread over a larger number of countries&#13;
and more limited in scope.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Overall, the Bank was most effective in helping countries with which it had had a&#13;
longstanding relationship in terms of financing, knowledge services, and country dialogue.&#13;
This long-term engagement had enabled these countries to develop SSN institutions and&#13;
had enabled the Bank to develop a deeper understanding of the countriesâ&#128;&#153; dynamics. This&#13;
was evident in such countries as Brazil, Colombia, and Moldova.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Throughout the last decade, the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s support for SSNs in middle-income countries has&#13;
shifted towards institutional capacity building and to the creation and strengthening of SSN&#13;
systems. In several IBRD countries, there has been a clear strategic shift in Bank support&#13;
towards coordinating its programs within a broad social protection strategy and in&#13;
alignment with the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s economic policies.&#13;

&amp;#12;                        Box 3: Flagship Operations in IBRD Countries&#13;
&#13;
 Safety net programs in middle-income countries have been tremendously effective, and&#13;
 the success of these programs is encouraging the creation of new projects in countries&#13;
 across the globe. In IBRD countries, a new generation of flagship projects has recently&#13;
 emerged, including in the Philippines (2008) and Peru (2012).&#13;
&#13;
 The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s support to Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s Oportunidades (US$1.5 billion in FY09, US$1.2 billion in&#13;
 FY11),a conditional cash transfer program, has benefitted 5.8 million families by increasing&#13;
 the coverage and improving the quality of health, nutritional, and education services and&#13;
 by promoting an increase in the number of children advancing from primary to secondary&#13;
 school and from secondary to high school.&#13;
&#13;
 In Brazil, the Bank-supported Bolsa Familia program provides monthly cash transfers to 12&#13;
 million poor households (about 25 percent of the population) who agree to send their&#13;
 children to school, meet vaccination requirements, and make regular use of health&#13;
 services. This program has been instrumental in reducing poverty and inequality in the&#13;
 country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Trust Fund Assistance in the Safety Nets Portfolio&#13;
&#13;
Between FY07 and FY13, trust funds provided US$97.7 million in total for safety net projects&#13;
executed by recipient member countries. Trust funds were particularly instrumental in&#13;
funding knowledge services during this time, and this is further explored in the next section.&#13;
Figures 4a and 4b represent the evolution of trust fund support for social safety net projects&#13;
over the FY07-FY13 period. Trust fund expenditure rose steadily since FY08 at the onset of&#13;
the food, fuel, and financial crisis and peaked in FY11. MNA is the region to which the&#13;
largest amount of trust fund grants have been given because of the abundance of fragile&#13;
and conflict-affected states in the region, particularly the West Bank and Gaza and Iraq, and&#13;
because several countries in the region have sufficient national capacities to implement SSN&#13;
projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             30&#13;
&amp;#12;During the time of the food, fuel, and financial crises, the Bank used trust funds to support&#13;
lower-income countries, especially in Africa. The Rapid Social Response Multi-donor and&#13;
Catalytic Trust Funds (RSR), Japanese Social Development Fund Emergency Window, and&#13;
the Global Food Crisis Response Program were the trust funds that were mainly responsible&#13;
for this expansion in safety net support at that time.&#13;
&#13;
           Figure 4a/b: Trend in TF espenditures (US$m and % by region)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The RSR in particular played an important role in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s increased support for IDA&#13;
countries within the safety nets portfolio, comprising about one-third (35 percent) of total&#13;
trust fund expenditure in the portfolio between FY07 and FY13.The rapid disbursements&#13;
from the RSR were particularly helpful in setting a basis for safety net interventions and in&#13;
turn encouraging larger amounts of safety net financing from IDA. By March 31, 2013,&#13;
US$34.3 million worth of RSR projects had been followed by US$3.1 billion worth of IDA&#13;
resources for 45 IDA projects in 34 countries.19 Trust funds were also able to leverage larger&#13;
amounts of safety net spending from donors and governments, for example, in Ethiopia,&#13;
Yemen, and Pakistan.&#13;

&amp;#12;Types of Interventions&#13;
&#13;
Figure 5 highlights the main types of safety net activities financed by the World Bank&#13;
between FY07 and FY12. One of the strongest trends in the portfolio has been the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
growing investment in cash transfer programs. In FY07-08, the Bank supported a total of&#13;
eight conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs and nine unconditional cash transfer (UCT)&#13;
programs worldwide. However, during the period of the food, fuel, and financial crises,&#13;
FY09-10, the number of CCTs more than doubled to 17, and the number of UCTs nearly&#13;
tripled to 25. By FY10-FY12, the Bank supported 50 UCTs in 32 countries, and 24 CCTs in 16&#13;
countries. The use of UCTs has made it possible to create safety nets in countries with&#13;
limited capacity and supply-side constraints. The increase in the amount of available&#13;
evidence on the positive impact of UCT transfer payments has also bolstered investment in&#13;
this area (see Section 4).&#13;

Public works programs also received more Bank support during the crisis period, mainly in&#13;
the SSA region. They were used as a short-term palliative to address the effects of&#13;
macroeconomic shocks during the crises. Eighty-five percent of the financing activities&#13;
containing public works in the portfolio were coded for helping the poor to manage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           32&#13;
&amp;#12;systemic shocks. Before the crises in FY07-08, there were only seven PW programs&#13;
supported by the Bank, but that number more than tripled during the crisis period FY09-10&#13;
to reach a worldwide total of 22 World Bank lending operations that supported PW&#13;
programs. In terms of regional concentration, 55 percent of all PWPs between FY09 and&#13;
FY10 were in SSA, which accounted for nearly 50 percent of the total amount of resources&#13;
allocated to SSN during the same time period. Over time, public works have evolved into a&#13;
flexible instrument to: (i) support multi-sectoral priorities as in Cambodia (road&#13;
rehabilitation) and Ethiopia (watershed management; (ii to address structural poverty and&#13;
employment challenges; and (iii) complement skills training, financial inclusion, and links to&#13;
intermediate services as in El Salvador, Yemen, and Liberia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During review period, the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s in-kind safety net support included food and nutrition&#13;
programs, basic transfers, educational transfers (including school vouchers, scholarships,&#13;
and vouchers), training for beneficiaries, health programs (provision of medical services),&#13;
energy, and housing. Although less widely used than CCTs in recent years, in-kind transfers&#13;
still are a significant part of the portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Technical assistance/ institutional improvement is the category of intervention that had the&#13;
most dramatic growth in the recent years. Out of 152 projects containing a TA/institution&#13;
improvement component during the review period, 100 provided technical assistance in&#13;
combination with other types of intervention, such as a CCT or a public works component.&#13;
In these cases, the technical assistance was often the sub-component that supported the&#13;
implementation or institutionalization of the main activity of the project. The remaining 52&#13;
projects provided technical assistance as the only safety net component in the project.&#13;
These projects often supported the strengthening of the institutional capacity of the client&#13;
government, helping to improve the administration, coverage, and targeting of the social&#13;
safety net and shaping new policies on which to build a harmonized and comprehensive&#13;
social protection system. The importance of such activities was especially emphasized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 33&#13;
&amp;#12;during the time of crisis when there was an emphasis on increasing the efficiency of social&#13;
spending to accommodate a tightened budget and increased need.&#13;

Lending by Region&#13;
&#13;
Figure 6 highlights the regional distribution of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s safety net portfolio, taking into&#13;
account both financial allocations and the number of projects between FY07 and FY13. In&#13;
terms of the absolute number of lending operations (and percentage change), there was an&#13;
evident increase in Bank support for SSN programs in SSA, ECA, LAC, and EAP. From FY07 to&#13;
FY13, the regional distribution was as follows: SSA (28 percent), LAC (22 percent), ECA (20&#13;
percent), MNA (13 percent), SAR (10 percent), and EAP (7 percent).&#13;

&#13;
In terms of the dollar amounts allocated to SSN activities, between FY07 and FY13 â&#128;&#147;as&#13;
depicted in Figure 6, the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s lending portfolio experienced two extreme peaks. In FY09,&#13;
the three main recipients of the increase in financing were in the LAC region: Mexico&#13;
(Oportunidades AF, US$1.5 billion), Argentina (the Basic Protection Project], $0.41 billion),&#13;
and Colombia (the Second Social Safety Net, US$0.32 billion). In FY11, the three main&#13;
recipients were in LAC and ECA (US$1.2 billion for Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s Oportunidades A-F, US$0.48&#13;
billion for Romaniaâ&#128;&#153;s Social Assistance System Modifications, and US$0.67 billion for&#13;
Argentinaâ&#128;&#153;s Basic Protection Project, which amounted to US$2.35 billion or 67 percent of&#13;
the total portfolio).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       35&#13;
&amp;#12;Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During FY07-13, the Sub-Saharan Africa region had the greatest increase in safety net&#13;
financing and activities, with a total of 77 financing activities and an allocation of US$1.75&#13;
billion. In terms of the financing amounts allocated to SSN activities, the SSA region&#13;
experienced a remarkable six-fold increase between FY08 and FY10 to reach US$270&#13;
million. During that time, there was a complementary rise in the number of activities,&#13;
resulting in the peak of 17 operations in 12 countries in FY10. This support has been&#13;
strongly sustained since the crisis. Between FY11 and FY12, there were 27 additional&#13;
operations with an additional US$714 million being allocated to SSNs,74 percent of which&#13;
was accounted for by two big projects, one in Ethiopia (the Product Safety Net Program,&#13;
US$296 million) and one in Tanzania (Productive Social Safety Nets, US$154 million). In FY12&#13;
alone, the SSA region accounted for 40 percent of the total SSN financing portfolio â&#128;&#146; a&#13;
staggering increase from pre-crisis level of less than 5 percent.in AFR,-13&#13;
              Figure 7a/b: Number of financing amounts allocated to SS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
For FY07-13, four countries (Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, and Tanzania) accounted for 45&#13;
percent of the Africa financing portfolio. During the same time period, the Bank provided&#13;
the region with 12 grants averaging US$1.9 million, 33 percent of which involved PW&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      36&#13;
&amp;#12;programs. Excluding projects with grant support, the average amount committed by the&#13;
Bank to SSN activities in Sub-Saharan Africa was US$65 million.&#13;
&#13;
From FY07 onwards, the Bank provided financing for an additional 16 countries that had&#13;
had no prior support from the Bank on safety nets, 13 IDA countries, three IBRD, countries&#13;
and 1 blend.20 The majority of these new financing operations occurred between FY10 and&#13;
FY13. More importantly, many more countries, including several fragile states, received&#13;
sustained support from the Bank during FY07-13, including the DRC, Ethiopia, Rwanda,&#13;
Kenya, Malawi, and Ghana.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In terms of lending type, the Bank provided a total of 59 investment loans (or 76 percent of&#13;
the SSN portfolio), and 18 policy/adjustment loans (all of which were DPLs). After FY09, the&#13;
region experienced a surge in DPLs, covering eight countries, both IDA-eligible (Lesotho,&#13;
Malawi, Ghana, Rwanda, Cape Verde, and Niger) and IBRD-eligible (the Seychelles and&#13;
Mauritius). While investment loans remained the main type of lending support, the number&#13;
of DPLs grew, largely driven by crisis response operations.21 As noted in the IEGâ&#128;&#153;s review of&#13;
the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s safety net support between 2000 and 2010 , the SSA region consumed a large&#13;
share of operations providing in-kind transfers (mostly school feeding) and the majority of&#13;
operations that supported PW programs.22 The portfolio composition has started to change&#13;
in recent years, with greater emphasis on UCTs, PWPs, and TA/institutional improvement&#13;
components. By 2013, the SSA portfolio included 11 CCT programs, 17 UCTs, and 38 TAs.&#13;
PWPs dominated the portfolio, with the majority of the activities supporting them either&#13;
partially or in full. CCTs became increasingly prevalent as well.23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
20&#13;
   The 13 IDA countries were Ghana, Kenya, Comoros, Nigeria, Guinea-Bissau, Central African Rrepublic,&#13;
Guinea, Cote dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire, Lesotho, Liberia, Mali, and Cameroon. The three IBRD countries were Mauritius, the&#13;
Seychelles, and Swaziland, and the one blend country was Zimbabwe.&#13;

&amp;#12;Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC)&#13;
&#13;
Overall, during FY07-13, the LAC region dominated the regional distribution of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
SSN activities in terms of financing amounts allocated, with a total of US$5.5 billion or 46&#13;
percent of the portfolio. The dominance was most apparent during the two major spikes in&#13;
spending in FY09 and FY11. As the crises unfolded in FY09, Bank support was heavily&#13;
concentrated in three countries â&#128;&#146; Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s Oportunidades Program (US$1.2 billion),&#13;
Argentinaâ&#128;&#153;s Basic Protection Program (US$414 million), and Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s Second Social Safety&#13;
Net Program (US$318.2 million). Support for these three programs accounted for 94&#13;
percent of Bank financing for SSN activities in that year. The absence of equivalent&#13;
allocations in FY10 was the main reason behind the 24 percent drop in Bank lending for&#13;
SSNs in that year. The second hike in FY11 followed a similar trend in that Bank increased its&#13;
support for Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s Oportunidades by another US$1.2 billion (60 percent of total&#13;
financing) and for Argentinaâ&#128;&#153;s Basic Protection by another US$480 million (see Figure 8b&#13;
below).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During this period, the nature of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s support in LAC changed. For instance, its&#13;
support for Brazilâ&#128;&#153;s Bolsa Familia project is now in the form of technical assistance aimed at&#13;
enabling recipients to graduate from SSN programs. The Bank increasingly became focused&#13;
on strengthening the SSN systems that were already in place and on investing in human&#13;
capital in order to enable families to break out of the intergenerational poverty trap.&#13;
&#13;

                                                       38&#13;
&amp;#12;During FY07-13, four countries (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico) absorbed 86&#13;
percent of the entire SSN portfolio. Eight countries (Panama, El Salvador, Grenada,&#13;
Guatemala, Dominica, Nicaragua, St. Lucia, and Antigua and Barbuda) without previous SSN&#13;
support from the Bank received IBRD, IDA or blended financing. This support was mainly&#13;
provided during FY09-10. Countries that had received Bank SSN support prior to FY07&#13;
continued to do so at varying rates (for example, Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico,&#13;
Jamaica, and Honduras).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Investment lending accounted for 62 percent of the portfolio, with the remaining 38&#13;
percent being DPLs. Throughout the review period, investment loans followed a rising trend&#13;
(mainly in FY07-10) while DPLs became more apparent from FY09 onwards. LAC continued&#13;
to be the leading region for lending for CCTs. Twenty-eight SSN financing operations in LAC&#13;
approved between FY07-13 supported CCT programs in part or in full. This represents 56&#13;
percent of all Bank projects supporting CCTs in all six regions around the world. In-kind&#13;
transfers (health, education, or nutrition benefits) were present in 20 operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This rapid increase in financing in response to crises in LAC was possible because most&#13;
countries already had effective SSN systems in place prior to the crisis. The majority of LAC&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             39&#13;
&amp;#12;countries that received Bank support for SSN activities in the review period was IBRD&#13;
eligible, and as such, has higher borrowing and spending capacity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Europe and Central Asia (ECA)&#13;
&#13;
During the review period, ECA was second only to LAC in terms of the amount of financing&#13;
allocated to SSN activities, with a total of US$2.4 billion for 55 operations in 19 countries.&#13;
Figure 9b below illustrates the impressive continuous (and almost linear) increase in the&#13;
dollar amounts that the Bank spent on SSNs in ECA. In FY11 alone, ECA received US$1.06&#13;
billion in Bank support, with Romaniaâ&#128;&#153;s Social Systems Modernization Project taking up 63&#13;
percent (or US$674 million) of that amount.&#13;
                                                    Figure 9a/b: Number of financing activities&#13;
                                                    and Total amounts allocated to SSN in ECA,&#13;
                                                    FY07-13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Even prior to FY07, the Bank was providing financial services to 16 ECA countries in support&#13;
of their SSN activities, all of which continued after the crises (either in part or in full). This&#13;
continued support was necessary because of the scale of the impact of the crises.&#13;
Unemployment increased by an average of 30 percent in 27 countries in the region.24&#13;
During this time period, the ECA region has explicitly focused on three strategic areas â&#128;&#146;&#13;
crisis response and readiness, employment activation, and aging. The Bank has also begun&#13;
exploring reimbursable advisory services as a business line (see below).&#13;

                                               40&#13;
&amp;#12;During the review period, Bank support was extended to three new countries, two of which&#13;
were high-income and IBRD-eligible (Poland and Latvia) and were gravely hit by the crises.&#13;
In FY09, the Bank financed the Polish Employment, Entrepreneurship, and Human Capital&#13;
Development Policy Program to the tune of US$221 million. The aims of this program were&#13;
to mitigate the social costs of the economic crises while continuing to support structural&#13;
reforms. Then in FY10 and FY11, the Bank supported the Latvian Safety Net and Social&#13;
Sector Reform Program, which aimed to protect vulnerable groups with emergency safety&#13;
net support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In contrast to other regions, the main financing operations in ECA were DPLs, covering four&#13;
countries (Romania, Poland, Turkey, and Latvia) and averaging US$177 million. This is not&#13;
surprising given that historically SSN operations in ECA were undertaken to help to cushion&#13;
the negative effects of reforms. The dialogue between the Bank and the majority of ECA&#13;
countries has centered on increasing the efficiency of existing SSN programs and&#13;
strengthening institutions. This had led to several long-standing relationships with countries&#13;
such as Romania that have focused on improving targeted and reducing error and&#13;
corruption. Overall, the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s investment loans in ECA have tended to be small, averaging&#13;
US$37 million in 13 countries.25 Many of these are Central Asian countries working to&#13;
increase SSN coverage and to put in place basic administrative mechanisms to improve&#13;
information management, payment systems, and targeting mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;

With LAC taking the lead in CCTs and SSA with in-kind transfers, the ECA region has the most&#13;
experience with UCTs. Thirty-seven percent of Bank-supported programs that included a&#13;
UCT component were in ECA in the review period. Since FY10, there has been an increase in&#13;
PW programs as an instrument for tackling short-term unemployment (for example, in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
25&#13;
 Romania, Belarus, Albania, Bulgaria, Moldova, Bosnia and Herzegovina, FYRO Macedonia, Bosnia-&#13;
Herzegovina, Azerbaijan, Serbia, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Armenia.&#13;

&amp;#12;Latvia, Kosovo, and Armenia). Programs providing in-kind transfers in the form of education,&#13;
health, and/or utility benefits have also been increasing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As in LAC, the ECA region had well-functioning, well-established social safety net programs&#13;
in place prior to 2008. The maturity and flexibility of these programs enabled a quick&#13;
response to shocks when needed. Figure 9b above illustrates the continuing increase in&#13;
Bank financing for SSNs in ECA from FY07 until the peak in FY11. This peak came when the&#13;
Bank approved US$674.88 million in support for Romaniaâ&#128;&#153;s Social Assistance Modernization&#13;
Project, which accounted for 64 percent of total ECA financing and nearly 20 percent of&#13;
total Bank support for SSNs in FY11.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
East Asia and Pacific (EAP)&#13;
&#13;
The EAP region experienced the biggest percentage increase in the number of financing&#13;
operations during the review period. As depicted in the figures below, the biggest jump in&#13;
lending operations in EAP occurred in FY10, a four-fold increase over previous years.&#13;
Nevertheless, EAP remains one of the smallest SSN portfolios, accounting for only 5 percent&#13;
of the total financing for FY07-13. Historically, safety nets have not been at the top of the&#13;
agenda in the country dialogues in the region. However, large-scale systemic shocks (the&#13;
Asian crisis and the recent crises) have made policymakers realize the benefits of SSNs for&#13;
protecting people during situations beyond their control.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The portfolio was dominated by three countries, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam&#13;
and was distributed equally between IBRD and blend countries. The total amount of&#13;
financing was US$626.89 million (80 percent of which were DPLs).&#13;

&amp;#12;During FY07-13, Bank support was extended to six new countries through nine financing&#13;
operations. This included support to both IDA and IBRD countries, including Mongolia,&#13;
Vietnam, East Timor, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Tonga. The majority of&#13;
these new activities occurred between FY09 and FY11. In terms of lending instruments, the&#13;
most common ones in EAP were PWPs, CCTs and in-kind transfers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The EAP financing portfolio was split almost equally between investment loans and DPLs. In&#13;
FY09 and FY11, Mongolia received Bank support through two DPLs, which aimed to&#13;
strengthen institutions in order to reform the existing social policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Middle East and North Africa (MNA)&#13;
&#13;
The MNA region constituted the smallest portfolio of all six regions, in terms of the overall&#13;
amount of financing allocated to SSN activities; mainly due to prolonged political instability&#13;
in the region. From FY07 to FY13, there was a total of 36 financing operations in ten&#13;
countries, totaling $0.4229 billion (of which, more than 50 percent were grants â&#128;&#147;either as&#13;
stand-alone or mixed with IDA/IBRD financing). The number of financing operations&#13;
followed a relatively stable trend during the same time period; yet, the amount of financing&#13;
allocated to SSNs increased over time (see Figure 11a and 11b below).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In the review period FY07-13 â&#128;&#147; in contrast to the other regions â&#128;&#146; financing activities were&#13;
spread evenly across a wide mix of countries including Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Yemen&#13;
Tunisia, Iraq, and Morocco. The majority of the countries are IBRD-eligible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In terms of lending instruments, 83 percent were investment loans, with the remaining 17&#13;
percent as DPLs. Of the investment lending, five operations (or 23 percent) supported PW&#13;
programs. Another four activities included UCT components, a few included in-kind benefits&#13;
(school feeding), and almost all had institutional improvement components. The DPLs,&#13;
though few in number, amounted for the big increase in Bankâ&#128;&#153;s support in MENA from&#13;
FY09-10 (Iraqâ&#128;&#153;s Fiscal Sustainability DPL of $67.5million and Jordanâ&#128;&#153;s Recovery Under Global&#13;
Uncertainty DPL of $35 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
From FY07-13, as portrayed in the graphs above, the demand for Bank support in MNA&#13;
increased in the wake of political tensions following the Arab Spring. Efforts have focused&#13;
mainly on employment generation for the youth (Public Works Programs), as well as income&#13;
support and institutional improvement/reforms. In parallel, there has been an increase&#13;
within the Gulf States for Reimbursable Advisory Services, which is discussed shortly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                            44&#13;
&amp;#12;West Bank and Gaza, alone, accounted for 40 percent of all lending operations during FY07-&#13;
13 (or 14 out of 36). During the same time period, WBG undertook ambitious reforms in the&#13;
Social Protection sphere, with strong support from the World Bank, and experienced a clear&#13;
shift in SSN policy away from in-kind and toward cash-based assistance. 26 Today, WBG â&#128;&#147;and&#13;
it main cash transfer program â&#128;&#147;CTP, serves as a model for effectively putting in place the&#13;
platform for delivering SSN programs in fragile and conflict settings, including the creation&#13;
of a new of a new unified registry, sophisticated MIS system and utilization of PMT in&#13;
effectively targeting the poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In MNA countries where subsidies were being phased out after 2008, the Bank played a role&#13;
in strengthening SSN systems, as well as trying to cushion the effect of the subsidy reforms&#13;
on the most vulnerable households. This continues to be a difficult and highly politicized&#13;
agenda. With the continued rise in food prices and recent security concerns and volatility in&#13;
the region, governments may feel pressure to reintroduce general subsidies or other widely&#13;
targeted compensation, which is likely to put the introduction of any further targeted SSNs&#13;
on hold.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
South Asia Region (SAR)&#13;
&#13;
Bank support in the South Asia region has been volatile, largely as a result of natural&#13;
disasters and/or economic crises. SAR was hit particularly hard by the food and fuel crises of&#13;
2008. As depicted in Figures 12a and 12b below, activities and financing both increased in&#13;
FY09, with the majority of interventions being emergency food crisis response programs (for&#13;
example, in Bangladesh and Nepal). More sustained support was given to Pakistan and&#13;
Nepal.&#13;

&amp;#12;The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s SSN financing operations were spread over three countries â&#128;&#146; Bangladesh, Nepal,&#13;
and Pakistan â&#128;&#146; and equaled US$400 million (or 90 percent of Bank SSN funding to the&#13;
region). All three countries are IDA or blend. During FY07-13, 77 percent of SAR financing&#13;
operations were investment loans, the majority being sector investment loans (SILs), and&#13;
the remaining six, or 23 percent, were DPLs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In terms of the types of SSN instruments supported, the majority of activities (11) had a UCT&#13;
component (mainly after FY09), followed by six PWPs, and four CCTs. Food transfers were&#13;
also extensively used in several South Asian countries to cushion the impact of the food&#13;
price spike in 2008.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Lending by Instrument&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Figures 13a and 13b below illustrate the annual distribution of SSN projects and their dollar&#13;
value for both investment and policy-based loans. In terms of the type of SSN instrument&#13;
used in Bank operations, during FY07-13, investment lending accounted for over 67 percent&#13;
of the total number of projects, which represented 70 percent of the total spending on SSN&#13;
activities. The remaining 33 percent of projects and 30 percent of dollar amounts were&#13;
policy-based or adjustment operations. Nonetheless, despite the lower amounts allocated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               46&#13;
&amp;#12;to policy-based operations throughout the last decade, we noticed a progressive increase in&#13;
the number of operations using development policy lending (DPL) instruments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It is important to point out that from FY07 to FY13, all policy-based operations were DPLs.&#13;
During the same time period, over 55 percent of all DPLs were in LAC and ECA (covering a&#13;
total of 25 countries), totaling 65 percent in allocations to operations coded as Theme 54.&#13;
With respect to country eligibility, an equal number of IDA and IBRD countries received&#13;
DPLs with SSN components, but IBRD countries accounted for over 70 percent of the dollar&#13;
amounts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A total of 32 countries that received funding through DPLs also received Bank support&#13;
through investment loans. The majority of countries that received both policy and&#13;
investment operations were IBRD-eligible (over 60 percent).&#13;

&amp;#12;Overall Project Outcomes&#13;
&#13;
On average, operations with an SSN objective performed better than the rest of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
portfolio. The IEGâ&#128;&#153;s objectives-based evaluation methodology rates the performance of&#13;
completed projects on three criteria: (i) relevance (of objectives and design); (ii) efficacy&#13;
(the extent to which the objectives were achieved); and (ii) efficiency (in achieving the&#13;
objectives). Between 2007 and 2013, the IEG rated the performance of 101 completed&#13;
projects (it is important to note that this performance rating reflected the whole projectâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
performance rather than only that of the specific SSN objective).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The IEG rated the operations that contained safety net components consistently higher than&#13;
the rest in countries of all income levels. The higher rating was particularly noticeable for&#13;
operations in lower-income countries, with 80 percent of projects containing SSN&#13;
components being rated moderately satisfactory or higher compared with 69 percent of IDA&#13;
operations Bank-wide. In terms of individual interventions, CCT projects had the highest&#13;
likelihood of having a satisfactory rating (Table 4).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The regional distribution of SSN-related projects rated as moderately satisfactory or better&#13;
by the IEG was highly correlated with Bank-wide projects, though with notably higher&#13;
performance ratings in SSA and LAC.&#13;
                                          Figure 14: Percentage of Projects with a Performance Rating of&#13;

&amp;#12;A breakdown by income level shows that, while SSN projects in IDA countries tended to&#13;
have higher overall performance ratings than Bank-wide projects, their ratings for quality at&#13;
entry (QAE) and supervision tend to be lower. The QAE ratings of SSN projects in IBRD&#13;
countries were slightly higher than Bank-wide averages, with similar levels of supervision&#13;
and performance standards.&#13;

&amp;#12;Portfolio Performance&#13;
&#13;
The social protection and labor (SP&amp;L) portfolio was one of the best performers in the Bank&#13;
between 2007 and 2013. The average disbursement ratio was 49.8 percent (as opposed to&#13;
23.1 percent for the rest of the Bank) and peaked at 82.3 percent in FY10 when most crisis-&#13;
related projects were disbursed. This strong performance was led by the LAC region with an&#13;
average disbursement ratio of 47 percent for both Latin American and Caribbean countries.&#13;
While the number of projects at risk increased, particularly after the beginning of the FFF&#13;
crisis, the overall commitment at risk (16 percent) remained more stable, even during the&#13;
crisis period, and was lower than the Bank average. This reflects the increased coverage of&#13;
SP&amp;L lending to traditionally risky countries. There has also been a noticeable dip in projects&#13;
at risk as the world emerges from the crisis period, especially in lower capacity countries in&#13;
Africa and Asia. For further information on portfolio performance refer to Table 5.&#13;

V.      Knowledge Services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During the review period, the World Bank provided a considerable amount of knowledge&#13;
services to improve safety net design and implementation. This section examines the&#13;
different types of knowledge services that the Bank provided, including: (i) economic and&#13;
sector work; (ii) technical assistance; (ii) impact evaluation support; (iii) training and&#13;
knowledge exchanges including South-South learning, communities of practice, and study&#13;
tours; and (iii) contributions to the global knowledge base.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Economic Sector Work (ESW) and Non-lending Technical Assistance (TA)&#13;
&#13;
The largest share of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s knowledge activities is country-specific and aims to meet the&#13;
needs and demands identified by its partner governments. The two main analytical services&#13;
that the Bank uses to respond to demand from country clients are economic and sector&#13;
work (ESW) and non-lending technical assistance (TA). The objectives of ESW are to inform&#13;
lending, inform government policy, build client capacity, stimulate public debate, and&#13;
influence the development community. The objectives of TA are to assist in policy&#13;
implementation, strengthen institutions, and facilitate knowledge exchange. Between 2007&#13;
and 2013, the World Bank spent approximately US$118 million on 281 SSN studies, which&#13;
covers both ESW and non-lending technical assistance, in 104 countries. A total of 133 ESW&#13;
and 148 non-lending TA activities coded as Theme 54 were identified. These analytical&#13;
studies have played a crucial role in informing country dialogues, in the planning of future&#13;
safety net operations, and in promoting knowledge exchanges. See Figure 16 for the annual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;distribution of these services by type, as well as the number of projects and the financial&#13;
allocations during the period of this review.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Between FY07 and FY13, the knowledge services provided by the World Bank reflected the&#13;
broader institutional movement towards more programmatic activities, often synchronized&#13;
with ongoing country operations. From a portfolio dominated by ESW, after FY09 there was&#13;
a clear swing towards non-lending TA (see Figure 16. This increase in the use of non-lending&#13;
TA reflected a trend in the Bank towards customizing knowledge that is diverse in process&#13;
and output and often focused more on implementation topics rather than big policy&#13;
choices. Often this TA was provided in tandem with larger programmatic financing.&#13;
Nevertheless, the Bank still provided a significant amount of ESW, which constituted nearly&#13;
50 percent of all of the knowledge services provided by the Bank between FY07 and FY13.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The predominant source of funding for both SSN ESW and non-lending TA has been the&#13;
Bank budget, but trust fund resources have become increasingly important in recent years&#13;
in financing Bank-executed knowledge products, especially in low-capacity countries. The&#13;
RSR, for example, has financed country assessments focused on safety nets in 11 IDA-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                       53&#13;
&amp;#12;eligible countries.27 This work has tended to be useful in terms of triggering follow-up&#13;
operations, for example, in Sierra Leone, Angola, and Burkina Faso.&#13;

&#13;
The regional breakdown of ESW/TA activities highlights the strategic role that knowledge&#13;
services play in supporting the broader portfolio (see Figure 17). Table 6 highlights a&#13;
number of these influential country and regional knowledge activities during the review&#13;
period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ECA: ECA accounted for the highest number and percentage of knowledge services (65&#13;
activities, 23 percent of the total). The emphasis on knowledge services/products comes as&#13;
no surprise in a region that has well-established SP programs with high spending. The&#13;
majority of knowledge services that the Bank provided in ECA (34) were ESW. Non-lending&#13;
TA rapidly increased (to 31 activities) in FY11 and has surpassed ESW every year ever since.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SSA: Within the last few years, the SSA region has experienced a surge in knowledge&#13;
services provided by the Bank (a doubling of ESW and a more than four-fold increase in TA),&#13;
which has mirrored the growth in its financing. From FY11-13, TA gradually surpassed ESW&#13;
and comprised 62 percent of the FY13 portfolio (with the majority of output types being&#13;
&#13;
27&#13;
     Angola, Cote d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, DRC, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Albania, and Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                              54&#13;
&amp;#12;how-to guidance notes, vulnerability assessments, public expenditure reviews, and country&#13;
economic memoranda). Within ESW, the majority were policy notes (such as risk and&#13;
vulnerability assessments or public expenditure reviews).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MNA: The bank provided a total of 28 non-lending TA services to the MNA region, the&#13;
majority of which occurred after FY09. The objective of most of these TA activities was to&#13;
manage the effects of subsidy reforms, including the Social Safety Nets for Subsidy Reforms&#13;
project in Morocco, the Improving Social Welfare Fund and Cash Transfer Targeting project&#13;
in Yemen, and the Electricity Pricing and Power Sector Reform in Iran.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
EAP: Knowledge services have been especially critical in EAP as the region has been&#13;
strengthening its social protection provision. The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s TA and ESW activities were&#13;
provided in a number of middle-income countries including Vietnam, China, Indonesia, the&#13;
Philippines, and Thailand as well as a number of smaller low-income economies including&#13;
Timor Leste, Cambodia, Fiji, and Laos.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LAC: In LAC, the Bank has had multiple years of sustained and integrated engagement, both&#13;
in terms of financing and knowledge services. In Brazil, for instance, the Bank provided eight&#13;
knowledge services (both ESW and TA) over five fiscal years, including policy notes and&#13;
risk/vulnerability assessments, to support the government in developing and improving the&#13;
Bolsa Familia program.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A significant share of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s country-specific knowledge work â&#128;&#147; especially during the&#13;
recent waves of crisis â&#128;&#147; has focused on social safety net assessments. Between 2009 and&#13;
2012, approximately 30 percent of ESW/TA products were safety net assessments. During&#13;
this time period, the Bank carried out a total of 60 assessments in over 40 countries and&#13;
four regions. The SSA region of the Bank has been particularly active in terms of producing&#13;
safety net assessments during this period. Between 2009 and 2013, the Bank supported 22&#13;
country-level social safety net assessments for African countries,28 as well as other relevant&#13;
reviews of specific types of safety net programs (such as cash transfers, public works, and&#13;
school feeding) in the region. Assessments have played a critical role in laying the evidence&#13;
base for follow-up operations, in helping to engage clients, and in identifying common&#13;
weaknesses that can hinder the establishment of robust safety net programs (such as weak&#13;
institutional capacity, limited monitoring, and financing constraints).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A further highlight of these country-specific knowledge activities has been the extent to&#13;
which partner governments have chosen to use the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s reimbursable advisory services&#13;
(RAS), fee-based advisory services provided by the Bank and paid for by the governments.&#13;
They were introduced to extend the provision of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s analytic and advisory&#13;
services beyond those that could be funded by the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s administrative budget and&#13;
relevant trust funds. The RAS is an important instrument for the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s middle- and high-&#13;
&#13;
28&#13;
  Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi,&#13;
Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, and&#13;
Zambia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     57&#13;
&amp;#12;income country clients, and for non-borrowing member clients it may be the only&#13;
instrument through which the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s knowledge services are provided. Between&#13;
FY07 and FY13, the Bank carried out 13 RAS activities out of a total of 250 programs (see&#13;
Table 7).&#13;
&#13;
There was a moderate rise in demand for RAS services in recent years, with the number of&#13;
RAS activities peaking between FY11 and FY12. Even though there were only a small&#13;
number of RAS activities related to safety nets, The Bank provided a wide range of RAS&#13;
support to client countries in the form of policy advice, ESW, capacity building, program&#13;
support, and impact evaluation. In terms of regional distribution, the majority of RAS&#13;
projects took place in MNA (seven) and ECA (five). In MNA, the Bank increased the services&#13;
that it provided to members of the Gulf Corporation Council, with the GCCâ&#128;&#153;s Country&#13;
Department acting as the liaison between the World Bank and the member states. 29 The&#13;
Bank has provided RAS on social safety net issues to four out of six GCC member countries&#13;
(Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait) in addition to providing&#13;
region-wide RAS support for building the capacity of the Arab Bank for Economic&#13;
Development in Africa (BADEA).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The food, fuel, and financial crises exposed structural weaknesses in ECA countries. It&#13;
resulted in an increased need for analytical and advisory work for policy analysis and&#13;
capacity building, which may explain the rise in RAS support during FY11-FY12.30 The&#13;
countries to which the Bank provided RAS support were Kazakhstan, the Czech Republic,&#13;
and Albania. Kazakhstan in particular received three safety net-related RAS activities, all as a&#13;
part of the Joint Economic Research Program (JERP), which is jointly funded by the Bank and&#13;
the Kazak government. The JERP was launched in early 2000s as a tool to help the Kazak&#13;
government to develop its economic and social development agenda. Most JERP analytical&#13;
work has been focused on public resource management, education, health, agriculture, and&#13;

Impact Evaluations&#13;
&#13;
This review identified 129 credible safety net impact evaluations covering 41 World Bank&#13;
supported projects in 24 countries between 2007 and 2013. The LAC region had the most&#13;

 Evaluations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
World Bank SSN impact evaluations (11 countries), followed by SSA and EAP with four each.&#13;
The high volume of impact evaluations in LAC can be attributed to the abundance of CCT&#13;
programs in the region, which is the type of intervention that was most frequently studied.&#13;

                                                          59&#13;
&amp;#12;There were 93 impact evaluations of 21 World Bank-funded CCT programs worldwide (see&#13;
Figure 19). There were also many impact evaluations of unconditional cash transfers (12&#13;
studies) and public works (14 studies).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Recent impact evaluations have focused less on the direct, short-term effects of the&#13;
program than on a diverse range of behavioral outcomes, such as changes in dietary&#13;
diversity, sexual behavior, and intra-household decisions. An increasing number of impact&#13;
evaluations investigated the impact of program design by experimenting with different&#13;
design features for the same program (such as different targeting approaches, size of&#13;
transfer, or degrees of conditionality) In recent years there has also been a surge in credible&#13;
evaluations of unconditional cash transfers, mainly in IDA countries in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
These evaluations used a variety of methodologies with approximately 47 using&#13;
experimental designs and the remainder using quasi-experimental approaches for&#13;
estimating impact. The most common estimation strategy used (27 out of the 129&#13;
evaluations) was a double difference (or difference-in-difference) approach. 27 evaluations&#13;
used a single-difference comparison of means using randomized experimental data. Other&#13;
common approaches used were regression discontinuity design, propensity score matching&#13;
(PSM), fixed effects, and multivariate regression with instrumental variables. Twenty-nine&#13;
evaluations used more than one strategy to check for the robustness of their results, for&#13;
example, using a PSM approach and comparing results with a difference-in-difference&#13;
approach (DID). The types of data used for evaluations included program surveys, national&#13;
censuses, and administrative data. The vast majority of evaluations used baseline data that&#13;
had been collected before the program began to be implemented. Around 80 percent of&#13;
evaluations used longitudinal panel data.&#13;

&amp;#12;South-South Learning and Knowledge Exchange and Other Training Services&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank has historically fostered South-South learning and knowledge exchange as a&#13;
hallmark of its safety net and wider social protection and labor practices since the initiation&#13;
of the concept 15 years ago.32 This has taken a range of forms, from large-scale conferences&#13;
involving hundreds of participants from dozens of countries and numerous regions all the&#13;
way down to one-on-one peer consultations and expert visits. All of these efforts aim to&#13;
facilitate the sharing of knowledge, especially first-hand country experiences. This section&#13;
looks at some of the most common learning activities used during 2007-2013: (i) South-&#13;
South learning forums; (ii) communities of practice; (iii) study tours, expert visits, and&#13;
twinning arrangements (iv) training.33&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
South-South Learning Forums&#13;
&#13;
From FY07 to FY13, there were four annual large-scale learning forums in Cairo, Arusha,&#13;
Addis Ababa and Hyderabad in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 for country practitioners and&#13;
global experts. They generally consisted of five days of plenary sessions in which country&#13;
delegations and experts discussed measures they had implemented with particular&#13;
reference to what worked and what did not as well as smaller parallel sessions geared&#13;
toward interactive dialogue focusing on specific country case studies. Each forum has also&#13;
included a field trip to look first-hand at safety net and social protection operations in the&#13;
host country. Time was also devoted to informal networking and group interaction in the&#13;
form of â&#128;&#156;global cafes,â&#128;&#157; marketplaces, and social events. The Rapid Social Response (RSR)&#13;
multi-donor trust fund has been instrumental in promoting South-South Learning by&#13;
sponsoring a major portion of expenses for each of the above events.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
32&#13;
  South-South Learning is the sharing of knowledge, experience and expertise between governments,&#13;
organizations, and individuals in low- and middle-income countries. It recently has gained more momentum as&#13;
governments have come to recognize that building social protection and labor systems is a prudent&#13;
investment and are now looking for help and information on how to do so.&#13;
33 Much of this section draws on Bratwaithe et al, (2013)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    61&#13;
&amp;#12;The evaluations of these events completed by the participants show that they were highly&#13;
appreciated. They provide an opportunity to bring together hundreds of people from&#13;
dozens of countries and multiple regions to learn about a specific topic and can be&#13;
especially useful to countries that are in the formative stages of program development or&#13;
are just thinking about reforms. The forums are a quick way to disseminate best practices&#13;
in different areas of SP&amp;L and have tended to facilitate the establishment of communities of&#13;
practice (see below). They can also contribute to the global knowledge debate. For&#13;
example, the Arusha Forum was followed up by a flagship publication synthesizing much of&#13;
the data and country experiences explored during the event. There are some challenges&#13;
inherent in these events including cultural and language barriers, the large amount of&#13;
administrative planning needed to organize such flagship events, and availability of funding.&#13;
The events have been attended by a growing number of donors and high-level government&#13;
counterparts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Communities of Practice&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Communities of practice (CoP) are online forums that grew out of South-South learning&#13;
events as collaborative spaces where people can share and exchange knowledge on a&#13;
particular subject. Professionals from a variety of disciplines and geographic areas now&#13;
convene in online spaces such as video conferencing and blogs and also, though less&#13;
frequently, in face-to-face meetings. Officials working to revise their SSN policy in one&#13;
country can connect with their counterparts and experts on other countries who have&#13;
carried out similar reforms. If an unexpected problem or issue arises, they can simply reach&#13;
out to members of the community for feedback, advice, and suggestions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Communities of practice tend to have a regional focus, formed by countries driven by&#13;
similar political economy situations as well as a common language. The main model for&#13;
communities of practice was the Latin American CCT Learning Circle. In late 2006, the client&#13;
countries with the most developed CCT programs in LAC (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, El&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             62&#13;
&amp;#12;Salvador, and Mexico) asked the World Bank to act as a regional facilitator of knowledge,&#13;
learning, and innovation for CCT programs. In response, the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s LAC region created the&#13;
CCT Learning Community, which client countries say has facilitated innovation and provided&#13;
them with timely advice on CCT programs.34 By the end of the 2010 South-South forum in&#13;
Arusha, a new community of practice (CoP) had emerged, building on this experience.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Today, there are SSN CoPs and peer-to-peer knowledge exchange forums in ECA, MENA,&#13;
LAC, and SSA that connect practitioners from different countries and disseminate best&#13;
practice. For example:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The SSA region community of practice was launched in 2011 and now has 11 member&#13;
countries (Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Nigeria, Sao Tome and Principe, South&#13;
Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia) through five videoconferences (with topics such as:&#13;
Targeting, Community Participation in Cash Transfers, Community-based Compliance and&#13;
Monitoring, Payments, and Governance), two face-to-face meetings in Tanzania and Kenya,&#13;
and numerous web-based interactions.&#13;
The MENA region has recently established a CoP on employment and social safety nets to&#13;
facilitate South-South knowledge exchanges initially in eight countries (Morocco, Tunisia,&#13;
Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, Djibouti, and Yemen), creating a space where practitioners from the&#13;
region can share their operational experience, knowledge, and best practices on issues&#13;
related to the design and implementation of employment and social safety net programs.&#13;
The work of this community focuses on three main elements: (i) operational support; (ii)&#13;
knowledge dissemination; and (iii) knowledge generation. The communityâ&#128;&#153;s events and&#13;
learning outputs are being widely disseminated through social media, e-platforms, and&#13;
corporate websites (such as the World Bank MENA Facebook page, the Jobs Knowledge&#13;
Platform Facebook page, and various Bank corporate and private Twitter accounts, as well&#13;
as blog forums).&#13;

&amp;#12;The ECA CoP on social safety nets was initiated in November 2011 and has had a series of&#13;
video conference meetings since then with regular participation by senior-level&#13;
counterparts (Deputy Ministers, Advisors, and Directors from Ministries of Labor and Social&#13;
Protection) from 12 low-income and lower-middle-income countries. These meetings&#13;
facilitated South-South knowledge sharing among countries in the region (Armenia,&#13;
Georgia, and Turkey) and outside the region (Mexico, Jamaica, and Brazil). In addition, a&#13;
face-to face meeting/ study tour for the ECA CoP on social safety nets took place in London&#13;
in 2012 to provide practitioners with experience of how the UK welfare system works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Study Tours, Expert Visits, and Twinning Arrangements. Study tours refer to visits by an&#13;
individual or a group to one or more countries or areas to exchange knowledge. Study tours&#13;
provide an opportunity for stakeholders to learn relevant and effective development&#13;
practices from their peers. In a survey conducted by the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Social Protection and Labor&#13;
department, several study tours were mentioned from 2007-2013. Study tours can play a&#13;
vital role in mobilizing support for reform among policymakers as well as during the initial&#13;
design stages, but tracking the impact of study tours is not simple.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Expert visits are when a country, city, or organization requests the Bank or another country&#13;
to send an expert on a particular subject to impart knowledge on her/his (or its) area of&#13;
expertise. The visits allow for in-depth consideration of an issue or problem and the&#13;
application of practical knowledge and experience to the local context. Some examples of&#13;
expert visits that occurred during the study period included:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Argentine experts accompanied by a Bank task team leader (TTL) visited Tunisia to&#13;
       introduce the model of their public works program, Trabajar. Prior to the visit, a&#13;
       public works program was not included in the policy dialogue for Tunisia, but after&#13;
       receiving a grant from the Bank , the Tunisian government is currently designing a&#13;
       program based on the Argentine model.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              64&#13;
&amp;#12;    ï&#130;·   After a delegation from Congo went to Madagascar, there was a reciprocal visit from&#13;
        Madagascar to the Congo.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   An expert from Mexico went to Grenada to review and discuss the targeting system&#13;
        and the proxy means test for Grenadaâ&#128;&#153;s cash transfer program.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   A monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) expert from the Dominican Republic visited&#13;
        Honduras to advise the government on their M&amp;E system.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Pakistan brought in an expert from Colombia to devise a product and give advice on&#13;
        SP&amp;L systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Twinning Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Twinning arrangements involve pairing an organizational entity in one developing country&#13;
with a similar, more mature one in another country. For example, Nicaragua and Colombia&#13;
have shared learning on the design and use of management information systems in CCT&#13;
programs, while St. Lucia and Grenada have done the same with regard to beneficiary&#13;
registries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank has offered Core Courses on Safety Nets since 2000. These are two-week long,&#13;
formal, and highly structured training courses for policymakers and practitioners in the&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s client countries as well as for Bank staff working on safety nets. They pro vide 60â&#128;&#147;90&#13;
participants from developing countries per course with valuable information and training.&#13;
These events have typically received the best feedback of any training courses offered by&#13;
the Bank. Overall, from FY07 toFY13, over 400 practitioners received training through the&#13;
Core Course on Safety Nets. This total rises to 2,000 if the South-South Learning Forum&#13;
series is included.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             65&#13;
&amp;#12;To complement face to face learning, the Bank created an e-Learning course called&#13;
Introduction to Social Safety Nets in 2011. This work was undertaken in collaboration with a&#13;
technical unit within the UNâ&#128;&#153;s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) that specializes in&#13;
distance learning programs. The course aims to support capacity building and on-the-job&#13;
training of policymakers, managers, and technical staff involved in safety nets and food&#13;
security policy and implementation. Built upon two key knowledge products (â&#128;&#156;For&#13;
Protection and Promotionâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;Safety Nets How Toâ&#128;&#157; ), the course consists of six lessons&#13;
containing interactive step-by-step instructions, case studies, exercises, and relevant&#13;
reading material. A course certificate is awarded upon successful completion of the final&#13;
assessment. Through the FAO alone, the course has been disseminated to over 2,400 users&#13;
since 2011, with 1,219 having been accessed online, 857 downloaded onto computers, and&#13;
295 ordered by mail. The vast majority of users have been from IDA countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Global Knowledge Products&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During the review period, the Bank produced a steady stream of global knowledge&#13;
products, mainly in the form of publications but more recently in the form of open-access&#13;
data platforms and benchmarking initiatives. A core component of global knowledge&#13;
products has been the Social Protection Discussion Paper Series, which featured 30&#13;
discussion papers focused on safety nets between 2007 and 2013. In addition the World&#13;
Bank commissioned a series of quarterly newsletters from 2010 to disseminate information&#13;
on new publications, developments, and events in the sector. During the formulation of the&#13;
World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Social Protection and Labor Strategy 2010, a series of influential background&#13;
papers were also commissioned with a heavy emphasis on safety nets, looking at their&#13;
productive impact, their role in crisis situations, and their relevance for low-income and&#13;
fragile countries and environments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Some of the most influential global knowledge products produced within the Bank during&#13;
this time period are shown in Table 8.&#13;

Safety Nets How       2011   Safety Nets How To is a resource guide for practitioners involved in the&#13;
To                           design and implementation of social protection systems. It pulls together&#13;
                             summary information, country cases, and guidelines on key processes and&#13;
                             cross-cutting issues, with lessons for everyday program implementation. The&#13;
                             information is organized in a standardized, concise, and accessible format&#13;
                             (hard copy publication and online toolkit) and draws on best practices across&#13;
                             from a variety of contexts, including middle-income, low-income, and fragile&#13;
                             states. The objective of Safety Nets How To is to provide practitioners with&#13;
                             technical knowledge on key implementation issues.&#13;
The Cash              2012   In 2009, growing interest in the use of cash transfer programs in Sub-Saharan&#13;
Dividend: The                Africa led the World Bank to initiate a comprehensive desk review of the&#13;
Role of Cash                 cash transfer programs that had been used recently in the region. This book&#13;
Transfers in Sub-            presents the results of the review. A total of 1,231 cash transfer programs&#13;
Saharan Africa               were identified in the review, although only a subset of these programs was&#13;
                             described in detail. The programs were diverse, ranging from emergency one-&#13;
                             time transfers, to unconditional non-contributory social pensions, to&#13;
                             conditional cash transfer programs (CCTs) with human capital development&#13;
                             objectives similar to those of the vanguard CCTs in Latin America.&#13;
Public Works as a     2013   The publication reviewed the conceptual underpinnings and operational&#13;

For example, the dissemination efforts during FY09 for â&#128;&#156;From Protection to Promotionâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
included: (i) a traditional launch event        led by Africa Regionâ&#128;&#153;s Chief Economist and&#13;
government representatives from Ethiopia and Colombia; (ii) desk-to-desk distribution to&#13;
key policy makers and decision makers within and outside the World Bank; (iii) electronic&#13;
distribution on the World Bank website and the creation of an e-learning module (jointly&#13;
with the Food and Agricultural Organization) and an extensive Wikipedia page on social&#13;

World Bank Safety Net Operations&#13;
&#13;
This review highlights the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s continued support for safety nets. Between FY07 and FY13&#13;
it had a safety net support portfolio of just over US$12 billion, which funded 273 financing&#13;
activities in 93 countries. The total value of all financing activities that contained a safety&#13;
net theme (in other words, were coded as Theme 54) was US$33 billion, of which 36&#13;
percent (US$12 billion) was dedicated to safety nets. The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s average annual&#13;
commitment to safety net support between FY07 and FY13 was US$1.72 billion, a threefold&#13;
increase from the US$567 million per year that was spent between FY02 and FY07.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Of the 93 countries represented in the portfolio, 42 had little or no safety net-related&#13;
support from the World Bank prior to FY07. During the review period, Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
was the region with most countries newly introduced to the portfolio (17), followed by EAP&#13;
(6), ECA (3), LAC (7), and SAR (1). This reflected the expansion of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s safety net&#13;
support into low-income countries in Africa, largely in the form of crisis response programs.&#13;
For the first time in the history of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s safety net portfolio, the gap between&#13;
IDA and IBRD lending closed. In FY13, the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s lending for SSN activities was higher to&#13;
IDA-eligible countries than in IBRD-eligible countries at US$831 million and US$462 million&#13;
respectively, thus reversing a longtime trend.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              69&#13;
&amp;#12;Major Lessons Learned&#13;
&#13;
Underlying these trends was a range of different country experiences of safety net design&#13;
and implementation. Our review of the project appraisal documents for the flagship country&#13;
operations discussed in Section 1 points to the following lessons that can be learned from&#13;
the main safety net projects that the Bank supported during the time period of the review:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Safety net programs, while traditionally designed to foster medium-term increases in human&#13;
capital, have a role to play in responding to crises and protecting poor householdsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
investments in their human capital. This can be seen by the recent increase in demand for&#13;
safety net programs in lower-income countries where risk, vulnerability, and transitory&#13;
poverty are often more prevalent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Governments should invest in safety nets during stable times to build programs that can&#13;
help them to respond effectively when shocks occur. During the food and fuel crises (2007-&#13;
08), the countries that already had effective safety net programs in place were able to use&#13;
them to respond to the effects of the crises, whereas the countries with no such programs&#13;
had to rely on ad hoc interventions. At the same time, the crises pointed out some&#13;
weaknesses in existing programs. For example, many IBRD countries found that their&#13;
poverty-targeted safety nets were not flexible enough to make it possible to increase&#13;
coverage or benefits as needed, while many IDA countries lacked the necessary poverty&#13;
data and systems to target and deliver benefits.35 These experiences have prompted the&#13;
World Bank to move towards a pro-cyclical financing model, in which it is sustaining its&#13;
support for safety nets after the crisis and is continuing to meet the needs of the bottom 40&#13;
percent during stable times.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
35&#13;
     IEG (2011)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             70&#13;
&amp;#12;Political commitment is critical to the sustainability of safety net interventions. The&#13;
involvement and commitment of sector ministries also makes it possible to plan recurrent&#13;
expenditure within medium-term planning frameworks. At the same time, the involvement&#13;
of local governments is also crucial because of the decentralization of service delivery in&#13;
many countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Before projects are implemented, policymakers should spend time upfront in developing a&#13;
solid institutional design built on country systems as well as local community structures. This&#13;
will help to define lines of authority and accountability, including for administration and&#13;
service delivery. It will also help to align incentives and financing and to ensure that risks&#13;
and remedies are identified up front. While using existing government channels and&#13;
institutional structures is consistent with long-term public sector management objectives,&#13;
relying solely on permanent civil service staff will not be sufficient in most countries in the&#13;
short term to address capacity constraints. Making use of contracted staff â&#128;&#146; which is&#13;
permitted within the civil service structure of most countries can ease implementation&#13;
capacity constraints and improve program performance, especially if combined with staff&#13;
performance incentives and best practices from community-driven approaches.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Safety net programs need an accurate and credible system for identifying and selecting the&#13;
target population. The available empirical evidence shows that the impact of cash transfer&#13;
programs on poverty and inequality is significantly greater when effective and accurate&#13;
targeting mechanisms are used. Designing and constructing such a mechanism requires&#13;
using appropriate criteria to identify and select beneficiaries. A good targeting system is&#13;
often complex to develop but can be used for many programs, not only for direct cash or in-&#13;
kind transfers but also for programs that provide health care insurance, school feeding, or&#13;
training. Once effective targeting instruments and recertification procedures are in place in&#13;
one program, they can gradually be expanded to other programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              71&#13;
&amp;#12;Detailed monitoring, evaluation and accountability mechanisms need to be designed and&#13;
implemented from the outset of a safety net program to provide transparent, timely, and&#13;
adequate information to all stakeholders. A strong monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) system&#13;
makes it possible to assess whether existing programs are fulfilling their objectives and how&#13;
their performance could be improved. Programs are monitored to evaluate their targeting,&#13;
to assess beneficiary take-up rates, and measure selected program outcomes. For this&#13;
purpose, the M&amp;E system collects information on selected process and result indicators,&#13;
tracks program caseloads and spending, and estimates inclusion and exclusion targeting&#13;
errors. The information generated by management information systems (MIS) serves two&#13;
critical functions: (i) it allows program managers to assess program operations and monitor&#13;
program targets and (ii) it enables policymakers, financiers, and the general public to hold&#13;
programs and their managers accountable for their performance. Consequently, setting up&#13;
an integrated MIS is crucial for producing continuous updates throughout the programâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
life. In addition monitoring should be complemented by rigorous impact, process, and&#13;
beneficiary evaluations, the findings of which are crucial for fine-tuning and re-designing&#13;
the program where necessary to ensure that it achieves its objectives. Furthermore, the&#13;
dissemination of such findings has often helped to secure continued political and public&#13;
support for safety net programs (as was the case in Mexico, Colombia, and Kenya).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Coordination between -donors â&#128;&#147; especially in low-income countries â&#128;&#147; is necessary to ensure&#13;
a coherent approach to safety net support. The transaction costs involved in this&#13;
coordination can be reduced by securing formal arrangements and dedicated staff. Care is&#13;
necessary to ensure that development partners are not excessively involved in the day-&#13;
today implementation of the program so as not to erode government control over the&#13;
programâ&#128;&#153;s management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Safety net programs should be designed to encourage beneficiaries to graduate from&#13;
support and to access human development services and programs. International experience&#13;
suggests that efforts to enable beneficiaries of transfer programs to access complementary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             72&#13;
&amp;#12;services and help them to develop strategies for graduating from support can be an&#13;
effective way to lift them out of poverty. Some successful examples of programs that have&#13;
taken this on board] are Jamaicaâ&#128;&#153;s PATH (the Program for Advancement through Health and&#13;
Education), Ecuadorâ&#128;&#153;s Bono de Desarrollo Humano, and Bulgaria and Romaniaâ&#128;&#153;s income-&#13;
generation programs. At the same time, the pace of program exit needs to be set against a&#13;
realistic assessment of overall trends and conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As safety net systems develop and programs expand in coverage, the role of effective&#13;
communications has become increasingly important. More than merely providing&#13;
information, communications facilitates public dialogue and social awareness, and provides&#13;
a mechanism to enhance program implementation. A well-planned and -executed&#13;
communications strategy can help identify program obstacles and opportunities for&#13;
program success, and promote an enabling environment to broaden program&#13;
understanding. Experiences in Pakistan, Brazil, and Indonesia highlight the role of strategic&#13;
communications in introducing, sustaining and reforming safety net interventions&#13;
respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A large body of research has shown that policymakers must pay careful attention to gender&#13;
issues because the outcomes of policies and programs can differ markedly for women and&#13;
men. In particular, understanding local socio-cultural dynamics is crucial for ensuring that&#13;
women benefit equally from SSN programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Evolving Nature of Social Safety Net Provision&#13;
&#13;
During the review period, there was a considerable amount of experimentation and&#13;
adaptation of core safety net interventions. The rise of UCTs has enabled the spread of&#13;
safety nets even to countries with such limited capacity that would make it difficult for&#13;
them to be able to deliver a CCT. The increasing amount of evidence about the effectiveness&#13;
of UCT transfer payments in terms of reducing poverty and vulnerability has also bolstered&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              73&#13;
&amp;#12;demand and investment in this area (see discussion below on impact evaluation results).&#13;
During the period covered by this review, there has also been a blurring of lines between&#13;
conditional and unconditional transfers, with some UCT programs (for example, in Kenya,&#13;
Ghana, and Pakistan) introducing some co-responsibility arrangements with less stringent&#13;
enforcement than in most CCTs. At the same time, the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s lending for cash transfer&#13;
programs is still heavily concentrated in IBRD-eligible countries and mostly on CCTs in LAC.&#13;
CCT programs have proven to be particularly effective in Latin America, where health and&#13;
education services are fairly widely available, and where there are fewer implementation&#13;
constraints than in some other regions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Although more than half of all CCT activities in the portfolio were in LAC countries, a&#13;
substantial number of activities â&#128;&#147; 11 out of 49 â&#128;&#146; were located in Africa. Unlike in LAC, CCTs&#13;
in Africa are rarely a stand-alone activity. Instead, they usually come as a part of a package&#13;
of safety net interventions that often also include a public works component. The three&#13;
largest CCT financing activities in SSA region â&#128;&#147; Nigeriaâ&#128;&#153;s Youth Employment and Social&#13;
Support, Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s Productive Social Safety Net, and Ghanaâ&#128;&#153;s Social Opportunities Project â&#128;&#147;&#13;
all combine a CCT with a public works component, suggesting that combining investments&#13;
in human capital with CCTs and with the building of community infrastructure through&#13;
public works may be the trend for a new wave of CCTs in lower-income countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In recent years, there has been a large number of impact evaluations of CCT programs in&#13;
lower-income countries in Africa. The evidence shows that these CCTs have had a positive&#13;
short-term impact on the incomes and the health and nutrition indicators of their&#13;
beneficiaries. Few of the programs in Africa have been around for long enough to generate&#13;
any long-term effects, and the evaluations have tended to focus on observing outcomes&#13;
related to the satisfaction of basic needs given the low-income nature of the countries&#13;
involved. It should be noted that only 18 percent of CCT activities in the portfolio were&#13;
located in regions other than LAC or SSA, suggesting that there is room for the expansion of&#13;
CCTs in the future to these regions in the future. As impact evaluations have suggested that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             74&#13;
&amp;#12;educational CCTs work particularly well in terms of promoting the attainment of&#13;
marginalized students, policymakers in MNA and SAR might wish to consider introducing&#13;
CCTs that contain conditions aimed at increasing schooling for girls.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Finally, during the review period, public works programs were introduced and scaled up on&#13;
an unprecedented scale. Public works programs tend to garner strong public and political&#13;
support because they are seen as contributing to a productive economy as well as&#13;
reinforcing a communityâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to manage its own affairs. As has been seen in, for&#13;
example, Ethiopia, Argentina, and India, such programs can be a flexible instrument. In low-&#13;
income countries particularly, public works programs have served several different&#13;
functions. For example, they have been used as a short-term palliative for the negative&#13;
effects of shocks with the World Bank approving 47 projects with public works components&#13;
in the wake of the FFF crises in FY09/10. They have also been used to support multi-sectoral&#13;
priorities as in Cambodia (road rehabilitation) and Ethiopia(watershed management), to&#13;
address structural poverty and employment challenges, for example, by providing&#13;
employment guarantees as in        Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s MGNREGS, and to complement skills training,&#13;
financial inclusion, or links to intermediate services as in El Salvador, Yemen, and Liberia.&#13;
Finally, they have often been introduced with the aim of supporting social stability and&#13;
cohesion, for example, by targeting youths and marginal groups (in Sri Lanka, South Sudan,&#13;
and Uganda).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Lessons from Knowledge Services&#13;
&#13;
The review underscores the critical role played by knowledge services in advancing the&#13;
safety nets agenda, especially in countries where implementation capacity is weak such as&#13;
South Sudan and East Timor. Aside from the wealth of technical reports and assessments&#13;
that it has generated, the Bank has been especially strategic in promoting South-South&#13;
exchanges and global knowledge sharing. During the period of the review, the Bank hosted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              75&#13;
&amp;#12;four global South-South Learning Forums and oversaw the establishment of communities of&#13;
practice in three regions, building on the initial success of the CCT Learning Circles in LAC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Links between Financing and Knowledge Activities&#13;
&#13;
This review has found that knowledge activities seem to have fostered subsequent country&#13;
demand for financing for safety nets. Among the 42 countries that were added to the World&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s safety nets financing portfolio after FY07, the majority (26) had also received some&#13;
form of knowledge services during the period between FY07 and FY13. In a sizable number&#13;
of countries, knowledge services either preceded or were provided concurrently with the&#13;
first financing support, with 10 countries having received knowledge services prior to&#13;
receiving financing36 and four countries receiving their first knowledge and financing activity&#13;
in the same year.37 It is plausible that ESW can generate demand among governments for&#13;
further support from the World Bank, at least in technical assistance. Among the 42&#13;
countries that had no World Bank safety net support prior to FY07, 17 had received ESW&#13;
between FY07 and FY13. Twelve out of the 17 countries had received technical assistance in&#13;
the years following the ESW, and one country received TA concurrently with the ESW.&#13;
There were only four countries in which technical assistance did not follow the ESW.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Knowledge challenges at country and global level&#13;
&#13;
While the Bank has had a number of achievements in its provision of knowledge services&#13;
(see Section 4), some challenges remain.&#13;
At country level:&#13;
Despite the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to expand country knowledge services, there is still a gap&#13;
between IDA and IBRD countries, albeit one that has shrunk in the last several years. For the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
36&#13;
     Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Guinea, Mali, Mauritius, Togo, Timor, Jordan, Lebanon, and Nepal&#13;
37&#13;
     Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Vietnam, and El Salvador&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       76&#13;
&amp;#12;period FY07-13, only 29 percent of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s knowledge services (both ESW and TA) were&#13;
provided to low-income countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Typically the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s budget can only be used to fund knowledge services in countries where&#13;
the Bank already has an operational presence. This restriction has been overcome to some&#13;
extent in recent years with the advent of trust fund financing such as the Rapid Social&#13;
Response Fund, which is applicable only to low-income countries. However, as these trust&#13;
funds have increasingly scarce budgets and an increased number of countries to support,&#13;
there is a risk of small and fragmented technical assistance work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Increasing demand for customized technical assistance poses challenge, because of the&#13;
many different forms and themes that may be requested. This can stretch the limits of&#13;
available technical expertise.&#13;
The methodologies and approaches that the Bank uses to undertake country assessments&#13;
vary and are dependent on what information is available at the country level. Additionally,&#13;
country assessments are time-consuming and labor-intensive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Globally:&#13;
The distillation of timely and relevant global knowledge requires broad input, including&#13;
expertize from country level and global partners. This requires careful planning and&#13;
investment, as well as mechanisms to capture best practice from outside of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There are challenges to ensure high quality and comparable data. Quality control and&#13;
accountability are critically important, and require investment especially at country level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There is a recognized need to enhance incentives, mechanisms, tools and processes to&#13;
promote selecting and sharing of knowledge across countries, teams, functions and&#13;
institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              77&#13;
&amp;#12;Evaluating and Measuring Results&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank has various options for measuring the results achieved by Bank-supported&#13;
safety net projects. It is possible to get a general sense of overall trends and primary impact&#13;
from the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Aspire Database, its Corporate Score Indicators, and completed&#13;
impact evaluations. The performance of individual projects and their key outcomes can be&#13;
obtained by reviewing their implementation completion reports and project performance&#13;
portfolio information.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s tracking of safety net coverage and impact has not been consistent and is an&#13;
area that is now being strengthened, especially in light of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Social Protection&#13;
and Labor Strategy. The strategyâ&#128;&#153;s results framework outlines a series of outputs and&#13;
outcomes at both the World Bank and the country level that are being tracked in order to&#13;
assess progress towards achieving the goals of the strategy over the next 10 years. The&#13;
results framework follows a three-tier approach that reflects respectively the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
contribution to sectoral development outcomes (Tier 1), country outcomes and outputs&#13;
attributable to Bank support (Tier 2), and the actions and activities for which the World&#13;
Bank will be accountable (Tier 3). Each tier tracks the progress made by countries and the&#13;
World Bank in the main focus areas of the strategy. The results framework indicators from&#13;
the strategy are consistent with other institutional frameworks as well, including the World&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Corporate Scorecard Indicator, a recent initiative that looks at the coverage of active&#13;
safety net projects supported by the Bank and their breakdown by gender.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Information published in the latest version of the Corporate Scorecard Indicator suggests&#13;
that the average annual number of beneficiaries receiving Bank-financed safety net support&#13;
during FY09-11 was 141 million. When the baseline number collected in FY09 (141.6 million)&#13;
and the number collected from program exit reviews in FY11 (141.1 million) are compared,&#13;
it can be seen that coverage was stable over the three-year period. Data on the number of&#13;

&amp;#12;women and girls benefitting from Bank-financed social protection programs were collected&#13;
in FY12, and the number came to 78 million.38&#13;

Evidence from the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s new ASPIRE database shows that, each year, safety nets in&#13;
developing countries lift 50.3 million people out of absolute poverty (defined as living on&#13;
less than US$1.25 a day). At the same time, 96.4 million people are lifted out of the bottom&#13;
quintile (relative poverty). Overall, this represents a significant impact on the global fight&#13;
against poverty.&#13;

&amp;#12;Results from Impact Evaluations&#13;
&#13;
Recent impact evaluations of established CCT projects have begun to find that these&#13;
programs are having not only short-term effects but also a longer-term positive impact on&#13;
the welfare of recipients. They have also found that both longstanding and newer CCT&#13;
programs are affecting household decision-making in ways that have policy implications.&#13;
This evidence comes mainly from Latin America, specifically from programs in Mexico,&#13;
Colombia, Nicaragua, and Brazil.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Evaluations have shown that, after five and a half years of providing program benefits,&#13;
Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s Oportunidades program has had a positive and sustained impact in terms of&#13;
improving school enrollment, reducing child and youth labor, increasing employment for&#13;
older girls, and facilitating a shift in employment in rural areas from agricultural to non-&#13;
agricultural work.39 A government evaluation from 2008 found that former Oportunidades&#13;
beneficiaries were more likely to enter middle-class occupations than non-beneficiaries,&#13;
while their share of better paying jobs was on average 25 percentage points higher. 40 In&#13;
contrast, a study from 2011 found that Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s Familias en Accion had had no significant&#13;
impact on the cognitive development of beneficiary children. 41 The study found that&#13;
participating children were 4 to 8 percentage points more likely than non-participating&#13;
children to finish high school (particularly girls and beneficiaries in rural areas), but&#13;
recipients who graduated from high school seemed to perform at the same level as equally&#13;
poor non-recipient graduates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The findings of evaluations of Nicaraguaâ&#128;&#153;s AtenciÃ³n a Crisis underscored the long-term&#13;
positive potential of health interventions focusing on early childhood intervention. It was&#13;
found that households who received AtenciÃ³n a Crisis transfers had increased their&#13;

&amp;#12;expenditure on critical inputs into child development (such as more nutrient-rich foods,&#13;
more early stimulation provided to children, and more use of preventative health care). This&#13;
had led to improvements in the cognitive outcomes of children aged 36 months old from&#13;
beneficiary households, and even two years after the program was ended and the transfers&#13;
had been discontinued, these positive effects continued.42&#13;
&#13;
Impact evaluations of both established and newer programs are helping policymakers to&#13;
understand the causal pathways leading to positive outcomes. A 2012 evaluation of Brazilâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Bolsa FamÃ­lia program yielded evidence of how beneficiary women made decisions that&#13;
resulted in better living conditions for both children and women.43 Also, a 2012 evaluation&#13;
of Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s Tayssir CCT found a significant difference in the amount of time children had&#13;
available for learning when transfers were given to female heads of household as opposed&#13;
to male heads of households. The study found that children in the female-headed&#13;
households spent around five more hours a day in schoolâ&#128;&#144;related activities than children&#13;
from male-headed households 44&#13;
&#13;
In recent years, there has been a breakthrough in the evidence base documenting the&#13;
impact of unconditional cash transfers. Evaluations have highlighted the growing interest&#13;
from governments in so-called â&#128;&#156;social cash transfersâ&#128;&#157; (or UCTs) as a way to improve human&#13;
development and poverty outcomes and foster local economic development, particularly in&#13;
low-capacity countries. Evaluations have shown that UCTs can help vulnerable households&#13;
to manage risk by immediately increasing their income and consumption, although the&#13;
magnitude of these effects depends on the initial conditions and implementation logistics.&#13;
For example, a one-time unconditional transfer provided in the West Bank region enabled&#13;
recipient households to maintain their food consumption levels and even to significantly&#13;
improve the quality and increase the variety of food that they consumed. 45 Ghanaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) program is reported to have led to a&#13;

&amp;#12;significant 14 percent increase in the likelihood of beneficiary households being able to&#13;
save.46 An innovative simulation analysis of Lesothoâ&#128;&#153;s Child Grants Program in 2012&#13;
suggested that cash transfers can have significant positive effects not only at the household&#13;
level but also on the local economy, as it found that the program had generated US$2.23 in&#13;
income within local communities for every dollar provided to the beneficiaries.47 Few&#13;
evaluations have directly assessed human development outcomes, but some notable&#13;
findings have emerged on the links between UCTs and education. A 2011 evaluation of LEAP&#13;
in Ghana found that the program had increased school enrollment by an average of seven&#13;
percentage points, though these results varied between male and female children. For&#13;
females, the effect of LEAP was to increase the attendance of those already enrolled in&#13;
school. For males, LEAP increased both access and progression between grades.48 Also, a&#13;
2013 evaluation of Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s Youth Opportunities Program found that 75 percent of direct&#13;
grant beneficiaries spend a portion of their transfer on technical and vocational training. 49&#13;
&#13;
Public works interventions have been found to have a positive effect on income,&#13;
consumption, and employment, particularly in agricultural economies and during covariate&#13;
shocks. A 2011 evaluation of Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) found that&#13;
the program had led to consumption gains among beneficiary households. Receiving public&#13;
works payments for five years yielded an increase of 1.05 months of food security&#13;
compared to having received no transfers in all regions where the PSNP was being&#13;
implemented.50 Another study found that PSNP beneficiaries had significantly increased&#13;
their livestock holdings, while the combination of the PSNP together with another&#13;
complementary program (OFSP/HABP) led to considerable increases in the use of fertilizer&#13;
and enhanced investments that were likely to increase agricultural productivity among&#13;
households receiving both benefits. However, only in some cases had this resulted in&#13;

&amp;#12;observed increases in production yields. 51 A 2012 report tracked the success of Latviaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Workplaces with Stipends (WWS) program, which had been introduced in response to the&#13;
2008 financial crisis.52 The evaluation found that the program had been successful in&#13;
targeting poor and vulnerable people with minimal leakage to non-poor households. Almost&#13;
83 percent of WWS beneficiaries were in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution,&#13;
and the program was credited with raising the income of participating households by 37&#13;
percent in the short term.53 Yemenâ&#128;&#153;s Labor-intensive Public Works Program was expected to&#13;
protect beneficiaries from the negative effects of the economic crisis by providing them&#13;
with additional days of work. The evaluation of this program coincided with incidents of&#13;
armed conflict, economic paralysis due to fuel shortages and general instability during the&#13;
widespread protests associated with the Arab Spring of 2011. During this period the&#13;
program was found to have increased participantsâ&#128;&#153; income by approximately US$23 per&#13;
month in active projects, but this change was not statistically significant. However, the&#13;
program led to a meaningful and significant increase in average consumption of between&#13;
320 and 435 calories per day, equivalent to an 11 to 13 percent increase in calorie&#13;
consumption in participating communities compared to non-participating communities.54&#13;
In-kind transfers, particularly food-based programs, have had a significant positive impact in&#13;
situations where cash has limited use or fluctuating value. In situations where purchasing&#13;
power changes rapidly and food insecurity is a concern, for example, Ethiopia in 2007, a&#13;
combination of food and cash transfers has proved to be the best way to protect beneficiary&#13;
households. Comparing different groups of Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP)&#13;
beneficiaries, a 2010 report showed that between 2006 and 2008 receiving food and/or a&#13;
combination of food and cash was more effective than cash payments in protecting&#13;
households measured in terms of income changes, assets, and the food gap. 55 Specifically,&#13;
the income of households that received in-kind food payments grew by 59 percent more&#13;

VII.    Conclusions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 The review highlights the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s strong support for the continued expansion of safety nets&#13;
 through diverse financing and knowledge activities. The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s support for safety&#13;
 net expansion is most visibly evidenced through financing activities amounting to just over&#13;
 $12 billion between FY07-13. During this time period the average annual commitment for&#13;
 safety nets during was US$1.72 billion, a threefold increase from US$567 million per year&#13;
 during FY02-07.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 In recent years the Bank has supported the consolidation of established programs and&#13;
 emergence of new ones, especially in low income settings. The portfolio continues to reflect&#13;
 the importance and consolidation of safety nets in middle income countries. Greater IBRD&#13;
 financing commitments â&#128;&#147; especially in LCR and ECA regions - reflect the mature nature of&#13;
 these programs, especially a handful of flagship operations which have required major&#13;
 investment to expand coverage and promote program reforms. These countries are also&#13;
 becoming increasingly important in sharing south-south knowledge. At the same time there&#13;
 is a new generation of promising IBRD interventions, including in the Philippines, as well as&#13;
 a pipeline operations for Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 The expansion of safety nets in lower income settings is a notable advancement of the&#13;
 portfolio. Among the 93 countries represented in the portfolio, 42 had no or limited&#13;
 exposure to the World Bank safety nets engagement prior to FY07. Africa was the region&#13;
 with the most number of countries newly introduced to the portfolio (17), reflecting the&#13;
 increase of World Bank support for safety nets in low-inome countries, aided also by the&#13;
 crisis response. For the first time in the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Safety Net portfolioâ&#128;&#153;s history, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              84&#13;
&amp;#12;review reports a convergence of the gap between IDA and IBRD lending in support of SSN&#13;
activities worldwide. In FY13, lending allocated towards SSN activities was higher in IDA&#13;
eligible countries compared to IBRD eligible countries, at US$831 million and US$462&#13;
million, respectively, reversing a longtime trend.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Knowledge services now comprise a critical component of World Bank support to the safety&#13;
nets agenda, especially in low capacity contexts where implementation capacity is weak.&#13;
During the time period of the review the World Bank spent approximately $118 million on&#13;
281 safety net studies - covering economic and sector work, and non-lending technical&#13;
assistance and covering 104 countries and regions. Between 2009-2012 alone, the Bank&#13;
conducted a total of 60 Safety Net assessments, covering 40 countries in 4 regions. Aside&#13;
from the wealth of technical reports and assessments generated, the Bank has been&#13;
especially strategic in promoting South-South exchange and global knowledge. In the course&#13;
of the review the Bank hosted four global South-South Learning Forum Events, and saw the&#13;
evolution of practitioner Communities of Practice in three regions, building on the initial&#13;
success of the LAC CCT Learning Circles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Some major observations emerging from the review are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
World Bank supported safety net projects play a major role in addressing chronic poverty&#13;
and inequality, and in turn meeting the needs of bottom population quintiles. Some 82% of&#13;
projects reviewed had chronic poverty and reduction of inequality as their main function.&#13;
The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Corporate Scorecard illustrates that in FY11, total beneficiary numbers of&#13;
safety net beneficiaries reached at least 114 million. Even more impressive is the data&#13;
provided by the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s ASPIRE database, which shows that each year; safety nets in&#13;
developing countries lift 50.3 million people from absolute poverty. At the same time,&#13;
safety nets play a major role in responding to shocks and transitory needs. Some 51% of&#13;
projects reviewed including mechanisms to manage risk from system shocks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              85&#13;
&amp;#12;One of the major lessons emerging from the triple wave of food, fuel and finance crises was&#13;
recognition of the need to invest continuously in safety nets during stable times so that&#13;
programs can be scaled up effectively when shocks occur.            These experiences have&#13;
prompted the World Bank to move towards a pro-cyclical financing model where it is&#13;
sustaining support for safety nets after a crisis and meeting basic needs of the bottom&#13;
population quintiles during stable times.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Countries require customized support in order to effectively design and implement safety&#13;
net programs. A hallmark of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s support to safety nets concerns technical&#13;
assistance and institutional improvement, which were factored into the vast majority of&#13;
projects in the portfolio. These projects often support the strengthening of the institutional&#13;
capacity of the client government and the social sector reform, making improvements in the&#13;
administration, coverage and targeting of social safety net and shaping new social safety&#13;
nets policies to provide the foundation for building a harmonized and comprehensive&#13;
system of social protection. The importance of such activities was especially emphasized&#13;
during the time of crisis when there was an emphasis on a more efficient social spending&#13;
with a tightened budget and an increased need.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Robust evidence continues to mount on the impacts of social safety nets, although more&#13;
research is needed. During the review time period approximately 129 credible safety net&#13;
impact evaluations covering 41 World Bank supported projects in 24 countries were&#13;
identified. Findings from these evaluations are providing a strong evidence base of social&#13;
safety nets on a vast range of dimensions, such as poverty, inequality, food security and&#13;
nutrition, human capital, local economic multipliers, investments in productive activities,&#13;
risk resilience, social cohesion, and others. Yet more research might be needed on the&#13;
performance of alternative design and implementation options, on linking social safety nets&#13;
to the â&#128;&#152;graduationâ&#128;&#153; agenda, and on adapting social safety nets to different contexts,&#13;
particularly urban areas and fragile states.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               86&#13;
&amp;#12;Safety net interventions are evolving to support broader social protection initiatives and&#13;
multi-sectoral strategies. In recent years there has been an increase in Conditional Cash and&#13;
Unconditional Cash transfers, as well as interventions that fall somewhat in between i.e.,&#13;
soft conditionalities. The use of public works instruments has also evolved considerably to&#13;
meet complementary objectives such as temporary employment creation and&#13;
environmental protection through asset accumulation as examples. The integration of these&#13;
activities with broader interventions raises challenges to ensure continued quality of&#13;
technical support, ability to assess impact and plan for long term sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank is investing heavily in knowledge services to advance the safety nets&#13;
agenda at both global and country level.         A strength of knowledge support has been&#13;
investment towards cross country learning and technical knowledge exchange amongst&#13;
country level practitioners. Knowledge activities have fostered subsequent country demand&#13;
for safety net financings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Finally, it is significant to note that the safety nets portfolio at the Bank has been one of the&#13;
best performing during FY2007-2013. On average, the disbursement ratio was 49.8 percent&#13;
(against 23.1 percent for the rest of the Bank) and peaked at 82.3 percent in FY10, when the&#13;
crisis-related projects disbursed in earnest. Although, the bank extended safety net&#13;
program coverage to riskier countries (i.e. fragile states), the overall commitment at risk (16&#13;
percent) remained more stable, even during the crisis period, and below the Bank average.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Going forward the future trends in the portfolio are projected as follows:&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   A continued emphasis on integration and systems building, combining safety net&#13;
       interventions with broader social protection strategies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               87&#13;
&amp;#12;ï&#130;·   Progressive scaling up of interventions in low income settings, including&#13;
    customization efforts to ensure programs are flexible in light of crisis situations and&#13;
    ongoing needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   Greater attention to identify appropriate customization of interventions in low&#13;
    capacity and fragile situations, with much focus on institutional design and capacity&#13;
    services, including the role of third party delivery agents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   Sustained engagement in middle income countries, with a shift towards&#13;
    strengthening of SSN systems, within framework of broader social protection and&#13;
    labor programs and in context or decentralization and country reform agendas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   Continued demand for to share operational experiences and knowledge, especially&#13;
    in the context of strengthening administrative mechanisms for identifying and&#13;
    selecting target populations e.g. single registry systems, targeting instruments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   More programmatic and strategic use of knowledge services, with greater selectivity&#13;
    of analytical work and sustained demand for learning and knowledge exchange&#13;
    opportunities. In this context a greater emphasis also on open data and information&#13;
    availability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   Strengthened monitoring and evaluation at the outset of a project in order to&#13;
    provide more timely information and to better understand the causal impacts&#13;
    through which safety nets are shaping outcomes. The impact evaluation agenda&#13;
    points to a series of empirical gaps including long term impacts, cost effectiveness&#13;
    and behavioral pathways of change.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   Greater emphasis on managing risk in the portfolio, especially in the context of&#13;
    general governance and accountability challenges that face safety net operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           88&#13;
&amp;#12;ï&#130;·   A need for greater external engagement with the international community and&#13;
    donor agencies, especially to support efforts towards greater safety net and social&#13;
    protection systemization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   Continued reliance on donor and trust fund resources to create flexibility&#13;

&amp;#12;Abstract&#13;
&#13;
This review examines World Bank support to social safety nets between FY07â&#128;&#147;FY13, including&#13;
both financing and knowledge services. During this time period World Bank financing for&#13;
safety nets totaled just over US$12 billion, 273 financing activities in 93 countries, the&#13;
World Bank spent approximately US$118 million on 281 safety net studies and supported&#13;
approximately 129 credible safety net impact evaluations covering in 24 countries. Among the&#13;
93 countries represented in the portfolio, 42 received little or no safety net support from the&#13;
World Bank prior to fiscal year 2007. The growth in Bank support is especially notable during&#13;
the period of the food, fuel, and financial crises. The analysis delves into these trends by&#13;
region, type of intervention and instruments involved. Finally, it delineates implications and&#13;
outlook for the future based on lessons learned, results measured and evaluative evidence.&#13;
