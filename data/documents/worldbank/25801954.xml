ANNEX 1&#13;
Description of Activities and Expenditures under the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for&#13;
the Global Financing Facility (GFF) in Support of Every Woman Every Child&#13;
1.     Overview&#13;
This Trust Fund's goal is to contribute to the global efforts to end preventable maternal, newborn, child and&#13;
adolescent deaths, and improve the health and quality of life of women, adolescents and children through&#13;
mobilizing and channeling additional international aid and domestic resources required to scale up and sustain&#13;
efficient and equitable delivery of quality reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health&#13;
(RMNCAH) services.&#13;
2.     Program Description&#13;
The Program to be funded by this Trust Fund is expected to cover a period of time up until 2022 and will&#13;
support smart, scaled and sustainable financing mechanisms designed to achieve and measure RMNCAH&#13;
results.&#13;
The Trust Fund overall objective is to support results-focused financing for achieving RMNCAH results,&#13;
including the systems - particularly civil registration and vital statistics - needed to monitor progress and&#13;
measure results. The Trust Fund will finance activities to ensure access to basic health services using a variety&#13;
of mechanisms, including results-based financing (RBF). Such mechanisms may include performance-based&#13;
payments for health service delivery, capitation payments and other forms of cash transfers to beneficiaries to&#13;
facilitate their access to such services, etc. Their use will be determined on a case by case basis in accordance&#13;
with the particular design of the project and the capacity of the Recipient countries. To that end, Recipients&#13;
of grants may need to develop "unit costs" associated with the packages of health services to be provided, in&#13;
order to facilitate disbursements.&#13;
Each country will develop an "Investment Case" and a health financing strategy to support the achievement&#13;
of the RMNCAH goals. The Investment Case will include activities to improve RMNCAH, using a variety&#13;
of mechanisms, including RBF, as well as building the necessary multi-sectoral civil registration and vital&#13;
statistics (CRVS) systems to record and track essential data. A special emphasis will be given to countries to&#13;
develop longer-term financial strategies to increase the sustainability of RMNCAH financing and the Global&#13;
Public Goods knowledge.&#13;
The specific aims of the Trust Fund are:&#13;
(i)    to support financing of comprehensive country RMNCAH investment plans;&#13;
(ii)  to support countries in the transition toward sustainable domestic financing for RMNCAH;&#13;
(iii)  to finance the strengthening of civil registration and vital statistics systems;&#13;
(iv)   to contribute to a better-coordinated and streamlined RMNCAH financing architecture;&#13;
(v)    to support design, implementation and evaluation of GFF mechanisms;&#13;
(vi)   to develop and disseminate the evidence base for implementing successful GFF mechanisms;&#13;
(vii)  to build country institutional capacity to scale-up and sustain the GFF mechanisms, within the&#13;
national health strategy and system; and&#13;
(viii)  to attract additional funding to the health sector;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-5-&#13;
3.     Activities to be Financed&#13;
Activities to be financed are set out below. Allocation levels included below are indicative only, and are&#13;
subject to change as the overall Program progresses.&#13;
Activity 1:  GFF Preparation&#13;
Activity 1 (a): RMNCAH Investment Case Grants (Bank and Recipient)&#13;
Up to $500,000 will be made available for the preparation of the GFF Investment Case and feasibility&#13;
studies, which will, inter alia, outline the desired health outcomes, the target RMNCAH outputs, the most&#13;
cost-effective health interventions to achieve these outputs, and support rigorous analysis of data and robust&#13;
resource mapping, as well as inclusive stakeholder consultations to identify and prioritize the interventions&#13;
that set a country on a course to achieving its long-term RMNCAH targets.&#13;
Activity 1 (b): GFF Seed Grants (Bank and Recipient)&#13;
Seed funds between US$50,000 to US$200,000 may be provided to Recipients or Bank teams to commission&#13;
studies, hire consultants, and support other activities to assess the value and feasibility of GFF mechanisms&#13;
for a country.&#13;
Activity 2:  Design of GFF Projects or Project Components (Recipient)&#13;
Preparation funds up to US$500,000 will be provided to Recipients to design and implement a GFF project&#13;
or project component in accordance with standard Bank fiduciary and safeguard requirements. These&#13;
funds may be used by Recipients to commission studies, hire consultants, and support other costs&#13;
associated with the design of the GFF project or project component.&#13;
Activity 3:  Preparation and Appraisal of GFF Projects or Project Components (Bank)&#13;
Funds up to US$350,000 will be provided to Bank teams to support preparation and appraisal of a GFF&#13;
project or project component, ensuring linkages and integration of the Bank-financed project or project&#13;
component with the Investment Case. Project appraisal is a stage in the project cycle which follows&#13;
completion of project preparation, the final process by which the Bank determines the suitability of a&#13;
project for Bank financing. It provides a comprehensive review of all aspects of the project, lays the&#13;
foundation for its implementation after it has been approved for Bank financing, and for evaluation when&#13;
completed.&#13;
Activity 4:  Implementation&#13;
Activity 4 (a): Implementation of Bank GFF Projects or Project Components (Recipient)&#13;
Overall responsibility for implementation lies with the Recipient country.&#13;
Grants will be made available to Recipients for implementation. Grant Agreements will be signed&#13;
between the Bank and the Recipients to reflect the funding amount and conditions of funds release based&#13;
on the specific design of the project or project component. It is expected that Recipient countries will&#13;
require significant support (e.g., technical assistance) to design and strengthen systems to achieve&#13;
improved results and implement the GFF projects or project components. A key issue is the independent&#13;
validation of data related to incentives. Such data should be based on population surveys or other methods&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-6-&#13;
that independently verify services and results, particularly civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS)&#13;
systems.&#13;
Development Policy Financing (DPFs) (Recipient)&#13;
Grants to support Recipient country reforms through non-earmarked general budget financing (known in&#13;
the Bank as development policy financing (DPF) will also be financed by this Trust Fund under this&#13;
Activity 4. These Grants will be subject to the Recipient's own implementation processes and systems.&#13;
The DPF should be supportive of programs of policy and institutional actions in the health sector which&#13;
create an enabling environment to move from a system of health delivery that finances inputs to a system&#13;
that finances and carefully monitors results in health outputs. DPFs are governed by the Bank's&#13;
Operational Policy/Bank Procedure (OP/BP 8.60) and their use is determined by the respective Country&#13;
Partnership Framework.&#13;
Progress in program implementation and its outcomes are monitored by the Recipient country and the Bank&#13;
throughout the implementation phase to obtain data to evaluate and measure the ultimate effectiveness of the&#13;
operation in terms of results.&#13;
Activity 4b:  Implementation of Recipient-executed GFF   Projects or Project Components&#13;
(Recipient)&#13;
Stand-alone grants will be made to different Recipients (member countries, NGOs, Regional Banks, etc.)&#13;
for implementation of GFF projects or project components. NGOs can be grant Recipients with the&#13;
consent of the Recipient Government. Grant Agreements will be prepared between the Bank and these&#13;
Recipients to reflect the funding amount and conditions of funds release based on the specific design of&#13;
the GFF project or project component. Similar validation of data related to incentives, as described in&#13;
Activity 4a, will be required. The Bank will have an operational role for these Grants, including appraisal&#13;
and supervision of funded activities. The Grants' execution will be subject to Bank's policies, rules, and&#13;
procedures.&#13;
Activity 5:  Supervision of Bank and Recipient-executed GFF Projects and Project Components&#13;
(Bank)&#13;
Bank teams will supervise the GFF project or project component following standard Bank procedures.&#13;
Supervision should, as much as possible, be carried out in close collaboration with partners, and aligned&#13;
with national health sector reviews where possible.&#13;
Activity 6:  Monitoring and Documentation of Bank and Recipient-executed GFF Projects and&#13;
Project Components (Bank)&#13;
Bank teams will monitor experiences in designing and implementing the GFF project or project component as&#13;
well as the Bank operational experience in preparing and appraising the GFF project or project component.&#13;
Such monitoring aims to identify operational and other issues, which can be addressed by corrective actions.&#13;
In addition, monitoring can contribute to the learning of lessons on why GFF projects or project components&#13;
may or may not achieve their objectives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-7-&#13;
Activity 7:  Knowledge and Learning (Bank)&#13;
Activity 7 (a): Evaluation of Bank and GFF Recipient-executed Projects and Project Components&#13;
The Bank will evaluate the results of the GFF projects or project components financed by this Trust Fund. The&#13;
evaluations will be designed to answer the question of whether the GFF project or project component was&#13;
associated with or led to the achievement of results in each project site.&#13;
Activity 7 (b): Strengthening the Knowledge Base&#13;
The Bank will allocate on competitive basis grants for operational research and evaluation which will be&#13;
aimed at assessing the impact of RMNCAH and health financing interventions.&#13;
Activity 7 (c): Development of Global Public Goods&#13;
The Bank will develop and deploy Global Public Goods (GPGs) in order to accelerate the affordability and&#13;
accessibility of RMNCAH services.&#13;
Activity 8:  Dissemination and Knowledge Sharing (Bank)&#13;
GFF experiences and lessons learned will be shared through the GFF website supported by the Trust Fund,&#13;
and through meetings, country dialogue, workshops, and case studies.&#13;
Activity 9:  Trust Fund Management and Administration (Bank)&#13;
A team of Bank staff and reporting to Bank management, headed by a designated Program Manager, will&#13;
support the management and administration of the Trust Fund. The Trust Fund will finance activities of&#13;
the Bank team related to the organization of the Annual Consultation meetings and any other additional&#13;
coordination with Donors and partners, oversight of the overall Program, coordination with country-&#13;
specific Task Team Leaders, development and consolidation of annual and semi -annual reports to Donors,&#13;
etc.&#13;
Other Activities:   Buy-downs and Buy-ups (Recipient)&#13;
The possibility of using instruments such as buy-downs and buy-ups will also be considered. Buy-downs&#13;
involve the provision by Donors of committed funding to 'buy-down', or pay for all, or part of a Bank&#13;
loan/credit on behalf of the government, once results are achieved. Buy-ups support IDA countries that&#13;
receive grant financing, whereby additional Donor financing is provided based on results. Trust Fund&#13;
Donors will receive from the Bank a proposal covering the rationale for buy-downs and buy-ups, and&#13;
other approaches that can leverage additional resources and incentivize performance for the national&#13;
health sector. No more than two-fifths of new contributions to the Trust Fund (post November 2009) may&#13;
be used for buy-downs and buy-ups.&#13;
4.     Categories of Expenditure&#13;
For Bank-executed activities: Contribution funds will be used to finance the following categories of&#13;
expenditure: Staff Costs (salaries, benefits, and indirects), Extended Term Consultants, Consultants Fees,&#13;
Contractual Services, Travel Expenses, Media and Workshops/Conferences/Meetings, Associated Overheads,&#13;
and Temporary Staff Costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-8-&#13;
For Recipient-executed activities: at the Bank's discretion, funds may be allocated for the purpose&#13;
of financing either:&#13;
(i)    Standard Grants with specific activities and allowable expenses pre-determined, in which&#13;
case, Contribution funds may be used to finance Services, Goods, Works and Incremental&#13;
Operating Costs; or&#13;
(ii)   Recipient country reforms through non-earmarked general budget financing, in which case,&#13;
Contribution funds may be used for any general budgetary needs.&#13;
For purposes of this Agreement:&#13;
"Incremental Operating Costs" means incremental expenses incurred on account of project&#13;
implementation and management, including the operation and maintenance of vehicles, office&#13;
supplies, communication charges, insurance costs, office administration costs, banking charges, utility&#13;
charges, rental charges, domestic/international travel and per diem allowance."&#13;

the Global Financing Facility (GFF) in Support of Every Woman Every Child&#13;
1.     Country and Project Selection&#13;
Criteria set out in the Business Plan of the GFF endorsed by the Bank and the Trust Fund Donors will be used&#13;
to identify countries to be supported through the Trust Fund. After countries have been identified in&#13;
consultation with Donors, the Bank will work with countries and other eligible recipients to design GFF&#13;
projects or project components and make the final decisions in the allocation of funds.&#13;
2.      Project Preparation. Appraisal and Supervision&#13;
The Donors will rely upon the Bank's rules and procedures for project preparation, appraisal and supervision.&#13;
2.1.   Sr. Director, World Bank Health Nutrition and Population Global Practice (HNP GP): the&#13;
oversight of the Program will be the responsibility of the Sr. Director of HNP GP.&#13;
2.2.   Trust Fund Program Management: day-to-day management of the overall Trust Fund will be the&#13;
responsibility of the GFF Program Manager, who will lead the GFF Secretariat located in Washington, DC, at&#13;
the Bank's headquarters. The Secretariat is comprised of staff employed by the Bank and secondments from&#13;
participating organizations. The Secretariat operates under Bank's management and applicable Bank's&#13;
policies and procedures and is also accountable to the GFF Trust Fund Committee and the GFF Investors&#13;
Group.&#13;
2.3.   GFF Project or Project Component -- Task Team Leader: each of the GFF projects or project&#13;
components will be managed by a TTL, who will be responsible for appraisal and supervision of the&#13;
respective GFF project or project component, as described in paragraph 3.3 of the Annex 1.&#13;
2.4.   Recipients: the Recipients will be responsible for designing and implementing the GFF project&#13;
or project component. Support from the Trust Fund for GFF projects or project components will be reviewed&#13;
and, where possible, incorporated into the Medium Term Expenditure Framework to help ensure&#13;
sustainability. As in all Bank projects, the Recipients will be expected to coordinate the effort with all relevant&#13;
development actors.&#13;
3.     Coordination with Donors&#13;
3.1.   Annual Consultation Meeting: representatives from the Donors, organized as the Trust Fund&#13;
Committee, and the Bank will meet at least once a year after submission of the annual report. The role&#13;
of the Trust Fund Committee is to ensure that the GFF Trust Fund mobilizes and uses its resources in a way&#13;
that optimally supports the mission of the GFF. The Trust Fund Committee will be composed of all original&#13;
and subsequent contributing Donors to the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2    Key subjects to be discussed during the annual consultations include key achievements throughout&#13;
the year, identification of any issues, and proposed mitigation, which may affect program effectiveness; a&#13;
qualitative assessment of progress against the indicators at the country level set forth in the GFF results&#13;
framework and referred to in paragraph 7.1 of Annex 2 to this Agreement and based on available information&#13;
generated by the GFF projects or project components (e.g., verification mechanisms, impact evaluations) and&#13;
in particular:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-14-&#13;
*  Assessment of the Trust Fund performance and budget execution.&#13;
*  Strategic directions for the Trust Fund and the proposed annual work plan.&#13;
*  Preliminary annual allocations for the Trust Fund.&#13;
*  Review and assessment of criteria used to identify countries for support under the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.3    The results of the meeting will be recorded in Agreed Minutes. The Agreed Minutes will be drafted&#13;
by the Bank and sent to all Donors for their approval/comments within two weeks after the meeting. The&#13;
Donors will inform the Bank of their approval/comments within seven days of receipt of the draft, after which&#13;
the final draft will be provided by the Bank for record keeping.&#13;
3.4    Additional consultation meetings may be requested by the Bank and/or a/the Donor(s).&#13;

agenda with the purpose to mobilize institutional support and expertise at the global level in order to optimally&#13;
support efficient collective action at the country level. The Investors Group will meet at least once a year and&#13;
will also provide a platform for continuous dialogue to increase transparency, mutual learning and&#13;
accountability amongst the institutions with significant investments in RMNCAH, including the Bank and the&#13;
Donors of the GFF Trust Fund.&#13;
4.     Independent  External Evaluation  of  the   Trust  Fund: Implementing   appropriate&#13;
systems to review project operations and progress against the objectives of the Trust Fund will be&#13;
important. The Donors will finance and carry out independent external evaluations of the Trust Fund, to&#13;
take place in 2016 with a final evaluation in 2022. The evaluations will be undertaken by the Donors in&#13;
accordance with section 7.2 of Annex 2 of this Agreement and based on Terms of Reference developed&#13;
by the Donors at least one year prior, and agreed with the Bank.&#13;
