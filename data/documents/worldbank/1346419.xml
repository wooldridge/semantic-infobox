        <abstracts>
            During the 1990s developing countries
            increasingly turned to the private sector for construction,
            management, and maintenance of toll roads. Between 1990 and
            1999, US$61 billion of private investment was committed to
            279 projects in 26 developing countries, comprising 34,369
            kilometers of toll highways, bridges and tunnels. This Note
            analyzes the main trends in private participation in toll
            roads in developing countries using figures from the World
            Bank's Private Participation in Infrastructure Project Database.
