ï»¿ANNEX 2&#13;
Standard Provisions&#13;
This Annex will be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Agreements between the Bank&#13;
and the respective Donors. Donors must contribute a minimum of one million United States Dollars (or the&#13;
equivalent) to the Trust Fund.&#13;
1.     Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1   The Bank will be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in this&#13;
Administration Agreement and will not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors, including,&#13;
without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee under general&#13;
principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement will be considered a waiver of&#13;
any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any applicable law, all of which are&#13;
expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2   Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") will be administered in accordance with&#13;
the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from time to time, including its&#13;
procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its framework to prevent and combat&#13;
fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources to finance terrorist&#13;
activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the Security Council taken&#13;
under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this provision does&#13;
not create any obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules&#13;
and executive orders of an individual member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be accounted for as a single trust fund and will be kept&#13;
separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be commingled with&#13;
other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as trustee, has legal title to the funds&#13;
deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2    The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund will be held is United States Dollars (the "Holding&#13;
Currency").&#13;
2.3    Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their respective&#13;
Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency other than the Holding&#13;
Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit Instructions, the Bank will&#13;
convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the&#13;
conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a result of exchange rate&#13;
fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor will bear any responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies as&#13;
may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion.&#13;
2.5    The Bank will invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their disbursement in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment of trust funds administered by&#13;
the Bank. The Bank will credit all income from such investment to the Trust Fund to be used for the same&#13;
purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿3.     Trust Fund Fees&#13;
3.1    The Bank will deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each Installment, an amount&#13;
equal to two percent (2%) per Installment as an administrative fee for the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2    Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust Fund Fees&#13;
section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual Contributions significantly differ from&#13;
what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the first Administration Agreement, or if other&#13;
circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right to request a change to the&#13;
terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by amendments made to the&#13;
Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable to all new Contributions&#13;
that are provided either as amendments to supplement existing Administration Agreements or from new Donors&#13;
under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
4.     Accounting and Financial Reporting&#13;
4.1    The Bank will maintain separate records and ledger accounts in respect of the funds deposited in the&#13;
Trust Fund and disbursements made therefrom.&#13;
4.2    The Bank will furnish to the Donors current financial information relating to receipts, disbursements&#13;
and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions via the World Bank's Trust Funds&#13;
Donor Center secure website. Within six (6) months after all commitments and liabilities under the Trust Fund&#13;
have been satisfied and the Trust Fund has been closed, the final financial information relating to receipts,&#13;
disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions will be made available&#13;
to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website.&#13;
4.3    The Bank will provide to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Fund Donor Center secure website,&#13;
within six (6) months following the end of each Bank fiscal year, an annual single audit report, comprising (i) a&#13;
management assertion together with an attestation from the Bank's external auditors concerning the adequacy&#13;
of internal control over cash-based financial reporting for all cash-based trust funds as a whole; and (ii) a&#13;
combined financial statement for all cash-based trust funds together with the Bank's external auditor's opinion&#13;
thereon. The cost of the single audit will be borne by the Bank.&#13;
4.4   If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the Bank's external&#13;
auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank will first consult as to whether such an external audit is&#13;
necessary. If such an audit is agreed to be necessary and if all donors to the Trust Fund concur with the relevant&#13;
Donor's request for such an audit, the Bank and the Donor will agree on the appropriate scope and terms of&#13;
reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank will arrange for&#13;
such external audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal costs of the Bank with respect to such&#13;
audit, will be borne by the requesting Donor.&#13;

to the Donors a final report on the activities financed by the Trust Fund.&#13;
5.2    Any Donor may review or evaluate activities financed by the Trust Fund at any time up to six (6) months&#13;
following the End Disbursement Date. The Donor and the Bank will agree on the scope and conduct of such&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿review or evaluation, and the Bank will provide all relevant information within the limits of the Bank's&#13;
applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including any costs incurred by the Bank, will be borne&#13;
by the Donor. It is understood that any such review or evaluation will not constitute a financial, compliance or&#13;
other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;
6.     Disbursement; Cancellation; Refund&#13;
6.1   It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the Bank by September&#13;
30, 2021 (the "End Disbursement Date"). The Bank will only disburse funds deposited in the Trust Fund for&#13;
the purposes of this Administration Agreement (other than returns to Donors) after such date to the extent such&#13;
date is changed in accordance with amendment made to the Administration Agreements of all the Donors.&#13;
Following the End Disbursement Date, the Bank will return any remaining balance of the Trust Fund to each&#13;
Donor in the Holding Currency in the manner specified in its respective Administration Agreement on a pro rata&#13;
basis with regard to the total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by such Donor relative to the total funds deposited&#13;
in the Trust Fund by all Donors, all calculated as Holding Currency amounts.&#13;
6.2    Any Donor may cancel all or part of such Donor's pro rata share, and the Bank may cancel all or any&#13;
Donors' pro rata shares, upon three (3) months' prior written notice, of any Contributions (paid and not yet paid)&#13;
that are not committed pursuant to any agreement entered into between the Bank and any consultants and/or&#13;
other third parties for the purposes of this Administration Agreement, including any Grant Agreement, prior to&#13;
the receipt of such notice. In the event of a cancellation, the Bank will return to the Donor its pro-rata share in&#13;
the Holding Currency as specified in the Administration Agreement, unless otherwise agreed between the Bank&#13;
and the Donor.&#13;
7.     Disclosure; Dispute Resolution&#13;
7.1    The Bank will disclose the Administration Agreements and related information on this Trust Fund in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Policy on Access to Information. By entering into Administration Agreements, the&#13;
Donors consent to such disclosure of their respective Administration Agreements and such related information.&#13;
7.2    The Donors and the Bank will use their best efforts to amicably settle any dispute, controversy, or claim&#13;
arising out of or relating to the Administration Agreements.&#13;
8.     Grants to Recipients&#13;
8.1    The Bank will, as administrator of the Trust Fund on behalf of the Donors, enter into one or more grant&#13;
agreements (the "Grant Agreement") with recipients (the "Recipients") for Recipient-executed activities&#13;
consistent with the purposes of this Administration Agreement and on the terms and conditions set forth in the&#13;
Grant Agreements. Grant Agreements may be entered into up to the maximum amount of the Contributions that&#13;
all Donors have agreed to make available under the Administration Agreements between the Bank and the&#13;
