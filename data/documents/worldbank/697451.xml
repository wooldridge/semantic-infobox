SEED SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Project Origin&#13;
1. 1    The Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE) requested IDA assistance in financing the proposed Seed&#13;
Systems Development Project. as a part of its efforts to modernize the agriculture sector. and alleviate growing&#13;
food security concerns. The Project was appraised in February/March 1992 and re-appraised in July/August 1994.&#13;
B. The Macro Setting&#13;
1.2    Ethiopia, with a population of 54.8 million, is Sub-Saharan Africa's second most populous country. Its&#13;
social indicators are among the lowest in the world: very low per capita GNP of US$125 per year, high infant&#13;
mortality rate of 122 per 1,000 live births, mortality rate of over 20 percent for children under five, and growing&#13;
chronic protein energy malnutrition. According to TGE's Rural Nutrition survey (1992), 64 percent of the children&#13;
are stunted and 47 percent are underweight. Only 17 percent of the children complete four years of primary school&#13;
against the regional and global averages of 48 and 68 percent. respectively.&#13;
1.3    Some 60 percent of the urban population lives below the poverty level. The estimated average per capita&#13;
calorie intake is below 80 percent of the level considered necessary for a healthy life. The country's structural food&#13;
deficit, presently estimated to be around one million tons. is anticipated to grow steadily, unless specific actions are&#13;
taken, aimed at improving productivity in the primarv agricultural sector. In the last two decades, annual&#13;
population growth averaged about 3 percent, and is projected in the 1993 World Development Report at 2.7&#13;
percent until the turn of the century.&#13;
1.4    The country suffers from severe port and transport capacity constraints. With Eritrea's independence in&#13;
May 1993, Ethiopia lost its two ports, Assab and Massawa, and became landlocked. Although an agreement&#13;
between the two countries (July 1993) provides Ethiopia an unhindered access to Assab and Massawa, the severe&#13;
capacity constraints are not likely to permit a significant increase in dry cargo (food and fertilizer) imports. In&#13;
addition. there are serious transportation constraints aggravated by the inadequacy and poor state of its roads.&#13;
Ethiopia's road density is among the lowest in Africa, standing at 20 km per 1,000 km sq. and 0.4 km per 1,000&#13;
population. Some 80 percent of Ethiopians depend on traditional means of transport, such as walking, carrying&#13;
their goods on the back and head, on pack animals and, to a lesser extent, on animal drawn carts. Household food&#13;
security, in dispersed, difficult to reach and mountainous locations, where much of the population resides, is a&#13;
matter of growing concern.&#13;
1.5    The Ethiopian political and economic structures have been subject to repeated and profound changes&#13;
during the past two decades. The 1974 revolution ended an era of monarchy and feudalism; it replaced market&#13;
mechanisms with state planning and controls over investment, production and trade, stifled private&#13;
entrepreneurship, and diverted resources to the conduct of civil war, which virtually crippled the economy. The&#13;
socialist military regime was defeated in May 1991, and a National Conference, comprising a coalition of 29&#13;
parties, ethnic and linguistic groups, installed a Transitional Government (TGE) in June 1991. TGE is in the&#13;
process of introducing new economic and administrative structures and a democratic political system.&#13;
1.6    Market-oriented Economic System: In November 1991, TGE announced Ethiopia's Economic Policy&#13;
during the Transitional Period, which signaled a move away from the centrally planned economy towards a more&#13;
liberal, market oriented and decentralized economic system, in which private, rather than collective, ownership&#13;
would dominate most sectors of the economy and efficiency would be stimulated by competition and increased&#13;
international openness. In the meantime, to jump-start the economy, an Emergency Recovery and Reconstruction&#13;
Project (ERRP), Cr. 2351-ET, was launched in July 1992 in cooperation with other donors, involving a total&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
provision of about US$650 million to be disbursed in two and half years. ERRP, due to close in September 1995.&#13;
has been satisfactorily implemented.&#13;
1.7    TGE's first phase of economic reform aimed at increasing domestic resource mobilization, reducing the&#13;
fiscal deficit, correcting price distortions, and reducing the external account deficit. The most significant reform&#13;
was a 59 percent devaluation of the Birr (in US dollars terms) in October 1992 and the introduction of a limited bi-&#13;
weekly foreign exchange auction system in May 1993--a move towards a market-determined rate of exchange.&#13;
Other important reforms are aimed at improving incentives for production, competitiveness of markets, and private&#13;
sector performance. These efforts have been supported by a Structural Adjustment Credit (Cr. 2526-ET) funded by&#13;
IDA and other donors. TGE has also reached agreements with the Bank and IMF on the next phase of reform&#13;
presented in the Third Policy Framework Paper negotiated in September 1994 for the period 1994-95 to 1996-97.&#13;
A public expenditure review (1994) by IDA confirms TGE commitment to a policy which shifts the weight of&#13;
investment, and management of the productive sectors, from the state to the private sectors. The economy has&#13;
responded positively to these reforms. Real GDP grew by 12.3 percent in FY93, compared to a -3.2 percent in&#13;
FY92. Exports increased sharply, balance of payments improved, and foreign exchange reserves have increased,&#13;
whereas the gap between the official foreign exchange auction rate and parallel rate has narrowed to less than 15&#13;
percent. Domestic inflation decreased to less than 10 percent from an average of 15.7 percent in the preceding&#13;
three years, and is now projected at about 5 percent per year after FY95.&#13;
1.8    Decentralized Administrative System: In order to provide a sound basis for grass roots economic&#13;
growth with the people's participation. TGE had divided the country into 14 regions; however, the newly adopted&#13;
constitution by the Constituent Assembly divides the country into nine states. namely Tigray, Afar, Amhara,&#13;
Oromia, Somali, Benishangul, Southern Nation, Gambella and Harrar.  These state governments will have&#13;
legislative, executive and judicial powers in respect to all matters within their geographical areas except certain&#13;
subjects where the Central Government alone would have power. In order to implement the new arrangements, a&#13;
massive shift of staff from the Central Government to various regions is under way.&#13;
1.9    Such simultaneous handling of profound systemic changes in the economic, political, administrative and&#13;
institutional structures of Ethiopia is an effort of unprecedented magnitude. Inevitably, it will take time to fully&#13;
establish effective organizational structures and functional relationships to sustain a high level of economic&#13;
performance in a democratic political environment.&#13;
C. The Agricultural Sector&#13;
1.10    Sectoral Contribution: The agriculture sector is the leading sector in the Ethiopian economy; it accounts&#13;
for 55 percent of GDP at factor costs, employs 80 percent of the labor force, generates 60 percent of commodity&#13;
export earnings., in which coffee alone accounts for 60 percent, and provides raw materials for 70 percent of the&#13;
country;s large and medium-sized industries that are agro-based. Crop production is estimated to contribute&#13;
around 60 percent, livestock around 30 percent, and forestry and other sectors around 10 percent of the total&#13;
sectoral output. Over six million (estimated) smallholders, cultivating about six to seven million hectares of land,&#13;
follow a traditional, low input-low output rainfed farming technology and account for about 96 percent of&#13;
agricultural output., including 98 percent of the coffee. The balance is produced on state farms and by other public&#13;
agricultural enterprises. Depending on the crop situation, only about 20 to 30 percent of the cereal production&#13;
comes to the local market.&#13;
1.11    Sectoral Performance: The performance of the agriculture sector in the last two decades has been poor.&#13;
While the economy grew at 2.2 percent during the last 18 years, the annual agricultural growth averaged around&#13;
only 1I.1 percent. The area under crops, as well as the overall production, has remained stagnant for several years,&#13;
barring certain exceptional years like 1983 and 1989. Crop productivity has also remained low at average per&#13;
hectare yields of 1.2 tons for food grains, 0.6 tons for pulses and 0.5 tons for oilseeds, compared to relatively much&#13;
higher yields (more than double in many cases) obtained at research stations and in demonstrations conducted at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
farm level. As a result, barring the exceptional year of 1983, the country has been a net importer of foodgrains&#13;
since 1981. The level of foodgrain imports required to meet the country's deficit rose from three percent of the&#13;
total grain consumption in the early 1980s to about 10 percent in 1990.  In addition, according to Central&#13;
Statistical Authority (CSA) 1989 Agricultural Sample Survey, 46.7 percent of 6.09 million households (excluding&#13;
Eritrea, Tigray, Assab and Ogaden region) have holdings which average less than 0.5 ha each; cumulatively 72.1&#13;
percent have holdings less than one hectare (average size of holding being 0.73 ha) Further, assuming a family&#13;
size of five and normal cereal productivity, a tqpical farm household may need about 0.75 ha of land to obtain a&#13;
food supply of about 0.9 tons per annum to stay above the absolute poverty line. Based on this criteria, over 60&#13;
percent of the rural households may be in absolute poverty.&#13;
1.12 Other Causes of Poor Sectoral Performance: These include: (a) inadequate research and extension&#13;
support; (b) virtual stagnation of crop production technology at primitive levels, except very limited introduction of&#13;
modern inputs like fertilizer, and to a very limited extent, seeds of improved varieties; (c) recurrent droughts,&#13;
limited area under irrigation (less than three percent of the total area) despite significant potential; and (d)&#13;
declining soil fertility due to overgrazing, reduced fallow, and very rapid deforestation (from 16 percent in the&#13;
early 1950s to only 2.7 percent in 1989). Even though some useful work has been done by the Ethiopian&#13;
agricultural research system in the development and release of improved crop varieties, farmers' access to seeds of&#13;
genetically superior varieties remains very poor. In fact, a recent meeting of international agricultural research&#13;
centers with the World Bank (October 1994) came to the conclusion that the most critical constraint to widespread&#13;
adoption of improved technologies, particularly the disease-resistant, high yielding varieties, was the poor capacity&#13;
within the country for producing and multiplying the improved seeds or planting materials.&#13;
1.13    Source of Growth:  TGE's recent agricultural strategy identifies two main sources of growth in&#13;
agricultural output: (a) increase in smallholder crop productivitv, and (b) area expansion through (i) extensive&#13;
mechanized farming; and (ii) intensive commercial agriculture.&#13;
1.14    Area Expansion: The scope of increasing area under crops in the central highlands, where much of&#13;
agriculture is currently practiced, is severely limited due to growing population pressure combined with the largest&#13;
livestock herd in Africa. Land scarcity has led to the increase of cropped area at the expense of both fallow and&#13;
grazing, with crops being grown on more marginal, steep and poorly drained lands which are susceptible to&#13;
erosion. It would, therefore, be necessary for cropped area expanslon to move to lower elevations, mostly in the&#13;
west and south of the country where population density is much lower. However, this would entail considerable&#13;
amount of lead time and investment, as these areas are generally: (a) uninhabited or have sparse population;&#13;
(b) malaria infested and tsetse fly infested; (c) lacking in minimum infrastructure like roads, clinics, banks,&#13;
electricity, potable water, schools, telecommunications; and (d) deprived of access to cheap labor due to absence of&#13;
housing and other facilities. Further, the environmental impact of sudden opening of large areas of land combined&#13;
with new human settlements would need careful study. The sociological aspects of settling people in other regions&#13;
would also need to be addressed. Area expansion would, therefore, be only a medium to long-term option and&#13;
would not significantly address the problem of rising food shortages in the next few years.&#13;
1.15    Yield Enhancement: The only available short term alternative to meet the critical need for increased&#13;
foodgrains production is by increasing land productivity. There are several mutually reinforcing ways of achieving&#13;
enhanced productivity levels in agriculture. These include widespread use of improved seeds, better cultural&#13;
practices, site-specific solutions to low productivity through intensive research and extension work, minimization&#13;
of post harvest losses, greater and more efficient use of chemical and organic fertilizers, and more efficient pest&#13;
management techniques. However, given the current situation in Ethiopia, under which: (a) the entire public&#13;
administration system is being revamped; (b) the agricultural research and extension system is being reviewed for&#13;
thorough reform; (c) work on site-specific crop productivity problems is yet to commence; (d) the domestic&#13;
manufacture and commercial sale of improved agricultural implements and thrashers has not commenced; (e) the&#13;
important institution of rural cooperatives needs to be virtually re-created under the new cooperative law; (f) the&#13;
Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB) and the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE), the two&#13;
primary institutions for rural credit, are being restructured and re-capitalized; and (g) the state farms, mainly&#13;
responsible for limited seed production, are being downsized and commercialized, it would be difficult to expect&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
synergistic contributions from several of these options at least for the next few years. Nevertheless, it is possible to&#13;
begin with some specific initiatives which would progressively draw support from the above-mentioned&#13;
institutional and other improvements.&#13;
1.16    Figure I in the section on Annexes depicts a 20-year scenario of food production and consumption needs&#13;
from 1974 to 1994. The country's food deficit which started in 1981 is now around one million tons of foodgrains&#13;
per year. What is of greater concern is the projection that by 1999, Ethiopian's gross foodgrains requirement will&#13;
increase by 2.35 million tons over the 1994 estimated levels. In this context, it would be prudent for the&#13;
Government to launch some basic initiatives to provide agriculture support services to farmers, which would&#13;
include adequate and satisfactory input supplies of seeds and fertilizer, combined with a strengthened extension&#13;
service. The Government is already working in this direction. A task force set up in August 1994, is exploring&#13;
ways of (a) upgrading the skills of extension agents through well-focused training programs; and (b) ensuring&#13;
timely and adequate supplies of agricultural inputs-particularly improved seeds and fertilizers-to the farmers.&#13;
D. IDA's Agricultural Portfolio and Future Strategy&#13;
1.17    IDA's Existing Portfolio: IDA's existing agricultural portfolio is rather thin, and comprises two Projects&#13;
only. One project in agricultural research and one project in forestry have closed in June 1994, while one in&#13;
livestock closed in December of 1994. There has been no new IDA lending for the agriculture sector since 1989.&#13;
IDA efforts have mainly concentrated on policy dialogue, sector work (in areas of food security, poverty alleviation&#13;
and forestry sector) and the strengthening of the future pipeline. Since TGE came into office in mid-1991, the&#13;
Bank has reviewed ongoing operations with a view to restructuring projects established under the previous regime,&#13;
and freeing up resources for deployment in support of speedy economic recovery operations, and in realigning the&#13;
project designs with the Governments' new economic management and development vision. IDA has also&#13;
proposed further sector work to TGE.&#13;

1.18    IDA's Lending Pipeline in the Agriculture Sector: In addition to focusing on improved implementation&#13;
of the existing portfolio, the pipeline includes one project on fertilizer sector development and one on seed systems&#13;
development, to provide an efficient input supply service to agriculture. A third, Agricultural Support Services&#13;
Project, to focus on agricultural research and extension, is under discussion with TGE; the latter project would be&#13;
the continuation and expansion of earlier efforts under the recently completed (June, 1994) Agricultural Research&#13;
Project (Cr. 1521-ET), intended to develop new technologies that can increase crop yields and ensure their&#13;
effective dissemination through a nationwide extension service. Two other Projects, namely the Bio-diversity&#13;
Conservation, and the Natural Resource Management Project, are likely to be funded by Global Eenvironment&#13;
Facility and donors, respectively.&#13;

H. THE SEED SECTOR&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
2.1    Role of Seed in Agriculture: Seed is a basic input in crop production. It is also the cheapest input in&#13;
agriculture, yet it has the most profound influence on crop yields. The productivity of a crop is directly linked to&#13;
the genetic potential of the seed used, and varies according to the use of recommended complementary inputs and&#13;
the observance of cultural practices. Further, since seed production is a biological phenomenon, it is characterized&#13;
by an inflexible time lag which is required to multiply a small quantity of breeder seed into large quantities for&#13;
commercial sale through a multi-stage production process over successive crop seasons. These stages are usually&#13;
described as pre-basic, basic and commercial seed production. Also, since seed is a living organism, subject to the&#13;
phenomena of aging, decay and death, it needs sensitive care in handling, storage and transportation. Finally,&#13;
unlike chemical fertilizers which are mass produced in large factories with built-in quality control arrangements,&#13;
seed lots, which are usually produced by numerous seed producers in different farming conditions, need to be&#13;
carefully tested for quality before they are sold in the market. The quality considerations include attention to&#13;
genetic and physical purity of a variety, presence of weed-seeds, generation (i.e.. stage of multiplication, such as&#13;
pre-basic, basic and commercial, also known as breeder, foundation and commercial respectively), germination&#13;
percentage, moisture content and the date of testing.&#13;
B. Historical Development&#13;
2.2    The Informal Seed Sector: For centuries, the Ethiopian farmers have used their own seed saved from&#13;
the previous crop, or informally obtained it from neighboring farmers, usually in exchange for grain or any other&#13;
commodity. These seeds, also described as "land races", have been going through a natural mutation process over&#13;
time to produce new genetic versions of seed varieties to fit each agro-ecological niche. Even today, some 85&#13;
percent of the Ethiopian farmers are believed to be depending upon these seeds. Though well adapted to the local&#13;
agro-ecological situations, and therefore resistant to factors like disease, insect attack or even moisture stress, "land&#13;
races" are generally low yielding when compared to modern high yielding varieties bred in agricultural research&#13;
stations which have a relatively wider adaptability in a range of environments and have a built-in responsiveness to&#13;
the application of chemical inputs like fertilizers.&#13;
2.3    The Formal Seed Sector: The formal seed sector in Ethiopia owes its origin to the establishment of the&#13;
Alemaya University of Agriculture (AUA) in the mid-fifties and the Institute of Agricultural Research (IAR) in the&#13;
mid-sixties, when these institutions started developing improved varieties of seeds for the cereal, pulses and oilseed&#13;
crops. These seeds were first introduced to the farmers in 1967 under the Swedish-assisted first minimum package&#13;
program in the Chilalo .Awraja in the Arsi zone. The Chilalo Agricultural Development Unit, popularly known as&#13;
CADU, supplied a package of inputs and services which included improved seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, credit and&#13;
extension advice to the farmers. CADU's success induced similar minimum package programs in other regions;&#13;
funding was provided by several international agencies including IDA, USAID, FAO, while the projects were&#13;
implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture's Extension and Project Implementation Department. By the mid-&#13;
1980s, it is estimated that about 21 percent of Arsi Region farmers had adopted improved variety seeds, compared&#13;
to only about 2 percent in other regions.&#13;
2.4     Ethiopian Seed Corporation: Production of improved commercial seed for cereal, legume and oilseed&#13;
crops was institutionalized in 1978 through the parastatal Ethiopian Seed Corporation (ESC); this corporation was&#13;
recently converted into the Ethiopian Seed Enterprise (ESE). The ESC was under the supervisory authority of the&#13;
Ministry of State Farms, Coffee and Tea Development, while ESE is now responsible to the Prime Minister's&#13;
Office. The main objectives of ESC were to (a) organize the production and marketing of improved seeds&#13;
developed by the IAR and other agricultural research establishments; (b) import reliable high yielding varieties;&#13;
and (c) organize seed cleaning and processing facilities at various locations. Until 1990, ESE was virtually the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
sole producer of seeds in the formal seed sector. It obtained the breeder seed from the IAR and AUA and&#13;
multiplied it into pre-basic and basic seed at its two seed farms or the farms of the IAR/AUA, and finally into&#13;
commercial seed almost exclusively at the state farms. ESE infrastructure includes a stationary seed processing&#13;
capacity of about 40,000 tons per season (with two working shifts) at four locations (Nekempt. Assela, Kofele,&#13;
Awassa) and 10,000 tons from three mobile cleaners, permanent storage capacity of 37,700 tons at eight locations,&#13;
(Nekempt, Assela, Kofele, Awassa, Bahir Dar, Assassa, Dodolla and Robe) with an additional seed reserve store&#13;
(2,000 tons) at Kombolcha. ESE also has a seed testing laboratory at Addis Ababa with a capacity to test 5,000&#13;
samples per year. During the last five years, its annual production has averaged about 12,450 tons of cleaned seed,&#13;
or 12 percent of the total potential market, estimated to be around 100,000 tons. Historically. four crops, namely,&#13;
wheat, maize, teff and barley out of 14 traded crops, comprised 80 to 90 percent of sales. Typically the state farms&#13;
would absorb some 43 percent of the seed produced, the remainder being distributed to the peasants through Non-&#13;
Governmental Organizations (NGOs) (30 percent) and Agricultural Inputs Supply Corporation (AISCO) (27&#13;
percent). In 1991, AISCO ceased to deal with seeds and ESE expanded its supplies for drought relief operations.&#13;
ESE's production planning, distribution and seed pricing was clearly subject to government regulations and policy.&#13;
Despite recent policy relaxation, private retailing of improved seeds has not vet commenced and seed quality&#13;
remains a critical issue. ESE sells uncertified seed.&#13;
2.5    In July 1990, a Joint Venture Agreement was signed between the Ethiopian Seed Corporation and Pioneer&#13;
Hi-bred International, USA to procure. produce, process. condition, distribute and sell seeds and other agricultural&#13;
products domestically, as well as in the export markets. The respective shares of the two companies are 30 and 70&#13;
percent. This joint venture has so far focused on production of hybrid seeds for maize. Lately, the joint venture&#13;
has also started the testing of sunflower and alfalfa seeds and is expected to continue with a program of adaptive&#13;
research in varieties with commercial potential.&#13;
C. Policy Framework&#13;
2.6     Policy Environment: For the first time, in October 1992, the TGE announced a National Seed Industry&#13;
Policy (NSIP) to help the country develop a healthy seed industry in line with the national economic development&#13;
policy, in which the domestic private seed enterprises would be encouraged to actively participate in the production&#13;
and distribution of improved seeds. Hitherto, the private sector had virtually no role in the production and&#13;
marketing of seeds.  The principal objectives of NSIP include: (a) ensure the collection, conservation,&#13;
documentation and utilization of the germplasm resource for future use by national research programs; (b)&#13;
streamline variety evaluation, release, registration and maintenance activities through a new organizational set-up;&#13;
(c) develop an effective system of producing and supplying high quality seeds of important crops to satisfy the&#13;
national seed requirements through active participation of both public and private sector; (d) encourage the&#13;
participation of farmers in germplasm conservation as well as seed production; (e) create a functional and efficient&#13;
organizational set-up to facilitate cooperative linkage and coordination between the various participants in the seed&#13;
industry; and (f) regulate seed quality standards, import and export, seed trade quarantine, and other seed related&#13;
issues. Further, the policy provides for the setting up of a National Seed Industry Agency (NSIA), under the&#13;
umbrella of a National Seed Industry Council (NSIC), to guide and monitor the growth of the national seed&#13;
industry along sound lines. The NSIP also seeks to define the role of the public and the private sectors in seed&#13;
industry development, promote active farmer participation, strengthen the system of seed quality control, lay down&#13;
arrangements for variety testing and release, and promote secondary seed multiplication schemes at&#13;
community/village levels, using both local and improved cultivars. Finally, unlike in the past, the NSIP requires&#13;
that the price of seed be determined by market forces. The policy is clearly cognizant of the natural resource&#13;
conservation and sustainability concerns. As a follow-up to the policy, the TGE issued a proclamation (No.&#13;
56/1993 of July 16, 1993) establishing the NSIA and NSIC to implement NSIP, and to assure the overall growth&#13;
of a broad-based seed industrv. The policy is expected to be followed by a seed legislation to regulate the industry&#13;
on a sound basis, and protect the interests of the plant breeders, distributors and farmers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
D. Current Status of the Seed Sector&#13;
2.7     Breeders Seed: IAR and AUA are the main plant breeding institutions in Ethiopia; there is as yet no&#13;
private plant breeding activity. The IAR, operating from 14 main research centers and 29 sub-centers, is the&#13;
principal plant breeding institution for cereal crops, pulses, oilseeds, cotton, potato and forage crops. The AUA.&#13;
with two centers and seven sub-centers is specializing in the improvement of teff, durum wheat, pulses, potato and&#13;
forages, through its teaching staff on a part time basis, except at the Debre Zeit station.  Breeders in both&#13;
institutions have concentrated on crop varieties which have the greatest potential across as wide a spectrum of&#13;
agro-ecological zones (AEZs) as possible. However, even though research is well organized at these institutes,&#13;
their resources are inadequate compared to the needs of Ethiopia, which has a vast variability of agro-ecological&#13;
conditions. Despite these constraints., some 60 improved varieties, have been released in the last 10 years. Of&#13;
these, 30 varieties of cereals, five varieties of food legumes and six varieties of oilseeds are currently used by ESE.&#13;
A serious lacuna, however, is the absence of research in seed technology for developing seed standards for seed&#13;
quality and seed health care.&#13;
2.8     The breeders seed production program  suffers from a lack of manpower. and from  equipment and&#13;
infrastructural constraints. As a result, it has been difficult to maintain the variety's original characteristics and&#13;
uniformity.   Serious difficulties have also been experienced in roguing some foundation seed fields as&#13;
distinguishing morphological characters for the released varieties included in the program  were not readily&#13;
available from the breeders. Further, once a variety is approved for release, IAR and AUA are often unable to&#13;
produce breeder seed in quantities sufficient for multiplication; for example, only 380 kg of breeder seed was&#13;
produced in 1992 against the total demand of 1. 1 tons. Thus, there hlave been serious gaps in the systematic flow&#13;
of adequate quantities of breeder seed from the research institutions to the producers of basic seeds, because of lack&#13;
of proper seed processing and threshing equipment, and storage facilities.&#13;
2.9     Despite the problems with the currently available quality and quantity of breeder seeds, however, the basic&#13;
research program is making good progress. The program has a number of promising technologies in its pipeline&#13;
with varieties released or under active development for several priority food crops. In basic research efforts,&#13;
Ethiopia has enjoyed the active collaboration of many of the international research centers (CIMMYT, IITA,&#13;
ICRISAT, ICARDA, ILCA, and CIAT) in addition to the IDA-supported Agricultural Research Project (Credit&#13;
1521-ET).&#13;
2.10    The joint venture company, Ethiopia Pioneer Hi-bred Seeds Inc., is currently engaged in an active testing&#13;
program for their imported hybrid maize. Results are promising; already one variety (medium maturity cycle) of&#13;
hybrid maize (PHB 3435) has been submitted for release by the National Variety Release Committee (NVRC).&#13;
Another maize variety (PHB 3253) is expected to be evaluated for release very shortly. The joint venture started&#13;
testing of sunflower and alfalfa seeds and will carrv out a continuous program of adaptive seed research in Ethiopia&#13;
where commercial potential warrants.&#13;
2.11    Variety Release Mechanism: Like many other countries, testing of newly developed varieties, and&#13;
release and registration of these is carried out by NVRC. NVRC was established in 1982 and is composed of&#13;
breeders, agronomists, crop protection experts and social scientists from the various institutions including research&#13;
centers. Since its establishment, NVRC has released more than 29 varieties of cereals, 17 varieties of oilseed&#13;
crops. 7 pulse varieties. 7 cotton varieties, and 7 vegetable tuber varieties. However, NVRC faces a number of&#13;
difficulties including (a) lack of appropriate facilities to test essential characteristics of improved varieties such as&#13;
malting and baking quality, oil content, fiber quality and cooking quality; (b) less than adequate participation of&#13;
institutions represented in the Committee; (c) lack of transport facility; and (d) delay in the release of varieties due&#13;
to late reporting of evaluation results and/or poor attendance by member institutions. However, under the recent&#13;
adopted Seed Policy, NVRC is now answerable to NSIA. Since then, a new organizational set-up and revised&#13;
working guidelines for NVRC and the breeders seeking the service of NVRC have been drafted and approved by&#13;
NSIC in December 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
2.12    Basic Seed Production: The multiplication of breeders seed into basic (or foundation) seed has been the&#13;
weakest link in the chain of seed multiplication in Ethiopia. This has been due both to the lack of breeder seed and&#13;
to a lack of production capacity on the part of ESE itself. The IAR and AUA could only be of limited help in&#13;
producing basic seed on their farms. Until 1989, 80 percent of ESE traded seed has been grown from commercial&#13;
rather than from basic or certified seed. Inevitably, the quality of output achieved was disappointing on two&#13;
counts: (a) genetic quality was below the potential of what research had achieved; and (b) physical quality and&#13;
purity was below the potential attainable through superior husbandry and post-harvest processing.&#13;
2.13    In the late nineteen-eighties, ESE seriously addressed this problem. It obtained land allocation for two&#13;
basic seed farms in Southern Ethiopia, one for highland crops and one for mid-altitude to low-land crops. These&#13;
farms are being developed with the technical and financial assistance of the European Union. The Gonde-Iteya&#13;
500 ha farm near Assela (two non-contiguous blocks of 250 ha each) for highland crops is in operation, though&#13;
some of its basic infrastructure, like the installation of seed processing facilities. is still being completed. Upon full&#13;
completion by 1995, this farm would secure ESE's medium term pre-basic and basic seed requirements for&#13;
highland crops, which constitute 70 percent of ESE's sales. The second 400 ha rainfed basic seed farm at Shalo&#13;
near Awassa, for mid-altitude and low land crops, is expected to be completed by 1997. However. the location of&#13;
both these farms in the South does not achieve satisfactory geographical risk distribution against large-scale crop&#13;
failure or rejection in calamity years. ESE is now considering the feasibility of establishing a third basic seed farm&#13;
in northern Ethiopia.&#13;
2.14    Basic Seed Production by ESE--Pioneer Hibred Joint Venture: Basic seed production by the joint&#13;
venture (Ethiopian Pioneer) started in 1991 with the contracting of 257 ha of land from state farms and ESE basic&#13;
seed farm for hybrid maize and sunflower production. However, seed yields for sunflower were disappointingly&#13;
low. In 1993, about 608 ha was under basic seed production, which resulted in a harvest of about 600 tons of raw&#13;
seed.&#13;
2.15    Commercial Seed Production: ESE's production of commercial seed, about 15,000 tons per annum, has&#13;
taken place mostly on state farms located in Bale, Welega, Gojam, Shoa and Arsi. Private farmers were not&#13;
involved. In most cases, these farms did not adhere to minimum certification standards, and did not follow&#13;
generally accepted seed production practices. The risk of concentrating seed production in a few locations&#13;
increases the attendant risk of crop failures or rejection and has made ESE rethink its policy of exclusive reliance&#13;
on government farms for certified/commercial seed production. In the 1994 crop year ESE has already placed&#13;
contracts with commercial farms for 1,150 hectares out of total seed production contracts for about 7,750 hectares.&#13;
The enterprise needs to widen its production base by contracting with more outgrowers in the vicinity of its seed&#13;
processing facilities. In order to ensure efficient and quality-oriented seed production, ESE could develop "seed&#13;
villages" within the command area of each regional unit; this would overcome the problems caused by the very&#13;
small size of contract grower farms and the problem of isolation. Further, now that two hybrids (BH-140, top-cross&#13;
and BH-660, three-way cross) have been released, and more are in the pipeline, and the Pioneer joint venture also&#13;
has its own hybrids, it is time for ESE to launch a campaign, including demonstrations to popularize hybrids. This&#13;
would help to rapidly increase maize production in the country.&#13;
2.16    Seed Processing and Storage:  Seed Processing and storage is required at each stage of the seed&#13;
production chain. The term "processing" encompasses various post harvest operations including drying, shelling,&#13;
threshing, pre-cleaning, cleaning, grading, treating and packaging. Storage in the present context refers to the&#13;
period between the completion of the processing activities and the distribution for use as breeder/basic/certified&#13;
(commercial) seed. The objective of seed storage is to preserve seed health and viability by paying attention to&#13;
prevailing temperature-cum-humidity regimes, and preventing pest-insect attack. The duration of storage for&#13;
commercial seed would ordinarily not exceed six months, whereas the breeder seed (and possibly some foundation&#13;
seed) may need to be stored for periods of two years or more, and therefore would require specially designed stores&#13;
to provide temperatures (between 15 and 18 degrees celsius) and relative humidity not exceeding 50 percent.&#13;
2.17    The current availability of processing and storage facilities for different stages in the seed production&#13;
chain present several problems. The breeders do not have access to the minimum facilities for the processing and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
storage of their seed. These facilities should include equipment for seed extraction, threshing of small seed lots,&#13;
seed cleaning machines suitable to handle small lots of breeder seed, to avoid the risk of mechanical admixture,&#13;
and small conditioned stores. The two basic seed farms are being equipped by the European Union (EU) with&#13;
adequate processing and storage facilities for raw and processed seed. Commercial seed is processed at ESE's four&#13;
processing plants at Assela, Koffele, Nekempt and Sidamo (Awassa) with a total capacity of 30,000 tons, and three&#13;
mobile processing plants of 10,000 tons capacity each. ESE also has equipment for a processing plant at Bahir Dar&#13;
which has been awaiting installation since 1981. It is expected that this plant would also be commissioned by the&#13;
end of 1995. Thus, ESE would have a total capacity (60,000 to 70,000 tons) which is in excess of its immediate&#13;
needs for processing its own seeds and/or limited custom seed processing; it is recalled, however, that part of the&#13;
excess capacity is inherent to the geographical conditions of the country. However, all of the seed processing plants&#13;
need repairs, rehabilitation and upgrading. The lack of adequate and qualified processing staff at the plants&#13;
constrains efficiency.  Additional Technical Assistance (TA) and training is urgently required to improve&#13;
processing efficiency and cost effectiveness, as well as farmer acceptance of seeds produced by the enterprise. ESE&#13;
benefits from adequate storage facilities at each of its five regional seed production units and some transit stores in&#13;
seed production areas (Kombolcha. Assassa, Dodolla and Robe). None of the regional seed processing units is&#13;
equipped with seed testing facilities.&#13;
2.18    Packaging and Labeling: This is another area of weakness. The seed is packed in standard bag sizes of&#13;
100 and 50 kg, irrespective of the size of farm holdings and the seed rate for different crops. ESE is now revising&#13;
its policy on bag size. Similarly, the non-labeling of seed bags has prevented ESE from developing a brand image,&#13;
and the farmers from getting the minimum needed information concerning the crop variety, physical purity and&#13;
germination percentage.&#13;
2.19    Quality Control, Seed Law and Seed Certification: Seed quality is the single most critical factor which&#13;
determines the health and viability of the seed industry in any country. "Seed" is distinguishable from "grain" only&#13;
on the strength of its physical, physiological and genetical quality, which is traditionally indicated on the seed bag&#13;
through a label. In advanced seed systems, in addition to labeling, seed bags are often certified with certification&#13;
tags by an independent seed certification authority established by law. Once the farmer develops confidence in the&#13;
system and the veracity of the labels, much of the price resistance is generally overcome. In Ethiopia, the practice&#13;
of labeling seed bag has not yet begun; even the highly improved varieties released by the Ethiopian breeders and&#13;
multiplied by ESE are selling without variety labeling. In fact, there is as yet no system of external quality control&#13;
and certification. Very limited quality control is exercised by the Quality Department of ESE which uses only its&#13;
seed testing laboratory located at its headquarters in Addis Ababa. However, under the National Seed Industry&#13;
Policy, a draft seed law has been prepared and is under consideration by the Council of Ministers. Once this law is&#13;
enacted, seed standards, seed rules and administrative procedures would be finalized, and voluntary seed&#13;
certification introduced.&#13;
2.20    Seed Marketing: ESE is virtually the sole institution in the formal sector through which the country's&#13;
seed requirement is currently met; yet the enterprise does not have a proper marketing infrastructure to directly sell&#13;
its seeds to the peasants who produce 90 percent of the country's crop output. ESE markets its seeds to state farms&#13;
directly and, for emergency relief operations, through NGOs and MOA. Seeds to the peasants used to be sold&#13;
through AISCO. Up to 1990, nearly 49 percent of ESE's average annual sales went to the state farms, 27 percent&#13;
to NGOs and 24 percent to AISCO. This arrangement reflected the priority accorded by Government to the state&#13;
sector as opposed to the peasant sector. The seed sales through AISCO have not helped generate a sustained&#13;
demand among peasants partly because of the seed quality problems and partly because of the relatively lower&#13;
priority accorded by AISCO to seed vis-a-vis fertilizer marketing. Seed sales to emergency relief organizations are&#13;
coordinated through a central office of the Christian Relief and Development Association in Addis Ababa.&#13;
Further, of late, the demand from the state farms has declined considerably, but ESE's overall sales have remained&#13;
unaffected because of the very large demand put up by the drought relief program in the last few years. In 1994,&#13;
the share of different agencies changed dramatically: State farms, 5 percent; NGOs, rose to 65 percent; emergency&#13;
relief through MOA went to 29.7 percent, and direct sale to farmers to only 0.3 percent. Since drought and&#13;
emergency relief is not a lasting business, ESE faces the risk of a sudden drop in demand during a year of normal&#13;
weather conditions. Realizing the gravity of the situation, ESE is currently developing a sustainable marketing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
strategy in which peasants would be the main clients. A number of areas in a scheme of seed market development&#13;
would need attention. These include: (a) aggressive sales promotion through a well-trained and well-motivated&#13;
private and cooperative dealer network: (b) full support of the extension agencies in creating seed-qualitv&#13;
consciousness; (c) truthfully labeling of seed bags; (d) adjusting the size of seed bags to the needs of small holders&#13;
(seeds are never sold loose because of quality control problems), and (e) expaniding the range of products offered&#13;
for sale to the farmers.&#13;
2.21    The product mix of ESE sales falls under three major categories: cereals, pulses and oilseeds. The cereal&#13;
group (wheat, teff, malze. barley, sorghum. millet, teff and oats) is b! far the most important and accounts for&#13;
about 82 percent of the cropped area, followed by pulses which occupy 12 percent of the area under cultivation. and&#13;
consist of fava beans, chick peas, field peas, haricot beans, vetch, lcntils and soybeans. The oilseeds group.&#13;
covering about 4.4 percent of 'the area under cultivation consists of noug-mustard, linseed. fenugreek, rape seed.&#13;
sunflower, sesame and groundnut. Among the cereal crops, ESE seed suipply, between 1986 and 1994. comprised&#13;
about 60 percent for wheat, 22 percent for maize, 9 percent for barley and 5 percent and 4 percent for sorghum and&#13;
teff, respectively. There is scope for the formal sector to expand the product mix by including crops like&#13;
vegetables, potatoes and other horticultural crops once an appropriate production and marketing system is in place.&#13;
2.22    Seed Prices Until 1991. ESE was compelled to sell seed at prices whichi were set by the Governmenit&#13;
While the seed sold to the state farms or AISCO was uniformly priced at between 10 and 30 percent below ESE's&#13;
estimated cost of production, seed sold to NGOs was priced at 5 to 10 perceiit above cost. Inevitably, ESE's&#13;
financial viability was seriously undermined. However, since 1991 ESE has raised its prices significantly, and the&#13;
enterprise has made profits since 1992. It should be noted that during the massive drought relief operations of&#13;
1994, seeds were distributed by some of the newly established regional administrations in the drought alfected&#13;
areas below market price and this practice has sent confusing signals to the farming population. The practice of&#13;
making seed available below market price is, other than for emergency relief operations, contrarv to the country's&#13;
national seed policy and needs careful scrutiny. moreover cleaned grains, distributed and sold by emergency relief&#13;
organizations should be labeled accordingly, to make it readily distinguishable from proper seed.&#13;
2.23    In a distorted situation, like the one described above, it is almost impossible to estimate seed demand with&#13;
a reasonable degree of accuracy. However. MOA and the parastatal AISCO, have been estimating demand for&#13;
agricultural inputs through the involvement of grass-roots service cooperatives. This procedure has often resulted&#13;
in a wish list, rather than in effective demand estimation, and the seed requirement estimates usually reached ESE&#13;
(hitherto ESC) well after the seed production decisions had already been taken by the enterprise. However, now&#13;
that ESE is operating in a liberalized environment, with hard budget constraint, it is important that it puts in place&#13;
a mechanism to estimate demand by crop varieties and regions. It is equally important for ESE to rapidly and&#13;
consciously build up an image of seed quality, which entails using attractive bagging materials in an effort to&#13;
improve brand-image, thereby guaranteeing the seed quality through truthful labeling.&#13;
E. Key Institutional Issues&#13;
2.24    Restructuring of Ethiopia Seed Enterprise: The ESE, whose major activities in the area of basic and&#13;
commercial seed production. processing and marketing have already been enumerated in previous sections. is to be&#13;
restructured under the Council of Ministers Regulation No. 154/1993 dated November 19, 1993 ESE has already&#13;
been declared an autonomous commercial enterprise and its Board of Directors has been nominated; two members&#13;
of the Board are elected by the ESE staff as their representatives. The main objective of the restructuring exercise&#13;
is to increase the operational efficiency and cost effectiveness of the enterprise by (a) decentralizing its functions&#13;
into five regional seed processing units, each with appropriate delegation of powers and with full accountability&#13;
and arrangements for timely flow of information and progress reports to the headquarters; (b) setting up a strong&#13;
marketing and promotion department with a view to quickly penetrating the peasant sector; (c) widening ESE&#13;
production base by developing contract seed growing with private commercial seed farms which are now&#13;
increasingly being established, and with individual farmer seed growers; (d) reducing ESE's per unit cost of seed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
production through enhanced efficiencies; and (e) rationalizing the work force at Headquarters as well as the&#13;
regional units and basic seed farms which are operated by the enterprise.&#13;
2.25    In April 1994 the ESE Board of Directors approved some proposals for the restructuring of ESE which&#13;
rationalized the departments within ESE and strengthened the services and infrastructure at basic seed farms and&#13;
regional seed processing units.  While the approved arrangements have already been implemented at the&#13;
headquarters level, a lot of work remains to be done in the regions. This includes re-deployment of staff at various&#13;
levels, designing and implementing new management systems and procedures, working out key monitorable&#13;
performance indicators as well as new accounting systems. In this detailed exercise, ESE is being assisted by&#13;
consultants funded by EU. The consultants are expected to deliver their findings and recommendations by early&#13;
1995. In the meantime, each regional unit has been asked by the senior management to operate as a separate cost&#13;
center, effective July 8, 1994. Much of the future success of ESE would depend upon how well the restructuring&#13;
exercise is implemented.&#13;
2.26    National Seed Industry Agency (NSIA): The focal point for the implementation of the national seed&#13;
industry policy and the overall development of the seed-subsector is the autonomous NSIA which was established&#13;
in July 1993 under Proclamation No. 56/1993 dated July 16, 1993. The Agency has the following objectives: (a)&#13;
to oversee and ensure that the seed industry develops and operates efficiently; (b) to ensure that the seed producers&#13;
and the farming community, as well as the industries using agricultural raw materials and organizations exporting&#13;
agricultural produce benefit from the seed industry; and (c) to create an enabling environment for capacity building&#13;
in research, development and training in the field of genetic resource conservation, crop improvement and seed&#13;
technology. The NSIA has been assigned extensive responsibilities spanning the entire spectrum of seed related&#13;
activities. It would also be the principal coordinating agency for the activities under the Seed Systems&#13;
Development Project. An office for NSIA has already been set up, and a General Manager has been appointed;&#13;
more staff need to be recruited and equipment and vehicles (four wheel drive vehicles) to visit rural areas need to&#13;
be procured. Further, given the vast mandate, NSIA also needs to prepare an annual work program, consistent&#13;
with its abilities and resources, and to prepare an annual report for the information of the Council of Ministers.&#13;
2.27    National Seed Industry Council (NSIC): NSIC is the umbrella body which would guide, monitor and&#13;
oversee the functioning of NSIA and the seed industry. The General Manager, NSIA is the member secretary of&#13;
the NSIC. In terms of the National Seed Industry Policy (NSIP), NSIC would draw membership from&#13;
governmental and non-governmental organizations. However, the proclamation proposed the membership from&#13;
governmental organizations only, and stated that other members could be elected by the council as necessary. It&#13;
would be useful to have private sector representation on the NSIC as early as possible. The Council already has&#13;
had several meetings and has taken some very useful decisions, including the issue of guidelines and procedures&#13;
for variety evaluation and release for governmental and non-governmental organization.&#13;
2.28    Plant Genetic Resource Center (PGRC). Established in 1976, PGRC is a national institution providing&#13;
vital support to the national agricultural research system. The conserved genetic material is accessed by plant&#13;
breeders to develop improved varieties for cultivation. The PGRC collects, conserves. documents and utilizes the&#13;
germplasm resources of edible, economically and medicinally important plants. Ethiopia, with its wide range of&#13;
agro-climatic conditions has been identified as one of the centers of diversity around the world. Primitive cultivars&#13;
of land races and wild relatives of some of the world's major crops are abundant here. The center, however, suffers&#13;
from inadequate facilities like shortage of temperature and humidity-controlled storage rooms, a seed drying unit,&#13;
field and laboratorv equipment, and field vehicles, which need to be provided to sustain the very useful activities of&#13;
the center.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
F. Lessons Learned&#13;
2.29    With regard to the informal seed sector, there are some useful lessons from Secondary Seed Multiplication&#13;
Schemes (SSMS) which have been tried in a number of countries-I-. A major conclusion is that farmer-managed&#13;
seed systems are not a substitute for the conventional seed system based on seed enterprises; both systems are&#13;
complementary, and entrepreneurs from the informal system would gradually evolve into formal enterprises. In&#13;
the most successful informal systems, the emphasis has been on farmers' training and extension advice  In&#13;
Malawi. the Secondary Seed Multiplication Scheme Component did not succeed because farmers could not freely&#13;
sell the seed, but were instead compelled to deliver seed to the Government, whereby seed prices were state&#13;
controlled and subsidized. In Senegal and Gambia, communally managed seed plots were not nearly as well&#13;
maintained as seed plots managed by individual farmers. However, the scheme provided training, helped conduct&#13;
demonstrations in farmers' fields and tried to teach the farmers "how to do better what they have been doing for&#13;
centuries." In Senegal. the informal seed multiplication system worked well, but being heavily donor/NGO&#13;
dependent, sustainability is the issue. In Nepal. the system has been in place for over 10 years; a lesson from this&#13;
experience is that the more a system is decentralized, the more efficiently it works. For instance, working with&#13;
farm families was better than working with groups; storage bins for individual farmers proved more effective than&#13;
mini-seed houses to clean and store up to 40 tons of seeds. Further, small farmers often opted for seed exchange,&#13;
rather than buying seed against cash; subsidies in the formal seed sector discouraged farmers from producing their&#13;
own seed. Another important lesson is that it takes about five years to build sufficient momentum to make the&#13;
program sustainable, provided appropriate backstopping and support from extension continues. A USAID study in&#13;
three villages of Cameroon's Central Province, where farm trials were simultaneously conducted, shows that 90&#13;
percent of the farmers were using improved maize varieties. These lessons have been taken into account when&#13;
designing the SSMS component of the Project.&#13;
2.30    In the case of the formal seed sector, a number of lessons have been learned from past experience. Twelve&#13;
years (1979-91) of Ethiopian experience with full state controls is an example of how a seed system should not be&#13;
run. The system led to (a) under-utilization of seed processing and storage capacities; (b) scant attention to the&#13;
scientific rigors necessary in the system, i.e., missing out on basic seed production, and near total disregard of the&#13;
most critical ingredient in a successful seed system, namely, quality control; (c) absence of supporting institutional&#13;
and legal structures (like the recently set up NSIA, and a seed law) to promote the interest of the subsector; (d)&#13;
neglect of the most important clients (viz., the peasants) who produce 90 percent of the country's crops; (e) a non-&#13;
commercial approach combined with stringent seed and foodgrain price controls; and, as a result, (f) continuing&#13;
losses for ESE, and severely limited benefits to the economy. However, the improvements/reforms, initiated by&#13;
TGE since 1991, are already beginning to show results. ESE has turned the page and has made a profit ever since&#13;
prices of seed and food grains were liberalized. The basic thrust of IDA's experience in other countries (in Sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa alone IDA has some 39 completed or ongoing Projects with a seed component, and three self-&#13;
standing seed projects) points in a similar direction. An internal review by the Bank of the past experience and&#13;
future needs in the seed sector shows a disproportionate placement of seed investments in the public sector; relative&#13;
neglect of the private sector, absence of a conducive policy environment which would encourage private sector&#13;
involvement in the technological functions of the seed sector (including plant breeding, product development,&#13;
import of technology and subsequent dissemination), reliance upon a single institution and ad hoc interventions by&#13;
the Government, have generally met with poor success. On the other hand, areas of relative success have included&#13;
investments in institutional development, technical assistance and training. These lessons have been built into the&#13;
design of the project by directing a major part of the credit for the development of the formal sector as well as the&#13;
informal sector.&#13;
1' These experiences have been documented in Bal and Douglas' "Designing Successful Farmer-Managed Seed&#13;
Systems (Winroch 1992)" and AFTD's "Seed Systems in Sub-Saharan Africa-Issues and Options".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
G. Design Considerations for the Seed Project&#13;
2.31    The following considerations influenced the design of the project. Firt. the proposed seed system should&#13;
be specific to Ethiopia; it must be consistent with the evolutionary stage of its economic policies and fit with the&#13;
level of agricultural and infrastructural development, as well as with the maturity of its institutions. Second, while&#13;
the serious food security concerns of Ethiopia would require a rapid adoption of improved seed, the experience of&#13;
several countries shows that the formal seed sector has seldom been effective in quickly reaching out to the&#13;
difficult, inaccessible, small holder pockets, in which the country abounds. On the other hand, some experience,&#13;
even if limited, is now available to guide simultaneous interventions in the informal sector, as an effective means to&#13;
alleviate household food security and poverty concerns. Since seed cleaning and preservation is an activity which&#13;
essentially belongs to women, their involvement in training for knowledge and skills upgrading would be crucial.&#13;
Thus, the project recommends a mix of formal and informal seed sector development strategies. Thijrd given the&#13;
nature of the seed industry, where biological processes strongly influence the pace of growth, and given the&#13;
evolutionary nature of institutions (one-year old NSIA, for example) and the current status of the private sector&#13;
which has been emasculated during two decades of the previous regime, the seed industry development would&#13;
require a phased program of implementation over a period of 15 to 20 years. The proposed project has thus been&#13;
designed as the first phase of this longer-term program to establish the basis for and direction of change.&#13;
Restructuring ESE on the lines proposed under the project would assist ESE to change from a supply-oriented&#13;
parastatal to a market-oriented commercial enterprise. Fourth, the project proposes to use the restructured ESE&#13;
itself as an agent of change by encouraging ESE to progressively contract its seed production programs with&#13;
commercial farmers as well as peasants, and market its seeds through a network of individual private and&#13;
cooperative retailers. ESE would also provide service to private seed producers by custom processing their seeds at&#13;
their regional processing plants. Such systematic grass root initiatives are critical to the building of capacity in the&#13;
private seed sector, which is virtually non-existent at present. Further, while the main responsibility for an on-&#13;
farm seed production system in the informal sector must rest with regional extension agencies, ESE would have an&#13;
important role in the timely supply of right-size seed packages of the right varieties at the right places, and in&#13;
assisting extension agencies to formulate and deliver messages to participant farmers on relevant seed&#13;
technologies. Fifth. and finally, various project components are designed to contribute to poverty alleviation in&#13;
Ethiopia. The entire secondary seed multiplication program in the informal sector, would make deep cuts into the&#13;
transportation and marketing costs, and make seeds available to poor farmers in remote locations, the enrollment&#13;
of smallholders as ESE's contract seed producers, the appointment of small businessmen as seed retailers, the&#13;
concept of private seed producers and sellers, usually described as seedsmen (para 3.17), who are expected to have&#13;
low transaction costs and therefore lower prices--all these are designed to improve small holders access to&#13;
improved seeds and thus contribute to an increase in their incomes. In addition, the project's support to the Plant&#13;
Genetic Resource Center (PGRC) would ensure that promotion of a few high yielding varieties would not eliminate&#13;
the tremendous genetic diversity represented by land races and primitive cultivars of crops grown by small farmers.&#13;
This indigenous and locally adapted germplasm is important as a source of genetically based drought tolerance,&#13;
pest and disease resistance and other traits which would remain critical, particularly for small farmers with poor&#13;
land and little capacity to purchase the inputs.&#13;
H. Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
2.32    The rationale for IDA involvement stems from the following considerations. First, building capacity to&#13;
produce high quality seeds is the basic first step in any agricultural modernization program--it is the foundation&#13;
over which the superstructure of other yield enhancing programs rests. Second, it fits in well with IDA's approach&#13;
to strengthen agricultural support services, which essentially comprise strong research and extension programs&#13;
backed by a sound seed and fertilizer supply system. IDA has already assisted TGE with an agricultural research&#13;
project, and is now assisting with the proposed National Fertilizer Sector Project, while another agricultural&#13;
research-cum-extension project is in the pipeline. A Seed Systems Development Project (SSDP) would be a natural&#13;
complement to the on-going IDA support of the agricultural sector; it would, in fact, help ensure that the Ethiopian&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
rainfed agricultural system develops resilience and capacity to cope with erratic rainfall patterns and drought by&#13;
widening farmers varietal options in terms of planting time, maturity period, and capacity to cope with moisture&#13;
stress. Third, given the small average size of holdings in Ethiopia, and the fact that some 60 percent of the farmers&#13;
are below the poverty line, the project would contribute to sustained enhanced yields and higher incomes, and thus&#13;
help alleviate rural poverty. Fourth, and finally, the Government has demonstrated ownership and commitment to&#13;
the project by the recently announced seed policy and strategy document which supports. inter alia, the&#13;
participation of both the public and the private seed enterprises in the development of the seed sector and its&#13;
willingness to allocate a portion of the proposed credit to the development of the private sector. Moreover, ESE,&#13;
which is the only seed enterprise at present, has been made an autonomous commercial enterprise, subject to hard&#13;
budget constraint, with its own board of directors. Major restructuring of ESE is underway.&#13;
2.33    The project fits in well with the IDA's Country Assistance Strategy to support Ethiopia's rapid social and&#13;
economic recovery and the attainment of a high and sustainable rate of economic growth in the short to medium&#13;
term. The central objective of the Bank's program of assistance for Ethiopia remains the reduction of poverty&#13;
through a combination of sustainable economic growth and employment generation, improvements in basic social&#13;
services, and special targeted measures to improve income, self reliance, and quality of life for the poorest groups&#13;
and communities. Economic growth is the essential basis of a long-term strategy to reduce poverty through&#13;
increased employment and food production. The aim of the Bank's program is to support this growth strategy&#13;
through a series of important measures: a policy framework to stimulate production, exports, and private sector&#13;
growth; a reliable flow of inputs for the productive sectors; essential improvement and expansion of infrastructure;&#13;
environmental rehabilitation and conservation; and institutional capacity essential for economic growth. The&#13;
proposed Project would ensure the supply of seed, a vital input to raise agricultural production and productivity,&#13;
and it would thereby support TGE's strategic goal to maintain the national food deficit within a level that can be&#13;
met from regular imports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objective and Components&#13;
3.1    The objective of the Project is to contribute to the national goal of increased agricultural production and&#13;
productivity by laying the foundation for the development of a broad-based and competitive seed industry which&#13;
draws its strength both from the formal and the informal seed systems.&#13;
3.2    The Project supports Seed Policy Reform, through each of its two components. The components are: (a)&#13;
Seed Enterprise Development; and (b) Capacity Building. The first component supports (i) the development of the&#13;
informal seed sector; (ii) encourages private sector entrv into formal seed business; and supports (iii) the&#13;
restructuring of the Ethiopian Seed Enterprise from a centrally managed parastatal to a decentralized and&#13;
commercially oriented enterprise. The second component involves: (i) institutional strengthening: and (ii) human&#13;
resource development, both in the formal and the informal sector&#13;
B. Seed Policy Reform&#13;
3.3     Satisfactory implementation of the project would require a conducive policy environment. The project&#13;
would build on the impressive initiatives already taken by TGE (para 2.6) and would require rapid implementation&#13;
progress in four specific areas namely, seed pricing, seed marketing, private sector development, and quality&#13;
control and seed certification.&#13;
3.4     Seed Pricing: There is a strong need to harmonize the institutional, regional and national seed pricing&#13;
policies to prepare the basis for developing a competitive seed industry (para 2.22). The current practice of some&#13;
regions subsidizing seed at the local level, for reasons other than to cope with the negative effects of severe&#13;
drought, hinders the growth of a healthy and competitive seed industry. Moreover, subsidization of seed is contrary&#13;
to the National Seed Industry Policy (NSIP) according to which, under normal circumstances, "Seed price would be&#13;
determined by market forces"; it is important to ensure the implementation of this policy by all seed producing and&#13;
distributing agencies, as well as the national and regional administrations. Assurances were obtained during&#13;
negotiations that, starting with the 1995 crop season, seed prices would be market determined. However, for&#13;
emergency situations following severe drought or  other natural calamities, a targeted and relief oriented&#13;
assistance, aimed to safeguard continuity of agricultural production in the affected areas, would be provided&#13;
without affecting the normal seed marketing operations in other, non-affected areas.&#13;
3 5     Seed Marketing: Seed marketing is historically the wveakest link in the seed production/marketing chain&#13;
in Ethiopia In the past. ESE engaged mainlv in institutional sales; direct sales to the peasant sector were, as&#13;
recent as 1993-94, less than I percent (para 2.20). Development of an efficient and well-articulated seed&#13;
marketing system, capable of reaching out to the peasants, is a critical building block for an effective seed system&#13;
IDA has been informed that ESE would soon have its new marketing strategy to cover the following aspects: (a)&#13;
direct retailing of seeds from all ESE processing plants; (b) establishing a private and cooperative dealer network&#13;
that is well trained and motivated, and spread out in all agricultural areas; (c) adjusting the size of seed bags to the&#13;
needs of small farmers; (d) supplying, according to agro-ecological needs, the most suitable varieties of seeds; (e)&#13;
truthful labeling of all seed bags; (f) market-determined prices for each location; and (g) aggressive sales&#13;
promotion. Towards this end, the project would support the periodic training of seed dealers by NSIA under the&#13;
Capacity Building component: and enforcement mechanisms for the seed law which is currently under&#13;
consideration by the Council of Ministers. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that NSIA would assist&#13;
ESE in implementing its new marketing strategy and would provide training to the emerging private seed&#13;
marketers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
3.6    Private Sector:  While the private sector has played a very important role in the growth of the seed&#13;
industry in many developing countries, in Ethiopia the private sector is conspicuous by its absence. Only recently,&#13;
limited seed production has been contracted between ESE and some newly established commercial farms. To&#13;
begin with, the private sector can play a very useful role in strengthening the seed system through contract seed&#13;
production and seed marketing. Private sector participation in these areas could immediately widen the seed&#13;
production base and improve small farmers access to quality seed. Assurances were obtained during negotiations&#13;
that NSIA would encourage the private sector to (a) produce and distribute improved seed; (b) engage in plant&#13;
breeding; and (c) start seed enterprises. Further, the Government would license private foreign seed firms, which&#13;
show interest, to undertake crop research activities on non-restricted crops, in line with the national seed and&#13;
agricultural research policies.&#13;
3.7    Quality Control and Seed Certification: Given that seed quality is the single most critical factor which&#13;
determines the viability of any seed enterprise, and given that the quality aspect has not attracted adequate&#13;
attention so far, the project would support the needed preparatory actions for introducing quality control measures&#13;
like the enactment of a seed law. formulation of seed rules and administrative procedures, setting of seed standards,&#13;
building of a central seed testing laboratory and appointment of seed certification staff. However, at the beginning,&#13;
emphasis would be limited to quality control and truthful labeling of seeds before marketing, rather than&#13;
compulsory seed certification. A full-fledged national quality control and seed certification system would be&#13;
established at a later stage in the evolution of the seed program. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that&#13;
NSIAINSIC would attach priority to the creation of a legal framework and ensure that, to begin with all seed&#13;
marketed by Government agencies, as well as ESE, would be truthfully labeled, and that seed certification would be&#13;
on a voluntary basis.&#13;
C. Detailed Project Components&#13;
Component I - Seed Enterprise Development (USS17.2 million)&#13;
3.8    Informal Sector--Secondary Seed Multiplication Scheme (USS5.0 million): It is recognized that it&#13;
takes a long time for formal seed systems to gain popular usage in remote, difficult to access rural areas, which&#13;
therefore remain deprived of improved genetic material for enhancing crop yields. Farmers have demonstrated for&#13;
centuries that they know how to sustain agricultural production, even if at relatively low yield levels, through&#13;
adaptation and improvement of land races by informal (farmer-to-farmer) seed exchange systems. The project&#13;
would build on this strength by training farmers at selected locations in improved seed production, cleaning and&#13;
preservation technology and assisting them with planting materials in the form of improved seeds, which would&#13;
then gradually become a part of the informal seed exchange system. This would help raise the yield levels of their&#13;
crops and contribute to the preservation of the existing genetic pool. However, since this would be an altogether&#13;
new experience for Ethiopia, and management structures to handle interventions in the form of machines, civil&#13;
works and the like do not exist at the village level, the project would, in addition to training, provide the farmer&#13;
families simple tools, like hand sieves for seed cleaning and family size seed storage bins, to make the program&#13;
sustainable with minimum govemment intervention. The project would also strengthen the national seed extension&#13;
system through training of extension/agents and subject matter specialists. It would improve the mobility of the&#13;
extension staff through procurement of bicycles and mules, and would finance incremental operating expenses of&#13;
the implementing agencies as well as the seed mini-kits which would be distributed free of charge. This project&#13;
component would progressively build on the experience gained each year, and would draw upon the resources of&#13;
individuals and consulting firms or business groups for training, designing management systems, improving&#13;
communication skills, community participation, evaluation and technical advice.&#13;
3.9    The Secondary Seed Multiplication Scheme (SSMS) would be implemented by the regional agricultural&#13;
bureaus under the guidance of MOA, while the overall responsibility for the design and coordination of the SSMS&#13;
would rest with NSIA. The regional agriculture bureaus would use ESE for the supply of quality seeds, and the&#13;
agricultural research system for technical backstopping. NSIA would develop the first year's program in elaborate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
consultation with the regional agricultural bureaus, MOA, the PGRC, and the agricultural research system.&#13;
Implementation arrangements are detailed in Chapter V. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the&#13;
SSMS work plan for Project Year I would be discussed and finalized in the Project Launch Workshop; subsequent&#13;
annual SSMS work plans would be submitted by NSIA two months prior to the start of the new project year for&#13;
review and comments by IDA.&#13;
3.10    Formal Sector--Ethiopian Seed Enterprise (USS11.2 million): ESE is now a public autonomous&#13;
enterprise (para 2.24), operating on commercial principles, and thereby facing hard budget constraints. ESE's&#13;
restructuring is expected to be completed soon (para 2.25).  Managers and heads of departments at ESE&#13;
headquarters have already been appointed, as have the heads of the basic seed farms and the five regional seed&#13;
processing units. However, the detailed staffing plan for each of the regional units is still being worked out. In the&#13;
new reality, each of the five regional units would develop its own seed production (through contract seed growers.&#13;
including commercial farms) and seed marketing capability (through a network of private retailers) and it is,&#13;
therefore, clear that an adequate Management Information System (MIS), allowing management at a central level&#13;
to stay current with the operational and financial status of various regional units, is of utmost importance. The&#13;
ESE is assisted by EU funded consultants in the task of setting up the MIS. Assurances were obtained during&#13;
negotiations that ESE's submission of the final and detailed restructuring proposal and the business plan (inclusive&#13;
of the Key Monitoring Indicators) for the first year would be a condition of Credit Effectiveness. Business plans for&#13;
subsequent years would be submitted by ESE, through NSIA, to IDA at least two months prior to the new (annual)&#13;
planning period.&#13;
3.11    Basic Seed Production: Given the agro-ecological diversity in Ethiopia and the location of the two&#13;
existing basic seed farms in the southern part of Ethiopia, (para 2.13) there is a case for locating at least one&#13;
additional basic seed farm in the northern parts of the country, to produce seeds of region-specific crops, as well as&#13;
crop varieties that are adapted to specific locations in the north.  Another advantage of such a dispersed&#13;
arrangement would be a reduction in the risk of seed crop failure from disease or other natural hazards. ESE has&#13;
proposed one new basic seed farm to cater specifically to the needs of seed producers in Gojam, Gonder, Tigray&#13;
and Wollo regions. The project provides funding for a detailed feasibility study of such farm; the project would&#13;
eventually support investment, if the study concludes positive on the financial and economic viability. Assurances&#13;
were obtained during negotiations for ESE to submit the terms of reference for the feasibility study of the third&#13;
basic seed farm, through NSIA, not later than at the start of the second project year.&#13;
3.12    Seed Processing:  The project would provide funds for the rehabilitation of ESE's seed processing&#13;
infrastructure. Requirements for spare-parts, replacement of worn out accessories, screens, etc., have already been&#13;
worked out in detail by ESE. The project would further support the installation at Bahir Dar of seed processing&#13;
equipment (procured in 1981 but never installed), and the procurement of some of its essential (and hitherto&#13;
missing) parts. The project would further provide for one mobile seed cleaner (to be operated in combination with&#13;
the two existing mobile cleaners at Bahir Dar) to ensure seed cleaning in areas like Mekele, Kambolcha and Sodo.&#13;
Local production of seed for the Tigray, Wollo and Sodo areas would considerably reduce the (prohibitive)&#13;
transportation costs and the problems of seed adaptation to local agro-ecological situations. The project provides&#13;
for funding of feasibility studies to erect permanent seed processing units in these areas, after the initial seed&#13;
production and marketing efforts are successful.&#13;
3.13    The iack of a qualified and experienced seed processing engineer with ESE, to coordinate and supervise&#13;
processing, and ensure preventive maintenance, is an important constraint which is further aggravated by the&#13;
shortage of trained manpower at various processing locations. The constraints would be overcome through&#13;
appropriate training of ESE staff by NSIA. Training would, in addition to seed processing, include seed packaging&#13;
and seed labeling. NSIA would formulate and implement training programs for the staff of private and public&#13;
sector organizations to cover the seed processing plant's operation, management and maintenance.&#13;
3.14    Seed Quality Control: Seed quality control has to be given the highest attention in any seed system. The&#13;
project would finance the upgrading of ESE's headquarters Seed Testing Laboratory (STL) in Addis Ababa, and&#13;
the setting up of mini-STLs at each of the five regional units, which would, in accordance with their new mandate,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
be responsible for the production and marketing of most of the seeds within their respective jurisdictions. ESE's&#13;
headquarters and regional laboratories are crucial for building a sound internal quality control system. in which a&#13;
small percentage of samples tested in the mini-STLs would be routinely re-tested at the headquarters to ensure&#13;
consistency in test results. The headquarters laboratory would be responsible for supervision and technical&#13;
backstopping of regional mini-STLs; the laboratories would be an effective tool in enforcing seed quality standards&#13;
and reducing cases of malpractice.&#13;
3.15    Strategic Move Towards Commercialization: Finally, it has been agreed that ESE's strategic move&#13;
towards commercialization would include the following: (a) speedy implementation of the ESE restructuring plan.&#13;
(b) introduction of appropriate cost control measures and a proper management information system; (c) upgrading&#13;
the operational and management capacity of the regional units' staff through systematic training; (d) diversification&#13;
of the seed program to include hybrid and vegetable seed production and marketing as per the National Seed&#13;
Industry Policy (NSIP); (e) minimization of the transportation costs through a revised strategy involving seed&#13;
production and marketing in close proximity to the processing plant, by means of a compact area or a "seed&#13;
village" approach; (f) brand image building for product quality; and (g) custom processing as well as testing of&#13;
seeds for the private seed growers, as well as state farms, based on the availability of excess capacity and charging&#13;
of a fee. While many of these steps would take time to bear fruit, an explicit move in this direction is imperative.&#13;
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that NSIA/ESE would annually review progress of implementation&#13;
of the aforementioned strategy. and submit this report to IDA.&#13;
3.16    Formal Sector--Encouraging Private Sector Entry in the Seed Business (US$1.0 million): To broaden&#13;
participation in the production. processing and marketing of seeds, NSIA would provide support to the&#13;
development of private seed enterprises discussed in paras 3.17 and 3.18 and Annex 1. The privately owned seed&#13;
enterprise is a new concept in the country, and therefore, role models do not exist. The private sector would need&#13;
assistance in preparing feasibility studies and business plans for bankable projects; the Business Development&#13;
Specialist in NSIA would provide technical guidance to individuals and entrepreneurs entering the seed production&#13;
and/or marketing business. This assistance would be in the forn of consultancy services for techno-economic&#13;
feasibility studies to support private sector initiatives in seed production and marketing. The assistance would&#13;
include, but not necessarily be limited to (a) mobilization of the private sector through workshops, seminars and&#13;
awareness campaigns; (b) assistance to potential entrepreneurs in the formulation and the screening of business&#13;
development proposals, in a format suitable for commercial bank financing; (c) advice on appropriate technology&#13;
(including equipment); and (d) identification of domestic and international financial institutions willing to support&#13;
private sector initiatives in the seed sector. It is worth noting that the private sector will be increasingly involved in&#13;
contract seed growing for ESE, as well as in the retailing of ESE seeds. Under the project, the NSIA would&#13;
periodically train private seed dealers in seed handling, transportation, storage and marketing.&#13;
3.17    Seedsmen: In addition to the informal farmer-to-farmer seed production system (paras 3.8 and 3.9), the&#13;
project would provide support to private producer-sellers ("seedsmen"). These could, for instance, be progressive&#13;
farmers in a particular locality who build on the farmer-to-farmer seed exchange and cater to localized demand, at&#13;
minimal distribution and transport costs. Also, as contract seed growers gain experience in seed production, thev&#13;
would provide a consistent, stable source of good quality seed within close proximity of the processing facilities.&#13;
Some of the seed growers would, eventually. either individually or in groups, undertake seed production and&#13;
distribution on their own. As this process evolves, such independent seed growers would procure basic seeds from&#13;
ESE and breeder seeds from the research stations. Furthermore, local entrepreneurs dealing in agricultural inputs&#13;
may decide to enter the seed business as seed marketers. This would open new outlets and encourage greater&#13;
private sector involvement at the wholesale and retail levels. NSIA would support all such initiatives through a&#13;
convenient access to technical know-how, and basic, as well as certified seeds of improved varieties.&#13;
3 18    Other Seed Enterprises: In view of the varied agro-ecological conditions in Ethiopia, opportunities exist&#13;
for profitable production of hybrids, improved open pollinated varieties (e.g.. maize), and seeds of specialty, high&#13;
value crops (e.g., horticulture). The project would provide advisory services to small and medium-scale enterprises&#13;
that propose to engage in these categories of seed. It is difficult to estimate at present how many private seed&#13;
enterprises would evolve during the project period. However, in view of the interest expressed during project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
appraisal and reappraisal by the private sector in seed multiplication, processing and distribution, it is expected&#13;
that ten to twenty, small to medium scale, seed enterprises would be assisted under the project. The viability of&#13;
these enterprises would be determined through feasibility studies, under the guidance of NSIA. The intended&#13;
beneficiaries under this subcomponent would include partnerships or joint ventures involving both the private and&#13;
the public enterprises which may produce seed for the domestic market or for export. NSIA would provide the&#13;
enterprises with support during the planning and implementation phase and assist them to secure financing as&#13;
appropriate from local commercial banks and/or from development banks. Assurances were obtained during&#13;
negotiations that (a) NSIA would develop a set of selection criteria for identification of enterprises eligible for&#13;
technical assistance and training under the project; and (b) that private sector participants would have equal access&#13;
to breeder seed of publicly-bred varieties, to basic seed from ESE, and that they would be free to import seed for&#13;
use in the development of new varieties or seed production, as it is consistent with NSIP.&#13;
Component II--Capacity Building (US$13.8 million)&#13;
3.19    Institutional Strengthening (US$12.0 million): The project would support the strengthening of the&#13;
existing regulatory and service institutions in the seed sector and focus thereby on the following institutions:&#13;
(a)    National Seed Industry Agency (NSIA): The NSIA, established in July 1993, has the primary&#13;
responsibility for seed policies and their effective implementation. The project would support the&#13;
strengthening of NSIA, which is a nascent institution, by providing equipment and furniture,&#13;
vehicles and technical assistance. This is expected to enable NSIA to provide a range of services&#13;
to all levels of seed industry including: (i) identification of equipment and seed processing&#13;
facilities required by the village-level schemes, the seedsmen and other enterprises; (ii) assistance&#13;
to seed enterprises to develop bankable business plans; (iii) launching quality seed awareness&#13;
programs; (iv) providing linkage among the various segments of the seed sector; (v) developing&#13;
promotional materials that would be used by the agricultural extension as well as the seed&#13;
producing and marketing enterprises; (vi) identifying appropriate training opportunities and&#13;
organizing training courses for personnel from all segments of the seed sector; and (vii)&#13;
performing an important liaison function between fledgling seed entrepreneurs and the banking&#13;
sector with the capacity to provide technical assistance to both parties. A very important&#13;
responsibility of NSIA would be to pilot the entire Secondary Seed Multiplication Scheme in&#13;
close collaboration with regional agricultural bureaus, PGRC, the research institutions, ESE and&#13;
MOA. NSIA would be staffed with experts in Business Development, Seed Quality Control &amp;&#13;
Certification, Seed Technology, Seed Processing, Industry-wide Promotion and Human Resource&#13;
Development. An agreed organizational structure for NSIA with key positions is attached as&#13;
Annex 7. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that recruitment of key NSIA staff&#13;
would be completed, and that the terms of reference and remuneration of all Project Coordination&#13;
and Monitoring Unit (PCMU) staff would be satisfactory to IDA; this would be a condition for&#13;
credit effectiveness.&#13;
(b)    National Variety Release Committee (NVRC):  The Government has recognized that an&#13;
efficient mechanism for variety evaluation, release and registration is fundamental to the success&#13;
of the seed systems in Ethiopia. NVRC's criteria for release of a variety has been revised to&#13;
include the evaluation and registration of privately developed varieties. The revised guidelines.&#13;
which include defined objectives and responsibilities of the NVRC, were approved by the&#13;
National Seed Industry Council (NSIC) in December 1993. The project would provide funds to&#13;
cover incremental recurrent costs, as well as the costs of workshops, seminars, publications and&#13;
one full-time staff in NSIA to handle the day to day activities of NVRC. The NVRC would&#13;
publish yearly a seed /variety register. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the first&#13;
annual seed/variety register, listing both the varieties in production and those withdrawn from&#13;
production, would be published before the end of the first project year, and that the register would&#13;
be up-dated in each of the subsequent project years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
(c)    Plant Quarantine Service (PQS): A new quarantine legislation and regulation has been put&#13;
into effect by TGE in October, 1992 with a view to minimizing the risk of entry of serious pests&#13;
and plant diseases into Ethiopia. The recent reorganization of PQS necessitates the streamlining&#13;
of working procedures between the headquarters and field stations. The project would provide&#13;
vehicles and cover the incremental recurrent costs associated with their operation and&#13;
maintenance. During project implementation an assessment would be made regarding the&#13;
prospects for further investment in the plant quarantine service. The adequacy of the plant&#13;
quarantine arrangements, as implemented under the new regulations would be subject to mid-&#13;
term review. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that PQS would establish and&#13;
implement uniform and effective inspection and detection procedures before June 30, 1996.&#13;
(d)    Plant Genetics Resource Center (PGRC): Support to the PGRC under the project would&#13;
involve the construction of storage and drying rooms at PGRC headquarters, and the supply of&#13;
machinery and equipment and vehicles, in addition to the associated incremental recurrent costs.&#13;
(e)    Research and Development Institutes: At present, the Alemaya University of Agriculture&#13;
(AUA) and the Institute of Agricultural Research (IAR) are the only two plant breeding&#13;
institutions in the country. Assured supply of breeder seed of satisfactory quality and in adequate&#13;
quantity is of crucial importance for the development of a healthy and dynamic seed sector. The&#13;
project would provide for the upgrading of AUA's breeder seed stations at Alemaya and Debre&#13;
Zeit. Upgrading would include civil works, laboratory and other equipment, computers, cooling&#13;
equipment for a cold storage room, generator sets, and a very limited number of vehicles and&#13;
furniture. In addition, the project would provide technical assistance in the form of short faculty&#13;
visits for seed technology, incremental operation and maintenance costs, salaries and wages and&#13;
other recurrent costs for office and laboratory supplies. Similarly, the project would upgrade&#13;
each one of the seven breeder seeds units of IAR located at Holetta, Melkassa, Bako, Awassa,&#13;
Kulumsa, Adet and Melka Werer. This would include seed stores, conditioned storage rooms,&#13;
seed drying floors, the supply of agricultural machinery, equipment and furniture, and a few&#13;
vehicles, as well as funding for incremental operation and maintenance costs, associated with the&#13;
proposed investments, and salaries of technicians recruited for breeder seed production.&#13;
(f)    Quality Control and Seed Certification: The project would fund the establishment of a full-&#13;
fledged national quality control and seed certification system, including an independent National&#13;
Seed Testing Laboratory under NSIA.&#13;
(g)    National Seed Reserve:  Many parts of Ethiopia are chronically drought-prone, and this&#13;
continually endangers food security and aggravates poverty for a vast section of the population.&#13;
In the first Project year, NSIA would work out the details of the National Seed Reserve Stock&#13;
Scheme and would be assisted in this particular task by a consultant who would work in close&#13;
collaboration with PGRC, IAR, AUA, ESE, the Food Security Reserve Administration (FSRA)&#13;
and the regional agricultural bureaus. The terms of reference for the national seed reserve stock&#13;
study are shown in the Annex 2. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that (i) NSIA&#13;
would get the seed reserve study completed, with terms of reference satisfactory to IDA, before&#13;
the end of the first project year; and (ii) the report would be reviewed jointly by IDA and the&#13;
Government.&#13;
(h)    Ethiopian Seed Enterprise (ESE): The details of the proposed institutional strengthening of&#13;
ESE are discussed in paras 3.10-3.15.&#13;
3.20    Human Resource Development (US$1.8 million):  Human resource development would comprise&#13;
technical assistance and training. Development of human resources is critical to the success and sustainability of&#13;
the project. The project would essentially be managed by Ethiopians with very limited expatriate technical&#13;
assistance, local technical assistance and training, and some overseas training in the form of fellowships.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that NSIA would be the focal point for organizing and coordinating&#13;
all technical assistance and training programs as well as foreign fellowships, funded under the project. A brief&#13;
description of the activities to be carried out in the context of the development of human resources is given below:&#13;
(a)    Technical Assistance: Short-term technical assistance would be arranged to assist local staff in&#13;
(i) the preparation of specifications of equipment and machinery needed to rehabilitate seed&#13;
processing facilities, formulation and implementation of training programs, and organizing&#13;
workshops to train staff in the repair, operation and maintenance of seed processing and storage&#13;
facilities; (ii) advising private seed enterprises in the selection of appropriate seed processing&#13;
equipment; (iii) defining a marketing strategy and preparing a comprehensive action plan which&#13;
would, inter alia, include market promotion, staff and dealer training, and possibly&#13;
demonstrations and farmers field days; (iv) developing management information systems for the&#13;
seed sector; and (v) training staff for managing seed processing, packaging and storage&#13;
operations. The project would also arrange for the technical assistance required to help NSIA&#13;
develop some streamlined procedures and systems so that it could quickly familiarize itself with&#13;
IDA supervision, procurement and disbursement procedures as well as its reporting requirements.&#13;
Annex 8 contains details on Technical Assistance.&#13;
(b)    Training: The Project would provide for local training and workshops, details of which are&#13;
shown in Annex 8 and Annex 9, Attachment 3. Much of the training would be on-the-job&#13;
training. However, some formal training would be necessary to suit specific requirements. NSIA&#13;
would play an important role in organizing training in the areas of seed production, processing,&#13;
packaging and storage, inventory control, and repair and maintenance of seed processing&#13;
equipment. To improve sustainability, AUA's undergraduate programs in crop science and seed&#13;
technology would be strengthened. Under the project, provisions would be made to increase the&#13;
elective courses for graduate programs. Similarly, provisions would be made to enhance the&#13;
skills of teaching and research staff at AUA.&#13;
(c)    Foreign Fellowships:   Availability of qualified seed technologists in research stations,&#13;
agricultural universities, ESE and other seed enterprises would accelerate the development of the&#13;
seed industry. Given that AUA does not have qualified and experienced faculty to handle all the&#13;
subdisciplines of seed technology, forward planning is important for the country. The project&#13;
would sponsor one Ph.D and five M.Sc's (four of which would be fully funded by TGE) in seed&#13;
technology.&#13;
&#13;

IV. THE PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
A. Project Costs&#13;
4.1       The base costs of the project are US$27.0 million, which includes US$0.8 million of Project Preparation&#13;
Facility (PPF) finds; physical contingencies would amount to US$2.6 million and price contingencies to US$2.2&#13;
million. Total project costs would therefore be US$31.8 million, inclusive of the Birr equivalent of US$2.7 million&#13;
in taxes and duties. Foreign exchange requirements of the Project would total US$13.1 million, equivalent to 41&#13;
percent of total project costs. The project costs are summarized by components in Table 4.1 below:&#13;

B. Project Financing&#13;
4.2     The Project would be financed from three distinct sources. These sources are (a) IDA, to provide US$22.0&#13;
million; (b) TGE, to provide the Birr equivalent of US$4.1 million; and (c) ESE, to provide the Birr equivalent of&#13;
US$5.7 million. IDA and TGE would enter into a Development Credit Agreement; TGE would on-lend US$5.6&#13;
million of IDA funds to ESE, as per Subsidiary Credit Agreement. IDA funds which are on-lent by TGE to ESE&#13;
correspond to the full foreign exchange requirements of ESE's investment. ESE's total funding requirements under&#13;
the project are equivalent to US$1 1.3 million, of which US$7.8 million is for investment and the Birr equivalent of&#13;
US$ 3.5 million in recurrent costs (both investment and recurrent costs, including taxes and duties).&#13;
4.3     IDA would contribute 69 percent of total project costs. IDA funds would be used to cover 10() percent of&#13;
foreign expenditure by government institutions for equipment (including laboratory benching, but excluding office&#13;
fiurniture), and vehicles: 100 percent of technical assistance, training (including fellowships) and studies, and 100&#13;
percent of the estimated foreign exchange content of government expenditure for civil works, equivalent to 60&#13;
percent of total costs. IDA would further fiancc up to US$2.9 million towards the establishment of a National&#13;
Strategic Seed Reserve. Incremental recurrent costs of the Govcrnment would be financed bv IDA on a declining&#13;
scale, starting with 100 percent in the first and the second project years, and 50 percent in the project years&#13;
thereafter. IDA would not finanice any of the taxes and/or duties.&#13;

Note a"/  the USS 11.3 million proposed investmiient ofthe Ethiopian Seed Enterprise (ESE) would be financed for&#13;
US$5.6million provided by IDA to TGE. and on-lent by TGE to ESE, and US$ 5.7 million provided&#13;
from ESE's own resources in Birr equivalent&#13;
4.4     Funds of the Association would be used to cover 10()  percent of the foreign exchange required for&#13;
investment by ESE: in the case of civil works, this corresponds to an estimated average of 50 percent of total costs&#13;
of civil works (in which zero percent is financed for land acquisition). IDA funds would further be used to cover&#13;
100 percent of the foreign, and 85 percent of local expenditures for equipment, furniture (including laboratory&#13;
benching, but excluding office furniture) and vehicles. IDA would also finance 100 percent of the technical&#13;
assistance, training (including fellowships) and studies. None of the IDA funds would be used for incremental&#13;
recurrent cost financing of seed enterprises, be it public (ESE) or private nor taxes.&#13;
4.5     TGE would contribute 13 percent of total project costs to cover all taxes and duties related to government&#13;
expenditure, the estimated local currencv content of the works envisaged for government entities, as well as the&#13;
balance of the Government's recurrent costs. ESE would ensure finance for all of the local expenditures, including&#13;
all taxes and duties, related to investment and all of the incremental recurrent costs, to total the Birr equivalent of&#13;
US$5.7 million, or about 18 percent of total project costs.&#13;
4.6     The project costs are summarized by components in the Annex 3, exclusive of the PPF funds. It follows&#13;
from that table that IDA would finance 60 percent (US$10.4 million) of Component I--Seed Enterprise&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
Development; the IDA would finance about 80 percent (US$10.8 million) of Component II- Capacity Building.&#13;
TGE would finance about 8 percent (US$1.3 million) of Component 1, and about 20 percent (US$2.8 million) of&#13;
Component II. ESE would contribute 32 percent (US$5.6 million) towards the financing of Component I and an&#13;
insignificant amount, in terms of taxes and duties for human resource development expenditure, under Component&#13;
II. The PPF total is about US$0.8 million.&#13;
C. Procurement&#13;
4.7    General: It is anticipated that about US$8.3 million (or about 26 percent of total project costs) would be&#13;
awarded under international competitive bidding procedures (ICB). Another US$8.4 million (or 26 percent of total&#13;
project costs) would be procured by applying local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures. Other procurement&#13;
procedures (including shopping, direct contracting, consulting services, and incremental recurrent costs) would&#13;
total US$11.4 million (or about 36 percent of total project costs). IDA procurement procedures would not apply to&#13;
contracts worth US$3.7 million (or approximately 12 percent of the total project costs), which represent cases&#13;
where all of the investment and/or recurrcnt costs would be financed by TGE or ESE.&#13;
4.8    IDA guidelines for procurement would be followed whenever IDA funds are used, regardless of the&#13;
percentage of financing provided by IDA for a particular procurement package; the Bank's standard bidding and&#13;
contract documents would be used for all ICB and consulting services. Two distinct entities would be responsible&#13;
for the procurement under the project. These entities are (a) NSIA; and (b) ESE. Procurement by ESE would be&#13;
subject to supervision by NSIA and would follow IDA guidelines for procurement.&#13;
4.9    NSIA would handle all procurement for civil works, goods (equipment, vehicles, furniture and grains)&#13;
destined for the agency itself (including PCMU), the National Strategic Seed Reserve, the Plant Genetic Resource&#13;
Center (PGRC), the Plant Quarantine Service (PQS), the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) including the Secondary&#13;
Seed Multiplication Scheme (SSMS), Alemaya University of Agriculture (AUA), and the Institute of Agriculture&#13;
Research (IAR); NSIA would also handle all training, technical assistance and studies provided under the project.&#13;
ESE would handle procurement for works, goods and consultancies, identified for the enterprise under the project.&#13;
4.10   Works: It is anticipated that a total of about US$2.6 million would be awarded under the project for civil&#13;
works (about 8 percent of total project costs); all contracts estimated above US$300,000 would be by ICB, while&#13;
contracts below this value, LCB would be followed. The category works includes the construction of stores and&#13;
other civil works identified for the breeder seed units of the research institutes and the university, the&#13;
construction/rehabilitation of limited regional office space at ESE's processing plants, and laboratories for seed&#13;
quality testing (at ESE headquarters and regional processing plants, and for the National Seed Testing Laboratory&#13;
under NSIA). The category works also includes a provision for the land development at a basic seed farm (if&#13;
concluded feasible) which would be operated by ESE; value of land development contracts would total US$0.9&#13;
million (or about 3 percent of total project costs), and each of the anticipated contracts would be less than&#13;
US$300,000. The civil works are widely scattered and, individually, of rather insignificant scale in terms of&#13;
individual contract value, since contracts would in all cases be less than US$150,000 each. Local Competitive&#13;
Bidding (LCB) procedures would be applied for civil works as the interest of foreign contractors is not likely, and&#13;
contractors from within the country would provide adequate competition; however, foreign bidders would be&#13;
allowed to participate if they choose to do so; the same approach applies to the land development contracts.&#13;
4.11   Goods: It is anticipated that about US$14.9 million (or about 47 percent of total project costs) worth of&#13;
goods would be procured under the project. The category goods include seeds and (seed) grains worth the Birr&#13;
equivalent of US$2.9 million for the National Strategic Seed Reserve, equipment in the form of seed processing&#13;
equipment for ESE, seed storage and processing equipment for the basic and breeder seed producing units of the&#13;
AUA and the IAR, a wide range of agricultural equipment (including equipment and tools to be distributed under&#13;
the SSMS to the farmers and the extension workers), laboratory and office equipment and furniture, as well as&#13;
vehicles for NSIA, the implementing agencies, and ESE. It is anticipated that US$8.3 million worth of goods (or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
26 percent of total project costs) would be procured under ICB all with single contract valuCs Cxcccdinlg&#13;
US$100,000; US$5.9 million worth of goods (or about 19 percent of total projcct costs) would be procurcd und(er&#13;
LCB, and individual contracts would in these cases not exceed the US$100,000 threshold; a total of US( 6*r milliorl&#13;
(or about 2 percent of total project costs) for parts of proprietary nature, earmarked specifically for thc&#13;
rehabilitation of ESE's seed processing plants, would be procured under direct contracting. A minor pan of goods&#13;
consisting exclusively of office furniture, and with a total value of about US$0.1 million (and thus less than o c&#13;
percent of total project costs), would be financed for the full 100 perccnt by TGE and ESE. and would, thcreforc&#13;
not be subject to IDA procurement procedures.&#13;

4.12 The project would further provide vehicles for both the Government and for ESE. Government vehicles are.&#13;
with the exception of a few passenger cars for NSIA, mostly pick-ups and four-wheel-drive station wagons which&#13;
are to be used for field work; a provision is made for mules and for bicycles for the extension agents. A total of ten&#13;
large trucks would, in addition to pick-ups, be provided to ESE. Total procurement of vehicles and other modes of&#13;
transport amounts to US$3.8 million (or about 12 percent of total project costs), all of which would be procured by&#13;
ICB, as individual contract values would exceed US$100,000; provision would be made, however, to procure up to&#13;
US$50,000 worth of transport animals under local shopping procedure.&#13;
4.13    Consultancies:  The category of consultancies, totaling US$3.9 million (or about 12 percent of total&#13;
project costs) comprises training: technical assistance, and studies. Training would consist of ooth overseas&#13;
fellowships and local training. The total expenditures for training amount to US$1.8 million (or 6 percent of total&#13;
project costs). A total of US$1.0 million (or about 3 percent of total project costs) is budgeted for technical&#13;
assistance; studies would amount to US$ 1.1 million (or about 3 percent of total project costs). Training would be&#13;
subject to agreed procedures according to a workplan requiring clearance by IDA. and to be prepared on an annual&#13;
basis; the training plans would have to identify candidates, their curriculum vitae (if applicable), type, place.&#13;
timing and costs of the training. Technical assistance and studies would be procured in accordance with IDA's&#13;
"Guidelines for the Use of Consultants".&#13;
4.14    Miscellaneous: Incremental recurrent costs of the project would total about US$9.6 million (or about 30&#13;
percent of total project costs). About US$3.6 million of recurrent costs (or about 11 percent of total project costs)&#13;
would be Non-Bank-Financed (N.B.F.) and refers exclusively to the incremental recurrent costs of ESE. A total of&#13;
US$0.2 million recurrent costs (or less than 0.5 percent of total project costs) would be procured under shopping&#13;
arrangements and relates to purchase of specific consumables for the laboratories. The remaining US$5.8 million&#13;
of incremental recurrent costs (or about 18 percent of total project costs) falls in the procurement category "N.A."&#13;
incremental salaries and maintenance of vehicles, etc., for the government entities only, classified under&#13;
procurement method "Other" in Table 4.3.&#13;
4.15    Annual Procurement Work Program and Procurement Monitoring: An overall Annual Procurement&#13;
Work Program (APWP) would be prepared by NSIA in consultation with ESE and all other government&#13;
agencies/institutions which are to implement the project. The APWP would contain details with respect to each&#13;
agency/institution and ESE on (a) items to be procured and expenditure category: (b) procurement packages; (c)&#13;
estimated cost per package; (d) proposed procurement method; (e) implementation schedule for procurement: while&#13;
(f) Annual Training Program (ATP), to be prepared by the NSIA, would be integrated into the APWP and should&#13;
contain budget, implementation schedule, and other details to be specified and agreed upon. Assurances were&#13;
obtained during negotiations that NSIA would prepare and submit a draft of the first APWP, as a part of its first&#13;
annual work program, prior to credit effectiveness, and that this draft would be finalized during the Project Launch&#13;
Workshop. It was further agreed that subsequent APWP's would be submitted at least two months in advance of the&#13;
project year and that NSIA would finalize Standard Bidding Documents as a condition for project effectiveness.&#13;
4.16    The NSIA would. in addition to the physical and financial quarterly progress reports for the project as a&#13;
whole, prepare, for each period of 6 months, the Procurement Progress Report (PPR). The PPRs would each be&#13;
submitted to IDA within 30 days from completion of the semester. Assurances were obtained during negotiations&#13;
that a suitable format for such reports would be agreed with NSIA during the Project Launch Workshop. The PPR&#13;
would, inter alia, contain the following information:&#13;
(a)    Awarded contracts: by (i) Project component and/or sub-component; (ii) contract number and&#13;
date; (iii) method of procurement; (iv) the name of the country of the successful bidder; (v) value&#13;
and currency of the contract; (vi) major expenditure category; and (vii) expected and actual date&#13;
of contract completion; and (viii) expected and actual dates of receipt of goods.&#13;
(b)    Procurement in Process: (i) Project component and/or sub-component; (ii) total funds allocated&#13;
and name of procurement package; (iii) planned and actual dates of inviting bids; (iv) date of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
opening of bids; (v) date of planned and actual submission of bid evaluation report to IDA; (vi)&#13;
date of clearance by IDA, and (vii) date of award of the contract, name of the&#13;
contractor/supplier/consultant, and value of the contract.&#13;
(c)    Procurement Processing Time: At negotiations standard processing time for procurement&#13;
activities were agreed upon with TGE. and these standard times would be considered in the&#13;
Annual Procurement Work program.&#13;
4.17   Procurement Review by IDA: All contracts with an estimated value in excess of US$100,000 would be&#13;
subject to IDA's prior review procedures. It is anticipated that this would cover about 65 percent of all contracts.&#13;
For contracts of a value equal or less than this threshold, a selective ex-post review (I out of 5) would take place&#13;
during project supenrision. All terms of reference for technical assistance and training would be subject to IDA's&#13;
prior review; consulting contracts with firms in excess of US$100,000. assigned by competitive bidding, and with&#13;
individuals in excess of US$50,000 would be subject to IDA's prior review, as would all single source contracts&#13;
with firms.&#13;
D. Disbursement and the Special Account&#13;
4.18    Disbursement: The project would have a life of five years. A longer duration is not planned because the&#13;
project involves (a) a limited amount of usually slow disbursing civil works; and (b) large amounts of goods and&#13;
vehicles, to be procured mainly in large contracts. Further, the project provides for expert services to strengthen&#13;
procurement capabilities of NSIA. No particular problems are anticipated with the procurement by ESE as this&#13;
enterprise would benefit from consultation and supenrision with NSIA in procurement matters. It appears&#13;
reasonable to assume that the seed enterprise development and the capacity building components would be&#13;
implemented according to schedule. The IDA credit of US$22.0 million is expected to become effective in July&#13;
1995, and would close 66 months later, in the year 2000. Estimated Schedule of Disbursements is in Annex 4.&#13;
4.19    The Special Account: Two special accounts would be established, on terms and conditions acceptable to&#13;
IDA. The first special account would be held in the name of the project by NSIA, and would be maintained in US$&#13;
in a commercial bank acccptable to the Association. IDA would make an initial deposit up to US$1.0 million into&#13;
the special account and thus establish a revolving fund to cover expenditures of NSIA and all the other&#13;
implementing government agencies/institutions, except for ESE. The special account would be replenished&#13;
monthly in accordance with established IDA disbursement procedures. Replenishments would be made against&#13;
fully documented withdrawal applications prepared by NSIA. The special account would be used for contracts&#13;
amounting to less than US$100,000 and replenishment would be made on the basis of Statement of Expenditure&#13;
(SOE). The project would, to the extent possible, use the direct method of disbursement for contracts with a value&#13;
in excess of US$100,000 to ensure liquidity of the special account. NSIA would retain supporting documentation&#13;
on the SOE for inspection by auditors and IDA missions.&#13;
4.20    A second special account would be opened along the same lines as described for NSIA's account above.&#13;
The second special account would be held by ESE, and would be used to facilitate disbursement for this enterprise.&#13;
The Association would again make an initial deposit of up to US$1.0 million; the special account would be used&#13;
for contracts worth US$200,000 or less and replenishments would be made on the basis of SOEs. For contracts of&#13;
higher value the direct method of disbursement would be used. ESE would retain supporting documentation on the&#13;
SOE for inspection by NSIA, auditors and IDA.&#13;

E. Accounts and Audit&#13;
4.21     The management, accounting and budgeting of the project would be entrusted to NSIA which would,&#13;
therefore, coordinate all financial transactions including disbursement requests generated by government entities&#13;
and ESE. NSIA would maintain for this purpose separate records reflecting specific disbursements to the various&#13;
implementing agencies/institutions of the Government and ESE.&#13;
4.22     Assurances were obtained during negotiations that NSIA would maintain all project records in accordance&#13;
with internationally-accepted standards, whereby the agency would put in place the project's financial management&#13;
and accounting system for itself and for the implementing agencies. The accounts would be audited annually by an&#13;
external auditor, acceptable to the Bank. The audit would comprise the auditor's report on the project accounts&#13;
(including balance sheet, operating expenditure statement and sources and applications of funds), the special&#13;
account and the statement of expenditures with respect to the implementing agencies, and the financial statements&#13;
of ESE. The audited accounts, including those of ESE, would be submitted to the Association within six months&#13;
from the close of the fiscal year, to assure that accounts are maintained in conformity with IDA's requirements.&#13;
The project would reserve funds for NSIA to receive assistance from a local accounting firm, acceptable to IDA, to&#13;
help set-up the financial management and accounting system for the Project.&#13;

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Organization and Overall Responsibility&#13;
5.1    The overall responsibility for project implementation would rest with the National Seed Industry Agencv&#13;
(NSIA), set-up by TGE in July 1993 in accordance with TGE's National Seed Industry Policy. NSIA is expected to&#13;
provide effective national guidance and the institutional linkages necessary to secure the overall development of the&#13;
seed sector. NSIA works under a policy advisorv body, the National Seed Industry Council (NSIC). NSIC is the&#13;
apex institution for the seed sector with primary responsibility for providing policy and national guidance,&#13;
reviewing and monitoring the overall development and promoting capacity building. Assurances were obtained&#13;
during negotiations that NSIC would review the implementation progress of the project at regular intervals,&#13;
preferably once a quarter, and resolve bottlenecks, if any, that may impede progress. The General Manager of&#13;
NSIA would be the counterpart of IDA's Task Manager for the Project. A small Project Coordination and&#13;
Monitoring Unit (PCMU) would be set up. within NSIA for the duration of the project, to have a focal point for&#13;
the Seed Systems Development Project (SSDP).&#13;
B. Project Implementation Plan&#13;
5.2    General: A preliminary Project Implementation Plan (PIP) is shown in Annex 9. The PIP outlines the&#13;
implementation arrangements, as well as the Project Implementation Schedule for each component of the project,&#13;
in Attachment 1 of Annex 9. Key Monitorable Indicators are shown in Annex 9, Attachment 2. The Project&#13;
Supervision Plan, describing TGE and IDA roles, is shown in Annex 10. Procurement Packages, duly classified&#13;
according to procurement categories, are shown in Annex 11. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that&#13;
NSIA would follow the implementation arrangements as described in Annex 9--Project Implementation Plan.&#13;
5.3    The project would be implemented by several agencies, but NSIA would bear the overall responsibility,&#13;
including project coordination by its PCMU; this unit would have a monitoring, reporting and facilitating role, and&#13;
would ensure: (a) maintenance of proper project accounts by each implementing agency; and (b) orderly and timely&#13;
submission of withdrawal applications, and finalization of periodical reports and other information requested by&#13;
IDA. This PCMIU arrangement is expected to ensure better sustainability of the seed sector development, including&#13;
development of a competitive seed marketing system, and capacity building programs. Expenditures for salaries of&#13;
PCMU staff, to be recruited on a contract basis for the life of the project, would be covered by IDA. In addition,&#13;
the IDA credit would play a significant role in providing resources for upgrading office technology, improving&#13;
mobility and for capacity building within NSIA and the other implementing agencies.&#13;
5.4    National Seed Industry Agency (NSIA): Assurances were obtained during negotiation that NSIA, and&#13;
PCMU within NSIA, would be staffed as per the agreed Organizational Chart shown in Annex 7, and TGE would&#13;
provide adequate office accommodation. The recruitment of all PCMU staff, plus at least a SSMS specialist, a&#13;
procurement officer, a training specialist and a business specialist is a condition of credit effectiveness. Further, the&#13;
qualifications and terms and conditions of employment of staff in the PCMU would be satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
Further, assurances were obtained by IDA during negotiations that the Government would provide adequate office&#13;
facilities and timely budgetary and staffing support to NSIA, so that the latter can undertake assigned project&#13;
responsibilities in a timely and efficient manner.&#13;
5.5    NSIA would have overall responsibility for design and implementation of two major sub-components,&#13;
wvith the full cooperation of the concerned agencies. These subcomponents are (a) the Secondary Seed&#13;
Multiplication Scheme (SSMS), under the informal sector seed enterprise development; and (b) the Support to&#13;
Private Sector Development, under the formal sector seed enterprise development, particularly when it comes to&#13;
promoting the role of seedsmen and other small- to medium-scale seed enterprises (paras 3.17 and 3.18 and Annex&#13;
9). Towards this end, NSIA would hire qualified experts (consultants), would formulate workplans and timetables&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
for action, install a monthly review mechanism to monitor progress of the various project components, and would&#13;
address emerging problems by seeking solutions. NSIA would also be responsible for organizing the Feasibility&#13;
Study on the National Seed Security Stock Reserve, with particular focus on the chronically drought-prone areas;&#13;
NSIA would further ensure that arrangements for implementation of the agreed recommendations are in place.&#13;
5.6    Assurances were obtained during negotiations that NSIA would (a) organize, in coordination with the&#13;
Government and IDA, a Project Launch Workshop to help the borrower complete remaining actions promptly, and&#13;
to familiarize the borrower and the implementing agencies with Bank procedures, especially procurement,&#13;
disbursement, reporting. and auditing; (b) organize an annual national workshop on seed with active participation&#13;
of research and extension staff, the Regional Agricultural Bureaus, ESE, the private seed producers and/or&#13;
marketers, and representatives of farmers, with the objective to review progress of the project in the preceding year,&#13;
and outline the program for the upcoming year; (c) organize a workshop on procurement and disbursement; (d)&#13;
maintain a close liaison with the Regional Agricultural Bureaus, by organizing quarterly meetings, as well as a&#13;
number of field visits; (e) make arrangements for a Mid-Term Project Review (not later than six months from the&#13;
close of Project Year 2) to evaluate physical, financial and institutional achievements for each component and&#13;
agree on the actions to be taken for the remainder of the project life; (f) make arrangements for the annual audit, by&#13;
external auditors satisfactory to IDA, of project accounts (including special accounts and statements of&#13;
expenditure) for NSIA and the implementing agencies, and submit the audit report to IDA within six months from&#13;
close of the fiscal year; and (g) coordinate all technical assistance, training and studies. NSIA would further set&#13;
up, with appropriate assistance of a local accounting firm, a proper accounting system for itself as well as for the&#13;
implementing agencies; the existence of such system is a condition of credit effectiveness.&#13;
5.7      Assurances were obtained during negotiations that NSIA would submit, two months prior to the start of&#13;
each project year, the Annual Workplan of the Project and would further ensure implementation of such plan once&#13;
it has been approved by IDA. The Annual Workplan of the Project would include (a) the Annual Procurement&#13;
Workplan (APWP); (b) staff deployment; (c) details of technical assistance and studies to be arranged during the&#13;
year, with target dates for approval of terms of reference, short lists, appointments and execution of the tasks; (d)&#13;
details of the training program for the year, whereby specific details would be provided for local training (type of&#13;
training, location, proposed date, number of beneficiaries and trainers, whereby the latter would be identified by&#13;
name, discipline and institution, and estimated costs) and overseas training (name of the trainees, their curriculum&#13;
vitae, field of study and justification of the course, period and place of training, as well as the estimated cost; and&#13;
(e) details of expenditure projection by quarters, source of funding (Government, IDA, other donors), and required&#13;
flow of funds from the Government with target dates for release. The Workplan for Project Year 1 would be&#13;
submitted to IDA prior to credit effectiveness and finalized during the Project Launch Workshop. Assurances were&#13;
obtained during negotiations that NSIA would set up a Project Implementation Committee (PIC), with suitable&#13;
private sector representatives, to review progress and take appropriate action on a monthly basis.&#13;
5.8    Ministry of Agriculture (MOA): MOA would play a critical role in the efficient implementation of the&#13;
Secondary Seed Multiplication Scheme (para 3.9) and in creating mass awareness, among the farmers, about the&#13;
benefits from use of improved seeds. MOA would collaborate closely with NSIA and provide effective guidance to&#13;
the regional agricultural bureaus. It would annually set targets for training of peasants through its field extension&#13;
staff and ensure efficient implementation of the SSMS. Assurances were obtained during negotiations for MOA to&#13;
submit the annual work program for seed sector development (including SSMS), together with a review of the&#13;
achievements and problems of the preceding year, to NSIA prior to the start of each project year.&#13;
5.9    Ethiopian Seed Entcrprise (ESE):  Assurances were obtained during negotiations that ESE would&#13;
implement its restructuring plan and furnish six-month progress reports to NSIA/NSIC.  The satisfactory&#13;
implementation of the restructuring plan is crucial for the project. Further, ESE would annually prepare a business&#13;
plan which would, inter alia, review the physical and financial progress of the previous year and targets for the&#13;
following year. The business plan would spell out the progress achieved in the rehabilitation of the regional seed&#13;
processing units, the implementation of the enterprise its new marketing strategy and the progress made with the&#13;
installation and the operation of the Management Information System. The ESE would further submit six-month&#13;
progress reports in agreed formats to NSIA. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that ESE would submit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
(a) its annual business plan to IDA through NSIA at least two months prior to the commencement of each project&#13;
year, and take IDA's comments into consideration before finalizing it; (b) its annual audited statement of accounts&#13;
within six months of the close of each fiscal year; and (c) half-yearly progress reports.&#13;
5.10    Breeder Seed Program: IAR and AUA would submit an annual work program to IDA through NSIA for&#13;
review each year. The annual work program would include, but not necessarily be limited to, the targets for&#13;
breeder seed production, a time table for design, construction and installation of laboratory equipment for breeder&#13;
seed units in the research centers, construction of storage facilities and a compact seed laboratory. In addition, both&#13;
the institutions would send six-month progress reports to NSIA for onward transmission to IDA, in a format to be&#13;
agreed with IDA during Projcct Launch Workshop.&#13;
5.11    Private Sector: The Implementation of the Seed Systems Development Project would require active&#13;
participation by the private sector. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that NSIA would ensure that&#13;
representatives of the private seed sector, both formal and informal, are given adequate opportunity to participate&#13;
in the deliberations of SSDP's Project Implementation Committee. Moreover. both the public and the private sector&#13;
would be invited to attend the meetings of NSIC. when SSDP quarterly progress would be reviewed. Further, the&#13;
public and the private sector would be represented in all other committees, set up for the implementation of the&#13;
project.&#13;
5.12    Quality Control Legislation and its Enforcement: While The Ethiopian Standards Authority would&#13;
update and/or set up, as appropriate, seed standards, NSIA would process the enactment of a seed law and the&#13;
formulation or rules and regulations under the law. The enforcement of the law would be the responsibility of the&#13;
Seed Quality Control and Seed Certification Services staff who would be specially trained and empowered to&#13;
discharge this responsibility. Assurances were obtained during negotiations from TGE to the effect that the legal&#13;
framework for enforcement of quality control and seed certification would be in place by December 31, 1995 and&#13;
that, in the meanwhile, all commercial seed would be truthfully labeled on a voluntary basis.&#13;
5.13    Regional Bureaus of Agriculture: The newly created regional bureaus of agriculture would play the&#13;
most critical role in Project implementation. NSIA and MOA would have to collaborate actively with the regional&#13;
administrations, and guide and facilitate project implementation, and ensure that adequate facilities in terms of&#13;
equipment and staff training are provided to the agricultural bureaus. This would be particularly important for the&#13;
informal sector and for assisting seedsmen (paras 3.8, 3.9 and 3.17). Further, the inputs unit in the regional&#13;
agricultural bureaus, to be set up in each region under the Seed Systems Development Project would coordinate&#13;
and monitor the implementation of SSMS in the regions.&#13;
5.14    Capacity Building: NSIA would coordinate and implement the capacity building component of the&#13;
project. The need for technical assistance and the training requirements would be identified systematically and&#13;
well before the beginning of each project year by each of the implementing agencies; these requirements would be&#13;
reviewed and cleared by NSIA, and detailed arrangements made for efficient implementation.  IDA's prior&#13;
agreement would be required for all courses and staff selected for overseas training; the same applies to the&#13;
recruitment of expatriate technical assistance as well as foreign study tours, financed under the project. NSIA has&#13;
presented preliminary, sufficiently detailed requirements for technical assistance and training for Project Year 1,&#13;
during negotiations, the final technical tssistance and training programs would include all comments given by IDA&#13;
and would be finalized during the Project Launch Workshop.  Detailed annual requirements for technical&#13;
assistance and training would, in subsequent project years, be sent by NSIA to IDA at least one month in advance&#13;
of the new project year. Terms of reference for technical assistance and conditions of employment would require&#13;
the approval by IDA. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that NSIA would implement technical&#13;
assistance and training in accordance with the outline in Annex 8.&#13;
5.15    Reports: Assurances were obtained during negotiations that NSIA would submit quarterly progress&#13;
reports in a standardized format, to be agreed during the Project Launch Workshop.&#13;

VI. FINANCIAL, ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
A. Financial Aspects&#13;
6.1     General: The financial aspects of the Project have been analyzed separately for the Ethiopian Seed&#13;
Enterprise (ESE) and at the farm level. The detailed financial analysis of ESE covers the base year 1994, and&#13;
projections for the period 1995 to 2000. The farm level financial analysis relates to the profitability of using&#13;
improved seeds only.&#13;
6.2    Financial Analysis of the Ethiopian Seed Enterprise: The financial performance of ESE (hitherto&#13;
ESC) was poor during the period 1986/87 to 1990/91, when prices of commercial seed and all agricultural produce&#13;
were set by the Government. During these years, ESE incurred severe losses, which totaled Biff 3.3 million in&#13;
fiscal year 1990/91, thereby eroding the net equity position of the corporation. Financial projections, prepared in&#13;
early 1991, at the appraisal stage of the project, were gloomy for the period 1991/92 to 1995/96. It was then&#13;
concluded that it would take the enterprise quite some time to restore profitability through adjustments in&#13;
management practices and, above all, market conditions. The now outdated projections showed a modest profit of&#13;
Birr 0.6 million for the fiscal year 1996/97.&#13;
6.3    However, over the past 1991/92 to 1993/94 fiscal years, the financial performance of ESE has been far&#13;
better than previously anticipated. The enterprise has, in every year since fiscal year 1991/92 made a profit, and&#13;
consolidated its sales at about 15,000 tons of seeds per year; this has resulted in a (provisional) profit (before taxes&#13;
and appropriation to Government) of about Birr 3.8 million in the year 1993/94, or the last year for which&#13;
historical financial data are available. A summary of ESE's detailed financial position for fiscal year 1993/94 is&#13;
shown in the tables of Annex 6 (income statement, sources and applications of funds, and balance sheets); the same&#13;
tables include the re-appraisal mission's revised financial projections (in constant prices of 1994) of ESE until the&#13;
year 2000. The last audit report of ESE refers to the fiscal year 1991/92; other reports on ESE's financial position&#13;
are available only in provisional form. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that ESE would have its&#13;
accounts audited to include the fiscal year 1993/94; ESE would submit the 1993/94 Audit report and the&#13;
provisional accounts for 1994/95 to the Association by July 7, 1995&#13;
6.4    For the purpose of financial projections, it is conservatively assumed that the enterprise would maintain&#13;
revenues from sales of seed (and by-products) at the 1993/94 level of Birr 45.5 million in all of the years to come&#13;
(even though in all probability the turnover of the enterprise may, in terms of sales volume and value, significantly&#13;
improve). It is further assumed that the costs of goods produced would, except for incremental costs of operation&#13;
and maintenance resulting from investment under the project, remain constant at Birr 33.0 million.&#13;
6.5    It is anticipated that ESE would invest, including physical contingencies (in 1994 constant prices and thus&#13;
excluding price contingencies), Birr 43.0 million under the project. Part of this investment, totaling Binf 15.6&#13;
million, would result from the establishment of a new basic seed farm, once a feasibility study is completed and&#13;
conclusions favor such investment. The remaining investment, Biff 27.4 million, follows from the upgrading of&#13;
ESE's management and marketing capacity, as well as improvement of its seed processing facilities through&#13;
rehabilitation of equipment and strengthening of seed testing facilities.&#13;
6.6    It is assumed that Birr 20.9 million, or about 75 percent of the capital outlay of Birr 27.4 million, would&#13;
be financed with IDA funds, to be on-lent, by TGE to ESE, to cover the foreign exchange requirements of the&#13;
investment. TGE would on-lend the IDA funds to ESE on the following conditions: (a) the loan would bear a&#13;
positive interest rate of 10 percent (representing current practice for commercial loans at 14 percent, less inflation);&#13;
(b) the loan would be repayable in 10 years in equal annual installments; (c) the first annuity would be payable one&#13;
year from loan effectiveness; and (d) the enterprise would bear the foreign exchange risk. It is further anticipated&#13;
that ESE would finance Birr 6.5 million, or about 25 percent of the capital outlay of the Birr 27.4 million&#13;
investment from its own resources. Assurances were obtained during negotiations on the above-mentioned on-&#13;
lending terms, and that ESE would finance the remainder investment from its own resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
6.7     Overhead costs are maintained in the financial projections at Birr 4.8 million in the years preceding the&#13;
completion of the Birr 27.4 million investment; they are assumed to increase by Birr 3.3 million, from 1996&#13;
onwards, to cover the incremental costs of operation and maintenance related specifically to the Birr 27.4 million&#13;
investment. It was agreed with ESE that the enterprise would clarify its position relating to the outstanding debt&#13;
and arrears with the Government (capital charge, short-term loan, and the taxes and contributions payable) by the&#13;
end of the fiscal year 1995. Further, it was agreed during negotiations with ESE. that the enterprise would follow a&#13;
stricter financial management, allowing to reduce, by the year 2000, accounts receivable and inventories to 60&#13;
percent. and accounts payable to about 25 percent of the 1994 levels.&#13;
6.8     The financial projections show that profits are expected to average about Birr 0. I million in each of the&#13;
years between 1996 and 2000, thereby allowing ESE to slowly rebuild its net equity. More importantly, it is&#13;
anticipated that the enterprise would have a satisfactory cash-flow during these years to (a) contribute from its own&#13;
resources Birr 6.5 million towards Birr 27.4 million investment foreseen for the year 1996; (b) service its debt; (c)&#13;
cover its working capital requirements; and (d) contribute Birr 5.2 million, towards the financing for the&#13;
establishment of the (third) basic seed farm from its own resources at a later stage (1998), and also to service an&#13;
additional loan of Birr 10.4 million, for the aforementioned basic seed farm, once the feasibility of such a farm is&#13;
detailed.&#13;
6.9     The financial (net) cash-flow analysis reveals that the Birr 27.4 million investment, proposed by the&#13;
project for ESE during the initial years of the project, would yield a (real) rate of return, on all resources employed,&#13;
of 8.2 percent. The return on ESE's own resources would be 7.8 percent. Both returns are based on a scenario of a&#13;
15 percent annual reduction in revenues in the "Without the Project" situation, due to the gradual deterioration of&#13;
the enterprise's production capacity and/or deterioration of the quality of seeds. All of ESE's financial ratios show&#13;
satisfactory values. Assurances were obtained during negotiations for ESE to include the financial ratios, as shown&#13;
in Annex 6, in the Management Information System and the progress reports.&#13;
6.10    Farm  Level Financial Aspects Related to Use of Improved Seeds:  The financial profitability of&#13;
improved seed use is expressed in terms of the value cost ratio on the basis of the following assumptions: (a) yields&#13;
reflect the technology package as available to the typical peasant farmer; (b) the "Base", or "Without the Project",&#13;
situation represents the situation without improved seeds and with negligible use of fertilizer; and (c) the "With&#13;
the Project" situation represents the situation with availability of improved seeds, and the same negligible use of&#13;
fertilizer as in the "Without the Project" situation.  The use of improved seeds would allow, under the&#13;
aforementioned conditions, an increase in the yields of various crops (teff, barley, wheat, sorghum and maize) by as&#13;
much as 10 to 15 percent; an average of 12.5 percent is assumed as the yield increase in the analysis hereafter.&#13;
The use of improved seeds would allow reduction of seeding rates by as much as 20 percent for all crops except&#13;
sorghum; the improved seed, obtained from the formal sector, has been valued at 1.8 times the price of ordinary&#13;
grain. The profitability of improved seed use is summarized in Table 6. 1.&#13;
6.11    Table 6.1 indicates that the yield increase for a peasant farmer would range from a maximum of 0.15 ton&#13;
to a minimum of 0.08 ton per hectare, due exclusively to the use of improved seeds. Incremental costs of&#13;
production are a function of seed only when no other inputs are envisaged; the incremental labor costs for&#13;
harvesting are valued at zero as the proposed crop budgets reflect the peasant agriculture, where on-farm family&#13;
labor is abundant and no use is made of a hired work force. The table further shows that the value cost ratios range&#13;
from a maximum of 12 for sorghum to a minimum of 2.3 for barley. The ratios are thus above the threshold value&#13;
of two, which is generally accepted as the minimum below which the farmer would not give consideration to the&#13;
improved technology.&#13;

B. Economic Aspects&#13;
6.12    General: The project's net contribution to the national economy has been calculated by following the&#13;
format of a conventional economic cash-flow analysis in which both the costs and the benefits are expressed&#13;
exclusive of any form of transfer payments, viz., taxes, duties, subsidies. interest, etc.; tradable goods and services&#13;
are shadow priced, while the non-tradables are valued by using market prices. The economic analysis has been&#13;
performed in constant prices of 1994.&#13;
6.13    Economic Costs: The economic costs of the project. exclusive of taxes, duties, subsidies on investment&#13;
and recurrent costs, are summarized, by project components in Table 6.2.&#13;

6.14    Economic Benefits: The economic benefits of the project are tangible and come in the form of the net&#13;
value of (incremental) agricultural production, following increased availability and use of improved seeds. There&#13;
are three sources of improved seeds under the project. These sources are: (a) the ESE, (b) the Secondary Seed&#13;
Multiplication Scheme (SSMS); and (c) seedsmen and small to medium size seed entrepreneurs. The economic&#13;
analysis is performed by considering only the impact of ESE and SSMS seeds, due to the uncertainty associated&#13;
with the emerging seed entrepreneurs.&#13;
6.15    It appears reasonable to assume that every kilogram of seed produced by ESE would benefit from the&#13;
important improvements envisaged for internal quality control and the up-grading of the processing facilities&#13;
within the enterprise, as well as from improvements in the quality of breeder seed produced by the research stations&#13;
and basic seed produced on ESE's farms. Annual seed sales of ESE have stabilized at about 15,000 tons; the sales&#13;
could, however, grow to as much as 30.000 tons per year, based on the size of the market. The ESE could cope&#13;
with such demand increases by augmenting the area under seed production contracts and by increasing the number&#13;
of production shifts at its seed processing plants. The economic benefits relating to ESE seed sales have, however,&#13;
been based on average annual seed sales of 15,000 tons only, similarly to the approach used in the financial&#13;
analysis of the enterprise.&#13;
6.16    The total area to benefit from improved seed produced by ESE is obtained by allowing for a seed rate of&#13;
100 kg per hectare; it is further assumed that seed would be replenished by the farmers, on average, only once&#13;
every five years. One hundred and fifty thousand hectares would thus benefit annually from the improved seed&#13;
originating from ESE, starting in the year following the rehabilitation of the seed processing equipment and the&#13;
establishment of the seed testing facilities. The area to benefit from ESE's improved seed (i.e., commercial seed)&#13;
would expand each year thereafter with another 150,000 hectares, until the area reaches 750,00 hectares. It is&#13;
assumed that (a) improved ESE seed would be available for the first time in Project Year three; and (b) the yield&#13;
increase would, on average, be about 100 kilograms per hectare.  This approach results in 15,000 tons of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
incremental production in the third project Year, 30,000 tons in year four, 45,000 tons in year five, and so on, until&#13;
the incremental production stabilizes at an annual volume of 75,000 tons in the seventh year from the start of the&#13;
project. In economic terms, it is anticipated that the benefits would grow from Birr 27 million in year three. to Birr&#13;
135 million in year seven and after.&#13;

6.17     The benefits from the SSMS have been calculated along the same principles as those deriving from the&#13;
use of improved seed produced by ESE. In the case of the SSMS, the production of grains would, based on the&#13;
distribution of seed mini-packs, be 200 tons by the end of Project Year one, 350 tons by the end of the second&#13;
Project Year, 600 tons by the end of the third Project Year, to increase to 1,050 tons by Project Year four, and&#13;
further to 1,600 tons by the end of Project Year five. However, not all of the grains thus produced would be&#13;
used/exchanged/sold, as seed, by the farmers, who also have to cater to the needs of their families. It is&#13;
conservatively assumed that only 20 percent of the incremental grains thus produced would be used as seed in the&#13;
subsequent year. Twenty percent of 2,000 hectares (assuming a seed rate of 100 kilograms per hectare) or 400&#13;
hectare would thus benefit from improved seed in the second project year as a result of the SSMS, another 1,100&#13;
hectares in Project Year three, and so on, until a point is reached where the annual area benefiting from improved&#13;
SSMS seed is 16,000 hectares. The SSMS benefits would thus gradually increase from about Biff 0.1 million in&#13;
Project Year two, to Birr 2.9 million in Project Year ten, and after.&#13;
6.18          Net Cash-flow, Economic Rate of Return, Net Present Value and Benefit Cost Ratio and&#13;
Switching Values: The (economic) net cash-flow of the project is shown in Table 6.4. Incremental recurrent&#13;
costs are shown separately from investment, while the benefits reflect the values in Table 6.3.&#13;
6.19    The economic (internal) rate of return (EIRR) is 36 percent and thus well above the 10 percent cut-off&#13;
rate, representing an approximation of the opportunity cost of capital in the country. The NPV is, at a discount&#13;
rate of 10 percent, about Birr 410 million. The Benefit Cost Ratio is at the same discount rate of about 3.0. The&#13;
switching values, calculated on the basis of a discount rate of 10 percent, are minus 66 percent for total benefits,&#13;
and 197 percent for total costs, indicating that there is a substantial margin, both on the benefit and the costs side,&#13;
to guarantee that the project meets the minimum level of economic acceptability. It is, therefore, concluded that the&#13;
Seed Systems Development Project would contribute significantly to economic growth of the country.&#13;

C. Project Benefits and Sustainability&#13;
6.20    Project Benefits: Direct Project benefits would consist of an increase in agricultural productivity and&#13;
production. During the project implementation years the benefits would total 90,000 tons of grains; the impact of&#13;
the project would continue after project completion and would total about 800,000 tons of additional grains. The&#13;
benefits would, on average, reduce the basic food deficit of the country by some six percent. Indirect benefits would&#13;
relate to some alleviation of poverty in the areas under SSMS and in improved employment opportunities, not only&#13;
in ESE, but also in farming and non-farming, particularly as a result of private sector development in trade. The&#13;
project would, further, improve food security in drought-prone areas, and therefore would contribute to poverty&#13;
alleviation.&#13;
6.21     Project Sustainability:  Project sustainability would, only to a very limited extent, depend on the&#13;
Government's budgetary contributions. ESE is an autonomous, commercially-oriented, public enterprise and is, as&#13;
such, not entitled to operational grants, or any other form of subsidy from the Government. Moreover, with the&#13;
free pricing of seeds, consistent with the national seed policy, no subsidies would be involved. The breeders would&#13;
develop an appropriate pricing mechanism to recover their costs from the sales of seeds to ESE and the private&#13;
sector; similarly, ESE would charge full costs for basic seed sold to seed growers. The SSMS would be&#13;
implemented through the extension staff of the MOA and would, therefore, not pose additional budgetary burdens&#13;
on the Government.&#13;
D. Project Risks&#13;
6.22    There are four main risks associated with the project. The first risk is related to the uncertainties caused&#13;
by the ongoing changes in the economic, political, administrative and institutional structures, and the devolution of&#13;
powers to the regions. A related risk is that the successor government to TGE could possibly have different&#13;
policies. These risks, though real, are not rated high as there are no viable alternatives for TGE, or its successor&#13;
government, to change the course or speed of economic reforms. The second risk relates to the possible inadequate&#13;
response by the private sector. This risk is not rated high in view of the past two to three years of experience&#13;
relating to the private sector entering the agricultural inputs business. The investment required for entering into&#13;
the seed business is small when compared to other agricultural inputs, like fertilizers and pesticides. Private&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38-&#13;
commercial farms, which came into existence in the last couple of years, have already entered into seed production&#13;
contracts with ESE. The third risk is that ESE may not quickly and effectively restructure itself into a slim, viable&#13;
and more efficient organization. While the possibilitv of this risk materializing cannot be ruled out, provision has&#13;
been made for adequate technical assistance to help ESE. Furthermore, ESE would be required to annually submit&#13;
its business plan, which would be reviewed by its Board of Directors, NSIC and IDA. NSIA would have the&#13;
responsibility to follow-up, and provide ESE with advice, when necessary. The fourth risk is that NSIA. which is a&#13;
nascent institution, may not be able to build up adequate capacity to implement and monitor progress of vanous&#13;
agencies. This risk, too, is real. The project, therefore, has appropriate conditionally for NSIA to appoint all the&#13;
agreed professional staff prior to credit effectiveness.  It is expected that, because of TGE's demonstrated&#13;
commitment to the project, such a contingency may not arise.&#13;
E. Environmental Aspects&#13;
6.23    The project has been rated Category B for environmental assessment, as the environmental issues to be&#13;
addressed are limited and narrow in scope. The main issue relates to pest management and use of pesticides in&#13;
seed production and processing. Pesticide use includes seed dressings, applied either at a seed processing plant or&#13;
at the user level, to control seed-borne or soil-borne pests and diseases, treatment or fumigation of stored seeds to&#13;
control post-harvest pests and diseases, and field application of pesticides to protect growing plants. Currently, the&#13;
use of such pesticides is negligible, and there are no sufficient environmental or social dangers to merit a separate&#13;
mitigation plan. The recently enacted National Pesticide Legislation is to introduce a pesticide registration scheme&#13;
which would set standards for pesticides importation. production and use in Ethiopia. In the meantime, biocide&#13;
guidelines and the negative list of pesticides (Annex 13) are considered adequate to handle the environmental&#13;
risks. However during the training of farmers and extension agents, emphasis would be placed on the safe&#13;
handling and use of all pesticides.&#13;
&#13;

VII. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
7.1    The following assurances were obtained during negotiations:&#13;
(a)    NSIC would (i) review at regular intervals, preferably on a quarterly basis, the implementation&#13;
progress of the project, including the policy related aspects, and take measures to resolve any&#13;
bottlenecks that may impede project progress (para 5.1); and (ii) ensure that both the public and&#13;
private sectors are represented in the NSIC, during SSDP review, and in all SSDP committees at&#13;
various levels (para 5.11); and (iii) review the progress of ESE's restructunng process at least&#13;
once every six months (para 5.9).&#13;
(b)    NSIA would assist ESE in implementing its new marketing strategy and would provide training&#13;

SEED SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
PILOT INITIATIVE: PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT&#13;
General Description&#13;
1.    In seed program development, the seed requirements of all parties playing a role in agricultural&#13;
production have to be met. As far as the crops are concerned, a broad-based distinction can be made&#13;
between strategic staple crops like maize, sorghum, teff, wheat, barley, pulses and oilseeds, and high&#13;
value crops like vegetables, fruits, flowers, potatoes and hybrid agricultural crops. The former are&#13;
grown mainly by the poor peasant population, the latter by the more developed farming communities.&#13;
Seed supply of (non-hybrid) staple crops is characterized by low profit margins, whereas seed supply&#13;
of high value crops and hybrid staple crops is characterized by relatively high profit margins. To cater&#13;
to the seed requirements of the population, the project proposes to develop a diversified approach:&#13;
(a)    Ethiopian Seed Enterprise (ESE)-to produce high quality certified or truthfully&#13;
labeled seed of staple crops for seed end-users, including input-responsive farmers,&#13;
larger scale commercial farms and the peasant sector.&#13;
(b)    Secondary Seed Multiplication Schemes (SSMS)-to produce non-certified seed at the&#13;
village level, in various organizational models. This seed will be considerably cheaper&#13;
than ESE seed, thus catering to the poor peasant farmer end-user, mostly on a barter&#13;
basis.&#13;
(c)    Seedsmen/Seed  Farmer Groups-to  produce, process and  market commercial&#13;
(truthfully labeled) seed of staple crops on a medium scale in competition with ESE.&#13;
(d)    Other Seed Enterprises-to produce, process and market certified/truthfully labeled&#13;
seeds of different crops. functioning as wholesalers, retailers for ESE certified or&#13;
truthfully labeled seed, joint venture seed enterprises, fruit tree/seedling nurseries, etc.&#13;
Seedsmen/Seed Farmer Groups&#13;
2.     Experience has shown that in countries that have liberalized their seed programs the&#13;
production, processing and marketing of high yielding varieties of staple crops is taken up by the&#13;
private sector.  Seedsmen, usually leading progressive farmers or local businessmen dealing in&#13;
agricultural inputs, and/or small groups of seed farmers may decide to produce seed on a commercial,&#13;
medium scale. These developments will be actively stimulated by the National Seed Industry Agency&#13;
(NSIA) under the Seed Systems Development Project (SSDP).&#13;
3.     The prerequisites for the evolution of seedsmen and seed farmer groups are (a) access to credit&#13;
facilities; (b) access to the required technological know-how; (c) access to basic/certified seed of&#13;
improved and high yielding varieties; and (d) a market-based pricing system for seed. As seedsmen&#13;
and seed farmer groups are likely to produce crops and varieties similar to those of ESE, they will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
compete with ESE on a regional level. For the developments described above to take place, therefore,&#13;
it is essential that ESE prices its seed at non-subsidized market prices, as pricing of public seed below&#13;
cost recovery levels will preclude the entry into the seed business by the private sector.&#13;
Seed Enterprises&#13;
4.     The evolution of various forms of seed enterprises will only occur in a country if and when a&#13;
liberal investment climate has been created by the Government. Tax concessions or holidays, free flow&#13;
of gerrnplasm (import/export of seeds and other planting materials), market-based pricing of seed and a&#13;
liberal marketing system of agricultural products, access by seed enterprises to credit facilities, and the&#13;
availability of agricultural inputs and other requirements, are all relevant tools in this context.&#13;
5.     Various legal forms of seed enterprises may occur, e.g., local private enterprises, joint&#13;
ventures between local and foreign companies, joint stock companies between foreign companies and&#13;
local individual/shareholders; registration of foreign companies in Ethiopia to produce seed locally,&#13;
solely for export purposes (labor-intensive production of hybrid flower/vegetable seeds); establishment&#13;
of local companies which produce seed for export on behalf of foreign seed companies; and&#13;
establishment of wholesale and retail agents, etc.&#13;
6.     These activities may include any or all of the activities from plant breeding to seed marketing.&#13;
The seed supply of crops which have a relatively high profit margin for farmers will consequently be&#13;
the seeds on which the private sector will concentrate: forage seeds; vegetable/horticultural seeds;&#13;
seed potatoes; hybrid agricultural seeds; fruit tree nurseries; seedling nurseries; and flower seeds.&#13;
7.     A minimum of about ten private seed enterprises are expected to be supported under the&#13;
proposed project (see para 12).&#13;
Credit Facilities&#13;
8.     Although a distinction has been made between seedsmen/seed farmer groups and seed&#13;
enterprise development, in this section all come under the heading of private sector seed enterprises.&#13;
Private sector seed related activities must answer to the criteria of profitability, regardless of crops or&#13;
activity involved. Once an "enabling environment" for private seed enterprises has been created, one&#13;
of the major conditions for the development of this sector is access to credit facilities. In this regard&#13;
NSIA will play a crucial role.&#13;
9.     It is difficult to estimate at present how many private seed enterprises will evolve during the&#13;
project period, or which activities/crops they will deal with. In this regard, NSIA will have to&#13;
function as a catalyst; much therefore depends on the quality and dedication of NSIA staff.&#13;
10.    The basic requirement for access to credit is a bankable feasibility study. Many development&#13;
banks have been established by multilateral and bilateral donors to stimulate and facilitate private&#13;
enterprise development in developing countries. Financing conditions with these development banks&#13;
are usually very attractive.  In particular, pilot schemes and private seed enterprise development&#13;
initiatives would appear to meet their assistance criteria. Examples of agencies with this type of&#13;
financing facilities are: the African Project Development Facility (APDF), African Enterprise Fund of&#13;
the IFC (AEF), Commonwealth Development Cooperation (CDC), European Community (EC),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Swedish Agency for International, Technical and Economic Cooperation (BITS), German Finance&#13;
Company for Investments in Developing Countries (DEG), Finnish Fund for Industrial Development&#13;
Cooperation (FINNFUND), Netherlands Development Finance Company (FMO), and USAID.&#13;
However, a major source of funding is likely to come from the two Ethiopian Banks, namely,&#13;
Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB) and the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia. Both&#13;
these Banks are willing to finance private seed enterprises on suitable terms.&#13;
National Seed Industry Agency&#13;
11.    The role of the National Seed Industry Agency (NSIA) is crucial to the development of the&#13;
proposed private sector seed initiatives in Ethiopia. NSIA would advise private entrepreneurs on the&#13;
preparation of viable projects in any aspect of the seed program. Under the project, it would assist&#13;
entrepreneurs to prepare market, technical, and other feasibility studies needed for project preparation.&#13;
It would also identify promising entrepreneurs and help them organize, diversify and expand their&#13;
business, and work with them throughout the project preparation cycle until they secure funding from&#13;
local banks and/or from the development agencies listed above.&#13;
12.    The project would make provisions for NSIA to support these enterprises with a lump sum&#13;
provision of $1.0 million to be spent on advisory services and techno-economic feasibility studies to&#13;
support private sector initiatives.&#13;
13.    NSIA's overall objective under this pilot would be to initiate productive enterprises in the seed&#13;
subsector. In particular, the NSIA would (a) mobilize the private sector through workshops, seminars&#13;
and advertisements; (b) help entrepreneurs to formulate and screen project ideas on a direct and&#13;
confidential basis; (c) provide guidance and, on a selective basis, make technical services available to&#13;
entrepreneurs for project preparation and bankable feasibility studies to promote and implement sound&#13;
projects in the seed subsector; (d) help entrepreneurs with viable project proposals to identify and&#13;
obtain appropriate technical and managerial personnel and, if needed, technical partners on equitable&#13;
and fair terms; (e) provide advice on appropriate technology and equipment; (f) assist entrepreneurs to&#13;
select project partners and sources of equity and loan financing on appropriate terms; (g) advise private&#13;
foreign investors or financing institutions seeking to identify investment opportunities and/or local&#13;
partners in the seed subsector by bringing the parties together and helping to negotiate fair and&#13;
equitable conditions of cooperation.&#13;
14.    One business development specialist would be made available through NSIA for the project&#13;
duration. In addition, a seed processing specialist in NSIA will be available on a part-time basis to&#13;
advise on appropriate processing equipment. The human resource development specialist in NSIA&#13;
would develop tailor-made training programs for interested private sector entrepreneurs in coordination&#13;
with the business development specialist.&#13;

SEED SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR STUDY ON THE SEED RESERVE STOCK SCHEME&#13;
1.    Introduction. The project is designed to assure greater use of improved seed by farmers&#13;
to help increasing the country's food production and reduce the dependence on food imports&#13;
which are rising rapidly. An important characteristic of the food production scenario in Ethiopia&#13;
is the chronic occurrence of droughts which jeopardize food security and aggravate poverty.&#13;
Given the wide agro-ecological diversity in the country, and the cultivation of several "land races"&#13;
well adapted to specific agro-ecological niches, the problems of ensuring seed security to&#13;
underpin a food security system are very complex. It is, therefore, important to launch a special&#13;
study to find locally relevant solutions to tackle the problems of seed supply for late sown crops,&#13;
particularly in endemic drought areas.&#13;
2.    Organization of the Study. The study will be made by a team of three specialists, viz.,&#13;
team leader, seed technologist, and an agricultural economist. The team will work under the&#13;
supervision and the control of the general manager, NSIA, and will work in close coordination&#13;
with the Plant Genetics Resource Center of Ethiopia (PGRC), the Food Security Reserve&#13;
Administration, IAR, AUA, ESE, and MOA at the central and regional levels. The study will&#13;
draw upon the work already done by the ministries and institutions and FAO. A draft report will&#13;
be presented to NSIA/NSIC in six weeks from the start of the assignment, after having received&#13;
comments, the report will be finalized in another two weeks.&#13;
3.    Terms of Reference&#13;
(a)   identify the coups and the varieties (long, medium and short duration) which can&#13;
be planted over wide areas, and should be used for late sowing in predominantly&#13;
drought prone areas;&#13;
(b)   work out the seed quantities, by crop varieties and geographical locations, for&#13;
which a variety is relevant,&#13;
(c)   recommend arrangements and locations for seed production, procurement,&#13;
transportation and storage by types and quantities;&#13;
(d)   recommend arrangements for stock rotation and replenishment of each variety at&#13;
each storage location, to maintain freshness, germination, vigor and other&#13;
attributes of good seeds,&#13;
(e)   define the physical and infrastructural needs and estimate their costs; also define&#13;
how the costs will be shared by the different financing agencies;&#13;
&#13;

SEED SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.      This Prioject Implemenitation Plan (PIP) is the product ot' joint efforts of the National Seed Industry Agencv (NSIA)&#13;
and IDA ofticials responsible for the Seed Systems Development Project (SSDP).&#13;
B. Overall Responsibility&#13;
2.      NSIA: The overall responsibility for Project implementation would rest with the National Seed Industry Agency&#13;
(NSIA). created under proclamation No. 56/1993 dated July 16, 1993 as TGE's major instrument for the development of the&#13;
seed sector. NSIA would be IDA's counterpart agency for ensuring implementation of SSDP in all its aspects. NSLA's&#13;
perimanient responsibilities include: a) providing a secretariat to NSIC; b) ensuring efticient implementation of the National&#13;
Seed Policy by setting up adequate monitoring and coordinating mechanisms: c) taking the necessary steps to encourage the&#13;
growth and development of the seed sector; d) building institutional and human resource capacity in the seed sector: e)&#13;
organizing donor coordination: and finally. through these actions f) contributing significantly to increasing agricultural&#13;
productivity and building indigenous capability in the production ot improved seeds. NSIA is headed by a General Manager&#13;
(GM) and has a contingent of professional staff.&#13;
3.      NSLA is working under a policy advisory body, called the National Seed Industry Council (NSIC). NSIC is headed&#13;
by the Minister, Ministry of Natural Resource Development and Environment Protection (MONRDEP), and draws its&#13;
membership from the concerned ministries including agriculture, industry, trade and education, agencies and institutions,&#13;
including Ethiopian Standards Authority, the Science and Technology Commission, National Bank of Ethiopia, IAR, AUA,&#13;
and others to be elected by the Council. NSIC reports to the Council of Ministers and NSIC's main responsibilities include:&#13;
a) ensuring implementation of the National Seed Policy: b) issuing guidelines for efficient and competitive seed industry&#13;
development; c) promoting the domestic seed industry: d) capacity building in the seed sector:  e) reviewing the&#13;
implementation of seed related policies and recommending changes to the Council of Ministers when necessary; and finally f)&#13;
guiding and directing the NSiA. In addition. NSIC would be given the responsibility to review progress of implementation of&#13;
SSDP every quarter and provide directions and guidance to NSIA. It has been agreed that NSIC would closely monitor and&#13;
guide the implementation of SSDP.&#13;
4.      A Project Coordination and Monitoring Unit (PCMU) would be set up within NSIA for the duration of the Project&#13;
and the PCMU would coordinate the activities for the SSDP and would ensure compliance with IDA and NSIC reporting,&#13;
procurement and disbursement requirements. The PCMU would be headed by a full-time professional (Project Coordinator.&#13;
equivalent in rank to that of a Deputy General Manager) who would be accountable to the General Manager, NSIA, and&#13;
would have full responsibility for the coordination of SSDP activities. In addition, the PCMU would be staffed with: a) one&#13;
Project Accountant -cum- Disbursement Officer (PACDO);  b) two Operations Officers (OPO);  c) one Management&#13;
Information Systems and Reporting Officer (MISRO); and e) one specialist each in Secondary Seed Multiplication Systems,&#13;
in procurement, in training, and in business development. The major responsibility of the PACDO would be to ensure that all&#13;
agencies utilizing Project funds set up proper accounting systems and maintain proper accounts, and promptly claim&#13;
reimbursements from IDA. All withdrawal applications would be submitted to IDA through the office of PACDO so that a&#13;
proper track of expenditures on different components in different institutions and ministries or departments is kept and IDA&#13;
disbursements are received by the beneficiaries without undue delay. PACDO would also be responsible for supervising the&#13;
Project's "Special Accounts" and guiding various implementing agencies with regard to the procedures for their utilization.&#13;
The major responsibility of the two OPOs would be to closely supervise the implementation of various Project components,&#13;
identify implementation bottlenecks in the tield and/or at Headquarters, and bring these bottlenecks to the attention of the&#13;
Project Coordinator. The two OPOs, with duties allocated functionally between them, would also provide MISRO with&#13;
reports on physical and financial progress. MISRO would establish and operate an approved management information system&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

concerned witth project implementation, collate data and reports. and submit them to the Project Coordinator. The MIISRO&#13;
would collect data on key monitorable indicators and prepare quarterly and annual reports to be subniitted to IDA in agreed&#13;
formats: it would further prepare background and progress reports for the IDA supervision missions.&#13;
5.       The specialists will have the following duties assigined to them. The SSMS specialist, under the euidance of GM/PC&#13;
would be responsible for the planning and implemrntation of itformal farmer to farmer seed exchange program. Towards&#13;
this end, he will guide and coordinate the activities of the MOAINSIA. regional bureaus of agriculture, and ensure timely&#13;
formulation of the program for each region. training ot staff at various levels and organizing of supplies of seed mini-kits and&#13;
other equipment, like hand sieves and storage bitis in different woredas. The Procurement Specialist would be responsible for&#13;
guiding and monitoring of all IDA - funded procur-ement operations to ensure that the IDA  procurement guidelines are&#13;
followed. He would also identify the persons responsible for procuremenit in each implementing agency and arrange for their&#13;
training in IDA procuremenit procedures.  The Trainiiig Specialist will be responsible for implementing a wide range of&#13;
training activities to create awareness about improved seeds, increase the knowledge and skills of farmers about seed&#13;
production, selection, cleaning, drying and preservation through the adoptionl of safer storage methods, as well as training of&#13;
extension functionaries at various levels in the basics of seed technology.  He would also be responsible for organizing&#13;
specialized training courses specitic to the needs of each implementing agency, as well as the private sector.  Each&#13;
implementinig agency will designate a training cooiditiator to liaise with the Training Specialist. In addition, the Training&#13;
Specialist will process proposals for study tours, fellowships, workshops. and seminars.  The Business Development&#13;
Specialist will promote the development of a healthyv and competitive seed industry by mobilizing the private sector through&#13;
workshops, seminars, by developing model investment proposals, helping and guiding, on a selective basis, private&#13;
entrepreneurs in the preparation of technicallv sound and bankable feasibility studies.&#13;
6.       The agreed organizational set-up of the agency is shown in  Annex 7. The NSIA would ensure that all of the&#13;
PCMU professional staff, and Finance and Accounts Department Staff and a minimum of two agricultural economists, two&#13;
seed data experts, and a seed technologist/agronomist are in place in the NSIA permanent organizational set-up, before&#13;
project effectiveness.&#13;
7.       Salaries and wages of regular NSIA staff would be paid by the Government; IDA would  a) assist in the provision&#13;
of technical assistance and training for NSIA staff: b) finance salaries and allowances (like per diem) of the staff for SSDP&#13;
coordination and monitoring office (PCMU), to be recruited on personnel service contracts (this office would be wound up on&#13;
Project completion): and c) finance expenditures on vehicles and equipment required for NSIA to ensure rapid build up of its&#13;
implementation capacity. Technical assistance would be provided to make NSIA develop: a) appropriate management&#13;
systems, procedures and controls; b) a Management Information System (MIS) for the seed sector in general, and SSDP in&#13;
particular; c) expertise in seed processing, marketing; and d) informal seed development programs..&#13;

Project year (PY-1), and an Operational Plan .i :uarantee sustainability after closing date, both in a format satisfactory to&#13;
IDA; i) conducting, jointly with IDA, a Mid- I  ii Review of Project progress within six months from the close of the second&#13;
Project year (PY-2); and j) preparing an Imp,  ni(ation Completion Report (ICR) within six month from the close of the&#13;
Project. The Government has assured IDA th.x,; i ,ould provide adequate and timely budgetary and staffing support to NSIA&#13;
to undertake these responsibilities.&#13;

Page 3 of 7&#13;
9.      NSIA would set up the following institutional and regulatory mechanisms to  secure inter-agency coordination,&#13;
obtain periodic feedback, to regularly submit progress reports to IDA in agreed formats, and thereby implement the Seed&#13;
Systems Development Project:&#13;
a)       Project Implementation Committee (PIC):  NSIA would set up a Project Implementation Committee&#13;
(PIC) with membership drawn from all implementing agencies. Project Coordinator in charge of the&#13;
Project Monitoring and Coordination Unit would be nominated as the Secretary of PIC. Members would&#13;
include representatives from ESE and the private sector seed producers and marketers, as well as&#13;
representatives from  MOA's IAR, AUA  and PGRC.   PIC  would meet every month under the&#13;
chairmanship of the General Manager. NSIA. Members of PIC would be heads of concerned Departments&#13;
and senior staff of implementing agencies. The agenda for PIC meetings would include training physical&#13;
and financial progress of the various project components, and progress in procurement, construction of&#13;
works, installation of equipment, and seed production and marketing issues. Towards this end, NSIA&#13;
would. during the Project Launch Workshop, define for each of the implementing agencies the formats&#13;
and the timing for the submission of the monthly progress reports.&#13;
b)       Meetings with Regional Agricultural Bureaus: In order to maintain its grass root contacts and stay&#13;
current with the problems of each region, and to assist the newly set-up regional administrations, NSIA&#13;
would periodically hold. preferably on a quarterly basis, meetings at selected places in the country, each&#13;
in a cluster of mostly contiguous regions. These meetings would be used to review, on a regional basis,&#13;
the progress made and problems encountered in the implementation of various SSDP components and to&#13;
agree with the regional administrations on a work plan. Representatives of concerned institutions would&#13;
participate in these meetings. Arrangements would also be made to secure participation in these meetings&#13;
of the private seed trade as well as the local branches of the Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank&#13;
(AIDB), the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) and/or any other rural cooperative institution to be set&#13;
up for the purpose of providing credit to the farming population.&#13;
c)       Annual Workshop on Seed: NSIA would hold an Annual National Seed Workshop, preferably in the&#13;
month of December tc (i) comprehensively review the performance in the outgoing year and identify,&#13;
thereby, successes and failures in the implementation of each project component on a regional basis; (ii)&#13;
prepare, in consultation with and the cooperation of all participating agencies, workplans for&#13;
implementation in the following year and assign responsibilities for future specific actions to various'&#13;
implementation agencies. Once the Annual Seed Workshop has taken place, PIC would, in its regular&#13;
monthly meetings review the progress in the implementation of the recommendation for each concerned&#13;
agency, and the committee would follow up closely where the progress is slow and include the results of&#13;
such review in its quarterly progress reports to NSIC and IDA.&#13;
d)       Project Launch Workshop: NSIA would, in close collaboration with IDA, organize a Project Launch&#13;
Workshop before or immediately after Credit Effectiveness. All agencies involved in the implementation&#13;
of the Project would be required to participate in this workshop. The agenda for the workshop, to focus&#13;
on start-up issues and work programs for the first year of the project, would be finalized in consultation&#13;
with IDA. NSIA would present for discussion and finalization, during the workshop, proposals for&#13;
technical assistance and training in Project Year 1. The NSIA would also present the plan for ensuring&#13;
adequate seed production during Project Year 1. The proposed Key Project Indicators (see Annex 9,&#13;
Attachments), and the format for the quarterly progress reports, would also be discussed and finalized&#13;
during the Project Launch Workshop.&#13;
e)     Workshops on Procurement, Disbursement and Project Management: NSIA would further organize,&#13;
with IDA assistance, a workshop on procurement, disbursement and project management, in Project Year&#13;
I (and in subsequent years. if necessary) for selected staff engaged in SSDP related procurement,&#13;
disbursement and project management. The concerned staff of NSIA and the SSDP's PCMU in NSIA&#13;
would receive intensive training in IDA procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

I)      Mld-Term Review (NMR): NSIA would collaborate with IDA for a mid-term review (MTR) of SSDP,&#13;
which is planned to be held within six months from the close of Project Year 2. NSLA would enlist the&#13;
participation of all concemed implementing agencies. The MTR would include a review of the progress in&#13;
policy refom including pricing, subsidies and market liberalization; private sector development; progress&#13;
in SSMS; seed use by regions and fUture outlook; progress achieved in staffing, funding and operations of&#13;
NSIA and various committees; progress in institutional and human capacity building; and ESE's&#13;
operations including its restructuring and profitability. Based on the findings of the IDA's MTR mission,&#13;
the Project would be restructured, if and as necessary.&#13;
g)      Project Reporting, Monitoring and Evaluation:  NSIA would be responsible for coordinating the&#13;
development of annual work plans for various Project componenu and maintaining data on&#13;
implementation progress. Towards this end the NSIA would.&#13;
(I) establish bench marks for evaluation of subsequerit project achievements in consultation with&#13;
implementing agencies;&#13;
(ii) prepare quarterly progress reports, providing 'a descriptive and analytical account of project&#13;
achievements and highlighting implementation problems; these reports would be regularly submitted to&#13;
NSIC and IDA for the quarters ending March, June, September and December. The comments and&#13;
directives of NSIC, if any, on the quarterly reports would also be subsequently comnunicated to IDA.&#13;
(iii) ensure that the business plan of ESE is submitted to IDA three months prior to the beginning of each&#13;
fiscal year (or any other time span used for planning purposes by the enterprise); IA's comments would&#13;
be taken into consideration before finalizing the business plan.&#13;
(iv) prepire and submit to IDA an Implementation Compledon Report (ICR) within six months from&#13;
project closing date. The ICR would, inter alia, include the Government's assessment of the extent to&#13;
which objectives were realized, details of physical and financial achievements, problems encountered,&#13;
solutions found and lessons learned. IDA would provide NSIA with a standard format for the ICR.&#13;
h)      Audit:  NSIA would ensure that separate books of account are maintained in NSIA and by each&#13;
implementing agency for all project related accounts. These accounts, together with special accounts and&#13;
statements of expenditure, would be audited on an annual basis, by external auditors satisfactory to IMA;&#13;
audit reports would be submitted to IDA within six months from the end of the fiscal year.&#13;
j)      Quality Control Lagielatton and Its Enforcement: NSIA would take the necessary initiatives to get a&#13;
seed law promulgated; the Seed Quality Control and Seed Certification Service to be set-up in NSIA would&#13;
be responsible for enforcing the new quality control legislation.  NSIA would notify DA of the&#13;
enforcement arrangements by September 1996.&#13;
k)      Regulatory Seovce: Given the critical role of the National Variety Release Committee (NVRC) and the&#13;
Plant Quarandne Service (PQS) in ensuring production of seed of a satisfactory quality, the performance&#13;
of these two Instutions would also be subject to review by IDA supervision missions. Both of these&#13;
institutions would be required to furnish quarterly progress reports to NSrA, in a formts to be agreed&#13;
during Proct LAunch Workshop; these reports would, on request, be available to IDA. At Mid-Term&#13;
Review, the performance and huture investment needs of these two agencies would also be reviewed.&#13;
D. Secondary Seed MultIpdlcadon Scheme&#13;
10.     The Secondary Seed Multiplication Scheme (SSMS) is a pilot inidtive and the following are the preconditions for&#13;
its success: a) SSMS must be a well planned and well executed intervendon; b) extension staff responsible for SSMS&#13;
implementatdon must be well trained and well motivated for this task; c) arrangements for supervision and monitoring of the&#13;
entire SSMS efftrt must be well thought-out and executed in a meticulous way; d) it must be ensured that there are no&#13;
delays in the supply of improved  leds and equipment to the selected farmers under the SSMS, and to this extent there&#13;
needs to be very careful and timely assessment of requiremenu and organization of supplies to each micro-location; and e)&#13;
suitable and adequate mobility must be provided to those engaged in implementing and supervising SSMS at all levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

extent there needs to be very careful and timely assessment of requirements and organization of supplies to each micro-&#13;
location; and e) suitable and adequate mobility must be provided to those engaged in implementing and supervising SSMS at&#13;
all levels.&#13;
11.      Focal Points for Implementation of SSMS would be as follows:  a) at the National Level, the NSIA would be&#13;
responsible for the overall direction, planning, assessments of requirements and organization of supplies, monitoring and&#13;
preparation of periodical reports and this would be accomplished by NSIA in close cooperation with MOA, IAR, AUA, ESE,&#13;
the private sector seed suppliers (if any) and Plant Genetics Resource Center;  b) at the Regional Level, the  Regional&#13;
Agricultural Bureau (RAB), particularly the selected staff handling SSMS, assisted by local research stations and nearest&#13;
regional office of ESE; c) at the Zonal Level, the Zonal Agricultural Office (selected staff); d) at the Woreda Level the&#13;
selected Extension Staff; and e) at the Peasant Association (PA) Level, the Selected Farmers/groups of farmers and&#13;
Development Agents (DAs).&#13;
12.      Main Activities under the SSMS are: a) the training of selected farmers in seed selection, production, harvesting,&#13;
clearning, and storage (see attachment 3); b) provision of improved or local seeds for each selected farmer; seed of the&#13;
relevant crop and variety; c) provision of other needed supplies, like hand sieves, maize shellers, small seed storage bins,&#13;
for the farmers; and d) provision of some other standard equipment for SSMS extension agents, like moisture meters.&#13;
13.      The tentative seed production targets under SSMS are shown in the table below:&#13;
| __________________________     _ |  PYI   |   PY2        PY3        PY4        PY-5       Total&#13;

Note : Values in the above table are targets, to be adjusted annually during the&#13;
national Seed Workshop on the basis of actual results&#13;
E. Breeder Seed Production&#13;
14.      Three months prior to the beginning of each year, IAR, AUA and PGRC would prepare a detailed review of the&#13;
physical and financial progress likely to be achieved in the current year, and the next years' plans for procurement of civil&#13;
works, equipment, vehicles and any other items, both in physical and financial terms. These proposals would be reviewed by&#13;
NSIA, (PIC) and suitable provisions made for funds and procurement. The format of such a report would be agreed by NSIA&#13;
with IDA during Project Launch Workshop. (All IDA supervision missions would be provided with progress reports,&#13;
transport facilities and access to facilities funded by the Project). The progress reports would, inter alia, summarize the&#13;
improvements registered in the quantity and quality of breeder seed production.&#13;
F. Ethiopian Seed Enterprise&#13;
15.      The Ethiopian seed Enterprise (ESE) would, under the Project, be required to:  a) complete its restructuring in&#13;
accordance with its Restructuring Plan; b) ensure that appropriate operational and financial procedures for each farm and&#13;
regional unit are well-documented; c) annuallk prepare a Business Plan for the following year; d) rehabilitate all the seed&#13;
processing plants; e) develop a new marketing '.rategy for servicing the peasant sector through a network of wholesale and&#13;
retail outlets, thereby relying to the extent po%iNble on the private sector for seed distribution and sales; f) develop a seed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6:3 -                                                 Annex 9&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
production manual for contract seed production with smallholders as well as commercial seed producers; and g) install an&#13;
appropriate and comprehensive Management Information System (MIS).&#13;
16.     The NSIA and ESE would agree on target dates for the completion of each of the above mentioned tasks. NS1A&#13;
would inform IDA during the Project Launch Workshop on the agreements which it has reached with ESE. Further, NSIA&#13;
and ESE would develop a format for quarterly review of progress in the completion of these tasks, this format would be&#13;
reviewed by IDA during the Project Launch Workshop. Thereafter, NSIA would incorporate in its quarterly progress report&#13;
to be submitted to IDA the ESE's progress report in the agreed format. NSIA would arrange that ESE's annual business plan&#13;
is submitted to IDA 90 days before the start of the new fiscal year (or any other date used by ESE for planning purposes).&#13;
NSIA would further ensure that a copy of the ESE's progress report is submitted to NSIC every quarter.&#13;
G. The Private Sector&#13;
18.     The private sector would be represented on NSIA's Project Implementation Committee (PIC) and other relevant&#13;
committees. With regard to representation in the NSIC, the private sector will be invited to attend quarterly meetings where&#13;
implementation progress of SSDP will be reviewed. The private sector would be treated at par with the public and&#13;
cooperative sector in the matter of subsidy payments, if any, and domestic marketing. Further, the private sector would be&#13;
invited to participate in all seed related workshops, seminars, training programs and study tours, and would benefit from&#13;
technical assistance to prepare bankable reports for seed related activities.&#13;
H. The Central Government and Regional Administrations&#13;
19.     The role of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) would be central in the successful implementation of the SSMS.&#13;
This responsibility would be discharged by MOA in close cooperation with and guidance to the relevant wings of the newly&#13;
set up regional administrations and in close collaboration with NSIA. MOA's responsibilities would include, supporting rapid&#13;
rural appraisal, as needed, in selected regions to define objectives and formulate programs; forging of links between seed&#13;
research, extension and the farmer; seed use promotion through the national, regional and grassroots extension systems; and&#13;
installing a monitoring and coordinating mechanism within the MOA to ensure a balanced and well coordinated thrust towards&#13;
the realization of the objectives of the Project.  Towards this end, MOA would make a quarterly review of SSMS&#13;
implementation progress with the concerned MOA heads of departments and divisions including extension, cooperatives,&#13;
planning, and agricultural development, and would submit its report to NSIA. In addition, annually (date to be fixed at the&#13;
Project Launch Workshop), MOA would organize detailed consultations with the regional agricultural bureaus and, drawing&#13;
on the lessons of the completed season, develop a work program for the coming year. Such consultations and decisions&#13;
would constitute a valuable and practical input into the National Seed Workshop to be annually organized by NSIA.&#13;
20.     The newly created Regional Administrations would play an increasingly critical role in SSDP implementation. In&#13;
particular, they would be responsible for implementing SSMS on the ground, and creating a general awareness as to the&#13;
benefits of the use of improved seed. Towards this end, the regional administrations would assign high priority to seed&#13;
development programs, and arrange for systematic training of selected extension functionaries at various levels. NSIA and&#13;
MOA would ensure that adequate facilities in terms of equipment and staff training are provided to regional agricultural&#13;
bureaus, to coordinate, guide and monitor the implementation of SSDP in the region. NSIA would also ensure that the&#13;
regional bureaus participate actively in the Project Launch Workshop, and set up input units within the Regional Agricultural&#13;
Bureaus. These units would monitor the seed development initiatives in the region, by developing an appropriate reporting&#13;
and management information system.&#13;
I. Capacity Building&#13;
21.     The NSIA would coordinate and implement the capacity building programs under the proposed Project and would as&#13;
such bear the overall responsibility for the Training. Each implementing department and/or agency, would prepare its&#13;
training requirements and submit these requirements to NSIA. NSIA would prepare a similar list for its own staff, and would&#13;
draw up the proposal for the training program. Much of the training would be on-the-job training; the training program&#13;
would identify the subjects and courses for training, their timing, duration, estimated costs, name of the training institution&#13;
and its location and names of persons proposed and justification for this training. The training program would include&#13;
overseas fellowships (the Project would sponsor one Ph.D and one M.Sc) and study tours, on-site training to the national,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
-  64  -                                             Page 7 of 7&#13;
regional and field staff, selected farmers and seed traders (both in the public and the private sectors).  The Project&#13;
Implementation Committee (PlC) would review  these training proposals and approve the annual program.  IDA's "no&#13;
objection" would be required for all courses and staff selected for overseas training, as well as foreign study tours financed&#13;
under the Project.&#13;
22.     Training courses would be organized each year by NSIA for all seed distributors, wholesalers and retailers, in order&#13;
to promote an efficient and competitive seed marketing system and more efficient use of seed. The IDA would be informed of&#13;
the details of the training programs in advance. While training of seed dealers would be free of charge in the first two Project&#13;
years; the possibility of requiring the sponsors, to cover part or all of the training costs for dealers, would be evaluated at&#13;
Mid-Term Review. NSIA would finalize institutional arrangements for dealers training in 1995; details on location of training&#13;
wxould be submitted at Project Launch Workshop.&#13;
23.      The Project would essentially be managed by Ethiopians with limited short-term expatriate Technical Assistance.&#13;
The technical assistance would mainly be used for: a) rehabilitation of existing seed processing facilities; b) development of&#13;
a new marketing strategy; and c) development of the MIS for the seed sector. The current assessment of TA needs is&#13;
reflected in Annex 8. NSIA would ensure, for all local and internationally recruited Technical Assistance that: a) Terms of&#13;
Reference, qualification and experience as well as terms of employment are satisfactory to IDA; b) all proposals are&#13;
processed through Project Implementation Committee; and c) adequately qualified counterparts, for the duration of the&#13;
particular assignment are assigned to the hired technical assistants.  Further, based on a skill-gap analysis of the&#13;
counterpart. a training program would be prepared and implemented to allow local staff to assume the duties and&#13;
responsibilities of the technical assistance program within a specified time span.&#13;
J. Activities Arising from the Project Implementation Plan, Key Monitorable Indicators and Supervision Plan&#13;
24.      Finally, the schedule of activities arising out of the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) is indicated in Annex 9,&#13;
Attachment 1; a draft of Key Monitorable Indicators, to be finalized during the Project Launch Workshop, is also shown as&#13;
Attachment 2 in this Annex. The agreed Supervision Plan is shown in Annex 10.&#13;

ETHIOP IA&#13;
SEED SYSTEMIS DEVELOPNIENT PROJECT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.     The proposed Seed Systems Development Project (SSDP) has been rated Category B for environmental&#13;
assessment, as the environmental issues to be addressed are limuted and narrow in scope. The main issue relates to&#13;
pest management and the use of pesticides in seed production and processing. In addition, it is desirable to&#13;
examine the potential impact of the project on the genetic diversity of crop species in Ethiopia.&#13;
Pest Management and Pesticides&#13;
2      Pesticide use in the seed sector includes seed dressing (applied either at a conditioning plant or at the user&#13;
level) to control seed-borne or soil-borne pests and diseases, treatment of fumigation of stored seeds to control post-&#13;
harvest pests and diseases, and field application of pesticides to protect growing plants (breeder seed production&#13;
and bulking up). The proposed project would provide support for seed production, processing and storage, both&#13;
directlv for ESE operations and through assistance for the development of private sector initiatives through NSIA.&#13;
It is beyond the scope of this project to attempt to establish a broad-based integrated pest management (1PM)&#13;
program for production of food crops in Ethiopia. However, IDA policies require that the project promote rational&#13;
pest management methods within the activities supported by the project, and that it include specific measures to&#13;
minimize human and environmental hazards by supporting appropriate selection. use and handling of pesticides.&#13;
3.     A national pesticide legislation enacted recently uill soon introduce a pesticide registration scheme which&#13;
will set standards for pesticide importation, production and use in Ethiopia, based on effectiveness, health and&#13;
environmental impacts. Until this scheme is put into effect, however, steps must be taken to ensure appropnate&#13;
pesticide selection and use consistent with the Government's policies and objectives as well as IDA policies and&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
4.     Technical issues and institutional responsibilities relating to pesticides and pest management differ&#13;
between the existing state farm and peasant sectors. It can be anticipated that some simnilar distinctions will&#13;
continue to be appropriate in the future between the peasant sector and any large-scale, commercially-oriented&#13;
operations which may supplement or replace the state farms. For purposes of the proposed project, this generally&#13;
parallels the distinction between components to strengthen the public sector and "forrnal" private sector capacity&#13;
for production, processing and marketing of seeds, versus the informal (peasant) sector "secondary seed&#13;
multiplication scheme,'(SSMS). The relevant issues for each sector are discussed below.&#13;
Fertilizer Users&#13;
5.     The State Farm and the Formal Commercial Sector: The ESE currently provides seeds directly to state&#13;
farms, pre-treating them with insecticides and fungicides at its seed conditioning plants. The MSFCTD's&#13;
Agricultural Research and Advisory Department (ARAD) is responsible for recommending which products are&#13;
used, based on its own criteria (e.g. product must be registered in at least two countries) and field testing for&#13;
effectiveness. Currently recommended are various commercial mnixtures of non-systemic fungicides (e.g. Thiram)&#13;
and insecticides (e.g. Lindan, Furadan).  These products are acceptable under IDA guidelines and their&#13;
procurement can therefore be supported under the project. However, the products shown in the negative list of&#13;
pesticides (see below) would not be considered for financing under the project.&#13;
6.     The ESE is also conscious of %%orker health and safety in handling seed treatment chemical in its seed&#13;
processing plants, using an automated method involving slurries in order to reduce exposure and dust&#13;
contamination. Handling will be further improved under the project as rehabilitation of the seed processing plants&#13;
will include better isolation/compartmentalization of the seed treatment equipment.&#13;
&#13;

7.      For stored product pest control. MSFCTD/ARAD recommends Aluminum Phosphide as a fumigant and&#13;
pyrimiphos methyl (Actellic) and Malathion to spray surfaces of storage facilities. These products are acceptable&#13;
under [DA guidelines.&#13;
8.      MSFCTD indicated that pesticide use in the field for food crops is largely limited to herbicides, as xkecds&#13;
are the major production constraint. Pesticide treatment is only very rarely required for control of animal pests or&#13;
diseases of these crops.  A  list of the herbicides, fungicides and insecticides currently recommended by&#13;
MSFCTD/ARAD for maize, sorghum, wvheat. barlev, teff. pulses, various beans. sesame, rape seed. sunflower.&#13;
fruits and vegetables; is available in the project files. The list also indicates those products not to be procured with&#13;
assistance from IDA.&#13;
9.      Because the project will promote the entry of new participants in the seed processing and marketing&#13;
business. it will be necessary to ensure proper selection and handling of seed treatment chemicals beyond direct&#13;
ESE and state farms operations. The NSIC should include this aspect in the proposed Seed Act. At the same time,&#13;
NSIA will be responsible for including seed treatment aspect in its advice and assistance to individuals and&#13;
cnterprises entering the business, ensuring that these processes are in accordance with government regulations and&#13;
with IDA guidelines.&#13;
10.    The Peasant Sector: The Agricultural Inputs Supply Enterprise (AISCO) is responsible for distributing&#13;
fertilizers and pesticides to peasant farmers. The majority of pesticides provided through AISCO are currently&#13;
procured under an IDA-financed project, and therefore subject to IDA approval. However, some pesticides not&#13;
eligible for IDA financing are purchased using resources from other donors.&#13;
11.     ESE does not pre-treat seeds it supplies for the peasant sector, due to the risk that excess treated seeds may&#13;
be sold or used for food or animal feed. ESE and MOA recommendation, which IDA endorses, is that treated seed&#13;
should not be provided to the peasant sector as a whole until the agricultural extension system is strong enough to&#13;
provide the necessary education and technical support.&#13;
12.     AISCO does, however, provide seed dressing chemicals to some peasant farmers so that they can treat&#13;
their own seed or, in some cases, have their seed treated for them by local agricultural extension agents at the&#13;
distribution centers.  In general, seed treatment is an acceptable crop protection method, preferable to the&#13;
alternative of greater use of pesticide spraying. However, it is recognized that the agricultural extension service is&#13;
not yet sufficiently strong to provide sufficient training and technical support to peasant farmers to ensure that seed&#13;
dressings are handled safely and effectively. The MOA is beginning to address this by developing appropriate&#13;
training and extension materials with the assistance of an FAO consultant. Nevertheless, great caution must&#13;
continue to be exercised regarding the level of toxicity of seed treatment chemicals (as with any pesticides) to be&#13;
handled and used by poorly educated small-scale farmers.&#13;
13.    It is therefore of great concern that the seed dressings currently provided to peasant farmers in some areas&#13;
where termites are deemed to be a problem contain materials such as Aldrin and Chlordane/Heptachlor, which are&#13;
highly toxic and therefore banned or severely restricted in a large number of countries.&#13;
14.    As the new committee responsible for establishing pesticide regulations and registration carries out its&#13;
task of deternining which products will be permitted for use in Ethiopia in the future, it is to be hoped that use of&#13;
these products will discontinued entirely. Together with the IAR it should also examine the cost-effectiveness of&#13;
using insecticidal seed treatments against termites and other soil-borne pests. In the meantime, it must be noted&#13;
that these products are not eligible for financing by IDA and should not be recommended or used in any activity&#13;
supported or promoted under the project.&#13;
15.    Under the Secondary Seed Multiplication Scheme, MOA staff will be responsible to identify appropriate&#13;
pest management methods, both chemical and non-chemical (including seed processing, seed production and seed&#13;
storage), and to assist and train the participants to use them.&#13;

Maintaining Genetic Diversity&#13;
16.    Ethiopia is the center of origin for a number of food crops of regional and world-wide importance.&#13;
Farmers all over the countrv continue to grow and select primitive cultivars of indigenous crop species&#13;
("landraces") as well as those of some important introduced crop species. The genetic diversity of some crops such&#13;
as wsheat, sorghum, millet and teff grown by farmers throughout Ethiopia may be as great or greater than is found&#13;
anvwhere else in the world. The biological diversity embodied in these landraces and primitive cultivars represents&#13;
a priceless genetic store of characteristics such as drought tolerance, insect and disease resistance, specific&#13;
agronomic and nutritional traits. etc. * hich are equally (and in some cases more) important as straight -ield,&#13;
particularly for subsistence-level farmers. While the introduction and development of higher-yielding varieties is&#13;
clearly necessarv to achieve agricultural growth, there is a risk that these modem varieties will displace and&#13;
eliminate the indigenous genetic resource base unless specific measures are taken to ensure that it is incorporated&#13;
effectively into breeding programs and is maintained and continues to evolve as a source of genetic raw material&#13;
for the future.&#13;
17.    This objective is being addressed in part by an On-farm Conservation" project which is supported by a&#13;
consortium of Canadian NGOs, headed by the Unitarian Service Committee of Canada (now USC/C). T'he On-&#13;
farm Conservation program, implemented in collaboration with the Ethiopian Plant Genetic Resources Centre&#13;
(PGRCIE), encourages peasant farmers in selected (particularly drought-affected) areas to continue growing local&#13;
landraces of several staple crops which are in danger of being displaced by more modem varieties. The breeder&#13;
seed is obtained from PGRC/E, from IAR breeders and from farmers themselves. The project assists and&#13;
supervises production of seeds of selected landraces and primitive varieties, buys excess seed from the farmers at an&#13;
attractive price, and distributes it to other farmers to grow in the next season.&#13;
18.    The On-farm Conservation project in Ethiopia is one component of a broader "Seeds of Survival" (SOS)&#13;
program which aims to promote development of a sustainable, long-term, secure and abundant food supply in&#13;
Africa through the preservation, enhancement and distribution of the genetic diversity of food crops. Other&#13;
elements of the SOS include training (international in scope, held twice yearly in Ethiopia), technical assistance,&#13;
information networks and education relating to the importance of maintaining genetic diversity and farrmer-level&#13;
plant breeding.&#13;
19.    Projects such as these are important to complement and provide a counter-balance to efforts to introduce&#13;
and develop a limited number of high-yielding, modem varieties which are likely to require high levels of external&#13;
inputs (fertilizers, irrigation, pest management) to be profitable, and therefore will not be appropriate for may&#13;
small farmers. MOA responsible for the implementation of the SSMS, and the breeding programs of the IAR and&#13;
AUA under this IDA-Financed project would coordinate with the PGRC/E and the On-farm Conservation project&#13;
to benefit form the expertise and groundwork already established and to ensure that their efforts are complementary&#13;
and mutually reinforcing. Accordingly, SSDP is providing funds to strengthen the institutional capacity of&#13;
PGRC/E.&#13;
Negative List of Pesticides&#13;
20.    IDA would make available to NSIA the negative list of pesticides, as updated from time to time, to help&#13;
the concerned institutions ensure that the hazardous products are neither funded under IDA financed project, nor&#13;
otherwise encouraged for importation into the country.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Seed Systems Development Project
            will contribute to the national goal of increased
            agricultural production and productivity by laying the
            foundation for the development of a broad-based and
            competitive seed industry which draws its strength both from
            the formal and the informal seed system. The project
            supports Seed Policy Reform, through each of its two
            components. The components are : (a) Seed Enterprise
            Development; and (b) Capacity Building. The first component
            supports (i) the development of the informal seed sector;
            (ii) encourages private sector entry into the formal
            business; and supports (iii) the restructuring of the
            Ethiopian Seed Enterprise from a centrally managed
            parastatal to a decentralized and commercially oriented
            enterprise. The second component involves: (i) institutional
            strengthening; and (ii) human resource development, both in
            the formal and the informal sector.
