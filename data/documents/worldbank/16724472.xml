&amp;#12;Glossary of Terms&#13;
                       Benefit-cost ratio (BCR): The amount by which an interventionâ&#128;&#153;s benefits exceed the same interventionâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                       costs. Technically: the ratio of the present value of the stream of benefits to the present value of the stream&#13;
                       of costs. The higher the ratio, the more efficient the intervention.&#13;
&#13;
                       Cost per case averted: The discounted value of the costs for each case of a disease that is avoided&#13;
                       resulting from an intervention.&#13;
&#13;
                       Cost per DALY averted: The discounted value of the costs for each DALY that is avoided resulting from&#13;
                       an intervention.&#13;
&#13;
                       Cost per death averted: The discounted value of the costs for each death that is avoided resulting from&#13;
                       an intervention.&#13;
&#13;
                       Cost-effectiveness ratio (CER): The ratio of the present value of the future costs to the present value of&#13;
                       the future health benefits in non-monetary units (cases, deaths, disability-adjusted life-years). The lower&#13;
                       the CER the more efficient the intervention.&#13;
&#13;
                       Diarrhea: The passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day, or more frequently than is normal&#13;
                       for the individual. It is usually a symptom of gastrointestinal infection, which can be caused by a variety of&#13;
                       bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms. Infection is spread through contaminated food or drinking-water,&#13;
                       or from person to person as a result of poor hygiene.&#13;
&#13;
                       Disability-Adjusted Life-Year (DALY): a measurement of the gap between current health status and an&#13;
                       ideal health situation where the entire population lives to an advanced age, free of disease and disability.&#13;
                       One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of â&#128;&#156;healthyâ&#128;? life (WHO 2010).&#13;
&#13;
                       Ecological sanitation (EcoSan)1: a new paradigm in sanitation that recognizes human excreta and water&#13;
                       from households not as waste but as resources that can be recovered, treated where necessary and safely&#13;
                       used again. It is based on the systematic implementation of reuse and recycling of nutrients and water as&#13;
                       a hygienically safe, closed-loop and holistic alternative to conventional sanitation solutions (GTZ, 2009).&#13;
                       The objectives are to offer economically and ecologically sustainable systems that aim to close the natural&#13;
                       nutrient and water cycle. The approach is based on the systematic implementation of reuse and recycling&#13;
                       of nutrients and water as a hygienically safe, closed-loop and holistic alternative that seeks to protect public&#13;
                       health, prevent pollution and at the same time return valuable nutrients and humus to the soil.&#13;
&#13;
                       Externality: an externality is a consequence of an activity that is experienced by unrelated third parties.&#13;
                       An externality can be either positive or negative. In the case of a sanitation intervention in a community&#13;
                       practicing open defecation, a positive externality can result, whereby benefits extend beyond the&#13;
                       households practicing improved sanitation, such as preventing surface and ground water pollution,&#13;
                       reducing bad odors and improving outward (visual) appearances. An important positive externality in the&#13;
                       case of sanitation is the reduced levels of disease, thus impacting labor force productivity.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                       Helminthes: Parasitic worms that live and feed off living hosts, receiving nourishment and protection&#13;
                       while disrupting their hostsâ&#128;&#153; nutrient absorption, causing weakness and disease.&#13;
&#13;
                       Hepatitis A: Acute infectious disease of the liver caused by the hepatitis A virus, which is commonly&#13;
                       transmitted by the fecal-oral route via contaminated food or drinking water.&#13;
&#13;
                       Hepatitis E: A viral hepatitis (liver inflammation) caused by infection with a virus called hepatitis E virus&#13;
                       (HEV). HEV is transmitted via the fecal-oral route.&#13;
&#13;
                       Improved sanitation: The use of the following facilities in the home compound: flush/pour-flush to&#13;
                       piped sewer system/septic tank/pit latrine, ventilated improved pit (VIP) latrine, pit latrine with slab, or&#13;
                       composting toilet (JMP, 2008).&#13;
&#13;
                       Income elasticity of demand: Measures the responsiveness of the demand for a good to a change in the&#13;
                       income of the people demanding the good. It is calculated as the ratio of the percentage change in demand&#13;
                       to the percentage change in income. For example, if, in response to a 10% increase in income, the demand&#13;
                       for a good increased by 20%, the income elasticity of demand would be 20%/10% = 2.&#13;
&#13;
                       Intangible impact: An identifiable non-monetary consequence of an intervention that cannot be&#13;
                       easily seen, touched or physically measured. It is a gain or loss that cannot be sufficiently quantified for&#13;
                       purposes of accounting or financial reporting, but that contributes to changes in quality of life and project&#13;
                       performance such as employee morale, work or life satisfaction, or quality of environment. Intangible&#13;
                       benefits of improved sanitation include, for example, quality of life, comfort, security, dignity, personal and&#13;
                       cultural preferences, among others.&#13;
&#13;
                       Internal rate of return: A measure used to compare the profitability of alternative uses of investment funds&#13;
                       (or â&#128;&#152;projectsâ&#128;&#153;). It is the interest (or â&#128;&#152;discountâ&#128;&#153;) rate at which the net present value (NPV) of costs (negative&#13;
                       cash flows) of the investment equals the net present value of the benefits (positive cash flows) of the&#13;
                       investment. In other words, the interest rate for which the BCR equals unity (1).&#13;

                       Lifecycle costs: A costing analysis that takes into account not only the investment costs, but also&#13;
                       operations and maintenance â&#128;&#147; hence giving a fuller picture of the commitment in future expenditures&#13;
                       needed to keep a sanitation system running over its expected lifespan.&#13;
&#13;
                       Malaria: A mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by a eukaryotic protest of the genus Plasmodium.&#13;
&#13;
                       Malnutrition: The insufficient, excessive or imbalance of nutrient consumption.&#13;
&#13;
                       Net benefit: The monetary difference between present value of the future stream of benefits to the present&#13;
                       value of the future stream of costs.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     Net present value (NPV): The discounted value of the current and future stream of net benefits from&#13;
                     a project. The NPV, a time series of cash flows, both incoming and outgoing, is the sum of the present&#13;
                     values of the individual cash flows. In the case when all future cash flows are incoming (such as coupons&#13;
                     and principal of a bond) and the only outflow of cash is the purchase price, the NPV is simply the present&#13;
                     value of future cash flows minus the purchase price.&#13;
&#13;
                     Open defecation: The practice of disposing human feces in fields, forests, bushes, open bodies of water,&#13;
                     beaches or other open spaces or disposed of with solid waste (JMP, 2008).&#13;
&#13;
                     Payback period (PBP): Represents the number of periods (e.g. years) that are necessary to recover the&#13;
                     costs incurred until that time point (i.e. investment plus recurrent costs). For example, a $1000 investment&#13;
                     which returned $500 per year would have a two-year payback period. Payback period intuitively measures&#13;
                     how long something takes to â&#128;&#156;pay for itself.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
                     Septic tank: Rectangular chamber, usually sited just below ground level, that receives and partially treats&#13;
                     brown water from flush toilets, and can include other household wastewater.&#13;
&#13;
                     Unimproved sanitation: The use of the following facilities: flush/pour flush without isolation or&#13;
                     treatment, pit latrine without slab/open pit, bucket, hanging toilet/hanging latrine, use of a public facility&#13;
                     or sharing any improved facility, no facilities, bush or field (open defecation) (JMP, 2008).&#13;

       The study was led by the East Asia and Pacific (EAP) office of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation&#13;
       Program (WSP), with the contribution of WSP teams and consultants in each of the participating&#13;
       countries. The study took three years to complete, and has undergone several major peer review processes.&#13;
&#13;
       Guy Hutton (WSP Senior Water and Sanitation Economist and Task Team Leader) led the development&#13;
       of the concept and methodology for the ESI, the management and coordination of the country teams,&#13;
       the provision of regional tools and templates, and the report writing. Bjorn Larsen (WSP consultant)&#13;
       contributed to the development of generic data collection tools and the health methodology. Martin&#13;
       Albrecht (WSP) supported the research management and writing process. The study benefited from the&#13;
       continuous support of other WSP staff: Almud Weitz, Isabel Blackett, Yosa Yuliarsa, Irvan Tjondronegoro&#13;
       and support staff.&#13;
&#13;
       The Indonesia research team, based at PT Mitra Lingkungan Dutaconsult (MLD) Indonesia, consisted of:&#13;
       Asep Winara (Team Leader), Oktarinda (Field Manager), Edi Purnomo (Statistician and Data Manager),&#13;
       Koderi Hadiwardoyo (Health Expert), Indon Merdykasari (Sanitation Engineer), Takdir Nurmadi (Senior&#13;
       Sociologist), Bert Bruinsma (Economics Advisor) and Dedek Gunawan (WSP consultant). The Team&#13;
       was supervised by Dadang Fadilah. Water quality monitoring was conducted by PT SUCOFINDO&#13;
       laboratories.&#13;
&#13;
       Peer reviewers of the Indonesia report came from the Sanitation Technical Team (TTPS), academics,&#13;
       and the sanitation donor group. The TTPS is a national taskforce and cross-sectoral team responsible for&#13;
       promoting sanitation sector development in Indonesia. The leading agency of the team is the National&#13;
       Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) and the members are the Ministry of Health, the Ministry&#13;
       of Public Works, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and&#13;
       the Ministry of Environmental Affairs. The valuable inputs of the TTPS and its members at meetings&#13;
       held at study initiation and during write-up are greatly appreciated. Also, valuable peer review comments&#13;
       were received from Sophie Tremolet (Tremolet Consulting Ltd), Isabel Blackett (WSP Senior Sanitation&#13;
       Specialist), Irwan Sumadji (Lecturer, University of Indonesia) and Richard Pollard (ECA region, World&#13;
       Bank), for which the study team is extremely grateful.&#13;
&#13;
       The ESI has been financed by the regional component of the Sustainable Sanitation in East Asia (SUSEA)&#13;
       program, which is funded by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA). The Asian&#13;
       Development Bank co-financed the consultant teams in Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam. The study in&#13;
       Yunnan Province (China) was co-financed by ECO-Asia. WSP and the report authors are grateful to the&#13;
       funding agencies for their support.&#13;

Sanitation is receiving increasing attention from all levels                             ment and the substantial State budget deficits. The annual&#13;
of government in Indonesia, after being a largely forgotten                              budget allocations for sanitation remains insubstantial at&#13;
issue in the past 15 years following Asian financial crisis of                           0.03% of national government spending in recent years2.&#13;
1997-98 with its serious deleterious effect on the State bud-                            Since 2010, a specific budget for sanitation exists (as op-&#13;
get. Recently the Government of Indonesia has made con-                                  posed to be subsumed into water supply). Figure 1 shows&#13;
siderable efforts to mobilize additional resources in order                              the increasing State budget.&#13;
to finance the countryâ&#128;&#153;s needs for infrastructure projects.&#13;
However, investment in sanitation remains less politically                               At the national level, there exists a cross-sectoral task team&#13;
and financially attractive than sectors such as energy and                               called Sanitation Technical Team (SanTT/TTPS), which&#13;
transport, due to the tight monetary policy of the Govern-                               was established in 2008 to promote the development of the&#13;

    Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), Ministry of                                  coverage figures, has also presented different coverage fig-&#13;
    Public Works (MPW), Ministry of Health (MoH), Minis-                                 ures. The survey, conducted in 2007, reported that 57% of&#13;
    try of Home Affairs (MoHA), Ministry of Finance (MoF),                               all households have a private toilet, 10% of the households&#13;
    Ministry of Environmental Affairs (MEA) and the Ministry                             use shared facilities, and the remaining 33% do not have&#13;
    of Industry (MoI). The team and its stakeholders, which                              a toilet. Hence, this amounts to a proportion of persons&#13;
    includes the Sanitation Donor Group (SDG), have already                              with access to basic of sanitation â&#128;&#148; in this case private and&#13;
    delivered many sanitation-related initiatives both at nation-                        shared toilets â&#128;&#148; to 67%, which is only a relatively small&#13;
    al as well as local levels. This is part of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s ef-                     difference from SUSENAS result. According to DHS, the&#13;
    forts to increase the access of improved sanitation facilities                       urban-rural differences of having a private toilet are quite&#13;
    according to the Millennium Development Goal (MDG)                                   significant: 75% of urban households compared to only&#13;
    target for water supply and sanitation.                                              43% in rural areas enjoy the privilege of a private latrine.&#13;

  VOSL studies attempt to value what individuals are willing to pay to reduce the risk of death (e.g. safety measures) willing to accept for an increase in the risk of&#13;
death. These values are extracted either from observations of actual market and individual behavior (â&#128;&#152;hedonic pricingâ&#128;&#153;) or from what individuals stated in relation to&#13;
their preferences from interviews or written tests (â&#128;&#152;contingent valuationâ&#128;&#153;). Both these approaches estimate directly the willingness to pay of individuals, or society, for a&#13;
reduction in the risk of death, and hence are more closely associated with actual welfare loss compared with the HCA.&#13;

  During the study design phase, the idea of having an â&#128;&#156;Intervention Areaâ&#128;? and â&#128;&#156;Control Areaâ&#128;? was conceived. However, during the actual field study, it was&#13;
found that no pure intervention areas nor pure control areas actually existed. Hence, the respondents were a mix of those who still practice open defection&#13;
and those who have or use private toilets, shared toilets or community toilets.&#13;

3.5.5	 NATIONAL WATER STATISTICS&#13;
National water quality data were collected and presented in&#13;
the sanitation â&#128;&#152;impactâ&#128;&#153; study, covering mainly surface water&#13;
of major lakes and rivers. Hence, this present study updates&#13;
those data to provide a national level picture of the qual-&#13;
ity of water resources, including ground water quality. The&#13;
secondary data collection was mainly obtained from water&#13;
and sanitation related documents at AMPL, a national level&#13;
water and sanitation working group, and the Indonesia&#13;
Sanitation Sector Development Program (ISSDP). Other&#13;
sources are official websites of related government bodies&#13;
such as provincial and city/district level environmental con-&#13;
trol bodies.&#13;
&#13;
An increase of 1 mg/liter of BOD pollution will lead to an&#13;
increase of about 25% in the national average of drinking&#13;
water production costs.13&#13;
&#13;
Poor or non-existent drainage systems in urban areas have&#13;
received a high public profile due to regular flooding (e.g.&#13;
Jakarta, where some parts of the city are regularly flooded&#13;
during the rainy season, and occasionally there is severe&#13;
flooding). Poor sanitation such as insufficient drainage or&#13;
unimproved solid waste disposal (thus blocking drains) can&#13;
lead to avoidable flooding in rainy season. Also, inappro-&#13;
priate sanitation options in seasonally flooded rural areas&#13;
can lead to avoidable surface water pollution and health&#13;
hazards. Therefore, this study collected secondary evidence&#13;
from government and donor assessments, university re-&#13;
search, and media reports of flooding incidents, focusing&#13;

 choose an option that was affordable to them and met their                          and no pit overflow. In Lamongan, about 10% of respon-&#13;

 and Malang were given a full range of options, in Payakum-                          (Figure 63).&#13;
 buh, the options were fewer. The most likely reason for this&#13;
 is that the CLTS program focuses not on subsidizing latrine                         Table 43 presents selected indicators of the overall effective-&#13;

 from open defecation. The CLTS facilitators do not lecture                          to the cost-benefit analysis (see Chapter 8).&#13;
 or advise on sanitation habits, and do not provide external&#13;
 solutions, such as toilet designs. Rather, the aim is to trig-                      Key conclusions from these indicators of program effective-&#13;

 TABLE A 4. AGGREGATING EQUATIONS FOR COST-BENEFIT AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS&#13;
&#13;
Cost-Benefit Analysis:&#13;
&#13;
1)	 Benefit-cost ratios (BCR)&#13;
       o	 BCR (benefit cost ratio = PVB / PVC) where PVB = Present Value of Benefit and PVC = Present Value of Cost&#13;
       o	 It has to present an answer to the question: â&#128;&#156;Are the benefits greater than the costs&#13;
&#13;
2)	 Net present value (NPV)&#13;
       o	 NPV is the sum of all terms of discounted cash inflow/outflow (present value or PV)&#13;
&#13;
                                                 PV = NCFt /(1+i)t&#13;
&#13;
where&#13;
&#13;
        o	 t - the time of the cash flow&#13;
        o	 i - the discount rate (the rate of return that could be earned on an investment in the financial markets with similar risk.)&#13;
        o	 NCFt is the net cash flow (the amount of cash, inflow minus outflow) at time t.&#13;
        o	 It provides an answer to the question: â&#128;&#156;What the investment worth is in todayâ&#128;&#153;s money? â&#128;&#156;&#13;
&#13;
3)	 Internal rate of return (IRR): Given the (period, cash flow) pairs (n, Cn) where n is a positive integer, the total number of periods N,&#13;
    and the net present value NPV, the internal rate of return is given by r in:&#13;

ANNEX N: STEPS OF THE FIELD SURVEY IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
                     Briefing for field coordinators&#13;
&#13;
                     Field coordinators were recruited in Jakarta. Before leaving for the field, they were briefed and received&#13;
                     training on their responsibilities in the field study. They were also involved in a pilot test of the household&#13;
                     questionnaire and observational component, and the health facility study.&#13;
&#13;
                     Each coordinator was responsible for all data collection processes in the field where she/he was assigned,&#13;
                     including FGD implementation and all required arrangements with local stakeholders to get their support&#13;
                     and inputs. In each site, the Field Coordinator was assisted by one local counterpart. The local counterpart&#13;
                     assisted the Field Coordinator to recruit interviewers/enumerators, obtain survey permit from the local&#13;
                     authorities, help with enumerators training, and support all data collection processes. The criteria of&#13;
                     enumerator recruitment were:&#13;
&#13;
                         â&#136;&#146;â&#136;&#146;   Experienced with activities related to local communities and local government,&#13;
                         â&#136;&#146;â&#136;&#146;   Good verbal communication skills,&#13;
                         â&#136;&#146;â&#136;&#146;   Understand sanitation issues,&#13;
                         â&#136;&#146;â&#136;&#146;   Fully committed to get the data collection done.&#13;
&#13;
                     There were 8 interviewers in each survey site. Most of them were graduated from public health faculty or&#13;
                     health workers/cadres. Most interviewers were women.&#13;
&#13;
                     Training for interviewers&#13;
&#13;
                     The selected candidates for interviewers/enumerators in each site were given an intensive 3 day training&#13;
                     on conducting the field survey. The training was facilitated by the ESI Team from PT. MLD who was also&#13;
                     assisted by each field coordinator and local counterparts. The training aimed at giving the interviewers/&#13;
                     enumerators an adequate level of comprehension to conduct the HH survey. There were classroom sessions&#13;
                     as well as field testing in a village near the training location. The interview tests were evaluated in the&#13;
                     classroom to assess whether the questionnaires were practical enough.&#13;
&#13;
                     Field preparation and household interviews&#13;
&#13;
                     The field preparation encompassed determining a base camp, preparing interviewers training, and&#13;
                     contacting all related parties to ensure successful survey, such as getting research permit at village level.&#13;
                     The samples or respondents were gathered from the field sites by creating a list of targeted households,&#13;
                     with special focus on families with children under-five. The process involved field personnel, such as&#13;
                     enumerators and local health cadres and involved the following steps:&#13;
&#13;
                         â&#136;&#146;â&#136;&#146; Visiting the selected villages to identify and record the number and names of under-five children in&#13;
                            those villages,&#13;
                         â&#136;&#146;â&#136;&#146; Visiting local midwifery clinics or midwife practitioners to get additional data of families with&#13;
                            under-five children,&#13;
                         â&#136;&#146;â&#136;&#146; Once the respondent candidates list was completed, the field personnel selected them randomly to&#13;
                            be interviewed.&#13;

                      The household survey team collected data by visiting the respondentsâ&#128;&#153; houses. With household&#13;
                      questionnaires in hand, the enumerators interviewed the housewives for 40-60 minutes, including a direct&#13;
                      observation of their toilet facilities. The household survey did not encounter significant problems, except&#13;
                      for revisiting the house when the selected respondents were not at home because they were working.&#13;
&#13;
                      To ensure the quality of data collection in the field, the interviewers and the field coordinator conducted&#13;
                      data reconciliation every end of the day after the interviews. There were three stages to verify the&#13;
                      questionnaire responses:&#13;
&#13;
                      1.	 The first stage: peer review among interviewers. The result of an interviewer was verified by another&#13;
                          interviewer until all questionnaire responses of that day were all cross-checked. The purpose of this stage&#13;
                          was to make sure that all questions in the questionnaires were properly filled out,&#13;
&#13;
                      2.	 The second stage: the field coordinator thoroughly reviewed all questionnaire responses. The purpose of&#13;
                          this stage was to ensure no mistakes in filling in of the questionnaire,&#13;
&#13;
                      3.	 The third stage: the field coordinator randomly revisited some respondents to verify that the respondents&#13;
                          were really interviewed by the interviewers.&#13;
&#13;
                      These verification stages were conducted during the field surveys to ensure prompt actions were taken&#13;
                      following identification of problems related to the questionnaires. For instance, should there be a&#13;
                      questionnaire that has not been properly filled out, the field coordinator would ask the interviewer to visit&#13;
                      the respondent of that particular questionnaire again and would make sure that all questions are answered.&#13;
                      If the interviewer failed to meet a certain respondent until the second visit, then the respondent would&#13;
                      be replaced with the following person in the respondent list. Employing such verification method in this&#13;
                      study resulted in zero non-response or error response rate and credible confidential data to be processed. At&#13;
                      the same time, there were parallel data collection activities in each site survey (see below).&#13;

            Economic assessment of sanitation
            interventions in Indonesia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Statistics from the UN Joint Monitoring
            Program show sanitation progress in Indonesia to be
            off-track coverage has to increase by more than 13
            percentage points nationally from 2008 to 2015 to meet the
            sanitation target of the Millennium Development Goals, which
            the Government of Indonesia committed to in 2002. However,
            after being a largely forgotten issue in the 15 years
            following the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, sanitation
            is now receiving increasing attention from all levels of
            government in Indonesia. Recently the Government of
            Indonesia has made considerable efforts to mobilize
            additional resources in order to finance the country's
            needs for infrastructure projects. The purpose of the
            Economics of Sanitation Initiative (ESI) is to promote
            evidence-based decision making using improved methodologies
            and data sets, thus increasing the effectiveness and
            sustainability of public and private sanitation spending.
            Better decision making techniques and economic evidence
            themselves are also expected to stimulate additional
            spending on sanitation to meet and surpass national coverage
            targets. The specific purpose of the ESI phase two studies
            is to generate robust evidence on the costs and benefits of
            sanitation improvements in different programmatic and
            geographic contexts in Indonesia, leading to information
            about which are more efficient and sustainable sanitation
            interventions and programs. Basic hygiene aspects are also
            included, insofar as they affect health outcomes.
