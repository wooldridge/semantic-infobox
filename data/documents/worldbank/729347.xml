Measuring the Impact of Energy&#13;
Reform Practical Options&#13;
TWien Foster      Government interventions in energy markets have many effects on the poor. But there has been&#13;
little measurement of these effects, making it hard to know exactly what the effects of a project&#13;
have been, and hard to compare those of different interventions. This could be rectified by&#13;
building impact indicators into energy projects at the design phase-and doing so consistently&#13;
and systematically, across countries and over time. This Note discusses the development of&#13;
suitable indicators. First, agreement is needed on workable definitions of poverty and what would&#13;
constitute welfare improvements for the poor. Then there must be explicit hypotheses on how&#13;
specific elements of energy projects, individually or together, affect the poor. Finally, the&#13;
indicators must be based on data that can realistically be collected in real-life low-income&#13;
communities, in real-life developing countries.&#13;

            Measuring the impact of energy reform :
            practical options
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Government interventions in energy
            markets have many effects on the poor. But there has been
            little measurement of these effects, making it hard to know
            exactly what the effects of a project have been, and hard to
            compare those of different interventions. This could be
            rectified by building impact indicators into energy projects
            at the design phase--and doing so consistently and
            systematically, across countries and over time. This Note
            discusses the development of suitable indicators. First,
            agreement is needed on workable definitionsof poverty and
            what would constitute welfare improvements for the poor.
            Then there must be explicit hypotheses on how specific
            elements of energy projects, individually or together,
            affect the poor. Finally, the indicators must be based on
            data tha can be realistically be collected in real-life
            low-income communities, in real-life developing countries.
