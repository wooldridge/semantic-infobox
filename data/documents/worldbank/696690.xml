STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
Loan and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower                   The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan&#13;
Implementing Agency        The Central Bank of Jordan&#13;
Beneficiaries              Private-sector banks and enterprises&#13;
Loan Amount                US$40 million&#13;
Terms                      20 years, including a 5-year grace period, at the Bank's standard LIBOR-&#13;
based interest rate for US dollar single currency loans&#13;
Commitment Fee             0.75 percent on undisbursed loan balances, beginning 60 days after&#13;
signing, less any waiver&#13;
Onlending Terms            The Government would, through the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ),&#13;
onlend proceeds of the loan to private banks in US dollars or Jordanian&#13;
dinars (JD) at interest rates that reflect market conditions. Funds would&#13;
be onlent to participating banks (PBs) under subsidiary financing&#13;
agreements with CBJ. The PBs would make subloans to private&#13;
borrowers in US dollars or JD at terms to be freely determined, and&#13;
would bear the credit risk on the amounts onlent and commitment&#13;
charges. Subborrowers would need to have a total debt-equity ratio of&#13;
less than 2:1 and a minimum debt service ratio of 1:3. The maximum&#13;
repayment period for the subloans would be 7 years, including up to 3&#13;
years of grace. The maximum size of subloans would be US$2 million.&#13;
Project Objective&#13;
and Description            The principal objective of the project is to support the Government's&#13;
Export Sector Development Program, which aims at enhancing&#13;
international competitiveness of Jordanian exports and increasing export&#13;
revenues. The immediate objective of the project is to help private&#13;
firms expand their productive capacity through a credit line for term&#13;
lending.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
.i;&#13;
Subloans under the credit line would finance viable medium- and longer-&#13;
term investments in plant and machinery in productive activities (real&#13;
estate and housing are not eligible); permanent working capital,&#13;
marketing and training associated with new investments; and investments&#13;
in energy conservation and pollution control equipment. The PBs would&#13;
require detailed appraisal of the proposed subprojects in accordance with&#13;
the agreed eligibility criteria and operating guidelines, as specified in the&#13;
subsidiary financing agreements.&#13;
Benefits and Risks           The principal benefit of the project would be the expanded productive&#13;
capacity of Jordanian private firns. Approximately 80 firms would&#13;
receive subloans to make the investments necessary to develop capacity&#13;
to exploit export opportunities. It is expected that these investments&#13;
would generate about 1,000 additional jobs, thereby raising total&#13;
employment. The participation of private banks in the project would also&#13;
enhance financial sector competition and build project-financing&#13;
capabilities. The eligibility criteria for subprojects include a minimum&#13;
financial rate of return of 15 percent, which is considered a good proxy&#13;
for the economic rate of return.&#13;
Deterioration of macroeconomic conditions as a result of various factors,&#13;
including adverse capital movements, could delay disbursements.&#13;
However, the risk is small given the commitment the Government has&#13;
demonstrated to maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment,&#13;
including flexible exchange and interest rate policies, under adjustment&#13;
programs supported by the Bank and IMF. Additionally, Jordanian banks&#13;
are relatively new to project appraisal and term-lending techniques. This&#13;
risk will be addressed through close World Bank supervision-including&#13;
a project launch seminar-clearly specified operating guidelines and&#13;
eligibility criteria, and training of selected PB staff in project appraisal&#13;
seminars.&#13;

THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN&#13;
EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   Following strong economic growth over 1973-1984, Jordan's GDP contracted by an annual&#13;
average of 1.2 percent during 1985-89 as a result of the oil crisis. This reflected declines in output,&#13;
consumption, employment and investment. In response, the Government adopted a stabilization and&#13;
adjustment program, backed by the IMF and the World Bank, to trim budget deficits, reduce foreign&#13;
exchange controls, and implement other deregulatory measures. Concurrently, the Paris Club and the&#13;
London Club rescheduled Jordan's external debt payments. As a result, real GDP growth climbed to 6&#13;
percent by 1992, inflation fell below 5 percent, unemployment declined from 25 percent to 15 percent,&#13;
and external debt as a percentage of GDP fell to 120 percent, after peaking at 190 percent in 1990.&#13;
1.2    While this progress has been significant, Jordan still faces major challenges in maintaining its&#13;
positive economic momentum. The primary sources that have supported its balance of payments and&#13;
public investments-remittances, official grants, concessional assistance, and regional trade under&#13;
noncompetitive protocol trade arrangements-are untenable as a foundation for sustained growth. The&#13;
domestic economy is small and regional markets offer limited employment opportunities. Jordan,&#13;
therefore, needs to build its export competitiveness and integrate into the global economy to exploit the&#13;
benefits of rapidly expanding world trade. The regional peace process, potential partnership status in the&#13;
European Union and membership in WTO provide Jordan unprecedented opportunities to do so.&#13;
1I. CONSTRAINTS TO EXPORT COMPETITIVENESS AND GOVERNMENT STRATEGY&#13;
A. Characteristics of the Export Sector&#13;
2.1    In 1994 the value of Jordan's exports was about one-third that of imports despite 6 percent a year&#13;
real export growth of over 1990-94. Jordan's exports are concentrated in natural resource industries,&#13;
such as phosphate- and potash-based products, which represented 36 percent of all exports in 1994.&#13;
More than half of manufacturing is concentrated in pharmaceuticals, food, beverages, clothing, wood,&#13;
and furniture. Firms are small, with 98 percent employing fewer than 20 workers. High tariffs and&#13;
transaction costs, institutional and regulatory rigidities, weak enterprise support systems, and limited term&#13;
finance have hurt the competitive position of Jordanian firms and left them ill equipped to compete in the&#13;
global marketplace. Firms have relied on intergovernmental barter trade (protocol) arrangements with&#13;
neighboring countries, which has further shielded them from developing the know-how needed to produce&#13;
for, or sell in, global markets. While nontraditional exports (those other than natural resource industries)&#13;
rose significantly-from -2 percent per annum in real terms between 1985 to 1990 to 10 percent between&#13;
1991 and 1994, Jordan needs to accelerate the momentum of its export growth and eliminate the policy,&#13;
institutional, technological, and financial bottlenecks that restrain export-led growth.&#13;
B. The Government's Export Strategy&#13;
2.2    The centerpiece of the Government's strategy is private-sector led, outward-oriented growth. The&#13;
strategy has three main thrusts: (i) policy reforms to create an enabling environment for the private sector&#13;
to develop; (ii) institutional and administrative reforms, coupled with support to private firms for&#13;
acquisition of technical and marketing skills, to enhance international competitiveness; and (iii) reforms&#13;
to deepen the financial sector and improve private-sector access to investment finance. These reforms&#13;
are outlined in the Government's September 1995 Letter of Development Policy for the Economic Reform&#13;
and Development Loan (ERDL, Loan 3947-JO). On the policy side, with support from ERDL, Jordan&#13;
has already reduced maximum tariffs for non-luxury goods from 70 to 50 percent; consolidated taxes and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                                                Export Development Project&#13;
surcharges into tariffs; reduced tariff exemptions; lowered border taxes on almost 500 capital goods&#13;
categories; and effectively eliminated import licensing requirements. Parliament recently enacted a new&#13;
Investment Law, for which IBRD and FIAS provided advice (Figure 1), and amended the Income Tax&#13;
Law, reducing maximum corporate tax rates from 55 to 35 percent. The Government, with support from&#13;
the proposed ERDL II, plans to carry out further trade reformns, accelerate privatization, and reduce&#13;
regulatory and administrative constraints to private-sector growth.&#13;
2.3     The Government also recognizes that trade liberalization and other broad economic policy changes&#13;
will not, alone, deliver sustained growth, and that measures need to be put in place to generate a speedy&#13;
and effective supply response. It has, thus, with Bank assistance, prepared an Export Sector Development&#13;
Program and presented it in a Letter of Export Sector Development Policy to the Bank on March 7, 1996&#13;
(Annex 1). The letter confirms the Government's commitment to carrying out the Program.&#13;
2.4     The Program, which is to be financed by the Bank and donors, focuses on two key areas. The&#13;
first is -strengthening the legal framework and institutional and firrn-level capabilities to foster&#13;
competitiveness of Jordanian goods in global markets. 'This includes streamlining import and export&#13;
procedures and reducing related transaction costs; facilitating investments; and improving product&#13;
standards, quality and marketing. Figure 1 below summarizes the issues faced by existing and potential&#13;
exporters in these areas-Customs, free zone regime, investment mobilization, production for export-and&#13;
the corresponding actions the Government plans to take under the Program. These elements of the&#13;
Program  have drawn strong support from  donors, including GTZ, USAID, the European Union (EU),&#13;
Canada, and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development.&#13;
2.5     The Program's second area of focus is improving private firm  access to term  finance for&#13;
investments in productive capacity expansion. The project would address this element of the Program&#13;
through a credit line of US$40 million for onlending to private firns. The background on constraints&#13;
to term finance and details of the Bank support under the project to address those constraints are discussed&#13;
in the sections following Figure 1.&#13;

Customs Administration&#13;
Key issues with Customs are two-fold: (i) The Customs Law   The Government is drafting a new Customs Law in line&#13;

(ii) the procedures are cumbersome, discretionary, and  proposed EU partnership and WTO membership. The draft&#13;
lengthy, leading to high transaction costs. There are no  Law will be submitted to the Parliament in 1996. Customs&#13;

adequately trained: they set values at high levels to  reduced; a reference-based price system  established to&#13;

facilitation schemes such as duty drawback and temporary   Valuation Code); and enforcement and penalty structures&#13;
entry are complex, non-transparent and administratively  updated. Customs operations are to be automated, and staff&#13;
costly. Customs officers are rewarded with bonuses of 40  given intensive training. A merit-based incentive system&#13;

overzealous behavior.                                  providing grant financing to support the above reforms.&#13;

C. Term Finance&#13;
2.6     Constraints in Access to Term Finance. Shortage of term finance is a major constraint to Jordan's&#13;
export growth. Although Jordan has a well developed banking system, the financial sector on the whole&#13;
is not sufficiently deep. The banking sector caters mainly to financing trade and working capital&#13;
requirements of the private sector. The bulk of bank deposits are short-term and the capability of banks&#13;
to carry out term transformation is limited. The capital market is shallow and has been a marginal source&#13;
of funds to private Jordanian companies. Therefore, most private investors have to rely on internally&#13;
generated funds and borrowing from banks through overdrafts. This severely restricts investment in&#13;
projects that require long gestation periods. The very small size of the manufacturing sector, which&#13;
accounted for only 12 percent of GDP in 1994, is evidence of this. (Annex 2 provides an overview of&#13;
financial markets in Jordan.)&#13;
2.7     A Bank survey l of constraints faced by exporters identified limited availability of term resources&#13;
as a major bottleneck in competing with foreign firms and realizing their full export potential. Most of&#13;
the respondents indicated that they were unable to leverage internally generated funds with long-term&#13;
borrowing.2 A series of round-table discussions held with enterprises as part of project preparation also&#13;
1/      The project preparation mission conducted formal interviews with 28 current and potential exporters,&#13;
using a standard questionnaire. The survey results are presented in "Export Constraints Faced by&#13;
Jordanian Enterprises - A Survey of Jordanian Firms", Rhee and Katterbach, World Bank, December&#13;
1994. In addition, interviews were conducted with over 100 other small-and medium-size firms during&#13;
project preparation.&#13;
2/      For example, five firms in the survey indicated that they had enough demand to justify new investments&#13;
in plant and machinery of around JD300,000 each. However, since obtaining term finance was a&#13;
difficult and prolonged process, they would have to postpone capacity expansion until they accumulated&#13;
sufficient amounts of internally generated funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Export Development Project                                                                 5&#13;
confirmed the problem of limited access to term funds.  Most enterprises indicated that financial&#13;
institutions were reluctant to commit term funds to other than large clients.&#13;
2.8   Interviews with 15 private commercial and investment banks and analysis of their loan portfolios&#13;
also confirmed that there is a constraint in the availability of term finance for capacity expansion. The&#13;
banks acknowledged that they have not been able to satisfy the demand for term loans because their&#13;
deposit base is mainly short term. Over 70 percent of the loans extended by the banking system carry&#13;
maturities of less than a year, with 35 percent of all outstanding loans consisting of overdraft facilities.&#13;
In most instances, loans with repayment periods in excess of three years were restricted to large&#13;
companies, arranged either through loan syndication or through rolling over short-term credit facilities.&#13;
The transaction costs associated with loan syndication prevented most small and medium enterprises from&#13;
taking this route. Banks also acknowledged that fear of maturity mismatches prevented them from&#13;
frequently resorting to short-term credit rollovers, and that without an identified and reliable long-term&#13;
funding source, they would not expand their term-lending operations.&#13;
2.9    The government-owned Industrial Development Bank (IDB) is the main source of term credit for&#13;
the productive sector. IDB has traditionally relied on term funds exclusively from the Central Bank of&#13;
Jordan (CBJ), the Government, and concessional financing from bilateral sources. However, recent&#13;
monetary and fiscal restraints have prevented an increase in supply of funds from CBJ and the&#13;
Government, while concessional aid has become scarce. As a result, IDB's share of extended and&#13;
outstanding credit by the financial system is smaller than 8 percent. In addition, cumbersome approval&#13;
procedures and high collateral requirements have prevented most small and medium firms from obtaining&#13;
IDB term loans.&#13;
2.10   The capital market also has not been successful in providing firms with longer-term capital.&#13;
While there has been an increase in new equity issues, the main beneficiaries have been large established&#13;
companies. Small and medium enterprises have no access to equity or debt funds from the capital&#13;
market-the costs are too high, regulations onerous, and often it is not practical to finance modernization&#13;
or one-off equipment replacement needs through direct placements in the capital markets. Even larger&#13;
companies face constraints in accessing capital markets due to regulatory and transactional impediments&#13;
to smooth functioning of the stock exchange. The corporate bond market is underdeveloped because the&#13;
Companies Law imposes rigid and stringent conditions for issue of corporate debt and because the bond&#13;
market is accustomed to government guarantees on bond issues. As a result, even private investment and&#13;
commercial banks have not been able to use bond markets to fund their term-lending operations.&#13;
2.11   Private contractual savings institutions are small and mutual funds do not exist, aue important&#13;
reason being the absence of an appropriate and independent regulatory framework.  As a result,&#13;
institutional demand for either traded or privately placed corporate debt and equity is limited. Most of&#13;
the long-term financial savings generated in the economy through pension and retirement schemes are&#13;
held in the government-managed Social Security Corporation (SSC). Despite significant annual inflows&#13;
of long-term savings, SSC has not been successful in channeling these into the private sector (SSC assets&#13;
amount to about US$800 million equivalent). As SSC has most of its investments-by mandate-in short-&#13;
term bank deposits and in certificates of deposit (about 65 percent) or in housing loans, it has failed to&#13;
catalyze the growth of the equity and bond markets, and investment in corporate equity or debt&#13;
instruments is a very small percentage of its total assets. The insurance sector accounts for only around&#13;
4 percent of the total assets of the financial system; competition is limited and public confidence in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                                                   Export Development Project&#13;
insurance industry is low, mainly because of a weak regulatory and supervisory framework. The leasing&#13;
industry is not developed because of deficiencies in leasing laws.&#13;
2.12   Investment Requirement.  Deregulation of the real sectors such as telecommunications,&#13;
agriculture, and power have increased opportunities for private investment and will require term&#13;
resources. The impact of these developments is already being felt. In 1994, 123 projects with an&#13;
aggregate investment of JD 257 million were approved, nearly double the amount approved in 1992.&#13;
Annual imports of electrical and non-electrical machinery have increased from JD 150 million in 1990&#13;
to more than JD 360 million in 1994. Progress in the regional peace process and prospects for closer&#13;
cooperation with the EU are enhancing Jordan's attractiveness as a location for export-oriented production&#13;
facilities. Furthermore, tariff, investment, and tax reforms supported by ERDL will establish the&#13;
framework for increased competition; improved access to international markets under the proposed&#13;
exporter support program (Figure 1) will also create more demand for plant and machinery. Over the&#13;
period 1995-2000 gross fixed investment is projected to grow at a rate of 27 percent. This would require&#13;
a total investment of JD8.6 billion (US$12 billion equivalent). Out of this amount, JD2.6 billion (US$3.6&#13;
billion) would be required for machinery and equipment. It is unlikely that the Jordanian economy will&#13;
be able to finance such an investment from internal sources. As access to international capital markets&#13;
will expand only gradually, a major part of this financing requirement will need to be funded from&#13;
multilateral and bilateral sources. The project would finance a part of this requirement, albeit small, and&#13;
enable Jordan's private sector to undertake investment projects that contribute to economic growth and&#13;
generate jobs and foreign exchange.&#13;
2.13   Government Agenda to Deepen the Financial Sector. The Government has begun implementing&#13;
policy reforms with a view to deepening financial markets and improving intermediation efficiency.&#13;
Considerable progress has been made in strengthening the safety and soundness of the banking system;&#13;
commercial and investment banks are now required to follow Basle norms relating to capital adequacy&#13;
and, as reported by CBJ, most banks are already in compliance.  Prudential lending guidelines&#13;
conforming to international practices have been put in place; and loan loss-provisioning has been&#13;
increased, with bad and doubtful loans fully provided for. Tighter prudential lending guidelines, the&#13;
enhanced powers of CBJ to intervene in cases of incipient financial distress, and improved on-site and&#13;
off-site supervision have together resulted in a significant decline in bad loans, which are currently less&#13;
than 6 percent of outstanding loans. These measures aimed at improving the stability of the banking&#13;
system have been accompanied by changes in bank regulations aimed at enhancing competition and&#13;
intermediation efficiency. All interest rates have been deregulated and direct credit controls are being&#13;
replaced by indirect monetary control. Since 1993 CBJ has been issuing certificates of deposits as part&#13;
of its monetary management. In 1994 CBJ repealed regulations that restricted credit expansion to no&#13;
more than ten times the size of each bank's capital; in 1995 it aiso eliminated the credit-deposit ratio.&#13;
Recently, CBJ has also allowed banks to lend a portion of their foreign exchange deposits to domestic&#13;
borrowers. However, the ability of the banks to do this is constrained by the fact that most foreign&#13;
currency deposits are from non-residents and have short maturities.&#13;
2.14  In its Letter of Development Policy for ERDL, the Government identified additional actions to&#13;
further improve competition and efficiency in the financial system and increase the mobilization and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Export Development Project                                                                 7&#13;
intermediation of long-term savings by the capital markets, contractual savings institutions, and the&#13;
insurance industry. These actions include:&#13;
(a)    To enhance competition within the banking system for both deposits and loans, the&#13;
Government plans to remove reserve requirements on inter-bank deposits so as to&#13;
enhance flow of resources between banks; adopt more transparent financial disclosure&#13;
based on internationally accepted accounting principles; and further strengthen CBJ's on-&#13;
site and off-site supervision.  Also, in a move towards universal banking, the&#13;
Government intends to reduce the difference between reserve ratios applied to commercial&#13;
and investment banks to a maximum of 5 percent in 1996.&#13;
(b)    The specialized credit institutions will be reformed. Their special privileges will be&#13;
eliminated and they will be subject to the same regulatory regime as private commercial&#13;
and investment banks.&#13;
(c)    Capital markets will also undergo reform. Their operational and supervisory functions&#13;
will be separated; a modern trading, settlement, clearing and depository system installed;&#13;
transparency introduced to the regulation of brokers and underwriters; and fuller financial&#13;
disclosure guidelines based on internationally accepted accounting principles adopted.&#13;
(d)    The Companies Law will be amended. Pricing of equity issues will be determined by&#13;
the market and not by the "Issuing Committee"; companies will be allowed to issue&#13;
unsecured bonds, and the amount of such bonds will be permitted to exceed their paid-up&#13;
capital; and shareholders will be allowed 100 percent pre-emptive rights.&#13;
(e)    Finally, contractual savings institutions will be strengthened. The Insurance Law will be&#13;
modified to allow new entry under a strengthened and independent regulatory body;&#13;
private management of social security and pension schemes will be permitted; and the&#13;
Companies Law will be amended to permit establishment and supervision of private&#13;
mutual funds.&#13;
2.15   The long-term efforts discussed above, however, are not sufficient to deal with the immediate&#13;
need of firms for long-term funds, particularly in foreign exchange. With the resumption of economic&#13;
growth, and a strong economic liberalization program in place, private investments in Jordan are expected&#13;
to improve significantly and will need to be supported by term resources. Implementation of the&#13;
Government's medium-term economic development strategy would address constraints that now prevent&#13;
the financial system from fully responding to the investment finance needs of the real sectors. However,&#13;
the impact of the financial sector reforms will be felt only over the medium term. The line of credit will&#13;
enable the private sector to undertake investments that will enable the economy to grow and create jobs.&#13;
Increasing productive investment, especially for exports, is essential for the economy. The project (paras.&#13;
3.1-3.7) would therefore serve as a useful vehicle to support the private sector while the financial sector&#13;
reforms are being implemented and consolidated.&#13;
D. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.16   The project builds on the work done by the Bank on the industry and export sectors and policy&#13;
reforms in Jordan and is fully consistent with the Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                                                                     Export Development Project&#13;
discussed by the Board on October 24, 19953. The CAS reflects the Government's central theme:&#13;
promoting private-sector led, rapid and sustainable outward-oriented growth as a vehicle for reducing&#13;
poverty and unemployment. The project supports this objective by helping firms expand their productive&#13;
capacity and export potential. The Bank was also closely involved with the Jordanian public and private&#13;
sectors in preparing the Government's Export Sector Development Program. The project is an integral&#13;
part of this Program. In addition, the Bank played a catalytic role in attracting grant financing from&#13;
donors for the other components of the Program. The project will also support IFC's strategy of&#13;
developing Jordan's capital markets through new financial institutions, instruments, and services,&#13;
including investments in a credit rating agency, and possible support for establishing a leasing company.&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objective&#13;
3.1    The principal objective of the project is to support the Government's Export Sector Development&#13;
Program, which aims at enhancing international competitiveness of Jordanian exports and increasing&#13;
export revenues. The immediate objective of the project is to help private firms expand their productive&#13;
capacity through a credit line for term lending. The benefits of the project would be monitored through&#13;
a set of indicators agreed on with the Government [paras. 4.2 and 6.1 (c)].&#13;
B.  Project Description&#13;
3.2     Principal Features of the Line of Credit. The US$40 million credit line would provide private&#13;
banks with access to term resources at market rates for financing medium- and long-term investments in&#13;
plant and machinery for productive activities other than real estate and housing construction. The CBJ&#13;
would serve as the fiscal agent of the Government: it would onlend funds from the credit line to&#13;
participating banks (PBs) and monitor the performance of PBs. This arrangement would not impose any&#13;
significant new burdens on CBJ, which already closely monitors and supervises banks. As noted earlier,&#13;
in the last three to four years there has been considerable improvement in both on-site and off-site&#13;
supervision and in the authority available to CBJ in supervising and regulating banks.&#13;
3.3    The CBJ would onlend, under subsidiary financing agreements, only to financially strong private&#13;
commercial and investment banks that conform with all applicable banking laws and have at least a&#13;
satisfactory rating from CBJ.4 Funds would be onlent to eligible banks on a first-come, first-serve basis.&#13;
As part of the eligibility criteria, PBs would satisfy CBJ that they possess adequate skills in project&#13;
3/     Industry and Trade Policy Adjustment Loan (Ln. 3142-JO, 1989); 'Export Incentives and&#13;
Technological Capabilities' (Report No. 10228-JO, 1992); Economic Reform and Development Loan&#13;
(Ln. 3947-JO, 1995); and "Private Sector Assessment" (Report No. 14405-JO, 1995).&#13;
4/     The CBJ has adopted the Basle guidelines relating to capital adequacy, and has also issued detailed&#13;
guidelines relating to classification of loans that are in conformity with international practices. Most&#13;
Jordanian banks would meet these requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Export Development Project                                                                                 9&#13;
financing; alternatively, they would agree to strengthen their project appraisal and monitoring skills under&#13;
a plan acceptable to CBJ.&#13;
3.4     The Bank loan would be extended to the Government as a single currency loan in US dollars at&#13;
the Bank's standard LIBOR-based rate. The CBJ, on behalf of the Govermment, would onlend the&#13;
proceeds of the Bank loan to PBs in US dollars or Jordanian dinars (JD). Jordan has a relatively open&#13;
capital account and recently accepted the IMF's Article VIII obligations.  Under current market&#13;
conditions, the US dollar onlending rate would be LIBOR plus a spread of 100 basis points, and the JD&#13;
onlending rate would be the Jordanian Treasury Bill rate plus 50 basis points (including 25 basis points&#13;
to cover CBJ's administrative costs). The CBJ would review and adjust onlending rates every six&#13;
months, as required, and inform the Bank [para. 6. 1(b)].&#13;
3.5     Participatina Banks. To date, CBJ has prequalified six banks as potential borrowers; they have&#13;
confirmed their intention to enter into subsidiary financing agreements with CBJ. Table 1 provides&#13;
selected financial indicators on these banks. They account for 30 percent of the assets of private banks,&#13;
35 percent of loans, and 36 percent of deposits; and are well capitalized and profitable. Returns on&#13;
equity range from 5 to 23 percent. Given the number of banks, there will be adequate competition in&#13;
the use of the credit line.&#13;

3.6     The PBs would onlend these funds to private subborrowers in US dollars or Jordanian dinars, at&#13;
terms to be freely determined, and would bear the credit risk on the subborrowers and commitment&#13;
charges on the Bank loan. The maximum repayment period of any subloan would be 7 years, including&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                                                               Export Development Project&#13;
3 years grace. Eligibility criteria for subborrowers are designed to ensure that financing is extended for&#13;
sound projects promoted by creditworthy private-sector borrowers. To ensure that procedures for&#13;
onlending by PBs are kept simple, prior approval of CBJ would not be required except for the first two&#13;
subloans extended by each PB. The subborrowers would have to be majority privately owned and would&#13;
need to have a total debt-equity ratio of less than 2:1 and a minimum debt-service ratio of 1:3. A&#13;
minimum projected financial rate of return of 15 percent would be required for subprojects financed by&#13;
the subloans. The maximum size of individual subloans would be US$2 million. The subloans are&#13;
expected to finance about 80 subprojects, at an average subloan size of around US$500,000. Annex 3&#13;
details the terms and conditions of the credit line.&#13;
3.7    During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Goverm-nent that CBJ will: (a) implement&#13;
the project in accordance with the eligibility criteria for PBs, subborrowers, subloans, and subprojects;&#13;
and (b) review every six months and adjust US Dollar and JD onlending rates to reflect market&#13;
conditions. Signing of the subsidiary financing agreements between CBJ and at least two prequalified&#13;
banks to serve as PBs would be a condition of loan effectiveness [paras. 6.1(a), 3.4, 6.1(b) and 6.2,&#13;
respectively].&#13;
IV. PROJECT COST, FINANCING, AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Project Cost and Financing&#13;
4.1.   Total project cost is estimated at US$60 million, of which the foreign exchange component&#13;
represents US$40 million (67 percent). The Bank loan-US$40 million-would finance 100 percent of&#13;
the estimated foreign exchange cost. Borrowers of subloans would contribute an estimated US$20 million&#13;
(33 percent) and would cover applicable taxes and duties from their own funds. Annex 4 shows the&#13;
project cost and financing plan.&#13;
B. Project Implementation and Supervision&#13;
4.2   Impiementation. The CBJ will be the implementing agency; it has established a two-person unit,&#13;
supervised by the CBJ Executive Manager, External Debts and Agreements Department, to oversee&#13;
implementation of the project. The unit would monitor project performance, accounts, expenditures,&#13;
costs, and compliance with Bank guidelines; it would forward all withdrawal applications, reports and&#13;
other documentation to the Bank. Each PB would forward the first two subloan applications to CBJ and&#13;
the Bank for prior approval. Thereafter, the PBs would forward a subproject data sheet Xneach subloan&#13;
extended to CBJ which would tabulate the information for presentation to the Bank in its regular reports.&#13;
The format and coverage of the data sheets have been agreed with CBJ. In order to assess job creation&#13;
impact of the project, PBs would include information on projected new employment under the subloans&#13;
financed on the data sheets. Moreover, the Bank would review macro indicators of export performance&#13;
to determine the extent to which the Government's Export Sector Development Program is meeting its&#13;
objectives.&#13;
4.3    Supervision.  The project would be supervised twice a year.  The total number of Bank&#13;
supervision staff-weeks is estimated at 48, for a cost of US$200,000, of which 31 weeks would be spent&#13;
in the field at an estimated cost of US$124,000. The initial supervision mission would be a project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Export Development Project                                                               11&#13;
launch seminar to be held with the members of the CBJ implementation unit and PB representatives. The&#13;
seminar would discuss the Implementation Plan, including operating guidelines, disbursement, accounting&#13;
and auditing arrangements, and reporting requirements. A Mid-Term Review would be held in January&#13;
1998, in addition to Annual Reviews, to examine disbursement progress to date, subproject pipelines of&#13;
PBs, and availability of term finance and interest rates in general. The project supervision plan is&#13;
provided in Annex 5. During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government that a Mid-Term&#13;
Review will be carried out on or about January 1998 to assess progress and introduce any required&#13;
measures to improve project execution [para. 6.1(d)].&#13;
C. Procurement&#13;
4.4    Procurement of goods, services and works under the subloans would be carried out in accordance&#13;
with normal commercial practices of enterprises. These are acceptable to the Bank. The PBs would&#13;
maintain- records of procurement procedures and methods used, summarizing offers and awards for ex-&#13;
post review by the Bank on a periodic basis.&#13;
D. Disbursements&#13;
4.5    The project would be implemented over a four-year period, with a completion target date of&#13;
December 31, 1999. The commitment deadline for the credit line would be January 31, 1999. The loan&#13;
closing date would be June 30, 2000, six months following the project completion date.  The&#13;
disbursement period of 4 years or 16 quarters is shorter than the country disbursement profile of 6.5&#13;
years or 26 quarters. This is deemed achievable because the credit line, which is a relatively small&#13;
amount compared to anticipated demand for term funds, is expected to be disbursed within a reasonably&#13;
short time, as six banks have already confirmed their interest in and entering into subsidiary financing&#13;
agreements with CBJ. The estimated schedule of disbursements from proceeds of the Bank loan by&#13;
semesters is provided in Annex 7.&#13;
4.6    Special Account. To facilitate disbursements, the Government will open and maintain, under&#13;
terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special Account at CBJ with an authorized allocation of&#13;
US$4 million, representing 10 percent of the credit line. The Special Account will be replenished on&#13;
a monthly basis or when its balance is equal to 50 percent of the authorized allocation, whichever comes&#13;
first. Withdrawal applications will be supported by appropriate documentation, including a copy of the&#13;
monthly bank statements and their reconciliation with the Special Account transactions. Disbursements&#13;
can be made through direct payment or special commitments (subject to a minimum application size of&#13;
US$800,000) from the Bank.&#13;
E. Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting&#13;
4.7    The Borrower is in compliance with IBRD audit reporting covenants. During negotiations, the&#13;
Government gave assurances that: (a) project accounts, including the Special Account, will be maintained&#13;
in a format acceptable to the Bank and audited in accordance with Bank guidelines; and (b) the audit&#13;
reports will be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal year, in such scope and&#13;
detail as the Bank may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by an independent auditor&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, on disbursements against the Special Account [para. 6. l(e)].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                                                Export Development Project&#13;
4.8    Reporting. In addition to monthly status update forms, which would include information on&#13;
disbursements, CBJ would submit annual imnplementation progress reports in November of each year, to&#13;
the Bank. The update forms and reports would follow a standardized format that would be finalized&#13;
during the project launch seminar. They would cover implementation status; deviations, if any, from the&#13;
Implementation Plan and reasons; problems and constraints, and the corrective actions being taken; and&#13;
updated disbursement and commitment tables. CBJ would also prepare a detailed Mid-Term Report and&#13;
submit it to the Bank by end November 1997 to serve as the basis for the Mid-Term Review, and an&#13;
Implementation Completion Report to the Bank within six months of the Closing Date of the Bank loan.&#13;
F. Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement&#13;
4.9    The Bank has not been involved in an industrial credit finance operation in Jordan since the late&#13;
1970s; however, the lessons of Bank experience with such operations in other countries are reflected in&#13;
the design of the credit line. Specifically, funds would be onlent to eligible private banks at market&#13;
interest rates on a first-come, first-serve basis, and the- participating banks would price the subloans&#13;
freely. In addition, the macroeconomic environment is stable, inflation is low, interest rates are&#13;
deregulated, and the credit line would not be distortionary. Bank experience also shows that prospects&#13;
for achieving sustainable export competitiveness are greatly enhanced through a comprehensive approach&#13;
covering relevant policy and institutional reforms, support mechanisms to improve technical and&#13;
marketing know-how  at the firm  level, and availability of investment financing.  The parallel&#13;
implementation of this project with the rest of the Government's Export Sector Development Program,&#13;
complemented by policy reforms supported by ERDL operations, provides such an approach.&#13;
G. Project Sustainability&#13;
4.10    The project would enhance the capacity of participating banks to provide term finance and to&#13;
lend in foreign exchange. It would thereby create a base for increased longer-term lending under the&#13;
financial sector reforms that will be deepened with support from ERDL II. To help ensure sustainability,&#13;
the design of the credit line has been based on market conditions. Also, it is expected that the credit line&#13;
will serve as a catalyst to stimulate term finance by the banks. However, as the financial markets are not&#13;
yet sufficiently deep and term transformation limited, further support through credit lines may be needed&#13;
until the financial sector reforms take hold.&#13;
H. Project Objective Category&#13;
4.11    The project objective is classified under "Private Sector Development".&#13;
I. Environmental Impact&#13;
4.12  In view of the potential environmental impact of subprojects financed under the credit line, the&#13;
project is rated under Environmental Category "B." The PBs will ensure that each subproject application&#13;
under the credit line will comply with environmental standards satisfactory to the Bank and applicable&#13;
laws and regulations of the Government relating to health, safety and environmental protection. For this&#13;
purpose, the Bank has prepared an environmental manual for use by PBs to screen subloan applications&#13;
for environmental impact of proposed subprojects.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Export Development Project                                                            13&#13;
J. Participatory Approach&#13;
4.13 The project was prepared jointly with the Government, CBJ, and private sector firms and banks.&#13;
Interviews and group meetings were held with 125 firms and 15 of the 21 banks. The eligibility criteria&#13;
and operating procedures were developed with CBJ, taking into account the results of the interviews, as&#13;
well as Bank experience with credit lines. As part of the Bank support to the Government in formulating&#13;
its Export Sector Development Program, workshops were held in December 1994 and January 1995 with&#13;
public and private sector representatives on Jordan's export performance, elements of modern Customs&#13;
legislation, and international competitiveness.&#13;
V. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
5.1    The project would give Jordanian firms a timely opportunity to enhance their competitiveness and&#13;
productive capacity to enable them to participate more effectively in the global economy-either directly&#13;
or through joint ventures with regional or extra-regional partners. Approximately 80 firms would receive&#13;
subloans to make the investments necessary to develop capacity to exploit export opportunities. In&#13;
addition to increasing trade integration, it is expected that these investments would generate about 1,000&#13;
additional jobs, thereby raising total employment. Another benefit of the project would be to improve&#13;
access to term lending. The participation of private banks in the project would also improve financial&#13;
intermediation, enhance financial sector competition and build project-financing capabilities. The&#13;
eligibility criteria for subprojects include a minimum financial rate of return of 15 percent, which is&#13;
considered a good proxy for the economic rate of return of the project.&#13;
B. Project Risks&#13;
5.2    Deterioration of macroeconomic conditions as a result of various factors, including adverse&#13;
capital movements, could delay disbursements. However, the risk is small given the commitment the&#13;
Government has demonstrated to maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment, including flexible&#13;
exchange and interest rate policies, under adjustment programs supported by the Bank and IMF.&#13;
Additionally, Jordanian banks are relatively new to project appraisal and term-lending techniques. This&#13;
risk will be addressed through close Bank supervision-including a project launch seminar-clearly&#13;
specified operating guidelines and eligibility criteria, and training of selected PB staff in project appraisal&#13;
seminars.&#13;
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED&#13;
6.1    During negotiations, Government gave assurances that it will cause CBJ to:&#13;
(a)   implement the project in accordance with the eligibility criteria for participating banks,&#13;
subborrowers, subloans, and subprojects (para. 3.7);&#13;
(b)   review, every six months, and adjust US dollar and JD onlending rates to reflect market&#13;
conditions (paras. 3.4 and 3.7);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                                                Export Development Project&#13;
(c)    carry out the project in accordance with the Implementation Plan, including target dates&#13;
of actions to be taken and monitoring indicators (paras. 3.1 and 4.2);&#13;
(d)    carry out a Mid-Term Review on or about January 1998 to assess progress and introduce&#13;
any required measures to improve project execution (para. 4.3); and&#13;
(e)    ensure that (i) project accounts, including the Special Account, is maintained in a format&#13;
acceptable to the Bank and audited in accordance with Bank guidelines; and (ii) the audit&#13;
reports are submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal year, in&#13;
such scope and detail as the Bank may reasonably request, including a separate opinion&#13;
by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank on the Special Account (para. 4.7).&#13;
6.2    As a condition of loan effectiveness, subsidiary financing agreements shall have been signed&#13;
between CBJ and at least two prequalified banks to serve as participating banks (para.3.7).&#13;
6.3    The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis 'for a Bank loan to the Hashemite Kingdom of&#13;
Jordan in the amount of US$40 million at the Bank's standard LIBOR-based interest rate for US dollar&#13;
single currency loans, with a maturity of 20 years, including a 5-year grace period.&#13;

Mr. James D. Wolfen.sohn&#13;
President&#13;
The World Bank&#13;
Washington, DC.&#13;
U. S.A-&#13;
Dear Wr. President:&#13;
Letter of Export Sector Development Policy&#13;
1.    As an integral part of its ongoing structural adjustment effort, The Govei nent of&#13;
The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is pursuing a specific action- oriented prceram to&#13;
boost the efficiency, international competitiveness, and global market orientaticni of its&#13;
cxport sector. This letter describes the programs Iordan is undertaking, and confirms the&#13;
Government's comrmitment to carry out their implementation  The Government also&#13;
confirms its intention to seek a loan of USS 40 million from the World Bank to support&#13;
priority cornponents of its export development program.&#13;
2.    The action prograrn is designed to raise the international competitiveness of&#13;
exporting firms, increase export revenues by reducing trade transaction costs, liberalize the&#13;
free-trade zone regime, facilitate and promote investments, adopt intemational quality&#13;
standards, facilitate access of Jordanian firms to technical and marketing know-how, and&#13;
improve the access of firms to long-term financing.&#13;
L      Background&#13;
3.    Jordan's economy has shown consistent growth since 1992 when th: reform&#13;
program was rejuvenated aftcr the Gulf crisis. Preliminary estimates of GDP for 1995&#13;
show a growth of about 6.4 percent, led mainly by the increases in the output of&#13;
agriculture and mining sectors, which grew at 6 percent and 18 percent respectively.&#13;
Inflation remained below 4 percent and the extermal current aCcouat deficit was fiurther&#13;
reduced in 1995 by 1.5 percentage points to less than 5 percent of GDP. The export&#13;
sector also showed improvement. Merchandise exports increased by 14 percent in 1994&#13;
and 19.4 percent in 1995. The latter showed a strong performance of nontraditional&#13;
exports (which expanded by 24 percent). Tmport payments declined in nomina1 terms in&#13;
1994, but showed a shift in favor of raw materials a.nd capital equipment, which allowed&#13;

for sustained econorric expansion. This shift conLinued in 1995, with imports going up by&#13;
11 1 percent, but those of raw materials increasing by 34.6 percenc. While the trade dcficit&#13;
remains high at about 31 percent of GDP, the government expects that the policies it is&#13;
pursuing to boost exports will bring it down to manageable levels over the next three to&#13;
five years.&#13;
4.    MIr. President, the Government of Jordan subriitted a medium-term economic&#13;
framework to the World Bank in a development policy letter dated September 25, 1995.&#13;
This programn is  well into its implementation phase and includcs major policy and&#13;
legislative reforms.  Actions already completed during  1995 include: removal of&#13;
cumbersome import licensing requirements; lowering and restucturing tariff; lowering&#13;
income taxes and streamlining tax procedures; equalizing domestic taxes on imports and&#13;
locally produced goods; and strengthening investment incentives to make tho business&#13;
environment more investment friendly.&#13;
5.    We strongly believe that the legislative and procedural changes recently introduced&#13;
will increase traasparency in the trade and banking regulations, simplify proccdures, and&#13;
reduce bureaucracy to enhance the private sector busincss environment. These measures,&#13;
-along with our futura straLegy of futher dcepening economic liberalization and reform,&#13;
are expected to contribute in a substantive way to our efforts to strengthen Jordan's&#13;
private sector, enhance its export potential, and bring about the developments nec.;-ary to&#13;
prepare our econoiny for further integration with the world economy.&#13;
6.     Sections II and 11 below describe the government's policy rationale for according&#13;
high priority to the export sector and a program of action in the policy, regulatory, and&#13;
procedural areas to achieve the desired results.&#13;
IL    Exports: A Priority Sector&#13;
7.    Concurrently with progress being made in the overall economic reform pxograrn,&#13;
the Government is focusing extraordinary attention to the development of its export sector&#13;
as a key element in sustaining a healthy economic growth over the mcdium-termL As we&#13;
make progress in negotiating trade agreements with the European Union and the World&#13;
Trade Organization (WTO), the need to organize the export scetor has become more&#13;
imminent. The challenges and opportunities generated by the progress in the rcgional&#13;
peace process exert further pressure to expedite this task. Expansion in intra-regional&#13;
tradc and new foreiga investments over the next two to three years is the most likely&#13;
expectation in Jordan.&#13;
8     lJordan's privatc sector, though willing and aware of these opportunities, needs&#13;
improvement. The majority of Jordanian exports are concentrated in natural resource&#13;
industries and primary products. Jordanian businesses remain small relative to their global&#13;
competitors, and their lack of intemational trade experience remains a serious handicap.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
9.    The overall development sLrategy for poverty reduction, employmnent generation&#13;
and improving Jordan's export potential rests on the roUowing three main policy dccisions&#13;
to which the govcrnment remains firmly committed;&#13;
*    A deliberate, private sector-led export oriented strategy will be followed to&#13;
diversify markets, increase private sector investments and improve the nation's&#13;
trade balance.&#13;
*    Economic growth will be sustained through; (a) increased investments in high&#13;
return expoLt-oriented industries; (b) eMicicncy and quality improvernents in&#13;
the productive sectors; and (c) development and enforcement of a regulatory&#13;
environment that is private sector-friendly.&#13;
*    yThe Govemrnent will provide practical tecnical and financial assistance oa a&#13;
cost-sharing basis to private sector enterprises to jump-start their growth and&#13;
enhance their competitiveness.&#13;
10.   With these pnrnciples in mind, the Governmcnt has formulated a comprehensive&#13;
program of policies and procedural reforms to develop the export sector. The proposed&#13;
Export Development Project would assist us in imnplementng some of the most critical&#13;
components of the Government's Export Developrnent Program.&#13;
ImL   The Program&#13;
Il.   The  Government's Export Development Program  cornprises  a  set of&#13;
comprehensive and action oriented steps to be implemented during the next two to, three&#13;
ycan. The various components of this program have been designcd in close cooperation&#13;
with private business leaders and representatives of public sector agencies such as the&#13;
Mnistry of Finaance, the Central Bank of Jordan, the Miaistry of Trade &amp; Industry, and the&#13;
Investment Promotion Corporation. The program will work in tandem with the overall&#13;
economic reform activities. In specific, five broad areas relating to export promotion are&#13;
addressed:&#13;
(a)  Customs reforms&#13;
(b)  Liberalization of free trade zone regulations&#13;
(c)  Mobilization and enhancemcnt of invcstmcnts&#13;
(d)  Improvement of product standards and quality assurance&#13;
(e)  Increased access to term finance.&#13;
Customs Rcforms&#13;
12.   The present Customs Law does not provide clear guidelines regarding customs&#13;
declaration, valuation of goods, and the regulations eiiforcing penalty structures. It also&#13;
does not meet the WTO requiremeats for customs valuation. The government is in the&#13;
process of finalizing a new Customs Law that will be submitted to Parliament during 1996.&#13;
The new law woruld introduce the principle of self declaratior!, introduce clarity to&#13;
minimize the discretionary rreannent, update cnforcement mcasures, revise penalty&#13;
structures for violations, improve the definition of value to conform to GATTIWTO&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
requirernents foLlowing a transition period of refcrence-price based valuation.  A&#13;
reference-based price system would be adopted for problem conunodities while carrying&#13;
out preparatory work for introducing the GATT/WTO Valuation Code. The ncw law&#13;
would also establish  professional performance requirements for Customs personnel,&#13;
brokers and agerts.&#13;
13.   Reform of the customs rules and regulations is being undertaken with a view to&#13;
expediting and simplifying customs clearance for imports and expoits. The stream-lined&#13;
regulations will include: (a) a self-declaration system with only a random post-clearance&#13;
check of import declarations of up to 25 percent of all transactions; (b) setting of higher&#13;
processing targets to reduce clearance tirns; (c) reduction of physical inspection of&#13;
imports and exports to a maximum of 15 percent and 10 percent of all consignments&#13;
respectively; (d) exreading duty drawback and temporary cntry schemes to covcr&#13;
intelnediate producers; (e) replacing the cullelmany used incentive system of percenta-e of&#13;
fines for custorns officials with a more systematic merit-based reward program; and (i)&#13;
introducing a mechanism to appeal customs rulings.,&#13;
14.   The customs clearince procedures currently in force are not properly documented,&#13;
and are also not easily available to the concerned public. This causes unintended :d-hoc&#13;
and dissimilar handling of similar instances and introduces an element of discrct onary&#13;
treatment. In order to rectify this situarion, the government will devclop a detailed -nanual&#13;
of clearly designed operating procedures for customs operations that wil bc binding in all&#13;
rascs,  The manual win contain responsibilities of both customs clearance officers and&#13;
exporters and their agents. la order to implement the new customs regulations, an&#13;
intensive training program wil be carried out for customs ofEcials, broker-3 and agents.&#13;
The existing Custorns Training Center would be upgraded with qualified trainers, and an&#13;
Internal Affairs Deparument would be created within the customs organization to oversee&#13;
and implement a strict and transparent code of conduct and ethics.&#13;
15.     Finally, customs procedures would be automated in order to standardize&#13;
processing, facilitate enforcement and improve revenue collection.&#13;
Liberalizing the Free Trade Zone (FTZ) Regulations&#13;
16.   The currcnt legal framework governing the Free Trade Zones combiner  both&#13;
regulatory and management functions in the Free Zone Corporation (FZC). giving it&#13;
conflicting objectives.  To ease these conflicts, the government will reorganize and&#13;
reincorporate the FZC into a purely management entity for public sector free zones, while&#13;
transferring regulatory functions to a new entity under the Ministry of Finance. The&#13;
government also undertakes to introduce into Parliament during 1996, legislation to&#13;
amcnd the Free Zone law to allow private sector to establish and managc export oriented&#13;
and other special purpose free zones as well as allow private sector ownership of land and&#13;
factory premises at public sector free zones. The amended legislation would also thus&#13;
provide for dispute settement mechanisi, remnc-. a undue constraints rel-.1ing to&#13;
certificates of origin and minimurm export requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;

Mobilizing Investments&#13;
17.   The government has recemtly establishcd an autonornous Investment Promotion&#13;
Corporation (rPC) with a mandate to work on activities that would encouragc direct&#13;
foreign investments through joint ventures, partnerships and equity participation.  It is&#13;
expected that the IPC will be responsible for market promotion activities and act as a&#13;
bridge to foreign companies interested in business collaborations. The government plauns&#13;
to strengthen the PC's technical capabilities through recruitment and retention of highly&#13;
skilled staff  and provision of short-term expatriate experts in the area of intemational&#13;
marketing, financial management and quality control. A training needs analysis of the&#13;
current IPC staff will be conducted and appropriate training modules will be dcsigned to&#13;
upgrade their skills.&#13;
Instituting Quality and Standards Controls&#13;
18. . It is widely understood that one of the most serious constraints to incteasing&#13;
Jordan's exports is the weakness in product standards and quality control. Manufacturers&#13;
realize that exports, particularly to the European Cormunity and beyond, can only&#13;
flourish if Jordanian products meet their stringent quality standards of the re(eiving&#13;
mar'Kets. To address this issue, the government plans to substantially upgrade the t-pacity&#13;
and technical eiciency of the Jordanian Institution for Standards and Metrology.&#13;
Jpgrading will involve institution restructuring, standards development, enforccment of&#13;
legal meLrology, establishing  national systems for laboratory  accreditation, and&#13;
certificatioa of products and quality systems. We intend to enter into a twinning&#13;
arran-ement with an international merrology, standards testing and quality (MSTQ)&#13;
institution to provide technical support and help train the technical and managerial staff of&#13;
the institution.&#13;
19.    The government recognizes that, in tandem with the upgrading of the Irnstitution, it&#13;
needs to accelerate accreditation of Jordanian laboratories by internationally recognized&#13;
bodies. Plans are underway to accredit over 10 laboratories that are heavily invoived in&#13;
tcsting for exports. we are also establishing a calibration system in Jordan w a joint&#13;
operation between the Royal Scientific Society and the Royal Jordanian Air Force. Under&#13;
the program, we will also carry out a program to assist enterprises in preparing for&#13;
obtaining IS09000 certification. Moreover, in preparation for WTO mcmbership -we will&#13;
establish a WTO Fnquiry PoiLnt as a central repository of lordanian and inter-ational&#13;
standards.&#13;
20.    As a fiurther effort to help firms develop their ability to compcte in the international&#13;
market, we wiU establish an MSTQ extension service to provide finns with diagnostic&#13;
scrvices on product standards and quality issues. We will also institute an Export Support&#13;
Progsam (ESP), to be operated on a cost-sharing basis with new or existing exporter&#13;
firns. to provide direct assistance in strategic export planning, product design and&#13;
customization, international marketing techniques and market intclligence, quality&#13;
certifl:ation, and traiing. The ESP will also provide test market facilities and assist with&#13;
other start-up costs, such as for initial promotion, overseas visits to negotiate nmarketing&#13;

Enhancing the Availability of Term-Fiuance&#13;
21.   The resumption of economic growth and Jordan's strong ecoeoriic liberalization&#13;
program are expectcd to increase private investments in Jordan significantly; these new&#13;
invesTnents will need to be supported by an adequate supply of term resources. Whilc the&#13;
governmcnt's economic development strategy wilI address many of the constralins Llat&#13;
now inhibit the financial system from filly responding to the investment finance needs of&#13;
the real sectors, the impact of financial sector reforms will be felt only over the medium&#13;
term. Increasing the availability of medium to longer-term finance will enable the private&#13;
sector to undertake investments that will enable the economy to grow and create jobs.&#13;
22.   Jordan's credit market has traditionally lacked medium-to long-term finance to&#13;
support industry expansion. Such credit is only avalable for real estate and housing&#13;
construction. An important component of the Export Developmeal Program is to initiate&#13;
a scheme to make available medium- to long-term loans for plant and equipment,&#13;
permitting working capital, and investments in energy conservation and polution controL&#13;
The World Bank loan will be used to set up a line of credit to be channeled fi2c;n the&#13;
Central Bank of Jordan to private commercial banks for on-lending to new or existing&#13;
piva±c firms wanting to develop or expand productive capacity. This facility wil also help&#13;
Jordanian. commercial banks to stengthen their project appraisal and supervision&#13;
capabilities and make a substantial contnbution in enhancing the availability of medium- to&#13;
longer- term-finance to potential exporters.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
23.   Mr. President, the Export Development Program outlincd above will complcment&#13;
Iordan's Econiomic Reform Program which is being carried out wiLh &amp;iUll cooperati.n and&#13;
support of the World Bank and the Iaternational Monetary Fund. Jordan is sparng no&#13;
effort in getting organized and positioning itself to present one of the most invesmnent-&#13;
and trade-friendly environments in the Middle Est. Tlhe task is, by rLo means, n easy.&#13;
one. The transition towards a more private sector-lcd economy will require subsrantive&#13;
initial public sector investment to cover start-up costs. The Export Development Program&#13;
is also being supported by a number of other donors such as Germany, the European&#13;
Union, USAID and possibly the Government of Canada and the Arab Fund for Econornic&#13;
and Social Development. The World Bank's conLlibution toward its implementation will&#13;
be a key intervention not only as a direct investment, but also as a catalyst for attracting&#13;
other donors.&#13;
With my best personal regards.&#13;
Sincerely Yours,&#13;

THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN&#13;
EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Constraints to Supply of Medium- to Long- Term Finance&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Jordan's success in stabilizing its economy has led to a resumption of growth. Coupled with&#13;
deregulation of the real sectors, tariff reforms, reform of investment and tax regulations, and progress&#13;
in the peace process, investments in Jordan are poised for rapid growth and demand for long-term credit.&#13;
Increased demand for term resources has been confirmed through field interviews with private investment&#13;
banks. All of them confirmed that private firms are considering investments to exploit emerging&#13;
opportunities and they have received many requests for term credit to finance new investment. However,&#13;
they indicated that they are unable to fully satisfy the demand for long-term finance as they do not have&#13;
an adequate supply of long-term funds. For large firms with whom banks have a long-standing credit&#13;
relationship, banks indicated that they attempt to provide term finance by rolling over short term loans&#13;
and through syndicated loans. For other firms, the banks indicated that they entertain requests for&#13;
medium- to longer-term lending only when they have an identified source of term funds. For example,&#13;
a few years ago, investment banks extended medium-term finance under a line of credit from the Islamic&#13;
Development Bank, which provided term funds through the Government of Jordan. If such sources are&#13;
not available, banks indicated that they either direct their clients to the Industrial Development Bank or&#13;
lend only against credit guarantees from the Jordan Credit Guarantee Corporation or under refinance&#13;
arrangements with the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ). Some of the smaller banks also indicated that&#13;
greater availability of term resources would enable them to offer a fuller range of financial products and&#13;
assist them in competing with the bigger banks.&#13;
2.     These findings were confirmed by a recent survey of constraints faced by exporters.' The survey&#13;
identified limited availability of term resources as a major impediment to realizing full export potential.&#13;
Some of the main findings of the survey relating to access to preshipment export finance and investment&#13;
finance are:&#13;
*  Inadequate access to finance prevents firms from exploiting export opportunities. For example, a&#13;
manufacturer with a good export track record and export market prospects could not exploit the&#13;
demand because he did not have access to preshipment and medium-term finance.&#13;
*  Many exporters are interested in securing foreign currency loans to finance export production.&#13;
Banks, despite having large sums of short-term foreign currency deposits, were reluctant to satisfy&#13;
this requirement because the need to obtain prior CBJ approval on a case-by-case basis makes such&#13;
lending cumbersome (only very recently CBJ has announced measures to facilitate bank lending in&#13;
foreign currency).&#13;
The project preparation mission conducted formal interviews, using a standard questionnaire with 28&#13;
current and potential exporters. The survey results are presented in "Export Constraints Faced by&#13;
Jordanian Enterprises--A Survey of Jordanian Firms, " Rhee and Katterbach, World Bank, December 1994.&#13;
In addition, interviews were conducted with over 100 other small-and medium-size firms and 15 banks&#13;
during project preparation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 2 of 9&#13;
* Most firms have recently invested in new machinery. Only a small number financed them through&#13;
medium- and longer-term loans, while most relied on self-financing. Five firms indicated that they&#13;
had enough demand to justify fresh investments in plant and machinery of around JD 300,000 each.&#13;
As they would not be able to access term finance, they would postpone these investments until they&#13;
accumulated sufficient internally-generated funds.&#13;
* Most firms indicated that CBJ's refinance scheme for term loans was not easily accessible due to&#13;
limited information about the scheme, restrictive eligibility criteria, and slow processing of&#13;
applications, as each request requires a detailed analysis by CBJ in addition to appraisal by the&#13;
Industrial Development Bank which implements the refinance scheme.&#13;
3.     Thus, particularly small- and medium-firms undertake fresh investments only when they have&#13;
accumulated enough internally generated funds. As a result, productive investments cannot occur quickly&#13;
and at the right time to exploit market opportunities. Financing the anticipated growth in investments in&#13;
the productive sectors of the economy will be a major challenge in the next few years. Systematic efforts&#13;
will be required to improve the performance of the financial system in mobilizing and intermediating&#13;
long-term savings. The Jordan Country Economic Memorandum (Report No. 12645-JO) provides a&#13;
comprehensive review of financial sector constraints and their impact on financing longer-term&#13;
investments in the productive sectors.  The next sections summarize projections of investment&#13;
requirements and the main issues in increasing the supply of term resources through the financial system.&#13;
Investment Requirement&#13;
4.     Deregulation of the real sectors such as telecommunications, agriculture, and  power have&#13;
increased opportunities for private investments and will raise the demand for term resources. The impact&#13;
of these developments is already being felt. In 1994, 123 projects with an aggregate investment of JD&#13;
257 million were approved by the Investment Promotion Department of the Ministry of Industry and&#13;
Trade. The amount was nearly double that approved in 1992. Annual imports of electrical and non-&#13;
electrical machinery increased from JD 150 million in 1990 to more than JD 360 million in 1994.&#13;
Progress in the regional peace process and prospects for closer cooperation with EU are enhancing&#13;
Jordan's attractiveness as a location for export-oriented production facilities.  Furthermore, tariff,&#13;
investment, and tax reforms supported by the Economic Reform and Development Loan (ERDL),&#13;
approved in September 1995, will establish the framework for increased competition; improved access&#13;
to international markets under the proposed exporter support program (Figure 1 in the main text) will also&#13;
create more demand for plant and machinery.&#13;
5.     Over the next five years (1995-2000), gross fixed investment is projected to grow at a rate of 27&#13;
percent. This would require a total investment of JD8.6 billion (US$12 billion equivalent). Out of this&#13;
amount, JD2.6 billion (US$3.6 billion) would be required for machinery and equipment. It is unlikely&#13;
that Jordanian economy will be able to finance such an investment from internal sources. As the access&#13;
to international capital markets will expand only gradually, a major part of the financing requirement will&#13;
need to be funded from multilateral and bilateral sources. The project would finance a small part of this&#13;
requirement and enable the Jordanian private sector to undertake investment projects which will contribute&#13;
to economic growth of the country and generate much needed foreign exchange.&#13;
Constraints to Supply of Medium- to Long-Term Finance&#13;
6.     A wide variety of institutions intermediate savings and lending in Jordan. The main financial&#13;
institutions are the commercial and investment banks, specialized credit institutions, the Amman Financial&#13;
Market (AFM), pensions funds, insurance companies, and an investment company. While the financial&#13;
system has a variety of institutional players with a well developed banking system, ,t is not sufficiently&#13;
flexible and efficient to support a competitive trade and investment regime. Institutional, policy and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 3 of 9&#13;
regulatory rigidities have caused segmentation, muted competition, and thwarted efficient intermediation,&#13;
leading to a suboptimal pattern of savings mobilization and allocation. As a result, sources of long-term&#13;
finance are limited and are not effectively channeled to financing investments in the productive sectors.&#13;
7.     The banking system--21 licensed commercial and investment banks--is the largest component of&#13;
the financial system. In recent years considerable progress has been made in strengthening the banking&#13;
system. Commercial and investment banks are now required to follow the Basle norms for capital&#13;
adequacy and prudential lending guidelines conforming to international practices. According to CBJ,&#13;
most banks are now in compliance with the capital adequacy guidelines. Loan loss-provisioning has also&#13;
been increased and bad and doubtful loans have been fully provided for. The adoption of prudential&#13;
lending guidelines and enhanced powers of CBJ to intervene in case of incipient financial distress in&#13;
banks, coupled with improved on-site and off-site supervision, has caused a significant decline in bad&#13;
loans to less than 6 percent of outstanding loans.&#13;
8.     Even though the banking system is sound, mainly privately owned and effectively supervised, it&#13;
has had limited success in providing long-term credit to the economy. While loans to the private sector&#13;
account for nearly 90 percent of total outstanding bank credit, majority of the loans (approximately 70&#13;
percent in 1994) are for maturities of less than one year, with overdraft facilities accounting for nearly&#13;
35 percent of all loans. These loans are predominantly for short-term working capital purposes and&#13;
mainly to an established client base. On the remaining loans, repayment periods generally do not exceed&#13;
two years. Loans with maturities in excess of two years are generally extended on a syndicated basis and&#13;
restricted to large and we!l known companies. In some instances, longer-term loans have been provided&#13;
by rolling overdraft facilities. However, this arrangement is only made available to borrowers with which&#13;
the banks have long-standing credit relationships.&#13;
9.     The main reason for the limited supply of term resources from the banking system  is the&#13;
predominance of short-term deposit liabilities: deposits with maturities in excess of one year account for&#13;
a very small fraction of total deposit liabilities. Thus, fear of asset-liability mismatches prevents banks&#13;
from extending term loans. Privileges enjoyed by the specialized credit institutions and rigidities in the&#13;
capital markets have reduced incentives for commercial banks and investment banks to mobilize and&#13;
allocate long-term savings. Since banks cannot compete with specialized institutions that have access to&#13;
subsidized credit, they do not aggressively seek long-term savings. Instead they focus on providing short-&#13;
term working capital.&#13;
10.    Since 1989 CBJ has allowed the banking system to accept deposits denominated in foreign&#13;
currency. This has resulted in the healthy growth of banking system deposits denominated in foreign&#13;
currency. Such deposits accounted for approximately two-thirds of the increase in deposits between 1988&#13;
and 1993. Foreign currency deposits from both residents and non-residents now represent approximately&#13;
38 percent of banking system deposit liabilities. Until very recently, banks could not use these deposits&#13;
for extending loans to domestic firms. While this restriction has now been lifted and should encourage&#13;
banks to expand the choice of borrowing currencies they offer borrowers, it is unlikely to translate into&#13;
a significant increase in availability of term loans, as most of these deposits are short term.&#13;
11.    Until recently a number of other factors were also responsible for reducing the role of banks in&#13;
mobilizing and allocating long-term savings. The CBJ in the past used bank-by-bank credit ceilings as&#13;
an instrument of monetary control. While this prevented excessive credit expansion, it reduced incentives&#13;
for banks to compete for deposits and loans. The emergence of a liquid interbank market was also&#13;
thwarted because of reserve requirements on interbank deposits. The stunted development of the inter-&#13;
bank market in turn held back the growth of properly functioning money or bond markets, prevented&#13;
competition for funds between banks, and inhibited the smooth flow of funds between financial&#13;
institutions. Finally, in the past, CBJ involvement in individual bank credit decisions also reduced&#13;
incentives for banks to undertake term lending.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 4 of 9&#13;
12.    The CBJ has made a number of changes in rules and regulations aimed at improving incentives&#13;
and intermediation efficiency within the banking system without jeopardizing its integrity. All interest&#13;
rates have been deregulated and direct credit controls are being replaced by indirect monetary control.&#13;
Since 1993 the CBJ has been issuing certificates of deposit as part of its monetary management. In 1994&#13;
CBJ repealed regulations that restricted credit expansion to ten times the size of each bank's capital, and&#13;
in 1995 it eliminated credit/deposit ratios. These measures are expected to improve competition within&#13;
the banking system and enable smaller commercial and investment banks to compete more aggressively.&#13;
13.   Ideally, long-term investment funds should be provided from the capital markets. The Amman&#13;
Financial Market (AFM) is one of the largest stock exchanges in the region. About 150 companies are&#13;
quoted on the AFM with total market capitalization of JD2.267 million as at end 1992. The Arab Bank&#13;
accounts for nearly 40 percent of AFM's market capitalization and the five largest companies account for&#13;
nearly two-thirds of market capitalization. In the primary market between 1978-94, AFM supplied about&#13;
JD 1.5 billion of equity capital through primary market issues. However, its role as provider of capital&#13;
to the economy has been uneven. In 1981 new equity issues by new and existing companies represented&#13;
5 percent of GDP. By 1992 these had declined to 1.2 percent of GDP. During 1993 with the resumption&#13;
of economic growth new equity issues in the AFM aggregated about JD 230 million-about 6 percent of&#13;
GDP. About 60 percent of the newly raised capital went to existing companies quoted on AFM.&#13;
14.   While AFM has been at times an important source of long-term equity capital, its full potential&#13;
has not been achieved because of deficiencies in laws and regulations. The major constraints to AFM's&#13;
smooth functioning and its growth are: (i) requirements under the Companies Law that limit shareholdings&#13;
by each of the original promoters to less than 10 percent; (ii) determination of pricing of new equity&#13;
issues by the Government-appointed "Issuing Committee" instead of the market determining price of new&#13;
issues; (iii) cumbersome registration procedures including the small denomination of the face value of&#13;
shares; (iv) taxation of capitalized retained earnings; and (v) poor rules and regulations relating to&#13;
financial disclosure of companies and the activities of brokerage firms. These constraints have tended&#13;
to undermine public confidence.  They have also prevented the growth of the market makers,&#13;
underwriters, and brokers necessary to bring a larger number of companies to the market on a&#13;
competitive basis. Most firms other than large companies find the cost of raising equity capital through&#13;
AFM prohibitive.&#13;
15.    Bond markets in Jordan are underdeveloped and generally not accessible by the private sector&#13;
for a number of reasons. First, benchmarks for pricing bonds do not exist. Second, information on bond&#13;
markets is not easily available, making trading difficult. Third, the poor development of long-term&#13;
contractual savings institutions in Jordan has limited the demand for long-term debt instruments. Fourth,&#13;
the bond market is used to having government guarantees on bond issues. As a result, between 1988 and&#13;
1993, the private sector raised only JD 14 million through bond issues. In 1994 no private manufacturing&#13;
firm or investment bank managed to raise resources in the bond market.&#13;
16.   While transparent regulations and low transaction costs are necessary to motivate firms to access&#13;
capital markets, the existence of a strong supply side is equally important. In this context, contractual&#13;
savings institutions can play a catalytic role in developing vibrant capital markets. The institutional basis&#13;
for contractual savings is not fully developed in Jordan, primarily due to weak regulatory and institutional&#13;
framework that impedes the growth of private pension and mutual funds. As a result, individual savers&#13;
have limited institutional choices and limited financial products for storing their long-term savings.&#13;
17.   The growth of private contractual savings institutions has also been deterred by the existence of&#13;
the government-managed Social Security Corporation (SSC). The SSC manages the mandatory social&#13;
security contributions of employees and employers (15 percent of salaries have to be put towards social&#13;
security, with the employer contributing 10 percent and the employee, 5 percent). Total assets of SSC&#13;
are about US$800 million. Thle SSC has a substantial annual cash flow surplus and logically should be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 5 of 9&#13;
the source of long-term funds. However, the bulk of SSC's investments - over 50 percent - are in short-&#13;
term bank deposits. Loans account for another 23 percent of SSC's assets, with a significant portion of&#13;
these loans being to the G;overnment. Very few loans have been extended to purely private companies.&#13;
Equity investments are only about 13 percent of total assets and bond holdings are very small because&#13;
the Government requires SSC to keep a substantial portion of its funds as deposits with the Housing Bank&#13;
and give priority to purchase of short-term Government debt. As a result, SSC has been ineffective in&#13;
using its large annual flow of long-term funds to catalyze growth of equity and bond markets.&#13;
18.   One source of equity capital is the Jordan Investment Corporation (JIC) which is an investment&#13;
arm of the Government. Established in 1991 as a successor to the State Pension Fund, it is wholly owned&#13;
by the Government. It is the main institutional investor in the Jordanian economy and is funded&#13;
exclusively from Government equity contributions. At the end of 1993 JIC had invested in 43 companies&#13;
listed on the stock exchange that accounted for 60 percent of AFM's capitalization and JIC's own&#13;
investments accounted for 18 percent of AFM's capitalization. JIC is the majority shareholder in a&#13;
number of these companies. In addition, JIC has holdings in 28 companies not quoted on the stock&#13;
exchange. The total value of JIC investments as at end 1993 was JD 174 million. JIC has been an&#13;
important source of equity finance for Jordanian companies and has considerable influence and control&#13;
over publicly quoted companies. However, it is dependent on government financing and thus not in a&#13;
position to exercise independent corporate governance. Exclusive reliance on government funds has also&#13;
meant that it plays no active role in mobilizing and investing long-term savings from private individuals.&#13;
Thus, its impact on the growth of capital markets has been limited. In most instances its investments&#13;
have been in companies that are monopolies. Its role in promoting a competitive private sector has been&#13;
minimal. In addition to SSC and JIC there are private pension funds established by large companies and&#13;
banks. While not much is known about their investments their share in the financial system is very small.&#13;
19.   The insurance sector can also be a potential source of long-term funds. There are 17 insurance&#13;
companies in Jordan all of which are publicly quoted; however, the sector represents only 4 percent share&#13;
in the total assets of the financial system. The regulatory framework governing insurance companies is&#13;
not well defined and there are restrictions on entry of foreign insurance companies. As a result, the&#13;
insurance sector plays a very marginal role in the supply of long-term funds.&#13;
20.    The leasing industry in Jordan has not developed (there is only one leasing company, which has&#13;
had IFC involvement) for two main reasons: (i) restrictions on capacity to leverage; and (ii) deficiency&#13;
in collateral laws. Leasing companies are treated as non-financial companies. Hence their ability to raise&#13;
funds in the capital markets through bond issues is limited since they have to comply with leverage&#13;
restrictions of 1:1 set for companies that wish to issue corporate bonds. Furthermore, the Civil Code&#13;
does not provide adequate protection to leasing companies for using moveable property as the only&#13;
security in a lease transaction. The procedures for registering a lease interest or repossessing leased assets&#13;
is cumbersome.&#13;
21.   Another factor that has delayed the growth of long-term equity and debt markets is the privileged&#13;
position enjoyed by the four main specialized long-term financial institutions. These institutions were&#13;
established with a view to providing long-term loans for investment purposes. The Agricultural Credit&#13;
Corporation (ACC) finances the agricultural sector, the Cities and Villages Development Bank finances&#13;
municipal projects, the Industrial Development Bank (IDB) finances the industrial sector and the Housing&#13;
bank finances the real estate sector (it also has a commercial banking wing). As of the end of 1993, total&#13;
assets of the specialized financial institutions were JD 1,334 million, with loans and advances to the&#13;
private sector accounting for about 38 percent of total assets. Their share of credit extended by the&#13;
financial system was around 18 percent. During the past few years net new lending to the productive&#13;
sector has not been high-during 1994 net loan disbursements to the private sector were only JD 48&#13;
million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 6 of 9&#13;
22.   These banks have enjoyed special privileges, in the form of access to funds from CBJ, the&#13;
Government, and from international financial institutions (concessional funds). In most instances these&#13;
resources were made available at subsidized interest rates, enabling these banks to lend at interest rates&#13;
lower than what private financial institutions were willing to charge. For example, ACC's agriculture&#13;
lending has been at interest rates much lower than the going interest rates on loans from private banks.&#13;
In some cases, the cost of funds has been further subsidized through exemption from income taxes or&#13;
from import duties. For example, IDB pays neither income taxes nor customs duties. These privileges&#13;
are being removed however. As stated below (para. 25) and in the Government's Medium-Term&#13;
Framework Policy Matrix, during the calendar year 1996, the special privileges of IDB and the Housing&#13;
Bank are to be eliminated and they are to undergo CBJ supervision as other banks. Furthermore, the&#13;
Government will dispose of its minority equity holding (20 percent) in the Housing Bank.&#13;
23.    These special privileges have had a distortionary effect on the rest of the financial system&#13;
particularly on the availability of long-term credit for small and medium firms. Typically such long-term&#13;
credit institutions raise resources through bond issues. Resources raised through bond offerings are then&#13;
onlent to borrowers who, on their own, cannot directly access capital markets--generally small and&#13;
medium firms. However, in Jordan because of access to subsidized funds, these institutions lack the&#13;
incentives, skills or strong balance sheets to access capital markets. Of late, these institutions have also&#13;
faced a resource crunch. Because of monetary reasons and the need to curtail government spending,&#13;
access to funds from the CBJ and the Government has been reduced. Concessionary finance from&#13;
external sources is also becoming scarce. As a result, these institutions have been unable to fully service&#13;
the long-term financing needs of Jordanian firms. At the same time, development of bond markets is&#13;
delayed since bond issues by such institutions can often form the basis for development of a vibrant bond&#13;
market.&#13;
Govermnent's Strategy for Financial Deepening&#13;
24.   The Government of Jordan recognizes the policy and institutional constraints in the financial&#13;
system that have slowed financial deepening, and has included financial sector liberalization as a major&#13;
focus of its medium-term economic development strategy. With support from the Bank, the Govermment&#13;
plans to implement financial sector policy and institutional reforms to facilitate the growth of competitive&#13;
and well-regulated financial markets.  These reforms are outlined in the Government's Letter of&#13;
Development Policy for ERDL, and the related policy matrix is provided at the end of this Anmex.&#13;
25.   For the near future, the Government has set two main goals for deepening the financial sector:&#13;
(i) improve competition and efficiency in the banking system; and (ii) increase the mobilization and&#13;
intermediation of long-term savings by the capital markets, contractual savings institutions and the&#13;
insurance industry. The Government's specific policy objectives are:&#13;
* Further enhancement of competition in the banking system, for both deposits and loans, through&#13;
additional reform measures consisting of: (a) unification of reserve requirements for all banks so that&#13;
the trend towards universal banking can be strengthened (by end 1996, the difference between reserve&#13;
ratios applied to commercial banks and investment banks will be reduced to a maximum of 5&#13;
percent); (b) removal of reserve requirements on inter-bank deposits so that flow of resources&#13;
between banks is enhanced; (c) further strengthening of CBJ's off-site and on-site supervision&#13;
infrastructure; and (d) more transparent financial disclosure based on internationally accepted&#13;
accounting standards.&#13;
* Reform of specialized credit institutions through: (a) elimination of special privileges; (b) application&#13;
of a regulatory regime identical to that for private commercial and investment banks; (c) privatization&#13;
of the Industrial Development Bank; and sale of Government shares in the Housing Bank; and (d)&#13;
comprehensive restructuring of the Agriculture Credit Corporation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 7 of 9&#13;
*  Reform of capital markets through: (a) separation of operational and supervisory functions; (b)&#13;
installation of a modem trading, settlement, clearing and depository system; (c) adoption of fuller&#13;
financial disclosure guidelines based on internationally accepted accounting principles; and (d)&#13;
transparent regulation of brokers and underwriters.&#13;
*  Reform of the Companies Law so that (a) pricing of equity issues is determined by the market and&#13;
not by the "Issuing Committee"; (b) companies can issue unsecured bonds; (c) the amount of bonds&#13;
issued by companies can exceed their paid-up capital; and (d) share-holders can have 100 percent pre-&#13;
emptive rights.&#13;
*  Strengthening of the contractual savings institutions through: (a) reform of the insurance registration&#13;
allow new entry under a strengthened and independent regulatory body; (b) policy and regulatory&#13;
reforms that allow for private management of social security and pension schemes; and (c) amending&#13;
the Companies Law to permit establishment and supervision of private mutual funds.&#13;
26.    The long-term efforts discussed above, however, are not sufficient to deal with the immediate&#13;
need of firms for long-term funds, particularly in foreign exchange. The proposed credit line would&#13;
therefore serve as a useful vehicle to support the private sector in Jordan while the financial sector&#13;
reforms are being implemented and consolidated.&#13;

THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN&#13;
EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Terns and Conditions of the Line of Credit&#13;
Objective:   The objective of the credit line is to enable private firms invest in improving their&#13;
international competitiveness. The credit line would provide financially sound private commercial and&#13;
investment banks with access to term resources for financing medium and long-term investments of&#13;
private Jordanian firms. It would finance viable projects in all sectors other than real estate and housing&#13;
construction.&#13;
Borrower: The Government of Jordan&#13;
Loan Amount: US$ 40 million&#13;
Terms: The loan would consist of a single currency loan in US Dollars at the Bank's standard LIBOR-&#13;
based interest rate repayable over 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years. The last date for&#13;
commitment under the line of credit would be January 31, 1999.&#13;
Implementing Agency: The Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ), acting as the fiscal agent for the&#13;
Government of Jordan.&#13;
Beneficiaries: Private commercial and investment banks that meet the eligibility criteria established by&#13;
CBJ. The eligibility criteria are described on pages 4 and 5 of this Annex. During negotiations,&#13;
Government agreement was received on these criteria.&#13;
Onlending Terms to Participating Banks: Funds under the credit line would be onlent by CBJ to&#13;
participating banks (PBs) in US dollars or in Jordanian dinars (JD) at interest rates that, at a minimum,&#13;
cover the Government's cost of funds and reflect prevailing market conditions. Under current conditions,&#13;
the on-lending rate for US dollar loans would be LIBOR, plus a minimum spread of 100 basis points,&#13;
including 25 basis points for CBJ's administrative fee. For JD loans the on-lending rate would be the&#13;
Jordanian Treasury Bill' rate plus 50 basis points, of which 25 basis points would represent CBJ's&#13;
administrative fee.&#13;
The US dollar and JD on-lending rates would be reviewed every six months and, if necessary, new rates&#13;
reflecting the market conditions would be established; and the World Bank informed. The commnitment&#13;
charges paid by the Government to the World Bank would also be recovered from the PBs. The&#13;
repayment period for each loan extended to the PBs under the credit line would be the same as that on&#13;
the subloan extended by the PBs to private borrowers, subject to a maximum of seven years. Funds&#13;
would be onlent to PBs on a first-come first-served basis under subsidiary financing agreements executed&#13;
between the PBs and CBJ. Signing of subsidiary financing agreements between CBJ and at least two&#13;
prequalified banks to serve as PBs is a condition of effectiveness for the World Bank loan.&#13;
The 3-month Jordanian treasury bills are auctioned monthly by CBJ on behalf of the Government.&#13;
They have been issued since 1960s. The volumes issued in the last three years were JD1 billion each&#13;
in 1993 and 1994 and JD603 million in 1995. The large majority is purchased by private banks. In&#13;
January 1996, the interest rate on the treasury bills was 8.6%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
Purpose of Subloans: The PBs would use loans under the credit line to fund medium- and longer-term&#13;
loans (hereinafter referred to as subloans), sanctioned and disbursed by them to private Jordanian firms&#13;
(hereinafter referred to as subborrowers) for financing eligible activities (hereinafter referred to as sub-&#13;
projects). The eligibility criteria for subborrowers, subloans and subprojects are described in Appendix&#13;
2. At negotiations, agreement has been reached with the Government on the eligibility criteria. The&#13;
activities to be financed would broadly aim at implementing well conceived strategies for enhancing&#13;
competitiveness and, would include the following:&#13;
(a)    plant improvements, construction of factory premises, and acquisition of new plant and&#13;
machinery; and purchase of technical know-how and quality assurance equipment;&#13;
(b)    investments in energy conservation and pollution control equipment;&#13;
(c)    incremental permanent working capital needs arising as part of investments in new plant&#13;
and machinery; and&#13;
(d)    one-time cost of establishing marketing arrangements and providing training associated&#13;
with the new investments;&#13;
Onlending Terms for Subloans. The PBs would onlend funds to eligible enterprises in US dollars or&#13;
in Jordanian dinars. There would be no ceiling on the final interest rate or on the spread to be charged&#13;
by the PBs on individual subloans. These would be freely determined by the PBs, based on their analysis&#13;
of credit risk and on their relationships with prospective borrowers. However, the maximum repayment&#13;
period on any subloan would not exceed seven years, including a grace period of not more than three&#13;
years. The maximum amount of an individual subloan would be US$2 million. The first two subloans&#13;
extended by each PB under the line of credit would require prior approval of CBJ and the World Bank.&#13;
Thereafter, the PBs would send details about eligible subloans to CBJ for purposes of authorizing&#13;
disbursements only.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements. The CBJ will implement the credit line. For this purpose, CBJ has&#13;
established a two-person unit, supervised by the Executive Manager, External Debts and Agreements&#13;
Department. The specific responsibilities of this unit are to:&#13;
(a)    prequalify PBs and execute subsidiary financing agreements;&#13;
(b)    ensure that PBs meet the eligibility criteria;&#13;
(c)    approve the first two subloans extended by each PB, as well as obtain World Bank's&#13;
approval;&#13;
(d)    ensure on ex-post basis that each subloan (with the exception of the first two sub-loans&#13;
extended by each PB) complies with the eligibility criteria relating to subborrowers and&#13;
subprojects;&#13;
(e)    monitor and supervise utilization of the credit line, and keep the World Bank periodically&#13;
inforrned;&#13;
(f)    obtain periodic reports from the PBs on the subloans; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
(g)   ensure that disbursements under the credit line are in accordance with agreements reached&#13;
between the Government and the Bank on procurement and environmental assessments.&#13;
Environmental Impact. The PBs will ensure that each subproject will comply with the environmental&#13;
standards satisfactory to the Bank and with applicable laws and regulations of the Government relating&#13;
to health, safety and environmental pollution.&#13;
Procurement. Procurement of goods, services and works under the subloans would be carried out in&#13;
accordance with normal comnmercial practices of enterprises. These are acceptable to the Bank. The PBs&#13;
would maintain records of procurement procedures and methods used, summarizing offers and awards&#13;
for ex-post review by the Bank on a periodic basis.&#13;
Disbursements. Of the amounts disbursed by PBs under any subloan, subject to a maximum of US$2&#13;
million, the Bank loan would finance 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 90 percent of local&#13;
expenditures for goods and works, and 100 percent for consultants' services. Disbursements by PBs&#13;
would be against invoices. A Special Account would be opened by the Government of Jordan with CBJ,&#13;
with an authorized allocation of US$4 million. The Special Account would be replenished on a monthly&#13;
basis or when the balance is equal to 50 percent of the authorized allocation, whichever comes first.&#13;
Withdrawal applications would be supported by appropriate documentation, including a copy of the&#13;
monthly bank statements and their reconciliation with the Special Account transactions. Disbursements&#13;
can be made through direct payment or special commitments (subject to a minimum application size of&#13;
US$800,000) from the Bank.&#13;
Subloan Approvals and Free Linmits. It is expected that the average size of each subloan would be&#13;
US$500,000. As noted earlier, the first two subloans appraised by each PB under the line of credit would&#13;
be submitted to CBJ for prior approval. The CBJ would forward these to the World Bank for its&#13;
approval also. The request for approval would be accompanied by complete information on the subloans,&#13;
including a credit appraisal report prepared by the PB. Once CBJ and the World Bank have approved&#13;
the first two subloans, corresponding funds would be committed under the credit line. For subsequent&#13;
subloans, funds under the credit line would be committed to PBs as soon as they approve subloans that&#13;
meet the eligibility criteria. Details about subloans would be submitted by PBs to CBJ on a format&#13;
prescribed by CBJ. The CBJ would, in turn, keep the World Bank informed about the utilization of the&#13;
credit line on a monthly basis. Since the maximum amount of individual subloans is relatively small, no&#13;
separate free limits are being proposed.&#13;
Monitoring and Accounting. The CBJ would monitor implementation of the credit line. In January&#13;
1997 and 1999, Annual Reviews, and in January 1998, a Mid-Term Review would be held. In addition&#13;
to the monthly statements on the use of the credit line, CBJ would submit annual implementation progress&#13;
reports in November of each year, to the World Bank. The reports would follow a standardized format&#13;
that would be finalized during the project launch seminar. The reports would cover implementation&#13;
status; deviations, if any, from the Implementation Plan and reasons; problems and constraints, and the&#13;
corrective actions being taken; and updated disbursement and commitment tables. The CBJ would also&#13;
prepare a detailed mid-term report and submit it to the Bank by end November 1997 to serve as the basis&#13;
for the Mid-Term Review, and an Implementation Completion Report to the Bank within six months of&#13;
the Closing Date of the Bank loan. Progress on implementation of the credit line would be reviewed by&#13;
Bank supervision missions. The CBJ would ensure that the Special Account is audited by an independent&#13;
firm of auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audited accounts would be submitted to the Bank not later&#13;
than six months from the close of each fiscal year.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The principal objective of the Export
            Development Project is to support the Government's
            Export Sector Development Program, which aims at enhancing
            international competitiveness of Jordanian exports and
            increasing export revenues. The immediate objective of the
            project is to help private firms expand their productive
            capacity through a credit line for term lending. The major
            component of the project is a line of credit under which
            subloans will finance the following: 1) viable medium- and
            longer-term investments in plant and machinery in productive
            activities; 2) permanent working capital, marketing and
            training associated with new investments; and 3) investments
            in energy conservation and pollution control equipment.
