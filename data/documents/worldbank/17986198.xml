&#13;
&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the World&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh Kapur,&#13;
The World Bank: Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press,&#13;
1997. It is not a formal oral history, and it is not a systematic overview of the work of the&#13;
person interviewed. At times the authors discussed the planned publication itself and the&#13;
sources that should be consulted; at other times they talked about persons and&#13;
publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview tapes and transcripts begin and end&#13;
abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group Archives believes that this transcript may&#13;
be of interest to researchers and makes it available for public use.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                            2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I am sorry. You were saying about . . .&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: I was talking about the reform exercise after the Smithsonian, you know, in&#13;
the summer of 1971. There was a very strong feeling that, already at the preceding&#13;
annual meeting, that after all this was seen, there was a very strong feeling that the Fund&#13;
ought to engage in a reform exercise. The system ought to be reformed, and the natural&#13;
group that wanted to start to do this was the Group of Ten, but the Americans didn't want&#13;
that. The Executive Board was considered too low on the totem pole for this purpose.&#13;
&#13;
The Americans were trying for a different structure, but they wanted differences in two&#13;
respects: they didn't want it to be in the G-10, and they didn't want it to be too closely&#13;
related to the Fund. And they were toying with a group of eight or ten or twelve, which&#13;
would be the largest industrial countries plus Brazil, India, Australia, something like that.&#13;
And it took us half a year to persuade them that such a body would have no status, no&#13;
legitimacy. If Brazil were there, it could speak for Brazil but for nobody else, and that&#13;
the only possible solution was a body appointed by the Board of Governors, not co-opted&#13;
by the Americans, and then it had to reflect, if you want it about that size, it had to reflect&#13;
the Executive Board. But it was a major effort. We in the staff saw that right away, but&#13;
to persuade the Americans that's the only place they could go to.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the second thing the Americans wanted, they didn't want this thing to be serviced&#13;
by the IMF staff. And there is a wonderful anecdote of a meeting where [Paul]1 Volcker&#13;
came to explain this to the Managing Director, and Joe [Joseph] Gold, the general&#13;
counsel, and I were present. And Volcker said to the Managing Director, "There's one&#13;
thing I want you to understand. I don't want to be in the position where Gold tells me&#13;
what the law is and where Polak tells me what the economics is." And [Pierre-Paul]&#13;
Schweitzer gave the wonderful answer, "I'm sure it wouldn't be difficult to find two less&#13;
competent persons." And so you got this structure of a bureau which was set up, headed&#13;
by Jeremy Morse, who is an American, and a Japanese and two other people.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I see.&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: The Fund staff sort of half associated, and more or less parallel developments&#13;
in this unwieldy committee of 20â&#128;&#148;which meant a few hundred people--and the&#13;
Executive Board. In the end whatever little came out of this whole exercise was all done&#13;
in the Executive Board with the Fund's staff.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Now that of course had almost no externality as affected the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: No. [both speaking at once]&#13;

                                October 25, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: That was completely a Fund thing. But do the quota increases in the Fund,&#13;
like this time--I guess for the first time--because the size of increases of the Bank for GCI&#13;
[general capital increase] and the Fund, they wanted to--I think they were trying to&#13;
coordinate it so as not to hit the U.S. Congress at the same time.&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Oh, well, that's a parochial U.S. question, and that was really not observed at&#13;
any stage except in the final stages, in the deadlines, for instance.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I see.&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: So the Fund accommodated the Bank by putting its deadline so that it could&#13;
fall in the next U.S. fiscal year. But that's nothing between the two institutions, really.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Although now it seems as if it was more because the U.S. Congress, it seems&#13;
to have become more and more of aâ&#128;&#148;shrill, almost.&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Yes, the quota exercises both of the Fund and the Bank [inaudible] are always&#13;
extremely difficult in the U.S. Congress. You always get these questions: can do it just&#13;
before an election, or can you do two in the same year, and all that kind of stuff.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But otherwise, other major Fund things other than this thing of the G-5 and G-&#13;
7 where you see the battles between both institutions, one has not--in your memory--&#13;
things which have happened there have not really affected here.&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: No, of course they--my main subject is how they have moved to the middle of&#13;
19th Street and begun to invade each other's territory. And then you get these questions&#13;
of overlap jurisdiction and all these unpleasantnesses, sad to say.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right. John [Lewis] was saying he is chairing someâ&#128;&#148;in a more advisory&#13;
capacity--the North-South Institute in Canada, I guess, Ottawa, is doing a major study, a&#13;
fairly major study on the regional development banks, and, you know, because he was&#13;
involved in this study they thought he could be on the advisory board of that study. But it&#13;
is interesting when he went there, he was saying, how you see it sort of vis-a-vis the&#13;
RDBs vis-a-vis the World Bank, a sort of, you know, "big brother" effect. They're being&#13;
overwhelmed almost.&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: The regional banks by the World Bank? Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: A sort of larger, more . . .&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Because the thing I've been wondering about is that if you think the Fund and&#13;
the Bank are to some extent overlapping, how about that combination. That seems to be .&#13;
..&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Did that occupy--because you know now in the next few years, for example,&#13;
net transfers in Latin America by the IADB [Inter-American Development Bank] will&#13;
&#13;
                                   Jacques Polak&#13;
                           October 25, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
exceed those by the World Bank. I've seen those figures, and so it's not as [both speaking&#13;
at once] which mean that it's not as small relatively. Things have begun to change, but&#13;
one still has a perception of a much more overwhelming dominance in the larger sense of&#13;
the World Bank vis-Ã -vis these institutions. I was wondering, I mean, the Fund really&#13;
did--except for minor things about flows and so on--the regional development banks were&#13;
really not at all in your [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: No, not at all. No. We didn't look too much at the World Bank, let alone . . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Exactly. It's an interesting thing to pursue about why the Japanese--our sense&#13;
is that the Japanese have really, when it comes to pursuing their interests in these two&#13;
institutions and when that seems to at all conflict with bilateral relations with the U.S.,&#13;
the latter is far, far more important.&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Uh-huh. Yes.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: That's what the impression is. I don't know what the reality is.&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: The Japanese on this occasion for the first time in the Fund's process have&#13;
been pushing for a much larger quota. I was part of the Board at the previous exercise,&#13;
and I tried to goad my Japanese colleague in being a bit more aggressive, but he wasn't at&#13;
all. And on this occasion I guess the U.S. didn't mind.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Last time?&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: No, this time.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Oh, I see.&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: I don't know how they felt the time before, but this time I don't think this was--&#13;
the U.S. was difficult about the Japanese.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But you think that in fact the difficulties might come from the other G-5&#13;
members?&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Well, they were, but the Japanese six or seven years ago were still so timid&#13;
that they didn't even test the waters at that time. This time, of course, moving the&#13;
Japanese up meant moving the British in particular down; but this happened--supported, I&#13;
think, by the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But this next quota increase--the shares have already been put in place or that&#13;
is still to be worked out?&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Well, the current quota increase, yeah. This has been all negotiated.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Oh, it's already all set.&#13;
&#13;
                                   Jacques Polak&#13;
                           October 25, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Yeah, it's all set, and the Japanese have become, together with the Germans,&#13;
numbers two and three. That wasn't so very difficult, but the British and the French have&#13;
become four and five, equal amounts. That was very difficult because they both felt that&#13;
they were better than the other one.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Although don't the Italians have supposedly a GNP equal to that of the U.K.?&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: But it isn't only GNP. The trade of both Britain and France are still bigger&#13;
than that.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Oh, I see. So that is--I didn't realize that. What is the--how are the weights&#13;
worked out? I was just thinking . . .&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Oh, it's a very complicated thing. There was a formula agreed at Bretton&#13;
Woods which involved national income, exports, in addition exports as a percentage of&#13;
GNP, reserves, and variability of trade. The difference between the '34 exports and the&#13;
1938 exports [inaudible] and that formula has been refined as variability has been made&#13;
different. The weights have changed, and we now work with five formulas, toss them up&#13;
in the air and so on. But the most important thing is that in all these exercises the existing&#13;
quotas get quite a large weight in the new quotas. The new quotas--and this was done--&#13;
the only time when it was done wholly scientifically and the same for all countries was&#13;
the previous quota exercise. And there the formula was that the new quota is X times the&#13;
old quota plus Y times the calculated quota. And Y is so small that the movement, the&#13;
adjustment towards current reality is very small. And the British stayed on top even&#13;
though they are by no means--were by no means number two in the world anymore. And&#13;
the Japanese stayed down because of this slower [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Oh, I see. [inaudible] a minor quota exercise, you know, sort of triggered off&#13;
by looking at the figures of, say, China and India's per capita income. You see the world&#13;
development figures quoted, and everyone sort of quotes that, you know. It shows from&#13;
1965 to the past 25 years, per capita income of China has been increasing three times as&#13;
much as India's, and yet it shows India's per capita income greater than China's. And&#13;
now it's the other way around, about $10 more.&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Yes. Is China only slightly above India still?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Absolutely. It's 320 and 330.&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: I see.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And, you know, it seems rather odd, to put it mildly.&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Jacques Polak&#13;
                           October 25, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Of course, one can rationalize it by exchange rate fluctuations and this and that&#13;
but also you have a sense that there was a lot of arbitrariness when China joined to fixing&#13;
its base. But what Iâ&#128;&#153;ve beenâ&#128;&#148;you know, then you sort of got a little bit interested in why&#13;
the Bank has not got more into using PPP [purchasing power parity] figures, purchasing&#13;
power [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: But they have to some extent, or at least the average and things like that.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right, but I guess itâ&#128;&#153;s, of course, a statistical nightmareâ&#128;&#148;itâ&#128;&#153;s not a nightmare,&#13;
but itâ&#128;&#153;s a real [inaudible] There are lots of problems and so on. But if one does&#13;
recognize that per capita GNP figures are biased against poorer countries, that's a general&#13;
sense. Now we've just been wondering: if we're looking at the quotas in the Fund and&#13;
the shares in the Bank, to the extent that the rates of GNP matter, if the GNP were&#13;
computed in terms of PPP, how would the shares change?&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Yeah, well, the Fund must have studied this; and, again, in the previous quota&#13;
exercise the Fund runs through a big business as to whether it shouldn't use, I think,&#13;
purchasing power.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Oh, really?&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Oh, yes. I think it ran through a lot there. There is a large documentation on&#13;
it, mostly [inaudible] But of course the Fund has been biasing its--the quotas for the&#13;
LDCs [least developed countries] very much towards the LDCs, partly by these&#13;
[inaudible] formula because--well, the case of India is very interesting. India got a quota&#13;
at Bretton Woods; there was some calculation. Pakistan split off. Bangladesh split off&#13;
Pakistan. India kept the same quota. In terms of trade and GDP the investor countries&#13;
moved much more rapidly, whereas the formula continues to be a very slow adjustment.&#13;
So the Indian quota, while it's not based on PPP income is nevertheless really very high if&#13;
you accept this formula. But there were then proposals to adjust for all these things, and&#13;
they got nowhere.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And I guess here in the Bank smaller countries get [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Well, on the very small countries there are some funny adjustments as [both&#13;
speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: . . a fixed number of shares.&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: So all these very small islands get a little bit more [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: In a real sense, if you were to indeed use PPP, the actual changes would have&#13;
to . . .&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Well, it would--if you were to use PPP, yes; but if you were to use their&#13;
current incomes, that would lower it very much. And in fact the trouble is all the recent&#13;
&#13;
                                   Jacques Polak&#13;
                           October 25, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
quota exercise does, unless you do something to distort the calculations or make very&#13;
little adjustment, you always push the LDC vote down. Now, that's being partly&#13;
compensated by the number, the Africans and all that.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But even then, I mean . . .&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Well, the LDC vote has gone up, yes, in the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Not in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Oh, uh-huh, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: That's interesting to see that in fact the shares have gone down. This is&#13;
supposed to be more a development institution.&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Yes, yes, but of course a development institution presumes donors and donees,&#13;
and ultimately the donors want to have the say in what they give. And of course this has&#13;
been--there have been all these studies by various groups on the voting share and these&#13;
proposals that they should be 50/50, but there was a very interesting report by the&#13;
Commonwealth Secretariat, and it was done by--it may have been done by I.G.Patel, but&#13;
I'm not sure, or somebody else--arguing that the LDCs didn't have any benefit in raising&#13;
their voting strengths in the Fund and the Bank very much; look what they get out of the&#13;
U.N. where they have all these votes! And that would take, I mean, a little increase in&#13;
their voting strengths to ruin the 2 institutions and make them like the U.N.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Absolutely, I think that . . .&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: It wasnâ&#128;&#153;t Patel; it was somebody else who did the study [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: When do you think it was drafted?&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Oh, ten years ago, I would say. It was a Commonwealth study. It may have&#13;
been done by Rashpal(?)&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yes, I . . .&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: It may have been done by him.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Well, I guess the argument is more valid in IDA [International Development&#13;
Association] than IBRD [International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]&#13;
because there are no really donees in IBRD, strictly speaking.&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: It's because you pay market rates, yeah, but market rates are subsidies&#13;
compared to real market rates.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: It's really IDA where it's really . . .&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                        8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Otherwise--the one thing which we're trying to document is how much has the&#13;
U.S. really given to IBRD? If you really look at . .&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: [both speaking at once] of course . . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: . . and even if you take them by, you know, the volumes, the net volumes of&#13;
dollars of money raised in U.S. markets and also in terms of currency, [inaudible]&#13;
dollars, it's really, I mean, itâ&#128;&#153;s a pittance.&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Well, but the volume raised in the U.S. market is no cost to the United States&#13;
anyway. This is a market.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And even, you know, because in the early '70s they were . . .&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: The U.S. blocked.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Yeah, yeah. Well, this was the capital control in the United States. They&#13;
were worried about their balance of payments.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Exactly. But other than that the real cost of IBRD borrowing for the U.S. has&#13;
been virtually negligible--to the contributions which come, come primarily from the&#13;
capital, the paid in capital.&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Yeah. Well, this is very marginal.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Which is very marginal. And then if you take, if you impute a certain, if you&#13;
impute both the thing in procurement and the administration [inaudible] .&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Yes, but if you deduct procurement, that's again sort of [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: No, a sort of subtraction. Itâ&#128;&#153;s building in, say, 10 percent of total procurement&#13;
contracts, if you use . . .&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Yes. Oh, on the grounds that that's the, probably, the profit.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: At most. And sort of saying, you know, and say administrative expenses,&#13;
which is reallyâ&#128;&#148;they almost spend about a million dollars a year, which is not [both&#13;
speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Yes, that is--I mean, all this is sort of perverted market [both speaking at once]&#13;
When you have administrative expenses, you buy your coffee in the cafeteria.&#13;

KAPUR: Exactly. So you are getting a real thing. But one can either do it in terms of&#13;
just balance of payments, only to see the outflows. So all outflows in dollars, which&#13;
includes all IBRD net borrowing in dollars, and all inflows which come in through&#13;
procurements and administrative expenses. And even then you find that just on a solely&#13;
BOP [balance of payments] thing it's a net inflow, let alone, I mean, let's forget the actual&#13;
burden of shares. It's more I think to counter the perception, you know, especially in the&#13;
U.S. Congress, that they always give this huge amount of money, you know, that, look,&#13;
we are subsidizing these fat cats. But really, I mean, they're hardly putting up anything.&#13;
So I think it's more, hopefully, to look at the numbers.&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: I know.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: You're doing really not much more than almost anyone.&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But anyway, I'm sorry I got a bit carried off.&#13;
&#13;
POLAK: No, no, thatâ&#128;&#153;s fine. Well, the thing I wanted to come to talk about is Reagan . .&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In October 1991, Jacques J. Polak was
            interviewed by the Brookings Institution on behalf of the
            World Bank Group Archives oral history program by Devesh
            Kapur. Mr. Polak was a member of the Netherlands delegation
            at the International Monetary and Financial Conference of
            Bretton Woods in 1944. He worked for the International
            Monetary Fund (IMF) as an economist (1947-1979) and also as
            executive director (19981-1986). His transcript concerns the
            transfer of funds at development banks, the per capita
            income of India and China, and fund quota for least
            developed countries (LDC).
