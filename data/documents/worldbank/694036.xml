1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. COUNTRY ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SITUATION&#13;
1.1   Growth and development in Vietnam is in transition. Emerging from the Soviet&#13;
influence of the 1980's, Vietnam is changing from a centralized, largely controlled&#13;
socialist economy to one that is primarily market driven. Despite a period of successful&#13;
macroeconomic reforms, Vietnam remains a densely populated and poor country largely&#13;
dependent on natural resources for its economic well-being. Per capita income in&#13;
Vietnam, estimated at less than US$250 per annum, makes it one of the poorest countries&#13;
in the world. Rural poverty is estimated at 57 percent, more than double the 26 percent&#13;
rate for the urban areas. With about 80 percent of its approximate population of 75&#13;
million living in the rural areas, Vietnam is very dependent on its agriculture and natural&#13;
resources, which account for almost 30 percent of GDP and 60 percent of merchandise&#13;
exports. Approximately 73 percent of the total labor force is employed in the sector, and&#13;
this dependency and the high population pressure on scarce arable land are exerting&#13;
tremendous pressure on the country's natural resource base.&#13;
B. THE NATURAL RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENT SITUATION&#13;
1.2   One of Vietnam's primary natural resources is forests. Vietnam's natural forest&#13;
cover has declined from 67 percent of total land area in the 1940s to roughly 26 percent&#13;
(1993). The total area of natural forests has been declining at an estimated average rate of&#13;
350,000 hectare (ha) per year in recent years. Of the 19 million ha of land currently&#13;
classified as forest land, some 13 million ha is largely denuded former forests with low&#13;
agricultural productivity and is twice the area under existing cultivation. Only 1.0 million&#13;
ha contain medium to rich quality forests. These forests contain a wealth of plant species,&#13;
many of which are endemic, confined to small geographical ranges, and occur in low&#13;
numbers. Of the world's identified vascular plants, 10 percent are believed to be endemic&#13;
to Vietnam. These forests also contain the highest avian and primate diversity in&#13;
mainland Southeast Asia. Within the past two years, two new mammal species, the Vu&#13;
Quang Ox and the Giant Muntjac (a deer) were discovered in the upland forest of two&#13;
Central Highland provinces. Before these discoveries, only three other mammals had&#13;
been discovered in this century (Okapi in Zaire in 1906, Kouprey in Indochina in 1937,&#13;
and Chocoan Peccary in Paraguay in 1975). Many scientists believe that the potential for&#13;
more new discoveries remains high particularly in the border areas with Cambodia and&#13;
Lao PDR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
1.3    The leading cause of forest land degradation (shifting cultivation and arable land&#13;
expansion) are primarily attributable to population pressure'. Population growth has been&#13;
the highest in the north where the land per unit of rural population is 0.06 ha (compared&#13;
to the national average of 0.13 ha, which already ranks among the lowest in the world);&#13;
the natural population growth rate is about 3.0 percent per annum; and forest cover is&#13;
down to about 10 percent of the land area. High levels of under-employment, low per&#13;
capita income, and extreme difficulties in meeting basic needs have been the&#13;
consequence.  Since hill areas account for three-fourths of the country, cultivation&#13;
pressure has invariably risen in sloping areas, swidden/shifting agriculture is taking place&#13;
under substantially shortened fallow cycles, and erosion has increased substantially. The&#13;
"push" for migration from the north is therefore intensifying.&#13;
1.4    The Central Highlands, with Vietnam's lowest population density and last&#13;
remaining intact forests with the high concentrations of high-value biodiversity, are&#13;
presently experiencing population growth rates of between 6 to 8 percent per annum.&#13;
Population migration, which had hitherto been controlled, has been "spontaneous" since&#13;
1989. Without a concerted effort to address the situation, the migration push from the&#13;
north to these areas could result in severe environmental and social impacts. Not only&#13;
valuable biodiversity, but rare forest ecosystems, will be adversely affected: the carbon&#13;
sequestering effects of forests will be reduced, critical watersheds will be destroyed, and&#13;
local climatic changes, increasingly being attributed to the above degradation processes,&#13;
will intensify. Socially, serious disruption of ethnic minority livelihood could result.&#13;
C. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
1.5    The Government of Vietnam's (GOV's) concern and priority it assigned to&#13;
addressing natural resource and environmental degradation is expressed in a number of&#13;
documents, legislation and programs. The most important of which is the Vietnam&#13;
National Environmental Action Plan (VNNEAP), August 1995, which forms the basis for&#13;
Vietnam's current and future activities in environmental matters. One of the four priority&#13;
programs for natural resource management identified in the VNNEAP is upland forest&#13;
conservation and management for biodiversity and watershed protection. In addition, 4&#13;
other documents describe in greater detail GOV's strategy on forest protection and&#13;
biodiversity conservation - National Conservation Strategy (1984); Tropical Forestry&#13;
Action Plan (1991); the National Plan for Environment and Sustainable Development&#13;
(1991); and Vietnam Biodiversity Action Plan (1995). Within this framework a major&#13;
emphasis is on protection of viable examples of all major forest ecosystems within a&#13;
national system of protected areas (PAs) of national parks and nature reserves. Currently,&#13;
87 PAs covering some 1.08 million ha, have been designated. Government also&#13;
recognizes that in addition to protection measures, the sustainability of the PA system&#13;
Other key forest/forest land degradation sources include: (i) fuelwood consumption (widespread with&#13;
scattered tree cutting); (ii) commercial logging (significantly reduced since 1991 with introduction of&#13;
bans on export of roundwood and sawn timber from natural forests); and (c) fire damage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
requires addressing the reasons for dependence on forest encroachment--poverty and food&#13;
insecurity.&#13;
1.6   A number of laws and regulations on forest resource use and protection exist. The&#13;
most important is the 1991 Forestry Resource Protection and Development Act which&#13;
established three categories of forest land (i) protection forest (critical watersheds and&#13;
wetlands); (ii) special use forests (protected areas); and (iii) production forests. A&#13;
number of Implementing Decrees to strengthen forest protection including PAs were also&#13;
issued that, among other things, specify the management principles of each forest&#13;
category; the separation of forest protection from production; disengagement of the role&#13;
of forest enterprise; and allocation of forest land to local users. A noteworthy regulation&#13;
is Decree 327, issued in 1992, which sets out guidelines for a 10-year program aimed to&#13;
protect forests and develop denuded or barren forest lands. This program was launched in&#13;
1993 with a US$68 million equivalent budgeted in the first year and between US$ 50-60&#13;
million in subsequent years. Despite significant investments, the 327 Program has been&#13;
criticized for being too broad in scope thus reducing the likelihood of significant impacts&#13;
of any investments. To remedy this, Decree 556 was issued in 1995 to replace 327 and&#13;
target assistance more effectively and narrowly to activities directly related to PA,&#13;
protection forests, and buffer zones. A number of other socio-economic programs have&#13;
also been introduced since 1992. These include Program 120 for employment promotion&#13;
and programs to fight hunger and poverty including nutrition, literacy, and subsidies or&#13;
provision of basic goods. However, these have mainly bypassed the more remote&#13;
districts and have not been implemented in conjunction with forest protection.&#13;
1.7   Although the 327/556 programs have contributed to the overall strengthening of&#13;
forest protection, the current PA system still suffers from the following: (i) weak&#13;
enforcement; (ii) shortage of staff, (iii) inadequate investments, and (iv) lack of influence&#13;
on land use and people living in areas adjacent to the PAs (or buffer zone). Moreover, the&#13;
absence of a comprehensive plan (i.e., management plan) to guide protection,&#13;
management, and use of the PA has led to inefficient use of scarce human and financial&#13;
resources. Although national parks and some nature reserves have management plans,&#13;
they either are out-of-date or lack implementation detail and clarity. In addition,&#13;
population growth and in-migration into areas surrounding PAs have increased the&#13;
demands on limited resource base. Furthermore, the population in the buffer areas tends&#13;
to be extremely poor. Balancing PA conservation and the need to improve the livelihood&#13;
of the buffer zone population will require implementation of innovative conservation&#13;
strategies and closer collaboration between various levels of government and between&#13;
government staff and local people.&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
1.8   At the national level, the institutional framework for natural resource management&#13;
is in a state of transition as organizational structures are adapted or created to deal with&#13;
the demands for management of an increasingly market-oriented economy. The Ministry&#13;
of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) which has overall responsibility for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
natural resource sector was created in late 1995 by merging three former ministries&#13;
(Agriculture and Food Industries, Forestry, and Water Resources Development).&#13;
Although the structure has been established, the allocation of functions and&#13;
responsibilities between departments are still being formulated. The merging of three&#13;
sub-sectors, however, is expected to strengthen inter-linkages and multi-sector&#13;
approaches to resource management.&#13;
1.9   Within MARD, the Forest Protection Department (FPD) is responsible for all&#13;
protection activities, including those which take place in PAs. More specifically, FPD is&#13;
charged with monitoring enforcement of law, policies and regulations concerning forest&#13;
protection and management and transport of forest products. It also promotes public&#13;
awareness, undertakes management audits, and administers some 8,000 field staff&#13;
throughout the country. This structure is replicated throughout the country through&#13;
Forest Protection Branches (FPB) at provincial and district levels. Provincial Agriculture&#13;
and Forestry Departments and District Agriculture and Forestry Services provide service&#13;
functions as opposed to the control functions of FPB. PAFDs are now being restructured&#13;
as Provincial Agriculture and Rural Development Service (PARDS) combining&#13;
agriculture, forestry, inland fisheries, and water resource activities. PA management at&#13;
the field level is the responsibility of a Management Board headed by a Director which&#13;
reports to the FPB in the case of nature reserves and jointly to FPB and FPD for national&#13;
parks (since the national government provides some funding).  A multitude of&#13;
government agencies is responsible for activities in the buffer zone including PARDS,&#13;
provincial Transport and Communications Department, and Department of Land&#13;
Administration (DLA). Many of the PAs are adjacent to State Forest Enterprises (SFE)&#13;
which are responsible for management of all production forest land and which also&#13;
provide social service and community development functions. In this respect, SFEs&#13;
overlap in function with local governments. The activities of all these entities are&#13;
supposed to be coordinated by Provincial People's Committees. The effectiveness of&#13;
such coordination varies between provinces.&#13;
E. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.10  The importance of sustainable use of natural resources is one of the five key areas&#13;
of emphasis in IDA's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Vietnam discussed at the&#13;
Board November 21, 1995 and in the progress report discussed December 23, 1996. The&#13;
CAS also singled out deforestation as a critical issue for environmental action. Halting&#13;
natural resources degradation is also a key element of the Bank's rural development&#13;
strategy--Vision to Action: Rural Sector Strategy. Vietnam is one of 15 focal countries&#13;
for implementation of this rural action plan. IDA's involvement in this sector began in&#13;
1992 through the development of the environment report, "Environmental Program and&#13;
Policy Priorities for a Socialist Economy in Transition" (1995) and subsequent&#13;
development of the VNNEAP. One major outcome of the IDA environment sector work&#13;
is a recognition on the part of Government of the multidimensional and multisectoral&#13;
nature of natural resource and environment degradation. Government has also recognized&#13;
the need for outside assistance in addressing a number of difficult issues such as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
community participation in development; land settlement, tenure rights and reform; state&#13;
enterprise reform; and interagency coordination, all of which are critical issues in&#13;
addressing loss of natural forests. The Association is assisting with macroeconomic&#13;
management and external aid coordination and has carried out analytical work in support&#13;
of the reform program with studies not only on the environment but also poverty,&#13;
financial sector, transport, agricultural marketing and water resources management. It is&#13;
against this background that Government has requested Bank assistance in strengthening&#13;
current efforts in protecting forests. In addition, there are a number of small-scale pilot&#13;
initiatives in many parts of Vietnam, supported by bilateral donors and NGOs (especially&#13;
from Sweden, Germany, Denmark, Finland, UK, the Netherlands, Australia) from which&#13;
lessons for larger scale replication can be learned particularly with regard to participatory&#13;
community planning. IDA is in the best position to facilitate this process, which will&#13;
involve not only project initiatives but also the resolution of key policy issues that are&#13;
systemic in nature.&#13;
F. LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
1.11  Lessons from Recent IDA Involvement In Vietnam. Other than the Irrigation&#13;
Rehabilitation Project, which has been under implementation for less than two years,&#13;
there is practically no experience to draw on for lessons learned in the natural&#13;
resources/environment sector in Vietnam.   However, IDA  is involved in the&#13;
implementation of eleven projects and a Structural Adjustment Credit in Vietnam, most&#13;
of which are in the early stages of implementation. A second implementation review of&#13;
IDA operations, carried out in September 1996, found the portfolio is performing&#13;
satisfactorily considering the early stage of large donor project implementation. However,&#13;
some implementation problems have emerged that are generic in nature and could&#13;
become obstacles to implementation of the proposed project. Those that are relevant to&#13;
this project include inadequate local budgetary allocations, non-codified procurement&#13;
procedures, cumbersome fund flow arrangements, weak accounting and auditing&#13;
capacity, and absence of project monitoring. To overcome these obstacles, a 21-point&#13;
plan of action was agreed with Government which will be jointly monitored at regular&#13;
intervals. These actions include more training in procurement and project management&#13;
of project staff to be provided by the Resident Mission; issuance of implementing decrees&#13;
related to budgeting for ODA-linked projects to ensure adequate and timely provision of&#13;
counterpart funds; and regulations relating to national procurement procedures reflecting&#13;
international practices. In addition, the proposed project has included significant project&#13;
management technical assistance to assist in management, establishment of sound and&#13;
efficient financial management practices, and establishment of a project monitoring and&#13;
evaluation system.&#13;
1.12 Lessons From Bank/IDA Experience in Asia. The main lesson in PA&#13;
management in Asia (and elsewhere) is that traditional park management of strengthening&#13;
protection alone is insufficient and that there is a need to also address reasons for&#13;
encroachment. Lessons from other Bank projects being prepared and implemented in the&#13;
Asia region that integrate PA conservation with development (or ICDPs) are noteworthy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
and were incorporated into project design. One set of prerequisites for successful project&#13;
development concerns the need to have substantially developed a shared vision and&#13;
objectives and the selection of appropriate sites and beneficiaries. These prerequisites&#13;
have been established for the project through the VNNEAP process, IDA's policy and&#13;
project workshops for forestry and natural resource management, and the project&#13;
preparation process which has involved local governrnents from the start. Other lessons&#13;
to be noted are the need for involvement of the local community in project preparation&#13;
and implementation; for project preparation to be process driven; and for carrying out&#13;
indicative planning exercise during preparation as a means of testing and validating&#13;
project activities and approaches to community participation.&#13;
1.13  Lessons From Non-Bank ICDP Projects also indicate thatfirst, it is not enough&#13;
for programs aimed at communities living adjacent to the PAs to be predicated on the&#13;
assumption that improving incomes alone will relieve the pressure on conservation forest&#13;
incursion. They must include PA protection as an explicit objective and there must be&#13;
strong simultaneous demarcation and protection of the PA.  Such a multi-faceted&#13;
approach is needed because the self interest of buffer villagers must be taken into account&#13;
in the joint protection process. Those that have been deriving benefits from the forest on&#13;
their own account or on behalf of others (e.g., as agents of speculators and wildlife&#13;
traders) will not readily agree to discontinue their past behavior unless (i) they are&#13;
compensated for it or (ii) the cost of continuing their activities are made prohibitive.&#13;
Second, joint consultation and participation of the affected villagers is necessary for&#13;
successful joint forest protection and for sustainability in the protection process. In&#13;
Vietnam, pilot initiatives under the 327 Program in a number of provinces (e.g., Yok Don&#13;
National Park) have demonstrated the viability of allocating protection parcels at the&#13;
fringe of PAs to local people with priority being given to the poor and landless.&#13;
Assistance in longer term income improvement opportunities are given to secure their&#13;
participation in joint protection.&#13;
G. PROJECT PREPARATION PROCESS&#13;
1.14  Participatory Process.  Preparation for the project has emphasized client&#13;
ownership (particularly at the provincial and commune levels), local participation, and&#13;
public consultation.  A wide range of groups, organizations and individuals were&#13;
consulted by the preparation team  comprising   government staff and local and&#13;
international consultants. Four formal stakeholder workshops were held at various stages&#13;
of preparation to finalize site selection; develop a shared vision and common objectives;&#13;
and facilitate communications and exchange of views on project design and&#13;
implementation arrangements. Three formal meetings were held with non-governmental&#13;
organizations (NGOs) interested in the proposed project. Inputs from the grassroots level&#13;
and project beneficiaries were solicited through provincial-level representatives; through&#13;
participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and the indicative planning exercise carried out in two&#13;
project communes; and through field visits by the preparation team and World Bank&#13;
mission. Finally, numerous informal meetings were held to validate findings and&#13;
disseminate information (see Annex 1 for more detail).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
1.15  Site Selection Criteria.  In close consultation with provincial governments,&#13;
MARD selected project sites from a list of 12 high "A" priority PAs identified in the&#13;
Vietnam Biodiversity Action Plan. "A" level PAs are those containing biodiversity of&#13;
international significance that need immediate protection. From that list, final selection&#13;
was based on the following considerations: (i) high percentage of natural forests in the&#13;
buffer zones to apply different management strategies; (ii) variation of threats and&#13;
socioeconomic conditions to test different interventions; and (iii) strong interest and&#13;
commitment of local authorities and communities to the objectives of the proposed&#13;
project. As a result, two sites were selected, one in the Central Highlands where the&#13;
threats are still low and manageable but where ethnic minorities dominate (Chu Mom&#13;
Ray Nature Reserve or CMRNR) and the other in the lower central and southern&#13;
provinces where the threats are severe and complex and multiple provinces fringe the PA&#13;
[Cat Tien National Park (CTNP)].&#13;

2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT AREAS AND PARTICIPANTS&#13;
2.1    The project area includes Chu Mom Ray Nature Reserve (CMRNR), Cat Tien&#13;
National Park (CTNP), and a surrounding area of agricultural and forestry land (buffer&#13;
zone). Because an existing Dutch-funded project, Cat Tien National Park Conservation&#13;
Project (CTNPCP)2, is addressing the strengthening of the protected area management,&#13;
the project will support only buffer zone community development activities at CTNP,&#13;
closely coordinated with the CTNPCP. (Annex 2 summarizes the interventions being&#13;
applied by CTNPCP.) The project will support both PA protection and buffer zone&#13;
activities at CMRNR. Buffer zone has been defined as a continuous band of those&#13;
communes adjacent to the PAs of CTNP and CMRNR. The buffer zone also includes&#13;
additional contiguous communes within 3 kilometers (km) of the PA in which human&#13;
population may present an actual or potential threat to biodiversity conservation. This&#13;
definition was adopted because the commune is the smallest administrative unit in the&#13;
Vietnamese administrative system through which project activities can be effectively&#13;
managed.&#13;
2.2    CMRNR is located in Kon Tum Province and currently covers an area of&#13;
approximately 48,658 ha. It is proposed that the boundaries of CMRNR would expand&#13;
under the project to include a total area of 57,500 ha based on further surveys. CTNP is&#13;
comprised of 3 PAs in Dong Nai, Lam Dong and Binh Phuoc Provinces totaling 74,319&#13;
ha--Nam Cat Tien National Park, Cat Loc Nature Reserve, and Tay Cat Tien Nature&#13;
Reserve, respectively. These 3 PAs will be managed as one national park based on a&#13;
recent decision by GOV. The buffer zone for CTNP has a population of approximately&#13;
170,000 people in 30 communes and two district towns. Two communes in Dak Lak&#13;
Province are included in the CTNP project area as they are adjacent to Cat Loc Nature&#13;
Reserve. The buffer zone for CMRNR has approximately 20,000 people in 7 communes&#13;
and 1 district town. (Table 2.1). See Annex 3 for a list of project communes and&#13;
breakdown of ethnic groups.&#13;
2   CTNPCP is a US$6.9 million, five year project funded by the Netherlands Government and executed&#13;
by MARD with assistance from World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and CARE International.&#13;
Major focus is on strengthening park protection and working with villagers living inside but along the&#13;
boundary of the Park. It was recognized that CTNPCP could not cover the entire zone of influence on&#13;
the Park and that additional actions are urgently needed to fill this gap. Project preparation liaised&#13;
closely with CTNPCP to ensure complementary of activities that are mutually reinforcing. CTNPCP&#13;
will start implementation in mid-1997 and is expected to lay the ground work for commune action&#13;
plan formulation and delivery of buffer zone goods and services under the proposed project.&#13;

2.3    Many of the households in these communes are classified as poor and very poor&#13;
by Vietnamnese standards and most suffer from food insecurity during part of the year.&#13;
Many of these families depend on the extraction of forest products for at least part of the&#13;
year for subsistence consumption or to generate small amounts of cash income.&#13;
Officially, all land belongs to the State but can be managed, according to land use&#13;
classification, by registered land users following cadastral mapping and issuance of Land&#13;
Use Rights Certificate under the Land Law. In practice, land allocation is being&#13;
hampered by lack of official clarification of whether denuded forest land can be&#13;
converted to agriculture land use. Moreover, the rate of allocation of land has been slow&#13;
and most of the isolated communes in the project area do not have any official land tenure&#13;
for their inhabitants.&#13;
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.4    The overall objective of the project is to assist GOV to protect and manage natural&#13;
forests with high biodiversity. More specifically, the main development objectives of this&#13;
project are:&#13;
(a)  the effective protection of CTNP4 and effective protection and management of&#13;
CMRNR;&#13;
(b) the effective management of remaining natural forests outside the PAs but&#13;
within the buffer zone of CTNP and CMRNR;&#13;
3   During phase one revision of the management plan, the area of CMRNR would expand to&#13;
approximately 57,500 ha. Potential inclusion of another 85,000 ha is expected after additional&#13;
surveys are done in year 3.&#13;
4   Since PA management activities are being financed under a separate project, CTNPCP, and is not&#13;
under the direct influence of the proposed project, the development objective can only address&#13;
strengthening protection through buffer zone activities to alleviate pressure on the PA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
(c) the reduction in dependency on CTNP and CMRNR for subsistence and cash&#13;
income by improving the livelihood status of residents in the buffer zone; and&#13;
(d) the strengthening of capacity of government to effectively design, implement,&#13;
and monitor ICDPs.&#13;
2.5   Within this framework of development objectives, a matrix of performance&#13;
indicators has been agreed upon for the purposes of project monitoring and impact&#13;
evaluation (see Annex 4 for the full matrix). Agreement was obtained at negotiations that&#13;
a supplemental letter will be signed with the Development Credit Agreement indicating&#13;
the performance indicators which will be the basis for project monitoring. In terms of&#13;
impact indicators, the four most important are:&#13;
(a)  reduced unwarranted fires, illegal harvesting and transport of products and&#13;
wildlife from PAs and protection forests (buffer zone);&#13;
(b) reduced proportion of people in buffer zone communes facing food security&#13;
problems by 25 percent;&#13;
(c)  reduced area under "barren land" or denuded forest scrubland by 50 percent; and&#13;
(d) incorporation of design and approach pioneered by the project into government&#13;
policies and programs for forest protection.&#13;
While proxy measures of the above will be used, it should be noted that, unlike&#13;
conventional projects with clear component outputs that can be easily programmed before&#13;
project start-up, the participatory nature of the project means that the implementation&#13;
timeframe of most buffer zone activities cannot be easily predicted in advance.&#13;
Furthermore, a large number of impacts at the output level will not be amenable to&#13;
quantitative measurement.  Judgmental assessments (like the qualitative survey of&#13;
appropriate stakeholders) will, therefore, be equally important.&#13;
C. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.6   To achieve the above objectives, the project will help finance, over a period of&#13;
six years from 1998 to 2003, the following main components and subcomponents:&#13;
Component One: Protected Area Management for CMRNR (Baseline Costs US$&#13;
3.38 million)&#13;
2.7   This component will provide for:&#13;
revision of the existing Management Plan for CMRNR in two phases, including,&#13;
during the first phase, adjustment of boundaries to include an additional 8,800&#13;
ha of surrounding natural forest with high biodiversity value, definition of&#13;
management zones, formulation of management programs for each zone, visitor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
program, formulation of PA regulations, preparation of detailed cost estimates,&#13;
and the approval process for adoption of the revised Plan. The second phase&#13;
will assess the possibility of including an additional 85,000 ha to the west and&#13;
south based on results of additional surveys in year 3 of implementation and&#13;
revision of the management plan if needed. Assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations that the draft revised management plans for CMRNR and CTNP&#13;
would be submitted to IDA for review and comments by January 31, 1999.&#13;
implementation of the revised Management Plan including boundary&#13;
demarcation, introduction of PA management programs, supporting basic&#13;
infrastructure such as PA headquarters facilities (700 m 2), visitor center (200&#13;
m2), guardposts (7 x 100 m2) and control points (none exist at present), and&#13;
access trails to facilitate management and patrolling (48 km of tracks). Basic&#13;
equipment include office furnishing, communications equipment, vehicles and&#13;
motorcycles will be provided;&#13;
implementation of selected research studies and surveys, particularly&#13;
documenting the use of and value placed on biodiversity by ethnic minorities,&#13;
and collection of periodic  biophysical and socio-economic data and&#13;
development of baseline maps and permanent sampling transects for&#13;
management, monitoring and evaluation purposes.&#13;
* formulation and implementation of a public awareness campaign in the&#13;
CMRNR buffer zone to develop an appreciation of benefits and support for&#13;
conservation activities and promote interactions between PA administration and&#13;
buffer zone communities;&#13;
development of programmes to encourage and manage nature tourism (or eco-&#13;
tourism) in the PA and buffer zone as a means of raising awareness of&#13;
conservation benefits and generating revenues to local people and the PA. This&#13;
includes development of eco-tourism and marketing plan and provision of&#13;
training and basic equipment to participating villages. Care will be taken to&#13;
ensure that tourism activities do not compromise the biodiversity conservation&#13;
objective of the project;&#13;
training of PA staff including guards and management personnel to raise skill&#13;
levels and prepare staff to support the intensified conservation management and&#13;
visitor programmes. Training courses will be conducted in Vietnam and&#13;
selected senior staff will attend short courses at regional conservation&#13;
institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12-&#13;
Component Two: Buffer Zone Development (Baseline Costs US$21.55 million)&#13;
2.8   This component has been designed to reduce the incursion pressure on the PAs by&#13;
increasing incomes, providing land tenure, and enhancing the management and use of&#13;
existing natural forests in the buffer zone. This component will be implemented in a&#13;
similar manner in both CTNP and CMRNR and would adopt a participatory, process-&#13;
oriented approach to derive commune action plans (CAPs) for rural development in the&#13;
buffer communities. The CAP constitutes the focal point around which the following six&#13;
sub-components will be implemented.&#13;
Subcomponent (a): Community Development Planning.&#13;
2.9   The main objective of this subcomponent is to establish, for each project&#13;
commune, the capacity and conditions for implementing a participatory planning process&#13;
and prepare a CAP that will include an agreement between PA management and the&#13;
commune. It will support the application of participatory rural appraisal (PRA) methods&#13;
to identify essential social support services and associated activities such as land&#13;
allocation, access to essential health and education services, and rural development&#13;
interventions. These services should improve incomes and generate employment&#13;
opportunities, especially for the poorer households and ethnic minorities living adjoining&#13;
the PAs. To do this, the project will support the services of a Commune Advisory Group&#13;
(CAG) and the establishment of a Commune Working Group (CWG) at each&#13;
participating buffer zone commune. The CAG, in conjunction with relevant field staff,&#13;
will (i) carry-out the PRA; (ii) assess the feasibility of development needs identified by&#13;
the commune and provide more appropriate options for consideration; and (iii) assist the&#13;
CWG in monitoring the implementation of the CAP. The CWG will represent the&#13;
commune in (i) negotiations with the entities providing support services; (ii) finalizing a&#13;
conservation agreement based on the CAP; and (iii) monitoring CAP implementation.&#13;
2.10  Funding to implement the CAP will be conditional on commitments by the&#13;
community to undertake conservation measures, make counterpart contributions, ensure&#13;
maintenance of project investments, and not adversely affect the PA. More specifically, a&#13;
conservation agreement - to which the negotiated CAP and its obligations will be&#13;
attached - will be entered into with Chairperson of the CWG (on behalf of the community&#13;
as a whole), mass (grassroots) organizations, the Director of the adjacent PA, and&#13;
provincial Project Management Unit. Separate agreements would be signed between the&#13;
direct beneficiaries of an approved activity in the CAP and the chairperson of CWG to&#13;
ensure widespread public awareness of the conservation commitment.  Continued&#13;
disbursement under the CAP will be subject to annual review by the project, PA staff, and&#13;
CWG of the extent to which this agreement has been complied with. Annex 5 describes&#13;
this process in more detail.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
Subcomponent (b): LandAllocation&#13;
2.11  This subcomponent would be carried out in all project communes to help control&#13;
migration, increase social stability, improve access to institutional credit, and promote&#13;
sustainable land use. It will provide funds to expedite the land allocation process by&#13;
purchasing field equipment and training (i) to facilitate preparation of cadastre maps and&#13;
the issuance of land use certificates (the "red book"); and (ii) to undertake land use&#13;
planning at the commune level. The latter will derive participatory land use plans; enable&#13;
demarcation of boundaries for natural forests designated for protection purposes and&#13;
allocation of degraded forest areas for agroforestry or agricultural use; and facilitate the&#13;
preparation of forest protection contracts (para. 2.16 below). Priority will be assigned to&#13;
communes according to the threat they pose on the PA. Since this subcomponent is&#13;
closely linked to the community development planning process, proper sequencing of&#13;
land use planning is important. To ensure effective implementation of this sub-&#13;
component, each participating province has provided written confirmation that no new&#13;
economic zones will be established in the project area.&#13;
Subcomponent (c): Social Support Program&#13;
2.12  This subcomponent aims at improving productivity and sustainability of&#13;
agricultural and forestry systems, improving access to basic social infrastructure, and&#13;
increasing income and employment generating opportunities for the buffer zone&#13;
communities. The costs will be met from a Social Support Grant (SSG) allocated to each&#13;
project commune and calculated at $300 per eligible poor household whose income is&#13;
equivalent to less than 15 kilogram (kg) paddy per person per month. Specific social&#13;
support activities will be determined for each commune during the PRA and formulation&#13;
of CAP and may include activities such as (i) "food security" improvement, (ii) provision&#13;
of basic infrastructure (e.g. household water supply, buildings for schools and/or clinics,&#13;
intra-commune roads), and (iv) activities to strengthen local social and cultural&#13;
institutions. The project will support any activity identified by the community provided it&#13;
is consistent with the objectives of the project to improve the welfare of the target&#13;
population and reduce dependency on PA resources in a sustainable manner.&#13;
Beneficiaries and local governments are expected to pay a contribution in cash or in kind,&#13;
equivalent to a minimum of 10 percent of the value of each investment and agree to carry&#13;
out conservation activities agreed to in the CAP including a conservation agreement not&#13;
to exploit the core PA.&#13;
2.13  Guidelines for use and implementation of SSG are found in Annex 6. Assurances&#13;
were obtained at negotiations that (i) the SSG will operate in accordance with selection&#13;
criteria and guidelines specified in the Project Implementation Manual and acceptable to&#13;
IDA; (ii) each grant will be made on the basis of the agreed CAP and under a&#13;
conservation agreement between the CWG, Director of the PA, representatives of mass&#13;
organizations, and PPMU Manager on the basis of a model agreement acceptable to IDA;&#13;
and (iii) an evaluation of the implementation performance of the SSG and CAP will be&#13;
prepared as part of the mid-term review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
Subcomponent (d): Agricultural Support Services&#13;
2.14  This subcomponent aims at improving yields and diversifying farm incomes&#13;
through the strengthening extension services for agriculture and agroforestry; promoting&#13;
technology transfer from existing commodity development institutions; increasing public&#13;
awareness of the need for sustainable agriculture practices; and ensuring the availability&#13;
of necessary planting materials and inputs.&#13;
2.15  More specifically, agricultural extension support will focus on: (i) developing and&#13;
demonstrating relevant food cropping systems (e.g., high-yielding varieties of crops and&#13;
sloping agricultural land technology or SALT) rather than those for cash cropping -&#13;
which can be left to the relevant companies (e.g., for sugar cane, cotton, sericulture, and&#13;
rubber) that are already operating in the district; and (ii) in conjunction with grassroots&#13;
organizations and the private sector, providing logistical support in arranging as a group&#13;
for planting materials, inputs, appropriate husbandry techniques, institutional credit and&#13;
marketing in an adequate and timely manner. Support would be provided to strengthen&#13;
District Extension Center (DEC), to train Commune Extension Agents who will be&#13;
assisting the CAG, to promote use of Leading Farmer method of village-level extension,&#13;
and to facilitate the extension work. Agricultural credit support will primarily come&#13;
from VBA&amp;RD. No separate provision for credit will be made since VBA&amp;RD has&#13;
already provided a written assurance in a letter of agreement to provide commercial credit&#13;
to eligible borrowers in the project area. The project would provide one special mobile&#13;
banking unit per project district depending on projected credit demand to increase&#13;
effectiveness of VBA&amp;RD to provide support to remote areas under the project.&#13;
Subcomponent (e): Forest Management&#13;
2.16  This sub-component will fund two major activities addressing protection and&#13;
management of existing natural forests in the buffer zone. (i) Forest Protection will&#13;
improve the management and use of designated protection forests outside of the PA&#13;
identified as natural forests with high environmental value or needed by households&#13;
dependent on forest products for subsistence.  Such protection forests have been&#13;
distinguished from the more degraded forest land through the land allocation&#13;
subcomponent. Some 80,000 ha of such protection forests are expected to be allocated,&#13;
through the PRA process, to poor households for management under Forest Protection&#13;
Contracts supervised by the provincial FPD. Although the PRA exercise would develop&#13;
more detailed criteria for household selection, one major criteria would be to target the&#13;
below poverty households and indigenous ethnic minorities (if any). The contracts will&#13;
be issued by the Commune People's Committee to households for a period of not less&#13;
than 30 years but subject to review of fees after five years or cancellation for any breach&#13;
of contract provisions. Some limited harvesting of subsistence forest produce will be&#13;
permitted in exchange for assurances not to encroach on core PA and to protect against&#13;
fire and outside encroachers. These Forest Protection Contracts would be awarded to the&#13;
more vulnerable groups of residents bordering the PA. Funds will also be provided to&#13;
strengthen and expand the forest guard force.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
2.17  (ii) Study on Restructuring of State Forest Enterprises (SFE) is a pilot activity to&#13;
examine the feasibility of restructuring of three selected SFEs adjoining the PAs into&#13;
economically viable state-owned forest companies by introducing corporate type&#13;
management arrangements. This would facilitate implementation of Government's&#13;
policy to restructure State Enterprises and will improve management of remaining natural&#13;
forests outside the PA but under the jurisdiction of the SFEs. If, however, the studies find&#13;
that commercially-viable corporatization is not possible, they will propose phased&#13;
measures to dispose of the assets and labor force and identify social/economic&#13;
implications of such measures. Three SFEs have been selected based on the following&#13;
criteria: (a) the SFE should have more than 50 percent of natural forest suitable for&#13;
sustainable production management; (b) one from each project site; and (c) at least one&#13;
SFE under administration of MARD. The SFEs are La Nga Forestry Union in Dong Nai&#13;
Province (managed by MARD), Sa Thay SFE in Kon Tum Province, and Bu Dang in&#13;
Binh Phuoc Province. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that all pilot SFE studies&#13;
and a time-bound action plan for their implementation would be furnished to IDA for&#13;
review and comments by June 30, 1999.&#13;
Subcomponent (fJ: Rural Infrastructure&#13;
2.18  This sub-component will provide: (i) expansion of selected irrigation systems&#13;
through the rehabilitation of secondary canals and the completion of tertiary and on-farm&#13;
irrigation facilities (about 950 ha) and possible construction of new irrigation systems&#13;
(about 2100 ha) which meet project criteria for costs and benefits to increase food&#13;
production and food security; (ii) upgrading of some inter-commune and commune-&#13;
district roads (about 200 km) within the buffer zone to improve services to rural&#13;
communities and expand market opportunities; and (iii) improving road access to&#13;
headquarters of CTNP (6 km) and CMRNR (9 km) and CMRNR headquarters (at Ba&#13;
D'Goc) to Mo Ray commune to strengthen PA management. Technical assistance would&#13;
be provided to improve operation and maintenance of irrigation systems and to improve&#13;
cost recovery and water use efficiency. An indicative list is provided in the PIM.&#13;
Agreement was obtained at negotiations that final selection of (i) and (ii) would be based&#13;
on meeting social, environmental, financial and economic criteria and other guidelines set&#13;
forth in the PIM.  Preferential consideration would be given to areas that have&#13;
demonstrated commitment by local governments and communities to conservation&#13;
objectives of the project through the process of developing CAP and implementing&#13;
conservation agreements (paras. 2.9 - 2.10). Priority would also be given to schemes with&#13;
higher impact on poverty alleviation and to road segments that serve a high proportion of&#13;
ethnic minorities and a large total population. Agreement was obtained at negotiations&#13;
that disbursement for (i) and (ii) would be contingent on submission of list of works&#13;
based on criteria and guidelines specified in the PIM. This is expected to occur in year&#13;
two and beyond allowing time to implement the community development planning&#13;
process.&#13;

Component Three: Project Management and Institutional Development (Baseline&#13;
Costs US$3.90 million)&#13;
2.19  This component includes the following: (a) Project management will fund the&#13;
establishment of the institutional structures and management processes needed to&#13;
implement the project including monitoring and evaluation of project impacts, financial&#13;
management and audits, and supervision through provision of basic equipment, technical&#13;
assistance, and training.  (b) Institutional development will strengthen the institutional&#13;
capacity at all levels, particularly provincial, district, and community to (i) implement&#13;
project activities and (ii) sustain project interventions once implemented through&#13;
provision of technical assistance, formal and informal training, and on-the-job&#13;
experience. This will be accomplished through on-the-job technical assistance and&#13;
training from, to the extent possible, local institutes, private companies, extension&#13;
service, and mass organizations.&#13;

3. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
A. PROJECT COSTS&#13;
3.1    Total baseline costs have been estimated at US$28.84 million.   Physical&#13;
contingencies (US$0.93 million) and price contingencies (US$2.52 million or 9 percent&#13;
of baseline costs) increase total project costs to US$32.21 million. Total project costs&#13;
include a foreign exchange component of US$9.45 million (approximately 29 percent of&#13;
total costs). 52 percent of baseline costs are for CTNP buffer zone development and 36&#13;
percent (US$11.6) finance CMRNR and surrounding buffer zone. Of the latter, about 33&#13;
percent (US$3.4 million) will be utilized for nature reserve protection and the remainder&#13;
(approximately US$7.84 million) for buffer zone development. Approximately 13&#13;
percent of total project costs have been allocated for the Project Management and&#13;
Institutional Strengthening component.&#13;
3.2    Cost estimates are based on quantities derived from technical discussions during&#13;
preparation and appraisal missions and unit prices currently prevailing for similar&#13;
construction works and materials in project areas and from price quotations, whenever&#13;
possible, provided for equipment. Rates of inflation have been calculated using World&#13;
Bank projections of 2.3% in all project years for foreign exchange anld 6.0% in 1998-&#13;
2001 and 5.0% in 2002-2003 for Vietnamese Dong. Expected exchange rates have been&#13;
adjusted to account for differential foreign and local rates of inflation. Project costs are&#13;
shown in Table 3.1, with further details in Annex 7. Costs include taxes and customs&#13;
duties for equipment and taxes for civil works, which would be fully financed by the&#13;
Government. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Government would make&#13;
available to MARD a budget allocation, as part of counterpart funds, to cover the cost of&#13;
these customs duties and taxes.&#13;

B. FINANCING&#13;
3.3    An IDA credit of US$21.51 million equivalent would finance about 73 percent of&#13;
total project costs net of taxes and duties. IDA financing would cover foreign exchange&#13;
expenditures of approximately US$5.69 million, and about 79 percent of local costs.&#13;
Grant co-financing of approximately US$5.16 million equivalent is being provided by the&#13;
Government of the Netherlands for the PA Management component, the Community&#13;
Planning subcomponent, and the consulting services in the Project Management and&#13;
Institutional Development component. The Netherlands Grant will be managed by IDA&#13;
and executed by GOV following World Bank guidelines.&#13;

C. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.4    A national Project Management Unit (PMU) will have overall responsibility for&#13;
procurement but will delegate much of the procurement of the small scattered civil works,&#13;
goods, and services to the respective Provincial PMU (PPMU) in each of the five project&#13;
provinces (paras. 4.1-4.2). The PMU would be directly responsible for procurement of&#13;
all foreign and some national technical assistance, production of maps, vehicles and&#13;
major items of office equipment (e.g., computers and printers). The procurement&#13;
arrangements are summarized in Table 3.3 and reviewed below. Because many activities&#13;
to be financed can be finalized only during implementation, a detailed procurement plan&#13;
only for the first year is shown in Annex 8. However, agreement was obtained at&#13;
negotiations that an annual procurement plan for the next calendar year would be&#13;
furnished to IDA for review by August 31 of each year, beginning August 31, 1998.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that procurement of goods and services&#13;
financed under the project would be undertaken in accordance with Bank Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995 revised January and&#13;
August 1996) and Bank Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
World Bank Borrowers (January 1997), using Bank's standard documents. Agreement&#13;
was obtained at negotiations that a supplemental letter will be signed with the&#13;
Development Credit Agreement stating agreed revisions to the Borrower's local&#13;
procurement procedures (as indicated in Decree No. 43/CP dated July 16, 1996, Inter-&#13;
Ministcrial Circular No. 2 dated February 25, 1997 and Decree No. 93/CP dated August&#13;
23, 1997) required to meet IDA's procurement policy.&#13;

3.5   Works. Civil works of US$11.34 million would be required in the project,&#13;
comprising small-scale irrigation schemes and the upgrading of commune and district&#13;
roads, as well as infrastructure in CMRNR. These works are small and widely scattered&#13;
across five provinces and 40 communes/towns, and consequently, would not be suitable&#13;
for International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Contracts above US$50,000 equivalent per&#13;
contract with total about US$8.7 million would be procured according to National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to IDA. Contracts below US$50,000&#13;
equivalent per contract with total about US$2.0 million and buildings in CMRNR may be&#13;
procured using lump-sum fixed price contracts, according to simplified procurement&#13;
procedures for works, on the basis of quotations obtained from three qualified domestic&#13;
contractors. Works that meet the criteria set forth in Section 3.8 of the Guidelines, up to&#13;
an aggregate of US$200,000 equivalent may be procured by force account with IDA's&#13;
prior agreement.&#13;
3.6   All of the works in CMRNR, including trails and buildings, would be cofinanced&#13;
by the Netherlands Government and carried out in accordance with procedures acceptable&#13;
to IDA. Contracts below US$200,000 equivalent up to an aggregate of US$355,000&#13;
equivalent would be procured using lump-sum, fixed price contracts, according to&#13;
simplified procurement procedures for works, on the basis of quotations obtained from&#13;
three qualified domestic contractors. Contracts below US$50,000 equivalent, up to an&#13;
aggregate of US$90,000 equivalent, may be procured through direct contracting.&#13;
Patrolling trails for CMRNR may be procured through force account, up to an aggregate&#13;
of US$35,000 equivalent, with IDA's prior agreement.&#13;
3.7   Goods valued at US$4.32 million would be required for the project and comprises&#13;
vehicles (US$3.41) million, computers (US$0.12 million), office and field equipment&#13;
(US$0.28 million), and materials (US$0.51 million). Materials include agricultural&#13;
inputs, publications, and materials for those works to be undertaken by force account or&#13;
by communities under the SSG with IDA's prior agreement.  ICB procurement&#13;
procedures would apply to all vehicles including those to be financed by co-financier&#13;
with the exception of 2 four wheel drive vehicles needed for the PMU for project start-up.&#13;
These vehicles would be procured through the Interagency Procurement Service Office of&#13;
the United Nations. A margin of preference equal to 15 percent of th1e c.i.f. price of&#13;
imported goods or the actual customs duties and import taxes, whichever is less, will be&#13;
allowed to domestic manufacturers bidding under ICB procedures. All computers would&#13;
be procured through NCB (US$0.08 million IDA and US$0.03 million Netherlands)&#13;
except for 3 computers (US$0.01 million IDA) needed for project start-up which would&#13;
be procured through National Shopping procedures. Packaging contracts for office&#13;
furniture, office consumables, tools, agricultural inputs, and materials in many cases&#13;
would not be practical. All items or groups of items below US$80,000 equivalent per&#13;
contract up to US$100,000 aggregate for the IDA Credit would be procured by NCB.&#13;
National Shopping procedures would apply to all contracts for items or groups of items&#13;
with amounts up to US$50,000 equivalent per contract up to US$400,000 aggregate for&#13;
the IDA Credit and US$160,000 aggregate amount for the Netherlands Grant since small&#13;
quantities of diverse equipment and materials are required at each participating project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
commune. Contracts would be awarded on the basis of comparisons of price quotations&#13;
solicited from qualified suppliers in Vietnam, as described in Section 3.6 of the World&#13;
Bank Guidelines. Specialized items of proprietary nature such as books and computer&#13;
software may be procured using direct contacting, with IDA's prior approval, from&#13;
qualified suppliers up to an aggregate amount of US$200,000 for the IDA Credit and&#13;
US$30,000 for the Netherlands Grant.&#13;
3.8   Services, including training, technical assistance, and field activities (e.g.,&#13;
surveying, mapping, studies, and forest protection contracts) worth US$8.82 million&#13;
would be required for the project. Of this, approximately US$3.23 million of technical&#13;
assistance would be required. Consultants would be employed in accordance with Bank&#13;
Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers&#13;
(January 1997). Services for project management, biodiversity conservation of CMRNR,&#13;
buffer zone development, and project management and institutional development, to be&#13;
financed by the Netherlands Grant and estimated to cost US$4.04 million, would be&#13;
procured using quality- and cost-based selection. Grant-financed services for developing&#13;
and implementing Commune Action Plans, field surveys, specialized studies, and&#13;
monitoring and auditing and IDA-financed services for field surveys, land use planning,&#13;
and studies, estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent per contract with an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$0.75 million equivalent for the Grant and US$1.85 million for&#13;
the IDA Credit, would be procured using selection based on consultants' qualifications&#13;
because these are very small assignments for which the need for preparing and evaluating&#13;
competitive proposals are not justified.  Services for land allocation, community&#13;
extension, irrigation, facility design, and translation/interpretation estimated to cost less&#13;
than US$100,000 equivalent per contract with an aggregate amount of US$0.30 million&#13;
for the IDA Credit and US$0.05 million for the Netherlands Grant would be procured&#13;
using Individual Consultants method. Local training and overseas study tours (US$0.71&#13;
million) would be procured by procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
3.9   Social Support Investments. In the project buffer zone, investment expenditure&#13;
totaling US$3.23 million would finance small works and village development activities in&#13;
37 communes and three district towns over a four year project period. These activities,&#13;
identified in a Commune Action Plan and eligible for social support grant financing, will&#13;
be small sub-projects less than US$20,000. Social support grants will be disbursed on the&#13;
basis of contracts for activities identified in commune conservation agreements. Civil&#13;
works required estimated at US$2.83 million would be procured in accordance with&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA and with IDA's prior agreement: (a) under community&#13;
participation provisions by direct contracting with village communities; (b) by soliciting&#13;
quotations from at least three qualified contractors; or (c) through force account. Small&#13;
goods such as tools, agriculture inputs, publications, and supplies estimated at US$0.20&#13;
million would be procured through National Shopping procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
Services such as training or agriculture extension estimated at US$0.20 million would be&#13;
procured through direct contracting with IDA's prior agreement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
3.10  Other activities amnount to US$4.59 million and comprise incremental salaries and&#13;
allowances (US$0.67 million) and incremental operation and maintenance costs&#13;
(US$3.92 million). IDA would fund US$1.93 million of incremental operating expenses&#13;
over six years (financed on an declining basis, from 80 percent in project year 1 to 50&#13;
percent in project year 6) related to project staff travel and incremental allowances,&#13;
subsistence for field work, communications expenses, office consumable and expenses,&#13;
and operation and maintenance of project investments. These activities would be&#13;
procured according to the Borrower's procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
3.1  Review of Procurement. All contracts for goods would be grouped into bid&#13;
packages whenever possible to attract competition and permit bulk purchasing. The&#13;
Bank's standard bidding documents would be used, including standard evaluation form.&#13;
For the IDA Credit, prior review would be required for (a) all contracts awarded through&#13;
ICB; (b) first three contracts awarded through NCB regardless of value and subsequent&#13;
contracts for irrigation and road rehabilitation that exceed US$200,000; (c) the first&#13;
contract with a commune for each of five participating provinces regardless of value; and&#13;
(d) all contracts for consultants' services in excess of US$100,000 for firms, US$50,000&#13;
for individuals, and single source selection of consulting firms. For the Netherlands&#13;
Grant Agreement, prior review would be required for (a) all contracts for civil works that&#13;
exceed US$100,000; (b) all contract for goods that exceed US$200,000; and (c) all&#13;
contracts for consultants' services in excess of US$100,000 for firms, US$50,000 for&#13;
individuals, and single source selection of consulting firms. Prior review would apply to&#13;
about 80 percent of total consultants' services by value. For consultants' services, the&#13;
prior review will include single source selection of consulting firms, terms of reference,&#13;
short lists, letters of invitation, recommendations for award, and the final contract. These&#13;
arrangements would ensure prior review by IDA of about 45 percent of project&#13;
expenditures. The process-oriented nature of the project with its emphasis on community&#13;
programs managed and implemented by the communities is such that a higher level of&#13;
IDA review would not have a significant impact on procurement quality. Ex-post review&#13;
would be carried out on a sample basis of one out of five contracts for those contracts not&#13;
subject to prior review.&#13;
3.12  More intensive post-review would be carried out for SSG investments by MARD,&#13;
who will recruit an independent monitoring and auditing team (MAT), under terms of&#13;
reference satisfactory to IDA (para. 4.8). The MAT would carry-out an annual review of&#13;
procurement procedures, financial management, physical implementation, and impacts of&#13;
project activities. The MAT would review at least 20 percent of the SSG investments to&#13;
ensure consistency of the investments with the selection and eligibility criteria, agreed&#13;
procurement procedures, competitiveness of prices paid, and physical inspections of the&#13;
relevant items.&#13;
3.13 This will be the third project to be implemented by MARD. No major&#13;
procurement problems have been encountered by either the irrigation or agriculture&#13;
rehabilitation projects. MARD has been able to handle all procurement procedures&#13;
satisfactorily. However, given the fact that the recent IDA Country Portfolio&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
Performance Review identified procurement as one of several generic implementation&#13;
issues that needs improvement, training on IDA's procurement procedures will start after&#13;
appraisal with assistance from the Resident Mission and continue throughout initial years&#13;
of implementation.&#13;
D. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
3.14   The project is expected to be completed by December 31, 2003, six years after&#13;
project effectiveness. The closing date would be June 30, 2004, six months after the&#13;
expected completion. The estimated disbursement schedule is given in Annex 9 and is&#13;
more conservative than the standard disbursement profile (SDP) for IDA agriculture&#13;
projects in Vietnam, primarily as a function of the community planning and land&#13;
allocation processes that occur in PYs 1 and 2. The SDP for Vietnam is based on the&#13;
IDA's Vietnam agriculture lending portfolio as of June, 1995, and includes only the&#13;
Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (VN-PE-4834) and the Agricultural Rehabilitation&#13;
Project (VN-PE-4837). The expected disbursement schedule is consistent with the&#13;
Regional Agriculture sector SDP.&#13;
3.15  Funds from IDA would be disbursed as described in Table 3.4 below:&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
3.16  To facilitate project implementation, a Special Account will be opened in US&#13;
dollars in a bank acceptable to IDA with an authorized allocation of US$ 1.5 million and&#13;
an initial deposit of US$700,000 equal to about four months of estimated disbursements&#13;
until total disbursed and committed funds reach SDR1.0 million. The Special Account&#13;
will cover IDA's share of eligible expenses in both local and foreign currencies.&#13;
Applications for replenishment of the Special Account will be submitted monthly, or&#13;
whenever the account is drawn down by 20 percent, whichever comes first. Withdrawal&#13;
applications for payment to be made outside the Special Account would be accepted&#13;
provided that the amount requested is equivalent to at least 20 percent of the amount&#13;
advanced to the Special Account (or US$300,000). A second Special Account containing&#13;
Grant funds of the cofinancier will be established for disbursement of funids for activities-&#13;
financed under the Grant Agreement.&#13;
3.17 Full documentation will be required for services obtained from consulting firms&#13;
under contracts exceeding US$100,000, and in the case of individual consultants, for&#13;
contracts exceeding US$50,000; all goods procured under contract exceeding&#13;
US$200,000; and all works procured under contract exceeding US$200,000. All other&#13;
disbursements will be made against Statement of Expenditure (SOE) prepared by PMU.&#13;
The relevant documentation in support of SOE would be retained by PPMU and PMU,&#13;
and would be made available to the appropriate auditors and IDA review missions.&#13;
3.18  Fund Flow. In order to facilitate payments to be made by the five participating&#13;
provinces for small contracts, particularly to communities, each PPMU would open an&#13;
Advance Account in VND with the Provincial Treasury to receive IDA funds from the&#13;
Special Account. Once the initial deposit has been made into the Special Account, a&#13;
transfer would be made from the Special Account to the account at each PPMU's&#13;
Provincial Treasury Account, amounting to 90 days of expected expenditures based on an&#13;
approved annual workplan. PPMUs would replenish the Provincial Treasury Accounts&#13;
monthly from the Special Account by submitting fully documented requests to the PMU.&#13;
The latter will, in turn, replenish the Special Account from the IDA Credit. The PMU&#13;
will provide guidance to the PPMUs on disbursement as needed and ensure that proper&#13;
accounting records are maintained by each PPMU. The PMU will withdraw directly&#13;
from the Special Account for authorized expenditures incurred by the PMU. The IDA&#13;
Credit would be supplemented by counterpart resources derived from the Government's&#13;
own operating budget or from contributions from the communities.&#13;
E. ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS&#13;
3.19 The overall project account would be maintained by the PMU in MARD, and&#13;
separate project accounts for each province would be maintained by each PPMU. The&#13;
project accounts would reflect all financial transactions during project implementation&#13;
period for both IDA Credit and counterpart funding in two books, one by project&#13;
components, and one by expenditure categories. At negotiations, assurances were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
obtained that (i) the PMU and PPMU would each maintain separate accounts for project&#13;
funds; (ii) PPMUs would be responsible for filing monthly report on the project's account&#13;
to the PMU; (iii) Special Account and project accounts, including documentation for&#13;
SOEs, will be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to IDA, with the audit&#13;
including a separate opinion on the use of the SOEs and the status of audit compliance;&#13;
(iv) IDA funds can be used to finance expenditures incurred in arranging for the project&#13;
annual audit report; and (v) the detailed audit report would be submitted to IDA within&#13;
six months of the closing of the government's fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;

4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. PROJECT ORGANIZATION STRUCTURES AND RESPONSIBILITIES&#13;
4.1   MARD would be responsible for the overall management of the proposed project.&#13;
A Project Management Unit (PMU) would be established in MARD reporting to the&#13;
Chairman of the Project Steering Committee to handle day-to-day management of the&#13;
project. Tasks include facilitating coordination among the various implementing and&#13;
policy-making agencies, overseeing preparation and review of annual work plans and&#13;
budget requests submitted by the PPMUs and the PA Management Boards, preparing&#13;
overall progress and evaluation reports, monitoring and evaluation, recruitment of&#13;
international and some local consultants, procurement activities involving ICB, and&#13;
project-related training, financing, disbursement, accounts, and audits.&#13;
4.2   Provincial People's Committees of the five participating provinces would have&#13;
responsibility for project management at the provincial level. Separate Provincial Project&#13;
Management Units (PPMUs) would also be established under each Provincial People's&#13;
Committee. Each PPMU is responsible for coordinating activities between the PA and&#13;
buffer zone; supervising community planning process and implementation; preparing&#13;
annual work plan and budget for buffer zone activities since it involves several&#13;
implementing entities; procurement of works, goods, and services; and maintaining&#13;
project accounts and appropriate documentation to support SOEs; and organizing data&#13;
collection for project monitoring and evaluation. The PPMU of the four provinces&#13;
adjacent to CTNP would meet once at year with the Dutch-funded CTNPCP project&#13;
director to coordinate activities and ensure consistency in the annual planning exercise.&#13;
The PMU should delegate as much responsibility as feasible to the PPMUs including&#13;
procurement involving NCB and national shopping. The PMU and PPMU are temporary&#13;
entities and should dissolve at the end of the project.&#13;
4.3   Given that project implementation also relies on agencies outside of MARD, an&#13;
inter-ministerial Project Steering Committee (PSC) at the national level comprising&#13;
representatives of concerned MARD departments, other relevant government ministries&#13;
and organizations such as State Committee for Ethnic Minorities and Mountain Areas,&#13;
Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and Investment, State Bank of Vietnam,&#13;
General Department for Land Administration, and Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and&#13;
Rural Development (VBA&amp;RD) would be established under the chairmanship of MARD&#13;
to ensure coordination between ministries. The PSC will meet formally at least once a&#13;
year to set the principles and policies for the project; review and approve the consolidated&#13;
annual work plan and budget; and monitor project implementation progress. The PSC&#13;
would also facilitate coordination between provinces and adjudicate any disputes; this is&#13;
particularly important for CTNP which straddles 4 provinces.&#13;
4.4   Similarly, a Provincial Project Steering Committee (PPSC) will be established by&#13;
each Provincial People's Committee with representatives from implementing agencies&#13;
such as Forest Protection Branch, Provincial Agriculture and Rural Development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
Department (including irrigation service), Provincial Land Administration Department,&#13;
Provincial Planning and Investment Department, and a representative of the provincial&#13;
branch of VBA&amp;RD. The PPSC will meet at least twice a year to set policies for the&#13;
project at provincial level; approve annual work plans and budget requests prepared by&#13;
the PPMU; review monitoring and progress reports prepared by the PPMU; and&#13;
coordinate with relevant national ministries and departments. Terms of References&#13;
(TOR) for PSC, PPSC, PMU, and PPMU are described in Annex 10 and overall&#13;
organization of the project is shown in Annex 11. Establishment of PSC, PPSCs and&#13;
PMU, and PPMUs with managers in place would be conditions ofpro!ect effectiveness.&#13;
4.5   A Commune Working Group (CWG) is the key entity responsible for overseeing&#13;
the planning, implementation, and monitoring of community-based activities, particularly&#13;
the CAPs, at each participating commune. CWG would be formed during the first year of&#13;
implementation by the Commune People's Council to facilitate the community planning&#13;
process and subsequently assist the PPMU to manage and monitor community-based&#13;
project-related activities. The principle role is to ensure that all community stakeholders&#13;
are fully consulted in the planning process, and that the CAP represents the needs and&#13;
priorities of the community. The CAP is negotiated between the PPMU and the CWG&#13;
on behalf of the beneficiaries. Once agreed and submitted to the PPMU for further&#13;
processing, the CAP cannot be change without further discussions with the CWG. The&#13;
PPMU will ensure that the activities proposed are consistent with the selection criteria&#13;
and conservation objectives of the project and ensure the approved activities are included&#13;
in the annual work plan and budget. The CWG would be composed of five to ten&#13;
representatives of the commune, recommended by the PRA process and approved by the&#13;
Commune People's Council. The CWG would include representatives from the poorer&#13;
segments of the commune, especially (where present) all the indigenous ethnic minorities&#13;
in a commune and women's groups. The Chairperson of the CWG would be elected by&#13;
the members of the CWG. One member of the CWG would be authorized by the&#13;
Commune People's Council to operate a project bank account at the district treasury&#13;
office for limited project expenditures for which CWG is responsible. This structure aims&#13;
to promote and support local decision-making relating to local priorities within agreed&#13;
project guidelines.&#13;
4.6   Technical Assistance.  The project involves the introduction of many new&#13;
conservation techniques and processes that are still not very well known in Vietnam. To&#13;
ensure effective technology transfer, the project includes 313 person-months of short term&#13;
local consultants and 49 person months of short term foreign consultants, along with&#13;
three foreign resident advisors for 100 person months in the critical areas of protected&#13;
areas management, community development, and project management including&#13;
monitoring and evaluation. In addition, funds are provided to subcontract technical&#13;
studies, complete biophysical inventories, and undertake socio-economic baseline studies&#13;
to local research institutes as needed. Detailed breakdown of TA requirements is&#13;
described in Annex 12. The TA program is designed to train and build institutional&#13;
capacity at the start of the project, with a heavy emphasis on on-the-job training and use&#13;
of local experts and organizations, in order to ensure effective and sustainable transfer of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
technical and managerial expertise. The three long-term foreign TAs will transfer their&#13;
skills during their assignments to local counterparts who will then assume full&#13;
responsibility for implementation after year three.&#13;
B. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
4.7   Project activities are expected to be implemented simultaneously in each of the&#13;
five provinces. During project start-up, high priority will be given to training of PMU&#13;
and PPMU staff on procurement and administration procedures and timely recruitment of&#13;
project management-related consultants.  Other priorities include (i) contracting of&#13;
Community Advisory Groups to carry-out PRA and community planning studies in order&#13;
to form CWGs; (ii) training of land allocation teams in preparation for land use planning&#13;
and allocation; (iii) upgrading of access road to CTNP and from Sa Thay district to&#13;
CMRNR headquarters site; and (iv) contracting of PA Management Planning Team to&#13;
revise the CMRNR management plan in order to demarcate boundaries and determine&#13;
management prescriptions. An implementation schedule for all major project activities&#13;
is in Annex 13 including an outline of the PIM. The PIM provides more detailed&#13;
description of implementation arrangements and schedule by project component and&#13;
subcomponent. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the PIM would be applied&#13;
to all aspects of implementation, any revisions will require prior IDA review, and that the&#13;
PIM adopted by MARD would be a condition ofproject effectiveness.&#13;
C. MONITORING, EVALUATION, AND REPORTING ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
4.8   Periodic overall monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) would be carried out by the&#13;
PMU with assistance from international experts. The project has provided nine person&#13;
months for a M&amp;E specialist for this activity. Another 65 person months have been set&#13;
aside for contracting an independent local Monitoring and Auditing Team (MAT) to&#13;
provide an independent measurement and analysis of project and TA activities and all&#13;
aspects of performance on an annual basis (para.3.11). Progress will be measured against&#13;
the key performance indicators. On the basis of these key indicators, MARD would&#13;
develop and implement a monitoring, evaluation, and reporting system with assistance&#13;
from short-term M&amp;E expert. Agreement was obtained during negotiations that a project&#13;
monitoring and evaluation system satisfactory to IDA will be established by December&#13;
31, 1998.&#13;
4.9   Reporting. The PMU will be responsible for preparing progress reports using&#13;
information submitted by PPMU. Semi-annual reports will be submitted to IDA using&#13;
the key performance indicators as the basis for assessing implementation progress. These&#13;
reports will also (i) assess progress of all activities against agreed annual work plans and&#13;
targets; (ii) identify possible problems and recommend remedial action; and (iii) review&#13;
of procurement and disbursement activities. These reports will serve as a basis for Bank&#13;
supervision missions and for preparation of the next year's work plan and budget. To&#13;
ensure effective reporting, the following assurances were obtained at negotiations: (i)&#13;
progress reports will be furnished to IDA for review by July 31 and January 31 of each&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
year, beginning with July 31, 1998; and (ii) an annual work plan and financing plan for&#13;
project activities for the next calendar year will be furnished to IDA for review and&#13;
comments by August 31 of each year, beginning with August 31, 1998. A project&#13;
completion report would be prepared by GOV on the basis of Bank guidelines within six&#13;
months of the closing date of the credit.&#13;
4.10  Bank Supervision. The project will be supervised by IDA twice a year and&#13;
monitored regularly by the Resident Mission in Hanoi particularly with regard to&#13;
disbursement and procurement. Supervision will be more technically oriented with a core&#13;
team consisting of task team leader, social scientist, and rural development/institutions&#13;
specialist. As required the core team will be supplemented by other specialists, in such&#13;
areas as financial management, procurement, park management, farming systems&#13;
specialist, agro-marketing specialist, and management information systems. Whenever&#13;
possible, local professionals and non-governmental organizations will be recruited as&#13;
short-term consultants to assist IDA supervision missions. The expected timing and&#13;
expertise requirements are included in Annex 14. Supervision will be more intensive&#13;
during the first three years of implementation due to the complexity of the project and&#13;
limited experience in managing multilateral projects.&#13;
4.11   Mid-term Review. A joint mid-term review is planned by no later than March&#13;
31, 2001. To ensure effective preparation of the mid-term review, it was agreed at&#13;
negotiations that Government will prepare and submit to IDA by January 31, 2001 a mid-&#13;
term report summarizing the results of the M&amp;E, assessing progress achieved in project&#13;
implementation, and making recommendations to ensure efficient implementation of the&#13;
remainder of the project and achievement of project objectives.&#13;

5. PROJECT IMPACTS AND JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
5.1   The main benefits of the project would be (a) the protection of invaluable&#13;
biodiversity in the two PAs; (b) more effective management of natural forests in the&#13;
buffer zone; (c) improvements in the socio-economic well-being of buffer zone&#13;
communities; and (d) improvements in the institutional and administrative capacity of&#13;
GOV. Beyond providing for the conservation of biodiversity, the project would broaden&#13;
the focus of PA management planning, improve fire and poaching control, and improve&#13;
staff efficiency and effectiveness. It would provide a base for public support for the PAs&#13;
and would provide for technical review, administrative and financial services necessary&#13;
for quality control, accountability, integration, and overall timeliness of project&#13;
implementation. More importantly, the project would provide a new model for improved&#13;
PA management and establish more participatory organizational processes that could be&#13;
expanded to other ecologically significant areas in Vietnam.&#13;
5.2   Biodiversity Benefits. Although the value of the biodiversity in the PAs have&#13;
not been quantified, these two PAs have been ranked as containing biodiversity of global&#13;
importance through the Vietnam Biodiversity Action Plan exercise. CTNP harbors the&#13;
only known surviving population of Javan rhinoceros, Rhinoceros sondaicus, in mainland&#13;
Southeast Asia as well as several other internationally endangered species such as the&#13;
white-winged wood duck, Cairina scutulata and Siamese crocodile, Crocodylus&#13;
siamensis. It also supports some of the largest remaining examples of intact lowland&#13;
dipterocarp and lagerstroemia/dipterocarp forests present in Vietnam. Although less is&#13;
known about the biodiversity of CMRNR, preliminary surveys indicate that it supports a&#13;
significant number of species which are under threat. Thirty-eight percent (29 species) of&#13;
the Reserve's mammal fauna, for example, including the tiger Panthera tigris, douc langur&#13;
Pygathrix nemaeus, white-cheeked gibbon Hylobates leucogenys and Asian black bear&#13;
Ursus thinus, are considered to be either nationally or internationally endangered. CMRNR&#13;
is also a high priority site for development as possible Indochinese transfrontier PA with&#13;
Lao PDR and Cambodia which would increase the protection of wildlife that migrates&#13;
through the three countries.&#13;
5.3   Economic Benefits. Economic analysis was undertaken for the rural development&#13;
activities in the buffer zone. Because economic benefits are interdependent, conventional&#13;
economic rates of return calculations were made on an aggregated basis by (a) adding up&#13;
the incremental costs for infrastructure (irrigation and rural roads) and the "technology&#13;
transfer" investments on the farm (in food crops, agro-forestry, cash crops and livestock);&#13;
and (b) combining the production benefits of the subcomponents in such a way as to&#13;
ensure that there would be no "double counting". Production benefits from the irrigation&#13;
subcomponent can be analyzed separately (its economic rate of return or ERR is 15&#13;
percent). However, for the other production benefits (primarily rainfed yield and&#13;
cropping density improvements), only those from technology transfer through&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
extension/credit assistance are included. The production benefits and transport cost&#13;
savings associated with the road subcomponent were not included, while costs were.&#13;
Based on these conservative assumptions, the ERR for the combined inivestments is 13&#13;
percent (see Annex 15 for details and sensitivity analysis). This figure includes the&#13;
benefits from project investments that accrue outside the buffer zone communes. If the&#13;
non-buffer area benefits were to be left out, an ERR of eight percent would be the result.&#13;
If benefits were to be delayed by a year, the overall ERR would be nine percent. Given&#13;
the above, and because the project includes significant biodiversity benefits which cannot&#13;
be quantified, the overall ERR for the project is thus likely to have been understated.&#13;
5.4   The ERRs are calculated from financial farm models8 with adjustments for net&#13;
taxes and the shadow pricing of family labor at the market rate. The calculations exclude&#13;
the costs for technical assistance, land allocation, social support and project management&#13;
because these costs cover more than the buffer zone subcomponents and any attempt to&#13;
allocate them between buffer zone and non-buffer zone would be arbitrary. Excluded&#13;
benefits, which are difficult to quantify, are those arising from (a) more sustainable land&#13;
use practices and forest cover retention leading to decreased erosion/sedimentation and&#13;
greater water availability downstream, and (b) the spill-over effects from the reduction of&#13;
unemployment or underemployment due to increased income generation.&#13;
5.5   Financial Benefits. For a project which relies on improving the income and&#13;
livelihood status of buffer households to secure their joint cooperation in forest&#13;
protection, the financial rates of return (FRR) for these households will have to be high&#13;
enough to motivate active participation. For subsistence or food staple crops, the&#13;
incremental financial returns to the family labor effort is an important indicator of such an&#13;
incentive. The improved technologies to be introduced (for various systems of paddy&#13;
production and for maize and mung beans) will increase the returns per labor day from&#13;
levels close to the market unskilled wage rate (about Dong 11,000/day) in the "without&#13;
project" case to levels ranging from Dong 12,000 to 27,000/day in the "with project"&#13;
case.&#13;
5.6   For cash crops, incremental financial returns would vary according to the types of&#13;
buffer zone households, their farm endowment and location, and the market&#13;
opportunities. In accessible areas with relatively good basaltic soils in the CTNP buffer&#13;
zone (especially parts of Lam Dong and Dong Nai provinces), credit availability (from&#13;
VBA&amp;RD or a community revolving fund), together with project assistance in organizing&#13;
farmers could enable households to achieve incremental FRRs ranging from 20 to over 75&#13;
percent. This would cover rainfed farming of annual crops (ranging from improved rice,&#13;
maize, mulberry, or sericulture) and livestock to the introduction of irrigation to permit&#13;
the cultivation of high yielding variety rice, hybrid maize and coffee. In less well&#13;
endowed farms, extension service and subsistence credit assistance could help farmers&#13;
through critical cash-short months and thus enable them to at least grow enough food&#13;
8   Farm models can be found in the project file.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
(i.e., upland rice and maize) for subsistence before they can afford to produce high value&#13;
cash crops..&#13;
5.7   In the generally less accessible CMRNR buffer zone, where extensive barren land&#13;
exists, an extension package, which includes the planting of multi-purpose fodder trees&#13;
(to permit farmers to harvest leaves for livestock feeding in the dry season) would&#13;
significantly improve livestock productivity and farm income. In some areas close to&#13;
rubber plantations or sugar mills, opportunities exist for the introduction of raw material&#13;
cash crops like rubber and sugar, the FRR of which are approximately 14 percent and 20&#13;
percent respectively. In some degraded forest areas, agroforestry (with a FRR of about&#13;
13 percent) may be an option. For the many poor and often hungry households in the less&#13;
accessible forested buffer areas, employment opportunities provided under the forest&#13;
protection contracts (to manage and protect allocated parcels of protection forests) may&#13;
be the only source of cash income for these labor surplus, high poverty areas. In any&#13;
case, the raising of buffer zone incomes would mean that buffer households would be&#13;
more responsive to public awareness or extension programs and hence be more receptive&#13;
to a change in the lifestyle that accepts greater responsibility for maintenance of the&#13;
natural resources.&#13;
5.8   Fiscal Impact and Cost Recovery. The fiscal impact of the project on the&#13;
Government will be minimal. Of the total project cost (net of taxes) of US$ 29.5 million,&#13;
GOV's total contribution would only be about US$2.9 million. For example, GOV's net&#13;
of tax contribution for infrastructure investment (about US 0.6 million or about 7 % of&#13;
total project investment cost for both irrigation and roads) is small compared with the&#13;
total capital expenditure GOV has historically (1991-95) allocated for irrigation (US$448&#13;
million) and transport/communications (US$892 million). In any case, on-farm costs and&#13;
O&amp;M costs for tertiary irrigation facilities would be borne by the beneficiaries through&#13;
the contribution of their labor. GOV's contribution of nearly US$0.3 million for&#13;
agricultural support services cannot be considered to be inordinate. To operate and&#13;
maintain the US$3.1 million requirement for Social Support Grants under the project&#13;
(100 percent IDA financing), Government needs to commit only about US$ 0.3 million to&#13;
operate and maintain the social infrastructure to be developed under the project.&#13;
Communities are required to provide a minimum of 10 to 25 percent. contribution as well.&#13;
Finally, since GOV counterpart funding is also likely to be drawn from funding for&#13;
existing programs (Decree 327/556 programs or Government's Hunger Eradication and&#13;
Poverty Alleviation Program), the project can be considered as a means of ensuring that&#13;
expenditures for these programs are efficiently used. Nevertheless, assurances were&#13;
obtained at negotiations that a plan would be developed as part of the mid-term review on&#13;
post project financing of recurrent costs.&#13;
B. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
5.9   The project is classified as a category "B" project. Positive environmental&#13;
impacts are expected through improving management and protection of the PA and&#13;
surrounding forests and through the introduction of agricultural technology which will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
encourage sustainable agricultural activities in the buffer zone.  An Environmental&#13;
Review was carried out by the Environmental Protection Center, part of the Vietnam&#13;
Institute of Tropical Technology and Environmental Protection under the Ministry of&#13;
Science, Technology, and Environment. The Review considered both the potential&#13;
environmental impacts of activities and developments to be supported under the project&#13;
and the potential of existing or planned developments in the vicinity of the project areas&#13;
to adversely affect project sustainability and effectiveness. Annex 16 summarizes the&#13;
findings of the Environmental Review.&#13;
5.10  The Review concluded that the project will have overall positive impacts on the&#13;
environment and any potential negative impacts project components would be very&#13;
limited and confined to the small-scale rural infrastructure investments. However,&#13;
adequate safeguards have been taken through prescription of simple design guidelines&#13;
and incorporation of suitable safeguards in infrastructure construction specifications. The&#13;
necessary guidelines and safeguards have been incorporated in the Project&#13;
Implementation Manual. The only significant external developments with potential to&#13;
adversely affect the project are continued unsustainable logging operations in State Forest&#13;
Enterprises (SFE) adjacent to the PA. The project includes a pilot SFE restructuring&#13;
activity which is intended to provide a basis for improving the enivironmental and&#13;
financial performance of SFEs.&#13;
C. SOCIAL IMPACT&#13;
5.11  A social assessment was carried out as part of project preparation. The project is&#13;
expected to have significant positive social impacts particularly on some of the poorest&#13;
populations by ensuring a higher degree of food security, increasing household incomes,&#13;
improving rates of literacy, improving health and sanitation, creating employment&#13;
opportunities, and assisting indigenous ethnic groups in developing their specific cultural&#13;
identify. Project interventions that would improve the socio-economic and cultural&#13;
development of the people living in the buffer zone include: (i) lalid allocation and&#13;
securing land use rights; (ii) improved household food security; (iii) basic education and&#13;
health services; and (iv) maintenance and development of cultural tradition and values.&#13;
Social support requirements will be assessed in each commune and village during the first&#13;
two years of project implementation in full consultation with the communities using PRA&#13;
methods. Priority will be accorded to those communities which depend on access to the&#13;
resources of PA for subsistence and whose livelihood might be jeopardized by restricted&#13;
access to those resources.&#13;
5.12  Indigenous Peoples and Ethnic Minorities. The general project approach is&#13;
based on the informed participation of the local people themselves, and is thus adaptable&#13;
to the special and specific needs of the indigenous ethnic minorities residing in the&#13;
project area. In addition, numerous safeguards have been incorporated to ensure that the&#13;
indigenous ethnic groups of the area will get their share of development benefits, in a&#13;
manner appropriate and compatible with their social and cultural situation. The project is&#13;
expected to have a positive impact on ethnic minorities living in the project area by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
reducing the threats to and pressure on these groups and their land due to both&#13;
spontaneous and planned migration. However, to ensure that the culture and needs of the&#13;
ethnic minorities are recognized and addressed, a separate Ethnic Minorities Development&#13;
Plan (EMDP) was prepared by the Government and found to be in accordance with OD&#13;
4.20 on Indigenous Peoples. During negotiations, agreement was obtained that the&#13;
project would be implemented according to the provisions in the EMDP approved by&#13;
GOV.&#13;
5.13  Resettlement. No resettlement of households is envisaged under the project.&#13;
Every effort will be made to demarcate the boundaries of the PA without interfering with&#13;
existing habitations and land used for agriculture. This will be done by adjusting the&#13;
boundaries to exclude human settlements, and, where feasible, to create enclaves within&#13;
the PA. Under exceptional cases where human activities threaten biodiversity or where&#13;
forest protection would be otherwise impossible, resettlement may be unavoidable. The&#13;
number of people affected would only be known when actual boundary demarcation takes&#13;
place during the first year or so of project implementation. Therefore, to ensure that&#13;
people will be adequately compensated, a Policy Framework for Resettlement and&#13;
Rehabilitation of Project Affected Persons was prepared by the government and found to&#13;
be in accordance with OD 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement. The principle objective of&#13;
the Resettlement Policy Framework is to ensure that Project Affected Persons (PAPs), if&#13;
any, will be compensated for their losses and provided with rehabilitation measures to&#13;
assist them to improve their pre-Project living standards and income earning capacity.&#13;
The Framework specifies the principles and objectives, eligibility criteria of PAPs,&#13;
entitlements, legal and institutional framework, modes of compensation and&#13;
rehabilitation, process for peoples participation and grievance procedures that will guide&#13;
compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation of the PAPs. Agreement was obtained at&#13;
negotiations that if resettlement is unavoidable, it will be completed in accordance with&#13;
the Resettlement Policy Framework approved by GOV including detailed action plans to&#13;
be submitted to IDA for approval.&#13;
D. SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
5.14  Project sustainability will be enhanced by the following interventions:  (i)&#13;
development of institutional and human resource capacity to implement conservation&#13;
programs; (ii) development of ownership and commitment at commune and village to&#13;
project objective of protecting critical forest resources and biodiversity; and (iii)&#13;
development of incentives and alternative livelihood opportunities to reduce pressure on&#13;
the PA. Furthermore, as the fiscal impact on the project is not inordinate (para 5.8), post&#13;
project period sustainability is not expected to be a problem. The long-term sustainability&#13;
of CMRNR and CTNP will depend to a large extent on a shared responsibility in PA&#13;
conservation between MARD, provincial and local governments, and village&#13;
communities residing around the PAs. Therefore, participatory planning, including land&#13;
allocation and boundary demarcation, assuring appropriate market  incentives,&#13;
development and promotion of 'alternative livelihood opportunities, and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
empowerment of local communities, is critical. Such a participatory approach will also&#13;
serve to reduce the risk of choosing wrong investments under the project.&#13;
5.15   Sustainability will also depend on how effective is the design of the project and&#13;
how cost effectively can the project activities be implemented. Care has been taken in&#13;
designing the project to ensure that key ingredients of success has been incorporated (see&#13;
para 5.14 above). Duplication has been avoided wherever possible (e.g., no separate&#13;
investment/development support is being established for rubber, cotton or sericulture&#13;
where existing state enterprises or agencies already exist). On PA protection, particular&#13;
care has been taken not to over-invest, particularly given the limited absorptive capacity.&#13;
Overall costs are consistent with other such investments in Vietnam (e.g., Yok Don&#13;
National Park or Vu Quang National Park). Much of the costs are initial investments&#13;
needed to establish basic protection and management infrastructure and a monitoring and&#13;
evaluation system. Recurrent costs (mostly salary and routine operating expenses) to&#13;
maintain the level of management required should be easily met by the existing 327/556&#13;
program.&#13;
E. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
5.16  The project should be seen as an experiment being undertaken in very challenging&#13;
circumstances. Many of the project interventions are innovative and "pilot" in nature and&#13;
therefore could be considered highly risky. However, project activities were built upon&#13;
processes that have been demonstrated in other locations in Vietnam and elsewhere in the&#13;
region and tested in two project communes during the preparation process. The approach&#13;
also emphasized greater involvement of local communities and use of existing support&#13;
services and processes to deliver project goods and services. A high level of institutional&#13;
support will "pilot test" these measures and make any modifications needed to enhance&#13;
local effectiveness.&#13;
5.17  A  major risk is increasing population pressure due to spontaneous and&#13;
Government sponsored planned migration into the project area. Project activities have&#13;
taken measures to minimize unplanned migration through PA boundary demarcation,&#13;
land allocation in the buffer zone to secure land tenure, and better enforcement using joint&#13;
protection contracts as well as strengthening protection measures.  It has been&#13;
demonstrated elsewhere in Vietnam that allocation of secure long-term title to land can,&#13;
among other things, reduce the opportunity for in-migration. Although current GOV&#13;
policy favors planned migration as a means of ensuring orderly labor mobility and equal&#13;
access to economic opportunity, there is recognition of the need to limit migration into&#13;
the project buffer zone areas to ensure long-term sustainability of the PA. The provincial&#13;
governments have provided written assurances that no new Economic Zones will be&#13;
established in the project area.&#13;
5.18  Another risk is that, despite receiving project benefits, existing local communities&#13;
will fail to support the project's conservation objective, but will continue to press&#13;
demands for remaining forest resources in the PA and surrounding buffer zone. The main&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
aim of the buffer zone component is to reduce this pressure by introducing alternative&#13;
income-generating activities and to build support for the PA among local communities&#13;
and authorities. Access to project funds will be directly linked to cooperation and&#13;
compliance on the part of the beneficiaries, with the expectation that as some&#13;
communities begin to benefit from cooperation and participation, other will follow their&#13;
lead. The pace of implementation of the buffer zone component will therefore be set by&#13;
the communities and not "tied" to a predetermined implementation schedule.&#13;
5.19  Many project interventions are inter-dependent. Inadequate coordination and&#13;
ineffective sequencing of key activities is, therefore, an important risk for project success.&#13;
Such a risk is critical for the effective preparation of the multiple-step Commune Action&#13;
Plan (which requires timely coordination among PPMU, CAG and CWG) and the&#13;
effective transfer of appropriate technology packages (which requires timely coordination&#13;
among VBA&amp;RD, DEC and the private sector  for extension, input supply and&#13;
marketing). A significant amount of technical assistance is being provided to ensuring&#13;
timely effective planning and training for these activities and thus should minimize this&#13;
risk.&#13;

THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM&#13;
Forest Protection and Rural Development Project&#13;
Participatory Preparation Process&#13;
1.     Detailed preparation of the project was carried out by a team of local and international&#13;
consultants under the supervision of a National Project Steering Committee and National Project&#13;
Coordinator (NPC) from MARD in three stages:&#13;
*   Stage I (October - December 1995) focused on information collection and&#13;
consultation to prepare a description and analysis of the present situation.&#13;
*   Stage II (January - February 1996) involved intensive consultation based on the&#13;
findings of Stage 1, validation of information, leading to formulation of a project&#13;
implementation strategy and confirmation of project components.&#13;
*   Stage III (March - May 1996) involved finalizing the development strategy for the&#13;
project and detailed planning of implementation arrangements. The Final Report&#13;
was completed in August 1996 following a workshop in Hanoi in July 1996 to&#13;
review the Draft Final Report.&#13;
2.     A Planning Facilitator was part of the preparation team to ensure that a participatory&#13;
approach was taken and to coordinate a systems analysis of issues related to the project design.&#13;
The former task involved the facilitation of a range of group interactions; individual discussions&#13;
with consultants; encouraging and facilitating the use of appropriate participatory methods; and&#13;
facilitating an improved understanding of the meaning of, and ways to, implement participation&#13;
so team members could critically reflect upon, review, and develop their own approach and&#13;
outcomes.&#13;
3.     Four formal "stakeholders" workshops were held; at the beginning of Stage I, Stage II&#13;
and Stage III and, to review the Draft Final Report. Other workshops for specific purposes were&#13;
also held. These workshops and their outputs are briefly described below.&#13;
Initial Project Workshop&#13;
4.     An initial project workshop was held in Hanoi from 1-3 November 1995 attended by&#13;
foreign and local consultants, government counterparts and resource persons (including&#13;
international NGOs) familiar with the issues to be addressed by the project. The purpose of the&#13;
workshop was to i) introduce consultants and counterparts to the participatory process, ii)&#13;
develop a common appreciation of the issues to be addressed begin to assess priorities and iii)&#13;
agree a detailed work plan for Stage I of the study.&#13;
5.     A series of plenary presentations and review sessions and small group discussions was&#13;
employed to consider:&#13;
*  a historical review of factors affecting the forest sector in Vietnam;&#13;
* future trends and factors affecting developments in the forest sector;&#13;
* identification of the various groups of people and institutions involved in or affected&#13;
by the proposed project;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

*  discussion of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and constraints which the project&#13;
could build upon or accommodate, and;&#13;
*  discussion of the clhanges that a successful project would bring about.&#13;
National Workshop to Review the Inception Report&#13;
6.     The purpose of the workshop, held in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) from 10-12 January&#13;
1996, was to review the Inception Report, and facilitate a structured discussion regarding key&#13;
issues affecting project design which were identified in the report and subsequent discussions.&#13;
This information would be Lused to help formulate a detailed workplan for Stage II of&#13;
preparation. Four key issues were discussed in group and plenary discussions: i) definition of the&#13;
Buffer Zone, ii) migration and resettlement, iii) protected area management and, iv) sustainable&#13;
rural development.&#13;
National Workshop to Review the Interim Report&#13;
7.     This workshop was held in HCMC on 12-13 March 1996. The aim was to ensure that&#13;
the proposed project design framework met key stakeholders expectations and approval, prior to&#13;
the detailed planning for implementing this framework which would forn the final stage of&#13;
project preparation. This was achieved by reviewing the Interim Report, hearinig reports on the&#13;
main outcomes of the PRA/social survey activities, and then giving all participants a chance to&#13;
comment on any aspects of the work to date.&#13;
8.     Representatives were invited through NPC from the five participating provinces, and&#13;
from  planning and inventory institutes, i.e., FIPI and NIAPP.   Participants included&#13;
representatives of relevant government ministries and organizations, and provincial&#13;
representatives. Two provinces sent Vice-Chairman of the provincial Peoples' Committee who&#13;
also chaired the project's Provincial Steering Committee. Fifty one participants attended at least&#13;
one day of the workshop.&#13;
National Workshop to Review the Draft Final Report&#13;
9.     This workshop was held in Hanoi 4 July 1996. The aim was to review the Draft Final&#13;
Report and confirm stakeholders acceptance of the proposed project design and arrangements for&#13;
implementation. The review was undertaken in a formal meeting format whereby a presentation&#13;
by the NPC and consultant team leader was followed by comments from representatives of each&#13;
national government agency, participating province, and international NGOs.&#13;
10.    Workshop participants endorsed the proposed project design and confirmed that it is&#13;
consistent with existing government policies and builds upon existing experiences. There was&#13;
also agreement that all components and activities identified are necessary to meet the project&#13;
objective of protecting high value forest biodiversity in Vietnam. Major concerns raised relate to&#13;
the relatively high project management cost as compared to overall project cost and the need to&#13;
clarify financing mechanisms relating to national and provincial government financing. The&#13;
high cost of project management related to the need for building implementation capacity to&#13;
undertake a relatively complex project in five provinces and the "pilot nature" of the bottom up&#13;
planning process involved. Approval was given to finalize the preparation report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Provincial and local level consultations&#13;
11.   Following the initial workshop in Hanoi on 1-3 November 1995, each Provincial&#13;
Steering Committee was requested to nominate a Provincial Coordinator to act as the focus for&#13;
communications regarding the preparation work.  A workshop was held with Provincial&#13;
Coordinators in HCMC on 7 November to:&#13;
* introduce Provincial Coordinators and others from government agencies in HCMC&#13;
to the preparation team and the objectives of the preparation exercise;&#13;
* discuss the outputs of the first workshop in Hanoi;&#13;
* plan field visit program;&#13;
*  discuss information requirements.&#13;
12.   Although it was envisaged that Provincial Working Groups would also be formed to&#13;
facilitate consultation with project beneficiaries and affected groups at the local level, it proved&#13;
difficult because this concept is new in Vietnam and does not fit into their normal administrative&#13;
procedures. In the absence of the Provincial Working Groups, the start of the PRA exercises was&#13;
used to introduce local stakeholders from the Buffer Zone communes and districts to the project,&#13;
and to inform them about progress with its development. In each of the three PRA exercises (in&#13;
Dong Nai, Kon Tum and Lam Dong provinces) an initial three day interactive training and&#13;
planning workshop was held. The aim of this was to train the small team who would&#13;
subsequently conduct the PRA exercises in the villages, and to inform local leaders about the&#13;
exercise and about the objectives, scope, and timing of the project. A key aim was to try to&#13;
ensure full understanding by local leaders of the preliminary nature of this exercise, and to try to&#13;
limit their expectations.&#13;
Team Meetings&#13;
13.   Throughout preparation process, team  meetings and workshops were organized,&#13;
involving local counterparts, local and foreign consultants to ensure that a participatory approach&#13;
was taken throughout all the project preparation stages. It enabled sharing of insights and&#13;
developing a systematic analysis of the issues. Regular summaries of key issues, principles and&#13;
guidelines were also produced from these team working sessions, which were incorporated into&#13;
Working Papers and specific aspects of project design.&#13;
Testing of the community participation approach&#13;
14.   During preparation, draft Commune Action Plans (CAPs) were prepared for Dak Lua&#13;
Commune, Tan Phu District, Dong Nai Province, and Le R'Mam Village of Mo Ray Commune,&#13;
Sa Thay District, Kon Tum Province for the following reasons: (i) field test the CAP process;&#13;
and (ii) establish how project-wide technical proposals could be applied at community level.&#13;
Preparatory PRAs of these communes was carried out in February 1996, and the Indicative&#13;
Development Plan was developed in April 1996. These exercises further tested the proposed&#13;
participatory and consultative process and the means by which community participation will be&#13;
applied during project implementationi.&#13;

Other Interactions during Project Preparation&#13;
15.   A wide range of groups, organizations and individuals were consulted by team members.&#13;
These include Vietnamese Forestry, Science and Technology Association; Central Council of&#13;
Cooperative Unions and Small and Medium Enterprises of Vietnam; Australian Center for&#13;
International Agricultural Research; University of Agriculture and Forestry HCMC; Cat Tien&#13;
National Park; World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF); CARE; Forest Inventory and Planning&#13;
Institute (FIPI); National Institute of Agricultural Planning and Projection (NIAPP); Forest&#13;
Science Institute of Vietnam; University of Can Tho; Institute of Social Sciences HCMC;&#13;
Programme De Recherche Forestiere CNRS France-Vietnam; Anthropology Institute; National&#13;
Environment Authority; Institute of Environment and Biological Research; credit institutions,&#13;
and other development projects related to this project (Dutch, Danish, Japanlese, World Bank,&#13;
and UNDP). In addition, during field visits, a wide range and number of discussions were held&#13;
with local institutes, commercial enterprises, forest enterprises, households in the Buffer Zone,&#13;
and communes and district officials from Buffer Zones areas.&#13;
16.   A pre-project preparation meeting was held between the National Project Steering&#13;
Committee, NPC, (potential) participating provincial People's Committee Vice-Chair or&#13;
designate, World Bank, and consultant team leader to clarify project objectives, roles and&#13;
responsibilities of each concerned party, and needs and requirements of preparation team. This&#13;
was a pre-requisite to developing a shared vision of and commitment to the project.&#13;
17.   Two meetings with interested NGOs were convened by MARD. A third took place&#13;
during the pre-project preparation mission. These consultations provided opportunities for&#13;
NGOs to express concerns and to share their experiences in carrying-out similar types of projects&#13;
in Vietnam.&#13;

2.     The population of the communities in the Project area can broadly be divided into three&#13;
categories:&#13;
i) Indigenous Ethnic Minorities who are original residents of the area and traditionally&#13;
live in close association with the forest. These people practice varying degrees of&#13;
shifting cultivation, though most live in settled communities. Traditionally they have&#13;
made extensive use of forest products for subsistence purposes. They are mostly&#13;
poor and dependent on forest products for at least part of the year (Gia Rai, S'Tieng,&#13;
Chau Ma, Ha Lang, Cho Ro and R'Mam);&#13;
ii) members of the predominant Kinh ethnic group who have settled over the past 15&#13;
years or so and are now well established mainly in the river plains where they&#13;
cultivate wetland rice. They may engage in some hunting and trading in forest&#13;
products. This group generally has the highest living standards;&#13;
iii) Newly arrived settlers, mostly ethnic minorities from northern Vietnam but also&#13;
some Kinh. These communities tend to occupy upland areas between the lowlands&#13;
and the forest and are extensively engaged in clearing of land for agriculture. (Tay,&#13;
Nung, Dao, Cao Lan, Hmong, and Hoa).&#13;

CTNP                106,432        11,580 (11%)       84,940 (80%)     9,912 (9%)&#13;
Note: The figures for CTNP do not include approximately 60,000 persons living in 12 communes and&#13;
one district town covered under the Dutch funded Cat Tien National Park Conservation project.&#13;
3.     The Kinh have mainly entered the area as cultivators of wet rice and industrial crops&#13;
within the government-sponsored migration, providing labour for State Enterprises and New&#13;
Economic Zones, or in more recent unorganised migration as traders and farmers. They have&#13;
been able to secure land for wet-rice cultivation, are welcomed by the local authorities, and have&#13;
increased the pressure on land.&#13;
4.     The ethnic minorities who migrated recently from the northern provinces started arriving&#13;
around 1987, but most have come after 1990. They have settled in large numbers between Cat&#13;
Tien National Park and Cat Loc Nature Reserve. Many, primarily Nung and Tay, have&#13;
constructed rainfed wet ricefields, while the smaller groups to some extent make a living from&#13;
sedentary shifting cultivation. So far, there is only limited contact between these groups and the&#13;
local authorities, and they further reduce land availability for the indigenous ethnic groups.&#13;
5.    The groups most dependent on subsistence products from the forest are the indigenous&#13;
minorities and the recent settlers who are still trying to establish an agricultural or alternative&#13;
livelihood basis. Because of growing population pressure the agricultural practices of these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
groups are becoming increasingly unsustainable. Field surveys showed a high correlation&#13;
between the level of poverty and dependence on forest products. Other closely related factors&#13;
were proximity of the community to the forest and the presence of indigenous minorities in the&#13;
community.&#13;
6.    The villages in the buffer zone communes are homogeneously populated, i.e. they are&#13;
either kinh, indigenous minorities or immigrated ethnic minorities.&#13;

Since Protected Area (PA) management activities are being financed under a separate project, CTNPCP, and is not under the direct influence of the proposed project,  l&#13;
the development objective can only address strengthening protection through buffer zone activities to alleviate the pressure on the PA.&#13;

THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM&#13;
Forest Protection and Rural Development Project&#13;
Description of Community Development Planning Process&#13;
I.    Success of the proposed project will, in part, require a change in the actions and attitudes&#13;
of the communities which presently exploit the Protected Areas. This will be achieved by&#13;
providing for the informed participation of the community in the decision-making process,&#13;
ensuring that programs in each community are tailored to the needs and priorities of the people&#13;
involved. Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) methods will be used to assess those needs and&#13;
ensure that the needs of all segments of the community including ethnic minorities and the very&#13;
poor are considered.&#13;
2.    The aim of community development planning process is to identify and plan for the socio-&#13;
economic development needs of Buffer Zone communities and to establish a basis for further socio-&#13;
economic progress. The proposed planning process leading to development of a draft Commune&#13;
Action Plan (CAP) builds upon models being applied in Vietnam and elsewhere in Asia and was&#13;
field tested in two project communes during preparation.&#13;
3.    This process consists of the following steps to be facilitated by a Community Advisory&#13;
Group (CAG) consisting of experts in sociology, PRA methods, agroforestry, agro-economics&#13;
and other specialties, contracted by the Project (see Project Implementation Manual for more&#13;
detail):&#13;
*  Preparation visit to the villages of one commune, estimated to last seven to ten days,&#13;
during which time the CAG would inform villagers about the Project and discuss&#13;
possible activities within the scope of the Project.&#13;
*  Conduct a PRA exercise in each village to collect baseline information, identify&#13;
initial and urgent needs of the communities, and identify representatives to form a&#13;
project Commune Working Group (CWG).&#13;
*  Consultation and assessment of feasibility of proposed activities with commune and&#13;
district technical staff.&#13;
* Return to villages to validate information and adjust plans.&#13;
*  Negotiation and finalization of CAP with commune, and formal establishment of&#13;
CWG, confirmed by the Commune People's Council.&#13;
4.    During this process, all concerned parties will be involved, including provincial, district&#13;
and commune staff, village leaders and farmers, men and women. An initial PRA will establish a&#13;
broad range of information about the commune and the needs and priorities of all its people. The&#13;
PRA will also identify a minimum of five respected and capable people to form the CWG, which&#13;
will act as a coordinating group between the Project and its agents, the Commune People's&#13;
Committee, villagers, traders and others in the community. The CWG will include representatives&#13;
from the poorer segments of the commune, relevant women's groups and every indigenous ethnic&#13;
minority group. The CWP will be established by, and be directly accountable to, the Commune&#13;
People's Council.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 5&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
5.     The CAG  will work closely in the field with staff of the Provincial Extension&#13;
Center/District Extension Center (PEC/DEC), and other relevant technical agencies at all stages&#13;
during the planning process. Representatives of these agencies will be invited to participate in the&#13;
PRA process and to provide additional technical support during review of the needs and priorities&#13;
of Buffer Zone communities and during negotiation of the CAP. Local technical staff and&#13;
community participants will thus gain experience in the use of PRA methods and the formulation of&#13;
community-based plans.&#13;
6.     A prioritized list of investment proposals for project assistance will form the basis of&#13;
negotiations between the CWG representing the beneficiaries in the commune and the Project to&#13;
reach agreement on a draft CAP. The purpose of the negotiation is to establish the basis for&#13;
counterpart contribution from beneficiaries of Project investments, to obtain commitment from the&#13;
community regarding maintenance, and to agree on the conservation measures which will be&#13;
conditional for funding the CAP. (See Table I for elements of negotiations).&#13;
7.    In return for goods and services provided by the Project, the CWG, on behalf of the&#13;
commune beneficiaries, will be required to enter into a conservation agreement with the Director&#13;
of PA to respect restrictions on activities which may adversely affect the Protected Areas. This&#13;
agreement also will be signed by the Director of PPMU and representatives of the mass&#13;
organizations in the Commune as the basis for provision of Project goods and services.&#13;
8.     Compliance with the conservation agreement will be monitored by the CWG and staff of&#13;
the Protected Area Management Board on a regular basis and periodically by PPMU staff.&#13;
Sanctions for breach of contract may include suspension of disbursements on1 Project activities&#13;
(either for specific activities or for the commune's annual program), repayment of benefits received&#13;
by beneficiaries (where practical), and ineligibility for rural infrastructure investments (for which&#13;
proposals are likely to be considered after year 3 of implementation).&#13;
9.     Since it would not be possible to conduct the planning process at all participating&#13;
communes at the same time, priority will be determined for each province by the PPMU and&#13;
confirmed by PPSC based on selection criteria listed in Table 2.&#13;
Sequence of Implementation&#13;
10.    The community development planning process will be implemented in parallel with the&#13;
commune-based, land use planning and land allocation process. This will ensure that development&#13;
alternatives considered are consistent with community consensus on sustainable land use practices.&#13;
Land allocation will encourage stable long term land use, reduce land disputes and limit the growth&#13;
in population pressure due to spontaneous in-migration.&#13;

Negotiation                                 Description&#13;
Element&#13;
Conservation     The CAP wi ll include a conservation agreement to support the conservation&#13;
Agreement        objective of the project. The agreement will be negotiated and signed by the&#13;
CWG on behalf of beneficiaries and PA director, and also signed by&#13;
representatives of mass organisations in the commune and the provincial&#13;
project manager. Sub-projects will be supported on the basis of an agreement&#13;
between the CWG and the beneficiary household(s) or community group(s).&#13;
Social Support    The Project will allocate grant funds to the commune for Social Support at a rate&#13;
Grant            of US$300 per poor household as defined by government criteria. Eligible&#13;
households include permanent and provisionally registered people.&#13;
Unregistered people will not be eligible, except in the case of indigenous ethnic&#13;
minorities. The grant is intended to meet community social needs, described in&#13;
separate guidelines, and will require a contribution from beneficiaries in cash or&#13;
in kind.&#13;
Rural            The CAG will present options for increasing household income through&#13;
Development      sustainable agricultural and agro-forestry development. Agricultural Support&#13;
Proposals        Services and Rural Infrastructure proposals may be funded by grant or&#13;
commercial credit from VBA&amp;RD.&#13;
Land Allocation   The District People's Committee and the CWG will ensure that all commune&#13;
land is allocated to an approved individual or organisation (e.g. village&#13;
community group or state enterprise) user. This is a critical measure to reduce&#13;
the attractiveness of the Buffer Zone to free migration. As far as possible, the&#13;
land allocation process should ensure that all households applying for land&#13;
receive land to meet their basic needs. Poor households will receive priority for&#13;
allocation of land under Forest Protection Contracts.&#13;
Coordination     Implementation procedures must coordinate with those of the Dutch-funded Cat&#13;
Tien National Park (CTNP) Project to ensure that all communes have similar&#13;
responsibilities and assistance.&#13;
Approval Process  The CAP will be negotiated between the Project and CWG, signed by the CWG&#13;
of the CAP       chairperson, the PPMU Manager, representatives of mass organizations, and the&#13;
PA Director. The CAP, together with the conservation agreement, will be&#13;
submitted to Province Project Steering Committee (PPSC) for approval. After&#13;
approval by PPSC, the CAP will be included in the Project budget and workplan&#13;
for budget approval and implementation.&#13;

11.    After social and economic support services are operating and the community has&#13;
demonstrated compliance to the conservation agreement, provision of larger development&#13;
investments in the form of public irrigation and local road rehabilitation will be considered. Care&#13;
will be taken to avoid the risk of in-migration due to a "magnet effect" caused by a higher level of&#13;
development services in areas where spontaneous migration cannot be effectively managed.&#13;

Forest Protection and Rural Development Project&#13;
Guidelines For Social Support Grants&#13;
1.    Purpose.  Improving the social well-being of the residents in the buffer zone&#13;
communities adjoining the Protected Areas (PA) of Cat Tien National Park and Chu Mom Ray&#13;
Nature Reserve is an important tool to secure local commitment to their protection. The buffer&#13;
zone communes, especially households nearest to the PA, tend to be poorer and are also likely to&#13;
be indigenous ethnic minorities. The Social Support Grants (SSG) program will provide small-&#13;
scale grants to local communities to finance environmentally sustainable economic activities that&#13;
contribute to a reduction in land-use pressures and in extraction of protected resources from the&#13;
PA. In addition, SSG program will strike a balance in social support -- to empower and improve&#13;
the social well-being of the relevant community and ensure that the vulnerable groups, which is&#13;
the most critical to forest protection, are not left out. Experiences from Vietnam and other&#13;
countries indicate that programs targeting development of the most vulnerable groups alone&#13;
often do not achieve their objectives since solutions to their problems invariably involve the&#13;
community (village/hamlet and commune) at large.&#13;
2.     Eligibility Criteria. SSG will be allocated to 40 participating project communes/district&#13;
towns based on US$300 per eligible household (i.e., those whose income is equivalent to or less&#13;
than 15 kg of rice per person per month). The use of the commune level SSG is determined by&#13;
the Commune Action Plan (CAP) developed by the communities themselves managed by a&#13;
Commune Working Group (CWG) assisted by a Commune Advisory Group (CAG). The CAP&#13;
will have, among other things, social support activities prioritized with respect to what is&#13;
important to the commune. These activities are likely to be communal in nature and/or be social&#13;
infrastructure-related such as:&#13;
*  activities which improve access to basic services of education, health or potable&#13;
water supplies (e.g., adding to or repairing of schools, health posts, community&#13;
activity buildings, and completion of electricity connections);&#13;
*  activities that improve social and environmental awareness (e.g., health training,&#13;
biodiversity and conservation awareness promotion)&#13;
*  activities which increase food security (ranging from assistance to poor households&#13;
for food/subsistence production, introduction of proper sloping agriculture&#13;
technologies to stabilize farm incomes, to establishment of community storage&#13;
facilities);&#13;
*  services which can provide more equitable access to economic opportunities,&#13;
especially for the poorer segment of the community (e.g., productive activities which&#13;
cannot be funded through the VBA&amp;RD or other commercial banks because of lack&#13;
of collateral, agricultural field days, and marketing facilities);&#13;
*  services which ensure sustainability of community development efforts (e.g.,&#13;
training in organizing and managing community revolving funds);&#13;
*  activities which foster the retention of cultural traditions especially for indigenous&#13;
ethnic minorities (cottage industry promotion, language and cultural training for the&#13;
young)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

3.    Restrictions for use of the SSG would be as follows:&#13;
(a) Each activity/investment should not exceed US$20,000;&#13;
(b) The investment proposal cannot include the following list of activities/investments&#13;
(some of which are covered by the rural infrastructure or agriculture support services&#13;
subcomponents):&#13;
*  upgrading or construction of commune to district or commune to commune&#13;
roads (minor culverts, bridges);&#13;
*  direct investment in commercial processing or manufacturing activity;&#13;
*  payment directly into another fund (e.g., community revolving fund) for&#13;
unspecified activities;&#13;
* secondary education or secondary health facilities;&#13;
* purchase of land or motorized vehicles;&#13;
* any project which may adversely impact on the PAs;&#13;
* any illegal activity.&#13;
4.    Application and Review Procedures. After the list of eligible activities have been&#13;
technically evaluated, prioritized and agreed upon by the CWG (with assistance from CAG), the&#13;
CAP will include a brief description of each subproject to be funded by the SSG, including (i)&#13;
inputs to be provided by both project implementors and beneficiaries; (ii) implementation&#13;
arrangements including procurement methods and schedule; (iii) commitment to maintain project&#13;
investments; and (iv) identification of direct beneficiaries of the subproject. Beneficiaries are&#13;
expected to pay a contribution in cash or in kind, equivalent to a minimum of 10 percent of the&#13;
value of each subproject investment. The CWG will then negotiate with the PA director on a list&#13;
of actions, including an agreement not to enter or exploit the core PA unsustainably, to be taken&#13;
by the communities in exchange for the CAP. A "conservation agreement" including the CAP&#13;
will then be submitted to the PPMU for review to ensure that all subprojects being proposed in&#13;
the CAP meet the agreed eligibility criteria. If any changes to the CAP are proposed, these must&#13;
be agreed with the CWG prior to signing. After final approval by the PPMU, the conservation&#13;
agreement will be signed by the chairperson of the CWG on behalf of the beneficiaries,&#13;
representatives of mass organizations, the PA Director, and PPMU.&#13;
5.    Implementation Procedures. After signing of the conservation agreement, annual&#13;
work and financial plans will be developed by the PPMU based on the agreed CAPs and budgets&#13;
allocated accordingly. CAP activities will be funded by the project through PPMU as contracts&#13;
either to communities directly or to specialist institutions, service agencies, and non-&#13;
governmental organizations. Where possible, organizations located within the commune or&#13;
nearby will be used. However, where small-scale activities at commune level may involve&#13;
engaging a community organization, contracting with the community organization may be&#13;
delegated to the CWG on behalf of the PPMU. CAP activities will normally be implemented&#13;
over a period of three years. Implementation of the CAP will be reviewed annually by PPMU.&#13;
Continued disbursement for CAP activities will be subject to ongoing observance of the&#13;
conservation agreement by beneficiaries.&#13;
6.    Financial Management. IDA will finance no more than 90 percent of a CAP; the&#13;
remainder will be financed by local counterpart funding from local government or beneficiaries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

in cash or kind. GOV has indicated that any cost recovery from beneficiaries of the SSG could&#13;
be paid into a special livelihood fund at the village level (to be administered by the villagers&#13;
themselves) with the aim of improving the livelihood situation of poorer families.&#13;
7.    Monitoring and Evaluation. The CWG will regularly supervise the implementation of&#13;
the CAP, provide semi-annual progress reports to the PPMU, and review implementation&#13;
performance with PPMU prior to preparation of annual work and financial plan. The PPMUs&#13;
will be responsible for overall monitoring and supervision of the SSG program in their respective&#13;
provinces and for verifying the accuracy of the information included in the commune progress&#13;
reports with assistance from an independent Monitoring and Auditing Team (MAT). The MAT&#13;
will carry out such reviews on an annual basis. MARD/PMU will provide an evaluation report&#13;
that analyzes the implementation experience of the overall SSG program for the Mid-Term&#13;
Review of the project.&#13;

Forest Protection and Rural Development Project&#13;
Economic and Financial Analysis of Project Components&#13;
1.     The main objective of this project is the protection of natural forest with high&#13;
concentrations of biodiversity. However, there are no generally accepted ways of quantifying the&#13;
value of biodiversity. Since qualitative benefits from the preservation of the ecosystem have&#13;
been discussed in the main text, this annex will focus on the estimation of quantifiable returns to&#13;
project investments for the Buffer Zone Development Component.&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
2.     Buffer Zone Investments. Because benefits are interdependent, the economic rate of&#13;
return for the buffer zone component is calculated on an aggregated basis -- combining the&#13;
investment costs for roads witlh irrigation investments and with the cost of adopting the more&#13;
remunerative "technology packages". Table I presents, for the five project areas combined, an&#13;
aggregated economic analysis of investments in: (a) agriculture -- which includes staple food&#13;
grains, agro-forestry, cash crop production (including tree crops like rubber and coffee) and&#13;
livestock; and (b) irrigation infrastructure and road construction. The economic returns for the&#13;
combined investments is 13 percent as given below.&#13;

This number includes the benefits due to increased economic activity outside the buffer zone&#13;
communes (e.g., from inter-commune roads and irrigation investment command areas outside&#13;
the buffer communes). These non-buffer beneficiary households are estimated to account for 45&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

percent of the total households in the five project areas. We have conservatively assessed the&#13;
benefits for these 'other beneficiaries' to be VND 100,000 per household per annumi (around&#13;
US$ 9). Leaving out these benefits, would give an economic rate of return (ERR) of 8 percent.&#13;
3.     The numbers and detailed assumptions underlying Table 1 are given in the Project&#13;
Preparation Study.  The computation of output values is based on relatively conservative&#13;
assumptions of production and farm level prices. The improved output values are mainly&#13;
derived from yield and cropping density improvement from the adoption of new technologies as&#13;
a result of improved credit extension support and from irrigation. Incremental benefits and costs&#13;
are based on a 'future without' scenario that assumes a small gradual deterioration of main&#13;
agricultural production without project interventions--reflecting the degradation pressures faced&#13;
in these areas.  Incremental recurrent costs are mainly additional imputed farm  labor and&#13;
agricultural inputs, as well as some road maintenance.&#13;
4.     Agricultural benefits are derived from individual enterprise and household models based&#13;
on cropping systems before (without) and after (with) project interventions. The cropping&#13;
systems chosen for the models are assumed to be the "appropriate choice" (with respect to&#13;
farming and household resource conditions) from a range of possibilities which would be&#13;
selected through the Commune Action Planning (CAP) process. They include economic&#13;
activities, such as commercial food crop (including upland maize production), rubber and coffee&#13;
production.  Most of these activities that will be promoted under the project will have high&#13;
financial rates of return (well above 20 percent) as a number of the technology packages to be&#13;
adopted do not need high capital investment. They are calculated from the financial return&#13;
models (see paras 7-10 below) with adjustments for net taxes on the input and capital costs and&#13;
are based on the shadow pricing of labor at the market unskilled labor rate. The specific&#13;
packages selected depend on the preferences of the communes and the "appropriateness" as&#13;
determined under the CAP process. For irrigation, the benefits for wlich can be analyzed&#13;
separately, the capital investment in irrigation infrastructure (excluding O&amp;M costs after the first&#13;
year of production) in the five sub project areas is estimated at D34 billion (US$ 3 million). The&#13;
benefits that can be directly attributed to irrigation (including coffee production) in the five&#13;
project areas will generate an economic rate of return estimated at 1.5 percent.&#13;
5.     Sensitivity Analysis   The two main risks for the buffer zone investments, selected for&#13;
sensitivity analysis are: (a) benefits will be slower in emerging than originally expected; and (b)&#13;
actual benefits from the investments will be less than projected. Item (a) is presented below&#13;
based on the calculations showing a delay in benefits by one year, that could be due to initial&#13;
problems with the introduction of new farming systems. This will reduce thle economic rate of&#13;
return to 9 percent.&#13;
The Project Preparation Report used a range of D. 275,000 - 325,000. Although an argument can be&#13;
made that even these estimates are conservative because the households outside the buffer commune&#13;
areas tend to be more commercializable , we have assumed a figure of only one third of these&#13;
estimates to be conservative.&#13;

Item (b) could reflect a situation where actual benefits could also be less than projected due to,&#13;
for example, marketing problems for crops produced. A 10 percent reduction in production&#13;
value is expected to lower the economic rate of return to 6 percent (Table 3).&#13;

However, if benefits are less than expected because of lower output prices, input prices are&#13;
likely to be lower as well. In such a scenario, for item (b), the actual economic rates of return&#13;
will remain at about 9 percent.&#13;
6.     Costs and Benefits Excluded from the Calculations.  The analysis above focuses on&#13;
direct costs due to buffer zone interventions. Additional project costs such as technical assistance&#13;
for land allocation, and social and technical support services are not included in the economic&#13;
analysis. If these were to be added, the economic rate of return would drop, although these costs&#13;
are relatively minor. Also excluded from the ERR calculations are those costs incurred through&#13;
project management. To include these would require the attribution of project overheads&#13;
between forest management and buffer zone development--an exercise that is considered to be&#13;
quite arbitrary and is therefore not attempted. Some benefits are also excluded. First, forest&#13;
protection and the promotion of more sustainable land use practices will enhance water retention,&#13;
decrease sedimentation, and generally benefit downstream water users. Furtherrnore, in the&#13;
project area, the additional income created are expected to have a multiplier effect in reducing&#13;
the current level of unemployment or underemployment. Inclusion of these benefits would&#13;
likely increase the ERR significantly.&#13;
Financial Analysis&#13;
7.     Financial Benefits. For a project which counts on improving the income and livelihood&#13;
status of buffer households to secure their joint cooperation in forest protection, the financial&#13;
rates of return for these households will have to be high enough to motivate active participation.&#13;
For subsistence or food staple crops, the incremental financial returns to the family labor effort&#13;
is an important indicator of such an incentive. The improved technologies to be introduced (for&#13;
various systems of paddy production and for maize and mungbeans) will improve the returns per&#13;
labor day from levels close to the market unskilled wage rate (about VND 11,000- 12,000/day) in&#13;
the "without project" case to levels ranging from VND 12,000-27,000/day in the "with project"&#13;
case, as summarized below:&#13;
Food Staple Crop             Without Project               With Project&#13;
VND/Labor Day&#13;
Summer wetland paddy (new)                                          27,241&#13;
Autumn wetland paddy (new)               -                          22,574&#13;
Uplanid paddy                         10,556                        20,617&#13;
Shifting (Swidden) paddy               5,106                         7,938&#13;
Upland maize                          13,178                         17,893&#13;
Upland mungbeans                      10,910                         12,256&#13;
Except for rice (paddy) under shifting cultivation (usually involving ethnic minority households),&#13;
the imputed net income per labor day (i.e., opportunity cost for family labor) is roughly&#13;
equivalent to the market wage for unskilled labor (assuming that jobs are available). Under the&#13;
project, at full development, the returns to labor will be significantly higher than the market&#13;
wage rate, except possibly for mungbeans grown under rainfed conditions.&#13;
8.     For cash crops, incremental financial returns would essentially vary according to the&#13;
types of buffer zone households, their farm endowment and location, and the market&#13;
opportunities. In accessible areas with relatively good basaltic soils in the CTNP buffer zone&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
Annex 15&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
(especially parts of Lam Dong and Dong Nai provinces), credit availability (from VBA&amp;RD or a&#13;
community revolving fund) together with project assistance in organizing farmers (through the&#13;
development of the Commune Action Plan), could enable households to achieve incremental&#13;
financial rates of return (FRRs) ranging from 20 to 75 percent (supporting tables are in the&#13;
project file). This would be applicable to the rainfed farming of annual crops (ranging from&#13;
improved rice, maize, mulberry or sericulture) and livestock, as well as to the introduction of&#13;
irrigation to permit the cultivation of high yielding variety rice, hybrid maize, and coffee. In less&#13;
well endowed farms facing less favorable market access, extension service and subsistence credit&#13;
assistance could help farmers through critical cash-short months and thus enable them to at least&#13;
grow enough food (i.e., upland rice and maize) for family subsistence as a prelude to introducing&#13;
the production of high value cash crops..&#13;
9.    In the generally less accessible CMRNR buffer zone, where extensive barren land exists,&#13;
an extension package which includes the planting of multi-purpose fodder trees (to permit&#13;
farmers to harvest leaves for livestock feeding in the dry season) would significantly improve&#13;
livestock productivity and farm income. In some areas close to rubber plantations or sugar mills,&#13;
opportunities exist for the introduction of raw material cash crops like rubber and sugar, the FRR&#13;
of which are approximately 14 percent and 20 percent respectively. In some degraded forest&#13;
areas, agroforestry (with a FRR of about 13 percent) may be an option. For the many poor (and&#13;
often hungry) households in the less accessible forested buffer areas, employment opportunities&#13;
provided under the forest protection contracts (to manage and protect allocated parcels of&#13;
protection forests) may be the only source of cash income for these labor surplus, high poverty&#13;
areas. In any case, the raising of buffer zone incomes would mean that buffer lhouseholds would&#13;
be more responsive to public awareness or extension programs and hence be more receptive to a&#13;
change in the lifestyle that accepts greater responsibility for maintenance of the natural&#13;
resources.&#13;
10.   Irrigation infrastructure is the only sub-component where separate production benefits&#13;
may be imputed. The FRRs are summarized below for the main buffer zone project areas.&#13;
Irrigation development is expected to reach about 2,000 families (about 11,000 people) in the&#13;
buffer zones.&#13;

It should be noted that the rehabilitation of selected rural roads would increase the efficiency in&#13;
the delivery of both productive and social support service to project communes and would&#13;
enhance economic development. Thus, not only will the production of both food crops and&#13;
industrial crops be improved, but so will year-round food security.&#13;

THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM&#13;
Forest Protection and Rural Development Project&#13;
Summary of Environmental Review&#13;
I.    The project was subject of an Environmental Review carried out by the Environmental&#13;
Protection Center (EPC), which is part of the Vietnam Institute of Tropical Technology and&#13;
Environmental Protection under the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment. The purpose&#13;
of the Review was two-fold: (a) to consider the potential environmental impacts of activities and&#13;
developments to be supported under the project; and,  (b) to identify any existing or planned&#13;
developments in the vicinity of the project areas having the potential to adversely affect the&#13;
sustainability or effectiveness of the project. The review was based on initial drafts of the project&#13;
preparation documents, project site inspections and discussions with relevant National, Provincial and&#13;
District Government agencies.&#13;
Potential Environmental Impacts of Project Activities&#13;
2.     The Project was assessed as having generally positive environmental impacts through activities&#13;
designed to improve protection and management of natural resources. However, three aspects of the&#13;
project were identified as having some potential adverse environmental impact potential: (a) the Chu&#13;
Mom Ray Nature Reserve (CMRNR) infrastructure development program; (b) small-scale irrigation&#13;
developments; and, (c) rural road developments. These were subject to additional consideration.&#13;
(a) CMRNR Infrastructure Development Program. The potential direct impacts were found to be&#13;
minor and connected solely with the construction phase. The main risks are minor soil erosion,&#13;
minor drainage impairment and hydrological impacts associated with inappropriate disposal of&#13;
excavated materials and excess concrete associated with fords and culverts. All of these impacts&#13;
canl be adequately controlled by inclusion of suitable provisions in the contract specifications&#13;
(such specifications have been formulated in the Project Implementation Manual) combined with&#13;
effective construction supervision to ensure that the specifications are observed. Potential&#13;
indirect impacts could also arise due to the improved access into the Parks and Nature Reserves&#13;
for landless people, hunters and poachers provided by the upgraded roads although it was&#13;
conceded that this had to be balanced against the benefits that improved access would provide to&#13;
management and staff of the Park. The balance was assessed as favoring upgraded access.&#13;
lIncursionis and illegal exploitation are already occurring, even withi very poor access. The&#13;
improved access may make things marginally easier for encroachers but it will much more&#13;
significantly improve the capacity of forest rangers to detect and control these encroachments;&#13;
(b) Upgrading of rural roads. Direct environmental impact potentials arise during the construction&#13;
phase due to soil erosion, drainage impairment and inadequate disposal of excavated materials.&#13;
Similar to the CMRNR infrastructure improvement, these issues will be addressed through the&#13;
inclusion of suitable specifications in the contract documents and adequate construction&#13;
supervision. Potential indirect impacts could arise due to increased encroachment resulting from&#13;
development of new roads in the project areas. The recommended solution to this problem is&#13;
exclude new road developments from funding eligibility under the project. Only rehabilitation&#13;
of existing roads will be financed under the project;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
Annex 16&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
(c) Irrigation Sub-projects. Potential adverse impacts include: waterlogging of soils; increased&#13;
incidence of water-borne and water-related diseases; increases in the incidence of agricultural&#13;
pests and diseases resulting from the elimination of dry season die-back and the creation of a&#13;
more humid microclimate; increased pollution of surface and groundwater from fertilizers and&#13;
agricultural biocides; and, adverse water quality and biological impacts due to in-stream&#13;
activities such as weir/dam construction or rehabilitation, river bank rehiforcement and bridge,&#13;
ford or culvert construction.&#13;
The significance of these potential impacts is directly proportional to the at-ea of irrigable land to&#13;
be developed, the nature of the existing land use in the areas to be developed and the nature of the&#13;
irrigation offtake (i.e. weir or reservoir). By these criteria, the impact potentials of the proposed&#13;
developments are very small.  Approximately half of the area to be developed will be&#13;
rehabilitation of existing small schemes. The maximum incremental increase in irrigable area is&#13;
only about 280 ha; all areas are already being cropped so there will be no significant change in&#13;
land use; and no new weirs or reservoirs will be constructed.&#13;
New irrigation developments will all be less than 400 ha in area and most of the offtakes are weirs&#13;
having limited downstream impact potential. Four (Dak Can, Da Lay, Dak Lan and Dak Kar)&#13;
involve on-stream storage but the diversion levels will be very small (e.g. for the largest of these&#13;
four schemes, the peak water demand is likely to be in the order of 0.24 cumecs). All schemes are&#13;
significantly less than 2,500 ha in area which is a guideline used by several environmental&#13;
agencies in the Asia region for determining whether or not an environmenital impact assessment is&#13;
required. As an additional level of protection, the Project Implementationi Manual includes a pro-&#13;
forma Initial Environmental Screeninig report to provide a basis for determininig the acceptability&#13;
of new irrigation developments.&#13;
Potential Impacts of Activities in Surrounding Areas on the Project&#13;
3.     Wide-ranging investigations and consultations with Provincial and local government officials&#13;
identified three major external developments having potential to impact on the project: (a) tree crop&#13;
developments in the Central Highlands; (b) water resources developments in the Dong Nai River Basin;&#13;
and, (c) forest management activities by State-owned Forestry companies.&#13;
(a) Tree Crop Developments in the Central Highlands. In recent years, substantial areas of&#13;
"barren lands" in the Central Highlands have been converted from grassland to tree crops,&#13;
mainly coffee. Additional tree crop developments are likely to occur in the future although&#13;
alternative crops such as rubber and horticultural crops, may be favored over coffee. Provided&#13;
these developments are confinied to areas outside Nature Reserves- and are restricted to true&#13;
barren lands (i.e. areas which have already been cleared or otherwise degraded) they should&#13;
present no significanit threat to the project development areas or to nature conservation values in&#13;
genieral. In fact, these developments should support the objectives of the project insofar as they&#13;
will help increase rural incomes and alleviate poverty, permit productive use of the barren lands&#13;
and reduce the pressure to clear new lands including land inside Nature Reserves and State&#13;
Forests. It is in recognitioni of the potential social and economic benefits of such crops that the&#13;
Agricultural Support Services sub-component will include extension and demonstration of tree&#13;
crops such as rubber.  Nevertheless, there remains a residual albeit small risk of a land&#13;
development boom in the Central Highlanids region which could adversely affect nature reserves&#13;
and forested areas and contlict with the objectives of the project. The project includes a forest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 16&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
management sub-component which provides for increased forest protection through Forest&#13;
Protection contracts between households and the Provincial Forest Protection Branch.  If&#13;
successful, these should provide quite a strong level of protection against external land&#13;
conversion pressures.&#13;
(b) Water resources development opportunities in the Dong Nai River Basin. Development&#13;
opportunities in the Dong Nai River Basin have recently been the subject of a major river basin&#13;
management plan funded by the Japanese International Cooperation Agency. The major direct&#13;
threat to the project areas related to plans to establish multi-purpose darn developments in the&#13;
immediate vicinity of the Nam Cat Tien - Cat Loc area which would have resulted in inundation&#13;
of parts of Cat Tien National Park. However, the management plan recommended that these&#13;
developments should not proceed due to their adverse environmental impact potentials and poor&#13;
economic rates of return. The Dai Ninh hydropower development, well upstream of Cat Tien, is&#13;
due to commence construction within the next two years but, based on the eiivironmental impact&#13;
study for that development, it should have no significant impact on the environment in the&#13;
vicinity of Nam Cat Tien - Cat Loc.&#13;
(c) Forest Management Operations by State Forest Enterprises. These were subject of a&#13;
technical evaluation study as part of project preparation. The study noted that continuation of&#13;
present unsustainable cutting of natural forests under jurisdiction of the State Forest enterprises&#13;
represents an important threat to forest protection efforts in the project area, particularly the Nam&#13;
Cat Tien - Cat Loc area. The study predicted that, in 20 to 30 years, the Nam Cat Tien and Cat&#13;
Loc forests are likely to be the only natural forests of any consequence left in the southern part of&#13;
Vietnam. The forest management and joint forest protection activities being supported under the&#13;
project are clearly important to maintaining these resources in the long term however, but the&#13;
study also recommended additional protection could be provided if forest plantation&#13;
establishment on degraded forest lands was promoted to provide long term timber supplies&#13;
alternative to the remnants contained in the national parks and nature reserves. Support for such&#13;
investments is beyond the scope of the proposed project but a contribution will be made to this&#13;
longer term objective by supporting pilot activities to restructure a small number of adjoining&#13;
State Forest Enterprises. If these enterprises can be placed on a more financially sustainable&#13;
footing, the incentive to more rationally manage forest resources in their reserve areas will be&#13;
significantly increased.&#13;

            Vietnam - Forest Protection and Rural
            Development Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The overall objective of the Forest
            Protection and Rural Development Project is to assist
            Vietnam to protect and manage natural forests with high
            biodiversity. More specifically, the main development
            objectives are: 1) to effectively protect Cat Tien National
            Park (CTNP) and to effectively protect and manage the Chu
            Mom Ray Nature Reserve (CMRNR); 2) to effectively manage the
            remaining natural forests outside the protected areas (PA)
            but within the buffer zone of CTNP and CMRNR; 3) to reduce
            dependency on CTNP and CMRNR for subsistence and cash
            income; and  4) to strengthen capacity of the government to
            effectively design, implement, and monitor ICDPs. To achieve
            these objectives, three main components and their
            subcomponents comprise the project. The Protected Area
            Management for CMRNR Component provides for revising the
            existing Management Plan for CMRNR in two phases; implements
            the revised Management Plan including boundary demarcation,
            introduces PA management programs, supports basic
            infrastructure, and supplies basic equipment; implements
            selected research studies and surveys; formulates and
            implements a public awareness campaign in the CMRNR;
            develops programs to encourage and manage nature tourism in
            the PA and buffer zone; and trains PA staff to run the
            intensified conservation management and visitor programs.
            The Buffer Zone Development Component has six subcomponents:
            community development planning, land allocation involving
            land use planning at the commune level and helping to
            prepare cadastre maps and the issuance of land use
            certificates; social support in the form of "food
            security," basic infrastructure and activities to
            strengthen local social and cultural institutions;
            agricultural support services (extension, technology
            transfer, and public awareness); forest protection and
            management; and rural infrastructure improvement, including
            expanding irrigation systems, upgrading roads, and improving
            road access. The third component, Project Management and
            Institutional Development, includes strengthening
            institutional capacity at all levels to implement project
            activities and sustain project interventions.
