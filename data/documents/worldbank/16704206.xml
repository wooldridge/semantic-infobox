Improving Water Supply&#13;
and Sanitation Services&#13;
for the Urban Poor in India&#13;
In 2006â&#128;&#147;07, the Water and Sanitation Programâ&#128;&#147;South Asia (WSPâ&#128;&#147;SA) initiated a research to identify barriers to&#13;
service delivery for the urban poor. The findings of the research have been presented in the Guidance Notes on&#13;
Improving Water Supply and Sanitation Services for the Urban Poor in India. The Guidance Notes provide a&#13;
systematic analysis of the barriers to service delivery for the urban poor and recommend practical solutions and&#13;
strategies for overcoming these barriers. The Guidance Notes are based on an in-depth research of various&#13;
initiatives from across the world (including South Asian, African, and Latin American countries) and consultations&#13;
with urban poor communities across four major Indian cities (Mumbai, Bengaluru, Vadodara, and Delhi). An&#13;
accompanying volume, Global Experiences on Expanding Services to the Urban Poor, is a documentation of&#13;
â&#128;&#152;Global and Indian Case Studiesâ&#128;&#153; and â&#128;&#152;Consultations with Urban Poor Communitiesâ&#128;&#153;.&#13;

Box 1: PROSANEAR Project, Brazil: People Were Asked What They Wanted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Prior to planning water supply and sanitation projects, PROSANEAR teams went into communities to ask what kind of&#13;
water project the people wanted, if any, and what kind they would be willing to support with their money and labor.&#13;
Residents were allowed to talk about the full range of problems they faced, but once the discussion turned to the&#13;
importance of water supply and sanitation, they were generally eager to hear how PROSANEAR could help them.&#13;
Neighborhoods were allowed to choose from a range of simple, innovative systems that made water and sanitation&#13;
affordable and environmentally appropriate for poor crowded settlements. There were no blueprints. In many places,&#13;
groups of households were batched together in a creative condominial sewerage system approach that not only made&#13;
the networks more efficient and affordable but also forged new bonds among neighbors.&#13;
&#13;
PROSANEAR sought to make a permanent impact by mobilizing local clubs, as well as womenâ&#128;&#153;s, sports, and religious&#13;
groups, to educate people about the importance of sanitation and teaching them how to operate and maintain their new&#13;
systems. The results were powerful, and they went far beyond the better health and greater convenience enjoyed by&#13;
1 million people newly connected to water taps and toilets. For example, getting formal postal addresses and water bills&#13;
in their names meant they had graduated from squatter status to residentâ&#128;&#148;a new status in society.&#13;

Box 2: Stakeholder Participation in the Slum Sanitation Program in Mumbai&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Slum Sanitation Program initiated by the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation in 1995 with World Bank support was&#13;
based on a demand-driven and participatory approach, in which the municipality would provide the initial capital to build&#13;
community toilet blocks, while community-based organizations (CBOs) or small local business enterprises would take full&#13;
charge of operation and maintenance (O&amp;M).&#13;
&#13;
Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) were engaged to mobilize communities, facilitate relationships with the local&#13;
government, and train the communities in essential skills and attitudes. They initially carried out a general information&#13;
campaign that assessed the willingness and readiness of the communities to participate in the sanitation scheme. Once&#13;
communities mobilized and demonstrated an interest, CBOs or local enterprises were created (if not already existing and&#13;
active). These organizations were then registered to obtain legal status, which allowed them to manage the community&#13;
sanitation block (that is, obtain water, sewerage and electricity connections, sign a memorandum of understanding with&#13;
the Corporation, open and maintain a bank account to deposit the maintenance fund and earnings, pay utility bills,&#13;
and so on). It was only after the CBO or local enterprises had collected at least 50 percent of the expected&#13;
maintenance fund from prospective users and had developed a technically sound and community-endorsed plan&#13;
for the toilet block, that the Corporation issued the building permit and the actual construction of the community toilet&#13;
block began.&#13;
&#13;
Participation in the formal process of planning the services, creating a viable business entity, having it registered, opening&#13;
a bank account, and working with the Corporation provided invaluable experience, created confidence, and inspired&#13;
further entrepreneurial and community activities on the part of participants. In one case, a local enterprise that operates&#13;
the toilets has also established a preschool in the new community center that was built adjacent to the toilet block.&#13;

essential. Education that builds&#13;
such skills and attitudes not only&#13;

Communities&#13;
Community-based organizations&#13;
and their federations can help the&#13;
poor take action on their own&#13;
behalf. All the strategies described&#13;
above involve some form of&#13;
outreach to the poor. These are&#13;
essential to ensure that the formal&#13;
structures and decisionmaking&#13;
activities actively seek to serve the&#13;
poor better. But it is equally&#13;
important and effective for the poor&#13;
to take action for themselves. By&#13;
doing so, they gain self-respect and&#13;
important skills, as well as better&#13;
services. They also dispel commonly&#13;
held notions that the poor are&#13;
helpless or lack initiative. Self-help&#13;
activities can be initiated by a&#13;
dynamic individual within the&#13;
community or a nongovernmental&#13;
organization that is committed to&#13;
the interests of the community.&#13;

organization initiates action, it is&#13;

&#13;
Two South Asian experiencesâ&#128;&#148;the Orangi Pilot Project (OPP) in Karachi, Pakistan, and the activities of self-help groups&#13;
in Tiruchirapalli city, in the Indian state of Tamil Naduâ&#128;&#148;provide useful lessons about how community involvement&#13;
can help projects.&#13;
Orangi is Karachiâ&#128;&#153;s largest katchi abadi (informal settlement) and has a population of 1.2 million. The OPP was established in&#13;
1980 by Dr. Akhtar Hameed Khan, the renowned Pakistani social scientist. The OPP provided social and technical guidance&#13;
to enable low income families to construct and maintain an underground sewerage system with their own funds and under&#13;
their own management. The project has shown that poor people can finance and build sewers in their communities.&#13;
Working together internally as well as with the government to achieve their objectives has given community members dignity&#13;
as well as confidence in themselves. To date, the people of Orangi have laid down 1.3 million feet of sewer line and invested&#13;
about PKR 57.2 million (US$700,000).7 About 900,000 people in 94,122 houses have benefited. The average cost of the&#13;
system is very lowâ&#128;&#148;about PKR 1,000 (US$13) per household. The residents of Orangi maintain the system themselves at&#13;
no cost to the government. The OPP Research and Training Institute is currently assisting initiatives in a number of other&#13;
areas in Pakistan and other countries. Training in the OPP model has been provided to groups from Nepal, Cambodia,&#13;
Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Thailand, the Philippines, Central Asia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa.&#13;
In Tiruchirapalli city, about half the 339 community toilets in the city are being managed by community-based organizations&#13;
and half are managed by the city corporation. Since 2000, 41 of the community-managed toilets have been managed by&#13;
local Sanitation and Hygiene Education (SHE) teams supported by the nongovernmental organization Gramalaya and the&#13;
Womenâ&#128;&#153;s Action for Village Empowerment (WAVE), a federation of SHE teams. In each community, the SHE team organizes&#13;
its members (all women) into two to seven self-help groups with 15 to 20 members each. Each self-help group takes&#13;
responsibility for managing the community toiletsâ&#128;&#148;collecting user fees, keeping accounts, and depositing the income in a&#13;
bank accountâ&#128;&#148;for a month at a time. During that month, members of the responsible self-help group rotate as caretaker&#13;
and fee collector for a day at a time. In addition, most SHE teams employ two cleaners and a watchwoman. User fees are&#13;
used to cover operation and maintenance expenses. Each SHE team elects two members as team leaders who are&#13;
responsible for operating the bank account and represent the SHE team at WAVE meetings. When a major expenditure on&#13;
toilets is required, SHE teams can take a loan from the WAVE federation. For slum communities, the primary benefit of the&#13;
community-managed toilet complexes has been access to clean and safe sanitation facilities and a decrease in water-borne&#13;
diseases. The women who participate have gained new skills and confidence, which they often apply to other arenas in their&#13;
communities and households. From the city corporationâ&#128;&#153;s perspective, one of the major benefits is that this arrangement&#13;
reduces costs as a result of community-managed toilets. While some of the smaller toilet blocks require subsidies, these&#13;
can be justified by the overall benefits.&#13;

Take Vested&#13;
Interests&#13;
into Account&#13;
&amp;#12; Regularization of informal service providers often helps utilities to reduce&#13;
 illegal connections and corrupt practices by staff, lower water prices, and&#13;
 improve the reliability of services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Obstacles&#13;
Water vendors, organized crime,&#13;
corrupt public officials, and dishonest&#13;
utility staff may have a vested interest in&#13;
preventing better services for the poor.&#13;
&#13;
When the poor cannot get piped water&#13;
supply services legally they are forced&#13;
to provide for themselves in some&#13;
wayâ&#128;&#148;legal or illegal. In cities with a&#13;
high percentage of unserved&#13;
populations, such as Dhaka, Manila,&#13;
and Karachi, the amount of money that&#13;
passes hands informally in the water&#13;
sector to provide water to the unserved&#13;
population is reportedly greater than&#13;
the revenue of the formal service&#13;
provider. Vested interests will naturally&#13;
oppose any changes to the status quo&#13;
that threaten their source of revenue.&#13;
Sometimes confrontations can be&#13;
avoided by giving informal and illegal&#13;
service providers new roles or&#13;
incentives that bring them into the&#13;
formal system. Ultimately, improving&#13;
transparency reduces opportunities for&#13;
illicit activities.&#13;
&#13;
Incorporate&#13;
Informal Service&#13;
Providers into&#13;
the Solution&#13;
Institutional arrangements and legal&#13;
reforms that incorporate informal             informal service providers often helps        are adaptable to other environments. In&#13;
vested interests into the formal solution     utilities to reduce illegal connections and   some places, formal utilities have hired&#13;
reduce opposition and improve                 corrupt practices by staff, lower water       vendors who lost their markets when&#13;
transparency. Such arrangements               prices, and improve the reliability of        piped services were extended and&#13;
benefit both sides: the informal              servicesâ&#128;&#148;especially if adequate               improved. In Paraguay, local private&#13;
providers gain security and legitimacy,       regulatory arrangements are introduced.       firms that won contracts to build and&#13;
and the utility or alternative service                                                      operate new water supply systems in&#13;

Box 4: Water Kiosk Operators Unite in Kenya&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In the informal settlement of Kibera in Nairobi, Kenya, more than half-a-million poor people get water from over&#13;
650 informal local water kiosks. The kiosk operators lay pipes, as much as 1,500 meters long, to connect their storage&#13;
tanks to the local utility network. Although the utility recommends that water be sold for Ksh 19 per jerrycan (about&#13;
US$0.10), the prevailing price is usually Ksh 2 (the equivalent of US$1.30 per m3, or eight times the utilityâ&#128;&#153;s domestic tariff),&#13;
primarily because of the costs associated with establishing and running water kiosks: capital investment, bribes paid to&#13;
utility staff to obtain and retain a connection, and the high tariffs associated with higher consumption blocks. During water&#13;
shortages, the prices are even higher, soaring to Ksh 5 or even Ksh 10 per jerrycan.&#13;
&#13;
The utility historically had little incentive to address the problems in Kibera. This was because (a) revenue collection in the&#13;
settlement was negligible; (b) there were many illegal connections; and (c) the water delivered to Kibera was estimated to&#13;
be less than 10 percent of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s total consumption. Instead, the utility simply used water rationing to limit its losses.&#13;
Until recently, the utility considered kiosk operators to be part of the problem and driving them out of business was seen&#13;
as an effective measure to reduce unaccounted-for-water.&#13;
&#13;
In May 2004, following an intervention by WSPâ&#128;&#147;Africa, kiosk operators decided to form an association, which they called&#13;
Maji Bora Kibera (MBK), Swahili for â&#128;&#152;Better water services for Kiberaâ&#128;&#153;. They drafted a constitution, formed an executive&#13;
committee, and applied for official registration. Soon a joint task force was formed with members from the utility, MBK,&#13;
and WSPâ&#128;&#147;Africa. At the suggestion of the utility, the MBK wrote a letter stating clearly the problems faced by water&#13;
vendors and offering to cooperate with the regularization of their connections, pay bills regularly, stop paying bribes,&#13;
report leakages, and expand service to unserved areas. The utility was asked to provide a regular supply of water, adopt&#13;
better billing and collection practices, and provide engineering advice for network improvements. The letter was a&#13;
watershed in vendor-utility relations. The MBK and the utility continue to build their relationship. The MBK is working on a&#13;
number of initiatives to strengthen self-regulation and address the remaining barriers to good services.&#13;
&#13;
While there remains some concern that the association could be an obstacle to long-term change in Kibera (if the&#13;
members were to protect their own interests at the expense of consumers), there is also a recognition that both the utility&#13;
and vendors can gain from further collaboration.&#13;

        Box 5: Community-Managed Services in Tegucigalpa, Honduras&#13;
&#13;
        About 380,000 people live in poor peri-urban areas of Tegucigalpa. One-third of these peri-urban residents do not have&#13;
        direct access to the water supply network and most do not have access to sewerage. Many of the peri-urban settlements&#13;
        cannot be connected because of the topography (hillsides with steep slopes and unstable terrain), others because of their&#13;
        illegal status, and some because of the lack of adequate resources to extend the network. Residents of these areas obtain&#13;
        water from a number of sources, including tankers, rainwater catchments, and community wells.&#13;
&#13;
        With the assistance of several international development agencies and nongovernmental organizations, the National&#13;
        Autonomous Water and Sewerage Service (SANAA) is introducing alternative water and sanitation systems in these areas.&#13;
        These systems receive bulk water from SANAA or its tankers but are managed internally by the community. Three water&#13;
        supply models are used. The preferred model involves a metered connection to SANAAâ&#128;&#153;s network that feeds a community&#13;
        storage tank, to which the secondary network within the community is connected. Where connection to the network is not&#13;
        feasible, the community storage tank is supplied by tankers. The third option is a rainwater catchment and filtering system.&#13;
&#13;
        A revolving fund is used to finance construction and the beneficiary community repays the fund at zero interest over 5 to 10&#13;
        years. Communities that wish to benefit from this program must establish a water administration board with four officers&#13;
        selected by the community. The water boards operate and maintain the system, collect fees from the users to cover their&#13;
        own costs as well as the bulk water charges and the capital cost. They organize committees and engage staff to maintain&#13;
        the system, operate community water taps, collect fees, and prevent theft. Committees are also established to educate the&#13;
        community about water use and hygiene.&#13;

        Box 6: Dedicated Units in Water Utilities (Hyderabad and Bengaluru)&#13;
&#13;
        Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board created a Single Window Cell to receive, process, and&#13;
        coordinate water and sewerage connection applications. The Single Window Cell distributes a detailed two-page brochure&#13;
        that clearly explains the application procedures. A dedicated team of staff and contract laborers installs all approved new&#13;
        connections for which payment has been received. These reforms have reduced the time required to process connections&#13;
        from six months to three months and have significantly increased the number of applications processed.&#13;
        The Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board has a Social Development Unit, which focuses on connecting&#13;
        households in slums to piped water and sewerage. This unit is headed by a proactive senior development specialist who&#13;
        interacts directly and effectively with community groups, nongovernmental organizations, and influential individuals to&#13;
        promote communication, implement connection programs, resolve complaints, and so on. The Social Development Unit&#13;
        also uses NGOs as intermediaries to assist households with the application process and facilitate communications. To&#13;
        promote connections, the unit has introduced a reduced connection fee and simplified connection procedures. It also&#13;
        accepts â&#128;&#152;proof of occupancyâ&#128;&#153; in lieu of the requirement for land tenure. Residents of slums are encouraged to connect to&#13;
        the Boardâ&#128;&#153;s water supply system and are actively discouraged from resorting to illegal means. Connection charges vary on&#13;
        the basis of house size: Rs 550 (US$12)11 for houses of less than 150 square feet, Rs 800 (US$17) for houses of 150â&#128;&#147;600&#13;
        square feet, and the full rate of Rs 1,800 (US$39) for houses over 600 square feet. Slum dwellers are allowed to pay the&#13;
        connection charges in two installments.&#13;

      Box 7: Engaging Local Private Operators for Water Supply and Sanitation Services&#13;
&#13;
      Contracts with private operators, if well designed and appropriately monitored, can be an effective way to introduce&#13;
      autonomy and accountability. Until recently, tenders for private operators of water supply and sewerage services were&#13;
      aimed at large international firms, but in a number of countries tenders are increasingly aimed at local private operators,&#13;
      particularly in small towns with 10,000 to 50,000 residents. The experiences of Colombia and Paraguay (where, since&#13;
      2001 and 2002, respectively, local firms have been engaged to operate water supply services in large urban or&#13;
      peri-urban areas with poor populations) may be relevant to large cities in India.&#13;
      In Colombia, the poor performance of services operated by local governments led to the decision to engage private&#13;
      operators. In Paraguay, it was the high cost of subsidies required for investments and the failure of user associations to&#13;
      set tariffs high enough to repay loans for capital investments that led to the decision. In both countries local private&#13;
      operators have been engaged to construct or rehabilitate the infrastructure and operate the service for 15 to 20 years.&#13;
      In Colombia, most of the operators are companies with experience in providing other urban services, such as solid&#13;
      waste management. In Paraguay, large construction companies have sought the contracts but the government usually&#13;
      engages an experienced small local private operator (aguatero) to manage operations once construction is complete. In&#13;
      both countries, it is estimated that private operators are contributing about 20 percent of capital costs. The remainder is&#13;
      financed by grants from the national or local governments, using their own funds or the proceeds of World Bank loans.&#13;
      In Colombia, the municipal government contracts the private operator. In Paraguay, they are contracted by community-&#13;
      based user associations. In both cases, the national governments provide support to the local entities during the&#13;
      preparation and procurement process but the local entities assume full responsibility for day-to-day supervision of the&#13;
      operators. While competition for the contracts was somewhat limited in Colombia (only one or two bidders), it was&#13;
      strong in Paraguay (four to eight bidders). The contracts include very specific service targets that the operators are&#13;
      required to achieve. In both countries a national regulator specifies formulas and rules for setting tariffs.&#13;
      The contracts were in their early stages at the time they were reviewed in 2005, but initial results were mostly positive.&#13;
      In both countries, previously unserved neighborhoods were getting connections. In Paraguay, the cost of government&#13;
      investment subsidies had been cut in half. One of the lessons learned in Paraguay was that user associations need&#13;
      intensive training and support initially to ensure proper monitoring and a healthy relationship with the operator. In&#13;
      addition, user associations that receive a small percentage of the operatorsâ&#128;&#153; tariff revenues are most likely to provide&#13;

Box 8: Successful Performance and Incentive Contracts in a Public Company:&#13;
Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s National Water and Sewerage Corporation&#13;
&#13;
The National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) is an autonomous state company that provides water and&#13;
sewerage services in the larger towns and cities of Uganda. Until 1998, in the absence of an effective accountability&#13;
framework, the NWSC had made a number of poorly conceived investments. The company was very inefficient and&#13;
financially unsustainable: its fixed assets were underutilized, 51 percent of water was unaccounted for, it was grossly&#13;
overstaffed, and it was unable to service its debt. In 1998, a new general manager began to introduce performance&#13;
incentive programs and a client-oriented culture with a strong emphasis on service quality. Substantial improvements&#13;
resulted, but by 2000 it was clear that achieving financial sustainability would take several more years of effort. In 2000, the&#13;
Government of Uganda and the NWSC agreed to a three-year performance contract under which the latterâ&#128;&#153;s debt service&#13;
obligations were suspended in return for continued performance improvements.&#13;
&#13;
The performance contract specified the actions that the NWSC must take and the targets it was expected to meet with&#13;
regard to a number of key operational and financial indicators. A Performance Contract Review Committee was&#13;
established to monitor and report on the NWSCâ&#128;&#153;s performance. In 2003, the Review Committee found that the NWSC had&#13;
performed very well with regard to qualitative targets such as updating the asset registers, introducing incentive contracts&#13;
with its area managers, and outsourcing noncore activities. It had met or come close to meeting quantitative targets for&#13;
collection efficiency, connections, metering, and staff per 1,000 connections, but had fallen short with regard to financial&#13;
performance, and remained unable to service debt. Nevertheless, the performance contract and the internal management&#13;
initiatives that had been introduced had established a solid foundation for further improvements.&#13;
&#13;
The government and the NWSC entered into a second performance contract for 2003â&#128;&#147;06, which introduced more&#13;
meaningful financial indicators based on ratios rather than absolute results. In 2003, the NWSC also began to introduce an&#13;
innovative strategy for improving its area managersâ&#128;&#153; accountability and autonomy. In January 2004, following an internal&#13;
competitive bidding process in which all area managers were allowed to participate, two-year Internally Delegated&#13;
Management Contracts were awarded for all NWSC service areas.&#13;
&#13;
By 2004, as a result of consistent improvements in operations and cash management, the NWSCâ&#128;&#153;s revenues exceeded&#13;
operating costs (including depreciation) for the first time and the company was on the road to financial sustainability.&#13;
Compared to its performance in 1998, coverage in the NWSCâ&#128;&#153;s service areas increased from 48 percent in 1998 to&#13;
                                                                        68 percent in 2006. Total connections increased&#13;
                                                                        from 50,826 to 125,000. Unaccounted-for-water&#13;
                                                                        was down to 31 percent (35 percent in Kampala and&#13;
                                                                        16 percent in other service areas). Annual turnover&#13;

&amp;#12;      Box 9: Regulation by Contract: The Senegal Lease Contract&#13;
&#13;
      In 1995, the Government of Senegal launched wide-reaching reforms in the urban water sector. The state-run water&#13;
      company was dissolved; a new asset-holding company, SONES, was created, and a private operator was engaged to run&#13;
      the systems. These reforms resulted in significantly better services and financial health for the sector. The contractual&#13;
      framework included a concession contract and a sector development contract between the government and SONES, and&#13;
      a contract with the private operator. This 10-year affermage (usually referred to as a â&#128;&#152;lease contractâ&#128;&#153; in Englishâ&#128;&#148;though it&#13;
      is not really an accurate translation) was innovative in that it provided financial incentives for the private operator to achieve&#13;
      ambitious performance targets for leakage reduction, improvements in billing, and collection efficiency.&#13;
      The regulatory framework was built into the contract and was coherent (that is, it linked service levels to tariffs), credible,&#13;
      and transparent. SONESâ&#128;&#153;s monitoring capacity was strengthened through a practical training workshop early in the&#13;
      contract period, and an objective outside conciliateur was engaged when needed to verify performance and resolve&#13;
      conflicts. (Figure 3 illustrates these arrangements.) The operatorâ&#128;&#153;s remuneration was based on its performance and,&#13;
      although it was independent of the tariff, the government committed to gradually increasing tariffs to the full cost recovery&#13;
      level (including debt service) and had a strong incentive to respect this commitment because it was essential to ensure the&#13;
      financial health of the sector and expand services. Tariffs for water supply were increased about 3 percent (in real terms)&#13;
      per year over 1996â&#128;&#147;2002.&#13;
      Several factors contributed to the success of the reform: the use of an appropriate form of contract that was tailored to&#13;
      local conditions; strong political will and good leadership within the government; a well-designed process; and flexibility&#13;
      and innovation when it was needed. Design and preparation included the development of a financial model that could be&#13;
      used to set and revise performance targets, project revenue requirements, and calculate the associated tariff increases.&#13;
      Good relationships among the parties and an effective dispute resolution process meant that the private operator and the&#13;
      state asset-holding company were able to reach an agreement on how the former was reimbursed for lost earnings when&#13;
      the latter experienced a delay in the completion of investments.&#13;
      The reform has had positive outcomes for the poor, in part due to the nature of the operatorâ&#128;&#153;s incentives, and in part due&#13;
      to the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s policy of subsidizing connections in low-income neighborhoods. However, in 2004, some issues still&#13;
      remained due to the tariff inequities that result when multiple households use a single connection, and the fact that&#13;
      nonpoor households were benefiting from the subsidized block of the tariff, especially if they consumed no more than&#13;
      10 cubic meters of water per month.&#13;

     Citizenâ&#128;&#153;s Charter, and Grievance Resolution System&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     In 1998, the managing director of Hyderabad Metropolitan Water launched the Customer Meets Campaign, a&#13;
     two-week initiative intended to improve employeesâ&#128;&#153; commitment to customer care. During the campaign, senior&#13;
     managers held meetings with customers to learn about their service needs and concerns. The diversity and number of&#13;
     citizens who turned up, the directness of their grievances, and the gratitude they expressed for the opportunity to voice&#13;
     their concerns made an impression on management. As a follow-up to these meetings, the Metro Customer Care (MCC)&#13;
     office was created in February 1999 to receive and coordinate responses to complaints lodged by customers using a&#13;
     dedicated telephone number. The MCC standardized and simplified procedures for lodging grievances. An online&#13;
     computer-based program monitors staff performance in responding to complaints. The Citizenâ&#128;&#153;s Charter, launched by the&#13;
     Chief Minister in January 2000, outlines measurable service delivery norms for services provided by the Water Board. Its&#13;
     publication was a landmark, as it publicly acknowledged the Water Boardâ&#128;&#153;s commitment to improving service delivery.&#13;
     Evaluation of results show that the MCCâ&#128;&#153;s contribution has improved response to complaints for all income groups and a&#13;
     majority (96 percent) of MCC customers surveyed found procedures easy to follow. However, the MCC is not specifically&#13;
     aimed at the poor and the number of complaints from poor customers is not commensurate with their numbers, perhaps&#13;
     because they lack access to telephones or because they are less exacting than more affluent customers. Nineteen&#13;
     percent of slum residents reported that the complaint mechanism was more accessible than in the past and 44 percent&#13;
     found it more polite and respectful.&#13;

associated with requiring users to                                    based aid (OBA). The OBA approach                                     are presented in Box 12.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Box 12: Targeting Investment Subsidies for the Poor in Cambodia, Colombia,&#13;
    Paraguay, the Philippines, and Uganda&#13;
&#13;
    The governments of Colombia, Cambodia, Paraguay, the Philippines, and Uganda used the proceeds of World Bank loans or&#13;
    International Development Association (IDA) credits to expand and improve water services for the poor while promoting the&#13;
    engagement of private operators. In most cases in Colombia, Cambodia, the Philippines, and Paraguay, private operators&#13;
    were selected via a competitive process in which they specified the investment subsidy they required. In some of these, the&#13;
    subsidy was specified as lump sum investment, in others as an output-based aid subsidy per connection. In either case, the&#13;
    subsidy is paid after the investments are completed or customers are connected. These operators are required to operate&#13;
    the systems under contracts that resemble concessions or lease contracts for 10 to 25 years, and are responsible for all&#13;
    maintenance and replacements during that period. The subsidy is not intended to cover the full cost of construction; the&#13;
    unsubsidized portion is recouped from users through connection fees and tariffs over the life of the contract.&#13;
&#13;
    In Colombia, tariff rules require that the average tariff includes the full cost of replacement of assets even if the initial&#13;
    investments are subsidized and there is no debt service. However, the tariff structure is such that low-income households do&#13;
    not pay any charges for capital investments. Nonpoor consumers pay tariffs that cover the full replacement cost of&#13;
    infrastructure and those in the two highest income brackets pay, in addition, a surcharge to subsidize consumers in the two&#13;
    lowest income brackets. In this way, the higher income consumers do not benefit from the investment subsidies.&#13;
&#13;
    In Uganda, the government planned and bid-out the construction and operation of water supply systems for small towns&#13;
    separately from contracts with private managers. The investments were largely funded by government grants using donor&#13;
    credits or grants and tariffs are expected to cover only operation and maintenance costs. Since almost all residents of small&#13;
    towns are considered poor, all benefited more or less equally from the investment subsidy. However, the towns were required&#13;
    to mobilize a portion of the construction cost and the relatively more affluent residents were generally required to contribute&#13;
    more than less affluent residents. Tariffs cover the cost of operation and maintenance. Uganda is now planning a pilot project&#13;
    under which private firms would both construct and operate the systems and would receive an output-based aid subsidy&#13;
    per connection.&#13;

   It is worth noting that OBA investment subsidies are sometimes referred to as connection subsidies because they are paid on the basis of the number of connections installed. This is a misnomer&#13;
because the subsidy is usually intended to cover the cost of the major system components, not individual connections per se. In many OBA projects, the users must still pay a connection charge.&#13;

   Box 14: Condominial Sewerage in Brasilia&#13;
&#13;
   Between 1993 and 2001, Brasiliaâ&#128;&#153;s water and sewerage utility CAESB applied the condominial model on a massive scale&#13;
   in both low-income peri-urban neighborhoods and in more affluent areas of the capital. An estimated 188,000&#13;
   condominial connections benefiting 680,000 people were installed. Sewerage treatment capacity was also increased&#13;
   using adapted technologies.&#13;
&#13;
   Substantial cost savings resulted from several alternative technical practices. For example, in Santa Maria, a large&#13;
   neighborhood that typifies the system as a whole, the average public network length is about 2.8 meters per connection,&#13;
   compared with about 5.6 meters per connection for conventional systems. In addition, whereas conventional network&#13;
   design usually calls for a minimum pipe diameter of 150 millimeters, pipes of 100 millimeters were used for 56 percent of&#13;
   the system. The pipes were also laid at a minimum depth of 0.5 meters, compared to the conventional 1.0 to 1.3 meters,&#13;
   and simple inspection chambers were installed instead of high-cost manholes for 84 percent of the inspection points.&#13;
&#13;
   Throughout the metropolis, the condominial branches conformed strictly to standards of pipe location, hydraulic capacity&#13;
   material specifications, and building regulations, but a few exceptions were made to accommodate highly localized&#13;
   physical conditions. Residents at the level of each condominium were allowed to choose among three location options for&#13;
   the branch routes: through the backyard, the front yard or under the sidewalk. Routing through the yard has the&#13;
   advantage of being less expensive to install, but the household is responsible for maintenance. With the more expensive&#13;
   option of routing under the sidewalk comes the advantage that the utility assumes responsibility for maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
   As the cost of condominial branches (US$2.8 million) was borne by the beneficiaries, CAESBâ&#128;&#153;s costs (US$1.7 million)&#13;
   were much lower than for conventional sewerage. However, it was estimated that consumers paid no more for the&#13;
   condominial branches than they would have paid for conventional connections. About 1.5 percent of households opted to&#13;
   install the branches themselves and consequently paid no connection charge, but were expected to pay for materials.&#13;
   Finally, the regular sewerage charges for households that opted for routing through the yard were discounted&#13;
   by 40 percent.&#13;
&#13;
   Prior to undertaking investments, CAESB undertook a process of social intermediation. During a series of meetings, the&#13;
   approach was explained and each community chose an option and signed the required agreements. This process did not&#13;
   result in any delays in the execution of the works. In lower-income communities, especially, the mobilization efforts led to&#13;
   greater contact among neighbors and built social capital.&#13;
&#13;
   The alternative technical practices have resulted in neither a higher incidence of obstructions nor a higher cost of&#13;
   maintenance relative to the pre-existing conventional system.&#13;

Summary of&#13;
Policy Issues&#13;
&amp;#12; Improvements in the planning and delivery of services are essential to&#13;
 promote more efficient use of water resources, but must be complemented&#13;
 by an effective framework for overall water resources management.&#13;

            India - Improving water supply and
            sanitation services for the urban poor in India
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In 2006-07, the Water and Sanitation
            Program-South Asia (WSP-SA) initiated research to identify
            barriers to service delivery for the urban poor. The
            findings of the research have been presented in these
            Guidance Notes. They provide a systematic analysis of the
            barriers to service delivery for the urban poor and
            recommend practical solutions and strategies for overcoming
            these barriers. The Guidance Notes are based on an in-depth
            research of various initiatives from across the world
            (including South Asian, African, and Latin American
            countries) and consultations with urban poor communities
            across four major Indian cities (Mumbai, Bengaluru,
            Vadodara, and Delhi). The purpose of this report is to
            identify barriers to providing adequate services for the
            poor and to propose practical solutions based on the
            experience of a number of relevant cases that have been
            reviewed for this purpose. These Guidance Notes focus on
            practical actions - many of which can be implemented at
            least partially within the existing framework. Desirable
            policy initiatives are listed at the end of each section and
            a final section summarizes them.
