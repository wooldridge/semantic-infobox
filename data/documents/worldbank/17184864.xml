&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-5-&#13;
B. Background and Objectives&#13;
High quality fInancial reporting makes a direct contribution to improving the lives&#13;
of people and reducing poverty. As a result of the timely provision of reliable information&#13;
about the financial position and performance of enterprises, enhanced confidence is&#13;
brought to the relationship betw%een enterprises (in both the real and the financial sectors,&#13;
including state owned enterprise s) and their stakeholders. This facilitates improved levels&#13;
of overnance and transparency, fosters the development of an enabling business&#13;
environment and investment cli:nate, and underpins more effective relationships between&#13;
the corporate sector and the state. In turn, these developments support enhanced&#13;
mobilization of domestic and foreign savings, improved access to credit, higher levels of&#13;
priN ate-sector-led growth, and the development of financial and capital markets.&#13;
Economic growth, combined with equity, is a key contributor to improving people's lives&#13;
and the fight against poverty. As has been reconfirmed in recent years by the financial&#13;
crisis, inadequacies in financia. reporting increase the risk of financial instability, the&#13;
consequences of which are fe t disproportionately by the poor, so improvements in&#13;
financial reporting are an essertial element of any public policy response to the crisis.&#13;
Finally, as issues relating to financial reporting form an important element of the&#13;
European Union's body of law, the acquis communautaire, improvements in this field are&#13;
of major importance to both (ounries seeking EU membership as well as countries&#13;
seeking closer relations and inte gration with the EU.&#13;
The objective of the Rc ad to Europe Program for Accounting and Institutional&#13;
Strengthening Multi.-Donor Trust Fund ("REPARIS MDTF") is to support the&#13;
implementation of bcth regional anJ country-specific activities with a view to tackling&#13;
issues shared by Beneficiary Countries, to promote cooperation among them, and to&#13;
ensure coordinated actions with.n a common framework, while facilitating financing and&#13;
implementation support to the cointries in their endeavors to implement financial&#13;
reporting reforms at tie nationa level as set out in their respective CAPs. The REPARIS&#13;
METF aims to achieve the following results:&#13;
(a)   updated regulatory frameworks for corporate financial reporting within the&#13;
countries, that achieve greater degrees of alignment with the relevant EC&#13;
acquis communautaire, and that are proportional to the country's&#13;
integration with the EU. -&#13;
(b)   an increase in Icng term partnerships with, or memberships of, relevant&#13;
EU ard/or globil peer organizations to achieve sustainability of the&#13;
accourting educ itior. reforms; an increase in the number of countries&#13;
implementing o - algning themselves with the EU Statutory Audit&#13;
Directive auditor education requirements; and an increase in the number of&#13;
studen:s who are provided with the opportunity to access modern updated&#13;
undergraduate ac-ourting and auditing education courses.&#13;
(c)   availability of updated and translated standards in the languages of the&#13;
Benefi-iary Countries; financial reporting and statutory audit (and public&#13;
.oversight) arrangements that are better aligned with the requirements of&#13;
the EC acquis communautaire; a technical support system that will enable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-6-&#13;
more effective i:nplementing and enforcement arrangements throughout&#13;
the Region; ard more effective regulation of financial reporting&#13;
requircments by ])rudential supervisors.&#13;
(d)   performance maniagement system for corporate financial reporting reform&#13;
activities and a web-based portal containing a repository of information&#13;
provid.ng advice, tools, and methodologies to support ongoing&#13;
implementation cf the relevant acquis.&#13;
The REPARIS MDTF ond its activities provide a framework to ensure a strong&#13;
integration of assessment, advis ry, financial, operational, and monitoring and evaluation&#13;
(M&amp;E) support to achieve alignment with the requirements of the acquis communautaire&#13;
in the field of corporate reporting, ard seeks to:&#13;

and Auditing.    Facilitate  efforts to  reform  and upgrade&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-7-&#13;
accounting elucation systems by focusing on the common&#13;
challenge3 faced by universities, professional accounting bodies,&#13;
chambers of auditors, and regulators. There is a substantial&#13;
commonality of curriculum content, qualification systems and&#13;
lifelong learning requirements that can be applied throughout the&#13;
countries of the Region to support the relevant stakeholder&#13;
institutior.s. The implementation of International Accounting&#13;
Educatior Standards, application of the education requirements of&#13;
the EU Statutory Audit Directive, and identification and replication&#13;
of the e&gt; periences of developed EU universities in accounting&#13;
education are amongst the aims which have been set by the&#13;
Accounting Education CoP. The CFRR will work with the CoP on&#13;
the development of identified common approaches and solutions to&#13;
the shared challenges, as well as facilitate collaboration with EU&#13;
and relevant global peer institutions and bodies.&#13;
Expected outputs include a series of regular videoconferences&#13;
utilizing tae World Bank's Global Development Learning Network&#13;
(GDLN) and CoP workshops. The CFRR will provide technical&#13;
assistance to the CoP to facilitate the development of an e-based&#13;
information and resources portal that will allow universities,&#13;
professional bodies and regulators to access educational resources&#13;
and tool; to support their development and implementation&#13;
activities. The CFRR will work to increase the capacity CoP&#13;
participant institutions to engage with their EU and global peers,&#13;
such as the International Federation of Accountants, the Federation&#13;
of Europe an Accountants, the International Forum of Independent&#13;
Audit RegulatDrs, and EU universities.&#13;
(iii)  Moving J'ormard in Accounting and Auditing. Provide technical&#13;

(IFRS), 1he enforcement of financial reporting requirements,&#13;
improving the quality of audits through the introduction of quality&#13;
assurance systems, and the introduction of public oversight&#13;
arrangem,mts for the statutory audit function. The Region faces&#13;
the challenge of providing access to updated translated versions of&#13;
internatio ial standards, and shortages of highly skilled and&#13;
experienced professionals to implement and enforce these. Work&#13;
under th s component will be coordinated with that of the&#13;
Accounting Education CoP to identify and facilitate the&#13;
development of sharable solutions to these needs through&#13;
continuoL s professional education. The CFRR will also continue&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

both the Financial Reporting and Audit and Oversight CoP(s), and&#13;
support for their work through providing technical assistance,&#13;
guidance and appropriate linkages with EU and relevant global&#13;
peers. E)pected outputs also include the provision of training&#13;
seminars in IFRS and prudential requirements for central banks&#13;
and financial sector regulators in the Region, and the creation of an&#13;
information e-portal that will enable the training and technical&#13;
outputs t) be made available throughout the Region. Specific&#13;
technical guidance that is relevant to the thematic areas addressed&#13;
under this component will be developed and disseminated, such as&#13;
a Guide to tie accounting and auditing aspects of the acquis&#13;
communawtaire. The CFRR will also continue to encourage and&#13;
facilitate 1he use of the CoP(s) to provide peer-learning case clinics&#13;
for countries facing immediate specific challenges in financial&#13;
reporting or auditing.&#13;

DAC members contrIbuting to REPARIS may provide comments on the&#13;
proposed work p an and budget and these may be discussed with the Bank&#13;
prior to the apprcval of annual work plan and budget.&#13;
The CFRR decides the activities to be funded from the REPARIS MDTF&#13;
in accordance with strategic guidance from DAC and the related demand&#13;
from Beneficiary Countries, and taking into account recommendations of&#13;
RLG and MPG and budget constraints. The CFRR reports to DAC on the&#13;
progre:3s in implementation of the MDTF annual work plan.&#13;
In the capacity of secretariat to the REPARIS MDTF, the CFRR will (a)&#13;
assist he Beneficiary Countries in raising adequate funding to support&#13;
implementation of their respective CAPs; (b) administer funds provided&#13;
by development partrers in support of implementation of both the regional&#13;
and country specific activities under the REPARIS MDTF; and (c) report&#13;

emerging best practice; on the coordination of relevant capacity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-11-&#13;
developrrent activities by RLG members with those of the Centre;&#13;
and on the extent and sequencing of the adoption and&#13;
implemer tation of EU and international best practice in the&#13;
specific :ircLmstances of the CFRR's partner countries. The&#13;
involveme-nt of these organizations in the RLG is also expected to&#13;
facilitate the ability of the CFRR to mobilize their specific&#13;
assistancc in t-e context of individual programs and projects.&#13;
(ii)  Market Participants Group.      On the basis of structured&#13;
consultations and periodic reports by the CFRR on what are&#13;
considered to be the main areas of financial reporting in need of&#13;
reform, the practical views of the MPG are sought on the key&#13;
impedimnts to high quality financial reporting in the CFRR's&#13;
partner countries, and on the extent of progress being achieved&#13;
over timc. The involvement of these entities in the MPG is also&#13;
expected to facilitate the raising of private sector funding to&#13;
support the activities of the CFRR, and the ability of the CFRR to&#13;
mobilize their specific assistance at country level in making the&#13;
case for f nancial reporting reform.&#13;
