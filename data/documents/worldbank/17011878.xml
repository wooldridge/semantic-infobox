    Using Mobile Phones to Strengthen&#13;
    Outcome Monitoring in Rural Sanitation&#13;
&#13;
    The monitoring of usage of sanitation facilities at scale in the     real time, incorporate features such as geo-tagging and&#13;
    rural areas is a continuing challenge. Usage of the facilities,      photographs to make results more credible and relevant, and&#13;
    as against construction, is a behavior which requires frequent       make presentation of data as user-friendly maps to enable&#13;
    cross checks over relatively shorter time spans; in addition,        quick grasp of the status. The process can be replicated at&#13;
    the costs involved are high in terms of money, effort, and           large scale and at periodic intervals, to address the gaps in the&#13;
    time. Making information available in real time to feed              monitoring of usage of sanitation facilities in rural areas.&#13;
    back into policy and implementation decision making has&#13;
    been difficult.                                                      Introduction&#13;
                                                                         Although India is now included in the front ranks of rapidly&#13;
    The use of Information and Communication Technology                  growing emerging economies, it is also paradoxically home&#13;
    (ICT), through the use of mobile phones, to collect data             to the majority of people defecating in the open in the world&#13;
    on sanitation behavior and make available almost real time           (Joint Monitoring Program 2010). It is estimated that one&#13;
    data, offers potential at large scale. A proof of concept was        in every 10 deaths in India is linked to poor sanitation&#13;
    piloted to test the viability of using mobile technology             and hygiene (Water and Sanitaion Program [WSP] 2011).&#13;
    to strengthen monitoring in the rural sanitation sector              Diarrhea, a preventable disease, is the largest killer and&#13;
    in two blocks (sub districts) of varying socioeconomic               accounts for every 20th death (Ibid). Diarrhea is linked to&#13;
    characteristics. The pilot covered 23,000 households in a            malnutrition, especially in children, and India has one of&#13;
    span of two to three months.                                         the highest rates of child malnutrition in the world, nearly&#13;
                                                                         double that of sub-Saharan Africa (Gragnolati et al 2005).&#13;
    This proof of concept demonstrated that using smartphones            To address this sanitation challenge, the Government of&#13;
    can provide quick, credible information outcomes in near             India (GoI) has invested heavily in programs to achieve&#13;

&#13;
          Lessons learnt from piloting the proof of concept&#13;
&#13;
               â&#128;¢	 Proof-of-concept pilot was able to gather data and present information on important parameters (less than 10)&#13;
                  from about 23,000 households in two sample blocks (sub districts) in about three months;&#13;
&#13;
               â&#128;¢	 Photographs of the respondents, though met with hesitation from some respondents, and geo-tagging of&#13;
                  household locations, ensured high level of quality control of information;&#13;
&#13;
               â&#128;¢	 Geo tags were also useful in showing results on maps at a glance; and&#13;
&#13;
               â&#128;¢	 Technological challenges included battery draining quickly, necessitating frequent recharge, poor general packet&#13;
                  radio service (GPRS) connectivity in some areas.&#13;

    large national rural sanitation campaigns,2 the goal of an                               1), which means that the usage of those villages that do not&#13;

    elusive. To ensure investments in sanitation lead to                                     adapt to what is measured, and there is a gap between the&#13;
    commensurate outcomes, the sector needs a reliable and timely                            sanitation coverage figures provided by routine monitoring&#13;
    monitoring system.                                                                       (around 76 percent of rural households have access to a&#13;
                                                                                             toilet, GoI 2011) and the actual usage of these toilets tracked&#13;
    The present monitoring system is geared towards tracking of                              by surveys undertaken every few years (around 45 percent of&#13;
    inputs such as budget spent and outputs in terms of toilets                              rural households actually use toilets, International Institute&#13;
    constructed. The key outcomeâ&#128;&#148;usage of toiletsâ&#128;&#148;is tracked                                 for Population Sciences [IIPS] 2008) (see Figure 1).&#13;
&#13;
          Box 1: Monitoring in the Indian Rural Sanitation Sector	&#13;
&#13;
             There are three main sources of information on the rural sanitation sector in India:&#13;
&#13;
             1.	 Routine Data Collection: This refers to administrative data collected by the Management Information System&#13;
                 (MIS) of the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC), a 12-year program launched by GoI to achieve universal&#13;
                 sanitation coverage by 2012. The focus of such routine data collection tends to be on inputs such as budget&#13;
                 spent and outputs in terms of toilets constructed.&#13;
&#13;
             2.	 Incentive Program Monitoring: GoI and several state governments have introduced incentives or prizes to&#13;
                 motivate local governments to achieve community-wide total sanitation. These are based on third party survey&#13;
                 monitoring and focus on outcomes such as 100 percent household toilet usage and safe disposal of solid and&#13;
                 liquid waste. State government incentive programs are typically designed as annual competitions between local&#13;
                 governments and hence winners have to sustain total sanitation achievements in order to successfully compete&#13;
                 the following year. The national incentive program, however, is a one-time prize, awarded once a year, and&#13;
                 winners are only ever verified once at the time of application. Field assessments show that prize winners do&#13;
                 not necessarily sustain total sanitation achievements and one recent study found that access to toilets in prize&#13;
                 winning local governments varied from 47 to 100 percent (GoI 2011).&#13;
&#13;
             3.	 Surveys and Census: These are the most reliable source of information on sector outcomes such as toilet usage.&#13;
                 However, results of large scale surveys of rural households are available only every three to four years and the&#13;
                 Census is undertaken once in a decade.&#13;
&#13;
             Between the extremes of input/output tracking through monthly routine monitoring and outcome tracking through&#13;
             annual/multi-year surveys, a mechanism is needed to provide policymakers with reliable and timely information&#13;
             on sector progress. The process that this note demonstrates can contribute to the existing data collection in point&#13;
             no. 1 (routine data collection) as well as strengthen point no. 2 (incentive program monitoring).&#13;

    Monitoring Outcomes&#13;
    in Rural Sanitation&#13;
    Recent trends in the rural sanitation sector in India, and               â&#128;¢	 While monitoring infrastructure is a one-time&#13;
    across the world, have identified motivating sustainable                    activity with cross checks over longer time periods,&#13;
    behavior change rather than just creating infrastructure as                 monitoring behavior is a constant activity that&#13;
    the key outcome of a successful sanitation program. This                    requires frequent cross checks over relatively&#13;
    trend is rooted in the failures of conventional approaches                  shorter time spans;&#13;
    which were based on the assumption that once infrastructure              â&#128;¢	 The cost of monitoring, in terms of effort, time,&#13;
    is provided, behavior change will automatically ensue.                      and money, can be significant when done at scale&#13;
    Significant investments were made in constructing toilets in                and at high frequency. Even sample surveys make&#13;
    rural areas which ended up being put to various uses such                   data available on program outcomes often after it&#13;
    as bathrooms, store rooms, and so on.                                       is too late to make a mid-course correction; and&#13;
                                                                             â&#128;¢	 Quality control is also an issue when such&#13;
    That said, the focus on behavior change as the outcome                      monitoring is done at scale. Results, if they are&#13;
    of rural sanitation programs poses specific challenges for                  controversial, can end up being challenged on&#13;
    monitoring sector progress, namely:                                         methodological fronts.&#13;

    Proof of Concept: Using&#13;
    Mobile-to-Web Monitoring&#13;
    System in Rural Sanitation&#13;
    The proliferation of mobile phones in developing countries&#13;
    has outstripped the rate of improvements in basic service&#13;
    delivery in many cases, and India is no exception. ICT,&#13;
    especially mobile-to-web systems, have increasingly been&#13;
    used for improving service delivery. Some examples include&#13;
    motivating behavior change (advising pregnant women&#13;
    to take supplements) and customer interface (complaint&#13;
    redressal systems for water supply).&#13;
&#13;
    To test the viability of using mobile technology to&#13;
    strengthen monitoring in the rural sanitation sector, a&#13;
    proof of concept was piloted by WSP, through a company&#13;
    involved in technology for development (Oneworld&#13;
    Foundation). A pilot was initiated in two blocks (sub                  of sanitation facility used or whether practicing&#13;
    districts)â&#128;&#148;Rajgir block in Nalanda district of Bihar, one              open defecation;&#13;
    of the poorest states in India, and in Kandaghat block             4.	 In case the household includes a child under three&#13;
    in Solan district in Himachal Pradesh, a state which has               years, method of disposal of child feces; and&#13;
    traditionally performed well in terms of economic and              5.	 Material available for hand-washing&#13;
    human development indicators. The pilot covered the                    (observation question).&#13;
    entire rural population of the two blocks which is around&#13;
    23,000 households.                                             The application was designed to operate in the local language,&#13;
                                                                   Hindi, to collect information directly from rural households.&#13;
    The following steps were undertaken in piloting this proof     The collection process, using smartphones, incorporated two&#13;
    of concept.                                                    features to ensure the quality of the data:&#13;
&#13;
    Step 1: Development of                                             1. 	 Photograph of the respondent, with the toilet, if&#13;
    Outcome Tracker Application                                              available, or in front of the house; and&#13;
    The development of a mobile application, Outcome                    2. 	 Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates of the&#13;
    Tracker, was the first stage in the process. Since the focus             location where the data are uploaded to the server.&#13;
    was on collecting information on key outcomes linked&#13;
    to behavior change and given that mobiles were used            This removed any doubts as to whether a sanitation facility&#13;
    instead of conventional paper surveys, the number of           did indeed exist in a particular household and also ensured&#13;
    indicators was deliberately kept to a minimum. A final list    that enumerators had to visit different households. Stringent&#13;
    of five key indicators developed into the Outcome Tracker      quality controls included automatic flagging of records for&#13;
    application included:                                          back-check and also red flags on records that seemed to&#13;
                                                                   contain anomalous information, for example, the toilet is&#13;
        1.	 Economic status of the household (assessed through     not available but the respondent reported use of a toilet.&#13;
            whether a household has an Above or Below the&#13;
            Poverty Line ration card);                             A centralized MIS was designed to manage large datasets&#13;
        2.	 Whether the household has access to a toilet;          and consolidate the village data at the Panchayat and block&#13;
        3.	 Sanitation behavior of each member of a household,     levels. This data would then be available to be consolidated&#13;
            starting with the eldest usual resident, and type      and analyzed within a few minutes of its collection.&#13;

    couple of villages and a daily target rateâ&#128;&#148;30 households          team tracked the quality of incoming data and checked it for&#13;
    in Rajgir and 15 households in Kandaghat. The variance in         verification. A confirmation flag was sent back to the mobile&#13;
    target was due to the higher density of population in Rajgir      to acknowledge the receipt. In the absence of a GPRS, the data&#13;
    compared to Kandaghat. Appropriate quality controls with          were stored locally in handsets until they could be sent to the&#13;

     rural sanitation (a sector where India needs to improve        challenges facing household surveys:&#13;
     considerably), to enhance information available on service&#13;

            information on sector outcomes in near real time             from the respondents. There was a need to reassure the&#13;
            unlike that provided by conventional surveys;                respondents about the need of photographing and that&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 Features such as geo-tagging and photographs of              the information would be kept anonymous; and&#13;
            respondents ensure results are more credible and          â&#128;¢	 Initially, the low-end mobile phones used in the project&#13;

            Although India is now included in the
            front ranks of rapidly growing emerging economies, it is
            also paradoxically home to the majority of people defecating
            in the open in the world (joint monitoring program 2010). It
            is estimated that one in every 10 deaths in India is linked
            to poor sanitation and hygiene (Water and Sanitation Program
            (WSP) 2011). Diarrhea, a preventable disease, is the largest
            killer and accounts for every 20th death (Ibid). Diarrhea is
            linked to malnutrition, especially in children, and India
            has one of the highest rates of child malnutrition in the
            world, nearly double that of sub-Saharan Africa (Gragnolati
            et al 2005). To address this sanitation challenge, the
            Government of India (GoI) has invested heavily in programs
            to achieve universal sanitation coverage. However, despite
            two large national rural sanitation campaigns, the goals of
            an open defecation free India, a Nirmal Bharat, remains
            elusive. To ensure investments in sanitation lead to
            commensurate outcomes, the sector needs a reliable and
            timely monitoring system.
