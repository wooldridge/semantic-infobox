        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            High costs, poor economic performance
            associated with most forms of government interventions,
            large fiscal deficits and pressures to downsize the pubic
            sector, have led several developing and former centrally
            planned economies towards more market-oriented policies.
            These economies have highly concentrated industries, large
            state-owned sectors and/or inefficient firms operate in
            small markets insulated by trade barriers. Competition law
            will help them by strengthening market forces. Not only will
            the law help to lower costs and prices and increase consumer
            welfare, but it will foster sound business discipline,
            culture, and ethics -especially as state monopolies are
            being privatized. This important in a world economy which is
            becoming more integrated, where countries can no longer
            protect their industries without loss of profitable
            opportunities and international competitiveness. The author
            offers a framework for the design and implementation of
            competition law.
