&#13;
OLIVER: This is Robert Oliver about to have a conversation with Charles Bartlett about&#13;
George Woods, talking about some of the things which are perhaps not already&#13;
transcribed on our previous interview. This is July 23, 1985, at about 2 p.m. in the&#13;
afternoon. Since we have been talking about the subject already, let me ask you a sort of&#13;
strange question to begin a conversation with. What sort of frustrations did Mr. Woods&#13;
have at one time or another in your acquaintanceship with him for whatever reason or at&#13;
whatever time?&#13;
&#13;
BARTLETT: Well, I was in, had martinis with him after he came back to New York,&#13;
and we used to talk on the telephone at least once a week, generally on Sunday&#13;
afternoons. And the frustration that sort of emerged from those conversations was his&#13;
concern that the system wasnâ&#128;&#153;t really functioning well. I mean, he felt that we could be&#13;
doing a lot better than we were and that this was one of the reasons he agreed to join&#13;
some of us in this push for a single 6 year term. Even after he wasnâ&#128;&#153;t feeling well, he&#13;
would give some of his energy to this cause because he really believed that a single 6&#13;
year term for the President would have been a very great asset. He was there at the&#13;
founding meeting in the University Club in New York. I think it was the year that he&#13;
died. And we met, and he was on hand, and he was one of the luminaries. But George, I&#13;
think, was actually very disappointed in the [Jimmy] Carter Administration. I think he&#13;
was disappointed in the [Gerald R.] Ford Administration in the sense that the Republican&#13;
Party seemed to him so deferential to the right wing, particularly in its treatment of&#13;
Nelson Rockefeller. I think that the Republican Party really lost the sympathy of George&#13;
Woodsâ&#128;&#148;I mean, the way Nelson was sort of run unceremoniously, booted out of the&#13;
White House and booted out of the Vice Presidency by a moderate President and by&#13;
Donald Rumsfeld. I think it was aâ&#128;&#148;I think George thought that a pretty rough deal&#13;
which did not auger well for the future of the Republican Party. I never knew whether he&#13;
voted or not for Ronald Reagan in 1980. I also didnâ&#128;&#153;t ask him about that. I also know he&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#153;t have respect for Carter, but he could not have had much enthusiasm for Ronald&#13;
Reagan, coming as he did from the Rockefeller wing of the Republican Party.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Was his loyalty to the Rockefeller wing of the Republican Party a loyalty to&#13;
Nelson Rockefeller as a person or was it matter of kind of ideology?&#13;
&#13;
BARTLETT: I donâ&#128;&#153;t think Iâ&#128;&#153;d classify George Woods as a political liberal. I think Iâ&#128;&#153;d&#13;
call him a sort of a Republican progressive. I think that he would have been a Bull&#13;
Moose man if heâ&#128;&#153;d been around when Teddy Roosevelt was going, and I think that he&#13;
really had a great sense of the progressive potential in the Republican Party. I never&#13;
heard him attach himself as to a party, and I donâ&#128;&#153;t really know whether he was a&#13;
Democrat or a Republican. But he said he was a friend of [Dwight D.] Eisenhowerâ&#128;&#153;s, and&#13;
he certainly got along with [John F.] Kennedy. And he got along reasonably well with&#13;
Lyndon Johnson. So I think that there was a sort of an open-mindedness as opposed to a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

  Transcribed by the World Bank Oral History Project. Neither a tape nor a transcript of the previous&#13;
interview referred to in the first Oliver question has been located.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
party classification. But he did feel frustrated by events, the way that all of us did in the&#13;
period of the â&#128;&#152;70s.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did I understand in the earlier conversation with you that you had known&#13;
John Kennedy yourself?&#13;
&#13;
BARTLETT: John Kennedy and I were friends, yes, before I came to Washington.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Can you shed some light on the Kennedy-Woods relationship, the reason why&#13;
Kennedy appointed Woods President of the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
BARTLETT: I didnâ&#128;&#153;t know George Woods at that point and so therefore John&#13;
Kennedy never discussed with me his plan to bring him down to be President of the&#13;
World Bank. Douglas Dillon was the Secretary of the Treasury, and to me, just guessing&#13;
without knowing, I would suspect that Douglas Dillon was probably the one who&#13;
recommended him. I doubt whether any of the liberal types around Kennedy would have&#13;
done it. Ralph Dungan, I donâ&#128;&#153;t think so. I would imagine it came from Doug Dillon.&#13;
And I think thatâ&#128;&#148;it happened to be while Doug Dillon was the Secretary of the Treasury&#13;
so Iâ&#128;&#153;m almost certain it was Doug Dillon or maybe one of the subordinates in the&#13;
Treasury Department. If you need help on that, Iâ&#128;&#153;ll be glad to help.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Can you comment on Woodsâ&#128;&#153; relationships with the United States Treasury&#13;
Department in subsequent years, â&#128;&#152;64, â&#128;&#152;65, â&#128;&#153;66?&#13;
&#13;
BARTLETT: No, I really canâ&#128;&#153;t.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Those were times when the United States was very concerned about balance&#13;
of payments problems [inaudible] bonds, for instance, I should have thought that Woods&#13;
might have been frustrated in those days.&#13;
&#13;
BARTLETT: Yes, he must have been but he didnâ&#128;&#153;t discuss it with me. As a working&#13;
newspaperman, there was a difference in our relationship. In other words, he had to be&#13;
careful. I wasnâ&#128;&#153;t tuned in to the day to day problems that he was having down here. And&#13;
I think that theâ&#128;&#148;our discussions really became much broader after he left the office,&#13;
talking person to person.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: You mentioned in passing about the time the one term, 6 year movement was&#13;
getting started, he was a strong supporter, even though he was not feeling well. Can you&#13;
comment at all about his health, in the years during the Bank and after the Bank?&#13;
We know, for example, that he had an aneurysm in 1963. Some observed that he would&#13;
get tired in the afternoons beginning 6, 6:30, 7. Did you notice anything like this?&#13;
&#13;
BARTLETT: Well, I didnâ&#128;&#153;t. We talked about, you know, his experiences and it was&#13;
obvious that he formed a lifelong friendship with the doctor who took care of him out&#13;
there. He didnâ&#128;&#153;t talk about his health. I think it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t something that [inaudible]â&#128;&#148;I was&#13;
always talking about getting him to exercise. He was reluctant to exercise. We talked&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and joked a lot about that. He was quite proud of himself that--after his last problem we&#13;
talked about he began walking rather regularly. He gained some energy and walked&#13;
rather regularly and was very proud of himself. Exercise wasnâ&#128;&#153;t basically his inclination.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did you describe on the other tape that youâ&#128;&#153;ve already finished how you met&#13;
George Woods in the first place?&#13;
&#13;
BARTLETT: Yeah, I did.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And did you talk in that tape about the major desires that Mr. Woods had as&#13;
the President of the Bank, what kinds of things he wanted to accomplish, what visions he&#13;
had?&#13;
&#13;
BARTLETT: You see, we knew each other very little at that point so he wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t have&#13;
discussed his visions with me. In other words, he came in as a businessman to begin with&#13;
[inaudible] You know, I think that his approach to the Bank [inaudible] can tell you&#13;
much better than I could. As a person, the characteristic of George Woods was, â&#128;&#156;What&#13;
makes sense?â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
The greatness of the man, I think, was that he pulled away all the posturing and the sort&#13;
of illusions and all those things and really got down to, you know, â&#128;&#156;What is the sensible&#13;
thing to do?â&#128;? And I think that thatâ&#128;&#153;s why he was impressive. He had a good mind and he&#13;
cut through all the baloney. And the world was changing rather rapidly in the early â&#128;&#152;60s,&#13;
and Kennedy wanted to do a lot of things. And there was a sort of a foreign policy&#13;
consensus in this country and a much healthier state of mind than we have today when&#13;
you have everyone going every direction. There was a sort of a consensus that we had to&#13;
help India, we had to go out and get funds to help India, and we should to be a leader in&#13;
the effort. We had then more support, therefore, for multilateral systems than you have&#13;
today in foreign policy.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: So, after he left the Bank [inaudible], from time to time, did he think back on&#13;
his many experiences, comment on one way or another on what he thought had&#13;
happened?&#13;
&#13;
BARTLETT: Yes, he did, but always in reference to something that was developing at&#13;
the time. You know, he didnâ&#128;&#153;t reminisce out of hand.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: What other things should I be asking you?&#13;
&#13;
BARTLETT: Letâ&#128;&#153;s give you the tape and then you can-â&#128;&#147;you give a look at the transcript&#13;
and see. Then in the future if you want Iâ&#128;&#153;ll come back and we can talk some more. You&#13;
want to do that?&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Absolutely. Thank you for today.&#13;

&#13;
Addendum from Charles Bartlett&#13;
&#13;
As a journalist in Washington over 55 years, I have dealt with a great many who were&#13;
blessed with incisive minds and high motivations. George Woods is, however, unique in&#13;
my memory, and I believe this is because of the clarity of his thinking, the quality of his&#13;
warmth and humor, and the depth of his devotion to the nation.&#13;
