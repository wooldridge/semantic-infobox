THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT&#13;
For policy makers trying to improve their economyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW&#13;
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory&#13;
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides&#13;
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business&#13;
                                                               Region: Middle East &amp; North Africa&#13;
based on indicator sets that measure and benchmark&#13;
regulations applying to domestic small to medium-size          Income category: Lower middle income&#13;
businesses through their life cycle. Economies are ranked&#13;
from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 4,294,682&#13;
Doing Business presents results for 2 aggregate measures:&#13;
the distance to frontier score and the ease of doing           GNI per capita (US$): 1,735&#13;
business ranking. The ranking of economies is determined&#13;
by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 129&#13;
rounded to two decimals. An economyâ&#128;&#153;s distance to&#13;
frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 127*&#13;
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.&#13;
                                                               Change in rank: -2&#13;

The ease of doing business ranking compares economies&#13;
with one another; the distance to frontier score               DB 2015 DTF: 53.71&#13;

practice, showing the absolute distance to the best            Change in DTF: 1.12&#13;
performance on each Doing Business indicator. When&#13;
compared across years, the distance to frontier score          * DB2015 ranking shown is not last yearâ&#128;&#153;s published&#13;

entrepreneurs in an economy has changed over time in           captures the effects of such factors as data revisions&#13;
absolute terms, while the ease of doing business ranking       and the changes in methodology. See the data notes&#13;
can show only how much the regulatory environment has          starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016&#13;
changed relative to that in other economies.                   report for sources and definitions.&#13;

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on&#13;
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and&#13;
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,&#13;
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are&#13;
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the&#13;
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.&#13;

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last yearâ&#128;&#153;s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such&#13;
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest&#13;
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory&#13;
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific areaâ&#128;&#148;for example, insolvencyâ&#128;&#148;it&#13;
receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark. Similarly, an economy receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark if regulatio n exists but is never used in practice or if a&#13;
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the&#13;

      Hire independent syndicate engineer to review and approve&#13;
      building plans and supervise construction&#13;
&#13;
      As required by the Engineersâ&#128;&#153; Syndicate, BuildCo must hire an&#13;
      outside engineer to review and approve the plans. Each project&#13;
      has to be licensed by a locally registered and licensed&#13;
      engineering/architecture office even if the project has in-house&#13;
      engineers and architects. Drawings are checked in Ramallah, but&#13;
      a jury from outside the city will check the plans. The cost is a&#13;
5     fixed fee of 4.5 Jordanian dinars per square meter (approximately     21 days       ILS 29,914&#13;
      ILS 23 / sq. m).&#13;
&#13;
      Similarly, a licensed engineering office must be contracted to&#13;
      supervise the construction, as an in-house engineer may not do&#13;
      so.&#13;

GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
Access to reliable and affordable electricity is vital for     WHAT THE GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
businesses. To counter weak electricity supply, many&#13;
firms in developing economies have to rely on self-            INDICATORS MEASURE&#13;
supply, often at a prohibitively high cost. Whether&#13;
electricity is reliably available or not, the first step for   Procedures to obtain an electricity connection&#13;
a customer is always to gain access by obtaining a             (number)&#13;
connection.&#13;

      JDECO will conduct an external inspection to prepare an estimate for the&#13;

      The utility will apply for an excavation permit at the municipality on&#13;
      behalf of the customer. The electricity company also needs to obtain&#13;
      clearances from other utilities and agencies such as water, drainage,&#13;
      telephone, and roads departments.&#13;
&#13;
      For the case study warehouse, a substation is most likely needed. The&#13;
      utility might need to wait some time to obtain the clearances and&#13;
      acquire any material it might not have in stock for an expansion of the       41 calendar days      ILS 71,000&#13;

      utility) needs to submit to the electricity company their electrical plans&#13;
      attesting to the required specifications, and request an inspection of the&#13;
      wiring. In order to obtain a license from the utility the electrician needs&#13;
      to have earned a diploma and had a certain number of years of work&#13;
      experience.&#13;

The reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs      Doing Business uses the system average interruption&#13;
index encompasses quantitative data on the duration        duration index (SAIDI) and the system average&#13;
and frequency of power outages as well as                  interruption frequency index (SAIFI) to measure the&#13;

and restoring power supply, the reporting                  are also collected for the second largest business city).&#13;
relationship between the utility and the regulator for     SAIDI is the average total duration of outages over the&#13;
power outages, the transparency and accessibility of       course of a year for each customer served, while SAIFI is&#13;
tariffs and whether the utility faces a financial          the average number of service interruptions experienced&#13;

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the&#13;
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12&#13;
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does&#13;
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of&#13;
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about&#13;
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for&#13;
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff&#13;
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.&#13;

       The buyer obtains a purchase permit from the Council of Ministers&#13;
       through the Land Authority&#13;
&#13;
       When the buyer of a property is a company it needs to obtain a&#13;
       purchase permit from the Council of Ministers in order to conduct the&#13;
       transfer. Companies submit a request for a purchase permit with the&#13;
       Land Authority. They have to provide copy of the title deed, information&#13;
       about the land and the seller, and also a copy of the certificate of&#13;
       incorporation. Afterwards, the Land Authority will be in touch with the         30 days               no cost&#13;
   1&#13;
       Council of Ministers and the preventive security and intelligence&#13;
       institutions. If their opinion is positive then the Land Authority submits&#13;
       the request to the Council of Ministers for its approval at its next session.&#13;
       After the approval is received the transaction file can be opened at the&#13;
       Land Authority.&#13;

      Open the transaction file at the Land Authority and obtain the&#13;
      property valuation&#13;
&#13;
      The land registry examines the documents and the property file and&#13;
      valuates the property to determine the taxes to be paid.&#13;
      Documents required:&#13;
      - incorporation documents&#13;
      - board resolutions to buy/sell&#13;
      - identification of all parties&#13;
      - notarized POAs&#13;
      - tax clearance from municipality (obtained in procedure 2)                   10 days          $6 - $8&#13;
4&#13;
      The valuation is only needed if the property has not been assessed in the&#13;
      past 5 yearsâ&#128;&#147;which indeed applies to this case. If it has, the value should&#13;
      be in the title file or the parties give an estimate. If not, then an&#13;
      inspection/valuation is required which takes 3 days total and no cost.&#13;
      The registry will then take the remaining time to make its estimate of the&#13;
      value based on the higher of either the parties estimate or the official&#13;
      valuation.&#13;

years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost&#13;
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary&#13;
requirements than does the number of documents required.&#13;

proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is&#13;
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.&#13;

the nonlinear transformation, an increase in the total tax&#13;
rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier&#13;

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it&#13;
would have had before this approach was adopted in&#13;
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in&#13;
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for&#13;
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is&#13;
very high relative to the average), an increase has a&#13;
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores&#13;
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line&#13;
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).&#13;

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and&#13;
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to&#13;
that from the simple average method because both these methods&#13;
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise&#13;
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the&#13;
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,&#13;
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the&#13;
context of a specific economy.&#13;

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according&#13;
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned&#13;
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit&#13;
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal&#13;
weights&#13;

            Doing business 2016 : measuring regulatory
            quality and efficiency - West Bank and Gaza
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This economy profile for Doing Business
            2016 presents the 11 Doing Business indicators for West Bank
            and Gaza. To allow for useful comparison, the profile also
            provides data for other selected economies (comparator
            economies) for each indicator. Doing Business 2016 is the
            13th edition in a series of annual reports measuring the
            regulations that enhance business activity and those that
            constrain it. Economies are ranked on their ease of doing
            business; for 2015 West Bank and Gaza ranks 129. A high ease
            of doing business ranking means the regulatory environment
            is more conducive to the starting and operation of a local
            firm. Doing Business presents quantitative indicators on
            business regulations and the protection of property rights
            that can be compared across 189 economies from Afghanistan
            to Zimbabwe and over time. Doing Business sheds light on how
            easy or difficult it is for a local entrepreneur to open and
            run a small to medium-size business when complying with
            relevant regulations. It measures and tracks changes in
            regulations affecting 11 areas in the life cycle of a
            business: starting a business, dealing with construction
            permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
            credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
            across borders, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency
            and labor market regulation. The data in this report are
            current as of June 1, 2015 (except for the paying taxes
            indicators, which cover the period from January to December 2014).
