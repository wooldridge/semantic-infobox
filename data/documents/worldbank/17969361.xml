&#13;
OLIVER:     May we talk a bit about how and why you came to the World Bank           President's office which wsa the same room I had had when I was a&#13;
&#13;
from the Monetary Fund as well aa your impreesion of the Bank at that                Division Chief of the International Monetary Fund many years before.&#13;
&#13;
time?                                                                                It was a cubby-hole compared to the luxurious rooms that Geoffrey&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:    When I came to the World Bank, the two leading figures were             Wilson and Burke Knapp had next to the President.         Woods was furious&#13;
&#13;
Geoffrey Wilson, who had not yet become     ~     Geoffrey Wilson, and Burke         and a new room near him was created, but it alerted me to the fact that&#13;
&#13;
Knapp.    It was my understanding that, between the two, Burke was the               I was going to have some difficulty being accepted in this environment.&#13;
more senior.     Although no one had the authority and position that                 OLIVER:     Do you want to repeat the admonition from Pierre Paul&#13;
Robert Garner had had, in the abeence of the President, Burke was                    Schweitzer in the Fund to make sure that you were at a higher rank than&#13;
&#13;
clearly the person left in charge.                                                   you bad been in' the Fund?&#13;
&#13;
          Geoffrey Wilson, who had the reputation for being a very fine              FRIEDMAN:     Scbweiuer eaid, ''Why do you want to do it?"           I explained&#13;
&#13;
person, moral, ca.mitted and so forth, I found disappointing.          I fully       that I had been in my present position in the Fund for many yeara, and&#13;
&#13;
expected that I would find him a person that I would like very much.             I   this vas a chance to do something worthwhile and different.               ''Well," he&#13;
&#13;
had had very close relations with the Britiah.        The fact that he was           said, "You will    aho~ays    be, until the end of your career, Number Three&#13;
&#13;
English and part of the British government was, from       ~y   point of view,       in the Fund,     No one can ever displace you.     As for being      Nu~ber   Two&#13;
&#13;
all in his favor.     But I found very quickly that he would do                      (i.e., Deputy Managing Director) that is up to the U. S. Government,&#13;
&#13;
objectionable things like, at the President's Council, correct Woods in              your own government.         They're the ones who select the   Nu~ber     Two."       I&#13;
&#13;
the middle of a sentence, tell him that his pronunciation wasn't right.              had known that Per Jacobbson had recommended me to be the            Nu~ber   Two&#13;
&#13;
It was terribly embarrassing.     He didn't seem to think anything of it.            person when Merle Cochran left (if the U. S. elected to &amp;elect someone&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                           3                                                                                  4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
from the staff), but Frank Southar4 was selected.       He ha4 served many               When I took this up with Woods, his reaction was that it was a&#13;
&#13;
year~   with distinction on the Board as the U. S. Director.                    perfectly reasonable attitude on Schweitzer's part.          He said,     Â·~ell,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           One of the things I told Schweitzer at the time:     "I worked for   we'll lllake you a vice-president,"     Then he came back in just a few days&#13;
                                                                                                                                                    I&#13;
the Treasury where we regarded the Fund and the Bank as Bretton Woods           (this ia all within the compass of a week or so) and said, "I've&#13;
&#13;
Twins."     Schweitzer said, "Twinal,    These institutions don't get along     checked it out and it's going to be difficult.          I've got   t~o   problems.&#13;
&#13;
at all; they have very little to do with one another."        I said, ''Well,   One is I would have a second vice-president who is an American.              (They&#13;
&#13;
at least that's what we were called; if we're not twins I will do my            already had Burke Knapp.)      The other is that Alderwereld is raising the&#13;
&#13;
beat to make us cousins,"     (That was a sort of .22n .!!121 that I had        question as to why he doesn't become a vice-president too, ao I'll have&#13;
&#13;
reason to remember in the future.       I sometimes used it in speeches that    to make him a vice-president.       Then I'll have three vice-presidents.&#13;
&#13;
I gave about cooperation between the two institutions.)        Schweitzer       You'd be the fourth.      That'a difficult.      Can you think of something&#13;
&#13;
repeated, "I want to 1118ke it clear that, if you go, you have to get a         else?"&#13;
&#13;
promotion."                                                                               I thought, well, the job that I was getting, as          discussed with&#13;
&#13;
           At this point in time I had been at the top of the salary range      Woods, waa going to be of an economic nature and, therefore, could have&#13;
&#13;
of the Monetary Fund for about five, six, seven, eight years; I can't           Economics or Economist in the title.       It would indicate what I was&#13;
&#13;
reme~ber    exactly, because the rule vas that no department director           really going to do.      So I came up with the idea of     being~        Economic&#13;
&#13;
could get paid more than an Executive Director.       There were certain        Advisor to the President.       The emphasis of being 1Jlt with a capital "1''&#13;
&#13;
countries like the United States and Canada which consistently and              was because the World Bank already had economic advisors within the&#13;
&#13;
successfully opposed an increase in the salaries of Executive                   departmenta--~ithin      the Projects Department and the Loan Departments&#13;
&#13;
Directors.     Therefore I, as a department head, waa one of the very few       like Andy   Ka~arck,   who was Economic Advisor in the Africa Department.&#13;
&#13;
people who for years had not been able to get any promotion whatever.           To distinguish   ~     from them, I put in the   word~     EconOIDic Advisor.&#13;
&#13;
I was at the top for a staff member.       So what Schweitzer was saying was    Woods added that he could form a President's Council, and all of ita&#13;
&#13;
very specific.     In the World Bank, the precedent had been set that           members would have vice-presidential rank irrespective of title.&#13;
&#13;
Burke Knapp and Geoffrey Wilson, like Garner before, had been paid more         came out with a title, and J came out with a promotion of $1,000 a&#13;
&#13;
than an Executive Director.     Schweitzer ss)'ing, "You have to get a          year, $1,000 more than the Executive Directors were making.              I broke&#13;
&#13;
promotion," had real 111eaning and could be done.                               the barrier.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                            5                                                                                      6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         One of the things that Woods a aid at that     t   i111e was very clear: "I   been a distinguished, well thought of, and honored person, regarded as&#13;
&#13;
can tell you nov that if you COllie to the World Bank, 1 prollli&amp;e you, you            kind of a brain-trust, at least within the Bank and the IFC and ao111e of&#13;
&#13;
will never suffer in any way, shape, or for111 fr0111 111oving fro111 the Fund         the technical assistance progrBIPS of the UNDP), raised the question&#13;
                                                                                                                                                        I&#13;
to the Bank."    I had 111ade the point that Jacobbson had put in three                with Woods, ''What about 111e ?"    So within a abort period of ti111e, we had&#13;
&#13;
n81Pes to become Deputy Managing Director:      Jacque&amp; Polak, Peter Gold              aiz cars instead of two, and we had six people on the Prestdent'a&#13;
&#13;
and myself.     "I have some chance to become an Deputy Managing                       Council.     Then Geoffrey Wilson dropped out and    was~     replaced.     We&#13;
&#13;
Director," I told him, "in which ca11e I would break the sound barrier,                had the 1181Pe President's Council for four yeara of Wood's&#13;
&#13;
the salary barrier."     He said, ''Well if you co111e to the Bank, you will           ad111inistration.   It consisted of Woods as Chairman, Knapp, De111uth,&#13;
&#13;
never suffer in relation to Polak or Gold.       You will always be paid as            Broches, Alderwereld and myself,&#13;
&#13;
much as they and as much as one of the vice presidents here.            You're                  We met every day at 9:30 -- out of courtesy to 111e.        Everyone&#13;
&#13;
never going to be in any danger of suffering financially fr0111 coming to              else waâ&#128;¢ prepared to come at 9:00, but I explained to Woods that 1 had&#13;
&#13;
the Bank."    That was an agreement later reneged on by the Bank.                      to be driven in froa Bethesda, so ve met at 9:30.         Woods vas very&#13;
&#13;
         As for my request for a car, Woods said,       "We can't have three           understanding, though he could also become very illlpatient at         t~es.&#13;
&#13;
cara yet; l might get another in the future, but why don't you and                     One of his problems was courtesy.         I got the feeling that there were&#13;
&#13;
Geoffrey share a carT"     Geoffrey Wilson said he wouldn't share hia car.             two people he didn't like.         One vas Dick Demuth and the other vas Burke&#13;
Woods was very upset because he couldn't see why Wilson couldn't share                 Knapp.     Woods would aay of Demuth, ''Why don't we get rid of that guy.&#13;
a car, but he would not share a car.      So we got an eztra car assigned              He'e sick."     Dick did have a bad back, but there was nothing really&#13;
&#13;
to me.   Alderwereld also got a car.     That established the principle of             wrong with him.     Woods juat didn't like him.     Why, I don't know.      I&#13;
&#13;
a separate car for every member of the President's Council.                            have no idea why not.       All 1 know is that 1 repeatedly told Woods I&#13;
&#13;
         Within about a month or so, Ronnie Brochea,          the General              didn't agree with hi111 about Demuth.&#13;
&#13;
Counsel of the Bank, raised the queation,       "If Alderwereld can be vice-                      I think Burke was too smiley for Woods.      Burke always &amp;111iled at&#13;
&#13;
president, what about mel     I was at Bretton Woods as part of the Dutch              everything; whatever happened he'd greet it with a smile.            I believe&#13;
&#13;
delegation just like Sim Alderwereld, and, as our General Counsel, I                   tha~   Woods never felt that he had Burke's real respect.       Burke came out&#13;
&#13;
think I ought to be a vice-president too."       At shout the sa111e ti111e,           of the Eugene Black era.       He vas quite well regarded in the Bank, and&#13;
&#13;
Dick Demuth, who was Director of Technical Assistance (and had also                    as far as I know,    Woo~   never did anything to diminish his authority.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                         7                                                                                      8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Quite to the contrary.      Woods would make it very clear to department        to the best of my recollection, he never     beca~e   a   fo~al   member.      That&#13;
&#13;
dire~tors    and to those of us on the President'â&#128;¢ Council that the second      did not mean he didn't have enough rank.      As a matter of fact, in his&#13;
&#13;
man in the Bank was Burke Knapp.      I   rem~ber   once in the senior staff    own way, Marty had more rank than anybody on the President's Council.&#13;
                                                                                                                                                   t&#13;
meeting, where we had present many        departGent directors apd members of   But it was very definitely the intention of Woods, and it was clear to&#13;
&#13;
the President's Council,      Woods stated his view of the Bank hierarchy:      everyone else, to have a kind of Chinese Wall between the          ire    and the&#13;
&#13;
the department directors were one-star generals, members of the                 World Bank.     The IFC was part of the World Bank Group, aa it later&#13;
&#13;
President's Council were two-star generals, Burke bad three stars and           became known, but it really operated very largely as an autonomous&#13;
&#13;
he had four stars.      That's how he saw the Bank.                             institution.     So Marty Rosen would have his own meetings with Woods,&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     When did it become known as the President's Council?                Marty was very clear that he did not report to Burke Knapp or to anyone&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     It was only a matter of weeks, if not instantaneously, after      on the President's Council, that his relations were with the President&#13;
&#13;
I joined the Bank in September, 1964, It was one of the devices Woods           of the Bank, who was the head of IFC aa well.         It was generally believed&#13;
&#13;
created to accommodate my coming into the Bank from the outside. Aa he          that Marty Rosen believed that he had been promised by        Blac~      that he&#13;
&#13;
told me over and over again, one of the reasons for the President's             would become the Preaident of IFC.      (I knew Harty from previous years&#13;
&#13;
Council was to make clear that anyone on the Council was co-equal in            --not very well, but well enough.)       He didn't make any secret of his&#13;
&#13;
rank with anyone else.      He didn't have to give Ronnie Brdches the           belief that he thought that Woods was co.mitted to making him&#13;
formal title, Vice-President, which he didn't,         He didn't have to give   President.     Woods did not make him President of the lfC, however.&#13;
a new title to Dick Demuth.      He didn't have to give a new title to          OLIVER:     Do you remember off-hand whether any minutes were          ta~en   in the&#13;
Irving friedman, because, as he would always describe it, these people          President's Council?&#13;
&#13;
are members of the President's Council, all of whom have the rank of            FRIEDMAN:     No. I don't think so.   ! don't remember any minutes being&#13;
&#13;
vice-president.      It was a convenient device which he installed.             taken.    We had no secretary.&#13;
&#13;
Whether someone suggested it to him, I just don't know.                         OLIVER:     Was the President's Council the same thing as the Senior&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER;     These were the members:   Aldervereld, Brochea, Demuth,             staff?    There was a Senior Staff Committee?&#13;

Friedman, and Knapp?                                                            FRIEDMAN:     Yea.   There was a body that consisted of all the Department&#13;
&#13;
fRIEDMAN:     Yes.   from time to time, they would invite Harty Rosen, as       Directors and the Vice-Presidents meeting with the President.&#13;
&#13;
Executive Vice President of the IFC, to the President's Council, but,           OLIVER:     That was bigger?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     Much, and   s~ewhat   more formal.   I think it had a                   World Bank?                At the moat, I had met him once before at an Annual&#13;
&#13;
Secr~tariat    probably headed by the Secretary of the Bank, Horton                   Meeting.           I would have said at the time I didnâ&#128;¢t know him, but I                             ca~e&#13;
&#13;
Hendels.     l think there was a more formal record of decisions made.           As   to feel that I bad been introduced to hUn at the previous Governor's&#13;
for the President's Council, I don't       r~~ber    whether or not anyone            Conference.&#13;
&#13;
wade a note of any particular decision that had been wade.            It was,                          At that time, he said, he was considering asking                           Â·~   tu come&#13;
basically, a decision-making body, although obviously it was                          over to for. an economics staff and direct the                            econo~ics         work.    Would&#13;
fundamentally an advisory body to the Pre1ident, because no decision                  1 do for the Bank what he knew, what everybody knew, I had done for the&#13;
&#13;
would have been made against his opposition to it.         I'm trying hard to         International Monetary Fund.                   Could I        organi~e    the work with countries&#13;
think whether I can recollect any minutes, but I don't.         That doesn't          and bring about something that was equivalent for the Bank.                                      He felt,&#13;
mean it didn't happen.      I just don't remember.                                    and I'll never forget that conversation because it was ao important in&#13;
OLIVER:     The President's Council met daily or weekly?                              my whole career, that as a Bank it did not need an economics staff, but&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     Daily.   And Woods preferred that, when he was away, it met             J!2l!l   .1hll   .t.hÂ§.   ..!!A.DI!. included IDA M   ..lmt   .1M Jltt!! .fru:   ..lll   economics .llillÂ·&#13;

one for believing in coordination and keeping ua all informed.            I later     decisiona.                He didn't think the Bank needed an              econ~ics          staff; bankers&#13;
found out that it wasn't true.        A number of these fellows simply                knew bow to make loans; but when it came to IDA, it was not lending; you&#13;
ignored Woods and wouldn't inform the President's Council of what they                were giving someone a gift.                   Since the Bank would be entrusted with&#13;

OLIVER:     Hay we go back a bit and have you say how Hr. Woods came to               amount of grant money as well aa function, he felt the need for an&#13;
know about you and how he selected you to be the peraon to direct the                 economics staff.                He had heard that I bad done this for the Monetary&#13;
econ~ica    work of the Bankt       Did you know each other before then?        Or    Fund.       Would I come and do it for the Bank?&#13;
were you introduced by some intermediary?                                                          He didn't indicate at all who bad suggested me.                               At that time,&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     I can only tell you what I know, and I think it's very                  I thought that I had been suggested by Andy Overby, who waa the person&#13;
&#13;
incomplete.     I'd love, myself, to know the full story of this, because             in First Boston who was most familiar with what I had done in the&#13;
&#13;
l never did.     I was called in the afternoon, I think it was June or so             Monetary Fund.                I never asked George, but sometime later, maybe years&#13;
&#13;
of 1964:    Would I come over and have lunch with the President of the                later, I asked Andy Overby whether he bad reco. .ended me, and he said,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                           11                                                                                12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
"I recOIDIIlended you, but George called me up one day and said, 'I'm           FRIEDMAN:      Exactly, he'd just become.    But I've no idea to this day who&#13;
&#13;
goinâ&#128;¢ to ask Irving Friedman to come over and talk about tbia. What do          originated the offer Â·to me.&#13;
&#13;
you think of the mao?'"     He aaid, "Of course, I   rec~ended       you, but         Woods told me the name of the other person he was considering:&#13;
                                                                                                                                                   f&#13;

&#13;
           At this point in my career, I had very close relations with the      economic advisor to the British Treasury.         I knew him and   t~ought   very&#13;
&#13;
U S Government, the Japanese Government, the Briti&amp;h Government, the            highly of him.       Woods told me that this man had been suggested to him&#13;
&#13;
German Government and othera.      I was, in many respects, I think             and asked me what I thought of him.         I told him that this person was&#13;
&#13;
everyone would agree at tbe time, the most eminent person in the                truly outstanding,        If he got this person, I didn't think be could go&#13;

outside of the Managing Director    h~aelf.     I had more to do with           I believe, was that he was finding out whether Cairocrosa vas a serious&#13;

governments even than the Deputy Managing Director.       In addition, after    candidate.      I had known Alec Cairncross for a long time and I had a&#13;
&#13;
Woods' offer, the United States Executive Director of the Fund, who vas         very high regard for him.        In fact I told Woods about his career in&#13;
&#13;
Bill Dale and the Executive Director of the Bank (I'm trying to think,          much more detail than he knew.       Then, aome days later, because we began&#13;
&#13;
a Philadelphia lawyer who was -- I think he was a Philadelphia lawyer           to have a aeries of luncheons at this point in time, Woods told me that&#13;
&#13;
-- who vas the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury and also the                 this fellow, Cairncroas, whom I don't think Woods had ever .et, maybe&#13;
&#13;
Executive Director of the Bank) invited me to lunch.       They told me that    later, was just not available. From then on we began to talk precisely&#13;
&#13;
they understood that I was being asked to take this position in the             about what terms and conditions would govern my coming to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Bank.     From the point of view of the U. S, Government, they said, this                I really don't know, Bob, what would have happened if&#13;

vas terribly important; it would be very much appreciated if I would be         Cairncroaa had been able to say, "Yes."        I might never have gone to the&#13;
&#13;
willing to leave my post in the Fund and take this post in the Bank.            World Bank.Â·    Woods never had to choose between Cahocross and Friedman.&#13;
&#13;
They didn't give me any reason to believe that it was the       u.   S.         He had friedman willing to come and Alec Cairncroas uncertain that he&#13;
&#13;
Government that suggested it, but it could have been.       I was quite well    would come.      I   believe that the British Government would not let him&#13;
&#13;
known to "Joe" Fowler who vas the Secretary of the Treasury at that             go.   Of course, in a way, this aspect made the job more attractive to&#13;
&#13;
time.                                                                           me.   I vas a very strong admirer of Alec Cairncross from every point of&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                              13                                                                               14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
.el   It put a stamp on the job of the kind of person that would be                    Monetary Fund.   When I went to see Eric loll in England, he was very&#13;
&#13;
cona~dered    for it.     1 felt quite comfortable with the whole idea.                enthusiastic about my going to the Bank; but John Stevena of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
That waa the circumstance under which 1 came to the World Bank.                        of England thought it was "dropping out of the top drawer."        He bad&#13;
&#13;
           I have one other memory, which 1 hope    doean~t   find its way into        been the European Department Director of the Fund for two ~ears.&#13;
the book yet, but it's part of my understanding of the World Bank aa I                         When I first saw Peter Lieftingk, for whom I had    h~gh    regard,&#13;
came to aee it in retrospect.        I have had a kind of a aenae of                   Peter said, "you've got to go to the Bank becsuse that's where you can&#13;
&#13;
grievance toward some of my friends who were in the World Bank, that                   make a great contribution.     You;re more needed in the Bank than you are&#13;
&#13;
they never tipped me off to the kind of bureaucratic problema I vas                    in the Monetary Fund."     When I went to see Bill Hartin, with whom 1 was&#13;
&#13;
going to have there.        Close friends like David Gordon, whom I bad known          quite friendly and saw faidy often in those days, Bill said, "Anyone&#13;
&#13;
from before the War, and people like Morton Hendela vbo were          ~eterana     â&#128;¢   who bas a chance to work for George Woods can't turn it down."        1 went&#13;
&#13;
of the Bank.     When I vent and asked about the World Bank, I got very                to see Charlie Coombs, who at this point was the Senior    Vi~e    President,&#13;
&#13;
evasive replies.        I didn't nov bow to interpret them.   Later on, when I         International, for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which in those&#13;
&#13;
bad had my own experience, I knew bow to interpret them.           The only            daya was a key position.     (There were very few people in the monetary&#13;
&#13;
person who, I remember, was really candid with me was Zaki Saad.                       field who bad concentrated on the international aide, and Charlie was&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Zaki â&#128;¢â&#128;¢                                                                    easily one of two or three moat unique persona in the field).        Charlie&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:              Saad, Executive Director for Egypt since 1946.     He was the   said, "There's no comparison between the Fund and the Bank.       We in New&#13;
&#13;
moat powerful Egyptian Executive Director the Bank ever had.          He really        York have a high opinion of the World Bank; we think very little of the&#13;
&#13;
understood it.        He and I were very close personal friends.    When be            Monetary Fund.   So if you get a chance to do tbia in the World Bank,&#13;
heard that I was going to the Bank, he waa quite unhappy.          He said,            you can't turn it down."&#13;
&#13;
Â·~ell,    you know, you've decided to go, so you go; but 1 warn you the                        A bit more about John Stevens.     John Stevena was an Advisor to&#13;
person with the longest blade in that Bank, and who wields it moat                     the Governor of the Bank of England.     He bad been both an executive&#13;
skillfully, is this fellow Burke Knapp.        Never trust him."    Frankly I          director and department director in the IMF.    We bad been close&#13;
&#13;
didn't believe him, because I bad always felt Burke vas a very nice                    colleagues, and since I beaded the U. K. annual consultations, I saw&#13;
&#13;
person.     I had to learn from experience that this bureaucracy that I                him repeatedly. We were close personal friends.     I remember taking a&#13;
&#13;
was dealing with in the World Bank was gothin&amp; like we bad in the                      walk with him at Winds9r Castle before I finally accepted this offer.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                                                             16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I asked him what he thought.   I'd spoken to Eric Roll and others and             This waa not a new iaaue, I had always been one of those who felt that&#13;
&#13;
all \'ere well dieposed, and I was predillpoeed to eay, "Yea".     He said,       in aome way there ought to be more cooperation and collaboration&#13;
&#13;
"Well, I see you've decided to do it, but I can tell you when you leave           between the two.     I remember making thia suggestion, and Jacques Polak&#13;
                                                                                                                                                  f&#13;

&#13;
        I guess 1 didn't want to believe that.     1 never quite                  publication?"     That ended the discussion.    There wasn't anyone in that&#13;
understood the wisdom of that observation until 1 went to the World               room who was prepared to identify an economist in the World Bank who&#13;
Bank and had my own experience.   In the eyes of the world, I waa going           would be good enough to contribute to journale which were also being&#13;
up; in the eyes of the world, this was a glorious job.     But not from           contributed to by the IHF staff.&#13;
&#13;
the inside of both institution&amp;, not from those who knew more about tKe                      This was a view of the World Bank that you got from inside the&#13;
environment of the World Bank than I did.                                         Fund.   It wasn't a view that I shared.       I had always bad respect for&#13;
&#13;
        May I interrupt this train of thought with a recollection of              Paul â&#128;¢oaenstein-Rodan and Jerry Alter, whom I had tried to recruit to&#13;
&#13;
possible interest. In about 1960, I think it waa (Per Jacobbaon was               come to the IMF.     I knew Bob De Vries.     I knew Andrew lamarck.     l knew&#13;
&#13;
still alive), we had a meeting of Fund department beade,     The idea came        Sandy Stevenson.     I knew quite a bit about fellows there    fr~     other&#13;
&#13;
up that we ought to have a publication called Fipance to give a sort of           places, including the U, S, Treasury, l saw the. as pretty intelligent&#13;
&#13;
running commentary, leas technical   than~~             of what was going         fellows.    There was a group of people, however, both in the Fund and&#13;
&#13;
on in the field.   Per Jacobbson bad already made that known.      It was         outside, particularly in the central banking community, that regarded&#13;
&#13;
felt we ought to get beyond our ]lJtf   ~.       which was kind of                the World Bank people as bankers.       They wore homburgs and made loans&#13;
&#13;
academic. We could use and afford another publication.     Jay Reed was in        and that's all.     Of course we were jealous about all the favorable&#13;
&#13;
charge of publications and was all for it       maybe he requeeted it.        I   publicity they'd been getting in the preaa where we in the Fund got&#13;
&#13;
was a strong supporter of tbie proposal, and made the auggeation:        it       very little favorable publicity in those days.        There was this kind of&#13;
might be a good idea if we aaked the Bank to join.     We would make a            mixed attitude.&#13;
&#13;
joint publication of the Fund and the Bank.     The issue of whether we                      When Woods approached me about a job, 1 came at it backwards,&#13;
ought to do things jointly with the Bank had been there    fr~     the first      We're pretty snobbish about the IHF; and to be, aa I waa, in the kind&#13;
day when we talked about staff, the joint library, the building, etc.             of position I had in    t~   IHF -- it was a hard thing to leave.       To this&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                          17                                                                                      18&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
day, I can aay now, after many years of retrospect, I'm not at all sure          whether he was the one who had made this recommendation, because any&#13;
&#13;
I   m~e   the right career decision, within atraigbt career decision             recommendstion made by George Willie would have been taken very&#13;
&#13;
terms.     It'a kind of fascinating to think back on those daya and see          aerioualy.&#13;
&#13;
the evolution of my career in the Bank, because it was ao reflective of          OLIVER:     When you came to the Bank what did you perceive aa your&#13;
&#13;
some basic problema.         With the World Bank people, from the first day, I   primary responsibility?     I   reali~e   it was to do economic analysis.&#13;
&#13;
found    m~aelf   having iaeuea with respect to substance at the World Bank.     By two years sfter you went there, the World Bank was beginning to&#13;
&#13;
That remained true until I left.          That doesn't answer your question of   turn out World Bank Tables and that sort of thing.           So, I ask two&#13;
&#13;
who suggested my appointment.          But I really don't know.                  questions:     What did you perceive as your major course of action?&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Ia Andy Oyerby still alive?                                          and How did you go about it7&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     No Andy died last year.                                            FRI2DHAN:     Well, I think it's fair to say that my major course of&#13;
OLIVER:     He might have known.       Even if he didn't â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢                     action waa well diacuaaed at every stage with Wooda.            He gave me a&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     Well, if he did, he never told me; and be and I were very          lot of initiative, a lot of endorsement.         I had a mandate to suggeat&#13;
&#13;
cloue.     I think I could aay that Bill Martin and I were his two beat          snything I wanted and rarely got turned down.         It waa    8   part of his&#13;
&#13;
friends,     He aaid   80   to everybody, and to me, that we were bia two beat   activities as well sa mine,      But as I saw the job, the first thing&#13;
&#13;
friends.     Within all the years that followed, he never told me that be        waa to build au economics ataff at the World Bsnk that bad at lesat&#13;
&#13;
knew who proposed me to Woods.          I think be knew that I was always very   the same standing in the world community, whether it was acsdemic,&#13;
&#13;
curious,     I still am very curious as to who first suggested my name.          governmental or central bank, aa the Monetary Fund -- at leaat up to&#13;
&#13;
Of courae it could have been the D. S. Treasury, because at that time            the reputation the World Bank now has.&#13;
&#13;
George Willis was the Director of International Finance at the                             In those days it did not have that reputstion.            It had the&#13;
&#13;
Treasury, which was the key civil service position, and he had a high            reputation of a iuatitution that once had had a very fine economics&#13;
&#13;
regard for me, aa I for him.          People saked George Willis about people.   staff, but it bad been largely disbanded.         Individuals within the&#13;
&#13;
George Willia was the man who had recommended me to Andy Overby in 1948          World Bank like Drag Abrsmovic, Andy Kamarck and Jerry Alter were&#13;
&#13;
without my ever having met Overby.          That ia bow I made my first msjor    highly regarded in the economics profession and highly regarded in&#13;
change within the Fund.          I never asked George shout thia.   I guesa I    the International Monetary Fund by those of us who knew them, but&#13;
could ssk him now.          That's interesting.   Maybe I ought to ask George    they were not part of an    organi~ed     economics ataff.     At this point&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   19                                                                            20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Leonard Rist, who had been years earlier the formal head of the               itself.    That's how 1 picked Andy Xamarck.     I thought very highly of&#13;
&#13;
efonomica staff, had the title of Special Advisor, but he was not             Andy Kamarck (I'd known him from the U. S, Treasury days), but I&#13;
&#13;
playing any important role.     I think be was brought in on the              also knew that be wae a very highly regarded economic advisor, in&#13;
                                                                                                                                          I&#13;
Cehe~iro    Project in the Sudan, but it wasn't of all that general           many respect&amp; the moat highly regarded economic advieor in the Bank.               1&#13;
&#13;
interest.     We knew that Drag Abramovic bad been working on commodity       went around and asked World Bank people to give me on a     ~ieee       of paper&#13;
&#13;
problema and bad been doing some work on debt.       Tbe Bank bad an          five names that they felt were the beat economists in the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Economic Developaent Institute of which Hike Hoffman was head. John           Andy was on everybody's list.    He wae the moat highly rated person in&#13;
&#13;
Adler was teaching there at the time.       Tbia was kind of a mixed          this poll that I took, and that fitted in with my own biaaes in hia&#13;
&#13;
situation, but the Bank didn't have an economics staff aa such.               favor.    So he became my principal lieutenant.&#13;
&#13;
           I thought my firat job, clearly indicated by Hr. Woods, was                  After we started the process of recruitment, we       organi~ed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
to go out and recruit and organize an economics staff aa a                    divisions that we would put in our economic structure.          Those&#13;
&#13;
department.     We had to go out and hire people, and I told Woods we         divisions were be the ones you'd expect.       We agreed to have one on&#13;
&#13;
had to pay people more than the Monetary Fund.       I wanted his             Debt, one on Commoditiea, and one on other functional divisions,&#13;
&#13;
agreement that I could pay 10 percent more for the same kind of               including Statistics.    We had people at the Bank who had already&#13;
&#13;
person than the Monetary Fund.       I needed to out compete the Fund.        done external debt statistics, for example.       One of the first things&#13;
&#13;
In order to get people of the Fund's caliber to      co~e   to ua, we had     we did was to start a structural program of external debt statistics&#13;
to be seen ae attractive in many different waya         acad~ically,     by   collection.    That's when the Statistical Tables began to emerge.          We&#13;
&#13;
reputation and aalary.     He heartily agreed.    I had no problem in         first began the process of putting together what we vanted, creating&#13;
that regard.    We did the usual thing.    We went out and contacted the      the forma, and so forth. In addition to the structure of the staff, I,&#13;
universities.     We very quickly started to compete.       I think, Bob, I   from my experience in the Monetary Fund, desired to put us immediately&#13;
hired hundreds of people.     Andy Kamarck, whom I made Director of the       to work on certain problems.    Some of the problems vere there waiting&#13;
nev Economics Department reporting to me, played a major role in              for us.    One of the first things we worked on, for example, was how big&#13;
recruitment and    reorgani~ation.                                            should the First IDA Replenishment be?     How do you make a judgment on&#13;
&#13;
       I had to decide who would be head of the Economic&amp;                     how big IDA should be?    That's a separate little story, but Woods at&#13;
&#13;
Department.     I decided then that he would come from within the Bank        this point in time had undertaken the responsibility for the First IDA&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  21                                                                                22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Replenishment rather than the Secretary of the Treasury.         That put the    that became my group for the Supplementary Finance Proposal.            These&#13;
&#13;
onus on the Bank to have a position on how big the IDA should be.          The   included Thalwitz, for example, who i&amp; oow vice-president for West&#13;
    i&#13;
original IDA had been decided in the U.      s.   Treasury in consultation       Africa.     The Indian, Ravi Gulhati, who is still in the World Bank,&#13;
&#13;
with other governments but now thia became a Bank function, and one of           was on my crew.     I needed about three or four, and I reciuited them in&#13;
&#13;
~       first functions was to decide how big IDA should be.                     the first instance from the World Bank itself.       I had   le~   the word get&#13;
&#13;
              In that connection, one of the first tasks waa our own             out that anybody who vas an economist in the World Bank and would like&#13;
&#13;
assessment of the capital requirements of developing countries.          There   to work with us, if it was agreeable to the peraon with whom they were&#13;
&#13;
had been a big dispute going on at that time yitb people like Raoul              working, could apply to transfer into thia group.       So we got quite a&#13;
&#13;
Prebiscb as to what wa1 the absorptive capacity of the developing                sizeable group.     I found actually that there were many,       well-trained&#13;
&#13;
countries that were members of the World Bank and IDA.         l had   thoug~t   economists in the World Bank, but they weren't doing economics.             There&#13;
&#13;
that, as a prerequiaite for a good judgment on the IDA Replenishment,,           vas a pool of talent within the World Bank that I could        ~raw     upon and&#13;
&#13;
the Bank ought to have its own judgment as to what was the abaorptive            Ajg draw upon.&#13;
&#13;
capacity of developing countries.       I'll he glad to tell you more about                A few people were hired to improve the international character&#13;
&#13;
what these atudies consisted of.                                                 of the staff and bring the latest in training aod thinking from outside&#13;
&#13;
             Another task that came up immediately was to deal with two          the Bank.     One from Brazil, one from India, Bimmal Jalan; one from&#13;
&#13;
UNCTAD resolutions:       Before I had come to the Bank, UNCTAD had              Pakistan, who in the end could not come for family reasons; one, named&#13;
&#13;
started to operate (in 1960), and there had just been the 1964 session           Heenart Sundrum, from Burma.        I forget one or two names,&#13;
&#13;
of the UNCTAD.       At that time, two resolutions bad been passed.     One                I recruited men on a personal baaia {in the aenae that they&#13;
&#13;
dealt with the so-called Horowit1 Proposal, which vas a form of                  were people I koew or came highly reco.-ended by people I knew and&#13;
interest-rate subsidization; the secood waa what came to he called the           were highly thought of) to come      i~diately   so that at the beginning&#13;
Supplementary Finance Proposal.       Both of these resolutions bad been         there would be an international staff in addition to the World Bank&#13;
passed by the UNCTAD.       They both requeated the World Bank to make a         ataff.    They became my peraonal kitchen cabinet.     We had a miniature&#13;
study and to report back to the UNCTAD the findings of such atudies.             senior economics council that discusaed these thinga.         (Bimmal Jalan&#13;
            The first miasion I undertook waa on The Horowitz Propoaal.          is now the Economic Secretary of the Government of lodia, and&#13;
Very quickly, in a matter of just weeks, I also organized a group                aaralear Pereira    Li~ b~came   Governor of the central Bank of Brazil.)&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     23                                                                               24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We had a group of people all of whom proved to be very able.               It was   country?    Is it a sound program, feasible.     Ia it economically&#13;
&#13;
a   v~ry   inspiring little group, in addition to those from the Bank.              sensible?    Ia the country appropriate for IDA support?     Ia it&#13;
    had them working on IDA, capital requirements, the      Horowit~                creditworthy for the Bank?    Do ita development activities merit the&#13;
                                                                                                                                                  I&#13;
Proposal, the Supplementary Finance Proposal and other matters.                     support of the Bank?    We had long discussions of shadow prices and&#13;
&#13;
           From the very beginning, I went to work on the idea of                   issues of that kind in this Economic Committee before we     ~uld      paaa a&#13;
&#13;
organizing consultations with countries:      country programs similar              loan on to the Loan COMmittee.    (Woods waa very good in pOlicing this&#13;
&#13;
to the IMF embodying the notion that for every country the World                    and making sure that this innovation was followed.)      The Economic&#13;
&#13;
Bank would have a view about ita development program -- bow the                     Committee would have to come up with a decision, a recommendation to&#13;
&#13;
investment program and related policies of the country were                         the Loan Committee and the President, that we felt that this country&#13;
perceived by the Bank and how we in the World Bank related to it in                 was suitable and this proposed loan would be proper.&#13;
our lending program.     We immediately started to organize work.            I                  The other innovation was that I invited the chairmen, the&#13;
sought an understanding that, although the economic advisors within                 department directors, of the area   departments~~         Fund to attend all&#13;
the area departments would continue to report to the directors of                   our meetings whenever their country was discussed.       Because of my&#13;
&#13;
the area departments, they would be led by me.      I got    (it~a    in            personal relations with the heads of the area departments in tbe Fund,&#13;
&#13;
writing somewhere) reaponaibility for the professional caliber of                   I got them to do it.    They agreed that they would not ask for formal&#13;
&#13;
their work, their profeaaional output.                                              permission from the Fund management, because we knew they would&#13;
&#13;
            With thia kind of approach we very quickly organized the ao-            probably not get it.    It was a matter of principle.     The Fund-Bank&#13;
called Economic Committee which Woods bad to approve because it was a               relationship had not advanced to the point where the Fund would have&#13;
&#13;
real innovation.      It waa not called for in the Articles of Agreement            been prepared to agree formally      at least that was my judgment,&#13;
&#13;
like the Loan Committee, which at that time was being chaired by Burke              having just come from the Fund,     I was a staunch advocate of close&#13;
&#13;
Knapp.     The Economic Committee was an innovation where the heads of all          Fund-Bank relations, but I was now in the Bank, rather than advocating&#13;
&#13;
departments (and anyone they wanted to bring) could come.            Every loan     for the Fund.    I bad the judgment, maybe wrong, that my colleague&amp; that&#13;
proposal, before it went to the Loan Committee had to paaa the review               I had left behind in the Fund were not all that enthusiastic about the&#13;
of the Economic Committee.      The idea of it was that we would ask                idea of closer relations with the Bank.        The fact that I went over to&#13;
central questions:     What do we think of the development program in the           the Bank, may, if anything, have weakened their desire to collaborate.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 2')                                                                                 26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     A point of clarification:    Are you saying that in the Economic     Projects Department.      1 insisted that the economics of projects had&#13;
&#13;
Co~ittee     in the Bank some~ economists were invited to participate            aleo to be discussed in the Economic Committee.        The diecussion on&#13;
&#13;
in the diecuaaiona?                                                              shadow pricing, for exmAple, waa a discuaaion of the economics of&#13;
                                                                                                                                                 I&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     In virtually all the diacuaaiona.     We never had a discussion    project evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
of a country without having the director, or the acting director, of                       I wanted to have one place where the profeaaional standards of&#13;
&#13;
the concerned area department of the Fund present.        1 always would ask     the Bank in economics were being articulated.         People like Mervin&#13;
&#13;
them to every meeting.     They spoke independently and separately, not          Wiener in Latin America, or Takahashi in Agriculture would come.&#13;
&#13;
just aa observers.     I always requested and always got complete                They were very good participants.         They would raise the iaauea that&#13;
&#13;

OLIVER:     Who from the Bank would be a part of the Economic Committee?         don't remember any difficulties at all in having these people.              We had&#13;

FRIEDMAN:     All the area department and projects department economist&amp;         very lively meetings; well attended; I didn't really have any             proble~&#13;

&#13;
OLIVER:     So it was a pretty large group, thirty, forty people, maybe.         would come and ask me if it was all right if they came too.              It wae not&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     Not quite.   I believe it tended to have very much the same        a question of people trying to get out of it.&#13;

&#13;
fair-haired boy of the President.        I was .the only one he had brought in   Committee and the Economics      Co~ittee    in terms of attendance but also&#13;
&#13;
at a senior level.     Woods made it very clear, I forget exactly how,           in terms of subject matter.        What was.the aingle most important&#13;
&#13;
that he thought the Economic Committee was a great idea and he was all           queation the Loan Committee was trying to answer?        What was the single&#13;

for it.     So I didn't have a problem getting good attendance.                  moat i.portant question the Economics Committee was trying to answer?&#13;

          Sometimes I didn't get the director of the department.       He'd be   FRIEDMAN:     Well, we addressed at leaet two separate questions, equally&#13;
&#13;
off on a loan negotiation, but then he'd send his deputy or his                  important.&#13;

econom~c    advisor.   We had very good attendance, including from the           OLIVER:     ''We" being th~ Economic Collllllittee?&#13;

from the point of view of credit-worthiness, was this country credit-                         aucb-and-auch an afternoon?          I always invited the Fund people and&#13;

an IDA recipient?          So, for example, we had long discussions about                     them that they should please feel free to stay.              Hy   vie~   was that we&#13;

two-thirds of the IDA loans.              I uaed it sa a place where I would bring            colleagues in the Fund.&#13;

of the things that came out of thia innovation was a joint memorandum                         Economic Committee that the Bank wasn't invited to.                They didn't have&#13;

practice of the the Bank ataff inviting Fund people to join our                           invited to join a      ~iasion,    the division of labor based upon the&#13;

&#13;
       I did not follow the World Bank's traditional approach (which                      McNamara did was to aboliah the           Econo~ic   Committee,&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
very large groups of outside people, helped by someone like Andy                          OLIVER:     What was the explanation?&#13;
&#13;
Kamarck, who in the end bad to do        ~uch    of the drafting in the name of           FRIEDMAN:     No explanation that I can recall.             After that we did not&#13;
&#13;
so~e    very distinguished person or persona.         This practice resulted in           have anyone present from the Monetary Fund.              We became like the&#13;
&#13;
ma~oth     reports on Morocco and other countries, which were really very,                Monetary Fund in that there was no mechanism for collaboration of that&#13;
&#13;
very good -- at least, 1 learned a great deal from              the~.   They were         kind.     Collaboration depended on individual situations,                With the&#13;

not, however, staff work in the way that I was accustomed to in the                       abolition of the       Econ~ic co~ittee.         the machinery of the Bank       beca~e&#13;
&#13;
Monetary fund.     I began with the      pr~ise:   we did not want to do that             the annual business budget, discussions by the President's council, or&#13;
&#13;
kind of comprehensive background.          What we wanted to do was to prepare            an expanded group, of the plans of the Bank for the year.                   It was&#13;
&#13;
an economic report that helped us decide what the World Bank and IDA                      called the Program Review Committee,             &amp;~~thing    like that.     It waa at&#13;
&#13;
should do.     That is very different      fr~    a general aurvey.      It has got       those meetings that McNamara preaided.&#13;
&#13;
to be scheduled.       It's got to be   ~anned.     It baa to be finished on                          We bad a   nu~ber   of programs evaluated.          We met, and the area&#13;
&#13;
time.     If, as a matter of fact. the Monetary fund was willing to come                  department director and his staff would come up.                They would state&#13;
&#13;
along and do the chapters on the monetary situation, balance-of-                          t~eir   proposed plana for the year.            They woutd be subject to&#13;
&#13;
payments, analysis and fiscal reduction, so much the better.                  We could    examination by anybody in the           roo~.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
use all the help we could get. and they were            co~petent.                                  At first Andy:Kamarck and I were, in effect, the secretariat of&#13;

of the country program.      So if the country program called for               the operational and the economic side.        I never could get that accepted&#13;

agriculture, for industry, for transportation, then the person within           even when Woods waa there.        I was constantly oppoaed by people who&#13;
the Projects Department was involved.        The director would also be         muttered that economists were meant to be advising, that'a ,â&#128;¢all.&#13;
&#13;
present.     But no longer waa economics the orientation.                       OLIVER:     When you aay the loan group, do you    m~an    people in the area&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Did you ever have the feeling, while the Economic Committee&#13;
&#13;
existed, that any of the area department people or other important              FRIEDMAN:     People in the area departments and also on the Loan&#13;
&#13;
staff people in the Bank were opposed in some aenae to the existence of         Committee.     The Loan Committee consisted of director&amp; of the area&#13;
&#13;
the Economic Committee?                                                         departments and the Personnel Administrator who would say,             '~e   don't&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     Oh, yea.   I mean, there were always muttering&amp;.       The        need that.     That's not our view of economic advisor&amp;."        I uever got&#13;
&#13;
traditional idea that the real power in the Bank waa whoever waa the            wholehearted acceptance for 01y idea of an economic a staff.            But the key&#13;
&#13;
Chair..an of the Loan Committee was no longer true.        There was a          role reaained.      Some were very disappointed when it became clear that&#13;
&#13;
division of power.       In the old days, anything that Dick Demuth suggested   ~y   role was not to be only that of an economic advisor.         Others. of&#13;
was submitted to the Loan Committee.        Anything suggeatedÂ·about projects   course, inclined toward the new approach.&#13;
went to the Loan Committee.      That wae   ~   Committee that did              OLIV!l:     Were you part of the Loan Committee?&#13;
everything.     There waa a great ceutrali&amp;ation of power in the Loan           FRIEDKAM:     No.   I never attended a meeting of the Loan Committee.&#13;
Committee of which Robert Garner wae the        cbai~n   for many years.        OLIVER:     Are there minutes of the Loan Committee?&#13;
People muttered around, I forget their names, but they vere constantly          fRIEDMAN:     I think so.     It was a very formal body.     It had a&#13;
muttering to me about how it used to be aimple:       we just bad to go to      constitutional status in the Articles of Agreement, which was quite&#13;
&#13;
the Loan Committee.      Now we have to go to tbe Economic Committee too.       different from the Economic Committee.&#13;
&#13;
            As an example of the attitude, there wae a lot of talk about                    I never did succeed in making economists deputy-directors.&#13;
&#13;
the positions of economists.       I wanted to elevate the status of            The view prevailed that, after all, they were only economic advisors,&#13;
&#13;
economists.     One of my tboughta had been that the economic advisors of       Some resisted the idea that 1 wanted to have supervision over their&#13;
&#13;
the area departments be made the deputy-directors of the departments.           economic competency.        That waa very clear.   When I made the suggestion&#13;

Fl1EDMAN:     I'd eay within a year.   I don't   r~ember.   It waâ&#128;¢ probably a                The moâ&#128;¢t difficult area was the IDA lepleniabment.            When Burke&#13;
&#13;
short period.     The economics staff, as auch, continued to play a               Knapp and I were in effect put in charge of it, the relations between&#13;
&#13;
vigorous role.                                                                    Burke and myself became much more important.         We were doing a major job&#13;
&#13;
     Of course, the word got around the Bank (in the Woods yearal that            jointly. In aome waya, it was difficult for me. On the one band, I knew&#13;
&#13;
there waa another power.     Executive directors came to me and said, "I Â·        Woods' mind (be thought of ua aa equally responsible), while Burke was&#13;
&#13;
understand you are really the .aat important person in the Bank outside           really, in my own mind, senior to me. I bad a high regard for bia&#13;
&#13;
of Woods."     I knew, fro. my own bureaucratic experience that tbia waa          adminiBtrative responsibility.        Later on, at some point, he became the&#13;
&#13;
the worst thing they could say when I was trying bard to get accepted             eenior vice-president, which was clearly a higher rank than mine.               Yet&#13;
&#13;
by the others.     Then it started -- a very elaborate bureaucratic ga.e.         I knew that in Wooda' mind and later in       KcNam~ra'a     mind, they looked to&#13;
&#13;
In front of Woods, people, who simply refueed to (Ooperate or                     both of us.     McNamara repeatedly told me that he, oddly enough, looked&#13;
&#13;
collaborate in practice, would never disagree with anything that had to           to me even more than to Burke or anyone else to make the IDA&#13;
&#13;
do with me.     Then when it came to imple-entation, tbey aimply refused          Repleniebment    ~ork.   (He asked me pleaee not tell hia other people that&#13;
to collaborate.     Fortunately, thia only happened occasionally.        It       be had told me so.)&#13;
&#13;
happened sometimes wben collsboration waa seen as s aerioua losa or                          Still, when it came to the economic     work,~        waa regarded as&#13;
&#13;
sharing of authority.                                                             my area.     It irritated me, however, when I found that I got no support&#13;
&#13;
     Until Woods decided to leave in '68, from the years '64, '65, '66,           from these colleagues; they weren't on       ~y   aide arguing for the&#13;
&#13;
'67, there never waa an issue which be did not get resolved                       thing.     Woods bad them kind of neutralized; be just didn't pay much&#13;
&#13;
without much fuBa.     Kind you, I stayed out of their fields.        Woods bad   attention to them when it came to my field.          He did pay a lot of&#13;
&#13;
his own discuasionB with Alderwereld and Cbatenay about projects.             I   attention to them when:it      ~ame   to their own fields.     He respected their&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                35                                                                                            36&#13;

&#13;
jurisdiction.            He did not play games.     He would talk to       ~e   about what           Nigeria ao that Woods would understand why this vas          ~portant.&#13;
&#13;
I    Wi!IS   doing.                                                                                  When   McNa~ara   came, the economics work vas aeen more, I think, as a&#13;
&#13;
             He might say that Dick     De~uth   wa$ too sick to work.          Rut he never         kind of backdrop or framework to        decision~aking.     He valued economic&#13;
&#13;
u~ked        me what should be our relations       ~ith th~   United Nations                         analysis.    McNamara vas a   ~       strong supporter of   econom~cÂ·'    research,&#13;
&#13;
Devt&gt;l opuâ&#128;¢t&gt;nt Fund should be.         He respected the fact that Dick Demuth                 ~as   particularly of a quantitative character.           He supported   am~itioua&#13;
&#13;
in charge.            I didn't have anything to do with       th~   Loan   C~ittee.                  programs to do more on the economics of demography, populatiun,&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:         Were minutes kept in the Economic Ca.mittee?                                         agriculture, and so-forth.&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:         Yes.    Another thing we did vas to form a statistical group.                                Woods was more interested in how can we help to get more output&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:         Before you tell about the statistics, is it fair to infer that                       of food in Kenya.      "I hear there's a whole bunch of Swedes.               Can we&#13;
&#13;
Woods was really more           int~rested   in economic analysis than McNamara                      finance their staying there?        They used to be part of the FAO.             They&#13;
was?         Econocâ&#128;¢ic analysis meaning analysis of credit worthiness, analysia                      can lose their jobs.     Barbara [that's Barbara Wardl just told me&#13;
&#13;
of    absorptiv~       ca~acity,   analysis of the success of a development                          they're looking for a way to stay.        Why don't we hire those fellaa1               We&#13;
&#13;
tâ&#128;¢logr&amp;aâ&#128;¢ and it's overall effect on the country?                                                    could.    Wby don't we put    th~   on our payroll?     I don't think the&#13;
&#13;
~'RIEDHAN:        I would not describe their differences this way.                   I think         United States would ever have developed the way they did if they didn't&#13;
&#13;
that Wood's idea of economics was that economics vas a vital part of                                 have the agricultural servicee.        That's what these fellas have been.&#13;
&#13;
the Bank's decision asking day-to-day.               Woods helped us get started in                  These fellal know what to do.        Why don't we hire them?"      That was Woods&#13;
&#13;
population, for example, because he understood that you couldn't                                     notion of how you run the Bank.        Economists were part of the decision&#13;
&#13;
d i Hlâ&#128;¢6!&gt; econou.ic development without discussing population.                   You                making process.&#13;
&#13;
couldn't discuss a loan without knowing something about the country and                              OLIVER:     I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, but it sounds to me&#13;
&#13;
how the loan fitted in.            That was his common sense, his intuitive                          like Woods bad a better idea of the       o~ersll   development proceas, rather&#13;
&#13;
feeliuf. about this.          You've got to really know what you're talking                          intuitively, than McNamara.         It sounds to me like Woods perceived that&#13;
&#13;
about.        That vas the role of the economist.        He'd say,         Â·~at   do these           credit-worthiness and absorptive capacity are enormously important&#13;
&#13;
other fellows know about things like that?"                                                          development concepts, whereas McNamara tended to see things in terms of&#13;
&#13;
             He had a high regard for someone like Andy Kamarck on Africa,                           individual pieces.&#13;
&#13;
becaus~,&gt;     Andy could come in and speak very cogently about Ghana and                             FRIEDMAN:    With Wooda jbe important thing is not tbe product of&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     37                                                                                  38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
research.     For example, I tried to       fo~   an Economic Research Group, a     look at what they're doing?     Somebody ought to go and talk to them.&#13;
&#13;
long-term economic research program.            l got Guy Orcutt to come to work    They want to talk about their inflation.      These loan officers, they&#13;
&#13;
with me.     Guy came up with a fairly elaborate plan.         I could get Woods    can't talk; they don't know about inflation.       Irving, who can go?&#13;
                                                                                                                                                     I&#13;
only to agree, I think, to        si~   or &amp;even economists that would do long-     Jerry Alter?     Oh yea, excellent man, excellent, good man, knows all&#13;
&#13;
te~   research.        His answer waa, ''What do you want that for?"                about what to say.     I've talked to him about it.    Have   him~come    in and&#13;
&#13;
          On the other hand, lrving lravia was doing interesting research           chat with me; very good talking to Jerry Alter; really understands that&#13;
&#13;
at the University of Pennsylvania which was relevant for the Bank. I                stuff."     That's what he'd want.&#13;
&#13;
had no problem getting Woods to help aubaidbe tbia. "Sure, there's                             For Woodsl it waa part of the activities of the Bank, bow you&#13;
&#13;
a~ademi~s.     They've got to have      ~ney.     You tell me he is a good .an,     run the Bank.     Economists understood things about the Bank that non-&#13;
&#13;
and that's good enough for me.          What does he want?    It sounds   good."    economists didn't understand, and, therefore, in order to have a better&#13;
&#13;
In fact he wasn't just going along.          We were getting work done in           decision, you want to have them there.      With Bob, it was more of an&#13;
&#13;
economics by academics, and they didn't have to be on the staff; they               emphasis on long-term projects.      It was like that etudy that projected&#13;
&#13;
weren't part of the decieion .aking process.            He didn't disagree at all   the $800 billion dollar surplus of the OPEC countries.         Woods's idea,&#13;
&#13;
with thie kind of work.                                                             which I shared, was that the economic&amp; of the World Bank is just&#13;
&#13;
      Bob   HcN~ara      was always very impreaeed with the products of             another part of ita operational activities.&#13;
&#13;
quantitative research.         Bob wanted to know the details of a reeearch                    There~   non-operational economic&amp; in the World Bank, which is&#13;
project. What was the expected outcome?           For Woods, credit-worthiness      your   long-te~   research -- where you're trying to improve your&#13;
&#13;
waa something decided by the Bank etaÂ£Â£ on a country-by-country basis.              understanding of countries.      But on a day to day baaie, an economist ia&#13;
&#13;
It kept changing as time went on.          For McNamara, it was the product of      just as much an operating officer ae a loan officer or a projects&#13;
a research project.         It resulted in preciee rating&amp; of countries and         officer.     They're all doing the operations or the activities of the&#13;
&#13;
precise    ~neasuree    and ratios.   For Woods, it was "That's fine, that's        Bank, but bringing different professional skills to it.         That's what I&#13;
&#13;
what a professor ought to do."          He was always, as I say, friendly           think inepired Wooda.      He said, "You know if it weren't for the IDA&#13;
towards giving 111oney to acadelllica outside the Bank to do such tbinga,           Replenishment, I wouldn't have any economist&amp;.        I wouldn't have you or&#13;
&#13;
but in the Bank he wanted his economists thinking, "Who's going to go               Cairncroas."      It wasn't to make a big study.   I was the one who&#13;
&#13;
down and talk to those fellows in Brazil and those fellowa in Chile and             suggested the study on:capital requirements.       I don't think he wae&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
particularly interested, but he waa very interested in my memorandum on&#13;
&#13;
wh~   I thought a billion dollar   replenis~ent    could be juatified and&#13;
what argument&amp; I would make to juatify it.        He thought I could do it;&#13;
be repeatedly alluded to that -- that non-economiata could not have&#13;
written that memo.&#13;
OLIVER:     What I can't tell ia whether Wooda used    econ~ics   more or&#13;
&#13;
Woods used economics leaa than McNamara did.&#13;
&#13;
FliEDHAN:     I think that they used it differently.     I think they had a&#13;
&#13;
different view of it.     I don't think it's fair to eay, or correct to&#13;
&#13;
aay, that McNamara didn't use economics.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVEt:     Well, thank you for tbeee insights,    We muat do it again aoon.&#13;

            In March 1974, July and December 1985,
            June 1986, and February 1988, Irving S. Friedman was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Robert W. Oliver and Charles Ziegler.
            During his tenure at the Bank from 1964 to 1974, Mr.
            Friedman worked as an economic advisor to the president of
            the World Bank (1964-1970); as chairman of the economic
            committee (1964-1970); and at the Economic Development
            Institute (EDI) as professor in residence (1971-1974). His
            transcripts exist as a seven volume set, consisting of one
            session in 1974 and eight sessions from 1985 to 1988. His
            transcript concerns his tenure at the Bank after working for
            the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He was appointed by
            George Woods as his economic advisor. He discusses in detail
            the relationship of the IMF and the World Bank and
            propagating that development. .
