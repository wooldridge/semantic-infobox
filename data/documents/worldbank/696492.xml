1. ECONOMIC CONTEXT AND&#13;
HIGHER EDUCATION IN INDONESIA&#13;
A. ECONOMIC CONTEXT&#13;
1.1   After a quarter century of rapid economic structural transformation, Indonesia has become&#13;
more diversified, less dependent on oil, more industrialized, more urbanized, increasingly driven by&#13;
private initiative and more integrated into the global economy. Since 1970, the Indonesian economy&#13;
has grown at an average real rate of over 6% per year, significantly faster dtan the average rate of&#13;
population growth, which has steadily declined and which is presently estimated at 1.70/o p.a. As a&#13;
result, income per capita has increased rapidly and is expected to surpass US$1,000 equivalent by the&#13;
turn of the century. The benefits of such growth have been felt by a growing proportion of the&#13;
population, reflected in a decrease in the number of people living below the poverty level from 70&#13;
million in 1970 to 26 million in 1994 (60% and 14% of the total population in the respective year).&#13;
With higher incomes has come an increased demand for education from both consumers (i.e., children&#13;
and their parents) and from users (i.e., employers).&#13;
B. THE EDUCATION SECTOR IN INDONESIA&#13;
1.2    A contributing factor both to rapid economic growth and to the decline in poverty was the&#13;
country's early success, at a time when per capita income levels were still low, in universalizing&#13;
primary education. By the early 1980s, the country had attained a net enrollment rate of over 900/. in&#13;
primary education and is now making efforts to improve the quality of primary education, through&#13;
improvements in teacher training and universal provision of textbooks. Girls account for almost 50% of&#13;
primary enrollments. Having virtually achieved universal primary education, the Government set the&#13;
goal of achieving universal lower-secondary education by the Year 2010, and has requested the help of&#13;
the Bank and others in achieving this goal. In addition, it intends gradually to increase access to upper-&#13;
secondary education. With these efforts to expand and improve secondary education, the demand for&#13;
higher education can be expected to grow rapidly. Indonesia presently has a well-balanced education&#13;
system, with 1993-94 gross enrollment rates of 111%, 54%, 34%, and 11% in primary, lower-&#13;
secondary, upper-secondary, and higher education, respectively. These participation rates compare&#13;
favorably with those of other countries at a similar level of GDP per capita and are also respectable&#13;
relative to those in the wealthier, newly industrialized economies of East Asia. &#13;
C. THE HIGHER EDUCATION SUBSECTOR&#13;
1.3   At Independence in 1945, Indonesia's higher education institutions enrolled approximately&#13;
2,000 students. Currently, the higher education sector consists of about 2.5 million students enrolled&#13;
in 77 public institutions and over 1,200 private institutions, representing approximately eleven percent&#13;
of the 18-24 age group. During the 1960s, and continuing into the 1980s, the Government's strategy&#13;
was to expand access to public higher education. It accomplished this partly through establishing at&#13;
least one university in each province. This policy not only ensured some measure of regional equity,&#13;
For example, 1992 gross enrollments in tertiary education were 7% in Malaysia, 19% in Thailand, 20% in&#13;
Hong Kong, 28% in the Philippines, and 42% in the Republic of Korea.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
but also provided all provinces with a local source of teachers, civil servants, professionals, technical&#13;
specialists, and managers. The expansion was planned and managed from the center, in response to (a)&#13;
the need for nation-building over a vast territory composed of many different ethnic and linguistic&#13;
groups, (b) social demand for education services from the regions, and (c) the lack of adequate&#13;
implementation capacity at local levels. The period between 1960 and 1990 was witness to an increase&#13;
in demand for higher education, from both consumers and users, at a much faster rate than the public&#13;
sector was willing or able to provide. This resulted in phenomenal growth in the private provision of&#13;
higher education with the number of private institutions increasing from 17 to over 900.&#13;
1.4   In the mid 1980s, when the present system of public universities was in place, and the private&#13;
sector had become a major provider of higher education, there was a gradual shift in the Government's&#13;
higher education policy to an increased emphasis on quality improvement. Investments in public&#13;
universities focused on the provision of quality-upgrading.  Government investment remained&#13;
important in disciplines with large investment costs (engineering, natural sciences) in which the private&#13;
sector was reluctant to invest. Over time, as the relative importance of the public sector as the primary&#13;
provider of higher education has decreased, the relative importance of the public sector as the primary&#13;
employer of university graduates has also declined, and that of the private sector has increased.&#13;
Although the Government's policy is to let the private sector respond to most of the increasing demand,&#13;
the Government is also aware that higher education provides social as well as private benefits and that&#13;
the public institutions of higher education provide externalities such as research and community service&#13;
which are not currently provided by private-sector institutions.&#13;
1.5    The current higher education system consists of approximately 1,400 institutions of higher&#13;
education, of which over 1,200 are private, about 100 are service academies belonging to other&#13;
Ministries, and 77 are public institutions operated by the Directorate-General of Higher Education&#13;
(DGHE) within the Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC). Although they account for only about&#13;
5% of the total number of institutions, the public institutions account for about 35% of total&#13;
enrollments, with the remaining 65% enrolled in private institutions and service academies (Annex 1,&#13;
Tables I and 2, sets forth student enrollment by type of institution).&#13;
1.6    The 77 public institutions of higher education (Annex 1, Tables 3 &amp; 4) are considered superior&#13;
in quality and performance to the private institutions. Of these, four--the University of Indonesia in&#13;
Jakarta, the Bandung Institute of Technology, the Bogor Agricultural University, and Gajah Mada&#13;
University in Yogyakarta--are recognized to be the country's premier institutions of higher education&#13;
with large, established graduate and undergraduate programs. Of the remaining institutions, six&#13;
(including three teacher training institutes) offer graduate programs, seven are teacher training&#13;
institutes with no graduate programs, 26 are considered less-established universities and were&#13;
established within the last 30 years, 26 are polytechnic institutes, two are technical teacher training&#13;
colleges, five are institutes of the arts, and one is an open university.&#13;
1.7    The over 1,200 private institutions comprise a wide variety of academies, schools of religion,&#13;
colleges, institutes, and universities and cater to some 1.5 million students. Many of these institutions&#13;
are quite small, offering only one or a few programs.  Course offerings tend to be limited to law,&#13;
religion, the humanities, and the social sciences. Most private institutions serve as second-best options&#13;
for university students who have been unsuccessful in obtaining a place in one of the public institutions&#13;
and most suffer from a lack of facilities, materials, qualified teaching staff, and resources for&#13;
investment. Less than 100 of the private institutions operate at a level comparable in quality to the&#13;
average public institution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.8    Regional equity in access to higher education has largely been attained due to the&#13;
Government's decision in the 1960s to have at least one public institution in each of the 27 provinces.&#13;
Gender equity is steadily improving. In 1992, women constituted 36% of undergraduates and 46% of&#13;
diploma-program students, with increasing proportions of women among the new intake every year.&#13;
Social equity has been much more difficult to achieve. Higher education is expensive: tuition fees in&#13;
the public institutions range from US$100 equivalent to US$400 equivalent per year; in private&#13;
institutions, fees range from US$100 equivalent to US$1,000 equivalent per year. To these tuition fees&#13;
must be added laboratory and other fees; off-campus living expenses; books; and transportation&#13;
between the university and home. Tuition may, in fact, account for only 15-20% of the total direct cost&#13;
of higher education to the student. Even without any calculation of opportunity costs, the total direct&#13;
cost of higher education in Indonesia may amount to US$500 to US$5,000 per year, whereas the per&#13;
capita income in 1994 was only US$880 equivalent, indicating that most tertiary students, in both&#13;
public and private institutions, come from Indonesia's better-off families. Various student support&#13;
schemes exist, such as scholarships, tuition waivers, and work-study programs, but these benefit only&#13;
2-3% of the total number of students. A student loan scheme was tried several years ago but was&#13;
abandoned because it was difficult to recover the loans. Given the perceived urgency and importance&#13;
of the benefits to society of a greater number of high-quality graduates in priority areas, the&#13;
Government now provides scholarships, through a variety of targeted programs, to some 50,000&#13;
students annually, accounting for only about three percent of the total number of students. The overall&#13;
efficacy of efforts within the higher education subsector to provide greater access to children from&#13;
poorer families is constrained by the fact that most children from poorer families presently do not&#13;
complete secondary school.2 In addition, it has proved virtually impossible to target scholarships to&#13;
those few children from poorer families who do complete secondary school.&#13;
1.9   Indonesia's higher-education system is characterized by levels of cost-recovery which are&#13;
among the world's highest and continue to rise. Private financing constitutes over half of total&#13;
expenditures on higher education. In public institutions, cost recovery from student fees has risen by&#13;
over 200%/o in real terms in the past five years, and the universities continue to raise them on an annual&#13;
basis. Tuition fees in public institutions, although generally much less than those charged by private&#13;
institutions, are still significant. Public universities differentiate fees among the various disciplines,&#13;
charging more for those disciplines which require laboratory work. In the school year 1993/94, almost&#13;
200/ of recurrent costs were recovered through student tuition and fees, while an additional 5% was&#13;
generated by other income-generating activities within the individual institutions. The share of higher&#13;
education within total government expenditures on education has declined from 17% in 1989 to about&#13;
13% at present. The annual unit recurrent cost for students in Indonesia's public higher education&#13;
system is US$870,3 which is lower than those of countries such as Thailand (US$2,210) and the&#13;
Philippines (US$ 975). The overall average cost per graduate is US$5,470.&#13;
2   The Government's long-term strategy for overcoming this problem is, as stated in para. 1.2, to universalize&#13;
lower-secondary education and gradually to increase access to upper-secondary education. The lower-&#13;
secondary-education program includes special efforts to attract and retain children from poorer families.&#13;
3   This unit recurrent cost was calculated taking into account both public expenditures (government budget) and&#13;
private expenditures (student fees) but does not include other direct costs to the student. The average annual&#13;
unit recurrent cost for students in Indonesia's private institutions of higher education is about USS250&#13;
equivalent,&#13;

D. ISSUES IN HIGHER EDUCATION&#13;
1.10   Although Indonesia's system of higher education has come to exhibit many desirable features,&#13;
such as active private-sector participation and high levels of cost recovery, its institutions are sfill&#13;
developing, and there are still important problems in both public and private universities relating to&#13;
quality, efficiency, relevance, and management.&#13;
1.11   Quality. The Government is concemed with raising the quality of higher education so that&#13;
Indonesia may compete in the international marketplace. There are several factors which constrain&#13;
improvements in quality. One is the generally low level of qualification of teaching staff. Only 30&#13;
percent of staff in public institutions and eleven percent of staff in private institutions hold S2 and S3&#13;
degrees4 (see Annex 1, Table 5). As recently as 1995, the large majority of new teaching staff held&#13;
only S I degrees. At present, many institutions of higher education, both public and private, are actively&#13;
trying to recruit new teaching staff who hold advanced degrees. In part, the problem is one of supplv:&#13;
only a few institutions of higher education in Indonesia offer graduate programs, and the domestic&#13;
production of graduates with advanced degrees is low. However, the problem is also one of demand.&#13;
since salaries of teaching staff are low, relative to salaries for employment in other economic sectors.&#13;
1.12   The base-pay level of teachers' salaries in public institutions is set by civil service guidelines.&#13;
A few of the best public institutions supplement their teachers' civil service salaries with income&#13;
generated by the institution itself, but most institutions, particularly the less-established ones, have&#13;
limited resources for this purpose. As part of its dialogue with the Bank, the Government has been&#13;
examining the possibility of raising salaries for teachers in public institutions, in order to make such&#13;
positions more attractive and more competitive with jobs in the private sector. However, if salaries are&#13;
increased for teachers, then other civil servants who are not teachers but who have similar&#13;
qualifications would also expect to receive higher salaries. In private institutions, teachers are, in&#13;
general, hired by the hour, at rates which are similar to those paid in nearby public institutions which&#13;
are usually the source of the teaching staff in private institutions. Due to their low levels of&#13;
remuneration, most teaching staff cannot focus full-time on teaching or research at their home&#13;
universities, but must find additional ways of supplementing their incomes. It is estimated that well&#13;
over half of teaching staff in public institutions take on second jobs as teachers at private institutions, as&#13;
workers in private companies, or as independent consultants, or accept offers of employment from&#13;
other government agencies. The time taken up by the job outside the home university, whether public&#13;
or private, leaves little time for teaching, maintaining or enhancing skills, or providing guidance to&#13;
4   The SI degree is equivalent to a Bachelor's, the S2 to a Master's, and the S3 to a Ph.D.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
students. Because of second and third jobs, the number of hours teaching staff spend per week&#13;
teaching students, in both public and private institutions, is low. All of the above factors impact&#13;
negatively on quality.&#13;
1.13   Several other problems with teaching staff which have a negative impact on quality should be&#13;
mentioned. Fir  in degree programs, critically important disciplines for economic growth, in both&#13;
public and private institutions, tend to be understaffed, with the humanities and social sciences typically&#13;
far better staffed than the sciences and engineering. Second since the deployment of teaching staff in&#13;
public universities is still govemed by national civil service regulations, staff positions are line budget&#13;
items, and as a consequence, university managers have litde autonomy or flexibility in determining the&#13;
profile of their staff.  University managers cannot easily reallocate staff intemally from  low-&#13;
priority/low-demand fields to high-priority/high-demand fields. The only room for maneuver comes&#13;
from new recruitment, and even those are tied to specific fields. Third, since the total number of staff&#13;
in public universities is determined by the center instead of by the university, there is litde incentive for&#13;
universities to reduce the number of staff. Fourth, the level of funding for research, although&#13;
increasing and in principle available to support research at both public and private universities, is in&#13;
fact still very limited in public universities and practically non-existent in private universities. In public&#13;
universities, although competition for research funds has been introduced in recent years, some small&#13;
research grants are still often distributed among all faculty without competition or based on&#13;
qualifications or the quality of their research proposals. Finally, staff are not always held accountable&#13;
for their actions. For example, regulations exist governing the number of student contact hours per&#13;
week staff are supposed to have, but they are difficult to enforce and are often ignored.&#13;
1.14  In addition to these problems with teaching staff, several other factors have a negative impact&#13;
on the quality of undergraduate education. Laboratory facilities are inadequate in most institutions,&#13;
particularly in private institutions, and library holdings, even in the best institutions, are limited. Still&#13;
another factor impacting on the poor quality of undergraduate education is the poor quality of&#13;
secondary school graduates a problem which the Government (with assistance from the Bank and&#13;
others) is presently trying to address. Except for in a few elite institutions, quality problems are more&#13;
serious in the private sector, which have fewer resources, are dependent on part-time staff, primarily&#13;
from public institutions, have few incentives to invest in additional facilities and equipment, and attract&#13;
lower-quality entrants.&#13;
1.15   Efficiency. Although the undergraduate program should be completed in four years, typical&#13;
undergraduates in both public and private institutions take from five to six years to complete their&#13;
studies. While this is an improvement over earlier years, efficiency gains could be made by&#13;
encouraging students to complete the cycle more quickly. In addition, low student-teacher ratios of&#13;
about 12 to 1, limited utilization of physical space, and the low number of student/staff contact hours&#13;
per week (para. 1.12) also contribute to low internal efficiency. Efficiency gains could also be achieved&#13;
by consolidating programs in areas like the social sciences, where the bulk of students tend to be&#13;
studying.&#13;
1.16 Relevance. The Government is concerned that the present higher-education system is not&#13;
providing graduates in the fields which will be most needed by an economy that is growing rapidly and&#13;
changing structurally. One indicator of this mismatch between the output of the higher-education&#13;
system and the needs of the economy is the long waiting period between graduation and employment.&#13;
A recent tracer study of graduates from ten universities confirmed that many, particularly those who&#13;
studied humanities and social sciences and those from universities located in regions where economic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
development has been slower, find it difficult to find employment and may face long waiting periods of&#13;
up to three years before they obtain formal employment.&#13;
1.17  There are several reasons for the poor match between universities' output and employers'&#13;
needs. In the private sector, private demand for degrees in law, teacher training, and humanities is still&#13;
strong enough that private institutions do not have to change their course offerings to attract students.&#13;
In the public sector, there are structural rigidities which hinder better adaptation to market needs. First&#13;
although administrators at public universities are gaining more experience in academic planning,&#13;
linkages to demand are still weak. Second the present centralized decision-making structure gives&#13;
individual universities little opportunity in their academic planning to create programs of study to&#13;
reflect local students' or employers' needs. Third. many universities are saddled with a large stock of&#13;
permanent staff who do not teach the subjects or disciplines needed for employment in the new growth&#13;
fields. Finally until now, most institutions, both public and private, have had little interest in the&#13;
placement of their students and few, if any, institutional mechanisms to keep track of where graduates&#13;
have found jobs or assist their graduates in finding employment. For all these reasons, students often&#13;
receive an education which is not relevant to the constantly changing needs of the economy.&#13;
1.18   Management. The way the system is presently managed has had negative impacts on the&#13;
quality, efficiency, and relevance of higher education in Indonesia. There are problems both at the&#13;
central level, where managers lack knowledge of local needs and conditions, and in the institutions&#13;
themselves, where managers lack capacity and experience. Management problems are primarily&#13;
responsible for mismatches between needs and the ways investment funds are actually spent. For&#13;
example, many universities exhibit excessive physical capacity in some disciplines and shortages in&#13;
others. University administrators complain of books selected and procured by the center which arrive at&#13;
the university and are not needed or used. Similarly, they complain of equipment selected and&#13;
procured by the center which arrives at the university and is found to be incompatible with existing&#13;
equipment, lacks accessories, and cannot be serviced locally. It is clear that these imbalances result&#13;
both from the fact that investment decisions were made by the center, with inadequate knowledge of&#13;
local needs, and from unrealistic investment proposals prepared at the university level by managers and&#13;
staff possessing limited capacity. Decision-making patterns have encouraged university administrators&#13;
to blame the center for their problems and to attribute suboptimal results to the lack of local power&#13;
rather than to their own lack of capacity and experience.&#13;
1.19   A lack of autonomy and local responsibility has resulted in a lack of accountability and&#13;
transparency at the institutional level. In many universities, planning and administration are top-down,&#13;
with teaching staff and department administrators not adequately consulted or informed. Teaching&#13;
staff and lower-level administrators complain that they have little information on the sources or use of&#13;
the university's budget, particularly for maintenance. It is not easy to hold university managers&#13;
accountable, since the same constraints which apply to the hiring and deployment of teaching staff also&#13;
affect the selection of university managers.&#13;
E. ISSUES AFFECTING LESS-ESTABLISHED PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES&#13;
1.20   Of the 77 public institutions of higher education, the older, more established universities have&#13;
reached a level of maturity and development where they compare well with universities in other East&#13;
Asian developing countries. The 26 younger, less-established public universities, however, are still in&#13;
the pioneer phase of their development. Some of these were established for reasons of regional equity&#13;
(19 are located in the Outer Islands, which are defined as islands other than Java, Sumatra, and Bali),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
while others were established in secondary towns in heavily populated provinces where there was an&#13;
un-met demand for higher education and where the Government hoped to promote regional poles of&#13;
development (three on Java and four on Sumatra). The issues described in the preceding section-&#13;
quality, efficiency, relevance, and management--although to some extent a problem for all public&#13;
universities, are particularly pronounced at these 26 less-established universities. The 26 have the&#13;
potential to play an important role in regional development, both in human resource development and in&#13;
applied research, to meet the needs of the local public and private sectors. For these institutions, the&#13;
most pressing issues are (1) to define realistic missions and goals which focus on selective&#13;
development responsive to local needs, and (2) to channel available resources to the highest-priority&#13;
programs to ensure minimum levels of qualified teaching staff, library materials, and laboratories.&#13;
1.21  In the 1980s, many of these less-established universities began ambitious campus development&#13;
plans involving large amounts of civil works and equipment. These programs have by in large not yet&#13;
been completed. Often, the original Master Plan was overly ambitious and not based on good academic&#13;
planning.5 The consequence of this may be unrealistically generous space allocations for those&#13;
faculties and administrative offices that already have their buildings and the inability to fund adequate&#13;
facilities for the rest. There have been complaints that generous administrative office space has been at&#13;
the sacrifice of adequate office space for teaching staff which is needed for interaction with students,&#13;
class preparation and private study to maintain and upgrade personal skills. Although private&#13;
institutions have since developed near these 26 public universities, they are for the most part, staffed by&#13;
teachers from the public universities and would not be able to survive without them. The academic&#13;
qualifications of the teaching staff in the public and private institutions has not yet reached adequate&#13;
levels. Over the longer term, the 26 newer institutions must demonstrate that they have an important&#13;
role to play in their respective locales, or risk losing their accreditation.&#13;
F. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY FOR HIGHER EDUCATION&#13;
1.22  Indonesia has embarked on a comprehensive reforn of the higher education sector aimed at&#13;
reducing the role of the state and decentralizing the financing of public higher education. The&#13;
government realizes the need to (i) train a highly skilled labor force to compete internationally in the&#13;
production of high value-added products and services, which requires constant technological progress;&#13;
and (ii) ensure greater efficiency of the university sector in the use of public resources and create&#13;
financial incentives for improvement. The Government has requested Bank support in designing&#13;
structural reforms in this sector.&#13;
1.23. The Director General of Higher Education took the first step in the reform process with the&#13;
establishment of The Higher Education Strategy Task Force in February 1995. Its task was to&#13;
conceptualize the strategy for higher education in Indonesia for the coming decade. The result was a&#13;
concept paper entitled The New Paradigm, which (a) redefines the roles of the center and of the&#13;
individual institutions of higher education, (b) focuses on educational outcomes, and (c) provides new&#13;
mechanisms to enhance university-level, decentralized planning and performance-based resource&#13;
allocation. Under the New Paradigm, the role of the central Government will be reduced in scope, if&#13;
not in importance. The central Government's role will be to set the rules of the game, direct resources&#13;
to high-priority areas, encourage both public and private institutions to raise their standards, and&#13;
provide funds for those purposes where there is a market failure. The main themes of the emerging role&#13;
for the public sector include (a) greater decentralization of management for the public system, (b) a&#13;
5  Some universities are aware of this and have modified the Master Plan to better reflect their realities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
continuing role as direct provider of higher education in less-developed regions and in high priority&#13;
fields, (c) an increased emphasis on economic considerations in deternining where public funds should&#13;
be invested, and (d) an important role in enhancing quality in both public and private institutions&#13;
1.24   To implement the New Paradigm, the Government plans to strengthen institutional capacity&#13;
both at the center and at individual universities. At the central level, the Government has established a&#13;
new Board of Higher Education (BHE),6 supported by a permanent Secretariat, to which key&#13;
personnel have been assigned. The BHE is composed of various stakeholders including representatives&#13;
of private-sector employers, the Ministry of Education, the National Planning Board, the academic&#13;
community (both public and private institutions), the National Research Council and the National&#13;
Advisory Board on Education. The BHE has the responsibility to assist the DGHE in four areas: (a)&#13;
overseeing the higher education system by making recommendations on higher education policies,&#13;
identifying local and national needs and new programs to be financed, and providing a medium- to&#13;
long-term perspective to the DGHE; (b) providing competitive funding for research and graduate&#13;
education through the existing University Research Council (URC), which was established to assist the&#13;
implementation of the Bank-supported URGE Project (para. 2.5) and which is to be merged into the&#13;
BBE; (c) establishing competitive funding mechanisms for undergraduate education and implementing&#13;
projects (including the proposed project) which support such activities; and (d) providing technical&#13;
assistance and training to institutions of higher education to strengthen their capacity for decentralized&#13;
academic planning and management.&#13;
1.25 While recognizing that public and private institutions face different problems, the Government&#13;
sees that both types of institutions need an incentive to raise quality. One important step to this end is&#13;
the recent establishment of a National Accreditation Board (Badan Akreditasi Nasional--BAN)7&#13;
which will, for the first time, periodically inspect and accredit programs of study and institutions of&#13;
higher education, both public and private, and make the results public. BAN is intended to increase&#13;
transparency in the Indonesian higher education system, to guide users, to ensure accountability, and to&#13;
strengthen incentives for individual universities to increase quality standards, efficiency and relevance.&#13;
The decree named BAN's chairman, secretary, and 17 other members, who are recognized individuals&#13;
representing a variety of stakeholders including private-sector employers, the academic community&#13;
(both public and private institutions), and the Government. BAN's Board meets twice a month.&#13;
BAN's Secretariat has also been established, with office space in the MOEC and several professional&#13;
and support staff. BAN's mandate was reviewed by Indonesia's Parliament in mid-February 1996 and&#13;
given approval to proceed. At the national level, the Board is to grow to 36 members (12 subject&#13;
panels of three members each). Twelve regional task forces throughout the country will be responsible&#13;
for carrying out actual evaluations. These regional task forces will be staffed by individuals similar in&#13;
background to those on the national panels. They will be appointed for two-year terms, with half being&#13;
replaced each year. At full operation, the task forces will consist of some 100 people. By February&#13;
1996, BAN had developed accreditation instruments in fields including medicine, law and engineering&#13;
and has pre-tested them in several public and private universities. Over the next five years (the period&#13;
of the proposed project), BAN will establish accreditation mechanisms and will conduct accreditation&#13;
for the more than 1,400 institutions of higher education, both public and private, and for the more than&#13;
13,000 programs of study through sector-wide desk evaluations and site visits.&#13;
6   In Indonesian, Dewan Pendidikan Tinggi (DPT). DPT/BHE was established by Ministerial Decree No.&#13;
0121/U/1996 on May 6, 1996.&#13;
7  BAN was established by Ministerial Decree No. 0326/U/1994 on December 15, 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.26   Under the New Paradigm, individual public institutions of higher education will be given the&#13;
power and the responsibility to behave more as if they were private-sector institutions. To obtain&#13;
investment funds from the center, they will be required to undertake self-evaluation, prepare&#13;
institutional development plans tailored to their own specific needs, and develop budgets based on&#13;
projected resources and priority needs. Hand in hand with this new autonomy will come greater local&#13;
responsibility and accountability: the universities will no longer be able to blame their problems on the&#13;
center. In the medium to long term, the Government expects to grant financial and academic autonomy&#13;
to all public institutions of higher education. It plans to implement this policy gradually, however,&#13;
beginning with the less-established universities which, precisely since they are less established, are&#13;
more innovative and more open to change. In the first phase of implementation of the New Paradigm,&#13;
the Government has encouraged the less-established universities to compete among themselves for&#13;
limited investment funds. Over time, this competition will be extended to all institutions of higher&#13;
education, private as well as public.&#13;
1.27   By establishing a clear framework for accountability, the New Paradigm also encourages&#13;
private institutions of higher education to become more efficient and improve their quality. The&#13;
accreditation process will publicize information pertaining to the quality of individual study programs&#13;
and institutions, both public and private, and consumers (potential students and their parents) will be&#13;
able to make their own judgments as to the value offered for the price. In a competitive environment,&#13;
both public and private institutions will either have to demonstrate to students and their parents that&#13;
they offer a relevant, high-quality education worth paying for and leading to good employment&#13;
prospects or else lose "customers" and, ultimately, disappear. The Government has explicitly&#13;
recognized that competition entails losers as well as winners, and that in the long run, some public as&#13;
well as private institutions may prove economically unjustified and may not survive.&#13;
1.28  In short, the Government is in the midst of a paradigm shift intended to improve the quality,&#13;
efficiency, relevance, and management of the country's institutions of higher education.  The&#13;
implementation of the New Paradigm will entail substantial changes in the mode of operation within&#13;
individual universities and in the overall legal, regulatory, and financial controls on universities&#13;
heretofore set by the center. Although it is realized that such changes will require substantial capacity-&#13;
building, including upgrading the academic qualifications of the teaching staff, as well as commitment&#13;
and involvement at all levels, the Higher Education Strategy Task Force recognizes that in the context&#13;
of the New Paradigm, the individual institutions can make many quality and efficiency improvements&#13;
without significant new investments. The proposed project is the first step in the reform process.&#13;

2. BANK INVOLVEMENT AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
A. PREVIOUS BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.1    With 22 education projects approved in Indonesia since 1970, of which 15 have been&#13;
completed and seven are under implementation, the Bank has a long-standing and varied experience in&#13;
supporting all levels of education in Indonesia (Annex 2). The present education portfolio of seven&#13;
projects with the MOEC includes projects in primary education, secondary education, higher education&#13;
and non-formal education. Bank assistance to higher education in Indonesia has supported the&#13;
Government's strategy for higher education as it has changed and developed over the years in response&#13;
to the changing needs of the society and the economy: initially, Bank-supported higher education&#13;
projects supported the expansion of higher education, particularly in selected fields of high national&#13;
priority, then focused on quality improvement. Of ten past and two ongoing projects supported by the&#13;
Bank which had at least some components related to higher education, the five projects described&#13;
below have the greatest relevance for the proposed project.&#13;
2.2   The First and Second University Development Projects.    The First University&#13;
Development Project (Loan 1904-IND), approved in 1980, supported investments to raise the quality&#13;
and quantity of graduates in selected fields at three public universities, to develop graduate programs,&#13;
and to strengthen university management. The project was successful in achieving its targets, but it&#13;
was recognized that a project of such narrow scope could have only a very limited impact on both&#13;
quantity and quality of output. The Second University Development Project (Loan 2547-IND),&#13;
approved in 1985, supported the establishment of new graduate-level programs in selected fields of&#13;
study and research through the establishment of 16 new Inter-University Centers (IUCs) in emerging&#13;
scientific and technological fields. The project also initiated five undergraduate programs in fields of&#13;
study which were unavailable in Indonesia at the time. This project was successful in meeting its&#13;
targets, and most of the IUCs have become centers of excellence in Indonesia. A 1995 Project&#13;
Performance Audit Report prepared by OED states that "achievements in institution building have&#13;
been substantial; the new IUCs could become the focus of future efforts to upgrade the entire&#13;
university system."&#13;
2.3   The First and Second Higher Education Development Projects (HEDP I and II). The&#13;
second wave of Bank-supported higher education projects were the First and Second Higher Education&#13;
Development Projects (Loan 2944-IND and Loan 331 1-IND), which were approved by the Board in&#13;
1988 and 1991, respectively. These two projects financed three-year time slices of broad-based&#13;
sectoral programs to address a wide range of issues, including expansion of access in selected fields,&#13;
interventions to improve quality, university teaching staff development, and capacity-building in&#13;
university management. The preparation and supervision of these projects enabled the Bank to carry&#13;
on a continuous dialogue with the Government, both on policy issues and implementation problems.&#13;
One successful outcome of these sectoral interventions was the development of a pilot competitive&#13;
grant scheme to support university research activities. This experience led to the Government&#13;
establishing a larger multi-year research grant program with its own resources.&#13;
2.4   The First and Second University Development projects and HEDP I and II have been&#13;
completed. With the completion of these projects, the next cohort of Bank projects in higher education&#13;
in Indonesia will reflect the movement of government away from direct management of universities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
toward a more decentralized management approach. Bank support for movement in this direction in&#13;
fact began with the University Research for Graduate Education Project.&#13;
2.5    University Research for Graduate Education Project (URGE). The URGE project (Loan&#13;
3754-IND), approved by the Board in 1994, seeks to (i) increase competitive funding for domestic&#13;
graduate education and university research activities, (ii) strengthen the procedures for selecting grant&#13;
and fellowship proposals, (iii) integrate university research with graduate training in universities, (iv)&#13;
strengthen research capacity and dissemination of research findings in universities, and (v) attract&#13;
highly qualified candidates for domestic graduate education. Successful outcomes of this ongoing&#13;
project have been the development of competitive grant and fellowship programs, which increase the&#13;
attractiveness of domestic graduate programs, and the development of the University Research&#13;
Council, whose functions are to administer all DGHE grant and fellowship programs for graduate&#13;
education and research as well as to provide policy advice on the development of graduate education&#13;
and research capacity.&#13;
B. LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
2.6   The first twenty years of Bank lending in Indonesia for education were reviewed in a 1991&#13;
OED report entitled Indonesian Education and the World Bank: An Assessment of Two Decades of&#13;
Lending. While the report does not focus specifically on higher education, there are valuable lessons to&#13;
be drawn from it. In addition, the recent 1995 Performance Audit report on the Second University&#13;
Development Project (Loan 2547-IND) provides guidance on improving higher education projects in&#13;
Indonesia The Bank Best Practice paper for higher education, approved by the Board in 1994, entitled&#13;
Higher Education: The Lessons of Experience, has a number of relevant recommendations for this&#13;
project. Finally, there are lessons to be learned from the experience with higher education projects&#13;
described in supervision and project completon reports.&#13;
2.7    OED Report. The OED report from 1991 had nine conclusions: (1) education should be&#13;
relevant to the labor market, (2) fellowship programs could be made more effective, (3) national&#13;
capacities should be created and strengthened, (4) sector work should be the basis of policy&#13;
discussions, (5) successful sector lending rests on a solid empirical base, an effective policy dialogue,&#13;
consistency between Bank and Government objectives, and satisfactory implementation procedures, (6)&#13;
the pursuit of equity should not lead to an attempt to spread benefits too widely, (7) projects should be&#13;
compact and uncomplicated, (8) the Government should increase its financial commitment to the&#13;
education sector, and (9) private education will continue to play an important role and warrants Bank&#13;
support. The proposed project (1) seeks to make the programs at the selected universities more&#13;
relevant to the labor market, (2) builds on and enhances existing natonal capacities, (3) is based on a&#13;
number of studies carried out under HEDP II, (4) has some aspects of a sector loan which are based on&#13;
the four criteria mentioned above, (5) focuses its most expensive interventions on needy, less-&#13;
developed universities, and (6) is compact and coherent. The project is not being used as a vehicle for&#13;
increasing the Government's financial commitment to the education sector. Finally, although private&#13;
universities would not be targeted for investments under the proposed project, they would be covered&#13;
through the project's quality-enhancing interventions and through the introduction of competitive&#13;
funding mechanisms in the context of the New Paradigm. In addition, the ongoing URGE Project&#13;
(para. 2.5) allows private institutions to compete for funds under the project.&#13;
2.8   Project Performance Audit Report. The 1995 Project Performance Audit Report cited above&#13;
(para. 2.2) on, the Second University Development Project recommended that quality improvement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
efforts be extended to other universities rather than continuing only with the 16 included in that project.&#13;
It also reiterated the 'heed to shun complexity in large projects, specifically when they have a strong&#13;
element of innovation." Finally, it suggested that a system where institutions of higher education&#13;
would compete for funding might be the future of efforts to enhance the quality of higher education in&#13;
Indonesia All of these findings have been reflected in the design of the proposed project.&#13;
2.9   Bank Best Practice Paper for Higher Education.  While recognizing the difficulty of&#13;
generalizing from the experience of very diverse experiences from throughout the developing world,&#13;
this paper contains four broad recommendations: (1) encourage greater differentiation of institutions,&#13;
(2) provide incentives for public institutions to diversify sources of funding, and link government&#13;
funding closely to performance, (3) redefine the role of government in higher education, and (4)&#13;
introduce policies explicitly designed to give priority to quality and equity objectives. The proposed&#13;
project (1) encourages individual institutions to specialize according to their perceived strengths and&#13;
local needs, (2) provides incentives for competing institutions to maximize self-generated income, and&#13;
links central-government grants to performance under agreed development plans, (3) supports a&#13;
redefinition of the role of government in higher education (the New Paradigm), and (4) includes&#13;
specific incentives designed to improve quality. Although the proposed project has been designed to&#13;
support less-established universities in underserved regions, it does not include specific measures to&#13;
improve social equity, in recognition of the fact that this problem first needs to be addressed at the&#13;
lower levels of education, as is being done in ongoing Bank-supported projects and in the proposed&#13;
Bank-supported projects in lower-secondary education being prepared concurrently.&#13;
2.10  Previous Bank Experience with Higher Education Projects in Indonesia. Past Bank assistance&#13;
in higher education operated within the existing paradigm and hence focused on supply-driven and&#13;
input-based investments that were sector-wide in application. This sector-wide approach had some&#13;
positive results. Both HEDP I and HEDP II were successful in providing universities with better-&#13;
trained staff and more adequate facilities as well as in developing implementation capacity, including&#13;
capacity to undertake major procurement. Still, it has become evident that providing inputs does not&#13;
necessarily lead to their effective use; merely designing an information system or training university&#13;
managers is not sufficient to build a planning and management culture in a university. The proposed&#13;
project therefore moves away from sector-wide investments towards focused investments in those&#13;
universities which have demonstrated their worthiness through open competition, while simultaneously&#13;
changing the government's role and sector framework in which universities will operate.&#13;
C. BANK STRATEGY AND RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.11   Bank Strategy. The design of the proposed project is consistent with the Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on March 21, 1995. The CAS supported some important&#13;
trends which were emerging within Indonesia's development strategy, most notably, a shift towards a&#13;
more decentralized, participatory approach to development in which the Government's role would be&#13;
to provide an enabling and regulatory framework but move away from direct provision of services. In&#13;
addition, the CAS welcomed the Government's continued emphasis on human resource development&#13;
to promote continued economic growth, competitiveness, and structural transformation. Finally, the&#13;
CAS emphasized the importance of more selective, efficient use of public resources. The design of the&#13;
proposed project is also consistent with the Bank's strategy of balanced assistance to the education&#13;
sector, which includes ongoing and proposed assistance for (a) improving the quality of primary&#13;
education, including possible additional interventions in early childhood development, (b) expansion&#13;
and quality improvement of lower-secondary education, (c) quality improvement of upper-secondary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
education, (d) selective interventions in higher education, and (e) an active policy dialogue designed to&#13;
redefine and refocus the Government's role in the education sector.&#13;
2.12  In the higher education sector, specifically, the Bank's strategy is to support the Government's&#13;
introduction of the New Paradigm, which means a change from the previous supply-driven, centrally&#13;
managed, sector-wide approach towards a more demand-driven, decentralized, focused approach.&#13;
Future Bank-supported investments in higher education would be based on the further application of&#13;
competitive principles intended to encourage institutions (both public and private), departments, and&#13;
individuals to function more efficiently and effectively. In addition, projects would be carefully targeted&#13;
to those regions and disciplines where the private sector is not providing, and is not expected to&#13;
provide, the mix of graduates required for the economy's continued growth, development and&#13;
transformation. The proposed project would include a domestic graduate fellowship component for&#13;
teaching staff development as a bridging measure.&#13;
2.13   Foflow-up Operations. The Government of Indonesia has expressed a strong interest in&#13;
developing a series of projects of similar design. A possible DUE HI would invite proposals from a&#13;
selected group of less-established universities and possibly teacher training institutes and technical&#13;
training teacher colleges. Concurrently, the Government may seek Bank support for a Quality for&#13;
Undergraduate Education (QUE) Project, under which departments and faculties in selected priority&#13;
fields from any university could compete for funding to improve their educational processes and&#13;
outcomes in undergraduate programs. Additionally, the DGHE has suggested that a follow-up project&#13;
to URGE be considered if the mid-term review of the ongoing project indicates that it is achieving its&#13;
objectives.&#13;
2.14  Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank is a trusted partner in higher education in&#13;
Indonesia and has substantial experience working with the Indonesian Government in this sector. The&#13;
proposed project represents the culmination of a dialogue, which has taken place over the last several&#13;
years, on the appropriate role of the Government in higher education. This dialogue led, first, to the&#13;
URGE Project (para. 2.5), for which the Government articulated a competitive and decentralized&#13;
strategy for supporting graduate research, and, secondly, to the development of the New Paradigm&#13;
which redefines the role for the central government, emphasizes competition, and encourages greater&#13;
autonomy for individual institutions. The Govemment has expressed its desire that the Bank aid this&#13;
reform with financial and technical assistance.&#13;
3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND PERFORMANCE INDICATORS&#13;
3.1   The project has three objectives: (a) to improve the quality of undergraduate education, as&#13;
indicated by an increase of 10% in the mean score on the Benchmark Test and an increase of five&#13;
percent on the National University Entrance Examination score of students at the six target universities;&#13;
(b) to improve the efficiency of the educational process, as indicated by a decrease from the current&#13;
average time to graduate of 5.75 years to 5.25 years at the six target universities; and (c) to improve the&#13;
relevance of the study programs offered, as indicated by a decrease in the mean job search time of&#13;
graduates from the estimated current average waiting time to employment of 1.75 years to 1.5 years for&#13;
the graduates of the six target universities. Achieving these three objectives would lead to increased&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
earnings for graduates of the six target universities. The project would seek to achieve these three&#13;
objectives by supporting the first phase of the implementation of the New Paradigm, which redefines&#13;
the role of the central government in higher education, decentralizing responsibility to individual&#13;
institutions.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.2    The project will support (a) a first phase of activities at the institutional level as well as (b)&#13;
supporting activities at the sector level. Proposed interventions at the institutional level would focus on&#13;
six of the less-established public universities, where the needs for improved quality, efficiency, and&#13;
relevance, as well as improved managerial capacity, are greatest, and which, because of their location,&#13;
are seen as potential contributors to regional economic development. Proposed interventions at the&#13;
sector level would support the central government's new role in (i) overseeing the higher-education&#13;
system, (ii) regulating quality, and (iii) enhancing the quality of university teaching staff.&#13;
3.3    Component 1:   Universities Development Program  (US$63.3 million, not including&#13;
contingencies). Under the project, block grants would be provided to six universities to enable them to&#13;
cany out their development programs to strengthen undergraduate education. During negotiations,&#13;
the Government agreed to provide grants to the target universities in accordance with&#13;
procedures and on conditions agreed with the Bank. The grants would finance fellowships for&#13;
teaching staff, training for teaching and administrative staff, teaching and research grants, technical&#13;
assistance through visiting scholars, books, journals, teaching materials, equipment, and limited civil&#13;
works for the rehabilitation and upgrading of facilities. Investments under this component are targeted&#13;
at consolidating existing educational capacity with individual universities' strategic plans and would&#13;
provide resources enabling universities to plan new investments while capitalizing on earlier&#13;
investments. Each eligible university was asked to establish a Task Force chaired by the university's&#13;
First Vice Rector and staffed by young academics, to ensure their involvement in the planning and&#13;
preparation process. To obtain support, each eligible university was required to evaluate its existing&#13;
programs and resources and then to prepare a viable five-year plan including: (i) specific proposals to&#13;
improve the quality of teaching and to increase the efficient use of instructional inputs; (ii) the relevance&#13;
of institutional missions and objectives to regional development needs; (iii) the feasibility of&#13;
institutional priorities in light of social demand and staffing profile, as reflected in applicants and&#13;
enrollments, class size, and staff work load; (iv) consolidated budget plans that show a commitment to&#13;
the use of self-generated discretionary resources to maintain and operate new investments; and (v) a&#13;
commitment to reward staff for their teaching, particularly those individuals receiving fellowships from&#13;
project funds.&#13;
3.4    The universities to benefit under this component were selected through a competitive selection&#13;
process, reviewed and approved by the Bank, described in Annex 3. Under this selection process, 17&#13;
of the 26 less-established universities were invited to prepare and submit funding pre-proposals on the&#13;
basis of clearly defined criteria which were reviewed and approved by the Bank. The 17 pre-proposals&#13;
were reviewed and evaluated by an independent peer panel appointed by the Director-General of&#13;
Higher Education, and ten were pre-selected. The pre-selection process, including the development of&#13;
guidelines for self-evaluation, was highly participatory and included policy dissemination workshops&#13;
and training seminars with all potentially involved universities. The ten pre-selected universities were&#13;
then asked to submit full-fledged proposals in accordance with the detailed guidelines and selection&#13;
criteria reviewed and approved by the Bank. Proposals were received on February 10, 1996. The peer&#13;
panel completed the evaluation process, which included site visits to all ten universities, in March&#13;
1996. The DGHE provided the Bank with the results of the final evaluation, including (a) the names of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
the selected institutions," (b) a revised implementation plan for this component, (c) revised costs for&#13;
this component, and (d) draft grant agreements with the selected universities. During negotiations&#13;
the Government (a) agreed to implement the Universities Development component according to&#13;
the implementation plan, (b) provided assurance that there would be a clause in the grant&#13;
agreement that the selected universities must have established both their indicator baselines&#13;
and their final targets, and (c) agreed to monitor each of the indicators throughout the project&#13;
implementation period.&#13;
3.5   Stakeholder participation has been, and will continue to be, ensured at all levels of the selection&#13;
process--from the identification of selection criteria, which was caried out by a Task Force whose&#13;
membership included representatives from the universities, to the actual implementation of the&#13;
investment plans, which would be carried out individually by the selected universities. While the&#13;
DGHE has the overall responsibility for approving the new regulatory framework and for reviewing the&#13;
funding proposals by the individual universities, project design and implementation arrangements have&#13;
been completely decentralized. This approach enables individual universities to determine their own&#13;
needs and targets, but will also hold the universities fully accountable for their performance and for&#13;
achieving their stated objectives and targets. In particular, each university's progress in implementing&#13;
its proposal will be reviewed annually by BHE and DGBE, and a grant agreement for the upcoming&#13;
year will be renewed only if progress has been satisfactory.&#13;
3.6    Component 2: Institutional Capacity-Building in Higher Education (US$6.4 million, not&#13;
including contingencies).  The development of the capacity of the recently created Board of Higher&#13;
Education (para. 1.24) would be supported under the project through the provision of technical&#13;
assistance, staff training, policy studies, equipment for the BHE Secretariat, incremental operating&#13;
costs, and workshops and technical assistance at individual institutions of higher education (Annex 4).&#13;
The BHE will use an existing management information system for monitoring higher education.&#13;
Lessons learned from the implementation and evaluation of the proposed project will be applied to&#13;
future higher education policies and practices. The Government has provided the Bank with the formal&#13;
Ministerial decree establishing the BHE, including its chairman (the Director-General of Higher&#13;
Education), members, and functions, the operating guidelines for BHE, and the implementation plans&#13;
and costing of BHE activities. The Government has also allocated sufficient office space to the BHE&#13;
Secretariat within the MOEC, devised a suitable plan for re-assigning sufficient number of qualified,&#13;
full-time staff to the BIHE Secretariat, and issued terms of reference for these staff. During&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Government will maintain the BHE and its&#13;
Secretariat in accordance with terms of reference, staffing, and resources acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. Furthermore, it was agreed that grant agreements with the selected universities would&#13;
designate the BHE as the body responsible for monitoring and evaluating progress against the&#13;
targets specified by each university and recommend to DGHE any ameliorative actions.&#13;
3.7    Component 3: Implementation of a National Accreditation System for Higher Education&#13;
(UJS$10.0 million, not including contingencies). The project would support the consolidation of BAN&#13;
from its present initial state to full operation, strengthening its capacity to establish accreditation&#13;
mechanisms and carry out the accreditation of institutions of higher education and of study programs in&#13;
such institutions. Technical assistance, short-term staff training in administration and program&#13;
evaluation, training of peer reviewers, equipment, renovation of office space, and incremental recurrent&#13;
costs including funding for site visits would be provided under this component. Cost recovery will be&#13;
The following six institutions were selected: UNILA (Lampung), UNRI (Riau), UNS (Sebelas Maret), UNIB&#13;
(Bengkulu), UNEJ (Jember), and UNDANA (Nusa Cendana).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
introduced when the first round of accreditation has been completed (Annex 5). The DGHE has&#13;
prepared. and provided to the Bank, BAN operating guidelines, a workplan for the BAN, terms of&#13;
reference and a staffing plan for the BAN Secretariat, and a plan detailing how and over what time&#13;
period BAN would evolve to its full operational capacity. During negotiations, assurances were&#13;
obtained that the Government will implement the BAN component according to the guidelines,&#13;
plans, and terms of reference provided to the Bank.&#13;
3.8    Component 4: Competitive Domestic Fellowship Program (US$9.9 million, not including&#13;
contingencies). A key quality issue in Indonesian higher education is the low qualifications of teaching&#13;
staff. This component would address the issue of quality by supporting a competitive fellowship&#13;
program enabling 1,000 recent SI graduates, or present teaching staff with SI qualifications, to pursue&#13;
Master's degrees at Indonesian universities. Fellowship recipients would be bonded to teach in the 27&#13;
less-established public universities. In the longer run, the Government intends to re-examine the&#13;
incentives for attracting and retaining highly qualified people as teachers. During negotiations, the&#13;
Government agreed to carry out a comparative analysis of the remuneration and incentives&#13;
structure for university teaching staff, with a view to determining the best combination of&#13;
fellowships, increased remuneration, and/or other incentives for attracting and retaining qualified,&#13;
effective people as university teachers. Not later than October 30, 1997, the recommendations of&#13;
the comparative analysis will be furnished to the Bank for comments, and promptly thereafter,&#13;
the Government will prepare and carry out an action plan taking into account the comments of&#13;
the Bank on the recommendations.&#13;
3.9    Component 5: Project Administration (US$2.4 million). This component finances the Central&#13;
Project Coordinating Unit (CPCU). The CPCU will be responsible for monitoring and assisting the&#13;
LPIUs in implementing their respective projects and for collecting and analyzing data from the target&#13;
universities. During negotiations, the Government agreed to maintain the CPCU throughout&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
C. ALTERNATIVE PROJECT DESIGNS AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
3.10   During project preparation, a number of issues related to the design and effectiveness of this&#13;
project were reviewed. These included: (a) the appropriateness of the Government's priorities in the&#13;
education sector; (b) investment altematives, and the criteria used to choose among them; (c) expected&#13;
economic returns; and (d) the appropriateness of the incentive structure built into the project design for&#13;
achieving the project's objectives.&#13;
3.11   Government Priorities in the Education Sector. The Government of Indonesia's policies&#13;
seem to be broadly appropriate. Indonesia first focused on the universal provision of primary&#13;
education, where economic retums were the greatest. It is now focusing on universalizing access to&#13;
junior secondary education, where there is also a strong economic justification for expansion.9 The&#13;
Indonesian economy is also exhibiting, however, a strong demand for higher education, evidenced by&#13;
substantial wage differentials between tertiary and non-tertiary graduates. Most of the demand is being&#13;
9  The Bank is supporting the expansion of junior-secondary education with a series of projects, of which the&#13;
first is expected to be approved in FY96.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
met by the private sector". Recent Govemment policy in the higher education sector is undergoing a&#13;
shift toward high levels of institutional autonomy and self reliance and toward quality and relevance of&#13;
study programs in public universities. Regional comparisons suggest that Indonesia lags behind in&#13;
terms of overall investments in education and that other countries in the region are approaching OECD&#13;
quality standards.&#13;
3.12   Investment Alternatives. (i) The possibility of a sector-wide program of inputs, similar to&#13;
those used under HEDP I and HEDP It, was considered--and rejected--in view of the need to shift the&#13;
focus away from inputs and towards outputs and impact. (ii) A second altemative considered was to&#13;
assist the Government of Indonesia to undertake an overall reform of the higher education financing&#13;
system, as suggested in a Bank-commissioned paper on financing higher education in Indonesia"&#13;
This approach was, however, judged to be unimplementable at present because it would require reform&#13;
of the entire civil-service system. (iii) Another alternative discussed was to subsidize individual&#13;
demand by providing fellowships, loan schemes, or vouchers to needy students, rather than making&#13;
block grants to institutions. This alternative was considered inferior to the chosen alternative, for&#13;
several reasons. In the first place, most needy students in Indonesia drop out of the educational system&#13;
well before they reach the university, so an intervention of this sort in higher education is not yet&#13;
warranted. In the second place, whereas there may be some rationale for fellowships, subsidizing&#13;
demand without efforts to improve the attractiveness of the regional universities could result in a brain&#13;
drain towards Java, with none of the positive extemalities for regional development accruing from&#13;
efforts to upgrade the regional universities. In the third place, recent research12 concludes that before&#13;
emphasizing funding mechanisms such as vouchers, there needs to be improvement in the broad policy&#13;
environment in which universities operate. A fourth reason for rejecting the option of loan schemes is&#13;
the weakness of the financial system and the difficulties in ensuring repayment. (iv) The possibility of&#13;
including a larger number of universities in the pilot phase was considered and rejected on grounds of&#13;
cost and absorptive capacity.&#13;
3.13   Based on discussions with the Government, three changes in the original project concept for an&#13;
BEDP II follow-up project were made. It was agreed: (i) to move beyond what was done in HEDP I&#13;
and to introduce a competitive fellowship program for recent SI graduates to enhance the quality of&#13;
university teaching staff; (ii) not to include the accelerated engineering program, mainly because the&#13;
thrust of the proposed project is to encourage local institutions to make their own investment decisions,&#13;
rather than promoting expansion to meet nationally planned targets;'3 (iii) for the reasons cited in&#13;
paragraph (ii) above, not to include, in this project, support for the nationwide university library&#13;
network.&#13;
10 Although most of the incremental demand for higher education is being met by the private sector, most of the&#13;
incremental demand for science and engineering is being met by the public sector.&#13;
See Albrecht, 1994.&#13;
12  A recent publication by Ziderman and Albrecht, 1995, Financing Universities in Developina Countries&#13;
concluded that before emphasizing funding mechanisms such as vouchers and cost recovery to increase the&#13;
efficiency of higher education, there needs to be improvement in the broad policy environment in which&#13;
universities operate.&#13;
13 It is also important to note that at this time, implementation of an Asian Development Bank-financed project&#13;
to support engineering education in Indonesia has begun. Subsequent Bank-supported projects in higher&#13;
education might also fund improvements in engineering education, if needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3.14   Economic returns.  The major quantifiable benefits from  the project result from  the&#13;
investments made in the universities that are selected for funding. Until the selection process is&#13;
completed, it will not be possible to provide estimates of the economic retums based on the finalized&#13;
investment program. However, indicative returns that are likely to be close to the final retums can be&#13;
calculated, based on the information contained in the final proposals submitted by the ten universities&#13;
on the short list (Annex 3F).&#13;
3.15   Based on the information provided in these ten proposals, the estimated economic return is&#13;
24%. The details of the calculations and an analysis of the sensitivity of the estimates to the&#13;
assumptions are provided in Annex 6.&#13;
3.16   As no estimates of the positive extemalities from public investment in higher education are&#13;
available, the increase in earnings resulting from the investment is taken as a measure of the social&#13;
benefits of the investment. This increase is obtained through three effects: (a) a reduction in the time&#13;
students take to graduate; (b) a reduction in the waiting time for a job once they graduate; and (c)&#13;
increased eamings once they are employed. The largest contribution to total benefits arises from the&#13;
increased salary after employment (81 percent), followed by the benefits from reducing the time to&#13;
graduate (11 percent) and the benefits from having fewer graduates waiting for employment at any one&#13;
time (8 percent). Even though the effect of the project on the monthly eamings of any one graduate are&#13;
small (US$10), there are many graduates who would benefit. Moreover, the benefits would be&#13;
received for many years. Reducing the time needed to graduate makes a significant difference to the&#13;
total number of students who pass through the system. In 20 years, roughly seven percent more&#13;
students would graduate if the mean time to graduate were to decline from 5.75 to 5.25 years, with no&#13;
change in the number enrolled at any given time. Reducing the number of graduates waiting for&#13;
employment generates a large per graduate savings because the opportunity cost of having a potential&#13;
worker idle is substantial (roughly $1,460 per year).&#13;
3.17   System-wide effects can be expected if project investments increase not only the absolute level&#13;
of quality of the universities selected for funding, but also their quality relative to other public and&#13;
private universities. In the short run, more qualified students from less-established regions may then&#13;
go to local universities instead of to universities in Java. The expansion of their choice set results in an&#13;
unambiguous gain for the more qualified students in the less-established regions. Since places in&#13;
universities are rationed in Java, this would free up more positions for students from Java who would&#13;
otherwise have gone to private universities. Their retums to education would be expected to rise as&#13;
well, since econometric analysis suggests that the retums to public university education are roughly&#13;
nine percent higher than for private university education. Provided the reduction in time to graduate&#13;
allows the more qualified students to be absorbed into the less-established universities without&#13;
displacing students, there would be no groups that lose with the investments. However, if, because of&#13;
the rationing in public universities, less-qualified students from less-established regions must attend&#13;
private less-established universities, they would be expected to receive lower retums.&#13;
3.18   In the short to medium term, there is likely to be a supply response from the private universities&#13;
as they improve their quality in response to the improvements in quality in public universities. Part of&#13;
the improvement in quality of the private university would be obtained virtually automatically. Because&#13;
the private universities hire most of their staff as part-time lecturers drawn from public universities,&#13;
increases in the quality of public university faculty will result in increases in quality of private school&#13;
faculty.&#13;

3.19  Incentive Structure. The changes to the investment allocation process being introduced in the&#13;
New Paradigm and implemented in this project introduce incentives to improve quality and efficiency&#13;
that, heretofore, have been lacking. The process being followed is described in detail in Annex 3, but&#13;
the important features are described below:&#13;
1. Universities must compete for investment funds.&#13;
2. Investment proposals are prepared after a self-evaluation that must include a discussion of&#13;
program relevance, academic atmosphere, intemal management, sustainability and&#13;
efficiency. The self-evaluation also discusses the institution's strengths, weaknesses,&#13;
opportunities and threats.&#13;
3. The investment proposals must meet standards set by the Board of Higher Education.&#13;
4. Universities must contribute some of their own discretionary funds to the proposed&#13;
activities.&#13;
5. The Board of Higher Education and the Universities will agree on specific performance&#13;
indicators against which progress will be measured. The amount, timing and conditions of&#13;
future funding decisions will depend upon performance.&#13;
3.20   The beneficial effects of the incentives are heavily dependent upon the criteria which will be&#13;
used to evaluate the investment proposals and on what happens to the flow of funds from altemative&#13;
sources. Technical assistance on setting evaluation criteria and evaluating proposals has been provided&#13;
during project preparation and will continue under the project. Funding allocations from all sources&#13;
would be carefully monitored during the project to ensure that the universities that win the competition&#13;
receive more than they would have in the absence of the competition.&#13;
3.21   Although the Bank considers the institutional changes to be important, it is difficult to provide&#13;
ex ante an estimate of the expected net benefits. However, it is worth noting that any improvements in&#13;
the allocation process could have sizable retums since the total investment budget (DIP budget) for&#13;
public universities in 1995/1996 was roughly US$ 202 million. It is also worth noting that the&#13;
measures being introduced parallel some of the initiatives promoted by the Bank in its own efforts to&#13;
improve the design of projects and to ensure that the investments achieve their desired impacts.&#13;
3.22   The introduction of an accreditation system is also expected to lead to positive net benefits,&#13;
although again it is difficult to quantify them. The benefits would come through two effects. First, the&#13;
threat of not being accredited would induce both public and private universities to improve their&#13;
quality. Second, the information provided from the accreditation system could help prospective&#13;
students avoid making poor investments.&#13;
3.23   The BIHE and the BAN will pay close attention to the relation between the phasing of the&#13;
accreditation and investment programs. If standards for accreditation are set without regard for the&#13;
investments that are required to reach the standard, an excessive number of universities could be&#13;
declared substandard. This could induce students to leave or not apply to universities declared&#13;
substandard and could, thereby, harm the development of the less-established public universities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

D. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
3.24   Organizational Structure. The Directorate General of Higher Education (DGHE) under the&#13;
Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC) will have overall responsibility for overseeing project&#13;
implementation. The National Accreditation Board (BAN) and the Board of Higher Education (BHE)&#13;
will be responsible for implementing their respective parts of the project. At the level of the six&#13;
individual target institutions, implementation responsibility will lie with Local Project Implementation&#13;
Units (LPIUs) which have evolved out of the University Task Forces which prepared the individual&#13;
universities' proposals. At the central level, a small Central Project Coordinating Unit (CPCU) located&#13;
within the BIHE Secretariat within DGHE will be responsible not for implementing the project, as in the&#13;
past, but only for providing training, monitoring, and technical assistance to the LPIUs. The CPCU is&#13;
de facto already established in the form of the existing Project Preparation Team within DGHE (see&#13;
Annex 7). The main relations between the DGHE and other implementing bodies are shown in Chart&#13;
1. Project implementation arrangements are described in detail in the Project Implementation Plan,&#13;
which is being circulated separately.&#13;
3.25  Implementation Schedule. The project would be implemented over about five and one half&#13;
years, as shown in Annex 7. For the six target universities, the five-year plan presented in each&#13;
winning university's proposal will be set forth in a five-year grant agreement between DGHE and the&#13;
individual university. The implementation performance of each target university would be monitored&#13;
frequently and evaluated annually, on the basis of the agreed proposal and the university's own targets&#13;
as set forth in the proposal, to determine whether the grant could be continued or even expanded, or&#13;
whether it should be delayed, reduced, or revoked, depending on the implementation performance in&#13;
the respective year.&#13;
E. MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
3.26   A key feature of the project is that failure to achieve performance targets in any one year,&#13;
influences both the development strategy and the level of investment in subsequent years for each&#13;
university. As it will take some time for the investments to have an impact, over the first three years&#13;
the performance targets appearing in the grant agreements will be process indicators included to track&#13;
whether the investments are being carried out as planned. Targets will be set for each of the major&#13;
categories of activities financed under the Universities Development Program--civil works, equipment,&#13;
libraries, staff development, technical assistance, research grants, teaching grants, and project&#13;
management. The particular values of the targets can only be set once the universities to be funded are&#13;
selected and investment plans are finalized.&#13;
3.27   For the fourth and fifth years of the project, the performance targets that could trigger a&#13;
response are either directly related to impact or expected to be highly correlated with impact. Four key&#13;
project performance indicators would be used to monitor and evaluate the overall impact of the project.&#13;
To monitor quality, the BIE has developed an Institutional Benchmark Test which would be&#13;
administered annually to all students in the priority programs at the six target universities. It is expected&#13;
that by the fourth year of the project, the mean score of students taking the Benchmark Test will have&#13;
increased by 10% over the scores at the beginning of the project. To measure changes in the relative&#13;
attractiveness of the university, the scores on the National University Entrance Examination (UMFTN)&#13;
of those students enrolling in the six target universities will be compared to the scores of all students in&#13;
the respective province who take the UMPTN. If the universities could attract the relatively better&#13;
students from their own province, this would suggest that the relative attractiveness of the university&#13;
has increased.. By the end of the fourth year, the ratio of enrolled students test scores to those of all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
students from the province should have increased by 5 percent. To monitor efficiencv, the target&#13;
universities and the CPCU would monitor the average time to graduate and the extent of dropouts. By&#13;
the fourth year of the project, the mean number of years required to graduate would be expected to&#13;
decline from 5.75 to 5.25 years. Dropouts would be measured as the percentage of those who begin&#13;
the academic year but do not complete it. By the fourth year of the project , the percentage of students&#13;
who drop out should decrease by five percent. Finally, to measure relevance, the target universities and&#13;
the CPCU will monitor mean job search time of graduates. By the fourth year, average waiting time to&#13;
employment will decline from 1.75 years to 1.5 years. Baseline information is being collected and will&#13;
be available when the universities' final proposals have been evaluated. Monitoring would be done&#13;
through the existing education monitoring system.&#13;
3.28   The time required to graduate and the waiting time to a job are directly related to the economic&#13;
rate of return (para. 3.15). Monitoring the time required to graduate is relatively inexpensive as the&#13;
data are already being collected. Monitoring the waiting time to a job is more expensive for it requires&#13;
tracer studies of graduates. The monitoring of the waiting time is justified not because it has&#13;
particularly large effect on the overall economic rate of return of the project, but because it is expected&#13;
to be correlated with the quality and relevance of the education. Previous tracer studies in Indonesia&#13;
have found that graduates in the more highly paid fields, who went to universities generally considered&#13;
higher quality, had shorter-waiting times to employment.&#13;
3.29   The major determinant of the economic rate of return is the effect of the project on earnings&#13;
once employed. The project does not use an effect on earnings as a performance target for several&#13;
reasons. First, there is no reliable way of estimating what earnings of the graduates of the university&#13;
would be in the absence of the project. In contrast to investments made in secondary education where&#13;
other schools that do not receive the investment may serve as an adequate control group, in this case&#13;
there is no adequate control group. Using the earnings of university graduates of previous years as a&#13;
control group is only legitimate if there are no significant changes in the socioeconomic conditions.&#13;
Second, even if an adequate counterfactual estimate could be constructed, the impact could not be&#13;
measured soon enough to serve as a performance target for the fourth and fifth years of the project. As&#13;
the effect of the project on earnings must be achieved through improvements in quality of the students&#13;
and improvements in allocative efficiency, the project uses the two quality indicators and the waiting&#13;
time to employment as proxies.&#13;
3.30   The performance indicators have been selected so as to minimize any possible adverse&#13;
incentive effects. For example, using the time to graduate alone as a performance indicator provides&#13;
the incentive to pass students through the system quickly, without regard to quality. Specifying&#13;
performance indicators related to quality provides a check on this incentive.  Similarly, using&#13;
performance indicators based on quality alone provides an incentive to restrict entry to the university,&#13;
perhaps to the point where there would be excess capacity. The check on this incentive is that&#13;
universities would lose tuition revenue, an important source of discretionary revenue.&#13;
3.31   The performance indicators used by the Bank to monitor impact will also be used by the Board&#13;
of Higher Education and the six target universities to monitor satisfactory progress in the investment&#13;
programs. In addition, a larger number of indicators, set forth in Annex 8, would be used during&#13;
project supervision by the CPCU and the LPIUs as well as by the Bank to monitor project&#13;
implementation performance. At the six target universities, both physical indicators (civil works&#13;
completed, equipment procured, number of fellowships awarded, etc.) and education indicators (mean&#13;
student grade point average, percent of faculty with advanced degrees, etc.) would be monitored, as&#13;
would financial and management indicators. Other indicators would be used to monitor progress in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
establishing the BBE and making it operational, as well as following its output (e.g., production of a&#13;
long-term strategy for the higher education sector). Similarly, progress in establishing the BAN and&#13;
making it operational would be monitored, as would the number of study programs and universities&#13;
evaluated and accredited.&#13;
3.32   Annual Progress Report.  The CPCU will prepare, with the support of the BHE&#13;
Secretariat, the BAN Secretariat, and the LPIUs, annual reports at the end of every Government&#13;
fiscal year, summarizing: (a) the status of the programs being implemented by the selected less-&#13;
established universities based on the agreed indicators; (b) the activities of the BAN based on the&#13;
agreed input, process, and output indicators; (c) summaiy activities of the BIHE, including information&#13;
on the agreed indicators; (d) implementation progress and problems during the preceding year; and (e)&#13;
a revised implementation plan for the following year, setting out the measures recommended to ensure&#13;
the efficient carrying out of the Project and the achievement of project objectives during the following&#13;
year. During negotiations, the Government agreed to prepare such annual reports under terms&#13;
of reference satisfactory to the Bank and to furnish them to the Bank by June 30 of each year,&#13;
beginning June 30, 1997, and until completion of the project.&#13;
3.33   Mid-Term Review. In addition to the annual reports, the Secretariat of the BHE, assisted by&#13;
the CPCU, would prepare a mid-term review of the project. This review would integrate the results of&#13;
project monitoring and evaluation activities, including progress achieved in implementing the project,&#13;
and would set out the measures recommended to ensure the efficient carrying out of the project and the&#13;
achievement of project objectives during the remaining life of the project. The Mid-Term Review&#13;
would include, inter alia, (a) an assessment of the effectiveness of the BAN and its activities and (b)&#13;
the progress of the six target universities in carrying out their individual proposals.  During&#13;
negotiations, the Government agreed to carry out, under terms of reference satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank, such a mid-term review, to prepare and furnish to the Bank a report on the review on or&#13;
about June 30, 1999, to review the report with the Bank on or about September 30, 1999, and to&#13;
take all measures required to ensure the efficient completion of the Project and the achievement&#13;
of project objectives, based on the conclusion and recommendations of the report and the&#13;
Bank's views on the matter.&#13;
3.34  Implementation Completion Report. At the completion of the project, the Secretariat of the&#13;
BIE, assisted by the CPCU and the LPIUs, would compile an Implementation Completion Report&#13;
within six months of the closing date of the loan. This report will summarize, among other things, (a)&#13;
program activities in terms of input, process and output indicators for all project components; (b)&#13;
assessment of BAN effectiveness; (c) the project financial status; and (d) implementation issues and&#13;
recommendations.&#13;
3.35   Supervision Plan. The proposed supervision plan is set forth in Annex 9. Bank Resident&#13;
Staff in Indonesia (RSI) would provide day-to-day liaison with the CPCU and LPIUs and would help&#13;
resolve problems requiring immediate Bank action. Bank supervision missions from headquarters,&#13;
with RSI participation, would be conducted twice a year. It is anticipated that Bank involvement in&#13;
supervision will be straightforward because the CPCU will undertake continuous and detailed&#13;
supervision of the LPIUs' activities, which will include frequent site visits, training, and technical&#13;
assistance. Bank supervision missions will review this process, with visits to each of the six less-&#13;
established universities once a year.&#13;
&#13;

F. STATUS OF PROJECT PREPARATION&#13;
3.36    At the central level, the Project Preparation Team  consists of faculty members from  selected&#13;
public universities and is headed by the Dean of the Faculty of Computer Sciences at the University of&#13;
Indonesia. The team includes several officials who have had extensive experience in previous Bank-&#13;
assisted projects; these people have been selected to occupy key implementation posts in the CPCU for&#13;
the proposed project. At the university level, each of the six target universities has designated key&#13;
members of its Task Force to be the core of the university's LPIU. University administrators, teaching&#13;
staff, and students, as well as provincial and local government officials and other stakeholders are fully&#13;
aware of the shift in higher education policy, due to their participation in workshops conducted during&#13;
project preparation.&#13;
4. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
A. COSTS&#13;
4.1     The total cost of the project is estimated at US$102.1 million equivalent (Rp 229.2 billion),&#13;
including physical and price contingencies. Table 4.1 summarizes the estimated cost by project&#13;
component. Detailed costs by year, purpose and component are provided in Annex 11.&#13;

4.2     Bases of Cost Estimates. Baseline costs are estimated at February 1996 prices.  Costs for&#13;
international and domestic consultants are in line with recent education projects for appropriately&#13;
qualified experts. Unit costs for domestic fellowships range from US$4,000 to US$5,400 per staff-&#13;
year for long-term programs. Costs of overseas training and fellowships range from US$12,500 per&#13;
visit for short-term training to US$27,000 per staff-year for long-term programs. Operational costs are&#13;
consistent with current government practices and recent education projects. The size of each university&#13;
development grant program was estimated based on the grant proposals submitted by target&#13;
universities, which were based on individual universities' strategic plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
4.3    Contingency Allowances. Project costs include a contingency allowance of US$10.1 million&#13;
equivalent, 11 percent of the baseline costs, for unforeseen physical conditions and for estimated price&#13;
increases. Physical contingencies (US$2.0 rnillion equivalent) represent about 2 percent and price&#13;
contingencies (US$8.1 million equivalent) about 9 percent of baseline costs. Price contingencies have&#13;
been calculated at 6 percent per year for local costs and at 2.4 percent for foreign costs for all&#13;
categories.&#13;
4.4    Foreign Exchange Costs.  Foreign exchange costs are estimated at US$43.3 million&#13;
equivalent, representing 42 percent of total project costs and are based on the following percentages:&#13;
(a) international consultants and visiting scholars, overseas training and fellowships, equipment, and&#13;
books and journals - 80 percent; (b) civil works - 30 percent; (c) local consultants and visiting scholars,&#13;
and local training and fellowships - 10 percent; and (e) recurrent costs - 0 percent.&#13;
4.5    Taxes and Duties. Identifiable taxes and duties are estimated at Rp. 9.2 billion (US$4.4&#13;
million equivalent) based on the current 10 percent value added tax on all contracts for goods and&#13;
works.&#13;
B. FINANCING PLAN&#13;
4.6    The total project cost of US$102.1 million equivalent would be financed by a proposed loan of&#13;
US$65.0 million equivalent, covering 67 percent of total project costs excluding taxes (100 percent of&#13;
foreign and 37 percent of local expenditures) as shown in Table 4.2 below. The Government would&#13;
finance from its annual budget the remaining costs of US$37.1 million equivalent including taxes (36&#13;
percent of total project costs including taxes or 33 percent of total project costs excluding taxes).&#13;

4.7    Incremental Recurrent Costs. Incremental recurrent costs are additional costs associated&#13;
with the BHE, the BAN, the Secretariats to the two bodies, and the new or enlarged study programs at&#13;
the target universities, which are expected to continue their functions beyond the project lifetime. It is&#13;
expected that incremental recurrent costs will account for less than 70/o of total investment costs and&#13;
that they will be easily sustainable from the MOEC's budget. All the project-related incremental&#13;
recurrent costs would be financed by the Government in order to ensure sustainability.&#13;
C. PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
4.8     Procurement of goods, services and works under the proposed project would be carried out by&#13;
the Central Project Coordination Unit (CPCU) located within the Directorate General of Higher&#13;
Education (DGHE) and by the individual Local Project Inplementation Units (LPIU) located in the&#13;
target universities. In the CPCU; three experienced staff would be in charge of implementing&#13;
procurement activities. The loan proceeds would be used to finance the Universities Development&#13;
Grants and procurement of works, goods and services under the project. Procurement of works and&#13;

/a Includes selection of Universities Development Grant awardees in accordance with the criteria and procedures agreed with&#13;
the Bank, selection of fellows and their placement following the criteria and procedures agreed with the Bank, selection of&#13;
consultants in accordance with the Bank's guidelines, national shopping for office equipment, and project management&#13;
following the goverunent's administrative procedures acceptable to the Bank. The Universities Development Grants may incur&#13;
procurement of goods through ICB, NCB, shopping, and direct contracting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
(a)   Universities Development Grants (estimated total value: US$70.1 million equivalent,&#13;
including contingencies). The grant proposals submitted by the eligible universities&#13;
have been evaluated by an independent peer panel appointed by the DGHE and the&#13;
selection was made on a competitive basis, in accordance with the procedures and&#13;
selection criteria agreed by the Bank. The format of the draft grant agreements has&#13;
been reviewed and agreed by the Bank. Separate grant agreements would be signed&#13;
between CPCU and the target universities. Each grant agreement would specify that&#13;
the target university shall comply with any applicable procurement guidelines of the&#13;
Bank for the procurement of works, goods and services, and shall at all times exercise&#13;
such responsibility. The grant agreements could cover the financing of civil works,&#13;
management, overseas and domestic fellowships, overseas and domestic visiting&#13;
scholars, equipment, scientific literature and consumables. Each target university&#13;
would be responsible for the procurement of all goods, services and works included in&#13;
its grant agreement with CPCU. To the extent practicable, contracts for equipment&#13;
shall be grouped in bid packages estimated to cost US$250,000 equivalent or more&#13;
each. Target universities would submit procurement plans for goods, services and&#13;
works to be purchased as part of their annual review. These procurement plans would&#13;
be reviewed by the CPCU specialists/panel of experts. The CPCU would provide&#13;
guidance and advice, monitor the procurement activities periodically at target&#13;
universities, and ensure that the agreed procurement procedures are adhered to by the&#13;
target universities. In addition, technical audits (para. 4.13) will be carried out by&#13;
independent experts annually to ensure that the agreed procurement procedures are&#13;
adhered to by the target universities, and the findings of these technical audits will be&#13;
reported to the Bank.&#13;
(b)   Fellowships and Training (estimated total value: US$14.7 million equivalent, including&#13;
contingencies). Fellowships would be awarded to candidates on the basis of individual&#13;
applications as evaluated by CPCU/BHE in accordance with the criteria and&#13;
procedures agreed with the Bank. Training contracts with local training providers&#13;
would be in accordance with Government administrative procedures acceptable&#13;
to the Bank.&#13;
(c)   Office Equipment (computers, copying machines, etc.) for the National Accreditation&#13;
Board, the Board of Higher Education, and Project Coordination Unit (estimated total&#13;
value: US$1.0 million equivalent, including contingencies). Because of the small&#13;
package size in terms of value and quantity, office equipment would be procured&#13;
through National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
National shopping would be used for equipment contracts estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$50,000 per contract up to an aggregate amount of US$300,000 equivalent, with&#13;
quotations from at least three suppliers.&#13;
(d)   Civil Works (estimated  total value: US$0.5  million  equivalent, including&#13;
contingencies). Renovation of BHE and BAN offices would be awarded through NCB&#13;
procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
(e)   Consultants' Services and Studies (estimated total value: US$3.0 million equivalent.&#13;
including contingencies) include auditing and training specialists to assist BHE, BAN,&#13;
and the CPCU in project implementation and development of new paradigm, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
visiting scholars to provide academic expertise to universities and policy studies. The&#13;
consultants would be selected and contracted in accordance with Bank Guidelines for&#13;
Use of Consultants. All consultancy contracts would use the Bank's standard forms of&#13;
contract for consultants.&#13;
(f)    Project Management (estimated total value: US$2.2 million equivalent, including&#13;
contingencies) which includes expenditures by the CPCU for administration costs,&#13;
including honoraria, consumable materials, and travel would be met following&#13;
government administrative procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
4.9    Bank Review. One of the explicit objectives of the project is to help strengthen the capability&#13;
of the Board of Higher Education to select and award educational development and university research&#13;
grants on the basis of agreed criteria and procedures, as well as to develop management capability of&#13;
regional universities. The Bank's prior review requirements are intended to monitor the selection and&#13;
award process, and the adherence to the agreed procedures by the awarded universities, rather than&#13;
review the details of individual activities. Review of procurement activity by the Bank would be&#13;
conducted as follows:&#13;
(a)    All contracts for goods estimated to cost US$250,000 or more per contract, the first&#13;
contract for civil works by each of the target universities, the first contract for civil&#13;
works under Components II and 111, the first contract for goods over US$50,000&#13;
under Components II and m, and Universities Development Grant agreements would&#13;
be subject to prior review. Roughly 80% of the contracts will be subject to prior&#13;
review, including procurement under the Universities Development Grants which will&#13;
be reviewed as part of review and approval process of Grant applications. Other&#13;
contracts will be subject to random post review. The CPCU will closely monitor&#13;
implementation progress under the grant agreements, in particular, universities'&#13;
adherence to the agreed procurement procedures and report to the Bank semi-annually.&#13;
Bank supervision missions and RSI staff will carry out post-review of various&#13;
procurement activities under the project. In addition, technical audits (para 4.13) will&#13;
be undertaken by independent experts, on an annual basis, to ensure, inter alia, that the&#13;
agreed procurement procedures under the Grant agreements are adhered to by the&#13;
target universities; the technical audit reports will be sent to the Bank.&#13;
(b)   All individual consultant contracts costing more than US$50,000 and contracts for&#13;
consulting firms costing more than US$100,000 would be subject to prior review.&#13;
Other consultants' contracts would be subject to random post review. However, all&#13;
terms of reference and single-source selection of consultants would be subject to prior&#13;
review. Other contracts would be subject to random post review.&#13;
(c)    Annual training plans for both overseas and domestic for each year would be furnished&#13;
as part of the annual report for review and discussion with the Bank;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

D. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
4.10   The proposed loan of US$65.0 million equivalent would be disbursed over a period of six&#13;
years (Annex 12). Disbursements are expected to be completed by September 30, 2002, the Loan&#13;
Closing Date. The disbursement schedule is based on the implementation schedule and the&#13;
disbursement profile for education projects in Indonesia. It is somewhat faster than the present profile&#13;
reflecting the readiness of this project and the past implementation experience of DGHE. Agreements&#13;
with six target universities would be for five years. Although the target universities at present lack&#13;
experience in dealing with the Bank, they do have experience in undertaking procurement and other&#13;
aspects of project implementation, and the incentive for them to learn rapidly--the possibility that they&#13;
will lose the grant money to competitor universities if it is not spent according to plan--is very high.&#13;
Disbursements estimated for FY97 are based on the proposed initial deposit into the project Special&#13;
Account and replenishment. Disbursements would be made as shown in Table 4.4.&#13;
Table 4.4: Disbursements&#13;

4.11   Disbursements from the loan proceeds for the following contracts and agreements would be&#13;
made against full documentation: (a) contracts for goods costing more than US$250,000; and (b)&#13;
consultants' services with individual consultants costing more than US$50,000 and consulting firm&#13;
contracts costing more than US$100,000. All other disbursements would be made against statements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
of expenditures (SOE) for which relevant documents would be retained by responsible agencies and&#13;
made available for review as requested by visiting Bank missions. To facilitate disbursements, a&#13;
Special Account in an amount up to US$5.0 million would be established at the Bank Indonesia or a&#13;
state commercial bank, to be used by DGHE under the direction of the Director General of the Budget,&#13;
Ministry of Finance, following established procedures. The proposed Special Account would be used&#13;
for all foreign and local expenditures. Replenishment to the Special Account would be made on a&#13;
monthly basis or whenever the outstanding balance is less than 80 percent of the initial deposit,&#13;
whichever comes first.&#13;
E. ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS&#13;
4.12  DGHE will establish separate project accounts for all project expenditures to be maintained in&#13;
accordance with sound accounting practices. Accounts and documentation supporting the Statement of&#13;
Expenditures and Special Account are to be maintained separately by DG Budget, MOF. The CPCU&#13;
will prepare a consolidated financial statement covering all project expenditures. The financial&#13;
statement will be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit report will contain&#13;
a separate opinion by the auditors on the statement of expenditures used as a basis for disbursement.&#13;
Certified copies of the financial statement on the project for each Government fiscal year, together with&#13;
the auditors' statement, will be furnished to the Bank as soon as available, but not later than six months&#13;
after the end of each fiscal year. During negotiations, the Government provided an assurance that the&#13;
project accounts, including the special account and SOEs, will be audited annually by independent&#13;
auditors satisfactory to the Bank and audit reports are to be furnished to the Bank within six months of&#13;
the end of the Government's fiscal year.&#13;
4.13  Technical Audits. To ensure accountability to the Government, the Bank, the academic&#13;
community, and the general public, a technical audit (Annex 13) of the various project&#13;
components will be carried out annually, in a manner acceptable to the Bank, and the technical&#13;
audit report will be furnished to the Bank not later than June 30 of each year. The technical&#13;
audit will be carried out by an independent consultant with no association with the project and&#13;
possessing specialists with expertise in (i) management and award of development grant programs; (ii)&#13;
university administration and finance; (iii) university accreditation; and (iv) graduate fellowship&#13;
programs. The goal of the technical audit is to provide an independent and impartial assessment of the&#13;
quality and adequacy of procedures and processes employed by the BHE and the BAN Secretariats and&#13;
the six target universities under the proposed project. For the BIHE, the audit team will examine the&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness with which the BIHE selected awardees, made awards, and monitored and&#13;
evaluated the implementation of the university grants under the project. In addition, the audit team will&#13;
examine whether BHE's personnel are performring as reported and whether equipment and facilities&#13;
available for the BHE Secretariat operations are adequate, as well as being used as reported. For the&#13;
BAN, the audit team will examine (I) the development of accreditation practices and procedures and&#13;
(ii) the timelines of the accreditation of selected academic fields and institutions. For the individual&#13;
universities, the technical audit will include a sample check of documentation for award as well as&#13;
selected site visits (about two per year) to check physical reality against the most recent report&#13;
submitted to the BEE Secretariat and compliance with accounting, procurement, and reporting&#13;
guidelines. The technical audit for the Domestic Fellowship component will include a sample check of&#13;
the selection process and the progress made by the selected candidates.&#13;

5. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
5.1   The benefits from the project-supported phased implementation of the New Paradigm are&#13;
expected to be substantial. At the institutional level, the project is expected to have an economic rate of&#13;
return of 24% (para 3.16), arising from improvements at the six selected target universities in (a)&#13;
education quality, resulting in increased earnings for graduates, (b) the efficiency of teaching/learning&#13;
processes, resulting in a reduction in the time students take to graduate, and (c) the relevance of study&#13;
programs and curricula, resulting in a reduction in the time graduates must wait until they obtain&#13;
employment. Mean job search time is expected to decrease as individual institutions of higher&#13;
education foster relationships with local businesses and industries to improve the relevance of their&#13;
offerings, and as they restructure themselves to supply graduates in fields demanded by local&#13;
stakeholders. The project is therefore expected to contribute to regional development in the areas&#13;
surrounding the six target universities. Expected benefits of the sector-wide components include (d)&#13;
improved education qualitv throughout the higher-education system, as institutions respond to the&#13;
evaluation and accreditation process, as they undertake self-evaluation and compete for funds and&#13;
teaching staff, and as they have access to a larger pool of better-qualified teaching staff, (e) improved&#13;
efficiency as institutions acquire the responsibility and accountability for their use of resources and&#13;
therefore undertake evaluation and planning designed to improve their efficiency, and (f) increased&#13;
relevance, as the center increasingly focuses scarce resources on highest-priority needs and programs.&#13;
By raising the quality of university graduates, the project as a whole is expected to help Indonesia&#13;
compete in the international marketplace.&#13;
B. RISKS&#13;
5.2   Five risks have been identified in this project. A first risk is that the central Government may&#13;
be unwilling to implement the New Paradigm fully, i.e., it may be unwilling to devolve resources and&#13;
the responsibility for planning and implementation to the university level. This risk is considered&#13;
minimal, since during project preparation, substantial progress was made in building ownership of the&#13;
New Paradigm, both at the level of the central Government and at the level of the stakeholders. A&#13;
second risk is that funds made available from other sources would subvert the competitive allocation&#13;
mechanism introduced in this project. This risk would be mitigated because the BHE is committed to&#13;
the New Paradigm and will closely monitor. future funding decisions. A third risk is that the&#13;
accreditation process may be too ambitious for the newly established BAN to carry out in a meaningful&#13;
way, such that the results will be discredited. This risk will be minimized through careful planning and&#13;
a phasing in of the accreditation process as capacity is developed to carry out critical evaluations. A&#13;
fourth risk is that bottom-up planning, where individual universities determine what courses and&#13;
programs of study they will offer, may be incompatible with national requirements. This risk is also&#13;
considered to be minimal, since it is expected that universities will become progressively more&#13;
sophisticated in reading market signals and in determining their course offerings accordingly. A fifth&#13;
risk is that the six selected universities will not be able to implement their proposals adequately, since&#13;
they will be responsible for tasks which heretofore have been the responsibility of the center. This risk&#13;
would be mitigated through the provision by the Central Project Coordinating Unit of timely training&#13;
and technical assistance in all the various aspects of implementation, including procurement,&#13;
accounting, monitoring, and reporting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
5.3   Simulations presented in Annex 6 provide some indication of how failure to achieve the&#13;
performance targets would affect the estimated economic rate of return. Delaying all benefits by three&#13;
years would result in an economic rate of return of 14 percent. Achieving all other targets, while&#13;
making no progress in reducing the waiting time to employment, would result in an economic rate of&#13;
return of 20 percent. Achieving all targets but the reduction in time to graduate would result in an&#13;
economic rate of return of 21 percent.&#13;
C. SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
5.4   Financial Sustainability. At the level of individual institutions, the project introduces a new&#13;
measure to improve sustainability of investment inputs through the requirement that universities&#13;
develop their own investment proposals based on their institutional development plans and their ability&#13;
to sustain the proposed investments from their own self-generated resources. The guidelines used by&#13;
the six target universities in the preparation of their proposals explicitly limited the total amount that&#13;
could be requested by each individual university, based on that university's projections of self-&#13;
generated income (the budget on which the sustainability of the investment will depend). The project is&#13;
therefore expected to be sustainable, in terms of each target university's ability to sustain the&#13;
investment made. At the sector level, as the New Paradigm is phased in, all institutions of higher&#13;
education in Indonesia wilH be required to compete for resources--and to suffer the consequences of&#13;
bad planning. This should result in more realistic planning which is more likely to be sustained in the&#13;
long run.&#13;
5.5   Institutional Sustainabilitv. In terms of institutional sustainability, commitment to the New&#13;
Paradigm is evident among all stakeholders. Decision-makers at the center have already begun to&#13;
promulgate the legal framework for the New Paradigm and are moving towards a more rational&#13;
system for allocating resources. If for any reason the commitment among these decision-makers at the&#13;
center to moving towards a more decentralized system were to wane, the sheer size and complexity of&#13;
Indonesia's higher-education system would force continued movement in the direction of&#13;
decentralization. At the university level, the ten universities invited to undertake self-evaluation and&#13;
prepare proposals expressed enormous enthusiasm about the process and  believed that their&#13;
educational mandate was far more likely to be achieved successfully in the future, since they were now&#13;
involved in planning that mandate.&#13;
D. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
5.6   The proposed has an environmental rating of 'C'" no project activity is expected to have&#13;
adverse effects on the environment. There is potential for positive effects on environmental education&#13;
and research through improved scientific capacities in the selected universities and through the linkages&#13;
of study program development to regional and national needs related to economically sustainable.&#13;
E. IMPACT ON WOMEN&#13;
5.7   In 1992, women constituted 36% of undergraduates and 46% of diploma-program students,&#13;
with increasing proportions of women among the new intake every year. Research on gender has&#13;
shown that women face difficulties in attending universities far from their homes and families and that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
there are higher forgone costs associated with educating females. This project will provide quality&#13;
higher education close to home and with greater efficiency, thereby reducing these constraints.&#13;
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
6.1   During negotiations, assurances were obtained that (a) the Governnent will provide grants to&#13;
target universities in accordance with procedures and on conditions agreed with the Bank (para. 3.3),&#13;
(b) the Governnent will implement the Universities Development component according to the&#13;
implementation plan furnished the Bank (para 3.4), (c) the grant agreements between the target&#13;
universities and the CPCU will include a requirement that the BHE prepare and monitor baseline and&#13;
target indicators and recommend to DGHE any ameliorative actions (paras. 3.4 and 3.6), (d) the&#13;
Government will maintain the BiE and its Secretariat in accordance with terms of reference, staffing,&#13;
and resources acceptable to the Bank (para. 3.6), (e) the Government will implement the BAN&#13;

Higher Education Support Project: Development of Undergraduate Education&#13;
Identification and Selection of Less Established Universities&#13;
Over half of Indonesia's universities can be considered less established lacking both&#13;
focus and academic tradition. The Government of Indonesia believes that the necessity to&#13;
provide assistance to those less established universities has become urgent. To identify the&#13;
17 possible target institutions, the DGHE began with the existing 51 public universities and&#13;
excluded the following:&#13;
* the seven (7) universities and three IKIPs with large and established graduate programs&#13;
* the nine (9) IKIPs and STKIPs&#13;
* the nine (9) less established universities receiving sizable investments from other sources&#13;
* the five (5) art universities&#13;
* the one (1) open university&#13;
The universities listed below were the 17 eligible for participation in the DUE project:&#13;
Universitas Jambi, Universitas Bengkulu, Universitas Riau, Universitas Lampung,&#13;
Universitas Pattimura, Universitas Nusa Cendana, Universitas Cendrawasih, Universitas&#13;
Haluoleo, Universitas Tadulako, Universitas Lambung Mangkurat, Universitas&#13;
Palangkaraya, Universitas Mataram, Universitas Tanjungpura, Universitas Sam Ratulangi,&#13;
Universitas Jember, Universitas Jenderal Soedirman, and Universitas Sebelas Maret&#13;
The following criteria will be used in awarding grants to universities:&#13;
I. Leadership and institutional commitment&#13;
2. Efficiency and productivity&#13;
3. Relevance to local and national labor market needs.&#13;
4. Internal management and organization&#13;
5. Academic atmosphere&#13;
6. Sustainability of investments through the DRK upon project completion.&#13;
Participatory Process&#13;
To encourage participation at an early stage in the process, representatives from each of&#13;
the 17 universities were invited to participate in one of three workshops. Three day&#13;
workshops were held in Pekanbaru, Ambon, and Mataram in order to disseminate&#13;
information about the New Paradigm, to seek feedback on the New Paradigm from the&#13;
universities, and to provide guidance to the universities on the process of self evaluation that&#13;
they would carry out. Each university was represented either by the Rector or Vice Rector.&#13;
The workshops were facilitated by the Director for Academic Affairs of the DGHE and the&#13;
five World Bank Mission members.&#13;
In addition, sessions were also conducted with students in order to allow them to express&#13;
their concerns regarding their education. Students were generally open and articulate in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-43-                          Annex 3&#13;
Page 2 of 16&#13;
expressing their concerns over the lack of transparency in university management and the&#13;
lack of a reliable and secure mechanism to communicate with university management. It was&#13;
also discerned during these sessions that the Student Senate, which should provide an avenue&#13;
of communication between the students and the administration, does not serve this function.&#13;
Separate sessions were held with employers to obtain their assessment of the quality and&#13;
relevance of the current study programs and to solicit their ideas for strengthening the&#13;
linkages between higher education and the productive sectors.&#13;
Pre-proposal Preparation&#13;
As part of the pre-proposal process, each university was asked to prepare a self&#13;
evaluation upon which their pre-proposals and full proposals for funding would be based.&#13;
Self evaluations were asked to contain a description of existing available resources,&#13;
including academic staff, administrative staff, laboratory facilities (including major&#13;
equipment), class room space, teacher and administrative space, library facilities, land,&#13;
experimental fields, if any, student enrollment, and other relevant resources. The description&#13;
should indicate resources which have been acquired over the last 5 years, and sources of&#13;
funding. It is important that universities demonstrate the ability to recognize institutional&#13;
deficiencies in their self evaluations and to indicate actions taken to remedy them. In&#13;
addition, pre-proposals should contain the following information':&#13;
* Leadership and institutional commitment&#13;
* Efficiency and productivity&#13;
* Relevance to local and national labor market needs.&#13;
* Utilization of class rooms and laboratories&#13;
* Number of library transactions&#13;
* Internal management and organization&#13;
* Current budget, including the DRK, for the last three years&#13;
* Budget allocation mechanism&#13;
* Revenue generated from alternative sources&#13;
* Efforts to improve transparency in management.&#13;
* Efforts at Reducing bureaucracy&#13;
* Maintenance of equipment and physical facilities&#13;
* Sustainability of investments through the DRK upon project completion.&#13;
* Ratio between administrative and academic building space&#13;
* Academic atmosphere&#13;
*  Staff profile and teaching load&#13;
* Teacher attendance&#13;
* Student-staff ratio by study program&#13;
* Resource sharing among faculties, departments, and programs&#13;
* Introduction of staff evaluation by students and peers&#13;
* Production of student laboratory manuals&#13;
* Staff development&#13;
* Recruitment mechanism of new teaching staff.&#13;
The Annex contains a list of pre-proposal and proposal components. A more detailed explanation of&#13;
these components can be found in the Project Proposal Document in the divisional project files.&#13;

University of Lampung (UNILA)&#13;
Year Established: 1965&#13;
Location: Bandar Lampung&#13;
Programs Offered: Seven colleges: Economics, Law, Education and Teachers Training, Agriculture,&#13;
Engineering, Social and Political Sciences, and Mathematics and Natural Sciences. UNILA offers 27&#13;
programs and three non-degree programs.&#13;
Staff Profile: Although the university recruits teaching staff from the outside market (no in-breeding),&#13;
staff qualifications are poor, with most staff holding S-1 degrees, low teaching experience (mainly because&#13;
of the young age of most staff), low competency and low specialization.&#13;
Physical Facilities: The university has sufficient space to and a resource sharing mechanism has been&#13;
introduced in 1992 to use facilities and resources more efficiently. Laboratory facilities are inadequate.&#13;
Existing facilities lack proper maintenance.&#13;
Teaching Materials: There is a lack of laboratory manuals, lack of teaching aids and limited electricity&#13;
and water supply. There is also a lack of capable technicians to operate and repair teaching aids.&#13;
Student Profile: Quality of incoming students is not good. Average duration of study is of 5.6 years&#13;
(1985-89) and that of the skripsi ranges from 7 to 14 months (against an appropriate time of 6 months).&#13;
Average score of students admitted to various programs in 1995 is between 473 (Civic Education) and 652&#13;
(Accounting).&#13;
Employability of Graduates: At present the waiting time for graduates to get their first job is 2-3 years.&#13;
In order to shorten this time span, a Job Placement Center has been recently set up with the assistance from&#13;
USAID. Average graduate GPA is below 2.5, which is too low even  for employment with the public&#13;
sector.&#13;
Plan for Self-Improvement: Includes improvements in relevance, improvements in the academic&#13;
atmosphere, improvements in internal management and organization, improving sustainability, efficiency&#13;
and productivity.&#13;
How to Achieve Improvements: Add flexibility to the curriculum and development of the language&#13;
laboratory and laboratory of engineering and basic sciences, increase involvement of staff in planning for.&#13;
academic activities, review and improve academic regulations, increase involvement of individual&#13;
departments in planning and budgeting, improve access to wider sources of funding and enable laboratories&#13;
to become self-funded by extending scope for cooperation with the private sector, improve the capacity of&#13;
administrative staff, improve teachers attendance and encourage students counseling activities&#13;
Performance Indicators: Relevance: Target is to shorten waiting time to get first job; Academic&#13;
Atmosphere: Target is to increase average score of graduate GPA and increase staff teaching load; Internal&#13;
Management: more transparency in management and shorter time of bureaucratic processes; Sustainability:&#13;
access wider sources of funding, strengthen autonomy and improve staff career development; Efficiency:&#13;
Increase productivity ratio and increase efficiency of facilities utilization.&#13;
Amount Requested: A total of Rps. 17,188,177 million is requested under the proposed project.&#13;
Project Sustainability: 10% of DRK is committed.&#13;

University of Bengkulu (UNIB)&#13;
Year Established: 1982&#13;
Location: Bengkulu, Bengkulu Province&#13;
Programs Offered: The university has five faculties: Agriculture, Economics, Law, Political and Social&#13;
Sciences, and Teacher Training and Education Sciences, and offers 14 programs.&#13;
Staff Profile: The number of teaching staff in academic year 1995/96 is 459 as opposed to 444 in 1991/92.&#13;
While the number of academic staff has increased only slightly over the last five years, staff qualifications&#13;
have improved, with the number of staff with S-2 and S-3 degrees increasing from only 22.4% in 1991/92&#13;
to 57.8% in 1995/96. The Faculty of Agriculture has the highest number of staff holding S-3 degrees and&#13;
Currently, 58% of academic staff holds S-2 and S-3 degrees. Academic staff lacks research and extension&#13;
experience. Academic staff load is on average more than 12 FTE, and it is highest for staff holding S-3&#13;
degrees. Overall, teachers attendance is less than standard (90%). The university also has a total of 300&#13;
administrative staff. The supply of laboratory technicians is inadequate, with every technician serving&#13;
approximately 30 students. The ratio of academic staff to students is relatively high at 1;7, but differs&#13;
greatly among faculties and programs. Recruitment of academic staff is done at the national level through a&#13;
competitive process. The competitiveness of the social programs is generally higher than for natural&#13;
science programs, with an applicant/admitted ratio of about 0.12 and 0.20, respectively.&#13;
Physical Facilities: The university allocates 5 buildings for classrooms (3924 sq.m.), and accommodate&#13;
2950 students.  Currently, an additional 3500 sq. m. are under construction, and are expected to&#13;
accommodate an additional 2950 students. However, classroom utilization is not optimal. Utilization of&#13;
laboratories is high, due to the fact that laboratory equipment is uneavenly distributed. Although there is no&#13;
data on space ratio between academic and administrative space, this is obviously not appropriately&#13;
distributed as most academic staff do not have offices. Efforts to date to build office space for academic&#13;
staff have been constrained by unavailability of funds. The library building is large, but lacks adequate&#13;
library material.&#13;
Teaching Materials: Classrooms lack adequate teaching aids. The record system in the library is&#13;
incomplete and limited to the number of visitors and number of transactions. Laboratory equipment is&#13;
obsolete or lacking. In agronomy and basic sciences programs, student laboratory manuals are either not&#13;
available, or typed rather than published. Only relatively simple equipment can be properly maintained by&#13;
the university.&#13;
Student Profile: Number of applicants has remained relatively constant over the last few years. Most of&#13;
incoming students, especially in the Faculty of Agriculture, has low capabilities in basic sciences. Up to&#13;
January 1995, UNIB produced 2,831 S- I graduates. Overall average duration of skripsi is of more than 5.5&#13;
years, far above the length of study in the curriculum which is of 4 years. In certain faculties the duration&#13;
of studies is even higher i.e. 49.93% of students in the faculty of agriculture needs 6 or more years to&#13;
graduate. This is mainly due to the length of time involved in preparing the skripsi, as well as to the&#13;
inadequacy of teaching staff in the early years of study and the weakness of academic advisers. In order to&#13;
shorten the duration of studies, a new curriculum with less SKS (but still within the national standard) has&#13;
been recently introduced.Overall, average GPA of graduating students has been around 2.50.&#13;
Employability of Graduates: There is no data on employability of graduates. However, indications are&#13;
that local public and private sector requires graduates with at least a 2.75 GPA. Personal communication&#13;
with students has indicated that waiting time has been around 2 to 3 years.&#13;

Page 11 of 16&#13;
Plan for Self-Improvement: Improve relevance; improve academic atmosphere; improve internal&#13;
management and organization; improve sustainability; increase efficiency and productivity&#13;
How to Achieve Improvements: By revising curriculum in each study program and introducing&#13;
internships for students; improving library collections, providing students with counseling; stimulating&#13;
students to improve English proficiency by expanding English Center and its facilities; centralizing class&#13;
schedules at the university level, and conducting periodic evaluations at all levels and units within the&#13;
university; encouraging income generating activities by establishing a Small Business Development Center&#13;
providing consulting and research services; increasing student body and improving supporting facilities.&#13;
Performance Indicators: Increase percentage of teaching staff with S-2 and S-3 degrees to 80% over the&#13;
next few years; Distribute teaching load more equally among teaching staff; shorten average duration of&#13;
study to 4.5-5.0 years; increase number of transactions in library; accelerate graduation time and reduce&#13;
drop-out rate by offering tutorials; increase graduates' GPA from 2.50 to 2.75; shorten waiting time to&#13;
obtain first job from 2-3 years to I year.&#13;
Amount Requested: Total investment budget is of US$5,818,936.35.&#13;
Project Sustainability: Of the amount required for the investment, the University will fund USS 344,005&#13;
out of its DRK ( 5.91 %).&#13;
University of Nusa Cendana (UNDANA)&#13;
Year Established: 1962&#13;
Location: Kupang&#13;
Programs Offered: Five faculties: Animal Husbandry, Agriculture, Administration Science; Teacher&#13;
Training and Education; Law.&#13;
Staff Profile: The university has 677 academic staff and 711 administrative staff. The ratio between staff&#13;
holding S-1: S-2 : S-3 degrees is 39: 9: 1. 50% of staff holding doctorates is in the Faculty of Animal&#13;
Husbandry. Academic and administrative staff have to serve 6263 students enrolled in 26 programs.&#13;
Average teaching load of staff is of 3.05 credit hours per semester. The teaching load of staff with a&#13;
doctorate degree is of 5.0 credit hours per semester. The heaviest teaching load is carried out by Basic&#13;
Science staff. Teacher attendance ratio is of approximately 87.5%. Student-staff ratio varies across&#13;
faculties, but is particularly poor in the Physics Study Program ,as most staff are currently away attending&#13;
higher degrees.&#13;
Physical Facilities: The space occupied by administrative staff is twice as much as the space being used&#13;
for academic purposes. This is exhibited by the building space ratio between administrative and academic&#13;
of 4. 19/sq.m./person: 2.38 /sq.m./person. Some classrooms are in need of renovation. Although overall the&#13;
university has enough rooms to serve student needs both academically and administratively, the available&#13;
space has not been optimally utilized, especially as concerns academic purposes. The university is unable&#13;
to provide for proper maintenance of existing physical facilities because of limited resources. On average,&#13;
administrative facilities are better maintained than teaching facilities. Most laboratories are faced with&#13;
problems such as lack water and unstable electricity.&#13;
Teaching Materials: Equipment for student practices is insufficient, especially during the first year. All&#13;
laboratories except for the Chemistry laboratory are assisted by unskilled technicians.&#13;
&#13;

Student Profile: According to the UMPTN test criteria, students coming from NTF province are of&#13;
moderate quality with respect to those coming from other 26 provinces. Of these, the least able choose to&#13;
continue studies in NTT province and constitute the pool of applicants to UNDANA. Data on duration of&#13;
skripti is only available for the Faculties of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry (about 2 semesters).&#13;
Students spend on average more than 6 years to complete their studies.&#13;
Employability of Graduates: Waiting time for students to obtain the first job is between 6 to 30 months.&#13;
The shortest waiting time (6 months) has been registered for students in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry,&#13;
and English. The longest waiting time has been registered for graduates in Social Sciences.&#13;
Plan for Self-Improvement: The program proposes to assist four programs: Agronomy, Animal&#13;
Production, Basic Science, and English Language Education. Selection of the four programs is aimed at;&#13;
improving quality of the programs, increase their relevance, enhance knowledge and skills of academic&#13;
staff, increase employability rate of graduates; and strive to offer more practical courses.&#13;
How to Achieve Improvements: Improve students input through matriculation, improve teaching and&#13;
learning process through provision of more practical learning experience such as practicum, tutorial, site&#13;
visits, class exercises, and assigning senior and qualified staff for teaching the first year students; improve&#13;
relevance of S-l education by designing local curriculum which accommodates the needs of local&#13;
communities; improve staff qualifications through S-2 and S-3 degree training, or training programs, both&#13;
overseas and domestic; optimize use of laboratories and classrooms, through reallocation and sharing of&#13;
resources; implement bottom-up planning in management and increase transparency; provide recognition&#13;
to students and provide incentives to staff with extra teaching load, provide staff with teaching grants&#13;
allocated on a competitive basis; generate income through marketing of staff expertise, university facilities&#13;
such as laboratories and buildings for external use.&#13;
Performance Indicators: Increased frequency of teaching staff attendance at respective department;&#13;
increase in frequency and quality of academic interaction and communication between teaching staff and&#13;
students; increase in GPA; reduce length of thesis writing; reduce length of study; increase in teaching staff&#13;
productivity; reduce administrative/academic staff ratio.&#13;
Amount Requested: A total of USS 6,007,598 is requested over five years.&#13;
Project Sustainability: The university has committed US$ 410,295, equal to 10% of the DRK over five&#13;
years.&#13;
University of Riau (UNU)&#13;
Year Established: 1962&#13;
Location: Pekanbaru&#13;
Programs Offered: Seven faculties: Fisheries, Agriculture, Engineering, Mathematics and Natural&#13;
Sciences, Social Sciences and Politics, Economics and Teachers Training and Education.&#13;
Staff Profile: Data on staff with advanced degree is not available. However, the overall percentage of staff&#13;
holding S-2 and S-3 degrees is low. Recruitment mechanism for staff is not transparent. Student-teacher&#13;
ratio is low in most faculties, in the order of '12:1. Most lecturers have high teaching loads and limited&#13;
teaching preparation. Most teaching staff and students lack English proficiency. Academic staff research is&#13;
often unrelated to local needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-54-                                    Annex 3&#13;
Page 13 of 16&#13;
Physical Facilities: Utilization of classroom is generally low. Laboratory space is limited or unavailable.&#13;
Teaching Materials: There is a lack of manuals for practice and laboratory exercises. Teaching aids are&#13;
limited and reproduction of teaching materials would greatly enhance the teaching-learning process. The&#13;
University library is not used effectively. Data on number of transactions is lacking. The library does not&#13;
have adequate and relevant collection in most of the scientific subject matters. Some of the faculties (i.e.&#13;
Agribusiness) have therefore established their own libraries, which have a slightly better collection than the&#13;
university library.&#13;
Student Profile: Quality of incoming students is generally low in all faculties and study programs,&#13;
although it is difficult to measure it in quantitative terms. Competitiveness among students through national&#13;
entrance examination is ]ow. Student drop-out rate is also high, but difficult to monitor because&#13;
administrative management, especially at registration, is not good. Graduate GPA is low. It varies across&#13;
faculties, but generally within the range of 2.2 - 2.5.&#13;
Employability of Graduates: Average time required for graduates to obtain their first job varies across&#13;
faculties, but it is overage of 2.0-2.5 years. There is a marked lack of information among students of the&#13;
job market.&#13;
Plan for Self-Improvement:  The scope of the proposed development program covers eleven study&#13;
programs-based activities and two university  wide activities as follows: Agribusiness (Faculty of&#13;
Agriculture); Chemistry (Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences); Physics (Faculty of Mathematics&#13;
and Natural Sciences); Mathematics (Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences); Aquaculture (Faculty&#13;
of Fisheries); Aquatic Resources Management (Faculty of Fisheries); Marine Sciences (Faculty of&#13;
Fisheries); Accounting (Faculty of Economics); Management (Faculty of Economics); Economic&#13;
Development (Faculty of Economics); English Education (Faculty of Teacher Training and Education);&#13;
Computer Center (University wide activities); Career and Entrepreneurship Development Center&#13;
(University wide activities). All activities proposed are aimed at increasing efficiency and productivity. In&#13;
particular, the actives could be classified in the following categories: improving human resource quality;&#13;
providing more adequate facilities;  providing teaching materials; improving academic atmosphere,&#13;
increasing relevance of the curriculum; and improving the internal and external management system.&#13;
How to Achieve Improvements: Staff from the selected study-programs will be sent for further training&#13;
both in-country and abroad. Training will include both degree (Masters and Ph.D. level) and non-degree&#13;
(short courses and study visits). In view of the limitations of equipment which UNRI has been facing since&#13;
1962, and in view of the importance of adequate equipment for improving quality and effectiveness of&#13;
education, the university proposes investments in laboratory and field equipment. In terms of civil works,&#13;
these will mainly comprise renovations of existing facilities. Some technical assistance will be required&#13;
during and after implementation of the investment. The assistance will be invited from overseas and&#13;
domestic experts. The proposal also includes provision of updated reading material and additional titles for&#13;
the library. The provision of research grants is also included for each study program, as a way to reduce the&#13;
duration of study for S- I students and to increase supervision of research projects for students skripsi.&#13;
Performance Indicators: Improvements in the curriculum to increase employability of graduates and&#13;
reduce waiting time (i.e. some faculties have set up Task Forces in charge of reviewing the curriculum i.e.&#13;
Agribusiness). Increase linkages with local industry through seminars and workshops. Improvements in the&#13;
quality of skripsi and in docent research. Enhanced relevance of research to local needs. Introduction of&#13;
more transparent management by increasing managerial skills and making budget allocation processes&#13;
clearer. Reduction in bureaucracy through rationalization of administrative processes and introduction of&#13;
bottom-up management.&#13;
Amount Requested: The total amount of the proposed investment is fUS$10,182,042.&#13;

Project Sustainability: About 10% of five years UNRI's DRK will be allocated to support the&#13;
implementation of the project for a total amount of US$1,008,000.&#13;
Sebelas Maret University (aNS&#13;
Year Established: 1976&#13;
Location: Kenthingan (Surakarta)&#13;
Programs Offered:  The university has 8 faculties: Arts and Letters, Teacher Training and Education,&#13;
Law, Economics, Social and Political Sciences, Medicine, Agriculture, and Engineering. In addition, the&#13;
university comprises a main office, a laboratory center and a language center.&#13;
Staff Profile: The university has 1338 academic staff, of which 976 (72.9%) have S-l degrees, 329&#13;
(24.5%) are S-2 graduates, and 33 (2,5%) are S-3 graduates. At present, 226 of the 1338 academic staff are&#13;
working on their graduate degrees in a variety of universities, including domestic S-2 (167), overseas S2&#13;
(22), domestic S3 (34), and overseas S# (3). New teaching staff are recruited on the basis of GPA&#13;
(minimum 2.5 to 3.0), and achievements in performance and selection tests. In 1993, there were 17&#13;
vacancies with 157 applicants; in 1994 there were 12 vacancies with 36 applicants; and in 1995, there were&#13;
241 applicants for only 26 vacancies. Vacancies for teaching staff are publicly advertised and decisions on&#13;
selection are made in an open university top managers meeting. Main negative points in terms of staff&#13;
development is that none of the faculties or study programs have specified programs for returnees. Main&#13;
problem is that academic staff are not proportionately distributed .The overall student-staff ratio is of 1: 1 1.&#13;
In addition, faculties for which there is a high demand for graduates, such as Economics and Engineering,&#13;
lack senior and better qualified staff. There are currently 792 administrative staff. Average graduate GPA&#13;
varies across faculties. Although overall average GPA is improving, there are still a few study programs&#13;
where graduates have low GPAs (i.e. Faculty of Medicine, where average GPA over the last three years&#13;
was 2.3, 2.5 and 2.4 respectively).&#13;
Physical Facilities: The university has a large area of land, about 926.342 sq.m. The big problem is that&#13;
the land is not in one location, but spread in different locations throughout Surakarta. The ratio of&#13;
administrative and academic space is respectively I ;2.5. More academic space is badly needed. Of the 193&#13;
classrooms available, 39% have a capacity between 40 and 60 students, 20% are smaller classrooms for&#13;
less than 30 students, and the rest are larger classrooms for more than 60 students. To improve quality,&#13;
small group instruction needs to be encouraged. One positive aspect in the utilization of classrooms is that&#13;
sharing among many study programs is highly common. Almost each study program has at least one&#13;
laboratory. The intensity of laboratory utilization varies from one lab to another. In addition to its own&#13;
library, each faculty has its own library. Students and books ratio is 1:9 respectively. The average number&#13;
of transactions each month in all libraries is 14,000, compared to a number of 18,092 students, denoting the&#13;
need to assist the library and improve its utilization by both students and teaching staff.&#13;
Teaching Materials:  Although the library has a large collection, it mostly consists of BPK written by&#13;
UNS teachers. Recent books on particular fields, such as science and technology, are scarce and the library&#13;
needs more communication media and scientific journals. Provision of advanced equipment is also needed&#13;
for the laboratory center. Training is also needed in the use of more advanced equipment and technology,&#13;
particularly for students in the Engineering Faculty.&#13;
Student Profile: There are currently 18,092 students enrolled in the university, of which 14,816 are&#13;
regular degree students, 1197 are non-degree students, and 2,079 extension students. Quality of students is&#13;
good, and students admitted are among the top in the nation. In terms of average scores obtained by&#13;
applicants admitted, the university is ranked number 7 in the nation for science faculties (avg. score of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

668.85), number 4 for science education (avg. score 559.33), number 6 for non science faculties, and&#13;
number 2 for non-science education. Number of drop-out students is getting lower. In the Faculty of&#13;
Medicine the drop-out rate is the highest at about 6% per year&gt; In other faculties, students drop-outs are&#13;
relatively low at about 1% to 3%.&#13;
Employability of Graduates: Waiting time for graduates to get their first job varies from I year (English,&#13;
Science and Math) to five years (other study programs). Waiting time for graduates from the Faculty of&#13;
Economics, General Medicine, Agriculture and Engineering is the lowest from 3 to 12 months.&#13;
Plan for self-improvement: UNS proposal request assistance for programs at basically two different&#13;
scopes: program -wide and university-wide areas. The selected programs are: the Engineering Program, at&#13;
the Faculty of Engineering, serving students at all the departments of the faculty, except those at the&#13;
Mathematics Program; the Basic Science Program, at the Central Laboratory with its sub-laboratories,&#13;
serving students learning Chemistry, Biology, Physics and the Agriculture, Engineering, Medicine, and the&#13;
Teacher Training and Education Facilities; and the Entrepreneurship Program, at the Faculty of Economics.&#13;
University-wide programs will include assistance for: the library program, the language program, the&#13;
computer progran and the administration program, all of which are serving the S-I students and the entire&#13;
faculties. The programs to be assisted under the proposed program, the Engineering and Basic Science&#13;
Programs especially, have been selected in view of their importance to national development and&#13;
Government's policy to increase output and quality of graduates in engineering and other scientific fields.&#13;
How to Achieve Improvements: Engineering Program: activities will include increase in relevance of the&#13;
curriculum and procurement of recent books and publications; improvements in the quality of academic&#13;
staff through post-graduate studies, technical assistance and visiting experts; improvements in staff and&#13;
students' ability in the use of high technology and improvements in the management system for the&#13;
teaching-learning process. Basic Sciences Program: activities will include: procurement of equipment in&#13;
quality, quantity and in variation, development of staff qualifications through both post-graduate education&#13;
and non-degree training; increase in practical sessions, improvement in the coordination between the Basic&#13;
Sciences Laboratories and the other units at UNS; improve efficiency by providing students with the&#13;
opportunity to perform practical work in the laboratories. Entrepreneurship Program: activities will&#13;
include: support for laboratories in entrepreneurship training and departmental on-the-job training;&#13;
improvements in the quality of education; and improvements in educational input factors through staff&#13;
training, teaching-leaming activities, construction of outdoors laboratories, and procurement of updated&#13;
reference materials, ; provision of intensive assistance for final assignment and skripsi writing. Assistance&#13;
to university-wide program swill include: improvements in the library collection and in the quality of&#13;
library services; provision of means and facilities for improving undergraduate students' proficiency in&#13;
English; provision of greater opportunities fro students to join computer courses and coordination of the&#13;
implementation of computer courses with facilities; and the development of a computerized administration&#13;
system for UNS administrative services..&#13;
Performance Indicators:  Increased relevance will be measured through improvements in the quality,&#13;
quantity and variation of updated equipment and teaching manuals and by increased opportunities for&#13;
students to participate in activities which are relevant to the job market; improvements in academic&#13;
atmosphere will be measured by improvements in teachers' attendance, increases in academic staff&#13;
qualifications, increased academic activities such as seminars and workshops, and stronger collaborations&#13;
with other institutions both in-country and abroad; increased efficiency and productivity will be measured&#13;
by increases in students intake, reduced drop-out rates, increased GPA for students and increased in&#13;
employability of graduates with shortest time-wait. Finally, increased sustainability will be measured by&#13;
increased DRK funds to match investment budget, and wider participation of individuals and units in UNS&#13;
in the designing and implementation of activities.&#13;

Higher Education Support Project: Development of Undergraduate Education&#13;
The Board of Higher Education&#13;
The Government plans to strengthen institutional capacity both at the center and at&#13;
individual universities. At the central level, the Government is in the process of establishing&#13;
a new Board of Higher Education (BHE), to be supported by a permanent Secretariat. The&#13;
BHE will operate in four areas: (a) assist the DGHE in its task of overseeing the higher&#13;
education system by making recommendations on higher education policies, identifying&#13;
local and national needs and new programs to be financed, and providing a medium- to long-&#13;
term perspective to the DGHE; (b) undertake the competitive funding for research and&#13;
graduate education through the existing University Research Council (URC), which was&#13;
established to assist the implementation of the URGE project and which is to be merged into&#13;
the BHE; and (c) introduce competitive funding mechanisms for undergraduate education&#13;
and implement projects (including the proposed project) which support such activities. The&#13;
BHE will also have an important role in assisting universities by providing technical&#13;
assistance and training to strengthen decentralized capacity for academic planning and&#13;
management. These initiatives would be supported under the project through the provision&#13;
of technical assistance, training, policy studies, equipment for the BHE Secretariat,&#13;
incremental operating costs, and workshops and technical assistance at individual institutions&#13;
of higher education. The Board of Higher Education (BHE) is an expansion of the&#13;
previously established University Research Council (URC). The BHE will have two&#13;
executive commissions to carry out its activities: the University Research Council and the&#13;
University Education Council. In addition to these two councils a set of discipline based&#13;
commissions will also be established, as well as Special and Ad-hoc sub-commissions or&#13;
Task Forces when necessary.&#13;
Structure of the Board for Higher Education: The BHE will be chaired by the&#13;
Director General of Higher Education with three Vice Chairs: the Vice Chair for University&#13;
Research, the Vice Chair for University Education, and the Vice Chair for Higher Education&#13;
Development. The Vice Chair for Research will serve as the Chairperson of the University&#13;
Research Council, responsible for overseeing the research aspects in the BHE. The Vice&#13;
Chair for Education will serve as Chair of the University Education Council, responsible for&#13;
overseeing the education aspects in the BHIE. The Vice Chair for Strategy will serve as the&#13;
Chair for the Task Force for Strategy, responsible for overseeing the strategy aspects in the&#13;
BHE.&#13;
Board  for Higher Education  Membership:   The BHE  will consist of&#13;
approximately sixteen members who have been selected on the basis of recognized expertise,&#13;
such as personal research experience, maintaining a balance with respect to domain of&#13;
expertise and institutional affiliation. Individual members will be recruited from DGHE,&#13;
universities, the National Research Council (DRN), and BAPPENAS, as well as from private&#13;
universities and enterprises. The Chairpersons of the University Research Council, the&#13;
University Education Council, the Higher Education Strategy Council, and the discipline&#13;
based commissions will also be members.&#13;

BHE Secretariat: The existing University Research Council Secretariat will be&#13;
expanded to become the BHE Secretariat, with two Assistants: the Assistant for Research&#13;
and the Assistant for Education. The function of the BHE's secretariat will be integrated into&#13;
the existing sub-directorates within the Directorate of Academic Affairs and Directorate of&#13;
Research and Community Service Development. The supervision of project implementation&#13;
will be the responsibility of the Secretariat. Specific responsibilities of the Assistant&#13;
Secretary in supervising the DUE project include: (i) reviewing reports submitted by the&#13;
CPIU; (ii) initiating and administering evaluation activities to be carried out by the UEC;&#13;
(iii) initiating and administering site visits conducted by the UEC members; (iv) providing&#13;
data analysis and information acquired from the CPIU, LPIUs, and other sources for the&#13;
UEC.&#13;
University Research Council (URC) : The University Research Council will be a&#13;
modification of the previously established University Research Council, adjusting its&#13;
structure within the new BHE. The URC will focus its activities on research and community&#13;
services. It will be chaired by the Director for Research with a membership consisting of the&#13;
Secretary, the BHE Vice Chair for Education, the chairs of the discipline based commissions,&#13;
and other academics with outstanding reputations. Research proposals will be reviewed by&#13;
members of the discipline-based commissions and special commissions, if needed, can draw&#13;
membership from the URC and UEC.&#13;
University Education Council (UEC) : The UEC will oversee graduate,&#13;
undergraduate, and professional education and be responsible for reviewing institutional&#13;
funding proposals. Based on the disciplines, programs, and proposals reviewed, it can draw&#13;
members from the discipline based sub-commissions as peer reviewers. The UEC will be&#13;
chaired by the Director for Academic Affairs, with membership consisting of a Secretary, the&#13;
BHE Vice Chair for Research, the chairs of the discipline based commissions, and other&#13;
academics with outstanding reputations.&#13;
Higher Education Development Council (HEDC): Council members are assigned to&#13;
carry out specific tasks in higher education development with the primary responsibility of&#13;
developing, improving, and modifying the long-term strategic plan for higher education. This&#13;
task will be carried out by monitoring the implementation of the strategic plan, evaluating&#13;
the results, soliciting input from the stakeholders, and modifying the existing plan as&#13;
necessary. The HEDC will be chaired by a non ex-officio member with commissions&#13;
members assigned to carry out the relevant tasks. The HEDC will be supported by the BHE&#13;
Secretariat.&#13;
Discipline-based commissions:  Seven discipline based commissions will be&#13;
established from the existing discipline based consortia. Members in each commission will&#13;
be grouped to carry out specific tasks and special and ad-hoc sub-commissions can draw&#13;
their membership from the relevant group of discipline-based commissions.&#13;

Membership of the National Accreditation Board: Ban will have 17 members: two&#13;
from the DGHE, seven from public universities, three from private universities, three from&#13;
industy, and two represent political parties in the country.&#13;
Roles and Responsibilities of the National Accreditation Board: The objective of&#13;
the BAN is to strengthen quality assurance within the higher education sub-sector in both&#13;
public and private institutions and to provide information pertaining to the performance of&#13;
higher education institutions and, when necessary, to recommend corrective actions. There&#13;
will be four levels of accreditation, A,B,C, and D, with A signifying the highest level of&#13;
accreditation. The primary task of the BAN will be to conduct periodic evaluations of study&#13;
&#13;

programs and institutions and judge the quality of the programs and the efficiency with&#13;
which they operate. Ban has developed:&#13;
* a set of criteria for each level of accreditation;&#13;
* policies and evaluation criteria for deternining the level of accreditation for programs&#13;
and institutions;&#13;
*  strategy for assisting higher education institutions in carrying out self assessments.&#13;
Activities of the National Accreditation Board: The process of accreditation will be&#13;
carried out for all higher education institutions, including public, private, and other&#13;
government agencies' service programs1. The initial accreditation process will take quite&#13;
some time to complete given that there are approximately 1,300 institutions of higher&#13;
education in Indonesia and 11,000 study programs.&#13;
The BAN will evaluate the following nine components at each higher education&#13;
institution and in each program seeking accreditation: (1) quality of the curriculum, (2)&#13;
quality of the teaching staff, (3) quality of the students, (4) quality of the teaching and&#13;
learning process, (5) the infrastructure, (6) quality of the academic administration, (7) quality&#13;
of personnel, (8) efficiency of the financial administration, and (9) the structure of the&#13;
intemal organization.2&#13;
In order to test the accreditation mechanism and tools, a pilot project was carried out&#13;
at ten public and five private universities involving programs in the faculties of medicine,&#13;
dentistry, psychology, and law. A draft evaluation sheet, which was developed by the Task&#13;
Force for Accreditation, was used in the process. Based on the pilot, revisions were made to&#13;
the evaluation sheet3.&#13;
X These include higher education institutions under government agencies other than Ministry of&#13;
Education and Culture, e.g. Ministry of Religion, Ministry of Health, etc.&#13;

Higher Education Support Project: Development of Undergraduate Education&#13;
Calculation of Economic Rate of Return&#13;
The economic rate of return for the investments to be undertaken in the Universities&#13;
Development Program component is estimated to be 24 percent. This estimate was obtained&#13;
by solving for the internal rate of return that equates the stream of benefits and costs&#13;
resulting from the investment over a twenty year horizon. This annex describes how the&#13;
estimate was made and provides an indication of how sensitive the estimate is to the&#13;
underlying assumptions.&#13;
Benefits&#13;
As no estimates of the positive extemalities from public investment in higher education are&#13;
available, a difference in eamings is taken as a measure of the social benefits of the&#13;
investment. The investments are expected to lead to higher lifetime eamings by:&#13;
1. Reducing the time needed for students to graduate - from 5.75 to 5.25 years;&#13;
2. Reducing the time needed for graduates to find their first job - from 1.75 to 1.5&#13;
years; and&#13;
3. Increasing starting salaries of graduates once employed by an average of US$&#13;
120 a year, with the differential growing by 3 percent a year.&#13;
Once explicit quantitative assumptions about the effect of the project on these key variables&#13;
are made, the calculation of the economic rate of return is a straightforward exercise of&#13;
working through the implications of these assumptions. Thus, the key consideration in&#13;
judging the economic rate of return lies with the reasonableness of the assumptions of the&#13;
program effects. Below we discuss why and how the project investments could be expected&#13;
to have the assumed effect.&#13;
Reduction in time neededfor students to graduate&#13;
The estimate of the current average time needed to graduate (5.75 years) is the median value&#13;
reported in the investment proposals submitted by the ten universities that made it into the&#13;
second round of competition. Through a variety of actions, the universities expect to be able&#13;
to reduce the time needed to graduate while maintaining quality constant. One approach&#13;
mentioned by virtually all universities is to use the research grants to help finance student&#13;
theses, the skripsis. The long time required to complete the skripsi was identified as a major&#13;
cause of the delays in graduation. In addition, the universities proposed several actions that&#13;
would have the effect of raising the value of the university professors time to work in the&#13;
public university rather than work in their second of third jobs. The increased attention that&#13;
the students would receive should also reduce the time needed to graduate. Finally, starting&#13;
the fourth year of the project, there will be an important incentive to reducing the time to&#13;
graduate. Failure to make satisfactory progress would constitute a remedy within the&#13;
contract signed by the university and the Board of Higher Education. As a result of the both&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-63-                               Annex 6&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
the investments and the incentive, the universities expected to be able to reduce the time&#13;
needed to graduate to an average of 5 years. The calculations of the economic rate of return&#13;
adopt the more conservative assumption that the average time to graduate would be reduced&#13;
to 5.25 years as a result of the project.&#13;
Reduction in waiting time and increase in salary once employed&#13;
The effect of the project on the waiting time to the first job and the earnings once employed&#13;
would be achieved through three mechanisms: a) being able to attract higher quality&#13;
students to the university; b) improvements in allocative efficiency; and c) improvements in&#13;
the quality of a specific program. As with the reduction in time to graduate, the&#13;
improvements in the quality of students would be achieved by a combination of investments&#13;
and incentives. To the extent that the investments raise the quality of the university and the&#13;
improvements are perceived, the university could expect to become relatively more attractive&#13;
to the higher quality students in their province. Of course, this effect would probably not be&#13;
felt immediately, but might take three or four years to occur. Beginning with the fourth year&#13;
of the project, failure to make adequate progress in attracting high quality students or in&#13;
reducing the waiting time for a job would constitute a remedy within the contract signed by&#13;
the university and the Board of Higher Education.&#13;
In their proposals, the ten universities set as a performance target a reduction in the average&#13;
waiting time from 1.75 to I year. The calculations of the economic rate of return adopt a&#13;
more conservative assumption, that the average waiting time would be reduced from 1.75 to&#13;
1.5 years. The current estimate of the average waiting provided by the universities may be&#13;
high. However, the calculations for the economic rate of return are sensitive to the&#13;
difference in the waiting time with and without the project, not on the absolute values. Thus,&#13;
even if the average waiting time is overestimated, as long as the reduction is of the order of&#13;
three months, the calculations presented here would remain valid.&#13;
As will be seen in this annex, the largest source of benefits arises from the assumed increase&#13;
in salary of the graduates who benefit from the project. Our assumption that the project&#13;
could lead to an increase in earnings of $10 a month is based on two observations.&#13;
First, note that the universities could improve allocative efficiency by concentrating their&#13;
improvements in fields in which they have a comparative advantage and which the market&#13;
values highly. Simulations based on data from a 1994 Tracer study of SI graduates from&#13;
1989, 1990 and 1991 provides some indication of the magnitude of this effect. This study&#13;
covers the graduates of 10 universities in and outside Java. While the study is flawed in that&#13;
it is based on a select group of graduates who chose to return the mail questionnaires (less&#13;
than 33 percent), it is one of the few surveys that provides information on earnings by field&#13;
of study and is sufficient for our illustrative purpose. If half of the graduates who are&#13;
' The study found substantial variation in earnings and waiting tirne to employment by field (and also by&#13;
the quality of the university). The average earnings of graduates in the highest paying field was over three&#13;
times those of the lowest paid field. Similarly, the field with the longest waiting time was over three times&#13;
that of the shortest. The correlation between average earnings and length of waiting time was -0.66 - the&#13;
longer the waiting time, the lower the earnings, as one might expect.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-64-                             Annex 6&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
employed in fields in the bottom fifty percent of earnings were instead to be employed in&#13;
fields in the top fifty percent of earnings, the average salary would rise by 12 percent. At the&#13;
mean starting salary reported by the ten universities of US$ 1,460 a year, a 12 percent&#13;
increase would amount to roughly $15 a month. This thought exercise overstates the case&#13;
somewhat because if students were to shift from lower to higher paying fields the change in&#13;
relative supply would have the effect of narrowing the wage differentials across fields.&#13;
Nevertheless, the simulation does suggest that if the selected universities were able to shift&#13;
students to higher paying fields, that effect alone could bring about an increase in wages of&#13;
the average graduate on the order of 10 percent. The substantial variation in earnings from&#13;
graduates of universities of different reputation suggest there is some scope for quality&#13;
improvements in the universities selected in this project to raise earnings. Any quality&#13;
improvements made in individual programs could also be expected to raise future earnings&#13;
Second, an increase of $10 a month is roughly compatible with a shift in the earnings of&#13;
graduates from the nth to the n+lOth percentile of earnings of university graduates in the&#13;
provinces in which the universities are located. We assume that the project investments&#13;
could bring about such a shift in the eamings of graduates. From the I 0th through the 70th&#13;
percentiles, earnings increase by approximately $15 a month for each ten points. The&#13;
percentile distributions are based on reported earnings from the 1992 Sakernas Labor Force&#13;
survey expressed in 1995 Rupiah, inflated using provincial price indices reported by BPS.&#13;
The mean starting salary reported by the ten universities was US$ 1,460 a year, which lies&#13;
between the 50th and 60th percentile of salaries averaged over the provinces where the&#13;
universities are located. Thus, what the universities report appears to be consistent with other&#13;
data. The 3 percent growth rate in the differential is included to reflect the widening of wage&#13;
differentials that tends to occur over time.&#13;
Effect on number of graduates&#13;
The investments are not expected to lead to an increase in the number of students enrolled in&#13;
any given year. In the Indonesian higher education system, there is an excess demand for the&#13;
places within public universities and positions are rationed. Even poor public universities&#13;
receive many more applicants than they can accept. Thus, the number of enrolled students is&#13;
not dependent on demand. It depends on administrative decisions made in the public&#13;
university system on how many students they. would like to have enrolled in any year. We&#13;
assume that the investments do not lead to an increase in the number enrolled in any year.&#13;
However, if the time that students take to graduate can be reduced, more students could be&#13;
admitted without affecting the number enrolled at any one time. Indeed, this ability to have&#13;
more students pass through the system is an important part of the expected gains from the&#13;
investment.&#13;

As indicated in the disbursement profile, the US$68.1 million investment is expected to be&#13;
spread out over six years, with 5 percent invested the first year, 10 percent the second, 30&#13;
percent the third, 22 percent in the fourth and fifth years and 11 percent in the sixth year.&#13;
After the six year period and in each year up to the end of the twenty year horizon, ten&#13;
percent of the original investment of US$68.1 million is expected to be spent on maintaining&#13;
the gains of the original investment. Although these expenses would be expected to come&#13;
out of other sources of funds and not from the project, they are included in the calculation of&#13;
the economic rate of return. The universities have provided for this 10 percent to come out&#13;
of their DRK budget.&#13;
The Calculations&#13;
A simulation model was used to project how the number of graduates employed each year&#13;
would vary with changes in the time spent to graduate and with changes in the waiting time&#13;
to a job as a result of the investments. In keeping with the assumption that enrollments&#13;
would not change, the simulation model assumes for all cases that the yearly inflow of&#13;
students would equal the yearly outflow. Because the number of students enrolled in any&#13;
one year is the same with or without the investment, the opportunity costs to being in school&#13;
will be the same with or without the investment. As the net benefits to the investment&#13;
depend on the difference in benefit and cost streams with and without the investment, the&#13;
opportunity costs will cancel out.&#13;
With or without the investments it is assumed that in any year 66,315 students would be&#13;
enrolled. This is equal to 80 percent of the current enrollment in the 10 universities. It is&#13;
expected that up to seven universities would be selected for funding. The figure of 80&#13;
percent was chosen (instead of 70 percent) because after reading the individual proposals it&#13;
appeared that some of the larger universities are more likely to be funded.&#13;
Based on the current mean time to graduate of 5.75 years, the implied yearly inflow and&#13;
outflow of students that would keep enrollment constant is 11,532 (66,315/5.75). The&#13;
simulation assumes that the time needed to graduate would decline gradually from 5.75 years&#13;
to 5.5 years. After the first year of the investments, the outflow of students would accelerate&#13;
steadily until it reached 12,628 which (except for some minor rounding errors) is equal to the&#13;
total enrollment divided by the target mean time to graduate (5.25 years).&#13;
The waiting time to employment is also assumed to decline gradually over time with the&#13;
investments. For simplicity, the simulation assumes that the waiting time is determninistic.&#13;
Without the investments, all graduates are assumed to wait 1.75 years before becoming&#13;
employed. With the investments, after the initial year the waiting time to employment is&#13;
assumed to decline steadily until it reaches 1.5 years after the fifth year of the investment. It&#13;
would be possible to make the waiting time a random variable, but this is unlikely to change&#13;
the results in any significant way.&#13;
&#13;

The major source of benefits from the reduced waiting time is that, after the adjustment to&#13;
the change in time to graduate and waiting time, there are fewer graduates unemployed in&#13;
any one year. In the base case, there are 20,181 graduateswaiting to be employed in the&#13;
steady state. With the assumed changes brought about by the project, there would be 18,942&#13;
graduates waiting to be employed even with the higher outfolw of graduates.&#13;
Results&#13;
Given the assumptions related to the stream of benefits and costs, the economic rate of return&#13;
is estimated to be 24 percent. The numbers used in the calculation of the return are&#13;
presented in Table 1.&#13;
While the cost side is straightforward, it is of interest to see what the relative contribution of&#13;
the three sources of increased earnings are to total benefits. To calculate the relative&#13;
contribution, the stream of benefits from each source are first converted to their present value&#13;
(assuming a discount rate of 10 percent). The largest contribution to total benefits arises&#13;
from the increased salary after employment (81 percent), followed by the benefits from&#13;
reducing the time spent in school (11 percent) and the benefits from having fewer graduates&#13;
waiting for employment at any one time (8 percent). Even though the effect of the project on&#13;
the monthly earnings of any one graduate are small (US$10), there are many graduates who&#13;
would benefit. Moreover, the benefits would be received for many years. The benefits from&#13;
having fewer graduates waiting for employment are large because the opportunity cost of&#13;
having a potential worker idle are substantial. These costs are assumed to be US$ 1460,&#13;
which is equal to the mean of the starting salary reported by the ten universities.&#13;
The benefits from reducing the time spent in school makes a significant difference to the&#13;
total number of students who pass through the system. In twenty years, roughly 25,000 (7&#13;
percent) more students would graduate after 20 years if the mean time to graduate were to&#13;
decline from 5.75 to 5.25 years, with no change in the number enrolled at any given time.&#13;
Without the investments, these students would be expected to go to private universities&#13;
where previous econometric work has suggested that returns are 9 percent lower. The&#13;
calculations assume that the difference in earnings a student could obtain from going to an&#13;
improved public university versus the existing private university is US$190 (equivalent to&#13;
the difference between the 30th and 50th percentile of earnings of University graduates in the&#13;
provinces of the 10 Universities). This premium would be earned every year after&#13;
graduation.&#13;
Sensitivity to assumptions&#13;
In order to calculate the effect of different assumptions on the estimated economic rate of&#13;
return, several additional simulations were run. The results are as follows:&#13;

Higher Education Support Project: Development of Undergraduate Education&#13;
Project Implementation Plan&#13;
The Structure and Functions of the CPCU and the LPIU's&#13;
Organizational Framework - Overview: The implementation arrangements for the&#13;
project comprise a number of governmental as well as independent bodies, both at the&#13;
central level and at the level of individual universities. The Directorate General of Higher&#13;
Education  (DGHE) under the Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC) will have&#13;
responsibility for overseeing project implementation. In addition, DGHE will implement the&#13;
fellowship program. The BAN and the BHE will be responsible for implementing their&#13;
respective parts of the project. At the level of the six individual target institutions,&#13;
implementation responsibility will lie with Local Project Implementation Units (LPIUs)&#13;
which have evolved out of the University Task Forces which prepared the individual&#13;
universities' proposals. At the central level, a small Central Project Coordination Unit&#13;
(CPCU) located within the BHE Secretariat within DGHE will be responsible not for&#13;
implementing the project, as in the past, but only for providing training, monitoring, and&#13;
technical assistance to the LPIUs and for overall coordination of project activities. The&#13;
CPCU is de facto already established in the form of the existing Project Preparation Team&#13;
within DGHE. The structure, roles and responsibilities of the implementing agencies are&#13;
summarized briefly below.'&#13;
Structure of the Central Project Coordination Unit (CPCU): The proposed project will&#13;
be managed by the Central Project Coordination Unit (CPCU). The CPCU will report to the&#13;
Assistant Secretary for Education at the BHE Secretariat. The CPCU will comprise of a&#13;
CPCU Director, a financial officer, two procurement officers, and clerical staff. The CPCU&#13;
Director will be appointed by the DGHE.&#13;
Roles and Responsibilities of the Central Project Coordination Unit : The overall&#13;
responsibility of the CPCU is overseeing and managing the project implementation through&#13;
intensive monitoring and supervision. Specific responsibilities are:&#13;
*  to administer the grant agreement between the CPCU and the LPIUs;&#13;
*  to prepare the budget for the BHE and BAN activities, and handle the corresponding&#13;
financial matters;&#13;
*  to administer the Competitive Domestic Fellowship Program;&#13;
*  to prepare progress reports for the Bank;&#13;
*  to submit periodic reports to the Secretariat;&#13;
*  to monitor project expenditures by periodically collecting standardized format reports&#13;
from the LPIUs and prepare consolidated financial statements and submit audited&#13;
statements of accounts to the Bank;&#13;
For a detailed description of the structure, role and functions of the BHE and the BAN, please refer to&#13;
Annexes 4 and 5 respectively.&#13;

*  to closely monitor procurement activities, take corrective actions for any deviation&#13;
found, and report it to the Secretariat as soon as possible;&#13;
*  to assist and supervise universities in reporting and collecting data for monitoring and&#13;
evaluation;&#13;
*  to provide necessary management training and technical assistance to the LPIUs;&#13;
*  to liaise with the LPIUs and the Bank on all project related matters.&#13;
Structure of the Local Project Implementation Unit (LPIU): The Implementing unit at&#13;
the target universities will be the Local Project Implementation Unit (LPIU). The Vice&#13;
Rector for Academic Affairs will be, ex-officio, become the Director of the LPIU. Due to&#13;
his/her routine responsibilities as the Vice Rector, however, an Executive Director will be&#13;
needed to carry out the day to day activities. The Executive Director will supervise two&#13;
deputies: Academic Affairs, and Finance and Administration. Officers in charge of the LPIU&#13;
will be appointed by the Rector after acquiring approval from the Education Commission.&#13;
Roles and Responsibilities of the Local Project Implementation Unit (LPIU): The LPIU&#13;
is responsible for project implementation at the target university level. The Vice Rector I will&#13;
chair the LPIU and an Executive Director will be appointed to oversee day-to-day&#13;
operations, the Executive Director will report to the Vice-Rector I on progress, problems&#13;
encountered and actions taken to resolve problems. Specifically the Executive Director will&#13;
ensure communication and cooperation between the Academic and Finance and&#13;
Administration units. Integration of the tasks of these two units is critical to successful&#13;
implementation. The Academic unit will conduct a needs analysis for equipment, civil&#13;
works, technical assistance and staff development and prepare appropriate terms of reference&#13;
and specifications and, in conjunction with the Finance and Administration unit, prepare&#13;
tender documents. The Finance and Administration unit will then conduct the tender process,&#13;
evaluate bids and prepare contracts based on standard Bank guidelines for procurement of&#13;
goods and services and guidelines for recruitment of technical assistance. Especially in the&#13;
procurement of equipment and civil works the two units will jointly assume responsibility&#13;
for checking equipment received and works carried out and for coordinating the installation&#13;
and commissioning process to ensure that equipment and civil works ordered, and received,&#13;
matches the needs identified by the end users.&#13;
In carrying out its task, the LPIU can draw expertise from other sources such as the CPCU,&#13;
technical assistance from universities which have already developed experience and&#13;
expertise in these tasks, and domestic as well as international consultants.&#13;
The organizational chart below shows the relationship between the various bodies involved&#13;
in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the universities development program.&#13;

Indonesia&#13;
Higher Education Support Project: Development of Undergraduate Education&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation'&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.     The basic goals of this project are to speed Indonesia's economic and social&#13;
development and enhance its ability to compete in an ever widening global marketplace.&#13;
Specifically, the project seeks to improve the quality of SI education and to assist the&#13;
Government of Indonesia take the first steps in operationalizing the New Paradigm which&#13;
emphasizes mechanisms to enhance bottom-up, decentralized planning and performance&#13;
based resource allocation for universities.  The project includes activities designed to&#13;
improve Indonesia's higher education system at both the sector level and at the university&#13;
level.&#13;
2.      As part of a five year effort, the monitoring and evaluation component plays an&#13;
important role in gauging the overall success of the new institutional framework as well as&#13;
efforts by less established universities to improve their overall quality, relevancy and&#13;
efficiency. Numerous and varied activities will be planned and implemented in the six target&#13;
universities. Each institution has prepared a self-evaluation and has submitted a limited plan&#13;
for its development. The challenge to the monitoring and evaluation component will be to&#13;
define a single set of cogent indicators that will allow us to track progress within institutions&#13;
and maintain validity, given the multiple groups responsible for gathering and processing&#13;
information. Monitoring and evaluation will be carried out by each LPIU as well as the&#13;
CPCU and the DGHE, at intervals sufficiently frequent to permit feedback and continual&#13;
program improvement.&#13;
3.      The tables that follow present the designated performance indicators to be used in&#13;
monitoring and evaluating the project components and to be used during supervision. There&#13;
is also a discussion of how and when they will be measured. The targets specified in the&#13;
monitoring and evaluation matrix are average figures. The indicators are not meant to be&#13;
applied to each of the institutions individually but to the average performance of the group as&#13;
a whole.&#13;
Monitoring tracks the process of carrying out activities necessary for program implementation. This can be&#13;
accomplished through recording and reporting from service delivery sites, supervisory sites, and periodic&#13;
program reviews. Monitoring is an integral part of evaluation; it is used to measure process objectives, that is,&#13;
to determine if and to what extent activities are being implemented as planned. Evaluation measures the progress&#13;
of the program to outcome objectives which specify changes in behavior or services as a result of the project&#13;
activities. The term evaluation also includes operational research designed to answer questions related to&#13;
interventions and services. For example, the effectiveness of two different approaches to teaching reading, or the&#13;
effectiveness of distance education compared to traditional classroom lectures.&#13;
&#13;

The Nature of Education Indicators&#13;
4.     Indicators are typically quantified measurements that can be repeated over time to&#13;
track the progress toward the achievement of objectives. They are normally expressed as&#13;
numbers, proportions, percentages and ratios. Education indicators attempt to characterize&#13;
the success or effectiveness of an education system, institution or program by serving as a&#13;
proxy for some educational component or relationship.&#13;
5.    Caution  is necessary  when  evaluating  education  projects, especially  when&#13;
interpreting educational indicators. First, the interpretation of educational indicators is&#13;
innately subjective2. Typically, indicators are presented as being "value-neutral" measures&#13;
of performance while in reality they are based on some value judgment about the desired&#13;
effects of education. Windham (1992) gives the example of two institutions: one with a&#13;
statistic indicating an 80 percent graduation rate, and the other a 20 percent graduation rate.&#13;
The statistic does not become an indicator until it is attached to some goal. If the goal is&#13;
maximizing the rate of graduation, the first program would appear more successful. If&#13;
increasing the total number of graduates is the goal, the second program could also be&#13;
considered successful if for example, the population was less advantaged students who might&#13;
normally not graduate at all. It is critical therefor that the goals and objectives of a project&#13;
are stated clearly and that there is agreement with their interpretation.&#13;
6.     Second, education is more complex and difficult to summarize than activities in other&#13;
social sectors such as health and nutrition. It is relatively straightforward to evaluate the&#13;
results of a vaccination or feeding program, but providing better quality schooling is more&#13;
difficult to measure. For evaluating education programs, indicator sets are more valuable&#13;
than single indicators because issues such as cost, equity and learning effectiveness need to&#13;
be considered simultaneously to evaluate the true impact of an intervention.&#13;
7.     Finally, since education is a relatively long-term process, interventions must also be&#13;
long term. This increases the costs of monitoring and evaluation because these activities&#13;
must occur over the life of the project. A single time slice measurement is inappropriate,&#13;
when in fact, a programs' impact may not be seen for several years. In the case of higher&#13;
education, the impact may not be realized until the beneficiaries enter the labor market.&#13;
Project Monitoring&#13;
8.     During appraisal it was agreed that a core group of indicators would be utilized to&#13;
monitor and evaluate the impact of the overall project. Three indicators were chosen: one&#13;
each for quality, efficiency and relevancy&#13;
2 The section on educational indicators relies heavily on a paper by Douglas Windhamn. 1992. "Educationfor All"&#13;
Indicators: A Proposed Framework Manual, and Implementation Plan. A Report prepared for UNICEF.&#13;

9.    Benchmark Test. To monitor quality. a Benchmark Test will be administered at the&#13;
target institutions to all students at the beginning of the project, at mid-term evaluation, and&#13;
at project completion . It is expected that by the end of the project, the mean score on the&#13;
benchmark test will have increased by 10% over the score at the beginning of the project.&#13;
The test is currently being developed and will be administered and scored by the BHE.&#13;
Students will take the test at their respective universities.&#13;
10.   Decrease in Mean Cycle Cost. A decrease in the mean cycle cost by program will&#13;
be used to measure efficiency. Cycle cost was chosen because it takes into account both the&#13;
unit cost and the length of study. It is expected that mean cycle cost will decrease by 10%&#13;
over the life of the project. The LPIU at each university will be responsible for measuring&#13;
this indicator and forwarding it to the CPCU in its annual evaluation.&#13;
11.   Decrease in Mean Job Search Time. A decrease in the mean job search time of&#13;
graduates will be used to measure increased relevance of undergraduate education. By the&#13;
end of the project, it is expected that 50% of students will find employment in their&#13;
respective fields within six months of graduation. Although no baseline is presently&#13;
available, this target is believed to represent a substantial improvement over the present&#13;
situation.  Baseline information is being collected and will be available when the&#13;
universities' final proposals have been evaluated. Mean job search time will be monitored by&#13;
the LPIU and forwarded to the CPCU via the annual report.&#13;
Project Monitoring&#13;
12.   To implement the New Paradigm, the Government plans to strengthen institutional&#13;
capacity both at the center and at individual universities. The Board of Higher Education&#13;
(BHE) will make use of the existing MIS for monitoring the higher education system.&#13;
Lessons learned from the implementation and evaluation of the proposed project will be&#13;
applied to future higher education policies and practices. The CPCU will be responsible for&#13;
monitoring and assisting the LPIUs in implementing their respective projects and for&#13;
collecting and analyzing data from the target universities. They will also provide the&#13;
background information needed for the BHE.&#13;
Component Monitoring&#13;
12.   Less Established Universities. The objective of this component is to improve the&#13;
quality of S1 education in six of the less established universities. At the university level, the&#13;
Rector will establish (1) a Local Project Implementation Unit which will be responsible for&#13;
project implementation and monitoring, and (2) a Task Force whose responsibility will be to&#13;
gather information on established baseline indicators. The LPIU will prepare semi-annual&#13;
and annual reports on the indicators cited as well as any problems that might have been&#13;
encountered and actions to ameliorate them. These reports will be submitted to the&#13;
Education Secretariat CPCU of the Board of Higher Education&#13;
13.   As presented in the SAR, two sets of indicators will be used (paras. 3.24 - 3.26). The&#13;
first will consist of those which can be measured in the short-run: the Secondary School&#13;
Leaving Examination score of incoming students, student GPA, results on the UMPTN,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

change in teaching practices, the proportion of civil works completed and the proportion of&#13;
goods procured. The second, which are long-term in nature, will be based on the results of a&#13;
tracer study and the established baseline indicators. These are outlined in the accompanying&#13;
grid. In addition to the generic set of indicators, process indicators for each institution will&#13;
be individually determined will be determined on a case by case basis and be linked to&#13;
specific proposals.&#13;
14.   Board of Higher Education. The DGHE will assign a technical auditing tearn to&#13;
monitor the activities of the BHE and the CPCU on an annual and semi-annual basis using&#13;
the indicators in Table 1.&#13;
15.   National Accreditation Board.  The CPCU will monitor the BAN. Annual&#13;
monitoring of established baseline indicators will occur&#13;

an examination of (i) progress reports and site visits of beneficiary institutions, and (ii)&#13;
documentation of program monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
For each beneficiary institution visited, the Team will identify specific elements of&#13;
the reported progress or activities that should be verified during the site visit. Specific&#13;
elements to be audited at each university will depend on the contents of the individual&#13;
institution's proposals. These elements will be added to the general items listed in III below.&#13;
Prior to conducting site visits, the Team shall obtain documents describing the monitoring&#13;
and evaluation activities carried out by the appropriate staff, in conjunction with World Bank&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Higher Education Support Project
            (Development of Undergraduate Education) has three
            objectives: 1) to improve the quality of undergraduate
            education; 2) to improve the efficiency of the educational
            process; and 3) to improve the relevance of the study
            programs offered. Achieving these objectives will lead to
            increased earnings for graduates of the six target
            universities. The project will support a first phase of
            activities at the institutional level as well as supporting
            activities at the sector level. It will consist of the
            following components: 1) universities development program;
            2) institutional capacity-building in higher education; 3)
            implementation of a national accreditation system for higher
            education; 4) competitive domestic fellowship program; and
            5) project administration.
