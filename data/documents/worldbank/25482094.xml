Report of Committee under Section 4 (iii) of Article III of the Articles of Agreement on the&#13;
Proposed Loan (Reducing Inequality of Educational Opportunity Project) to the United Mexican&#13;

The undersigned Committee constituted under Section 7 of Article V of the Articles of&#13;
Agreement of International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) hereby submits its&#13;
report pursuant to Section 4 (iii) of Article III of said Articles in respect of the proposal that the Bank&#13;
grant to the United Mexican States (the Borrower) a loan in an amount of $150,000,000. The purposes of&#13;
said loan are: (a) to improve parental competencies in early childhood development in targeted rural&#13;
communities; and (b) increase the transition rate from the primary to the secondary education level in&#13;
CONAFE-administered schools in targeted municipalities.&#13;
1.   The Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to grant such a loan, and of the&#13;
purposes to which the proceeds of the loan are to be applied.&#13;
2.   The Committee is of the opinion that the Project in support of which the proceeds of such loan are&#13;
to be applied comes within the purposes of the Bank as set forth in Article I of said Articles of Agreement,&#13;
and that said Project is designed to promote the development of the productive facilities and resources of&#13;
the United Mexican States and is in the interest of the United Mexican States and of the members of the&#13;
Bank as a whole.&#13;
