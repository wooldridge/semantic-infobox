PMR Governance Framework&#13;
Adopted on April 11, 2011&#13;
(provided for informational purposes only)&#13;
PARTNERSHIP FOR MARKET READINESS (PMR)&#13;
PMR Governance Framework&#13;
1.    Objectives of the PMR&#13;
1.1   The PMR aims to provide a platform for technical discussions and the exchange&#13;
of information on market instruments for mitigation, and to help interested&#13;
countries build capacity for scaling up their mitigation efforts through market&#13;
instruments1, and to pilot instruments appropriate to their domestic context.&#13;
1.2   The PMR intends to achieve the following objectives:&#13;
(a)   to provide grant financing to countries for building market readiness&#13;
components;&#13;
(b)   to pilot, test and sequence new concepts for market instruments, both for&#13;
domestic and new international mechanisms, and to identify potential synergies&#13;
between national market based instruments at an early stage;&#13;
(c)   to create a platfo-m to enable policy makers of government agencies,&#13;
practitioners, and public and private entities to share experiences and information&#13;
regarding elements of market readiness, to learn from one another, promote south-&#13;
south cooperation, and explore and innovate together on new instruments and&#13;
approaches;&#13;
(d)   to create and disseminate a body of knowledge on market instruments that&#13;
could be tapped for country-specific requirements; and&#13;
(e)   to share lessons learned, including with the UNFCCC.&#13;
2.    Operating Principles&#13;
For the purpose of the PMR, market instruments refer to domestic instruments (e.g., emissions trading&#13;
scheme) and, without prejudging the outcomes under the United Nations Framework Convention on&#13;
Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations, scaled-up market mechanisms.&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿2.1   Building on the objectives, the PMR will operate in accordance with the following&#13;
principles:&#13;
(a)   to be country-led and to build on nationally defined and prioritized&#13;
mitigation policies, according to each implementing country's national&#13;
circumstances;&#13;
(b)   to coordinate with other readiness efforts to avoid duplication and ensure&#13;
effective use of resources;&#13;
(c)   to cooperate with :ther actors and processes that are undertaking similar&#13;
initiatives, such as IN agencies and other multilateral development banks; and&#13;
(d)   to promote learning-by-doing through early and integrated efforts.&#13;
3. Activities for Support&#13;
3.1   The activities to be supported by the PMR will be developed on a country-specific&#13;
basis and will build on the country's existing initiatives to meet nationally defined&#13;
priorities. As countries' :echnical and institutional capacities differ, the PMR&#13;
resources may be used to undertake the activities that serve the objectives of the&#13;
PMR set out in Section I (Objectives of the PMR) above, which may include some&#13;
or all of the following activities:&#13;
(a)   Assessment - Carrying out a feasibility and capacity assessment for&#13;
utilizing market mechanisms within a portfolio of policy instruments in the&#13;
context of the country's mitigation strategies, including analysis and appraisal of&#13;
national, sub-national and sectoral approaches.&#13;
(b)   Data - Building or enhancing capacity of data collection systems and&#13;
institutional capacity for data reporting and management and for setting up&#13;
activity reference level.&#13;
(c)   Measurement, Reporting and Verifying (MRV) - Designing or enhancing&#13;
existing MRV frameworks to ensure transparency, quality, credibility and&#13;
consistency with international good practice.&#13;
(d)   Institutional capacity - Carrying out capacity building activities that aim&#13;
to engage with key stakeholders early in the planning process and help the&#13;
responsible government agencies organize cross-agency dialogues and broader&#13;
consultations.&#13;
(e)   Policy and legal fiameworks - Facilitating the design of policy and legal&#13;
frameworks for implemer:ation of market instruments.&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿(f)   Piloting and testing - Learning-by-doing is one of the most efficient&#13;
means to gain experience, improve capacity and develop effective instruments. If&#13;
a country so wishes, a pilot program could be set up to test a market instrument&#13;
selected by the country.&#13;
