&amp;#12;                   Interview with Ernest Stern&#13;
                          The World Bank&#13;
                        December 29, 1994&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   As I recall, we had gotten you all the way through the&#13;
&#13;
Pearson Commission Report. After that, you returned to AID&#13;
&#13;
for a three-year stint as an Assistant Administrator in&#13;
&#13;
Policy and Program Administration.    Can you talk a little bit&#13;
&#13;
about that?&#13;
&#13;
A:   In those days that was the locus for the general&#13;
&#13;
oversight of AID's programs. It handled economic strategies,&#13;
&#13;
budget issues, and presentations to the Congress for&#13;
&#13;
appropriations.    I was involved in the review of our country&#13;
&#13;
programs; allocation decisions; strategy formulation and&#13;
&#13;
chief budget officer. It was the third-ranking position in&#13;
&#13;
the agency.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did you have line authority?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I had a lot of line authority; the unit was large with a&#13;
&#13;
range of responsibilities.    I didn't have any operating&#13;
&#13;
authority, if that's what you mean.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Yes.&#13;
&#13;
A:   I wasn't responsible for country programs directly. The&#13;
&#13;
regional bureaus handled that.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did you directly succeed Hollis Chenery in this&#13;
&#13;
position?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.    There were a few years between Hollis and me.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   This was a period of great political turmoil in the U.S.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (12/29/94), Page 2&#13;
&#13;
Did that affect your relationships with Congress and the&#13;
&#13;
other executive agencies?&#13;
&#13;
A:   The U.S. AID program has always been under a lot of&#13;
&#13;
pressure from the Congress. This also was true back then. AID&#13;
&#13;
was in its heyday. The arrival of the Kennedy administration&#13;
&#13;
had rejuvenated the agency by attracting a large number of&#13;
&#13;
first-rate people and by succeeding in increasing&#13;
&#13;
appropriations. This momentum began to diminish, however,&#13;
&#13;
before the end of the Johnson administration. The war in&#13;
&#13;
Vietnam significantly limited the scope of our operations.&#13;
&#13;
Strategic interests dominated.   Moreover, it was also a&#13;
&#13;
period of increasing concern with the budget. There were&#13;
&#13;
heavy cuts and tense debates in the Congress and between the&#13;
&#13;
Administration and Congress over how the remaining monies&#13;
&#13;
would be distributed.&#13;
&#13;
     When Nixon arrived at the White House in 1969, the&#13;
&#13;
Administration attempted to rewrite the AID legislation,&#13;
&#13;
making a difficult period even more difficult. But the&#13;
&#13;
revised program was not well received in the Congress.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   The Nixon Administration was noted for trying to push&#13;
&#13;
allegiance to the White House a little further down into the&#13;
&#13;
Administration. Did that impact you at all?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.   I was nominated for my job, which required Senate&#13;
&#13;
confirmation. But it was a technical appointment. My&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (12/29/94), Page 3&#13;
&#13;
confirmation hearings were probably among the shortest on&#13;
&#13;
record.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Evaluating AID's program from your position, did you see&#13;
&#13;
major changes on the immediate horizon?   We are now dealing&#13;
&#13;
with '69 to '72.   Did you see changes in the global economy&#13;
&#13;
that altered the whole aid process?&#13;
&#13;
A:   If you go back in the history of AID, you will see that,&#13;
&#13;
between 1961 and 1969, there was a steady erosion of the&#13;
&#13;
development assistance program in the U.S.     It was reflected&#13;
&#13;
both in the amounts of money that were made available, and,&#13;
&#13;
more seriously, in the micro management by Congress of the&#13;
&#13;
use of funds.   This made it very difficult for AID to&#13;
&#13;
operate. Our activities became more time-consuming and more&#13;
&#13;
inefficient. A lot of good people left the Agency as a&#13;
&#13;
result. Increasingly, the U.S. Government viewed foreign aid&#13;
&#13;
more as an appendage to its strategic-military interests than&#13;
&#13;
as a development vehicle. Political/diplomatic support of US&#13;
&#13;
positions became an increasingly important criterion. During&#13;
&#13;
this period AID became less and less relevant to serious&#13;
&#13;
efforts at supporting development.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   At that point,   (up through '72) was the environmental&#13;
&#13;
issue becoming an important concern for you?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No. I don't think so.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   It wasn't on the scope at all at that point?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (12/29/94), Page 4&#13;
A:   ~.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Are you familiar with the Bank at this time?&#13;
&#13;
A:   If we are still in the same time frame, I joined the&#13;
&#13;
Bank at the beginning of 1972. Before then, I knew the Bank&#13;
&#13;
existed, and broadly what it did - I saw it in action both in&#13;
&#13;
India and Pakistan - but I certainly wasn't very well&#13;
&#13;
acquainted with the institution.   Most of AID's work was&#13;
&#13;
bilateral in nature. Occasionally, we had contact with&#13;
&#13;
international organizations, generally in the context of&#13;
&#13;
Consultative Groups, or the joint financing of very large&#13;
&#13;
projects. And those relations were mostly by the operating&#13;
&#13;
departments.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   At this time (1968), McNamara was already at the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
He was introducing new policies and new programs. How did&#13;
&#13;
these initiatives look to you from the outside.&#13;
&#13;
A:   So far as I remember, it didn't register very much.&#13;
&#13;
Don't forget McNamara's reorganization didn't come till 1972.&#13;
&#13;
The. Bank's expansion also was gradual.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   That's another thing that wasn't on your screen.    So the&#13;
&#13;
Bank isn't looming large as far as USAID is concerned?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No; during most of this period at AID, the US was the&#13;
&#13;
major donor - bilaterally and multilaterally - and it had the&#13;
&#13;
broadest economic development research programs.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Were there any new initiatives, given this setting?     It&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (12/29/94), Page 5&#13;
&#13;
must have been a little harder to innovate at that point, but&#13;
&#13;
were there any new programs that you were trying to promote?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.   I don't think so.   During this period, we primarily&#13;
&#13;
tried to reshape our programs into forms that were more&#13;
&#13;
marketable. We were in a holding pattern -- a period of&#13;
&#13;
consolidation. And we were fighting to maintain a development&#13;
&#13;
agency which did not have support from the Administration and&#13;
&#13;
was under strong pressure in the Congress. There was a&#13;
&#13;
renewed effort at support for the private sector in&#13;
&#13;
developing countries; greater emphasis on business&#13;
&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Now, at some point in the midst of this holding action,&#13;
&#13;
you decided to move to the Bank.    Could you talk to us a&#13;
&#13;
little bit about that decision?&#13;
&#13;
A:   After my stint at the Pearson Commission I became the&#13;
&#13;
Assistant Administrator at AID. None of the ideas and&#13;
&#13;
concepts of the Pearson report found an echo in the US&#13;
&#13;
approach to its aid programs. The Congressional view of aid,&#13;
&#13;
and AID, and the budget situation; the fiscal pressures of&#13;
&#13;
Viet Nam and the increasingly political nature of the US&#13;
&#13;
assistance program; the philosophy of the Nixon&#13;
&#13;
Administration and its approach to aid; the erosion of the&#13;
&#13;
intellectual capacity of AID and the declining interest in&#13;
&#13;
development in US academic institutions generally all&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (12/29/94), Page 6&#13;
contributed to making AID an increasingly unattractive place&#13;
&#13;
to work. Nonetheless, I stuck it out for a little over two&#13;
&#13;
years. Early in 1971, if I have my dates right, the White&#13;
&#13;
House decided to establish a Council on International&#13;
&#13;
Economic Policy, which was supposed to be the counterpart to&#13;
&#13;
the National Security Council and the Domestic Council. Peter&#13;
&#13;
Peterson (former businessman and Secretary of Commerce) was&#13;
&#13;
appointed to head it. There were three Senior Staff members -&#13;
&#13;
one for trade, one for OECD countries and one for the&#13;
&#13;
developing countries.   To my surprise I was offered the&#13;
&#13;
latter position. While I was never optimistic about the&#13;
&#13;
viability of the Council I accepted the position. I suppose I&#13;
&#13;
thought that it might be possible to make the developing&#13;
&#13;
countries more relevant to US decision making. We were&#13;
&#13;
located in the Old Executive Office Building. Foresight or&#13;
&#13;
luck made me retain my position at AID and to take the CIEP&#13;
&#13;
position for a six months trial period. By the end of that&#13;
&#13;
time, the Fall of 1971, it had become pretty clear that the&#13;
&#13;
CIEP could not live up to its purposes and that any&#13;
&#13;
expectation of getting greater attention to the US role in&#13;
&#13;
the developing countries was illusory. And the specifics of&#13;
&#13;
just how politically the US assistance program was viewed&#13;
&#13;
became quite stark. So when I finally realized that the White&#13;
&#13;
House and the White House staff weren't really interested in&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (12/29/94), Page 7&#13;
&#13;
development, I resigned my position on the White House&#13;
&#13;
Council on International Economic Policy and returned to AID.&#13;
&#13;
It was then also very clear that it made no sense for me to&#13;
&#13;
continue to serve the Nixon Administration in AID. So I&#13;
&#13;
called Hollis Chenery one day and asked him if there were any&#13;
&#13;
opportunities at the Bank. Fortunately, he said yes. He asked&#13;
&#13;
me if I would administer the Bank's research program. It was&#13;
&#13;
not exactly my forte, but I desperately wanted to get out of&#13;
&#13;
AID.&#13;
&#13;
       I accepted Hollisâ&#128;¢ offer. I gave up my huge office,&#13;
&#13;
three secretaries, and my private bathroom and came over to&#13;
&#13;
the Bank where I shared a secretary, had a small office and&#13;
&#13;
no title. But it was a very different, more congenial&#13;
&#13;
intellectual environment and the subject was, once again,&#13;
&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Can you give us a little picture of that economic&#13;
&#13;
research program?&#13;
&#13;
A:     It wasn't what the Bank has today.   There were many&#13;
&#13;
separate projects, but no coordination or systematic&#13;
&#13;
oversight. It was financed by the administrative budget. I&#13;
&#13;
was asked to organize the research program so we could keep&#13;
&#13;
track of what projects we were doing; begin to develop some&#13;
&#13;
priorities; broaden participation with other researchers. We&#13;
&#13;
developed a separate research fund so that projects could be&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          Stern (12/29/94), Page 8&#13;
&#13;
financed outside of the annual administrative budget cycle. I&#13;
&#13;
tried to bring some order to what was an undefined and&#13;
&#13;
largely unmonitored effort.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Who was doing most of this work when you came on board?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Well, nobody was doing it.     There was no centrally&#13;
&#13;
organized and managed research program before then.       I   don't&#13;
&#13;
mean to say that there was no research          certainly there&#13;
&#13;
was.    A lot of people were doing research, but there was no&#13;
&#13;
oversight and no research program with objectives and&#13;
&#13;
resources allocated to agreed priorities. We also tried to&#13;
&#13;
strengthen the link to publication of results and to improve&#13;
&#13;
dissemination.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Does this also coincide with an attempt to step up the&#13;
&#13;
Bank's external research activities?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     was Chenery pushing this expansion?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Well, Hollis was very interested in economic research,&#13;
&#13;
but his conception of this was really quite different from&#13;
&#13;
what the Bank had been doing.       He wanted to explore patterns&#13;
&#13;
of development; cross-country regression analyses. He was&#13;
&#13;
interested in broad policy issues; he attached importance to&#13;
&#13;
quantitative methods and modelling. Much of the Bank's work&#13;
&#13;
before that, was focused on operationally-connected research&#13;
&#13;
including primary commodity prices. Hollis wanted to explore&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (12/29/94), Page 9&#13;
&#13;
broader patterns of development; his priorities guided the&#13;
&#13;
Bank's large-scale research activities during his tenure.&#13;
&#13;
     Hollis recruited a large group of capable researchers,&#13;
&#13;
with a strong quantitative capacity. He established -- the&#13;
&#13;
Development Research Center as an independent unit and it&#13;
&#13;
produced some notable work. The research also supported some&#13;
&#13;
of the books Hollis authored or co-authored. He sought to&#13;
&#13;
involve outside researchers and research institutions. He&#13;
&#13;
also established the Policy.Department (later managed by&#13;
&#13;
Mahbub ul-Haq), which became very active also on public&#13;
&#13;
policy, including poverty issues.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Day to day management?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Hollis was not very interested in managerial issues. He&#13;
&#13;
was a man with great policy sense. He contributed innovative&#13;
&#13;
methods of analyzing developing countries; he continued to&#13;
&#13;
see himself as a principal researcher and the President's&#13;
&#13;
economic policy advisor.   Hollis was more involved in actual&#13;
&#13;
research projects than his successors.&#13;
&#13;
     As for me, I   had a rapid change of titles and&#13;
&#13;
responsibilities, but essentially, I became Hollis' chief&#13;
&#13;
operating officer. I helped him run the Development Policy&#13;
&#13;
Staff (DPS) which consisted of four or five departments.&#13;
&#13;
After I left, Mr. Karaosmanoglu (who also became a Managing&#13;
&#13;
Director) took mv place.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (12/29/94), Page 10&#13;
&#13;
Q:   When you came to the Bank, you were familiar with the&#13;
&#13;
development economics literature, then you had an awful lot&#13;
&#13;
of practical experience with the development process. At this&#13;
&#13;
point, when you were put in charge of DPS, did you have to&#13;
&#13;
get back up to speed in the field of developmental economics?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I was not in charge of DPS; Hollis Chenery was.    But, if&#13;
&#13;
I had wanted to be part of the research effort, I would&#13;
&#13;
undoubtedly have had to strengthen my background in&#13;
&#13;
development economics. However, it was generally recognized&#13;
&#13;
that research wasn't my forte. Nor was it what I wanted to&#13;
&#13;
do. DPS was an initial home. By the time I had become&#13;
&#13;
Director of Development Policy, my responsibilities were&#13;
&#13;
broader than the administrative side of the research program.&#13;
&#13;
Hollis always viewed me as a person who could translate&#13;
&#13;
.economic concepts to policy makers and other audiences, and&#13;
&#13;
that's how he used me increasingly.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So you are now, in effect, administering an operation&#13;
&#13;
that involves a certain body of ideas which was influenced by&#13;
&#13;
a big professional community outside the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes,   that is a good description; except I was helping to&#13;
&#13;
administer. But it wasn't such a big outside community in&#13;
&#13;
those days. Development economics was not integrated into the&#13;
&#13;
economic mainstream. There were groups at Harvard and&#13;
&#13;
Williams; the Food Research Institute at Stanford, and the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (12/29/94), Page 11&#13;
&#13;
Growth Center at Yale. In the U.K. there was an important&#13;
&#13;
group at Sussex. Other universitiesâ&#128;¢ groups were small. And&#13;
&#13;
then there were economists in other development agencies. I&#13;
&#13;
knew many of the people in those places from my time at AID.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So it didn't take you much time to get up to speed in&#13;
&#13;
this field?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No, although I never was or could claim to be, the equal&#13;
&#13;
of the quantitative economists at the Development Research&#13;
&#13;
Center. But I don't think I ever lost contact with the&#13;
&#13;
majority of the thinkers in the field.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did you feel that McNamara wanted to use economics and&#13;
&#13;
economic analysis in a new way in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I   think the answer is yes.   Certainly McNamara hired&#13;
&#13;
Chenery because he wanted the Bank's analyses to be global in&#13;
&#13;
scope. He wasn't interested so much in doing better country&#13;
&#13;
economic reports -- although we certainly worked on that,      too&#13;
&#13;
-- as in the cross-country analysis of development patterns&#13;
&#13;
which could identify problems that the Bank could focus on&#13;
&#13;
operationally. This was grist for McNamara's mill, it&#13;
&#13;
illuminated new policy issues. What are the things the Bank&#13;
&#13;
ought to be focusing on?    What are the things he could put&#13;
&#13;
before the international community?    What were the strategic&#13;
&#13;
issues that the Bank ought to think about?&#13;
&#13;
     McNamara certainly had a much different view of the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     Stern (12/29/94), Page 12&#13;
&#13;
President's role than his predecessors. His predecessors were&#13;
&#13;
not people who spoke out frequently on the broad issues of&#13;
&#13;
development.   It wasn't until McNamara came along that&#13;
&#13;
population, education, human resources, agriculture, rural&#13;
&#13;
development and income distribution emerged as development&#13;
&#13;
policy foci. Cheneryâ&#128;¢s work had a lot to do with this.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Now, when you come on board, that's already churning&#13;
&#13;
around.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.   That certainly had started.   I came in the&#13;
&#13;
beginning of '72.   McNamara had been in the Bank over three&#13;
&#13;
years. Some of his rethinking about the role of the Bank had&#13;
&#13;
led to the reorganization of 1972.&#13;
&#13;
     The reorganization's aim was to strengthen the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
country focus and reduce its technical proj ec.t focus.&#13;
&#13;
McNamara wanted to break the technician's hold over the&#13;
&#13;
Bank's operations. He wanted the staff to look at the&#13;
&#13;
individual country and its problems in the major policy&#13;
&#13;
areas. All of this became increasingly articulated over time&#13;
&#13;
up until the present day, but certainly the '72&#13;
&#13;
reorganization marked the beginning of that process.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Do you remember your first presentation to McNamara?&#13;
&#13;
What was that first encounter like? How did he evaluate you?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Oh, I don't know that it ever worked like that.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Well, just tell me how it worked then.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (12/29/94), Page 13&#13;
&#13;
A:      I first met McNamara shortly after I arrived at the&#13;
&#13;
Bank.     Hollis asked me to write a memo on the status of the&#13;
&#13;
u.s.    aid program and he passed along to Bob. My first meeting&#13;
&#13;
with Bob was a discussion of that memo. I honestly don't have&#13;
&#13;
the foggiest memory of what the substance of the discussion&#13;
&#13;
was.     Often, I would accompany Hollis when he went to see&#13;
&#13;
Bob. The two of us frequently worked on the President's&#13;
&#13;
Annual Meeting speech, which in those days was the results of&#13;
&#13;
a year-long research effort on a major topic. Immediately&#13;
&#13;
after the Annual Meeting, work would start on the next year's&#13;
&#13;
speech.&#13;
&#13;
        I was usually engaged in the broader policy issues of&#13;
&#13;
whatever the Bank was doing at the time.     Hollis and I&#13;
&#13;
divided things up. He was much better equipped than I to deal&#13;
&#13;
with the research content, the methodology and the quality of&#13;
&#13;
economic analysis. And his interests were largely on macro&#13;
&#13;
issues of growth and income distribution. I helped to apply&#13;
&#13;
the. results of research to specific policy areas and to&#13;
&#13;
manage the economics and policy staffs.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      What were your early impressions of McNamara as a&#13;
&#13;
manager? How was his style different from other&#13;
&#13;
administrators that you had seen?&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Bob certainly was different. I had never seen anybody&#13;
&#13;
quite like him before, but he and I got along very well from&#13;
&amp;#12;                                    Stern (12/29/94), Page 14&#13;
&#13;
the beginning. For many years, I couldn't understand why&#13;
&#13;
people were afraid of McNamara. Bob was very assertive, so&#13;
&#13;
you had to hang in there if you didn't think his position was&#13;
&#13;
the correct one. But Bob didn't mind disagreement. He could&#13;
&#13;
spend an hour arguing with you if you still had something&#13;
&#13;
left to say. He didn't like going around in circles. He&#13;
&#13;
wanted to reach conclusions efficiently, but I never found&#13;
&#13;
him unwilling to discuss a topic or not be open to new ideas&#13;
&#13;
or different points of view.&#13;
&#13;
     But to answer your question, I found his management&#13;
&#13;
style very different from what I had experienced before. He&#13;
&#13;
had an incredible capacity for work; boundless energy; and&#13;
&#13;
the capability of absorbing and using an immense amount of&#13;
&#13;
information. His attention to detail was incredible.   He&#13;
&#13;
worried about which way the charts ought to be printed, and&#13;
&#13;
he specified the format for the budget presentation right&#13;
&#13;
down to the shape of the margins because the presentation of&#13;
&#13;
facts mattered to him. They determined whether the audience&#13;
&#13;
would understand the points he wished to convey.&#13;
&#13;
     McNamara's tables were the best that I had seen, but&#13;
&#13;
still, I don't think that many other senior officers have the&#13;
&#13;
time, the capacity or the interest to do this themselves.      He&#13;
&#13;
was certainly an overwhelming manager.   He really wanted to&#13;
&#13;
know every detail of everything; yet if he trusted you, he&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (12/29/94), Page 15&#13;
left you pretty much alone to decide matters.       He wanted to&#13;
&#13;
know what was going on, but I never found him overbearing.&#13;
&#13;
       McNamara's style was comprehensive. I can remember being&#13;
&#13;
in his office at budget time, and he was worrying about&#13;
&#13;
whether somebody was going to get an extra secretary or not.&#13;
&#13;
That's not something I would do. I thought that this was a&#13;
&#13;
waste of his capacity.     McNamara had a great sense of&#13;
&#13;
accountability and transparency. He wanted to be sure that&#13;
&#13;
the Board knew everything.     He didn't want to hold anything&#13;
&#13;
back. In order to do that, he felt that he had to exercise&#13;
&#13;
detailed control and be conversant with every aspect of the&#13;
&#13;
institution. The budget office was an important instrument of&#13;
&#13;
that control.&#13;
&#13;
       Of course, McNamara had inherited many people who knew&#13;
&#13;
little about management        that remains true in the Bank&#13;
&#13;
today. The Bank is full of intellectuals. They don't pay much&#13;
&#13;
attention to managing people, managing resources, or being&#13;
&#13;
cost conscious. These things came naturally to McNamara,&#13;
&#13;
however, and management had been important to him throughout&#13;
&#13;
his career.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     And to you?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Not to the same extent, but to me as well.     I'm sure&#13;
&#13;
McNamara must have felt that if he wasn't in control during&#13;
&#13;
this   per"-~   -f ve=Y rapid expansion then costs and staff&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (12/29/94), Page 16&#13;
&#13;
would escalate at a rate which he couldn't defend. Looking&#13;
&#13;
back, nobody in the Board would have given him a hard time.&#13;
&#13;
He had no equal in his knowledge of the institution.&#13;
&#13;
Nevertheless, he felt it was his responsibility to justify&#13;
&#13;
his budgets very clearly; to be sure the shareholders shared&#13;
&#13;
his strategy.&#13;
&#13;
     He read every project.     In a Board discussion, he knew&#13;
&#13;
(a) where the problems were in the project, and (b) the&#13;
&#13;
answers to the questions.     If the staff gave the wrong answer&#13;
&#13;
McNamara would give the right answer.     Since McNamara, there&#13;
&#13;
hasn't been a President who's read all project proposals.&#13;
&#13;
     McNamara had a capacity for work which I have not seen&#13;
&#13;
equalled. He was exceptional in managing his time. He could&#13;
&#13;
work very efficiently for hours on end. Part of his global&#13;
&#13;
outlook came from an immense number of outside-the-Bank&#13;
&#13;
contacts;   he certainly wasn't dependent on the Bank for all&#13;
&#13;
his intellectual stimulation. He had many contacts including&#13;
&#13;
the. Ford Foundation staff, numerous government officials,&#13;
&#13;
development practitioners and academics. McNamara traveled a&#13;
&#13;
lot, and he absorbed a lot of what he saw. He had many&#13;
&#13;
sources of information that helped shape his outlook.&#13;
&#13;
Furthermore, McNamara's experience in the Defense Department&#13;
&#13;
also helped to shape   his global framework. At DOD, the&#13;
&#13;
developing countries were an important part of his strategic&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (12/29/94), Page 17&#13;
thinking. Obviously not all the LDC's played a large role,&#13;
&#13;
but his understanding of countries such as Turkey and&#13;
&#13;
Pakistan showed that he viewed the world as an integrated&#13;
&#13;
unit.&#13;
&#13;
        In many ways, McNamara seemed paradoxical to people&#13;
&#13;
He had a tremendous capacity for detail, yet he had this&#13;
&#13;
comprehensive global view of current and future issues.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Was there any tension inherent in this regard?&#13;
&#13;
A:      No.   I also believe that you can't be a cosmologist&#13;
&#13;
without knowing the building blocks. Bob knew the building&#13;
&#13;
blocks very well. His policy initiatives were based on as&#13;
&#13;
much detailed knowledge and practical experience as possible.&#13;
&#13;
He knew the ins and outs of his organization. He was an&#13;
&#13;
extremely capable President.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      How would you characterize your own management style?&#13;
&#13;
A:      I'm certainly a hands-on manager.   I like to know how&#13;
&#13;
people get to their conclusions.      I like to know what they&#13;
&#13;
do..    I tend to be very much concerned with quality issues and&#13;
&#13;
professional integrity issues.      I'm not a great extrovert.     I&#13;
&#13;
tend to lean toward more formal communication rather than&#13;
&#13;
glad-handing and walking the halls.      I think I have nurtured&#13;
&#13;
a lot of people.     Even though I'm hands-on, I try never to&#13;
&#13;
take credit for the accomplishments of others. I know people&#13;
&#13;
tend to see a conflict between hands-on management and&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     Stern (12/29/94), Page 18&#13;
&#13;
delegation, but I don't see that myself. I'm not very hands-&#13;
&#13;
on in my relationships with people who produce high quality&#13;
&#13;
work. I don't have to worry about them. However, I do worry&#13;
&#13;
about those who haven't demonstrated that they are on top of&#13;
&#13;
their responsibilities and in those cases I get more&#13;
&#13;
personally involved till I know the subject is well in hand.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   When you came into the Bank, it was certainly a much&#13;
&#13;
more flexible organization than what you had been used to.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes,Â· that's true. There were fewer constraints.   The&#13;
&#13;
Bank is much more flexible than a US Government agency. It is&#13;
&#13;
smaller so the application of rules can be more nuanced and&#13;
&#13;
flexible. It is responsible to its shareholders, represented&#13;
&#13;
in the Board.   They are here full time and know the&#13;
&#13;
institution which is important in setting policy. When change&#13;
&#13;
is necessary you are dealing with knowledgeable people. In&#13;
&#13;
addition, the Bank's staff is much more diverse than in the&#13;
&#13;
Government and this requires flexibility. At the Bank, the&#13;
&#13;
bottom line is more within your own control. We make a profit&#13;
&#13;
and pay for our administrative expenses. We are explicitly&#13;
&#13;
barred from dealing with political issues. All this makes for&#13;
&#13;
flexibility and professional integrity.&#13;
&#13;
     This more flexible environment makes it easier for the&#13;
&#13;
Bank to experiment with different things.   If you want to&#13;
&#13;
expand a research program and the President endorses the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (i2/29/94), Page 19&#13;
&#13;
proposal this can be implemented with relatively few hassles.&#13;
&#13;
The high quality of the Bank staff also encourages&#13;
&#13;
experimentation. There were certainly very bright people at&#13;
&#13;
AID, but by the early '70s a lot of them had left. Meanwhile,&#13;
&#13;
the Bank focused on hiring the brightest people available. It&#13;
&#13;
was a very attractive organization to people who were&#13;
&#13;
interested in either development economics or development&#13;
&#13;
generally.    The Bank was the premier place to work, and&#13;
&#13;
therefore, i t had a large talent pool to draw from. The&#13;
&#13;
average quality of staff was much higher in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
     But while it was a more flexible environment, one in&#13;
&#13;
which decisions could be reached fairly quickly, the Bank, at&#13;
&#13;
least when I first arrived, was still at the cusp of a&#13;
&#13;
transition.    It was still very hierarchical; in a sense more&#13;
&#13;
so than AID. You still had many old-timers who had been in&#13;
&#13;
the Bank a long time and who embodied great emphasis on&#13;
&#13;
technical quality and prudence. They were conservative,&#13;
&#13;
infuential and cautious about changes including the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
entry into new areas of development. Relationships with them&#13;
&#13;
were not as casual as the relationships in the Bank today.&#13;
&#13;
There was more discipline. Certainly before McNamara arrived,&#13;
&#13;
there was a strong British hierarchical current running&#13;
&#13;
through the Bank's organizational culture. It was a British&#13;
&#13;
colonial cultu're leavened by a group of Dutchmen, who were&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (12/29/94), Page 20&#13;
also quite rigid. It was a mixture in those days for sure.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Let me stop you right there.     If you are right on that&#13;
&#13;
point, then in your early days, the Bank's organizational&#13;
&#13;
culture was actually a mixture of subcultures. The old guard&#13;
&#13;
maintained an engineering orientation toward projects, while&#13;
&#13;
the new wave of personnel tended to have a broader&#13;
&#13;
orientation. Would you agree?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes. In those days, you had the people that McNamara&#13;
&#13;
brought in, and you had the pre-McNamara people who were&#13;
&#13;
heavily grounded in project work and who occupied a number of&#13;
&#13;
the senior management positions. McNamara brought in very few&#13;
&#13;
senior management people. Hollis Chenery was a notable&#13;
&#13;
exception, however.     Hollis, in turn, brought in a number of&#13;
&#13;
new people into the Bank, but that was essentially&#13;
&#13;
economists, not managers. However, they did contribute some&#13;
&#13;
ferment. The reorganization also moved younger people into&#13;
&#13;
management positions in the Country Departments and the&#13;
&#13;
regional offices.     As a result, you had a kind of a&#13;
&#13;
revolution of sorts as the Bank shifted from a pure project&#13;
&#13;
focus to broader sectoral issues in agriculture, education&#13;
&#13;
and health care, and economy-wide issues such as population&#13;
&#13;
growth and income distribution. There was tension during this&#13;
&#13;
period in both the economics and operations complexes about&#13;
&#13;
the transition. I didn't know the old-timers at the senior&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     Stern (12/29/94), Page 21&#13;
&#13;
level very well, but I don't believe that people like Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Aldewereld, Warren Baum, Burke Knapp, Dick DeMuth, Aaron&#13;
&#13;
Broches or Bernard Chadenet viewed Robet McNamara as an&#13;
&#13;
undiluted good.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Right.   They had a different ideology.&#13;
&#13;
A:   I don't know whether ideology is the right word;&#13;
&#13;
probably they had a different vision of the role of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
and its capacity. These tensions continued for a long time.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How did you manage that tension in your own operations?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Basically there was not much to be done about it. I was&#13;
&#13;
in any event seen as a brash outsider. I just rode it out and&#13;
&#13;
focused on the things that I wanted to accomplish. They were&#13;
&#13;
entitled to their opinions.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   During this transition, did you hone in on certain areas&#13;
&#13;
or people that you really depended on?   Can you remember any&#13;
&#13;
one in particular?&#13;
&#13;
A:   It's hard to say.   I don't think it worked that way.    I&#13;
&#13;
gravitated naturally to the policy side of things, and there&#13;
&#13;
were regions where that was more interesting.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What were some of them?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Latin America was not one of those, and it was quite&#13;
&#13;
cliquish so I was not much involved there. However, I did&#13;
&#13;
take a   keen interest in EMENA, and in Asia, particularly&#13;
&#13;
South Asia -- areas in which I had personal experience and&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     Stern (12/29/94), Page 22&#13;
&#13;
Africa. In South Asia, I knew the Vice President, Peter&#13;
&#13;
Cargill. He too was an old-timer, but a very relaxed one.&#13;
&#13;
Peter was an old line British ICS officer. He had lots of&#13;
&#13;
experience, and we became good friends. I learned a lot from&#13;
&#13;
him about people, the Bank, and South Asia.   Within the&#13;
&#13;
economics complex I worked with the staff on communication&#13;
&#13;
and dissemination to non-economists. I worked quite closely&#13;
&#13;
with the Development Policy Department which was under Mahbub&#13;
&#13;
ul-Haq. At the outset, I had great difficulty with two&#13;
&#13;
Britishers who ran the two economics departments in DPS,&#13;
&#13;
David Henderson and Phillip Hayes.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What sort of difficulty?&#13;
&#13;
A:   They neither understood nor liked my position and&#13;
&#13;
responsibilities. They didn't accept my right to review&#13;
&#13;
anything they had done. Eventually, they left.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Don't get me wrong.   I didn't push them out. They&#13;
&#13;
eventually found the Bank and the changes taking place&#13;
&#13;
uncongenial.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   To make this kind of transition, certain changes have to&#13;
&#13;
take place, usually in the middle levels within management.&#13;
&#13;
A:   I worked with Henderson and Hayesâ&#128;¢ replacements very&#13;
&#13;
well. Wouter Tims replaced Phillip Hayes, and Helen Hughes,&#13;
&#13;
an Australian, replaced David Henderson. I had good&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (12/29/94), Page 23&#13;
relationships with both.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   At this point, to what extent were you getting involved&#13;
&#13;
in the operational side?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, quite a lot because,   (a) I liked operations as&#13;
&#13;
distinguished from the more abstract economic anaysis, and&#13;
&#13;
(b) because I was, by definition, a link between the&#13;
&#13;
economics and operations complexes.   Although I had never&#13;
&#13;
done project appraisal missions - the hallmark of an&#13;
&#13;
operations officer in the Bank - I had field experience and I&#13;
&#13;
could communicate well with both the economists and the&#13;
&#13;
operations people. I got along well with the regional chief&#13;
&#13;
economists which was important, because they were the&#13;
&#13;
regional counterparts to the central economic staff. In any&#13;
&#13;
event, my responsibility was not project quality; I focused&#13;
&#13;
on country economic reports, the country strategies, and the&#13;
&#13;
reviews of the regional programs. I helped Hollis to evaluate&#13;
&#13;
this material in light of our policy framework and global&#13;
&#13;
economic projections. Quite often, I was the contact point&#13;
&#13;
with the Regions.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You were carrying ideas from economists in the planning&#13;
&#13;
part of the operation to the people in the field. You were&#13;
&#13;
transmitting those ideas.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes, but it also was a two-way street. We helped to&#13;
&#13;
shift the focus of the economic work to the Bank's areas of&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              Stern (12/29/94), Page 24&#13;
&#13;
    policy priority and provided the global economic framework to&#13;
&#13;
    assess feasibility. In short, we performed reality checks on&#13;
&#13;
    Regional programs. But we also fed back from the Regions to&#13;
&#13;
    the economic staffs the issues of concern to them.&#13;
&#13;
            Quite a lot of policy papers were done by DPS. They&#13;
&#13;
    weren't done in isolation. Most of them were joint efforts&#13;
&#13;
    with Operations and certainly there were always reviews with&#13;
&#13;
    the Operations staffs of the policy papers.&#13;
&#13;
    Q:      Nevertheless, economics was taking the position that&#13;
&#13;
    e~gineering     had previously held at the Bank. Is that true?&#13;
&#13;
    A:      There's no doubt that part of the McNamara revolution&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   was gradually replacing the central authority of project-&#13;
&#13;
    based engineering type staff (including economists who were&#13;
&#13;
    project economists) with the macroeconomists.        No doubt about&#13;
&#13;
    that.&#13;
&#13;
    Q:      I   just wanted to get a sense of how hierarchical it was.&#13;
&#13;
    Were things flowing down more often than things were flowing&#13;
&#13;
    up from the field.&#13;
&#13;
    A:      Even then, it was a big place, so you had lots of cross-&#13;
&#13;
    flows and people talking to each other.&#13;
&#13;
    Q:      Could you tell us a little bit about the Development&#13;
&#13;
    Committee?&#13;
&#13;
    A:      You don't want to know a lot about this.&#13;
&#13;
    Q:      Yes.    Yes.   We want to know a little bit about it.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (12/29/94) , Page 25&#13;
&#13;
A:   What do you want to know?    The Development Committee has&#13;
&#13;
been a symbol for as long as it has existed -- about 20 years&#13;
&#13;
or so. It grew out of the reform of the IMF, the amendment of&#13;
&#13;
the IMF Articles of Agreement.    Towards the end of the&#13;
&#13;
process, they discovered that few, if any, of the proposed&#13;
&#13;
amendments dealt with issues of concern to the developing&#13;
&#13;
countries. There were three committees dealing with&#13;
&#13;
amendments to the IMF Articles and so, toward the end of the&#13;
&#13;
process, a fourth committee was established - the Committee&#13;
&#13;
on the Transfer of Real Resources -- which is the formal name&#13;
&#13;
of the Development Committee.    Since it was much too late to&#13;
&#13;
affect the drafting of the amendments, it was agreed to keep&#13;
&#13;
the Committee alive, as a permanent body, even after the Fund&#13;
&#13;
Articles had been amended. That was the origin of the&#13;
&#13;
Development Committee which became a permanent Committee of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank and the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
     Since the scope of interests, judging by its title, was&#13;
&#13;
very large, and since the developing countries had gotten&#13;
&#13;
little else out of the amendments, they wanted the&#13;
&#13;
Development Committee to be a major force. It started on a&#13;
&#13;
grand scale with an Executive Secretary and three Deputy&#13;
&#13;
Executive Secretaries. Since I was in the Development Policy&#13;
&#13;
Staff at the time, I was their contact on the Bank side.&#13;
&#13;
     Unfortunately, the Committee never had much of a&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     Stern (12/29/94), Page 26&#13;
&#13;
practical purpose, and its role has eroded steadily over the&#13;
&#13;
last 20 years. It now has no staff of its own, and the&#13;
&#13;
position of Executive Secretary was abolished recently. Mr.&#13;
&#13;
McNamara and I once tried to eliminate the Committee at its&#13;
&#13;
meeting, in Jamaica.   We came close, but the Committee had&#13;
&#13;
become such a symbol that the developing countries saw its&#13;
&#13;
elimination as an expression of disinterest by the&#13;
&#13;
international community in their problems - although the&#13;
&#13;
Committee had done nothing - and consequently some of the&#13;
&#13;
OECD countries did not want to incur the political liability&#13;
&#13;
of closing down the Committee, even though they agreed with&#13;
&#13;
our substantive assessment. Even the minimal objective of the&#13;
&#13;
developing countries -- providing a forum for the Finance&#13;
&#13;
Ministers to meet and discuss development issues -- was not&#13;
&#13;
achieved.   It was a nice thought, but nobody can make the&#13;
&#13;
Finance Ministers come to where they don't want to go.&#13;
&#13;
And they did not want to go to the Development Committee&#13;
&#13;
meetings because the subjects were not very operational; the&#13;
&#13;
discussion general; and the Committee explicitly not a&#13;
&#13;
decision-making body. Attendance from the outset was spotty,&#13;
&#13;
it has become increasingly spottier. The Finance Ministers&#13;
&#13;
tend to give their speeches and depart, leaving civil&#13;
&#13;
servants in their places. Nevertheless, the developing&#13;
&#13;
countries and some of the Part I countries,   (France and&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (12/29/94), Page 27&#13;
&#13;
others) never had the political will to say, "This does not&#13;
&#13;
work. Let us abolish it."    Instead, they spent endless hours&#13;
&#13;
in futile attempts to reform the Committee.&#13;
&#13;
     The Executive Directors of the Bank and the Fund always&#13;
&#13;
were afraid that the Development Committee, which consisted&#13;
&#13;
of Governors, would usurp their responsibilities or reduce&#13;
&#13;
their degrees of freedom. Consequently, the Boards exercised&#13;
&#13;
increasing control over the papers that went to the&#13;
&#13;
Development Committee as the independent Secretariat shrank&#13;
&#13;
in size. By now, virtually all papers are prepared by Bank&#13;
&#13;
and Fund staff and are discussed with the Boards before being&#13;
&#13;
submitted to the Development Committee. By definition,&#13;
&#13;
nothing that the Boards would not approve gets to the&#13;
&#13;
Development Committee for consideration; but if the Boards&#13;
&#13;
would approve what is the Committee's function?&#13;
&#13;
     In the early days,   (mid 70's), we used the Development&#13;
&#13;
Committee to help set up the Third Window. This was another&#13;
&#13;
of my sidelines. It was an effort to provide financing on&#13;
&#13;
terms between the Bank and IDA. The Development Committee's&#13;
&#13;
Executive Secretary, Muzaffer Ahmed, was very fond of the&#13;
&#13;
Third Window. It was an idea which had been promoted&#13;
&#13;
originally by the Governor of the Central Bank of Israel, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Horowitz, in the mid-50's.   Nobody has ever been able to&#13;
&#13;
figure out how the Horowitz plan could be made to work --&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     Stern (12/29/94), Page 28&#13;
&#13;
because in most circumstances it is a costly way to provide&#13;
&#13;
concessional money -- but it always remained a seductive&#13;
&#13;
idea. In this case, the proposal was to subsidize the&#13;
&#13;
interest charged by the World Bank on its loans (about 8% at&#13;
&#13;
the time I believe) by 4 percentage points.   Countries&#13;
&#13;
adversely affected by the oil price increase would be&#13;
&#13;
eligible. The Bank obviously could not subsidize its own&#13;
&#13;
loans, so the idea was that we would raise grant money from&#13;
&#13;
donors which, if invested, would yield enough income to pay&#13;
&#13;
for the interest rate differential.Â· I've forgotten what year&#13;
&#13;
this was done, but I guess it was shortly after the oil price&#13;
&#13;
increase, and Mr. McNamara felt strongly that there would be&#13;
&#13;
a great need for more concessional assistance.   This was one&#13;
&#13;
way to try to help. The Development Committee put its&#13;
&#13;
imprimatur on the proposal which helped with the fund&#13;
&#13;
raising. Nonetheless, it was not a great success;   it was&#13;
&#13;
hard to get the money. I believe I raised only about $120&#13;
&#13;
million and relatively few Third Window loans were made.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So the Development Committee represents a continuing&#13;
&#13;
tension between the debtors and the creditors?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, there was always a tension between the Board and&#13;
&#13;
the concept of this Committee.   There was always a question&#13;
&#13;
of whether the Committee should be a decision-making body or&#13;
&#13;
an advisory body.   There was always tension between those&#13;
&amp;#12;                                    Stern (12/29/94), Page 29&#13;
&#13;
countries who wanted the Committee to take a position on all&#13;
&#13;
global issues and those who wanted it to stay focussed on&#13;
&#13;
issues relating to the Bank. In the early days, the agenda&#13;
&#13;
was full of all kinds of items which the Bank had very little&#13;
&#13;
interest in, or could do very little about.   There always was&#13;
&#13;
some tension between the Bank and the Fund content of the&#13;
&#13;
agenda. In theory, the Committee is a joint Committee of&#13;
&#13;
institutions, yet its purpose was the "transfer of resources"&#13;
&#13;
and the bulk of its agenda has dealt with the development&#13;
&#13;
side. Occasionally, Fund matters come up but the Fund had the&#13;
&#13;
Interim Committee so duplication was usually avoided easily.&#13;
&#13;
And there was, as you say, tension between debtors and&#13;
&#13;
creditors -- between those who wished to expand IDA, the&#13;
&#13;
Bank's capital and lending, and those who wished to proceed&#13;
&#13;
more slowly. There always has been great disappointment that&#13;
&#13;
the Committee accomplished so little. But to be fair, if you&#13;
&#13;
look at its structure and its history, you will discover that&#13;
&#13;
it wasn't designed to accomplish anything. It could never&#13;
&#13;
escape the contradictions between the expectations and the&#13;
&#13;
reality.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   While all this is going on, you are absorbing a&#13;
&#13;
reorganization that took place between 1972 and 1975. Could&#13;
&#13;
you talk a little bit about the nature of that reorganization&#13;
&#13;
and how it was working in this period?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     Stern (12/29/94), Page 30&#13;
&#13;
A:   Since I was relatively new when the reorganization&#13;
&#13;
occurred, I was pretty well isolated from it. I knew there&#13;
&#13;
were lots of unhappy people around and that some people had&#13;
&#13;
left, but I hadn't known the Bank before the reorganization,&#13;
&#13;
and did not know many of the people involved closely, so it&#13;
&#13;
really did not make all that much of an impression. I was&#13;
&#13;
comfortable with the organization I found when I arrived. On&#13;
&#13;
the country side, economists prepared the analytic base and&#13;
&#13;
proposed strategies. Country program papers were making their&#13;
&#13;
debut. I was quite familiar with these approaches since they&#13;
&#13;
had been in use at AID for some time. Since I was not&#13;
&#13;
familiar with the Bank's past practices, I didn't realize how&#13;
&#13;
much the structure had changed. I learned this gradually as I&#13;
&#13;
began to talk to people who reminisced about the "good old&#13;
&#13;
times.   11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   TThe 1972 organizational structure was the same basic&#13;
&#13;
structure that McNamara had introduced at Ford. It was&#13;
&#13;
designed to push authority downward. Did that happen?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Modestly.   You need to realize that the effectiveness of&#13;
&#13;
the system depends a great deal on who's in charge of what.&#13;
&#13;
Some of the Vice Presidents exercised a lot of authority in&#13;
&#13;
their Regions in line with agreed policy. But where there was&#13;
&#13;
little adherence to the President's objectives - substantive&#13;
&#13;
or managerial - there were constant frictions with McNamara&#13;
&amp;#12;                                    Stern (12/29/94), Page 31&#13;
&#13;
about what they were doing and why they were doing it. The&#13;
&#13;
battles between McNamara and whoever was heading Latin&#13;
&#13;
America were well known. I'm sure that the people in that&#13;
&#13;
Region felt that they had very little freedom.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Was that a question of personality, or was it a question&#13;
&#13;
of policy?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, I think it was policy reflected in personality.&#13;
&#13;
The Vice President for Latin America, Gerry Alter, had been&#13;
&#13;
there a long time and he had strong opinions.&#13;
&#13;
     Latin America in most organizations that I know always&#13;
&#13;
was a special case; but McNamara was not convinced of this.&#13;
&#13;
Alter was not a great fan of the changes that McNamara was&#13;
&#13;
introducing -- the emphasis on policy and policy performance.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   As the nexus, you were in a very good position to&#13;
&#13;
witness the move toward decentralization.&#13;
&#13;
A:   There was decentralization to the Regions, but keep in&#13;
&#13;
mind that Bob's concept of decentralization may not be the&#13;
&#13;
same as yours or mine. McNamara decentralized, but since he&#13;
&#13;
got into so many things and knew so much about the countries&#13;
&#13;
himself from his own contacts and his travels, he had views&#13;
&#13;
on most things that went on. Therefore, very few people in&#13;
&#13;
the organization felt that they were out there on their own.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Now, have we got you up to about '75?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         Stern (12/29/94), Page 32&#13;
Q:   Let's take it back to the external mood of the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
Nixon's gone off on a plane.     Vietnam is going down the&#13;
&#13;
tubes.   The U.S. is clearly suffering a major defeat. There's&#13;
&#13;
a mood of depression in America. Did these events affect the&#13;
&#13;
Bank at all?&#13;
&#13;
A:   As the Nixon Administration became occupied with other&#13;
&#13;
things, there wasn't much attention paid to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Furthermore, during this   pe~iod,    the Democrats controlled&#13;
&#13;
Congress. McNamara had very good connections on The Hill, so&#13;
&#13;
the funding side wasn't a huge problem.       Don't get me wrong.&#13;
&#13;
It always is a problem, but it was manageable. Bob could (and&#13;
&#13;
did) influence Congressional support.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   McNamara was the point man on that?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes, when it got serious.       He still knew a lot of people&#13;
&#13;
from the Kennedy-Johnson Administrations, both in Congress&#13;
&#13;
and outside. He was a very good friend of the Kennedys. So he&#13;
&#13;
was well wired for dealing with issues which affected the&#13;
&#13;
Bank -- like IDA appropriations or Bank capital increases. On&#13;
&#13;
the substantive side, the Nixon Administration was worrying&#13;
&#13;
so much about Vietnam and the resignation that they didn't&#13;
&#13;
pay much attention to the Bank. I don't think there was much&#13;
&#13;
focus on the Bank under Ford either.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Were you working to coordinate the Bank's activities&#13;
&#13;
more closely with those of the IMF?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (12/29/94), Page 33&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.     The serious coordination efforts with IMF didn't&#13;
&#13;
really start until after the oil crisis and, subsequently,&#13;
&#13;
the debt crisis. However, since all the papers for the&#13;
&#13;
Development Committee had to be done jointly, we did spend&#13;
&#13;
some time working with the Fund before the oil/debt crises.&#13;
&#13;
And, of course, there were contacts at the regional level.&#13;
&#13;
But the relations weren't all that intimate.&#13;
&#13;
     When we started doing the Structural Adjustment Loans,&#13;
&#13;
however, we signed a concordat with the IMF.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Agriculture had one of those with Interior?     Those are&#13;
&#13;
very poorly studied, but they are really important.&#13;
&#13;
A:   We then issued parallel instructions to our staffs about&#13;
&#13;
coordination and respective areas of responsibility. We&#13;
&#13;
didn't visit that topic again until the Conable period.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Were there substantial opportunities for the two&#13;
&#13;
institutions to work together in areas of policy and economic&#13;
&#13;
analysis?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Probably.     On the research side and the data side, there&#13;
&#13;
were many opportunities for collaboration. That's still true&#13;
&#13;
today. Bear in mind, however, that the two institutions have&#13;
&#13;
different institutional perspectives and markedly different&#13;
&#13;
time horizons. The Fund has a very explicit mandate, and we&#13;
&#13;
do not.     Regulating the world's monetary system is quite&#13;
&#13;
explicit. On the other hand, "making the world better" is a&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (12/29/94), Page 34&#13;
&#13;
bit vague. The Fund's programs usually last a few years (more&#13;
&#13;
now with EFF and ESAF), while our loans are for 15 to 20&#13;
&#13;
years, and IDA credits for 35-40.     So the time perspectives&#13;
&#13;
of the two institutions are not very compatible.&#13;
&#13;
     The Fund focuses on aggregates -- total revenue, total&#13;
&#13;
expenditures, tax structure.   Meanwhile, our people worry&#13;
&#13;
about how you dig ditches, the extension services, the&#13;
&#13;
functioning of the social sectors.     It's hard to put the two&#13;
&#13;
together.   When we started with structural adjustment&#13;
&#13;
lending, there were big disputes with the Fund about the&#13;
&#13;
definition of macroeconomic analysis. There was also a lot of&#13;
&#13;
contact with the Fund as we moved into the debt crisis. The&#13;
&#13;
Reagan Administration tried to formalize this relationship&#13;
&#13;
by insisting on the introduction of Policy Framework papers,&#13;
&#13;
prepared jointly by the Fund, Bank and the country concerned&#13;
&#13;
as a condition of ESAF eligibility. The U.S. Treasury also&#13;
&#13;
was very active in promoting collaboration as part of its&#13;
&#13;
program to address the debt crisis.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Through '75, was the U.N. on your scope at all?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Not very much.   We had some dealings with the UNDP; we&#13;
&#13;
had executive agreements with four other UN agencies -- FAO,&#13;
&#13;
UNESCO, UNIDO, and WHO -- but they were essentially&#13;
&#13;
providers of services for Bank operations. On the whole, the&#13;
&#13;
UN was not a big factor in our operations.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                    Stern (12/29/94), Page 35&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Now, in '75 you are going to make another shift.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Can you talk to us a little bit about that decision?&#13;
&#13;
A:    McNamara called me in and asked me to be Vice President&#13;
&#13;
for South Asia. I accepted his offer immediatly.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did you want to return to operational work in this area&#13;
&#13;
of the world?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Definitely. I wanted to get back to operations and, in&#13;
&#13;
AID, I had been very attracted to South Asia.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What were some of the particular problems of settling in&#13;
&#13;
to that job?&#13;
&#13;
A:   It was interesting of course because, here I was,&#13;
&#13;
entering into an unfamiliar part of the Bank -- dealing with&#13;
&#13;
individual operations, assessing our participation in&#13;
&#13;
projects; supervising a large technical department, and&#13;
&#13;
getting much more into country priorities, policies and&#13;
&#13;
economic management problems rather than global strategy&#13;
&#13;
issues. I also had to deal with a group of people whom I&#13;
&#13;
didn't know very well.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Earlier, you gave us a picture of what the state of the&#13;
&#13;
organization was when you first came to the Bank. What about&#13;
&#13;
in this case? What was the state of the organization?&#13;
&#13;
A:   This was three years after the reorganization. Things&#13;
&#13;
had pretty well settled down, so I didn't spend too much time&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (12/29/94), Page 36&#13;
looking at the Regions'   innards. I couldn't have made&#13;
&#13;
drastic changes even if I had wanted to because, at the time,&#13;
&#13;
all the Regions pretty much had the same design.    On the&#13;
&#13;
whole, I had no particular views on the organization's&#13;
&#13;
structure.   It appeared to be a good blend between people who&#13;
&#13;
specialized in country relations -- management of the country&#13;
&#13;
relations, the overview of the programs -- and the technical&#13;
&#13;
staff who were responsible for the projects.    There was good&#13;
&#13;
collaboration between project and non-project people.&#13;
&#13;
     South Asia was a more challenging management job than my&#13;
&#13;
position in Hollisâ&#128;¢ department; As Hollis' director, I had&#13;
&#13;
nobody reporting directly to me although I supervised a good&#13;
&#13;
deal of the work. Nonetheless, it was not a line management&#13;
&#13;
function. In South Asia, I was a line manager with a large&#13;
&#13;
program for which I was clearly accountable as well as the&#13;
&#13;
management of a lot of people. That was certainly different.&#13;
&#13;
     Looking back, I believe that I tried to tighten up the&#13;
&#13;
decision-making process. It was the time when we ended&#13;
&#13;
industrial import loans to India.    They had been a hallmark&#13;
&#13;
of our relationship with that country. In my opinion, they&#13;
&#13;
were a very unsatisfactory concept       they provided a lot of&#13;
&#13;
quick disbursing funds and had little development impact.&#13;
&#13;
Nevertheless, it had been seen as a central aspect of our&#13;
&#13;
relationship and ending it proved contentious. Yet we did end&#13;
&amp;#12;                                    Stern (12/29/94), Page 37&#13;
this type of lending and the relationship survived.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Earlier, we mentioned that Structural Adjustment Loans&#13;
&#13;
made their appearance around this time. Did you think that&#13;
&#13;
they would become a major tool of the Bank in terms of&#13;
&#13;
influence?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No - Structural Adjustment Loans came later - after I&#13;
&#13;
haq already left South Asia. In those days, I still believed&#13;
&#13;
that the Bank was best at project financing. However, we&#13;
&#13;
began to struggle with the problem of how we could have a&#13;
&#13;
more effective role in dealing with sectoral and&#13;
&#13;
institutional policy issues which impeded project&#13;
&#13;
implementation and sustainability. And eventually, that's&#13;
&#13;
where the SAL concept came from. The SAL's got the Bank a&#13;
&#13;
seat at the table for major policy issues -- macro policy&#13;
&#13;
issues as well as sectoral issues. It became increasingly&#13;
&#13;
clear that individual projects -- no matter how well designed&#13;
&#13;
and implemented -- were not going to solve the longer-term&#13;
&#13;
problems of development.&#13;
&#13;
     Later, we tried a somewhat different approach with&#13;
&#13;
Mahbub Ul-Haq who was Finance Minister of Pakistan at the&#13;
&#13;
time. We agreed on a set of sector reforms and priorities for&#13;
&#13;
budget allocations in one operation. Thereafter, the Bank&#13;
&#13;
agreed to make loans in that sector without further sectoral&#13;
&#13;
conditions. These loans moved faster, and they were focused&#13;
&amp;#12;                                    Stern (12/29/94), Page 38&#13;
&#13;
on the technical project content. I think this was a&#13;
&#13;
precursor to what were later called hybrid loans i.e. loans&#13;
&#13;
which in part financed disbursements for imported equipment&#13;
&#13;
and in part project investments.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   At the Regional level, did you have the resources that&#13;
&#13;
you needed to make these policy-based decisions?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, as noted, we did not do adjustment operations when&#13;
&#13;
I was in South Asia. They started when I was already VP for&#13;
&#13;
Operations. But when we first introduced the instrument,&#13;
&#13;
surprisingly, resources did not turn out to be a problem&#13;
&#13;
because we could not find any takersÂ·. It was amazing. It did&#13;
&#13;
turn out later that we didn't have the necessary experience&#13;
&#13;
or data. But our experience was built rapidly.&#13;
&#13;
     I spent three years in fierce arguments with the Board&#13;
&#13;
defending this new tool. The opposition was surprisingly&#13;
&#13;
strong considering how little demand there was originally. A&#13;
&#13;
few countries were -- Kenya and Turkey, for example - but&#13;
&#13;
there wasn't a large demand for this type of instrument.&#13;
&#13;
The fears were many -- that we were duplicating the work of&#13;
&#13;
the Fund (we were not); that we had no legal mandate (we&#13;
&#13;
did); that we had no experienced staff (true, but remediable&#13;
&#13;
through recruitment).&#13;
&#13;
Q:   In the '75-'78 period, what programs enjoyed the most&#13;
&#13;
success, and where were the biggest problems?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     Stern (12/29/94), Page 39&#13;
&#13;
A:   I would like to avoid sweeping generalizations.     The&#13;
&#13;
success rates of our projects did not vary dramatically by&#13;
&#13;
sector. We did move out of the tourism sector because it was&#13;
&#13;
high cost and because the private sector could do it. It was&#13;
&#13;
a period when we were very comfortable with major power&#13;
&#13;
projects, and I think we did some very good ones.   We were&#13;
&#13;
involved in major irrigation activities and, although we knew&#13;
&#13;
that they didn't always pan out, I think that we made good&#13;
&#13;
progress in that area as well.   We also focused on what,&#13;
&#13;
later on, became a much more articulated basic needs/poverty&#13;
&#13;
alleviation strategy. In that period, I think the Bank felt&#13;
&#13;
very comfortable with itself and with what it was doing. It&#13;
&#13;
was making contributions to growth, development, and&#13;
&#13;
institution building. On the downside, the Bank did tend to&#13;
&#13;
underestimate institutional problems in the developing&#13;
&#13;
countries. It could have paid more attention to management&#13;
&#13;
problems, civil service problems, and the technical capacity&#13;
&#13;
of agencies.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Were those problems particularly evident in agriculture,&#13;
&#13;
and education?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Oh, for sure.   They were particularly strong in South&#13;
&#13;
Asia, especially in India where the states had responsibility&#13;
&#13;
for many of these issues. We had a long history of working&#13;
&#13;
with the central government, but we did not enjoy the same&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     Stern (12/29/94), Page 40&#13;
relationship with the lower decision-making levels. We had&#13;
&#13;
the same problem in Pakistan which essentially had the same&#13;
&#13;
governmental structure as India.&#13;
&#13;
     In general, we were better at building institutional&#13;
&#13;
capacity in the hard sectors. It was easy to work with WAPDA,&#13;
&#13;
(Water and Power Authority of Pakistan). There was one&#13;
&#13;
office, and one set of officials. Maintaining continuity was&#13;
&#13;
not difficult. Technical cri.teria were, more or less, common&#13;
&#13;
and understood. Results were readily monitorable. Education&#13;
&#13;
work, small scale irrigation, health, agricultural research,&#13;
&#13;
on the other hand, were much more difficult. They were more&#13;
&#13;
culture and institution specifics; staffs less competent and&#13;
&#13;
institutions weaker; objectives less easily defined; they&#13;
&#13;
were more labor intensive; results less immediate. For&#13;
&#13;
instance, we spent many years supporting integrated rural&#13;
&#13;
development projects without much success - they turned out&#13;
&#13;
to be very inefficient conveyors but it took a long time to&#13;
&#13;
learn that lesson.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How soon did you know that?&#13;
&#13;
A:   They were always difficult, but I don't think that&#13;
&#13;
anybody ever really thought them through. Early on, it became&#13;
&#13;
very evident that these projects were on the wrong track.&#13;
&#13;
They were too dependent on foreign advisors; they were much&#13;
&#13;
too expensive given local income levels; they were, in fact,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (12/29/94), Page 41&#13;
&#13;
not replicable. However, we did not fully grasp the problem,&#13;
&#13;
at least in South Asia, until we got Danny Benor, an Israeli&#13;
&#13;
former Director of Extension into South Asia. He helped&#13;
&#13;
reform     indeed revolutionize -- the extension service in&#13;
&#13;
India in a very productive fashion.&#13;
&#13;
     I remember talking to him for the first time before he&#13;
&#13;
went to India. His approach was truly revolutionary. He&#13;
&#13;
persuaded the Government of one of the states to dispense&#13;
&#13;
with the integrated approach and to focus the extension&#13;
&#13;
agents solely on extension. In order to get operationally&#13;
&#13;
useful information to the farmers, he constructed a very&#13;
&#13;
tightly-controlled management structure. The extension agents&#13;
&#13;
were given a schedule and every village knew exactly what day&#13;
&#13;
the agent was to be there. They thus became the public&#13;
&#13;
supervisor. Every ten days the agents returned for training.&#13;
&#13;
This training was not academic -- it was the message as to&#13;
&#13;
what the farmers ought to do at this point in the crop cycle.&#13;
&#13;
Res.earch similarly was reoriented to the immediate problems&#13;
&#13;
of the farmers. It was very successful -- first in India, and&#13;
&#13;
then in Africa. Once his approach worked its way through the&#13;
&#13;
system, the enthusiasm of the farmers and the extension&#13;
&#13;
agents, as well as the very large production increases, left&#13;
&#13;
little doubt about the ineffectiveness of integrated rural&#13;
&#13;
development projects.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (12/29/94), Page 42&#13;
Q:      Did you come out of this particular phase of '75-'78&#13;
&#13;
with some pretty specific ideas about changes that you wanted&#13;
&#13;
to see?&#13;
&#13;
A:      I thought that the Bank, on the whole,   was soft in its&#13;
&#13;
demands on the borrower and weak in terms of monitoring its&#13;
&#13;
own activities.     Even in the early days, I was struck by how&#13;
&#13;
bad we were at predicting project disbursements over the&#13;
&#13;
implementation period despite many years of experience.&#13;
&#13;
People were basing their estimates on wishes and hopes rather&#13;
&#13;
than past experience. Other aspects of work were very&#13;
&#13;
casually planned, with no clear time schedules. Subsequently,&#13;
&#13;
first as VP of South Asia, and then as Senior VP of&#13;
&#13;
Operations, I tried both to simplify the procedures and to&#13;
&#13;
establish standards for such things as disbursement&#13;
&#13;
estimates, implementation plans, project prep.aration,&#13;
&#13;
schedules and remedial actions on problem projects.&#13;
&#13;
        Some of the current efforts in these areas are more&#13;
&#13;
advanced and more sophisticated, but it was painfully clear&#13;
&#13;
back then that we lacked common indicators of success and&#13;
&#13;
costs. We lacked common bases for judgments. The rating a&#13;
&#13;
project received depended on who went to look at it.     As a&#13;
&#13;
result, the Bank had problems evaluating its own projects.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      What was the reason for this softness on the part of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     Stern (12/29/94), Page 43&#13;
&#13;
A:   We have a lot of people who are very compassionate and&#13;
&#13;
very dedicated to development. And sometimes, they believe&#13;
&#13;
that not holding a borrower to professional standards even&#13;
&#13;
simplified ones, is doing a favor.   Consequently, they have&#13;
&#13;
difficulty insisting on discipline in resource use and on&#13;
&#13;
effective management by the borrower. Compassion often gets&#13;
&#13;
in the way of transferring knowledge, which includes learning&#13;
&#13;
about the importance of discipline and accountability. I&#13;
&#13;
think this paradox is most pronounced in Africa.     Of course,&#13;
&#13;
in South Asia, where India was, far and away, the largest&#13;
&#13;
client, this tension was further attenuated by a long and&#13;
&#13;
very special relationship. The Bank had a long history of&#13;
&#13;
being sensitive to India's concerns. In addition, the&#13;
&#13;
budgetary incentive framework in the Bank was not conducive&#13;
&#13;
to being frank about problem projects, to terminating&#13;
&#13;
processing a project once started, or to linking performance&#13;
&#13;
too closely to judgements about new lending.&#13;
&#13;
     All these things together reinforced a natural tendency&#13;
&#13;
in the Bank to look forward rather than focusing on what is&#13;
&#13;
under implementation, and making sure it works well.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Do you think that the pressure to lend had anything to&#13;
&#13;
do with that?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Certainly the pressure to lend was there.     Although, if&#13;
&#13;
you talked to McNamara about it, he wouldn't say anything&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     Stern (12/29/94), Page 44&#13;
&#13;
very different from what we say today, which is that a Region&#13;
&#13;
is responsible for defining its business plan which, in turn,&#13;
&#13;
is the basis for its budget. And if a Region says it's going&#13;
&#13;
to lend X, and if it has been budgeted to lend X, then it&#13;
&#13;
ought to lend X. I have a lot of sympathy with that.     The&#13;
&#13;
problem, of course, was that the X in those days was highly&#13;
&#13;
influenced by the aggregate lending volume that Mr. McNamara&#13;
&#13;
wanted to achieve. In addition, the budget allocations took&#13;
&#13;
little account of failures in the preceeding year to deliver&#13;
&#13;
on the business plan.&#13;
&#13;
     But the reason I don't think there's much of a&#13;
&#13;
connection, Jochen, is because we stopped that practice more&#13;
&#13;
than 10 years ago -- we have not insisted on, or&#13;
&#13;
predetermined, regional training programs in quite a while.&#13;
&#13;
Yet the same tendencies are still there. The pressure to lend&#13;
&#13;
is not there anymore from the top. In fact, the lending&#13;
&#13;
volume has been flat, and yet, until the Wapenhans Report was&#13;
&#13;
published, all these things I'm talking about --inadequate&#13;
&#13;
supervision, failure to close old projects, excessive&#13;
&#13;
attention to financial aspects rather than development&#13;
&#13;
impact, implementation planning as part of project design&#13;
&#13;
continued. I wouldn't attribute it too readily to lending&#13;
&#13;
pressure.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   waÂ·s the IFC on your scope at all?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     Stern (12/29/94), Page 45&#13;
A:   No.   Not much.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Small?   Too small?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Small in the early days.   They were active in India. But&#13;
&#13;
it was not so much a question of size; there was little&#13;
&#13;
interaction. The public sector, public lending aspects were&#13;
&#13;
quite dominant in those days. Coordination with the IFC&#13;
&#13;
didn't really become a big business until much more recently.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Tell us about the World Development Report of '78?&#13;
&#13;
A;   One day, Mr. McNamara concluded that he wanted the Bank&#13;
&#13;
to publish an equivalent to the Fund's World Economic&#13;
&#13;
Outlook. He called me in and asked me to take on the job. I&#13;
&#13;
did not exactly relish this opportunity because I rather&#13;
&#13;
enjoyed my work in South Asia. I hadn't been there very long&#13;
&#13;
and I was having a good time. Nevertheless, I agreed to Bob's&#13;
&#13;
proposal, gathered a team, and set to work. We had no idea&#13;
&#13;
what the final product should look like and we had a very&#13;
&#13;
short time to do it in, compared to today. Bob, of course,&#13;
&#13;
had ideas. His original concept was to present a general&#13;
&#13;
discusion on the global economy and the role of the&#13;
&#13;
developing countries in that economy, plus a topical issue.&#13;
&#13;
     We also developed a statistical appendix, which was a&#13;
&#13;
monstrous task. Nothing like it had ever been compiled by us.&#13;
&#13;
Bob devoted a lot of attention to the appendix because he&#13;
&#13;
believed that presenting comprehensive data would help to&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     Stern (12/29/94), Page 46&#13;
&#13;
educate the public about developing countries. Despite the&#13;
&#13;
paucity of data on demographic and social factors, he was&#13;
&#13;
adamant about listing all the countries. According to his&#13;
&#13;
view, if we had to leave a lot of blanks, this would&#13;
&#13;
stimulate countries to improve their data and develop the&#13;
&#13;
Bank's interest in collecting it systematically.&#13;
&#13;
     The WDR was intended to lay out the relevance of the&#13;
&#13;
developing countries in the major global activities. What was&#13;
&#13;
the impact of OECD policies and growth to the growth&#13;
&#13;
prospects for developing countries; what was their&#13;
&#13;
significance in global trends?   What was happening to capital&#13;
&#13;
flows and aid? The basic concept has survived and the WDR has&#13;
&#13;
become one of our flagship publications. However, the general&#13;
&#13;
economic' discussion has been dropped so that the focus now is&#13;
&#13;
on an annual special topic. That is, I believe, a mistake.&#13;

            On December 16 and 29, 1994, and January
            5, 1995, Ernest Stern was interviewed on behalf of the World
            Bank Group Archives oral history program by Jochen Kraske,
            Louis Galambos, and David Milobsky. During his tenure at the
            World Bank from 1968 to 1995, Mr. Stern worked in the
            following areas: for the Pearson commission as deputy to the
            executive secretary and staff director (1968-1972); in the
            office of the vice president as senior advisor for
            development policy (1972-1974) and as director (1974-1975);
            as vice president in the South Asia regional office
            (1975-1978) and in operations (1978-1980); as senior vice
            president in operations (1980-1987) and in finance
            (1987-1991); as a member of the policy committee (1987-1991)
            and as managing director (1991-1995). He helped supervise
            the preparation of the landmark first World Development
            Report in 1977. He discusses at length the United States
            International Cooperation Administration (ICA) and its
            subsequent change to the Agency for International
            Development (AID). His transcript also concerns the budget
            office, the staff association, and congressional approval.
