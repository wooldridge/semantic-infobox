&#13;
              ever, have yet been paid, and the South African Government&#13;
              has indicated its desire to include these past orders in the&#13;
&#13;
              loan.    paragraph 9 of the President's memorandum which has&#13;
&#13;
              been circulated to the Board draws attention to certain&#13;
              currency questions connected with the proposed loan, which&#13;

                           I should now like to say a word about the general&#13;
&#13;
              investment programme of the Union.        Since the War a large&#13;
              proportion of the totsl &amp;ee-e investment, both Go,rernment&#13;
                                                                      '&#13;
              and private, has been financed directly or indirectly partly&#13;
&#13;
              rrom the inflow of foreign        capital into South .h.frica and&#13;
&#13;
              partly from the liquidation of South african exchange re-&#13;
              serves. Ttle size of the in,restment progra.m.ne both in the&#13;
&#13;
              public and the private sectors which the Union Government&#13;
              would wish to maintain over the next few years is greater&#13;
              than can be financed rrom local savings and fro!'!! private&#13;
              capital imports from abroad.&#13;
&#13;
                           It is because the Government cannot obtain the&#13;
              necessary    invest~ent   resources by borrowing either at home&#13;
&#13;
              or abroad and because tbey do not wish to run down their&#13;
              foreign exchange reserves that they desire to borrow from&#13;
              the 1nternat1onaJ Bank; so that the contribution of a Bank&#13;
              loan would in fact be that of enabling South Africa to carry&#13;
              out an investment prograrmne at a greater speed and at a&#13;
              higher level tnan would otherwise '00 possible, wbilst&#13;
&#13;
              simultaneously enabling here to maintain her exchange&#13;

&#13;
                          The traditional pattern of the South African&#13;
              balance of payments bas been one of substantial deficits on&#13;

            current account made good b,y an inflow of capital mainly&#13;
&#13;
            from London.       In 1948 this flow came to a temporary halt,&#13;
&#13;
            rna 1nly, it is felt,    bec~oi.use   of pol it leal developments in&#13;
            the Union.     r.rhe rf7sult was that from early in 1948 up to&#13;

&#13;
            holdings of the Reserve .Bank of South Africa suffered a&#13;
            very hÂ·9a.Â·vy decline.        Then, late in 1948, under the pressure&#13;
&#13;
            of this sharp fall in the central Bank's reservss, South&#13;
&#13;
            Africa began to introduce severe restrictions on imports.&#13;
            The effect of these restrictions was slow to appear,&#13;
&#13;
            os pe c i~lly b ec&amp;..u se the sterling imports were only gradu-&#13;
&#13;
            ally brought under control.            However, up to th9 last&#13;
&#13;
            quarter of 1949, owinr, to these restrictions on imports&#13;
&#13;
            and to an increase in the st:erling valuo of gold e.xpol'ts&#13;
&#13;
            which   resulte~    from devaluation, the balance was restored&#13;

&#13;
            and thers was also some official overseas               borrowing,}:~,na&#13;
&#13;
           1be   result b..a.s been that South 1\frica has been able to re-&#13;
&#13;
            coup part of lts previous gold and roreign exchange losses.&#13;
&#13;
                         This balanced current account posit ion of South&#13;
&#13;
           Afr loa cannot be regarded as any thing but a temporary phon-&#13;
            omenon. 'rhere you have a developing economy wittl              subs~antial&#13;
&#13;
            investment needs, and it is likely that South Africa will&#13;
&#13;
            continue to import more than it exports, looking to imports&#13;
            of capital to cover the gap.&#13;
&#13;
                         In appraising the foreign excnange-earnlng&#13;
&#13;
            capacity of South Africa, the future production of gold&#13;
&#13;
            is of paramount importance.            In 1950 it is estir1ated tha.t&#13;

            into production gold production should increase by as much&#13;
&#13;
            as one-third by 1955 to 1960.&#13;
                           As regards the external debt sltuat ion of the&#13;
&#13;
            Union, in 1939 tbe external debt of South Africa. amounted.&#13;
&#13;
            to just over 100 million sterling- wbolly in sterling-&#13;
            but by June, 1949, practically the whole of that external&#13;
&#13;
            debt had been repatriated and the oÂ·utstanding amount had&#13;
&#13;
            been reduced to only 13 million pounds sterling.           Last&#13;
            year arrangements were made 'liitn the UnlteJ. Kingdom au-&#13;

            tborities for the South      Afr~can   Government to raise Â£20million&#13;

            on the London market.       Of that only Â£10 million was in fact&#13;
            issued. That issue was made in November, 1949 an:i that isst.Je&#13;

            loan from the United States Government for too purchase of&#13;
&#13;
            surplus property, of which just under 1~ :nillion dollars&#13;
            remains outstanding.       Apart from this, the Union novernment's&#13;
&#13;
            only foreign borrowings outside the London oarket have been&#13;
            two revolving three-year credits arranged early this year&#13;
            with a group of United States banks and a group of Swiss&#13;
&#13;
            commer c tal banks â&#128;¢ rrhe amounts were 20 mill ion dollars in&#13;
&#13;
            the case of the United States banks and 06 million Swiss francs&#13;
            or roughly 9 million United States dollars in the case of&#13;
            switzerland.&#13;
&#13;
                           The external debt record of   tre   Union shows no&#13;
            default.    Now, despite South Africa's excellent credit&#13;
&#13;
            standin~,      market conjit;ions are such to-l.lay that she would&#13;
&#13;
            have difficulty in obtaining a long-term credit for any&#13;
&#13;
            substantial amount in the l\Iew York market.        We propose to&#13;
&#13;
            continue to look at the prospects of ber securing additional&#13;
&#13;
            sterling financing in the London market.           As we see it, the&#13;
&#13;
            ba.s io risk      inherent in a Bank loan to South Africa is tnis:&#13;
&amp;#12;4&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                    lb&#13;
    STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
              tbat, as I have said, the country will probe.bly for some time&#13;
                                                             f   4'&#13;
                          ( -.â&#128;¢ ~.   ~â&#128;¢. ~.~- ... ,...,.J&gt;&#13;
&#13;
              to come incur a--greater amount . of balance of payments deficits&#13;
                          ~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              which will have to be met by an inflow of foreign capital and&#13;
&#13;
              primarily of private capital.&#13;
                                      We cannot have aqy complete assurance that circum-&#13;
&#13;
              stances may not recur similar to those tl:"la.t stopped the inflow&#13;
&#13;
              of capital in 1948.                                           In those     circumst~nces,     foreign exchange&#13;
              reserves would be oound to st1ow a marked downward tendency,&#13;
&#13;
              and very strict controls on imports and investments would&#13;
&#13;
              probably be necessary to restore the situation.                                                    But we feel&#13;
&#13;
              that a risk of this kind is inherent in the South African&#13;
&#13;
              econom~,               and it seems to us that 1t is a risk which tbe Bank&#13;
&#13;
              can reasonably take.                                          Accordingly we have felt, at staff level,&#13;
&#13;
              able to advise the President that he should recom1end to the&#13;
&#13;
              Board that negotiations be                                           undert~ken         for a loan ror South&#13;

&#13;
        Clit\IH.MaN : Any quest ions?&#13;
        MR. HOPPENO'r:                       There is s omet bin~:-~ that is not â&#128;¢1ery clear to me about&#13;
&#13;
              the fact t;hat the intended application is for 50 million dollars&#13;
&#13;
              or tne equivalent in other currencies.                                                   lt is said somewhere&#13;
              t~t     the hard currency really needed will be only a small amount.&#13;
&#13;
        MR ILIFF:          9 mill ion dollars.&#13;
&#13;
        MR HOPPE!mT:                       Yes.                       Is   it the expectation of the Bank that the&#13;
              d ifferenoe, which is 51 million dollars, Will be .!:a.ctually found&#13;
                                                                                            -tlt_at&#13;

              to be bought against dollars and in that case be&#13;
                                                                                                                 ~&#13;
                                                                                                                -8-f'e~ et;   in&#13;
              dollars by the prospective borrower?                                                    He. ve we any ideas on&#13;
&#13;
              t ba r. po in t ?&#13;
&#13;
       !\~R   IL.lFli':    The question                                    or   currency to be provided under this loan,&#13;
              as I mentioned in the course of my statenent,raises questions&#13;
&#13;
              which we think will have to be considered and very carefully&#13;
&amp;#12;5&#13;
                                               17&#13;
    STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
            cons 1dered during the negot tat ions.            I think some of the&#13;
            considerations involved are set out, as I mentioned, in&#13;
            paragraph 9 of tt:e President's memorandum.&#13;
&#13;
        :f.R HOPPENO'l1 :    If that quest ion is not clearer than it seems to&#13;
            be, and without having anything against a loan of tha.t im-&#13;
            portance to be made in sterling to South Africa, which is&#13;
&#13;
            certainly a good credit, I would not like to think that&#13;
&#13;
            this Board is exactly            co~~itt1ng   itself.   1 woulc not like&#13;
&#13;
            to give the impression that 1 am against the loan, but this&#13;
&#13;
            is rather a new approach, and I would like to be sure that all&#13;
&#13;
            questions come before us as a            Bo~rd w~tbout      prejudice to the&#13;
            negotiations wben we are asked to approve.&#13;
&#13;
        CHAIR"M.N: Any other qte stionsÂ·z&#13;
                            The only point that Mr Iliff failed to mention is&#13;
            that there is a fairly good possibility, in relation to tte&#13;
&#13;
            loan, of interesting t.be private market in New York in part&#13;
            of this loan.        In conversations with tbe Minister of Finance,&#13;
            we were informed t ha. t he would like to ha. ve a loan of probably&#13;
&#13;
            a 15-year maturity, but he did not know at the time, and was&#13;
                                                    1:~&#13;
            not in a position to say,           wba.t,(e~~~ort1zat1on        ,payments&#13;
            would be - possibly, he tbougbt,~~start somewberefabout&#13;
            t   brae year sf   ~I    think tbat there is a very good chance&#13;
            tbat there might be       ~icipation          in New York   it' the    earlier&#13;
                                       /..&#13;
            part of this loan.        We discussed that with the Minister of&#13;
            Finance, and he is very anxious for us to explore that feature.&#13;
            That would be without our guarantee - in other words, it rnight&#13;
            be a loun made either with 6ee i!'lt:ePeatl eF private bankers in&#13;
&#13;
            New. York or we might make the loan and then, in turn, sell&#13;
&#13;
            part of it without our guarantee.              It would probably have to&#13;
&#13;
            be the latter, becawe this loan, as I understand, will not be&#13;
&#13;
            drawn down- if approved- for about three years.                       It would be&#13;
&#13;
            drawn upon in the neighbourhood of 20 million dollars a year.&#13;
                            Are tbere no other quest ions'?&#13;

            This partial transcript, from the
            session of the Executive Directors of the Bank held on
            Wednesday, September 13, 1950, covers only two proposed
            loans for the First Transport Project and the First
            Electricity Supply Commission (ESCOM) Project. The
            discussion touches on the general financial and economic
            position of South Africa as of 1950, especially the
            country's investment program, foreign exchange-earning
            capacity, and external debt situation.
