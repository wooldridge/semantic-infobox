Good Governance in Africa&#13;

Attempts in the developed world to reinvent government along the lines of the private&#13;
sector-treating the public as custormers by tailoring services directly to their needs&#13;
and expectations-have emerged as one of the most powerful concepts of the decade.&#13;
A necessary ingredient in this result-oriented approach is a focus on integrity. The&#13;
public (customer/consumer) is perceived as the raison d'etre for government, and the&#13;
public view of the government processes are necessarily influenced by the degree to&#13;
which these processes are-or are not-corrupt, and thus unfair and inefficient. But&#13;
the integrity elements also feed into the efficiency and effectiveness of the entire&#13;
process. Leadership and the simplification and demystification of government are&#13;
integral to the attainment of this goal.&#13;
This paper is comprised of three sections, demonstrating the creative partnership that&#13;
can and should be developed between a government, civil society, and (where&#13;
appropriate) a development agency. The sections focus on: a) capacity building with&#13;
result orientation and integrity; b) containing corruption and building integrity; and&#13;
c) enhancing and sustaining a result orientation within the public service.&#13;

THE NEW VISION&#13;
Enforce Leadership Code&#13;
(Dar es Salaam, November 27, 1995)-NEW Tanzanian President, Benjamin Mkapa, has&#13;
declared his assets. Congratulations to Mkapa. By announcing his full list of assets on national&#13;
radio, the newly elected leader, who campaigned on an anti-corruption ticket, has got his&#13;
presidency of to a good start.&#13;
It should buy him good will from the electorate because it is a signal that he is serious about his&#13;
campaign promises. It is also a signal to politicians and bureaucrats responsible for endemic&#13;
corruption that the boss is ready to crack the whip.&#13;
Democracy is accountability and transparency. Mkapa has aptly illustrated this, which should&#13;
encourage political leaders in Tanzania, and particularly in Uganda.&#13;
His party, the Chama Cha Mapinduzi, under outgoing President Ali Hassan Mwinyi has been&#13;
scandal-ridden. Early this year, the nation's founding father Julius Nyerere accused Mwinyi of being&#13;
"corrupt and inept" when Mwinyi fired anti-graft minister Augustine Mrema, in a corruption&#13;
wrangle.&#13;
Corruption had sullied CCM, leading Mrema to quit and form a party that contested the election&#13;
and accusing CCM of graft. Now Mkapa has shown otherwise.&#13;
Uganda needs to borrow a leaf from Tanzania. The Leadership Code of Conduct, which requires&#13;
specified officers to declare their incomes, assets and liabilities from time to time, was passed by&#13;
the National Resistance Council in 1991 but has not been enforced to date.&#13;
Nevertheless the importance of accountability and transparency has been recognised in denoting&#13;
an entire chapter of the new constitution to the Leadership Code.&#13;
Ugandans have a right to know where their leaders' assets are, if only because it is the people&#13;
who, through taxes, contribute to the leader's welfare. The leaders should own only what is&#13;
legitimately due them and should account for whatever they may acquire.&#13;
Declaring assets is one form of inspiring confidence in the people. It seals the social contract-that&#13;
the people are ruled by a government committed to the principles of democracy, so the people will&#13;
respond by being loyal to the government.&#13;
If we are not conscious, Uganda will miss out on this. Why has the Leadership Code not been&#13;
enacted? Is there a fear by those concerned?&#13;
Tanzania has stolen a march on us. Uganda has been at the forefront of enlightened leadership&#13;
in the region and should not lose the initiative to Tanzania or anyone else for that matter. The&#13;
prevaricafion must stop and the Leadership Code should be enforced.&#13;

THE SUNDAY VISION&#13;
Top Government Officials at the Centre of Fraud&#13;
(Kampala, December 3, 1995)-DESPITE government efforts to check corruption, large sums of&#13;
public money and property continue to be stolen. In most cases senior officers are the culprits,&#13;
reports Ofwono Opondo.&#13;
TWO months ago the office of the Inspector General of Government Mr Augustine Ruzindana&#13;
conducted a surprise spot-check on motor garages in and around Kampala and found over 500&#13;
government vehicles vandalised and rotting with the connivance of public servants.&#13;
According to Mr Peter Nyombi, the Legal Counsel to the Inspectorate, some of the vehicles&#13;
vandalised were less than two years on the roads, but sent to garages purportedly for repairs from&#13;
where they are vandalised of crucial spareparts. "Vehicles are stolen in a clever way.. .they are&#13;
diverted to a garage from where windscreens, tyres, lights and so on are removed by officers for&#13;
sale," Nyombi explained during a discussion with journalists on corruption in Uganda.&#13;
The Director of Audit, office of the Auditor General Mr G. Singh gave startling information about&#13;
corruption and abuse of public office in government departments. According to Mr Singh the&#13;
biggest racket of corruption and theft of public funds is in garage bills. 'We've fought but this bill is&#13;
still very high particularly repairs and fuel deposits. You can't tell whether a government officer&#13;
collected 30 or 80 litres of fuel at a particular time."&#13;
Singh enumerated six major areas through which public money was being stolen. These included&#13;
"air supply, contracts, ghost suppliers, employees and companies, the printing of fake cheques,&#13;
manipulation of general receipts, and barter trade protocols." In "air supply" payments are effected&#13;
for neither goods nor services rendered to a public institution with the connivance of heads and&#13;
accounting officers of these bodies.&#13;
While in contracts money was siphoned through engagement of corrupt or dubious companies&#13;
which offer the lowest bids during public tenders, and then revise their bills of quantities as soon as&#13;
the awards have been offered. The public servant then receives a 1 0 or 20 percent commission.&#13;
Often public officers deliberately commit a breach of contract with a contracted company so as to&#13;
bring a litigation in a court of law, so that the money awarded is shared between the concerned&#13;
officer and the company which sued.&#13;
On "ghost" personnel files, correspondences and bank accounts are opened and operated in the&#13;
names of people who do not exist. The files are most of the time with fake photographs attached to&#13;
them. Last month the IGG Mr Augustine Ruzindana clamped on suspected thieves in the ministry of&#13;
Education and Sports headquarters in an over 1 bn/= fraud in the pensions and gratuity&#13;
department.&#13;
He recovered 4,000 of the targeted 10,000 files, most of them fictitious. This fraud was allegedly&#13;
committed by the Principal Accountant pensions department Mr David Mukasa Walakira who was&#13;
charged in court last Wednesday. Through a chain of District Education Officers in Hoima, Luwero,&#13;
Jinja, Tororo, Kibale, Masindi and Mukono, the money disappeared between September, 1994&#13;
and September this year, and most of the documents were later destroyed....&#13;

THE EAST AFRICAN CHRONICLE&#13;
Ombudsman Feared&#13;
(Kampala, December 1, 1995) UGANDA'S new constitution promulgated last month has&#13;
empowered this country's Ombudsman with far reaching powers of arrest and prosecution of people&#13;
suspected of being involved in corruption, the Inspector General of Government (IGGI, Augustine&#13;
Ruzindona, says.&#13;
The effect of these new powers is that Mr. Ruzindana could announce to the Press the interdiction of&#13;
the entire staff of the Pensions Department of the Ministry of Education. Evidence has been found that&#13;
since September 1994, over Ushs. one billion had been misappropriated in the department affecting&#13;
teachers from all over the country. In the district of Mukono alone, (central region) over Ushs. 1 ,330&#13;
million had been embezzled and incriminating files destroyed. To limit damages, the IG's office has&#13;
taken over 4,000 of the 10,000 files in the department.&#13;
IGG has also been assigned the responsibility of enforcing the Leadership Code of Conduct. The&#13;
function of overseeing the adherence to Human Rights has been removed from Mr Ruzindana's office&#13;
with the creation of a Human Rights Commission.&#13;
The Inspectorate of Government, which was responsible to the President since October 8, 1995 now&#13;
only responsible to Parliament. Ruzindana expected the National Assembly to set us a Parliamentary&#13;
Committee to which he would report his findings.&#13;
The Office of the IGG which was established in 1 986 is charged with the promotion of strict&#13;
adherence to the rule of law and the principles of notural justice in administration. It is also responsible&#13;
for the elimination of corruption, abuse of authority and public office and to promote fair, efficient and&#13;
good governance. This is in addition to investigating, public officials or any other authority and moking&#13;
the public aware about the values of constitutionalism, through any media and means.&#13;

THE PEOPLE&#13;
Anti-corruption Crusade Born&#13;
(Mukono, November 29-December 6, 1995) A unique two day workshop on integrity in Uganda&#13;
ended at Colline Hotel Mukono, yesterday. According to Mr Petter Langseth of the World Bank, its the&#13;
first time he has witnessed a seminar of high rankin government officials discuss anti-corruption&#13;
measures together with journalists, any-where in the world.&#13;
Ten journalists who had earlier attended a one week workshop on investigative journalism were&#13;
invited by the Inspector Generol of Government to compliment the reviewing and drawing up of a&#13;
revised anti-corruption action plan. An initial action plan had been drawn in December 1994.&#13;
The workshop was given an update on recent initiatives against international corruption by Mr&#13;
Jeremy Pope of Transparency Centre and former Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Mr Masana also&#13;
gave an update on anti-corruption in Uganda and its improvement. He referred to the new powers of&#13;
the IGG and DPP to arrest and prosecute suspects.&#13;
The participants, in a press release issued at the end of the workshop publicly declared their&#13;
commitment "to bringing about the Uganda which is cleansed of the corruption which plagued the&#13;
country."&#13;
The leaders present are members of the National Integrity System (NIS) working group. Present were&#13;
the IGG, Mr. Augustine Ruzindona, his deputy, Mr. Psomgen and Mr. D Kato, Secretary to the IGG's&#13;
office. Others present were officials from the Auditor General's office, the Ministry of Public Service,&#13;
Decentralization Secretariat, the police, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Information, Central&#13;
Tender Board, and the Law Development Centre.&#13;
Mr Ruzindana in his closing remarks emphasized the building of a coalition which would not only&#13;
involve government officials, but also civic and clerical leaders, security officials, the press and the&#13;
pu6lic.                                                            - Emmanuel Mukanga&#13;

public. The plan should receive political leader-&#13;

attention should be paid to achieving some&#13;

Conclusion&#13;
Reform is a long-term process where attitudes&#13;
and conduct must be taught and reinforced at&#13;
all levels. It should initially only tackle issues&#13;
where it has high impact, or where there is the&#13;
most value added. The reform process requires&#13;
a number of years for policy implementation.&#13;

Box 1: The GPSM Program&#13;
EDI's Governance and Public Sector Management program emphasizes both the piloting of new ap-&#13;
proaches to public sector management issues and the dissemination of lessons learned from such pi-&#13;
lots and elsewhere.&#13;
Our approach involves working with client countries (both governments and civil society) and do-&#13;
nors as partners. Accepting that there is no 'blueprint" for enhanced public sector management, we&#13;
work as facilitators in a learning process, rather than as experts with all the answers.&#13;
Underlying our program are the concepts that there should be, in the public sector: a focus on&#13;
clients, a client orientation in the delivery of public services, and enhanced levels of accountability&#13;
and transparency. As a starting point, we believe that improved governance and public sector man-&#13;
agement rests on improvements in three areas: strengthened institutional capacity, improved service&#13;
delivery, and enhanced national integrity.&#13;
Reflecting these concepts, the GPSM program comprises four principal activities:&#13;
* Improving Public Sector Service Delivery&#13;
* Accountability and Transparency&#13;
* Civil Service Reform&#13;
* Public Expenditure Planning and Management&#13;

Box 2: What Do Service Delivery Surveys Look Like?&#13;
Service Delivery Surveys are designed by local experts for use by public managers and policy mak-&#13;
ers. While SDSs look different in each country context, they are based on similar guiding principles&#13;
and methodologies. SDSs are reiterative results-oriented evaluations schemes to:&#13;
* build local capacifies, and&#13;
* deliver quantitative and qualitative data on impact, coverage and cost.&#13;
SDS supplements existing institutional-based data with community-based data from both the pri-&#13;
vate and public sectors. It includes qualitative and key informant interviews, as well as institutional&#13;
reviews.&#13;
A panel of communities is chosen in a given region or country, which permits comparison be-&#13;
tween communities and over time to meosure the impact of reforms.&#13;
The basic building block of the community-based data is the household survey. Since the house-&#13;
hold is not subdivided by sectors, the methodology is inherently intersectoral.&#13;
A large number of nationals are trained to make the process sustainable. By emphasizing analy-&#13;
sis and communication capacities, SDS can contribute substantively to national capacities for evi-&#13;
dence-based planning. Thus, SDS does not require highly developed capacities to be in place; in-&#13;
stead it takes off from-and develops along with-national capacities.&#13;
SDS has been implemented by the international NGO ClETinternational and EDI in 6 pilot coun-&#13;
tries to date.&#13;
Typically, the costs of an SDS system are lower than surveys of similar designs. But, clients should&#13;
plan for substantial start-up costs. A pilot and at least 2 additional cycles are recommended in order&#13;
to build strong capacity to assure the process is sustainable.&#13;
One cycle of SDS can be completed fairly rapidly, with design, data collection and entry and&#13;
preliminary analysis taking around one month, (The initial cycle will take closer to 2 months.)&#13;

Box 3: ClErinternational's Contributions to SDS&#13;
For almost the same cost as revealing the frequency of an indicator, such as the impact of the Minis-&#13;
try of Environment's public awareness program, or public opinion on the quality of urban transport,&#13;
SDS makes it possible to look behind these indicators, thanks to the contributions of&#13;
ClETinternational.&#13;
By tailoring its "Sentinel Community Surveillance" (SCSI methods to SDS, CIET has helped local&#13;
teams of experts produce analyses and indicators that motivate action.&#13;
The originality of CIET methods lies in its incorporation of:&#13;
* Modern epidemiology to evaluate evidence for planning; and&#13;
* Community voice to produce evidence, analyze it, and motivate subsequent action.&#13;
SCS has been set up by CIET in 35 countries over the last decade and has covered a wide range&#13;
of sectors. With almost global access to computers, these techniques allow detailed analysis of fac-&#13;
tors that contribute to impact at the national, district, municipal, and community level.&#13;

12. For example, work is presently being under-&#13;
taken by the Presidential Commission&#13;
Against Corruption in Tanzania. It is, how-&#13;
ever, a mistake to believe that laws and law-&#13;
yers alone can rectify a problem that in-&#13;
volves a need to change actual behavior-and&#13;
in some cases survival methods-on a day-to-&#13;
day basis.&#13;
13  The public in Uganda has generally been&#13;
dissatisfied with reforms that have failed to&#13;
jail senior figures, even though a significant&#13;
number of senior civil service leaders have&#13;
been disciplined and in a number of cases&#13;
removed from office. The approach of es-&#13;
tablishing a Uganda Revenue Authority,&#13;
outside the civil service and well-remuner-&#13;
ated, is proving to have won public confi-&#13;
dence, and tax collection has risen dramati-&#13;
cally. The same model is being pursued in&#13;
Tanzania.&#13;

            Good governance in Africa : a case study
            from Uganda
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper examines the broader issue of
            governance that includes capacity building, integrity, and
            the focus on public sector service delivery and results.
            This holistic approach is being applied to Uganda. The paper
            is comprised of three sections, demonstrating the creative
            partnership that can and should be developed between a
            government, civil society, and a development agency. The
            sections focus on: a) capacity building with result
            orientation and integrity; b) containing corruption and
            building integrity; and c) enhancing and sustaining a result
            orientation within the public service.
