      GUIDANCE NOTE ON ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE&#13;
            FOR THE SAVA RIVER BASIN â&#128;&#147; FLOODING&#13;
&#13;
1        Background&#13;
This report provides guidance note for decision making on the adaptation needs related to floods in&#13;
the Sava River Basin (SRB). This guidance note is one of the components of the Water and Climate&#13;
Adaptation Plan (WATCAP) being prepared by the Consultant for the International Sava River Basin&#13;
Commission (ISRBC) under World Bank funding.1 It builds on the main WATCAP report (World Bank,&#13;
2013b), the report on the development of future climate scenarios (Vujadinovic and Vukovic, 2013)&#13;
and on the report on development of the hydrologic model for the Sava River basin (World Bank,&#13;
2013a).&#13;
&#13;
Furthermore, there are essentially three recent studies that have been undertaken by the University of&#13;
Ljubljana under the title â&#128;&#156;Pilot project on climate change: Building the link between flood risk man-&#13;
agement planning and climate change assessment In The Sava River Basin (SRB), Component A3:&#13;
Compilation of various existing climate change scenarios for the region, their expected impacts on&#13;
water cycle and more specifically on frequency and magnitude of extreme flood eventsâ&#128;&#157;. These stud-&#13;

Meteorological data from simulations of 16 different ENSEMBLES GCM/RCM model runs were used&#13;
for preparation of projections. All simulations for the 21st Century were done using only the IPCC&#13;
SRES A1B emission scenario, since it has been recognized that the choice of the emission scenario&#13;
is less relevant until the middle of the 21st Century. The A1B scenario assumes a future world of rapid&#13;
economic growth, low population growth and rapid introduction of new and more efficient technolo-&#13;
gies. Major underlying themes are economic and cultural convergence and capacity building, with a&#13;
substantial reduction in regional differences in per capita income. It is assumed that under the A1B&#13;
scenario, people pursue personal wealth rather than environmental quality.&#13;

Â &#13;
Simulations generally cover a time period between 1961 and 2100. Simulations of two different mete-&#13;
orological variables were used in study: daily precipitation and daily mean air temperature. E-OBS&#13;
data (daily precipitation) were used as a reference (observational) dataset for comparison and deriva-&#13;
tion of transfer functions. These data have been designed to provide the best estimate of grid box av-&#13;
erages to enable a direct comparison with RCMs. The E-OBS dataset was defined on the same 0.25&#13;
degree grid resolution. The E-OBS dataset covers the period between 1950 and 2011.&#13;
&#13;
ENSEMBLES climate model runs were used to produce climate projections for the SRB. Statistical&#13;
bias correction was used to correct raw model simulations for systematic biases. Validation procedure&#13;
showed that statistical bias correction improved quality of daily precipitation and temperature simula-&#13;
tions over the majority of the basin area and was also dependent on the season.&#13;
&#13;
Climate projections for the Sava river basin were calculated, based on derived transfer functions for&#13;
the period 1961-2000. Transfer functions were applied to climate projections for the 21st Century from&#13;
RCM simulations. Three periods were used for assessing future climate change: 2011-2040, 2041-&#13;
2070 and 2071-2100. For each of the periods, absolute values for seasonal precipitation and extreme&#13;
precipitation were determined as well as the differences from the reference period (1971-2000) val-&#13;
ues. Results are provided in forms of images, where spatial distributions for the Sava river basin for&#13;
each of the variables are shown. Results for the 100-year return period autumn daily precipitation are&#13;
given in Figure 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Note: Units on all images are in mm.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 1: Ensemble mean, spread (from 16 different model runs) and observed values for autumn daily precipitation&#13;
              intensity with return period 100 years for the reference period (1971-2000).&#13;
In general, temperature was expected to increase over the basin area in all seasons (the most pro-&#13;
nounced increase can be observed for summer and winter). On the other hand, precipitation is ex-&#13;
pected to decrease in spring, summer and autumn (with the most pronounced decrease in summer),&#13;
whereas an increase in the winter is expected, especially in north-western part of the basin.&#13;
&#13;
In general, the highest model simulation spread was observed over the most complex orography (e.g.&#13;
Julian Alps, KamniÅ¡ko-Savinjske Alps and Dinaric Alps). This introduced some level of uncertainty in&#13;
the simulation results over that area. Consequently it is recommended that climate model simulations&#13;
of large scale circulation patterns, which influence the weather and climate in the basin, should be&#13;
verified in the future. This will enable determination of the primary causes of systematic model biases&#13;
when simulating large scale precipitation and other meteorological variables.&#13;
&#13;
Furthermore, a sensitivity study on convective parameterization schemes that are used in climate&#13;
models to simulate sub-grid scale convective precipitation would enable a better understanding and&#13;
help evaluate the abovementioned uncertainty, related to extreme precipitation events over the basin&#13;

3        Part 2 â&#128;&#147; Climate Change Impact on Flood Discharge&#13;
The WB trends report (Meerbach et al 2010) did not analyse peak flood flows and droughts; whilst the&#13;
report from the Exeter University (Jupp et all 2011) was not useful for flood prediction. Furthermore,&#13;
floods are also not substantially mentioned in the UNFCCC national communications from the SRB&#13;
countries. Whenever they are mentioned, there is a general concern that climate change is causing&#13;
more extreme events to occur, such as floods.&#13;
&#13;
Flood runoff generation is a complex non-linear process that cannot be easily estimated from precipi-&#13;
tation data. Hence for the transformation of extreme precipitation data into flood runoff, a hydrological&#13;
model is needed that is capable of reproducing the basin response during extreme precipitation rather&#13;
than runoff from moderate precipitation amounts. Such a hydrological model was developed for the&#13;
Sava River Basin (Brilly et al 2011) and the extreme precipitation data from different climate projec-&#13;
tions was used as input for the model (along with the temperature projections).&#13;
&#13;
The Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) model is a conceptual model developed by&#13;
the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute for continuous runoff simulation and is often&#13;
used in hydrological forecasting (IHMS, 1999). The model structure is presented schematically in Fig-&#13;
ure 2 and is based on the water balance equation:&#13;

&#13;
where: P is precipitation, ET is evapotranspiration, Q is runoff, SP is snowpack, SM is soil moisture,&#13;
UZ is water storage in upper reservoir, LZ is water storage in lower reservoir and lakes is water stor-&#13;
age in lakes.&#13;

For the purpose of modelling, the SRB was divided into elevation and vegetation zones, especially&#13;
important for calculating snowfall and snowmelt. The basin is divided into sub-basins as shown in Ta-&#13;
ble 1 and Figure 3.&#13;

Input data for calibration (precipitation, temperature, evapotranspiration, discharge) was collected for&#13;
the period from June 1 to December 31, 1974. This corresponded to the period of the 1974 flood&#13;
event, which is regarded as the last major flood to take place in the SRB before major flood protection&#13;
construction works were put in place in the Sava River valley (Posavina). An important characteristic&#13;
of the 1974 flood event was major rainfall that moved with time from the east to the west part of the&#13;
Sava River Basin. Maximum precipitation on the Drina River basin occurred two days after maximum&#13;
precipitation in Slovenia and the resulting flood peaks from Slovenia and the right tributaries coincided&#13;
at the confluence of the Sava River and the Drina River.&#13;

The verification period was from 1st September, 1978 to 30th November, 1978. During this event the&#13;
peak discharges were quite high, but lower than during the 1974 event; another advantage was that&#13;
data from the weather stations were available for modelling. The results of calibration and verification&#13;
of the model are not impressive, especially for sub-basins. This is because the sub-basins were mod-&#13;
elled as homogeneous areas except the Drina River Basin. The main goal of the calibration was to&#13;
reproduce flood peaks and not water balance (Table 2).&#13;

&#13;
In order to utilize information on extreme precipitation data from the available climate scenarios as an&#13;
input to the hydrologic model and to make it possible to predict hydrological response to climate&#13;
change, precipitation and temperature data from the climate scenarios were taken from the raster da-&#13;
ta set based on the position of rain gauge stations and transformed in order to be used for hydrologi-&#13;
cal modelling. The transformation was derived based on the differences between precipitation ob-&#13;
served at meteorological stations and gridded precipitation in the E-OBS data.&#13;
&#13;
The maximum daily values of the precipitation measured in 1974 are mainly slightly lower than the&#13;
values of E-OBS. A high discrepancy between the E-OBS data and the measurements is present in&#13;
the area of the Dinaric Mountains, especially in Montenegro. The value at the Å½abljak station is two&#13;
times higher than that in the E-OBS data with the 20-year return period and even the 100-years return&#13;
period (Table 3). There is a concern that for the E-OBS data set the precipitation from Montenegro&#13;
was not considered.&#13;
&#13;
Table 3 shows that maximum summer daily precipitation is slightly higher than in autumn. However,&#13;
runoff in the autumn season is much higher due to less evaporation than in summer, so for further&#13;
analysis the autumn values were chosen.&#13;

Climate scenarios for 2011â&#128;&#147;2040, 2041â&#128;&#147;2070 and 2071â&#128;&#147;2100 show interesting dynamics. The au-&#13;
tumn precipitation for some stations increase with time, while with other stations there is first an in-&#13;
crease and then a decrease. Average values of precipitation having a 20-year return period across&#13;
the basin show a very small increase between periods 2041â&#128;&#147;2070 and 2071â&#128;&#147;2100, and even a slight&#13;
decrease for the 100-year return period precipitation (Table 4).&#13;

The probabilities of maximum precipitation are based on the Gumbel probability distribution and were&#13;
calculated using the observed precipitation data from the trends report (Meerbach 2010), and the re-&#13;
sults are given in Table 5. The period of observation varied from 1908 or 1951 to 2009. The differ-&#13;
ences in the 20-year precipitation from the Gumbel distribution and E-OBS vary. At some stations the&#13;
Gumbel distribution yields higher values than those calculated from E-OBS, and vice versa. For the&#13;
100-year precipitation, only the values from Slovenian stations are lower if calculated using the Gum-&#13;
bel distribution than from the E-OBS data. All other stations have higher values. Finally, the 100-year&#13;
return period projected values for 2041-2070 are lower than the 100-year precipitation for all stations.&#13;

Temperature data vary significantly inside the SRB; however, the variation in projections is rather&#13;
small. For further calculations an increase of 0.8oC in autumn was chosen in the period 2011â&#128;&#147;2040,&#13;
1.8oC for autumn in the period 2041â&#128;&#147;2070 and 2.9oC in the period 2071â&#128;&#147;2100 for the watershed as a&#13;
whole.&#13;
&#13;
The HBV model was used to assess climate change forecasts on the Sava River discharges at se-&#13;
lected stations. Input data for these simulations were the same as for the model calibration against&#13;
the 1974 flood except that daily precipitation data was changed with the maximum precipitation and&#13;
the increased temperature. Instead of using the measured maximum daily precipitation, projected&#13;
maximum daily precipitation was used.&#13;
&#13;
Firstly, calculated peak discharges for the E-OBS (1971â&#128;&#147;2010) data having 20- and 100-year return&#13;
periods were compared. The calibrated peak discharges in the central part of the watershed down to&#13;
Sava III are lower than those calculated with the E-OBS data for the 20-year return period. Values of&#13;
discharge in the lower part of the watershed are between the values calculated for the E-OBS data for&#13;
20- and 100-year return periods. The Drina River flood peak discharges are much higher than those&#13;
calculated with the E-OBS 100-year return period data. The values of the Vrbas River are in-between&#13;
and the Bosna River has much lower discharges than those calculated.&#13;

&#13;
The results of modelling with the E-OBS data and climate change scenarios (Table 6 and 7) show the&#13;
projected flood peaks of the 20-year return period will increase in the period 2071â&#128;&#147;2100 on average&#13;
from 14 % up to 23 % in the upper part of the basin and on some tributaries. The simulated base flow&#13;
drops a little due to higher temperatures. The flood peaks along the main stream will increase in the&#13;
next 60 years from 8 % on the inflow in the Danube to 33 % at the head water part of the catchment.&#13;
The projected discharges will increase in future due to climate change. However, the predicted dis-&#13;
charges on the Drina River and at the downstream Sremska Mitrovica station on the Sava River for&#13;
2071â&#128;&#147;2100 are lower than those for 2041â&#128;&#147;2070.&#13;

The discrepancies in the peak discharges on the Drina River basin could be the result of fewer cli-&#13;
mate prediction models used for the 2071â&#128;&#147;2100 precipitation projections. Also some results of climate&#13;
change modelling (Rakovec and Ceglar, 2012) which were used for periods 2011â&#128;&#147;2040 and 2041â&#128;&#147;&#13;
2070 were not available for the 2071â&#128;&#147;2100 projections.&#13;

The percentages of increase of flood discharges produced by precipitation of 100-year precipitation&#13;
indicate a higher increase than the values from the 20-year precipitation. The average increase for the&#13;
period until 2100 is 14 % and 23 % for the 20- and 100-year precipitation, respectively. The highest&#13;
increase is observed at the Ä&#140;ateÅ¾ hydrologic station on the Sava River with 49 %, followed by the&#13;
Bosna River (44%) and the Una River (56%). The changes in the Drina River and at the Sremska Mi-&#13;
trovica station show similar anomalies as the discharges of the 20-year return period.&#13;
&#13;
The calculated values given are valid for the most downstream stations on the tributaries, but the per-&#13;
centage of increase could be used for the watershed as a whole. The upper part of the watershed at&#13;
the Ä&#140;ateÅ¾ station has the greatest increase, up to 49 %. The tributary Kolpa River has a much lower&#13;
increase, up to 13%. The Una River tributary has a 60% increase in discharge up to year 2070 fol-&#13;
lowed by a smaller increase because of smaller precipitation up to year 2100. The dynamics of the&#13;
100-year projected flood peaks for the Vrbas River tributary is similar, i.e. an increase by 20 % fol-&#13;
lowed by a decrease of 17 %. The flood discharge of the Bosna River will increase for 44 % until the&#13;
end of the century. The Drina River has a similar dynamics to those of the Una River and Vrbas River;&#13;
however the drop in the last period of projection is more significant. The flood discharge will increase&#13;
up to 27 % and then drop to 12 % which is similar to the increase in the first period of projection. The&#13;
projected discharges increase along the Sava River indicating a drop from the Ä&#140;ateÅ¾ station (49 %) to&#13;
17 % at Crnac and to 14 % at Jasenovac which is the same value as that at Slavonski Brod. The per-&#13;
centage of increase downstream at Å½upanja is up to 25 %. Downstream of the Drina River mouth the&#13;
percentage of increase for 2041â&#128;&#147;2070 is 15 % at Sremska Mitrovica and a smaller increase of 12 %&#13;
for 2071â&#128;&#147;2100.&#13;
&#13;
Uncertainty in the calculated climate predictions of precipitation is estimated at 30 % at the 90 % con-&#13;
fidence level. We also designed a model of the Sava River with HBV-Light model and undertook cal-&#13;
culations by the same procedure to analyse uncertainties. The analysis showed discrepancies be-&#13;
tween the models that are less than 10 % (BoÅ¾ek, 2013). Thus, we assume a final overall uncertainty&#13;
of calculated flood discharges roughly as Â± 40% of the values presented in Tables 6 and 7.&#13;
&#13;
A probability analysis was undertaken building on the probability analysis in the report by Prohaska&#13;
(2009) with data collected in the period 1926â&#128;&#147;1965. The analysis does not consider the impact of&#13;
flood protection measures in the Central Posavina, as they were developed later. The floods having&#13;
90%, 99% and 99.9% probability of non-exceedance were used to create basic flood-frequency rela-&#13;
tionships at hydrologic stations. Probability of floods calculated from the E-OBS precipitation of the&#13;
20- and 100-year return periods were estimated based on probability from report by Prohaska (2009).&#13;
We assumed that predicted floods calculated by model with the predicted maximum E-OBS precipita-&#13;
tion have the same probability as today floods. We then determined new probability curves of maxi-&#13;
mum discharges for each future period on the basis of their parallel displacement according to E-OBS&#13;
projection. In this way we estimated the floods for different probabilities, according to data in the re-&#13;
port (Prohaska, 2009).&#13;
&#13;
The calculated results on the current 100-year return period of flood discharges and flood levels at&#13;
selected hydrologic stations within the SRB show that:&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   Floods at Ä&#140;ateÅ¾ will increase by almost 22% in the first period (2011â&#128;&#147;2040) and by 55% until the&#13;
    year 2100, implying that the 100-year flood discharge will increase by 1661 m3/s, while the flood&#13;
    water level will increase by 226 cm in 2100 to a maximum of 9.70 metres (Figure 6).&#13;

Â &#13;
At all hydrologic stations the gradual increase of water levels of the 100-year floods is expected in fu-&#13;
ture. The only exception is Sremska Mitrovica, where, during the first two periods until 2070, the water&#13;
level rises and then it starts to decrease slightly. The largest increase in the level at the end of the&#13;
century, i.e. by more than 2 metres, is expected in the upper part of the basin at Ä&#140;ateÅ¾.&#13;
Downstream the Sava River, the water level rise is strongly reduced to 0.82 m at Crnac. Downstream&#13;
of Crnac, the water level gradually increases up to 1.81 m at Å½upanja. Then, downstream of Å½upanja,&#13;
the increase of water level strongly drops to 0.10 m at Sremska Mitrovica.&#13;
&#13;
It should be noted that the model was calibrated for the 1974 flood event, i.e. before any major con-&#13;
struction on the â&#128;&#156;Central Posavinaâ&#128;&#157; flood protection system was developed. The impact of this system&#13;
and the impact of hydropower plant Mratinje in the Drina River Basin could not be implemented in the&#13;
model. Notably, the hydrological model reflects semi-natural conditions, without taking into considera-&#13;
tion the structures developed after 1974.&#13;
&#13;
Even though the above estimates for the increase in discharge due to climate change impact are&#13;
high, they are still much lower than the Probable Maximum Flood of 7081 m3/s, estimated for the up-&#13;
per Sava when undertaking a study for the KrÅ¡ko Nuclear Power Plant (Brilly et al., 2009) and also&#13;
lower than the historical flood that occurred in 1896 in the Drina Basin and in the lower part of the Sa-&#13;
va River.&#13;
&#13;
There is evidence that the process of reforestation has decreased the mean discharges in the exper-&#13;
imental river basin in Slovenia by 35 % (Å raj and Brilly, 2012). Consequently such a process will de-&#13;
crease flood discharges and mitigate the impact of climate change on floods in the SRB. It follows&#13;
therefore that the process of reforestation should be studied in more detail at selected locations&#13;
throughout the whole SRB.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4        Part 3 â&#128;&#147; Flood Vulnerability Assessment&#13;
The pilot project on climate change adaptation, building a link between flood risk management plan-&#13;
ning and climate change assessment in the SRB provides an overview on the vulnerability of the&#13;
flood-prone areas of the Basin and considers population, economic activities, special structures and&#13;
objects, protected areas â&#128;&#147; i.e. nature, and cultural heritage.&#13;
&#13;
As expected, the most vulnerable zones are those flood prone areas that overlap with big settlements&#13;
with high population density and economic activities. Some parts between Zagreb and Slavonski&#13;
Brod, as well as some eastern parts of the Basin are vulnerable due to protected natural habitats. Al-&#13;
most 50% of flood prone areas is classified as having moderate vulnerability and the remainder is&#13;
equally distributed between high and low vulnerability.&#13;
&#13;
Areas with high vulnerability are mainly those around Zagreb, Belgrade and areas at the confluence&#13;
with the Drina River into the Sava River. Sensitivity analysis was performed only within the 100 year&#13;
return flood zone, but not beyond. Historical events like the 1896 in the Drina River and the Probable&#13;
Maximum Flood event with extremely high water downstream on the Sava River need special treat-&#13;
ment. The question on how will vulnerability change in the future and what will be the change in popu-&#13;
lation density is also important.&#13;
&#13;
There is also the process of reforestation already mentioned above, which has a strong impact on the&#13;
water balance and decrease in discharge. In Slovenia, the area covered by forest is increasing by al-&#13;
most 1% each year, however in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the reverse is taking place.&#13;
&#13;
A number of packages of short-term, medium-term and long-term mitigation measures for flood pro-&#13;
tection on the SRB and to combat climate change have been elaborated. These are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
1. Phase A: Short-term measures over the next three years with cost of Euro 50 million, including:&#13;

2. Phase B: Medium-term measures over the next 15 years with cost of Euro 1 billion, including:&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   Institutional strengthening of the organizations responsible for the collection and exchange of hy-&#13;
    drological data. Purchase of new state-of-the-art equipment as: meteorological radars, measure-&#13;
    ment of snow cover water content and soil moisture.&#13;
ï&#130;·   Increase of the level of protection of major cities along the Sava River: Belgrade, Zagreb and&#13;
    Ljubljana. Similar protection should be developed for critical infrastructures: highways, railroads,&#13;
    industrial and health care buildings.&#13;
ï&#130;·   The protection of other cities and populated areas along the Sava River depending on long-term&#13;

&#13;
3. Phase C: Long-term measures over the next 50 years with a cost of Euro 2 billion, including:&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   Continuation and completion of works in the all of segments.&#13;
ï&#130;·   The protection of cities and populated areas along the Sava River depending on long-term spatial&#13;
    planning and future development. Zoning should be integrated with spatial planning.&#13;
ï&#130;·   Giving more space to rivers, by deepening and widening of the river channel; increasing the&#13;
    floodplains (flood retention areas) by lowering the surface and the movement of dams; removal of&#13;
    structures that impede water flow; and similar with special attention to river front development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5        Conclusions&#13;
ï&#130;·   In general all literature on floods in the SRB indicates that future flood events will increase, but&#13;
    there has been no real quantification of this expectation. Recent work by Brilly et al (2012) has&#13;
    tried to redress this inadequacy.&#13;
ï&#130;·   The E-OBS data set is useful for hydrological climate change forecasts of flood peak discharges in&#13;
    the SRB. However this data set is not accurate enough for some parts of SRB and additional im-&#13;
    provements of the E-OBS data are required.&#13;
ï&#130;·   Climate change will increase the peak discharges mainly in the head part of the Sava River Basin&#13;
    watershed. The peak discharges will increase at the end of the 21st century for the 100-year re-&#13;
    turn period i.e. from 3 % at Sremska Mitrovica up to 55 % at Ä&#140;ateÅ¾.&#13;
ï&#130;·   There are some discrepancies in the Drina River basin, i.e. the discharges in the forecast for peri-&#13;
    od 2071â&#128;&#147;2100 were lower than those for period 2041â&#128;&#147;2070. This also resulted in the lower dis-&#13;
    charge downstream of the confluence with the Sava River. Similar discrepancies but not as strong&#13;
    are presented on the tributaries Una River, Vrbas River and Bosna River.&#13;
ï&#130;·   The probability functions were derived for water stations along the main stream of the Sava River&#13;
    with an estimation of high flows up to the flows with the return period of 1000 years. The climate&#13;
    change forecast was derived for the periods 2011â&#128;&#147;2040, 2041â&#128;&#147;2070 and 2071â&#128;&#147;2100.&#13;
ï&#130;·   The impact of climate change on the water level forecasts with 100-year return period floods is&#13;
    quite high in the head part of the watershed, i.e. more than 2 m. Downstream it initially strongly&#13;
    decreases then it gradually increases up to 1.81 m and finally it drops to 0.10 m at Sremska Mi-&#13;
    trovica.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      Page 14&#13;

Â &#13;
ï&#130;·       The Central Posavina region is an extremely important flood retention basin which needs to be&#13;
        protected from further development (building of flood protection structures, levees etc.).&#13;
ï&#130;·       There is clear evidence that reforestation has decreased the mean discharges in Slovenia by up&#13;
        to 35 % and consequently such actions will decrease flood discharges and mitigate the impact of&#13;
        climate change on floods in the SRB. Further research on reforesting should be undertaken on&#13;
        other areas of the SRB.&#13;
ï&#130;·       As part of a mitigation and climate change adaptation, a number of packages of short-term, medi-&#13;
        um-term and long-term measures for flood protection on the SRB have been elaborated. These&#13;
        measures have been predicted to cost more than Euros 3 billion over the next 50 years and in-&#13;
        clude integrated water management, spatial planning and sustainable development activities in&#13;
        order to assure the production of synergistic effects and the optimum use of funds.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This report presents the water and
            climate adaptation plan (WATCAP) developed for the Sava
            river basin (SRB) as result of a study undertaken by the
            World Bank. The WATCAP is intended to help to bridge the gap
            between the climate change predictions for the SRB and the
            decision makers in current and planned water management
            investment projects that will be affected by changing
            climate trends. The purpose of the report is to: (i) assist
            stakeholders and decision makers in assessing and planning
            for the risks generated by climate change impacts on water
            resources; (ii) provide a basis for future plans and studies
            of adaptation to climate change impacts in the SRB; and
            (iii) stimulate cooperation and debate across the basin
            toward additional and more detailed studies on climate
            change impacts at the regional and basin scale. The SRB is
            projected to experience small increases in water use by the
            public water supply, industry, energy, and agricultural and
            irrigation sectors. However, it is widely expected that new
            hydropower plants (HPPs) will be constructed in the near
            future, making energy (primarily through hydropower) the
            most important water use in the SRB.
