1. TRANSPORT BOTTLENECKS AND REFORMS&#13;
A. INIRODUCTION&#13;
1.1       Since the mid-1980s, China's transport system-and especially the railway-&#13;
has been unable to handle the country's spiraling growth of freight and passenger traffic&#13;
(average annual growth rates of about 7 percent and 10 percent, respectively). Many key&#13;
railway lines have developed bottlenecks where traffic in at least one direction reaches&#13;
95 percent of the design capacity or more. These bottlenecks occurred on less than&#13;
10 percent of the network in the mid-1980s, but reached nearly 40 percent by the end of&#13;
the decade. This, in turn, causes the railway to ration service extensively.&#13;
1.2       The situation developed because the economy grew  rapidly after the&#13;
Government adopted the open-door policy in 1978 (averaging 9.4 percent a year from 1980&#13;
to 1993). And, although capacity was also expanded-with the network more than&#13;
doubling in the last three decades-it still did not keep pace with economic growth. In&#13;
fact, the network is one of the sparest in the world, compared with the area and population&#13;
it serves (see the figure below; Table 1.1). Thus, China has not been well-served by either&#13;
the rail or highway system and growth has been hampered (most severely in the&#13;
hinterland). According to World Bank figures, this led to at least a 1 percent loss of GNP&#13;
annually.&#13;

1.3       The railway system was unable to match economic growth for two reasons.&#13;
First, the country underinvested in transport infrastructure-an annual average of&#13;
1.4 percent of GNP from 1980 to 1993, compared to 2 to 3 percent in Brazil and India&#13;
(Tables 1.4 and 1.5). Second, authorities did not apply congestion pricing on routes with&#13;
bottlenecks to moderate demand and raise more revenues to expand capacity. To correct&#13;
the capacity problem, China has embarked on a massive investment program since 1992:&#13;
it aims to build by the year 2000 some 16,000 route-km of new railway lines to add to the&#13;
existing 54,000 route-km, and some 5,000 route-km of new high-capacity, high-speed&#13;
expressways to add to the roughly 1,500 route-km of expressways built so far.&#13;
1.4       If China is to move to a market economy fully, another set of pressing issues&#13;
also need to be resolved. These relate to regulations and the relationship between the&#13;
railway system and the Government, the railway's management and organization, and its&#13;
technology, operations and services. The railway recognizes that it must undertake&#13;
reforms so as to operate in a market economy. MOR formulated its own vision of changes&#13;
in a 30-Point Action Statement for Railway Reform, which was endorsed by the State&#13;
Council in April 1994 (Chapter 2), and which the proposed project will support.&#13;
B. TRAlc&#13;
1.5       The surge in traffic occurred despite capacity constraints and related&#13;
bottlenecks. Highway freight traffic grew at the highest annual rate (14.2 percent),&#13;
compared with 6.3 percent for railway traffic and 9.7 percent for coastal and inland&#13;
waterway traffic (Table 1.2). Nevertheless, intercity passenger travel per capita remains&#13;
very low-about two thirds the level in India. Civil aviation traffic, which grew at&#13;
17.7 percent a year (from a very low base) from 1982 to 1993, remains limited-with&#13;
market share of 6 percent-while long-distance passenger rail traffic grew by 7.5 percent&#13;
a year during the same period (Table 1.3).&#13;
1.6       Although the railway's share of total traffic declined over the past decade as&#13;
the road network developed, rail transport still dominates: In 1993, about 55 percent of&#13;
freight (Table 1.2) and about 44 percent of passengers (Table 1.3) moved by rail, and the&#13;
rest moved by road, inland waterway, coastal shipping, pipeline and air. The dominance&#13;
in freight transport is due partly to the economy's past dependence on heavy industry and&#13;
partly to comparatively poor road conditions and small, inefficient vehicles.  With&#13;
passenger transport, it is partly due to inadequate intercity bus service, the virtual absence&#13;
of private automobiles, and the limited use of civil aviation. However, the move to a&#13;
market economy will increase demand for more responsive transport and thus shift the&#13;
emphasis to road transport-although it will still leave a growing market for the relatively&#13;
low-cost rail services.&#13;
C. PAST TRANsPoRT REFoRMs&#13;
1.7       In the past decade, China attempted to increase economic efficiency with&#13;
reforms designed to: (a) reduce Government intervention in the production and distribution&#13;
process; (b) reduce its deficits and subsidies to state-owned enterprises (SOEs); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
(c) open the economy by expanding trade and allowing greater participation of private and&#13;
collective enterprises.&#13;
1.8      In transport, the country also launched various reforms. These included:&#13;
(a)  Eliminating almost all price distortions by (i) decreasing the volume of&#13;
commodities produced under the state plan; (ii) raising the in-plan commodity&#13;
prices closer to market levels; (iii) raising the tariffs charged by state transport&#13;
enterprises for railways, highways and waterways; and (iv) reducing operating&#13;
and capital subsidies for major infrastructure services through higher cost-&#13;
recovery and user-funded capital construction funds;&#13;
(b)  Allowing private individuals and collective and township enterprises to provide&#13;
passenger and freight services on roads and inland waterways, and&#13;
encouraging provincial and national authorities to develop local railways and&#13;
other transport projects with private sector financing;&#13;
(c)  Introducing structural reforms in the organization and management of the ports&#13;
and civil aviation, which have increased financial autonomy and&#13;
accountability, reduced central government controls, and paved the way for&#13;
competitive services;&#13;
(d)  Encouraging the introduction of more modem transport technology, primarily&#13;
by improving rolling stock; enhancing container and bulk handling capacity in&#13;
the ports; improving road pavement design and geometric standards; and&#13;
increasing the use of computerized data processing and planning techniques in&#13;
all modes.&#13;
D. BANK GROUP PARTICIPATION AND FuTURE TRANSPORT REFORMS&#13;
1.9       The Bank Group has supported government initiatives in transport through&#13;
loans and credits of $4.53 billion for 29 projects (Table 1.6 and Annex I . These projects,&#13;
which represent 6 to 8 percent of government-financed investments during 1982 to 1992,&#13;
involved:&#13;
(a)  Expanding rail capacity; modernizirg locomotives and rolling stock, facilities,&#13;
track maintenance, telecommunications and information systems; providing&#13;
technical assistance (TA) and training programs ($1.78 billion in seven&#13;
projects);&#13;
(b)  Constructing 2,180 km  of high-quality national and provincial roads,&#13;
upgrading 6,850 km of rural roads, improving the supervision and quality&#13;
control of road construction; conducting studies of key issues in road safety,&#13;
pavement management, user charges and methods of financing for road&#13;
maintenance and construction; and upgrading roads and inland waterways in&#13;
Jiangsu Province ($1.82 billion in 12 projects);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
(c)  Constructing terminals, jetties and berths in six ports, dredging navigation&#13;
channels, and providing TA and training for port planning, operations&#13;
management and containerization ($715 million in eight projects);&#13;
(d)  Improving urban transport in Shanghai, including upgrading infrastructure and&#13;
improving urban transport planning, finance and management ($210 million&#13;
in two projects).&#13;
1.10      The Government-Bank dialogue has occurred through project preparation&#13;
activities, project-financed studies and secto. studies done in collaboration with Chinese&#13;
authorities, especially in the areas of multimodal transport investment and the setting of&#13;
sectoral priorities. Eight studies explored multimodal pricing and investment issues.&#13;
These included the Waterway Transport Sector Study, the Guangdong Comprehensive&#13;
Transport Planning Study, the Yangtze Economic Zone Transport Study (YEZTS), the&#13;
Coal Transport Study (CTS), the Railway Investment Study (RIS), the Strategic Issues in&#13;
Ports and Shipping (SIPS) Study, the Price Reform Study, and the Road Freight Service&#13;
Study. Further, the Bank and the Government prepared railway and highway strategies&#13;
so as to provide broad, long-term recommendations on how the two largest transport&#13;
subsectors should be developed and reformed.&#13;
1.11      Recommendations from all these efforts were used as inputs to transport&#13;
planning, pricing and reforms. CTS and RIS results supported the Government's decision&#13;
in 1992 to raise the economic growth rate for infrastructure investment planning from&#13;
6 percent a year to 8-9 percent; SIPS results supported the decisions to invest in container&#13;
transport. The Price Reform Study Report was a basis for a major Government-Bank&#13;
dialogue, with railway tariffs used as a key example of the need for price reform. The&#13;
Ministry of Railways (MOR) drew on the railway strategy paper when preparing its&#13;
30-Point Action Statement, which was endorsed by the State Council in April 1994.&#13;
1.12      Six other studies funded under Railways IV, V and VI focused on technical&#13;
improvements with systemwide implications, including its telecommunications and&#13;
information systems, maintenance and rehabilitation of track and equipment (locomotives&#13;
and rolling stock), electrification, and heavy-haul operations. MOR applied their findings&#13;
when it modernized the railway.&#13;
1.13      Finally, eight other studies were launched under Railways VI to deal with&#13;
costing, tariffs, and accounting issues, as well as regulations, management concerns, and&#13;
restructuring.  They provided a basis for:  (a) rationalizing tariffs in the market&#13;
framework; (b) redefining the Government-railway relationship; (c) restructuring the&#13;
monolithic railway organization into a number of profit-oriented, market-focused&#13;
enterprises; (d) bolstering the railway's treasury capability; (e) improving its labor&#13;
productivity; (f) rationalizing its diversified businesses; (g) reforming its housing system;&#13;
and (h) enhancing its human resources. Some of the studies' results underpin the Bank's&#13;
reform assistance under Railways VII.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
1.14      Still, the Government needs to take further measures to alleviate bottlenecks&#13;
and rationalize the transport system, in particular:&#13;
(a)  Boost the level of transport investment relative to GNP to expand capacity to&#13;
meet new demands and eliminate underinvestment backlogs; realize the most&#13;
economic balance of investments among the major modes (railway, highway,&#13;
waterway and civil aviation);&#13;
(b)  Further increase the productivity of existing transport assets through&#13;
technological modernization and management reforms-for example by&#13;
applying congestion pricing to selected bottleneck links to moderate transport&#13;
demand and raise more revenues for transport capacity expansion, and by&#13;
adding a premium for better services; and&#13;
(c)  Improve and expand the multimodal transport system, both across and within&#13;
modes, particularly through more extensive use of containers.&#13;
1.15      The Bank will continue to assist the Govemment in designing and&#13;
implementing transport reforms. For example, a Transport Logistics Study was launched&#13;
with the Chinese authorities to establish a policy framework for market-oriented,&#13;
intermodal freight transport, dealing with improving distribution of seabome containers and&#13;
modernizing customs documentation and clearance processes.&#13;

2. TIE RAILWAY SYSTEM AND REFORM OPPORTUNITIES&#13;
A. TE RAmLWAY SYSTEM&#13;
2.1       The railway system is the dominant mode of transport in China, carrying about&#13;
55 percent of the country's total freight and about 44 percent of its passenger traffic in&#13;
1993. The national network comprises about 54,000 km of main routes (Map IBRD&#13;
26327), and is administered by the Ministry of Railways (MOR) an organization of some&#13;
1,000 employees. In addition, provincial and local govemment entities administer 4,400&#13;
route-km of local railways (Tables 2.1-2.6).&#13;
2.2       Organization. MOR is headed by a minister who is assisted by three vice-&#13;
ministers, a chief dispatcher, a chief engineer and a chief economist (Chart 1). The&#13;
Chinese railway system has a workforce of about 3.4 million, 51 percent of whom are&#13;
engaged in rail transport. The remaining 49 percent work in nontransport activities:&#13;
17 percent in constructing railway infrastructure and facilities; 13 percent in manufacturing&#13;
locomotives, rolling stock, signaling, and communications equipment and other various&#13;
railway parts and components; 8 percent in the "diversified economy" which includes&#13;
thousands of small business ventures (DECOs); and 11 percent in other activities. Through&#13;
various measures MOR is expected to keep the number of employees constant over the&#13;
next several years.&#13;
2.3       The rail transport system is organized into 12 regional administrations. MOR&#13;
performs both regulatory and central transport management functions.  It is also&#13;
responsible for nontransport activities that include 35 factories, 20 construction companies,&#13;
7,000 DECOs, 4,700 hospitals and clinics, 11 universities, 14 research institutes, 140&#13;
technical schools plus numerous primary and secondary schools for the employees'&#13;
children. The railway is a relatively well-managed organization. It has a disciplined&#13;
workforce and the utilization rate of its track and equipment is among the world's highest:&#13;
in 1993, the railway's average wagon turnaround time was four days, and the density of&#13;
its freight and passenger traffic was about 29 million converted ton-km (ctkm) per route-&#13;
km (ctkmi are defined as equal to the sum of freight tkm and passenger-km, pkm) (Table&#13;
2.5).&#13;
2.4       Trafric and Bottlenecks.  Partly because of past underinvestment, rail&#13;
transport demand far exceeds supply. In 1993, freight traffic grew at 4.5 percent and&#13;
passenger traffic at 11.2 percent. Demand is projected to grow at similar rates through&#13;
the year 2000. Thus, present capacity is stretched to the limit. Although total length of&#13;
national and local railways are expected to increase to a total 70,000 km by 2000, capacity&#13;
constraints are projected to continue into the next century.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
2.5       Major bulk and semibulk commodities (such as coal, grains and construction&#13;
materials) account for about 75 percent of total freight (Tables 2.1 and 2.2). The&#13;
remaining 25 percent includes general merchandise and materials that can be moved in&#13;
containers, traffic that has been increasing each year and for which the railway faces&#13;
increasing competition from trucks. On average, roughly 20 percent of the railway&#13;
capacity is for passenger transport.&#13;
2.6       Faced with rapidly growing demand, the railway rationed services by&#13;
controlling wagon allocations to shippers and the number of train seats available for&#13;
passengers. For example, in 1990, on average more than 40 percent of monthly wagon&#13;
requests had to be denied. This inevitably led to higher operating costs for shippers who&#13;
must schedule their activities around the availability of transport services. Also, on&#13;
crowded routes, passenger trains compete for space with freight trains and are often&#13;
delayed because of conflicts with freight train schedules.&#13;
2.7       Outlook of Rail Transport Demand. Besides the possibility that railway&#13;
tariffs will increase, the next decade is likely to see highways, waterways, and civil&#13;
aviation mount increasing competition with the railway. Highway transport is expanding&#13;
rapidly with more high-quality roads and more modem trucks and buses that provide&#13;
competitive services over short to medium distances. Waterway transport is modernizing&#13;
to include container transport in the coastal and river delta areas to serve import and export&#13;
traffic. Air transport is growing fast, with more modem aircraft and the birth of regional&#13;
airlines to encourage competition. As a result, the railway is likely to lose market share:&#13;
some long-distance railway passengers will likely switch to civil aviation while others and&#13;
shippers of light manufactured products, usually shipped by rail over short to medium&#13;
distances, are likely to shift to highways and waterways, especially in coastal areas or&#13;
where modem highways run parallel to railways. Conversely, because of its low-cost&#13;
services for medium and long distances, the railway is likely to retain its competitive edge,&#13;
especially in long-distance bulk and semibulk freight transport as well as in long-distance&#13;
passenger transport. Taling these various factors into account, future railway transport&#13;
demand is forecast to be in the range of 4 to 6 percent per year for freight and 10 to&#13;
12 percent per year for passengers, according to the Bank's "China's Railway Strategy,'&#13;
prepared in close cooperation with MOR (Report No. 10592-CHA).&#13;
2.8       Investments. Railway investment in new or upgraded lines and transport&#13;
equipment is planned by MOR to rise (in current prices) to Y 350-400 billion in the 1996-&#13;
2000 period. This is a sharp rise from the Y 154 billion investment in the 1991-95 Eighth&#13;
Five-Year Plan (8FYP), and the Y 52 billion investment in the 1986-90 period (7FYP).&#13;
This substantial increase is due to the Government's recent focus on expanding China's&#13;
transportation infrastructure to handle the projected economic growth rate of 8 to 9 percent&#13;
per year through 2000. The main thrust will be to reduce bottlenecks in heavily trafficked&#13;
routes, and increase the carrying capacity of the coal routes from north China to the coastal&#13;
cities.&#13;
2.9       MOR/SPC and the Bank have had in the past several years a constructive&#13;
dialogue on expenditures for expanding capacity (mainly through the Railway Investment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
Study), developing cost-effective technologies, and maintaining track and equipment. This&#13;
dialogue is being strengthened under the proposed project.&#13;
B. RATIONALE FOR BANK INvOLvEmENT&#13;
2.10      The railway has as its objective to become a market-oriented, commercially-&#13;
operated entity. To give MOR a mandate, the State Council approved in April 1994 a 30-&#13;
Point Action Statement of Railway Reform prepared by MOR, which provides the railway&#13;
with a comprehensive agenda for this transformation. The Action Statement supports a 50-&#13;
Point Agenda of Nationwide Economic Reform promulgated by the Government at the 14th&#13;
National Congress in November 1993. [The 50-Point agenda aims to focus on enterprise&#13;
reform to support commercialization of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and participation&#13;
of the private sector; this adds to price reform, which is now several years into&#13;
implementation.] The Action Statement also conforms with the Bank's railway strategy&#13;
paper and the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) to be discussed at the Board in May 1995&#13;
in conjunction with this project. The CAS aims to assist China in alleviating infrastructure&#13;
bottlenecks, reforming SOEs, and safeguarding the environment.  Because the&#13;
implementation of the Action Statement's agenda will have far-reaching ramifications not&#13;
only for the railway but also for the economy, the restructuring of the railway into various&#13;
self-accounting profit centers must be determined with great care, as must the new&#13;
regulations and the relationship between the railway and Government.&#13;
2.11      Because of its limited familiarity with structures and operating practices of&#13;
market-economy railways, MOR has asked the Bank to assist it in implementing the initial&#13;
phase of the Action Statement through the proposed project. The Bank, given its extensive&#13;
experience with railway reforms in other countries and its familiarity with the railway, is&#13;
in a position to assist. Indeed, since 1984 the Bank has lent to China's railway sector $1.8&#13;
billion, through six national railway operations and one local railway operation (Annex 2!.&#13;
Railways I to V were mainly for physical investments, which were or are being&#13;
satisfactorily implemented. Furthermore, these loans supported MOR in undertaking&#13;
several studies to develop plans to modernize the railway's information systems and its&#13;
track and equipment technologies (Annex 3). Railways VI was designed as a transition&#13;
project with the aim of establishing a foundation for policy reform through studies and the&#13;
preparation of analytical tools.  Its tariff, accounting and railway management and&#13;
economic studies (covering, among other themes, the relationship between the Government&#13;
and MOR, restructuring of the railway, and railway financial resource mobilization) have&#13;
been completed or are near completion, a railway investment model and costing model&#13;
have been developed, and a pilot program to modernize rail container transportation has&#13;
been initiated (Annex 3). Railways VII builds on these studies, tools and pilot effort to&#13;
continue tariff reform, railway restructuring, strengthening of MOR's investment decisions&#13;
and their financing, and commercialization of container transport.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
C. REFORM CONStANSS AND 30-POINT ACnION STATEMENT&#13;
2.12      Although the railway is relatively well managed, it is still constrained in four&#13;
main areas:  (a) cumbersome regulations and government control over operations;&#13;
(b) command-economy organization and management; (c) inadequate capacity, investment&#13;
and finance; and (d) outdated technologies, operations and services. MOR has taken many&#13;
corrective steps in recent years (Annex 4), but much remains to be done. MOR's 30-Point&#13;
Action Statement describes a set of major objectives and many, but not all, of the required&#13;
actions to ameliorate these constraints.&#13;
2.13      Government-Railway Relationship and Railway Regulations. MOR, which&#13;
is part of the Government, exercises both regulatory and executive control over all aspects&#13;
of the railway's operations. Other government agencies also engage in the microcontrol&#13;
of selected key management decision-making. For example, the Ministry of Labor&#13;
approves the size of total compensation. The State Planning Commission (SPC) not only&#13;
approves tariffs but also assigns coal freight traffic quotas from three provinces that the&#13;
railway must meet, sometimes at tariffs below costs.  This is done without full&#13;
compensation; thus, the railway furnishes these services at a loss.&#13;
2.14      To tackle these problems, the 30-Point Action Statement proposes to:&#13;
(a) separate the roles of the Government and railway agencies-with the Government&#13;
limited to developing and implementing macroregulations (for example as related to&#13;
financial targets); (b) introduce compensation for public service obligations; and (c) create&#13;
an enabling environment, by amending the Railway Law, in which modern railway&#13;
enterprises can develop. Previous efforts have addressed some of these issues. These&#13;
included:&#13;
(a)  Forming an Economic Contract. In 1986, MOR entered into an economic&#13;
contract with the Government, which caused two major changes. First, the&#13;
MOR would receive no direct Govemment subsidies and finance all of its&#13;
operating expenditures and capital investments (through internally generated&#13;
funds and borrowings). Second, the contract offered incentives: the MOR's&#13;
total wage bill would be based on revenue per net tkm handled. This formula&#13;
encouraged the railways to increase total outputs as well as to control the size&#13;
of its workforce, but not to improve services, revenues and profits. In early&#13;
1994, the Government and MOR agreed to modify the contract to emphasize&#13;
financial results;&#13;
(b)  Eliminating Price Subsidies. Until 1990, the MOR enjoyed indirect input&#13;
price and loan rate subsidies from the Government equal to 20 to 25 percent&#13;
of its total expenses for materials, fuel and electricity, because it bought a&#13;
portion of these items at less-than-market prices. In 1990, prices were&#13;
permitted to gradually rise to market levels and by late 1993, all price and&#13;
loan rate subsidies were eliminated;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
(c)  Enacting a Railway Law. In 1991, China's first Railway Law was enacted&#13;
to provide a framework for regulating the railway's activities and establishing&#13;
the rights and responsibilities of the various levels of govemment, MOR, its&#13;
12 administrations, and the public. However, several provisions in the 1991&#13;
Law do not conform with MOR's 30-Point Action Statement (such as the&#13;
principle of separating MOR's operating and regulatory functions). Thus, the&#13;
Law needs to be amended, and MOR has asked the Bank for assistance in&#13;
drafting revisions.&#13;
2.15      Organization and Management. The 12 railway administrations are subject&#13;
to MOR's central planning and control-although, since 1990, a series of incremental&#13;
reforms have been introduced to give the administrations a modest increase in autonomy.&#13;
As of 1994, the administrations were: (a) managing small-scale investment projects;&#13;
(b) retaining profits from local transport (shipments that originated and terminated within&#13;
the administration); and (c) deciding on their internal organizational structure, staff size&#13;
and composition, and distribution of pay incentives.&#13;
2.16      Until now, the railway's objective was to maximize the physical transport of&#13;
freight and passengers; its services have not been organized by line of business and its&#13;
compensation systems have not focused on increasing revenues and profits. Also, it does&#13;
not have management information systems (MISs) that are suitable for managing its&#13;
transport operations by line of business or its nontransport operations in a Socialist market&#13;
economy. In addition, its nontransport manufacturing and diversified economy activities&#13;
need to be restructured to compete effectively in a Socialist market economy and to take&#13;
advantage of economies of scale. Finally, like other SOEs, the railway has to shoulder the&#13;
burden of providing welfare services (housing, pensions, health and education) to its staff.&#13;
2.17      To deal with these issues, the Action Statement proposes to: (a) increase the&#13;
autonomy of the administrations and subadministrations; (b) form various profit-oriented&#13;
transport enterprises organized along lines of business (for example, systemwide companies&#13;
that provide specialized interregional transport services such as hauling containers);&#13;
(c) allow these enterprises to interact through arms-length commercial relationships, such&#13;
as operating and lease agreements; (d) regroup the equipment manufacturing companies to&#13;
achieve competition and economies of specialization; (e) expose railway construction&#13;
companies to international competitive bidding; (f) rationalize the diversified-economy&#13;
companies; (g) divest the railway of its social welfare responsibilities; and (h) improve the&#13;
staff compensation and manpower planning systems. Past efforts in these areas include:&#13;
(a)  Initiating Pilot Reform Programs. MOR began experimenting with railway&#13;
restructuring and enterprise reform by setting up pilot programs aimed at&#13;
evaluating "line-of-business" organizations for selected railway lines and&#13;
subunits of regional administrations. These included (i) two railway lines&#13;
(Datong-Qinhuangdao and Guangzhou-Shenzhen); (ii) two subadministrations&#13;
(Fuzhou and Jinan), and (iii) one administration (Guangzhou). Technical&#13;
assistance for some of these programs, which was started under Railways VI,&#13;
would be supported under Railways VII also;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
(b)  Increasing Labor Productivity. MOR decided to control the size of its&#13;
workforce by (i) minimizing the staffing for new lines; (ii) penalizing&#13;
managers for exceeding targeted staffing levels; (iii) reducing management in&#13;
the administrations and MOR by 15 to 20 percent; and (iv) hiring almost all&#13;
new employees on a contract, rather than lifetime, basis. These programs&#13;
would be supported under Railways VII;&#13;
(c)  Refocusing the Diversified-Economy Program.   MOR  resolved to&#13;
(i) separate the management of diversified-economy companies (DECOs) from&#13;
that of rail transport; and (ii) expand the scope of its DECOs, which currently&#13;
are profitable, to absorb additional redundant transport employees, from the&#13;
present 200,000 to 400,000 by the year 2000.&#13;
2.18      MOR has not yet resolved, in its 30-Point Action Statement, the functions and&#13;
organizational relationships of a possible central transportation management entity. This&#13;
entity would assume network responsibility for overseeing (a) empty wagon distribution;&#13;
(b) power assignments of through locomotives; and (c) day-to-day modifications of through&#13;
train schedules. This is a difficult issue. Based on the experience of other freight-oriented&#13;
railways in developed-market economies, there are inherent efficiencies in centralized&#13;
management of trains, locomotive and freight wagons. However, strong political pressures&#13;
persist in China to decentralize transportation decision-making to the administrations and&#13;
subadministrations. MOR has asked the Bank to help resolve this issue under Railways&#13;
VII.&#13;
2.19      Transport Capacity Investments and Fmancial Management. The Chinese&#13;
railway system has chronically lacked the capacity to adequately support rapid economic&#13;
growth. In addition, the current expansion program may not close more than 75 percent&#13;
of the anticipated gap between transport demand and supply in 2000. This is partly due&#13;
to MOR not regularly applying modern investment and financial planning tools to optimize&#13;
the location, scale and timing of railway investments or to forecast its long-term needs for&#13;
investments, borrowings and increases in tariffs and surcharges. Another reason is that&#13;
the railway just began to adopt modern, cost-effective track and equipment technologies&#13;
(such as using trains with a high ratio of payload to tare weight) to expand its capacity with&#13;
less investment. Further, the railway has limited experience in raising capital and&#13;
managing assets and liabilities.  Last, it is not familiar with commercial practices&#13;
commonly followed in market economies such as operational logistics and contract tariff&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
2.20      To remedy these deficiencies, MOR's Action Statement proposes to:&#13;
(a) employ modern investment and financial planning tools; (b) adopt more cost-effective&#13;
technologies; (c) attract private sector funds to railway enterprises through both debt and&#13;
equity financing; and (d) improve pricing-for example, by initiating congestion and&#13;
contract pricing. Some changes were already introduced:&#13;
(a)  Applying Investment Planning Tools. In 1992, MOR applied the decision-&#13;
support system it developed under the Bank-supported Railway Investment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Study (RIS) to (i) determine priorities of railway investment projects, and&#13;
(ii) support the Government's decision to augment railway investment.&#13;
Further applications would be carried out under Railways VII;&#13;
(b)  Involving Foreign Investors. In 1992, new policies were issued to encourage&#13;
some of MOR's nonrail entities to raise capital by creating joint ventures with&#13;
private foreign investors. In 1994, a joint venture (with 25 percent foreign&#13;
equity) was created to build and operate a new local railway line between&#13;
Jinhua and Wenzhou (330 km);&#13;
(c)  Expanding Capacity More Efficiently. In 1994, MOR decided to implement&#13;
recommendations of the Bank-supported Cost-Effective Technology Evaluation&#13;
(CETE) study to expand railway capacity at significantly lower costs, notably&#13;
by raising wagon axle loads from 21 tons to 25 tons in heavily trafficked&#13;
corridors;&#13;
(d)  Introducing New Types of Tariffs. From 1993 to 1994, MOR received&#13;
permission from the State Pricing Bureau (SPB) to introduce special tariffs,&#13;
such as extra charges for congested passenger lines, higher tariffs for new&#13;
lines, contract prices for oversized or extraheavy freight loads, and passenger&#13;
fare surcharges for higher quality services. Some of these tariff initiatives&#13;
would be supported under Railways VII.&#13;
2.21      Technology, Operations and Services. Although the railway utilizes its&#13;
physical assets intensively, much of its technology is outdated and not always cost-&#13;
effective. For example, although they are being phased out, some 35 percent of the&#13;
railway's locomotives were steam-powered at end-1993. Also, the top-down approach to&#13;
transport planning, combined with shortages of freight wagons, means shippers wait from&#13;
20 to 50 days to receive a wagon. This standard of service would be unacceptable in&#13;
virtually all market economies.&#13;
2.22      To correct these problems, the Action Statement proposes to: (a) upgrade&#13;
railway track and equipment technologies; (b) develop a more dynamic wagon distribution&#13;
planning system; (c) adopt modem management practices to improve the use of track and&#13;
equipment and the productivity of labor (using service as a criterion for rewarding staff&#13;
performance); and (d) install modern management information systems to improve&#13;
customer services. Changes already introduced include the following:&#13;
(a)  Modernizing Track, Equipment, and Telecommunications Technologies.&#13;
During 1988 to 1992, MOR conducted Bank-supported studies to modernize&#13;
the maintenance of railway track and transport equipment, upgrade the&#13;
telecommunications system, and apply new electrification technologies. Many&#13;
recommendations from these studies are being implemented;&#13;
(b)  Introducing Modern Information Systems. In 1992, MOR embarked on two&#13;
complementary programs: (i) it installed a digital packet-switch telecommuni-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
cations network and (ii) it initiated the replacement of the hierarchical wagon-&#13;
tracing system with a modem, computer-based transport management&#13;
information system (TMIS). When fully implemented in 1997, the TMIS will&#13;
provide the tools to decrease shippers' waiting times through better distribution&#13;
of empty wagons. It will also permit transport managers to monitor and&#13;
control the movement of trains, wagons, locomotives and containers on a&#13;
network basis. This work would be continued under Railways VII;&#13;
(c) Adopting Customer-Responsive Operating Practices. In 1993, MOR&#13;
launched a Bank-assisted pilot program to provide container transport services&#13;
that used unit trains running at passenger-train speeds north-to-south between&#13;
Harbin and Guangzhou and east-to-west between Shanghai and Xian. This&#13;
work would be extended under Railways VII.&#13;
2.23      The process of railway reform outlined above is expected to be difficult,&#13;
lengthy and uneven because of: (a) the size and complexity of the railway system; (b) the&#13;
reluctance of some government agencies and some railway management to relinquish their&#13;
miicrocontrol over the railway; and (c) the ramifications to the entire economy of any&#13;
changes to the railway in structure, staffing and pricing.  For these reasons, the&#13;
Government and MOR are following a cautious, gradual approach in testing reform&#13;
initiatives in pilot experiments, which the Bank considers appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. OBJEcTrES&#13;
3.1       The proposed project is to support MOR's initial efforts to implement its&#13;
30-Point Action Statement of Railway Reform. The project's main objectives are to assist&#13;
MOR: (a) redefine the relationship between the railway and the Government; (b) reshape&#13;
the railway's organization and strengthen its internal management; (c) expand the railway's&#13;
transport capacity, raise its investment efficiency, and enhance its finances; and&#13;
(d) modernize the railway's technologies and bolster the efficiency and quality of its&#13;
transport operations and service. To achieve these objectives, MOR formulated a series&#13;
of components on policy reform and institutional development (PID), investments, and&#13;
studies (Sections C-E below).&#13;
B. LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
3.2       The project draws on lessons learned from Railways I to VI, and railway&#13;
projects in other developed and developing countries. First, MOR wants to learn new&#13;
skills from abroad and prepare its own projects, with Bank assistance; it hires foreign&#13;
specialists only when absolutely necessary. This approach has generally created a sense&#13;
of ownership, but learning by doing has sometimes delayed project preparation and&#13;
implementation. Thus, to assist MOR at the earlier stage of reform, the Bank has provided&#13;
it in the past five years with extensive technical assistance (TA) financed by grants of about&#13;
$3 million under the Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) Fund. This&#13;
source of TA funding, however, is less likely to be forthcoming in future. To avoid delays&#13;
in implementing reform under the proposed project, MOR agreed to undertake more TA&#13;
with its own funding including that from Bank loans.&#13;
3.3       Second, railway reform is slow due to the railway's lack of authority over&#13;
rates, its lack of a commercial approach to the transport market, and resistance to change&#13;
on the part of railway management and government institutions. Railways VII would also&#13;
face these issues. Third, excessive reliance on loan covenants to achieve reform objectives&#13;
is unrealistic. As the Bank enjoys a constructive dialogue with MOR, loan covenants have&#13;
been kept to a minimum under this project. Fourth, it is advantageous to begin making&#13;
advance procurement arrangements long before the loan becomes effective, have a well-&#13;
prepared implementation plan, and develop a system for monitoring the performance of the&#13;
project-financed investments.&#13;
3.4       Furthermore, MOR's reform agenda is broadly consistent with lessons from&#13;
railway reform in developed market economies (World Bank Discussion Paper No. 269).&#13;
First, there should be clear separation between the role of the Government and the role of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
the railway, and between market-driven activities and public-service-obligation activities.&#13;
Second, railway organizations should be designed along lines of business, with clear&#13;
financial goals (rather than physical output targets), adequate compensation for public&#13;
service obligations, and sufficient authority in tariff setting. Third, major barriers such&#13;
as excessive redundant labor and employee welfare obligations should be removed.&#13;
C. POLICY REFORM AND INSTITONAL DEVELOPMENT INrITATIvEs&#13;
3.5       PID components would provide MOR with the TA to implement three elements&#13;
of its 30-Point Action Statement: (a) railway enterprise reform, (b) railway tariff reform,&#13;
and (c) labor productivity enhancement.&#13;
3.6       Railway Enterprise Reform. This component would support MOR's initial&#13;
efforts to transform the railway into a group of geographically-based enterprises and&#13;
systemwide, line-of-business specialized transport service companies. Specifically, it&#13;
would help MOR: (a) prepare recommendations for improving the legal and regulatory&#13;
framework so as to create an enabling environment for market-oriented railway enterprises&#13;
to function; (b) undertake experimental programs of railway enterprise reform [including&#13;
the proposed restructuring of the Fuzhou Subadministration (FSA) and the Guangzhou&#13;
Railway Group Corporation (GRC)]; and, based on lessons learned from these&#13;
experiments, prepare a comprehensive plan for railway restructuring; and (c) prepare a&#13;
debt and equity financing strategy for selected railway services.&#13;
3.7       Railway Tariff Reform. This component would assist MOR in improving&#13;
railway tariffs further, by: (a) justifying tariff adjustments on a cost recovery basis (using&#13;
a costing model and a cost-index system to gear tariffs to price and productivity changes);&#13;
(b) pilot-testing contract pricing to increase flexibility in tariff setting; and (c) further&#13;
experimenting with passenger congestion pricing.&#13;
3.8       Labor Productivity Enhancement.  This component would help MOR&#13;
undertake measures to control the size of its workforce and boost labor productivity-by&#13;
reducing management overlap, increasing contract employment, linking capital budgeting&#13;
to human resources planning, transferring redundant staff to new diversified economy&#13;
companies and adopting new labor productivity and service-quality methods.&#13;
3.9       Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Borrower, through MOR, will&#13;
carry out the PID components in accordance with action plans acceptable to the Bank&#13;
(para. 6.la, Annex 6).&#13;
D. INVESTMENTS FOR EXPANSION, MODERNIZATION AND REFORM&#13;
3.10      The proposed six investment components would finance equipment, materials&#13;
and TA for MOR to expand, modernize and reform the railway system. They have been&#13;
accorded top priority by MOR, either because of their economic returns or because of their&#13;
strategic importance to railway modernization. Their technical designs are based on results&#13;
of various technological studies under Railways IV and V. Indicators has been developed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
for monitoring the effectiveness of the investment components (Annex 5). The components&#13;
are:&#13;
3.11      Expanding Corridor Capacity. Financing would be provided for electrifying&#13;
and upgrading the 1,044-km Wuhan-Guangzhou line (the last remaining section of the&#13;
Beijing-Guangzhou trunk line to be electrified and modernized). The line represents only&#13;
4 percent of the total network but carries 15 percent of total traffic. Traffic volumes have&#13;
been increasing at about 14 percent per year since 1990 compared to the railway's national&#13;
average of about 9 percent.&#13;
3.12      The proposed electrification and upgrading would enable the line to&#13;
accommodate longer and heavier trains, consistent with MOR's decision to raise the axle&#13;
load from 21 tons to 25 tons for its core network. Its main design features are: (a) 1,050-&#13;
meter siding lengths, (b) 25 kV/50 Hz electrification, (c) 110 kV power supply with&#13;
improvements to the related power supply and distribution system, (d) upgraded signaling&#13;
and telecommunication systems, (e) reconstructed bridges and tunnels, and (t) upgraded&#13;
maintenance depot shops. The technical design conforms with recommendations of the&#13;
Electrification Technology Study under Railways V.&#13;
3.13      The construction would produce economic benefits mainly as savings in rail&#13;
operating costs. It would also have environmental benefits, particularly as it would:&#13;
(a) eliminate the concentrations of particulates and carbon monoxide emitted by diesel&#13;
engines in built-up areas; and (b) reduce soil contamination caused by the spills of diesel&#13;
fuel and lube oil. The electric power would come mainly from large coal-burning plants,&#13;
and to a lesser extent from hydropower plants, which serve general users, of which the&#13;
railway use would represent less than 3 percent of total power consumption (Annex 8).&#13;
Because large thermal plants control pollution more efficiently and hydro plants create no&#13;
air pollution, the switch from diesel to electric locomotives would reduce net emissions of&#13;
air pollutants.&#13;
3.14      To allay the Bank's concern over shortages of electricity, SPC has written to&#13;
the Bank that power supply would be adequate for the electrified line, and that MOR&#13;
would have priority, if necessary.&#13;
3.15      Modernizing Information Systems.  Financing would be provided for&#13;
acquiring computer hardware, software and related TA needed for: (a) the first phase of&#13;
a computer-based management information system (MIS); (b) integrated TMIS for major&#13;
marshalling yards, subadministrations and administrations; (c) a pilot passenger&#13;
reservations system in one administration; and (d) management of funds under the treasury&#13;
functions. This technology would help railway managers make better-informed decisions&#13;
and improve railway operating efficiency and service quality.&#13;
3.16      Upgrading Telecommunications Systems. Financing would be provided for&#13;
acquiring telecommunications equipment and related TA, including fiber-optic cables and&#13;
digital microwave equipment, to enable MOR to expand and modernize the railway's trunk&#13;
transmission and data telecommunications networks. This would be part of the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
ongoing effort to help MOR implement the railway's Telecommunications Master Plan.&#13;
Specifically, the component would provide financing for: (a) expanding and digitalizing&#13;
the railway's long-distance transmission network; (b) expanding the data communications&#13;
network; (c) developing a video conference network, with a terminal for each&#13;
subadministration; and (d) setting up a telecommunications network management system.&#13;
3.17      Commercializing Container Transport. Financing would be provided for&#13;
purchasing container transport and handling equipment (e.g., rubber-tired gantry cranes,&#13;
forklift container handlers, and highway tractors) and the TA and computer software&#13;
needed to modernize and commercialize rail-based container transport operations. MOR&#13;
would lease the equipment on commercial terms to at least two container transport&#13;
corporations, which are expected to be: (a) the Chinese Railway Container (CRC)&#13;
Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MOR; and (b) the SinoRails Intermodal Transport&#13;
(SIT) Company, a joint venture among MOR, China Ocean Shipping Group Company&#13;
(COSCO), and Sinotrans (a freight forwarder). Both corporations would be authorized to&#13;
operate on any railway route and serve both domestic and foreign traffic as long as line&#13;
capacity is available and the operations are profitable.&#13;
3.18      CRC and SIT would become prototypes of self-accounting enterprises that&#13;
provide interregional, specialized rail-based transport services on a commercial basis.&#13;
More specifically, the component would: (a) serve as pilot programs for MOR to test&#13;
various aspects of railway enterprise reform; and (b) offer landlocked provinces access to&#13;
international trade by providing them with fast and reliable transport service for high-value&#13;
products to major seaports.&#13;
3.19      Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Borrower, through MOR, will:&#13;
(a) select at least two container transport companies acceptable to the Bank to which the&#13;
container transport and handling equipment to be procured under the project shall be&#13;
leased, (b) employ consultants with terms of reference, qualifications and experience&#13;
acceptable to the Bank to assist it in the preparation of contractual agreements between&#13;
the Borrower and said container transport companies required for the leasing and&#13;
operation of said equipment on a commercial basis; (c) furnish said agreements to the Bank&#13;
promptly upon their preparation and afford the Bank a reasonable opportunity to exchange&#13;
views with the Borrower thereon; (d) thereafter, take all measures required on its part to&#13;
conclude said agreements with said container transport companies, taking into account the&#13;
views of the Bank on the matter; and (e) ensure that no invitations to bid for contracts for&#13;
container transport and handling equipment included in the project shall be issued unless&#13;
and until the Borrower shall have concluded the agreements referred to in item (d) above&#13;
(para. 6.lb).&#13;
3.20      Enhancing Environmental Protection. Railway environmental protection has&#13;
historically received low priority because MOR has primarily focused on transportation.&#13;
However, it now recognizes that to protect the environment over the long term, it must&#13;
develop a comprehensive environmental strategy and strengthen its Environmental&#13;
Protection Bureau. This component would finance the TA and equipment for MOR to:&#13;
(a) undertake pilot programs to address pressing environmental problems; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
(b) strengthen the capabilities of its environmental staff. These initiatives are consistent&#13;
with the comprehensive long-term environmental strategy being prepared under Railways&#13;
VI.&#13;
3.21      The pilot programs would involve: (a) testing noise barriers along a rail line&#13;
traversing urban Beijing; (b) developing a solid waste management strategy for the&#13;
Shenyang station; (c) assessing techniques for cleaning up contaminated soil at the Taopu&#13;
freight yard; (d) treating oily wastewater at a locomotive depot; (e) upgrading the Beijing&#13;
Anti-Epidemic Center; (f) developing locomotive and factory noise abatement programs;&#13;
(g) training railway environmental staff in advanced environmental impact assessment&#13;
techniques; (h) developing a fuel additive for diesel locomotives to boost combustion and&#13;
reduce emissions; and (i) preparing an environmentally-sound strategy to dispose of more&#13;
than 1 million styrofoam lunch boxes per day.&#13;
3.22      Expanding System Capacity. This component would support MOR's initial&#13;
effort in its long-term plan to introduce heavy-haul operations-employing heavier trains&#13;
with a higher ratio of payload to tare weight-to the core network. Financing would be&#13;
provided for procuring three-phase AC electric locomotives, including equipment, tools,&#13;
spare parts and training, and securing heavy-haul expertise to help MOR raise the axle load&#13;
limit on the core network from 21 to 25 tons. The acquisition of these locomotives would&#13;
involve importing fully-assembled locomotives and transferring technology for locomotive&#13;
manufacture from a foreign locomotive builder to China (to be financed separately by&#13;
MOR). This transfer would be either to a joint-venture manufacturer or to one of China's&#13;
two electric locomotive works. The first use of AC electric locomotives would be on the&#13;
heavy-traffic, 269-km single-track section between Baoji and Yangpingguan. This section,&#13;
which is part of the Baoji-Chengdu main line, has gradients up to 3 percent.&#13;
3.23      The investment would reduce operating and maintenance costs and increase&#13;
throughput capacity of congested main lines through the use of more powerful electric&#13;
locomotives to pull the heavier freight trains. The investment would also contribute to&#13;
MOR's strategy to: (a) develop for eventual manufacture in China a new generation of&#13;
electric locomotives required on other electrified, high-volume main lines; and (b) upgrade&#13;
the quality of its locomotive manufacturing, which would be an element of a study&#13;
component under the proposed project.&#13;
3.24      The Borrower, through MOR, plans to implement the investment components&#13;
according to the implementation schedule given in Table 3.9.&#13;
E. STUDIES FOR MODERNIZATION AND REFORM&#13;
3.25      The following study components would provide MOR with the TA and&#13;
software needed to prepare future railway projects or to develop and apply new railway&#13;
technologies and management techniques.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
3.26      Feasibility Study of Dedicated Passenger Rail. Foreign experts and training&#13;
of MOR staff would be provided for the purpose of: (a) forecasting ridership on the new&#13;
dedicated passenger rail line between Beijing and Shanghai and its competing modes;&#13;
(b) comparing the life-cycle costs of the dedicated passenger rail line with those of other&#13;
modes for different market segments; (c) assessing the economic, financial and technical&#13;
feasibility of the line; and (d) optimizing the line's engineering and operating parameters&#13;
(such as station spacings, train size, train speeds and operating patterns).&#13;
3.27      Application of the RIS Decision Support System. Expertise and computer&#13;
software would be provided for helping MOR: (a) refine the decision support system&#13;
developed under the Railway Investment Study (RIS) to make it more realistic; (b) develop&#13;
and apply a new, fast-response model to help MOR optimize railway investment programs&#13;
through 2005 under anticipated budget constraints (this would replace the existing trial-and-&#13;
error procedure); and (c) apply the RIS system to determine the economic priority of the&#13;
proposed dedicated passenger line relative to other major railway projects.&#13;
3.28      To strengthen the dialogue between the Government and the Bank on railway&#13;
investment planning, MOR plans to apply appropriate methodologies (including the RIS&#13;
system) and criteria to evaluate the proposed railway investments. The results of the&#13;
evaluation would be presented in a report to be discussed by MOR and the Bank at the&#13;
mid-term review. To make the review manageable, the evaluation would focus only on&#13;
a few most important questions, in particular, those related to the adequacy of the&#13;
investment programs for capacity expansion, maintenance and rehabilitation, and&#13;
technological upgrading.&#13;
3.29      Information Systems Studies. TA would be provided to MOR for conducting&#13;
studies to: (a) develop a marketing information system built on a systemwide waybill file;&#13;
(b) prepare plans for expanding TMIS beyond 1997; and (c) conduct feasibility studies for&#13;
new operating information systems, including one for locomotive and rolling stock&#13;
maintenance and a material stock control system.&#13;
3.30      Telecommunications Network Systems Study. MOR would receive TA and&#13;
training for undertaking a study on network management and optimization, to monitor the&#13;
performance and improve the reliability of the railway telecommunications network.&#13;
3.31      Diesel Engine Design.  Financing would be provided to MOR  for:&#13;
(a) acquiring the expertise needed to design high-efficiency, high-power, low-emissions&#13;
diesel engines for heavy-haul freight operations and higher-speed, higher-capacity&#13;
passenger services; and (b) importing the critical parts needed to develop a prototype&#13;
engine.&#13;
3.32      Restructuring the Railway's Manufacturing and Overhaul Sector. MOR&#13;
would obtain TA to prepare an action plan to restructure and modernize the railway&#13;
manufacture and overhaul sector. The restructuring part of the proposed TA would deal&#13;
with (a) rationalizing MOR's 35 factories into appropriate groups of companies, to strike&#13;
a better balance between specialization and competition; and (b) forming joint ventures to&#13;
transfer management expertise and manufacturing technologies to the railway. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
modernization part would deal with upgrading the quality of railway equipment&#13;
manufacturing to international standards.&#13;
3.33      Strengthening MOR's Treasury Functions. Foreign experts and training of&#13;
MOR staff would be provided for the purpose of: (a) strengthening its treasury functions,&#13;
and (b) establishing a framework for issuing railway bonds.&#13;
3.34      Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Borrower, through MOR, will&#13;
(a) undertake the studies summarized above according to action plans acceptable to the&#13;
Bank (Annex 7J, (b) exchange views with the Bank on the studies' recommendations; and&#13;
(c) implement the recommendations taking into account the Bank's comments (para. 6. 1c).&#13;
F. COST ESTIMATES&#13;
3.35      The project is estimated to cost $1.75 billion, including physical and price&#13;
contingencies (see Tables 3.1-3.8 and the cost summary table below). The foreign&#13;
exchange costs of the project are estimated at $619.9 million, representing about&#13;
35 percent of project costs. Base costs were originally estimated at January 1994 prices;&#13;
they have been adjusted to January 1995 prices. Physical contingencies are calculated at&#13;
10 percent of the base costs of civil works and 5 percent of the base cost of equipment&#13;
(7 percent for the container transport component). Price contingencies were calculated&#13;
both for foreign and local costs according to Bank guidelines, for each year from 1995 to&#13;
2002, when expressed in US dollars: 1.5, 1.8, 2.6, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5, and 2.5 percent;&#13;
and when expressed in Yuan: 14.0, 10.5, 8.5, 7.0, 6.5, 6.2, 6.2, and 6.2 percent. The&#13;
exchange rate of Y 8.7 to the US dollar was used for converting foreign exchange costs.&#13;
MOR is currently exempt from import taxes, customs duties and local taxes, but will be&#13;
subject to import taxes from 1996 onward. Identifiable taxes and duties amount to about&#13;
$130 million equivalent. The costs of the goods financed under this project were estimated&#13;
on the basis of unit costs of similar equipment, machinery and materials procured in 1993.&#13;
The costs of TA and training were based on current average fees per month in China and&#13;
on current costs for travel and subsistence for foreign consultants.&#13;

3.36            The accuracy of cost estimates for the proposed corridor expansion was&#13;
difficult to assess because the Bank received insufficient details on the goods and labor to&#13;
be funded domestically. To address the Bank's concern, MOR provided the Bank with&#13;
cost estimates for the preliminary and final designs, which differ by less than 3 percent.&#13;
G. FINANCING&#13;
3.37            A Bank loan of $400 million would be made to the People's Republic of&#13;
China, representing about 23 percent of total project costs and almost 65 percent of the&#13;
foreign costs. MOF would allocate the funds to MOR. MOR would cover the remaining&#13;
costs and, if needed, local cost overruns, including contingencies. MOR does not&#13;
capitalize interest expenses during construction, and interest expenses relating to&#13;
implementation would be covered by its operating revenues. MOF would allocate the loan&#13;
proceeds to MOR on the same terms as those of the Bank loan, with MOR bearing the&#13;
foreign exchange risk.&#13;

3.38      Implementation of the investment components depends on availability of&#13;
counterpart funds, which became an issue in 1993 when local funds originally allotted to&#13;
Railways VI were temporarily diverted to another project, thereby delaying Railways VI.&#13;
This implementation risk would be mitigated by MOF's newly issued policy that ensures&#13;
the availability of counterpart funds up front.&#13;
H. IMPLEMENTATioN AND RLsKs&#13;
3.39      MOR, through its Foreign Capital and Technical Import Office (FCTIO),&#13;
would be the executing agency responsible overall for implementing the project under&#13;
similar arrangements to those for the previous loans. Procurement of goods under&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) would be handled by tendering companies&#13;
appointed by MOR. The acquisition of TA, training, computer software, and equipment&#13;
would be handled by MOR with consultants' help as needed.&#13;
3.40      Preparation of general, commercial and technical specifications has already&#13;
begun with the intention to complete the bidding process for procurement in 1995 and to&#13;
have contracts signed when the loan becomes effective. Implementation is expected to&#13;
spread over six years. The project would be completed by December 31, 2001 and closed&#13;
by December 31, 2002 (Table 3.9-Implementation Schedule).&#13;
3.41      The physical investments in the proposed project pose minimal risks in view&#13;
of the railway's past experience in implementing such components. The risks relate to the&#13;
policy reform component because of MOR's lack of familiarity with reform and its&#13;
dependence on endorsement from core government agencies in undertaking reform&#13;
initiatives. However, the Government and MOR are committed to reform, and are clearly&#13;
moving in the right direction. The risk would be reduced by a continuous dialogue among&#13;
MOR, other Govemment agencies, and the Bank on the substance and timing of reforms,&#13;
by funding TA and training for sector policy reform, and by intense Bank supervision of&#13;
the project. Additionally:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
(a)  MOR has prepared action plans for the various technical assistance programs&#13;
under the proposed project; and&#13;
(b) the government agencies concerned, especially SPC, plan to give top priority&#13;
to supporting MOR in undertaking reform initiatives proposed under the&#13;
project.&#13;
I. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.42      Except as noted, all Bank-financed goods would be procured under ICB,&#13;
according to the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits&#13;
dated May 1992. The bidding documents would conform with model documents prepared&#13;
by the Government based on the Bank's standard bidding documents. Contracts worth&#13;
$200,000 or less each and totaling no more than $10 million may be purchased by either&#13;
local or international shopping, based on at least three quotations from potential suppliers.&#13;
Contracts valued at $500,000 or less each and totaling no more than $20 million may be&#13;
procured by Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) according to procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank (see the procurement summary table below). Contracts for goods above the threshold&#13;
of $2 million would be subject to the Bank's prior review procedures. In bid evaluation&#13;
under ICB, Chinese manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin over the CIF&#13;
costs of competing imports equal to the lesser of 15 percent or customs duties and local&#13;
taxes MOR would have to pay (expressed as a percentage of the CIF costs).&#13;

3.43     The three-phase AC locomotives for $100 million equivalent would be&#13;
procured by Limited Intemational Bidding (LIB) from reputable electric locomotive&#13;
builders in the world. The bids would be evaluated on the basis of criteria that conform&#13;
with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement dated May 1992; a margin of preference,&#13;
however, would not be applicable. Bidders would be requested to quote for transfer of&#13;
technology, although this would not be financed by the Bank. The bidding process would&#13;
be subject to the Bank's prior review.&#13;
3.44     Bank-financed consulting services would be provided by qualified consultants&#13;
appointed according to the Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants dated August 1981.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
The Bank's prior review would be required for all contracts over $100,000 for consulting&#13;
firms and $50,000 for individual consultants, all single-source contracts, and terms of&#13;
reference for all contracts.&#13;
3.45      Items not financed by the Bank-including civil works, miscellaneous local&#13;
materials and equipment-would be procured according to Chinese government procedures.&#13;
J. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.46      Disbursements under Bank financing would be for: (a) 100 percent of the&#13;
foreign expenditures for imported goods; (b) 100 percent of the local expenditures&#13;
(ex-factory costs) for goods purchased direct from factories; (c) 75 percent of the local&#13;
expenditures for other goods procured locally; and (d) 100 percent of the costs of services.&#13;
Domestic transport costs from the border, a port or factory would not be eligible for Bank&#13;
financing.&#13;
3.47      Disbursements against contracts for goods valued less than $2 million each,&#13;
consulting contracts valued less than $100,000 each for firms and $50,000 each for&#13;
individuals, and expenses on training and study tours would be made on the basis of&#13;
Statements of Expenditure. To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account would be&#13;
established with an authorized allocation of $20 million representing about four months of&#13;
expected expenditures on average. Replenishment would be made monthly or whenever&#13;
the Special Account is drawn down by 50 percent of its initial deposit, whichever occurs&#13;
first. Documentation supporting Statements of Expenditure would not be submitted to the&#13;
Bank, but would be kept in MOR's project office in Beijing and made available for review&#13;
by the Bank's supervision missions.&#13;
3.48      Disbursement projections (Table 3.10) assume that the loan would become&#13;
effective by September 1, 1995 and be fully disbursed by December 31, 2002. The&#13;
projections are conservative with regard to the positive effects of advance procurement&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
K. MONrrORING, EvALUATION AND SUPERVISION&#13;
3.49      Monitoring. To monitor the progress and effectiveness of implementation,&#13;
MOR would provide the Bank with periodic reports during each year of project&#13;
implementation (beginning with the year after loan effectiveness) on:&#13;
(a)  Audits of the Project Accounts, the Special Account, the Statements of&#13;
Expenditure, and the consolidated financial statements for the railway, CRC&#13;
and SIT by end-June;&#13;
(b)  The status of implementation for each PID component with respect to the&#13;
target dates shown in Annex 6 by the end of June and December;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
(c)  The status of implementation for each investment component as specified in&#13;
the implementation schedule (Table 3.9) by the end of April, July, October&#13;
and January;&#13;
(d)  The performance of each investment component relative to the indicators&#13;
described in Annex 5 during the period of operation by end-March;&#13;
(e)  The status of resettlement under the corridor expansion component by the end&#13;
of March;&#13;
(f)  The results of resettlement monitoring and evaluation and environmental&#13;
impact mitigation for the corridor expansion component by end-March.&#13;
3.50      Mid-term Review. Given the complexity of the project, agreement was&#13;
reached at negotiations that the Borrower, through MOR, will undertake, jointly with the&#13;
Bank, a mid-term review ofproject implementation no later than November 30, 1998 (para.&#13;
6.1d).&#13;
3.51      Supervision. Two Bank supervision missions per year are planned, but more&#13;
missions may be needed depending on implementation progress. Because of its size and&#13;
complexity, the project would require above-average supervision staff-weeks, especially&#13;
in the first two to three years of implementation involving the PID components. Over the&#13;
project's six-year implementation period, the supervision staff time is estimated to total&#13;
about 94 staff-weeks or average about 13 staff-weeks per year (Annex 10). This estimate&#13;
incorporates staff-week savings expected from combining the supervision of this and other&#13;
railway projects in China. MOR would submit a Project Completion Report to the Bank&#13;
six months after loan closing.&#13;
L. ENVIRONMENTAL IMACS AND RESETELEMENT&#13;
3.52      Envirommental Impacts.  This is a Category B project. The proposed&#13;
Wuhan-Guangzhou electrification and upgrading has an impact on resettlement; none of&#13;
the investment components would significantly harm the environment.  In fact, the&#13;
electrification would reduce air pollution and soil contamination by diesel fuel and lube oil.&#13;
Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Borrower, through MOR, will carry out&#13;
the project according to health, safety, and environmental standards acceptable to the Bank&#13;
(Annex 8; para. 6. le). The pilot environmental protection programs would acquaint MOR&#13;
with up-to-date technologies and practices, and thereby help MOR develop a&#13;
comprehensive environmental action strategy for the railways (Annex8).&#13;
3.53      Resettlement. Under the proposed electrification, resettlement would result&#13;
from land acquisition along the Wuhan-Guangzhou line, to make land available for the&#13;
extension of stations, and the construction of substations and power supply depots. It&#13;
would affect about 13,200 individuals (4,300 due to housing demolition). No sites of&#13;
notable historical or cultural value are in or near the land to be acquired, nor are they&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
known to contain habitats of endangered species. MOR has submitted a resettlement plan&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank (Annex 9!.&#13;
3.54      While resettlement activities would be funded by MOR, the villages and&#13;
townships in rural areas and the city district government in urban areas would be&#13;
responsible for planning and implementing them. The local branches of the land&#13;
administration offices at the county level are charged with monitoring resettlement&#13;
activities to ensure they comply with the Land Management Law, and the State Audit&#13;
Agency is charged with auditing the use of resettlement funds. Experience under previous&#13;
railway projects has shown this arrangement to be satisfactory. To ensure a continuous&#13;
satisfactory resettlement process, MOR has contracted with the Social Sciences Research&#13;
Institute (SSRI) of Southwest Jiaotong University to monitor resettlement activities and&#13;
alert MOR to problems. MOR would make available to the Bank annual monitoring and&#13;
evaluation reports prepared by the university. Agreement was reached at negotiations that&#13;
the Borrower, through MOR, will ensure that land acquisition and resettlement will be&#13;
done according to a plan acceptable to the Bank (para. 6. le).&#13;

4. ECONOMIC EVALUATION AND RISK ANALYSIS&#13;
OF PROJECT-FINANCED INVESTMENTS&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
4.1       The following five investment components have undergone economic&#13;
evaluation:   expanding corridor capacity, upgrading telecommunications systems,&#13;
modernizing information systems, commercializing container transport, and expanding&#13;
system capacity. Monetary inputs and outputs used in the evaluations were obtained by&#13;
converting financial costs to economic costs using economic shadow prices and their&#13;
related conversion factors in two key areas. For local labor costs, a conversion factor to&#13;
account for the value of fringe benefits was applied to the amount associated with basic&#13;
wages. For locomotives and rolling stock, the analysis used a conversion factor based on&#13;
the nonsubsidized prices charged by MOR to third-party buyers.  Details on the&#13;
assumptions are in the Project File.&#13;
B. MAiN BENEFTs&#13;
4.2       The estimated net present values (NPV) and economic internal rates of return&#13;
(ERR) for each investment component are summarized in the table below (special attention&#13;
was devoted to avoiding double accounting both between and within component&#13;
categories). The table also indicates the NPVs for the five components in terms of three&#13;
major benefit categories:&#13;
(a)  By increasing throughput capacity, both the system  capacity expansion&#13;
component and the telecommunications component would facilitate the&#13;
production and distribution of new bulk and manufactured goods. As a&#13;
consequence, these components would produce value added to the economy.&#13;
(b)  Upgrading and electrifying the Wuhan-Guangzhou line (corridor capacity&#13;
expansion component) and handling more container traffic by rail rather than&#13;
road (container transport commercialization component) would reduce the cost&#13;
of transport services.&#13;
(c)  Improvements made possible by the telecommunications and information&#13;
systems components would enable MOR to make more efficient use of existing&#13;
rolling stock and fixed plant, thereby creating savings in capital investment&#13;
outlays.&#13;

4.3        Besides the benefits quantified above, several components-particularly the&#13;
expansion of system capacity and commercialization of container transport-would help&#13;
spur development of interior provinces by expanding transport services into these areas.&#13;
C. EXPANING CORRIDOR CAPACrrY&#13;
4.4         Over the next decade, rail freight demand on the Wuhan-Guangzhou corridor&#13;
is expected to grow substantially. By the year 2000, the line will be called upon to handle&#13;
more than 203 million tons-two thirds more than the 123 million tons transported in 1991.&#13;
In 2005, demand is anticipated to approach 245 million tons-a doubling of current levels.&#13;
Passenger traffic also is projected to expand rapidly: compared to the 29 billion pkm&#13;
handled by the line today, personal travel will increase 40 percent by the turn of the&#13;
century and 75 percent by 2005.&#13;
4.5        The Wuhan-Guangzhou line, as currently configured and operated, lacks the&#13;
capacity to handle all the contemplated growth in freight demand (as priority has been&#13;
given to passenger trains). Consequently, without the project, as least 15 percent of the&#13;
anticipated freight volume would need to be rerouted to the more circuitous and&#13;
nonelectrified Beijing-Jiulong rail line (for through traffic the Beijing-Jiulong route is&#13;
1,32'7 km compared to the 1,044 km of the Wuhan-Guangzhou line). In addition, without&#13;
this investment component, some of the projected Wuhan-Guangzhou freight traffic also&#13;
would be diverted to more costly road transport.&#13;
4.6        The benefits were estimated in terms of transport operating costs savings&#13;
attributable to the lower fuel and maintenance outlays made possible by shifting from diesel&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
to electric traction. These savings, in turn, relate to the passenger and freight traffic that,&#13;
without the project, would be moved over the Wuhan-Guangzhou line by diesel traction,&#13;
and to the freight traffic that would be redirected to the longer, diesel-operated Beijing-&#13;
Jiulong route. Because the unit costs of trucking in China are over 10 times higher than&#13;
comparable rail outlays, the diversion to trucks that would be avoided by this component&#13;
would produce further benefits. These savings are properly classified as reductions in&#13;
transport operating costs. Electricity was not shadow-priced to reflect shortages because&#13;
electricity for the line would not be taken from industry, but would be provided through&#13;
investment earmarked for expansion of power generation capacity.  Still, sensitivity&#13;
analysis showed that the project would still be economically justified even with the price&#13;
of electricity doubled.&#13;
4.7       Complementary investment costs are quantified as the difference between the&#13;
costs of the with- and without-project scenarios. The with-project scenario costs include&#13;
capital costs for a generating plant with the requisite capacity to supply the Wuhan-&#13;
Guangzhou line with electric power; the cost of maintaining the overhead catenary system;&#13;
the cost of new locomotives and rolling stock less the cost of comparable equipment that&#13;
would otherwise be required if diesel service continued; and the costs of population&#13;
resettlement. Under the without-project scenario, freight traffic would be diverted to the&#13;
Beijing-Jiulong route. To accommodate this traffic, certain fixed plant capital costs would&#13;
be incurred (e.g., the double tracking of the Xiangtang-Longchuan section at an earlier&#13;
date than now planned, and double tracking lines connecting the alternative route to both&#13;
Wuhan and Guangzhou). The resulting NPV discounted at 12 percent is Y 4.1 billion and&#13;
the ERR is 26.1 (Table 4.1).&#13;
D. MODERNIZING INFORMATION SYSTEMS&#13;
4.8       From the experience of railways in other countries, modernized information&#13;
systems produce significant investment savings. The Canadian National, for example,&#13;
attributes freight car savings of 3.4 percent annually to the introduction of information&#13;
systems. The consequences for British Rail-large gains in the utilization of rolling stock&#13;
-are similar. Acknowledging the large capital outlay contemplated by MOR, even&#13;
conservative estimates of improvement in plant and equipment efficiency stemming from&#13;
a better information system would yield relatively large savings. (The savings in plant and&#13;
equipment tabulated for this component are separate from and in addition to the capital&#13;
investment savings quantified for the telecommunications component.) The information&#13;
systems component is anticipated to yield an NPV of Y 4.0 billion and an ERR of&#13;
42.2 percent (Table 4.2).&#13;
E. UPGRADING TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS&#13;
4.9       The expansion and modernization of MOR's telecommunications networks by&#13;
this component would make more productive use of existing capital assets. Thus, two&#13;
major types of benefits can be anticipated. First, better telecommunications would enable&#13;
MOR to improve car tumaround times and reduce the downtime for locomotive&#13;
maintenance. This, in turn, would raise the freight-hauling capacity of the system. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
is because an improved telecommunications system would allow freight wagons to be&#13;
dispatched more efficiently, and thereby enable the average wagon to make more trips.&#13;
When a wagon makes only one additional trip per year, its effective annual freight capacity&#13;
increases by 1.5 percent annually. Calculated on a systemwide basis, this amounts to&#13;
nearly 23 million tons in incremental freight capacity and associated benefits in the form&#13;
of value-added to the economy. At the same time, the more intensive use of existing plant&#13;
and equipment made possible by upgraded telecommunications also defers the need for new&#13;
capital expenditures, which MOR presently estimates at about Y 70 billion per year. Thus,&#13;
the gains in efficiency stemming from improved telecommunications would create&#13;
additional benefits by postponing the need for near-term capital investment outlays. The&#13;
NPV of this component is estimated at Y 5 billion and the ERR at 30.2 percent-a rate that&#13;
is well in line with other Bank-funded telecommunications projects. Not quantified here&#13;
are other benefits including higher worker productivity, greater service quality, and more&#13;
reliable communications (Table 4.3).&#13;
F. COMMRCIALIZING CONTAINER TRANSPORT&#13;
4.10      Following the pilot container transport project funded by the Bank under&#13;
Railways VI, this component would further enhance MOR's efforts at moving larger&#13;
quantities of higher-valued goods in containers. This merchandise is now handled either&#13;
by truck or rail in break-bulk form. For traffic diverted from trucks, economic benefits&#13;
stem from: (a) the much lower unit cost of container rail transport; and (b) the shorter trip&#13;
distances of rail compared with truck. Based on the lengths of haul for the five highest-&#13;
volume rail container routes in service today (Shanghai-Xian, Shanghai-Tianjin,&#13;
Guangzhou-Zhengzhou, Beijing-Guangzhou, and Guangzhou-Wuhan), the long-run variable&#13;
cost of transporting goods by rail is nearly Y 860 per ton less than the comparable cost via&#13;
truck. For traffic diverted from break-bulk rail service, savings in handling costs are&#13;
estimated by MOR at Y 106 per ton. The resulting NPV of this investment is Y 956&#13;
million and the ERR is 29.0 percent (Table 4.4).&#13;
G. EXPANDING SYSrEM CAPACrrY&#13;
4.11      While they would eventually be used systemwide, three-phase AC electric&#13;
locomotives would be deployed first on the mountainous Baoji-Chengdu route in western&#13;
China. At present, this line-utilizing standard SS4 electric locomotives-operates at&#13;
capacity and cannot sustain any growth in freight volume. By comparison, the AC units&#13;
can haul about 20 percent more than the SS4s. Further, due to their greater power, higher&#13;
speed and more effective braking systems, the AC units permit more trains to be run over&#13;
the line than do the SS4 units. Taken together, these capacity-enhancing features of the&#13;
AC locomotives would greatly increase the amount of traffic that can be carried over the&#13;
route, from 20.2 million tons today to 37 million tons-a gain of 78 percent.&#13;
4.12      Given this increase, the project would foster the production and consumption&#13;
of new products that would result in value-added benefits to the economy (especially in the&#13;
interior western region). These benefits have been calculated based on the anticipated&#13;
yearly growth in incremental traffic using a methodology for valuing induced traffic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
Further, compared to the SS4s, the AC units are expected to cost less to maintain and have&#13;
a much lower failure rate. Consequently, benefits in the form of annual operating savings&#13;
of about 16 percent per year also are anticipated.&#13;
4.13      MOR proposes to import 32 locomotives over the three-year period 1997-99.&#13;
In calculating the economic costs of this component, a unit price representing the average&#13;
of initial quotations already obtained by MOR has been employed. Since the locomotives&#13;
are to be manufactured and assembled abroad, there are no pertinent local costs. The&#13;
initial quotations also include a three-year spare parts guarantee; accordingly, it is not&#13;
necessary to specify this cost element separately until 1999. Finally, an allowance for&#13;
tools, instruments, and training is included as a part of the total project investment.&#13;
Because import duties and value added taxes are not regarded as economic costs, they have&#13;
been excluded from this analysis. Including the complementary costs for expanding mine&#13;
and factory capacity needed to produce the incremental traffic, the NPV of this component&#13;
is estimated at Y 3.7 billion and the ERR at 20.5 percent of the incremental investment of&#13;
replacing SS4s with new locomotives (Table 4.5).&#13;
H. OVERALL EVALUATION AND RISK ANALYSIS&#13;
4.14      As summarized in the table above, each of the components has an ERR of at&#13;
least 20 percent and taken together, all components as a group yield an overall ERR of&#13;
26.7 percent. The NPVs of most components exceed Y 3.7 billion (the NPV of the&#13;
comparatively lower-cost container transport component amounts to almost Y 1.0 billion).&#13;
The investments would expand rail capacity and thereby create more value added of goods&#13;
and services-particularly in the interior provinces. Moreover, the more efficient rail&#13;
service afforded by these investments would produce additional benefits in the form of&#13;
lower capital outlays and reduced transport operating expenses. Therefore, the proposed&#13;
investment is well justified.&#13;
4.15      Execution of the investment components would entail certain risks. Several&#13;
of the components-the AC locomotives, information systems and telecommunications-&#13;
involve newer technologies. As such, they are subject to delays in procurement and&#13;
implementation that could retard the flow of expected benefits. By contrast, with respect&#13;
to the Wuhan-Guangzhou corridor capacity expansion component, the technologies are well&#13;
known to MOR. One concern, though, pertains to the failure rate of electric catenary&#13;
systems and whether MOR's statement of electric locomotive operating expenses fully&#13;
reflects these outlays. To compensate for possible shortfalls, an additional complementary&#13;
cost for catenary maintenance is included in the economic analysis. The risks and potential&#13;
benefits of the container transport component largely depend on the pricing and logistics&#13;
policies adopted by CRC and SIT. Rates that adequately cover rail long-run variable costs&#13;
and properly take into account the pricing and service offerings of trucks should succeed&#13;
in diverting substantial volumes of higher-value traffic from trucks. At the same time,&#13;
however, unreliable and erratic rail delivery schedules would fail to attract the desired&#13;
business, while below-cost rail tariffs would yield unacceptable losses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
4.16        To assess the above-mentioned risks, two separate sensitivity analyses were&#13;
conducted on each of the investment components. First, the economic cost (including all&#13;
complementary costs) of each component was increased by 20 percent. Second, the total&#13;
value of all economic benefits associated with each component was reduced by 20 percent.&#13;
In no case did any of these tests reduce the ERR to less than 15 percent. The results of&#13;
both sensitivity tests, along with the base-case values, are presented in the table below.&#13;

5. FINANCIL VIBILITY OF&#13;
RAILWAY TRANSPORT OPERATION&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
5.1       Since entering into an economic contract with the Government in 1986, MOR&#13;
has been financing all of its operating and capital expenditures through internally generated&#13;
funds and borrowings. This chapter examines the past and present financial performance&#13;
(1988-94) of the railway's transport operation (comprising the 12 regional administrations&#13;
but not including the diversified economy companies) and forecasts its future financial&#13;
performance (1995-2000).&#13;
B. PAS  FINANCL PERFR NCE&#13;
5.2       By Government decree, gross revenue from the railway's transport operation&#13;
is divided into two parts: the first is from base tariffs, which covers operating expenses&#13;
and contributes to the net income of the railway's transport operation; the second comes&#13;
from a Railway Construction Fund freight surcharge earmarked for capital investments and&#13;
cannot be used to meet operating expenses. This separation has served the Government's&#13;
effort to control operating costs. Adjustments of the base tariffs and freight surcharge&#13;
require SPC/State Council approval, which limits MOR's flexibility in setting tariffs.&#13;
5.3       During 1988-92, the railway was profitable, although an increasing operating&#13;
ratio since 1990 indicates that base tariffs did not keep pace with inflation and the complete&#13;
phasing out of input subsidies. Since 1988, operating costs per ctkm escalated 99 percent,&#13;
while revenues grew only 70 percent (the latter exclude freight surcharge revenues&#13;
earmarked for capital investments). From 1992-93, the cost of previously subsidized&#13;
inputs such as electricity, energy and materials increased 77, 58 and 41 percent,&#13;
respectively. Nonoperating expenses (i.e., interest) also grew 75 percent during this time&#13;
due to more borrowing for capital investment and to the phasing out of interest subsidies&#13;
by the Government. At the same time, the freight surcharge increased from 0.2 fen/tkm&#13;
in 1991 to 2.7 fen/tkm in 1993.&#13;
5.4       When it was introduced in 1991, the Railway Construction Fund was not&#13;
leveraged, i.e., funds had to be used 'yuan for yuan' for capital investments. However,&#13;
starting in 1993, the fund could be used to pay the interest on debt incurred for these&#13;
investments, and the railway showed a net loss of Y 0.7 billion in 1993 (after paying Y 3.2&#13;
billion interest from surcharge revenues). Had the surcharge revenues been included with&#13;
base tariff revenues, the railways would have shown a profit of Y 20.4 billion in 1993 (see&#13;
the table below).&#13;

C. PRESENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE&#13;
5.5             MOR projects (based on unaudited figures) an operating ratio approaching&#13;
100 percent and a loss of Y 2.9 billion (based on base tariffs and after paying Y 6.5 billion&#13;
interest from surcharge revenues) in 1994. If freight surcharge revenues were treated as&#13;
fungible with base tariff revenues, MOR would project a profit of about Y 26.0 billion.&#13;
MOR is now in a situation that it has funds to build new railway lines, but is having&#13;
trouble maintaining the railway's physical assets and replenishing pension and welfare&#13;
funds because of the segregation of base tariff and freight surcharge revenues. Protracted&#13;
deferment of maintenance could impair the safety of railway operations, especially by&#13;
heightening the risk of derailments.&#13;
5.6             As to  financial self-sufficiency  (see definition  in  table in para. 5.14), MOR&#13;
projects that the railway will internally generate 67 percent (compared to 75 percent in&#13;
1993) of average capital investments including equipment replacements, other than normal&#13;
repairs and maintenance. The decline is due to higher capital investments (Y 45.0 billion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
in 1994 compared to Y 40.0 billion in 1993) and to the absence of across-the-board tariff&#13;
increases in 1994 [i.e., in 1994, only selective tariff increases (see para. 5.8) compared&#13;
to an across-the-board freight surcharge increase in 1993 took place].&#13;
5.7       The self-financing ratio in the railways is relatively high because 80 to close&#13;
to 100 percent of internally generated funds is from freight surcharge revenues that are&#13;
earmarked for capital investments. The remainder of the internally generated funds are&#13;
noncash expenses (i.e., depreciation) and the difference between base tariff and operating&#13;
(excluding depreciation) and nonoperating expenses.&#13;
5.8       MOR is trying to sustain the railway's profitability (i.e., the excess of book&#13;
tariff revenues over expenses) by containing costs, raising productivity, and proposing&#13;
tariff hikes. With regard to freight, MOR initiated in 1993 a "new line, new tariff" policy&#13;
to achieve full cost recovery for newly built lines. Applying the policy to the new Daqin,&#13;
Lanwu and Zhenwu lines raised the average base freight tariff from 2.7 fen/tkm in 1992&#13;
to 2.9 fen/tkm in 1993 (a 6.7 percent increase). With regard to passenger traffic, two new&#13;
policies were introduced. First, a "higher price for higher-quality service" policy was&#13;
applied to 12 pairs of passenger trains in 1993 and to 26 train pairs in 1994. Second,&#13;
passenger tariffs were raised in Guangdong province during peak demand periods. These&#13;
measures increased the average passenger fare from 4.4 fen/pkm in 1992 to 4.6 fen/pkm&#13;
in 1993 (a 3.4 percent increase). Still, these initiatives were insufficient to keep the&#13;
railway profitable (excluding freight surcharge revenues) in 1994.&#13;
5.9       To restore profitability, MOR has proposed to SPC a cost-index methodology&#13;
for justifying future tariff adjustments. In addition, MOR has developed a costing model.&#13;
Once data are available, the costing model will have the capability to track specific point-&#13;
to-point costs that, combined with a centralized waybill file (to be developed along with&#13;
management information systems), can calculate revenues and costs for the origin-&#13;
destination movements of major commodities, and thus, determine profitable and loss-&#13;
making lines and traffic categories. MOR is also preparing a plan in which concrete&#13;
measures for reductions of operating costs over the next two to three years would be set&#13;
forth.&#13;
D. FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE: BASE CASE&#13;
5.10      The base case reflects the most likely increases in base tariffs and freight&#13;
surcharge from 1995 to 1997 and MOR's proposed capital investments from 1995 to 2000.&#13;
In the base case and all scenarios (except the medium scenario, which assumes a surcharge&#13;
increase in 1998), under the sensitivity analysis, it was assumed that no tariff increases&#13;
would take place from 1998 to 2000. This approach was taken because discussions with&#13;
the client on tariff increases beyond 1997 were inconclusive. Key assumptions for the base&#13;
case financial projections for 1995-2000 are given below. Detailed financial assumptions&#13;
are in the Project File.&#13;
(a)  A capital investment program of Y 61 billion in 1995 and Y 418 billion from&#13;
1996 to 2000 (including Y 350 billion of new investments and Y 68 billion of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
equipment replacement) based on a real GNP growth rate of 8 to 9 percent,&#13;
which corresponds to a combined freight and passenger traffic (ctkm) growth&#13;
rate of 6.6 percent per year;&#13;
(b)  About 50 percent of the capital investment plan to be implemented in 1995-97&#13;
and the remaining 50 percent in 1998-2000;&#13;
(c)  An increase in average passenger fares from 4.77 fen/pkm to 6.77 fen/pkm&#13;
in 1995 (about 42 percent increase);&#13;
(d)  An increase in average base freight tariffs from 2.85 to 4.35 fen/tkm in 1996&#13;
(about 53 percent increase);&#13;
(e)  An increase in the freight surcharge from 2.7 to 4.2 fen/tkm in 1997 (about&#13;
57 percent increase).&#13;
5.11      For 1995, MOR estimates a loss of Y 4.4 million; after a brief recovery in&#13;
1996 to 1998 (due to projected tariff increases in 1995, 1996 and 1997), it projects losses&#13;
in 1999 and 2000 because no tariff increases were assumed beyond 1997 (see para. 5.10)&#13;
(see table below). The operating ratio (net of freight surcharge revenue) approaches&#13;
100 percent in 1995, recovers to 82 percent in 1996, but deteriorates to 98 percent by&#13;
2000. Aside from the projected loss/profit, MOR would have net surcharge revenues&#13;
ranging from a low of about Y 29 billion in 1995 to a high of about Y 62 billion in 2000.&#13;
The surcharge revenues are net of interest; since 1993 SPC and MOF have allowed MOR,&#13;
on a year-to-year basis, to use surcharge revenues to cover some nonoperational expenses.&#13;
Thus, a first step has been set in the direction of fungibility of revenue sources. If&#13;
surcharge revenues were fungible in their entirety, the net result would be a profitable&#13;
MOR (see table below). The self-financing ratio is projected at 67 percent in 1994 (based&#13;
on unaudited figures), 52 percent in 1995, 63 percent in 1996 and over 80 percent from&#13;
1997 to 1999.&#13;
E. SENsrnwvr ANALYSIS&#13;
5.12      The ability of the railway to increase the base tariffs and freight surcharge is&#13;
crucial to the upkeep of its infrastructure, the welfare of its workforce, and the realization&#13;
of its capital investment program. Two scenarios, a low and high case, are examined in&#13;
comparison with the base case, where the low case implies no tariff increases for the&#13;
period forecast and the high case implies the full tariff increases as proposed to the State&#13;
Council in June 1994. In addition, a medium case is tested to determine the implications&#13;
of delaying all tariff increases, assumed in the base case, by one year. The purpose is to&#13;
evaluate the implications for: (a) the level of the self-financing ratio, (b) the amount to&#13;
be borrowed, and (c) coverage of debt service. The detailed financial results under each&#13;
of the scenarios are in the Project File.&#13;
5.13      The results are given in the table below. The low-case scenarios assume no&#13;
tariff increases from 1995 to 2000 and can be rejected because it implies that MOR either&#13;

has to: (a) reduce its capital investments by almost 15 percent in 1995 and by over&#13;
70 percent during the 1996 to 2000 period; or (b) borrow substantial amounts to implement&#13;
its investment plan in 1995 to 2000, and run its operations from 1995 onward. Option (a)&#13;
is contradictory to a national investment policy to increase investments in transport; option&#13;
(b) is infeasible because MOR could not service its debt from 1997 onward. Both low-case&#13;
scenarios result in increasing operating losses (due to base tariffs and freight revenues not&#13;
being  fungible), evidenced  by an operating ratio of 111 percent in  1995, deteriorating to&#13;
141 percent by 2000.&#13;
5.14            The high-case scenario assumes that the railway receives approval for the full&#13;
tariff increase as submitted to the State Council in June 1994: average base freight tariffs&#13;
increase in 1996 from 2.85 fen to 5.55 fen per tkm, while increases in passenger tariffs&#13;
and surcharges remain the same as under the base case. In addition, the 1996 to 2000&#13;
capital investment program is assumed to increase by Y 50 billion to reflect the high end&#13;
of the Y 350-400 planning range. The high case should also be rejected because it&#13;
assumes that the proposals MOR submitted to SPC in June 1994 for increases in freight&#13;
tariffs, freight surcharge and passenger rates would be approved in their entirety with&#13;

regard to timing and level of increase. Based on experience since 1990, this is unlikely&#13;
to happen.&#13;
5.15             The medium-case scenario assumes a one-year delay in tariff increases, i.e.,&#13;
average passenger tariffs increase by 2 fen/pkm in 1996, average base freight tariffs&#13;
increase by 2.7 fen/tkm in 1997, and the freight surcharge increases by 1.5 fen/tkm in&#13;
1998. As a result of decreased revenues, MOR would need to mobilize Y 97 billion in&#13;
additional borrowings during 1995 to 2000 to maintain positive cash flow. The loss in&#13;
1995 would increase from Y 4 to Y 12 billion and a loss of Y 9 billion would be incurred&#13;
in 1996. MOR would become profitable in 1997. Including surcharge revenues, MOR&#13;
would be profitable in each year from 1995 to 2000.&#13;
F. CONCLUSIONS&#13;
5.16            The base case is the most desirable scenario because it limits the period of&#13;
transitional losses (the latter not including surcharge revenues). The low case is a worst-&#13;
case scenario because it would either not enable the railways to carry out the much-needed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
capital investments, or it would result in a nonviable railways from 1999 if it borrows the&#13;
funds needed to implement the capital investments program. The medium case represents&#13;
a possible altemative to the base case. It is less desirable because it lengthens the period&#13;
of transitional losses by one year.&#13;
5.17      To effectively serve an increasingly market-driven economy, the railway&#13;
requires, among other things, to increase its base tariffs by at least an amount that would&#13;
allow it to phase out its transitional losses. Agreement was reached at negotiations that&#13;
the Borrower, through MOR, will produce or cause to be produced in respect of MOR's&#13;
railway transport operations, for each of its fiscal years, finds from internal sources&#13;
equivalent to not less than the following percentage of the annual average of the capital&#13;
expenditures incurred, or expected to be incurred, for that year, the previous fiscal year&#13;
and the next followingfiscal year: (a) for itsfiscal year ending on December 31, 1995 and&#13;
its fiscal year ending on December 31, 1996: 50 percent; and (b) for each of its fiscal&#13;
years thereafter: 55 percent (para. 6. 1f).&#13;

6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
6.1       During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Borrower that it, through&#13;
MOR, will:&#13;
(a)  Implement the PID components of railway enterprise reform, railway tariff&#13;
reform, and labor productivity according to action plans acceptable to the&#13;
Bank (para. 3.9);&#13;
(b)  (i) select at least two container transport companies acceptable to the Bank to&#13;
which the container transport and handling equipment to be procured under the&#13;
project shall be leased; (ii) employ consultants with terms of reference,&#13;
qualifications and experience acceptable to the Bank to assist it in the&#13;
preparation of contractual agreements between the Borrower and said container&#13;
transport companies required for the leasing and operation of said equipment&#13;
on a commercial basis; (iii) furnish said agreements to the Bank promptly&#13;
upon their preparation and afford the Bank a reasonable opportunity to&#13;
exchange views with the Borrower thereon; (iv) thereafter, take all measures&#13;
required on its part to conclude said agreements with said container transport&#13;
companies, taking into account the views of the Bank on the matter; and&#13;
(v) ensure that no invitations to bid for contracts for container transport and&#13;
handling equipment included in the project shall be issued unless and until the&#13;
Borrower shall have concluded the agreements referred to in item (iv) above&#13;
(para. 3.19);&#13;
(c)  Carry out the study components of (i) dedicated passenger rail feasibility,&#13;
(ii) application of the RIS decision-support system, (iii) railway information&#13;
systems development, (iv) railway telecommunications systems management,&#13;
(v) diesel engine design, (vi) strengthening of MOR's treasury functions, and&#13;
(vii) restructuring the railway's manufacturing sector, according to action&#13;
plans acceptable to the Bank; then, exchange views with the Bank on the&#13;
studies' recommendations; and, finally, implement the recommendations,&#13;
taking into account the Bank's comments (para. 3.34);&#13;
(d)  Undertake, jointly with the Bank, a mid-term review of project implementation&#13;
no later than November 30, 1998 (para. 3.50);&#13;
(e)  Ensure that (i) the project will be implemented according to health, safety, and&#13;
environmental standards acceptable to the Bank and (ii) the resettlement of&#13;
people affected by the corridor expansion component will be carried out&#13;
according to the plans acceptable to the Bank (paras. 3.52, 3.54); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
(f)  Produce or cause to be produced in respect of MOR's railway transport&#13;
operations, for each of its fiscal years, funds from internal sources equivalent&#13;
to not less than the following percentage of the annual average of the capital&#13;
expenditures incurred, or expected to be incurred, for that year, the previous&#13;
fiscal year and the next following fiscal year: (i) for its fiscal year ending on&#13;
December 31, 1995 and its fiscal year ending on December 31, 1996:&#13;
50 percent; and (ii) for each of its fiscal years thereafter: 55 percent (para.&#13;
5.17).&#13;
6.2        Subject to the above, the proposed project would be suitable for a loan of $400&#13;
million to the People's Republic of China. The loan would be for a term of 20 years,&#13;
including a grace period of 5 years, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.&#13;

BANK GROUP PARTICIPATION IN TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
1.        Through June 1994, the Bank Group had loaned about $4.53 billion to China&#13;
under 29 projects for the transport sector (see Table 1.6 for Summary Statistics) and is&#13;
now preparing several new transport sector projects.&#13;
2.        The railway subsector has received $1,785 million in Bank Group funding:&#13;
six loans to the national railway system (Loans 2394-CHA; 2540-CHA; 2678-CHA/Credit&#13;
1680-CHA; Loans 2968-CHA; 3406-CHA; and 3581-CHA) and one loan to the local&#13;
railway system (Loan 3060-CHA/Credit 2014-CHA). These projects have helped the&#13;
government expand capacity on key routes and modernize the technology for manufacturing&#13;
electric locomotives, passenger coaches, and signaling equipment. The local railway&#13;
project is financing the construction of a line in Inner Mongolia. The most recently&#13;
approved project is assisting MOR with railway policy and management initiatives;&#13;
institutional development of the railway system; expansion of railway capacity; and&#13;
modernization of railway technology on a systemwide basis. The audit of the First&#13;
Railway Project noted that physical components were well executed and that macropolicy&#13;
adjustments, especially in the area of tariff reforms, and investment prioritization were&#13;
likely to have the highest impact; these conclusions are being considered in the currently&#13;
proposed railway project. The project completion report for the Second Railway Project&#13;
is currently under way.&#13;
3.        The highway subsector has received $1,669 million in Bank Group financing&#13;
under 11 projects (Loans 2539-CHA/Credit 1594-CHA; Loan 2811-CHA/ Credit 1792-&#13;
CHA; Loan 2951-CHA/Credit 1917-CHA; Loan 2952-CHA; Credit 1984-CHA; Loan&#13;
3073-CHA/Credit2O25-CHA; Loans 3471-CHA; 3530-CHA; 3681-CHA; and 3748-CHA).&#13;
These projects provide for the construction of high-quality national and provincial roads&#13;
totaling about 2,180 km, and the expansion and improvement of some 6,851 km of rural&#13;
(lower class provincial, county, village) roads and major bridges. When completed, some&#13;
of these roads will help to provide vital missing links in the national highway network;&#13;
others will help to ease severe congestion in parts of the network or provide access to&#13;
remote areas. The projects are also designed to provide foreign technical assistance and&#13;
training of Chinese personnel in areas such as supervision and quality control of road&#13;
construction, design, and planning. Finally, the projects support studies on key issues of&#13;
highway development such as road safety, pavement management, user charges, and&#13;
methods of financing the expansion, improvement, and rehabilitation of the road network.&#13;
The First Highway Project (Loan 2539-CHA/Credit 1594-CHA) is completed; a Project&#13;
Completion Report was issued in May 1992.&#13;
4.        The ports subsector has received $715 million of Bank Group financing under&#13;
eight projects (Loans 2207-CHA, 2689-CHA, 2877-CHA/Credit 1845-CHA, Loan 2907-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90-                          ANNEX 1&#13;
CHA/Credit 1875-CHA, Loans 3006-CHA, 3007-CHA; Credit 5623-CHA; and Loan&#13;
3552-CHA). Most of the loan funds are being used in Shanghai, Tianjin, Dalian,&#13;
Huangpu, Ningbo, and Xiamen for construction of terminals, jetties, and berths for&#13;
handling bulk commodities, general cargo, and containers, as well as the dredging of&#13;
navigation channels. Funds also have been used for training, technical assistance, and&#13;
various studies such as port planning, operations management, and containerization. The&#13;
audit report of the first port project, found the project successfully completed, on time and&#13;
below cost, but recommended developing long-term strategic port investment, planning&#13;
ports and improving prequalification procedures; recommendations on the former point&#13;
have been incorporated in the preparation of the recent Shanghai Port Restoration and&#13;
Development project, and recommendations on the latter have been taken into account in&#13;
the discussion of procurement procedures in transport projects under preparation. The&#13;
Ship Waste Disposal Project (FY92) involves cofinancing between the International&#13;
Development Association (IDA) and the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) to improve&#13;
ways for disposal of ship effluents and thus reduce pollution of international and territorial&#13;
waters caused by ships' waste. The recent Shanghai Port Project (FY93) focuses on&#13;
restructuring and long-term port development with a complementary technical assistance&#13;
and training component targeting institutional and financial reforms.&#13;
5.        The urban transport subsector has received $210 million of Bank Group&#13;
financing under two projects (Credit 2296-CHA and Loan 3652-CHA). These two urban&#13;
transport projects are intended as a first stage of a long-term program to upgrade and&#13;
develop urban infrastructure in Shanghai. They finance capacity increases of key urban&#13;
links as well as traffic management and safety upgrades and assist the Shanghai&#13;
Metropolitan Govemment to strengthen public sector management capacity by improving&#13;
the planning and management of the urban transport system.&#13;
6.        One multimodal project was approved in 1991 (Loan 3316-CHA/Credit 2226-&#13;
CHA, $154 million) to improve provincial transport in Jiangsu. While the main focus of&#13;
this project is on rehabilitating the provincial road network, the project includes the first&#13;
loan to the inland waterway subsector to rehabilitate a section of the Grand Canal and&#13;
expand an important shiplock.&#13;

sures.&#13;
O Total compensation for the railway was based on a ratio of yuan per net tkm han-&#13;
dled, which has been negotiated an-nlly between MOR and the Ministry of Lsbor.&#13;
o Total compensation of individual entities within the railway was based on a series of&#13;
more explicit productivity rtios such as the amounts of freight and pauenger traffic&#13;
originated or carried per employee, the numbers of locomotives and rolling tock&#13;
produced or maintained per employee, etc.&#13;
In order to focus the attention of the railway on revenae and profit, the GOC has abolished&#13;
the economic contract tarting in 1995.&#13;
B. To separate regultion and mangement.        Based on MOR's recently adopted 30 Point Railway Reform document and MOR and SPC    There are ongoing discussion within&#13;

C. To remove DprCC and credit subsidies for MOR.   Since 1990, the governmeat hs been slowly phasing out various subsidies.&#13;
o  Prices for mnterials, including fuel and electricity, have been permitted to rise rdually&#13;
to international market levels. More specifically, price subsidies have bee_ reduced&#13;
froin 20-25 % in 1990 to zero by the end of 1993.&#13;
o Also, onlending interemt rates on loans to MOR have increased, e.g., to 5 % for Rail-&#13;

ZATION A STRENGTHENING ITS INTER-&#13;
NAL MANAGEMENT:&#13;
A. To improve the responsiveness of the railway  Staning in early 1994 MOR initiated a series of seven geographicly-based pilot programs    The State Council has now given approv-&#13;
to its customer needs                       aimed at introducing line-of-business type organizations so as to focus on the specific  al for threc entities to becomc separte&#13;

sion making.                               companies. Now these administrations and companies manage smil-cak investment pro-&#13;
jecta; retain profits on the basis of their performnance; and make stffing decision such as&#13;
the internal organizational structure, saff size and composition, and distribution of pay&#13;
incentives.&#13;
C. To control the size of the railway work force.    The RME Labor Productivity Study Team, in conjunction with MOR's Labor and Payrol                                     o&#13;
Departnment, has recommended and received approval from MOR to institute a number of&#13;
measures to control the size of the work force, as follows:&#13;

staffing levels of 12 employees per kilo-&#13;
meter of new line. This ratio compares&#13;
favorbly with the present railway aver-&#13;
age of 32 employces per kilometer of&#13;
line.&#13;
o  lntrduce local mumcnt penalties aimed at corstminiug overall taffig levels.  MOR has developed a manager fining&#13;
system which penalizes m gers from&#13;

D.  To strengthen internal management through    MOR has recently completed the implementation of a pilot management information system    This pilot installation demonstrated the&#13;

o In the Fourth Quarter of 1993 MOR agreed to implement the following Cost Effective&#13;

A. (continued)                                  o  Under the Bank-supported Railway Investment Study (RIS), MOR has developed a&#13;
decision-support system to improve the election of capacity expansion projects. The&#13;
RIS system has been ued in following three ways:&#13;
- to prioritize railway investment projects;&#13;
- to increase total traffic throughput by (a) using an optimal combination of improve-&#13;
ments, and (b) improving the freight routing procedures. One RIS scenario sug-&#13;
gested nearly 10% increase in traffic throughput, equivalent to S4-5 billion ovings in&#13;
railway construction cogs through the year 2000 for each measure); and&#13;
- to determine the size and composition of railway investment through the year 2000&#13;
under different economic growth scenarios.&#13;
B To develop costing systems and revise tariff  In March 1992, MOR and GOC formally launched a railway tariff study to addres the&#13;

INDICATORS AND TARGETS FOR MONITORING&#13;
THE PROGRESS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION OF INVESTMENT COMPONENTS&#13;
1.         MOR has agreed that during the period of operation of each component,&#13;
MOR would gather the following monitoring data on a regular basis for measuring the&#13;
achievement of project objectives. The data would serve Bank project supervision and&#13;
auditing, and provide MOR senior management with additional information on project&#13;
performance.&#13;
A. GENERAL&#13;
2.         The systemwide monitoring targets for each year through the year 2000 are&#13;
recorded in Table A at the end of annex. While there will be many factors in addition to&#13;
the Bank-financed investment components that will influence these targets, they provide&#13;
a framework to judge the overall impact of the Seventh Railway Project.&#13;

C. INFORMATION SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION&#13;
4.         The primary benefit of the TMIS and MIS systems will be the improvement&#13;
in the railway's overall operating performance.  These improvements can best be&#13;
measured by systemwide monitoring indicators contained in Table A. In addition, this&#13;
investment component is projected to produce the following two direct benefits that&#13;
would be monitored:&#13;
(a)   Approximately  4,000  clerical  positions  are  required   at  the  57&#13;
subadministrations and 12 statistical factories to process 4.8 million waybills&#13;
per month. Following the implementation of the TMIS and the first phase of&#13;
the integrated MIS under Railway VII, MOR projects that the remaining&#13;
clerical work at these locations clerical positions can be handled by 1,000&#13;
clerical positions, a reduction of 3,000 positions.&#13;
(b)   At present, it takes between 12 and 18 days to process these waybills and&#13;
produce the various waybill-based statistics and management reports.&#13;
Following implementation of the first phase of the MIS, this process should&#13;
be accomplished within 2 to 3 days.&#13;

6.         The container transport component is limited to providing financing for&#13;
12,000 twenty- and forty-foot containers, selected container-handling equipment and&#13;
container information systems. Nevertheless, the primary thrust of this component is to&#13;
increase the railway's focus on intermodal container operations.   This is being&#13;
accomplished through the establishment of two new container companies. Thus, the&#13;
success of this program can best be monitored by selected systemwide monitoring targets&#13;
such as increased market share. These targets are included as part of Table A.&#13;
F. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION&#13;
7.        The environmental protection component comprises a variety of small pilot&#13;
projects and studies. Each of these pilot projects and studies will produce measurable&#13;
environmental benefits on a localized basis. Monitoring indicators for each of these&#13;
projects will be specified in the individual work plans. Measurable impacts on the&#13;
railway's environment on a national or regional basis will occur when results of the pilot&#13;
projects are implemented systemwide.&#13;

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT: WUHAN-&#13;
GUANGZHOU ELECTRIEICATION AND UPGRADING&#13;
1.        Introduction.  The proposed project is classified as Category B for&#13;
environmental assessment purposes. The Wuhan-Guangzhou corridor expansion and&#13;
upgrading component, and other investment components 1/ are not expected to harm&#13;
the environment. A draft environmental assessment report prepared by MOR was&#13;
received by the Bank in May 1994. The report addressed the impacts of the Wuhan-&#13;
Guangzhou corridor expansion component. During the June/July preappraisal mission,&#13;
the draft environmental assessment was discussed with MOR officials in Beijing and the&#13;
Fourth Survey and Design Institute officials in Wuhan (who prepared the Environmental&#13;
Assessment report).  Taking into consideration the comments by the Bank, MOR&#13;
prepared a revised draft and submitted it to the Bank on October 12, 1994, before the&#13;
departure of the appraisal mission.&#13;
2.        The corridor expansion component involves the following construction:&#13;
(a) electrification of the 1,044 km Guangzhou to Wuhan line; (b) 24 substations (21 new,&#13;
3 reconstruction); (c) 26 sectioning stations (23 new, 3 reconstruction); (d) 7 switching&#13;
stations (5 new, 2 reconstruction); and (e) switchover to electric locomotives.&#13;
3.        Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures. Environmental impact&#13;
associated with the corridor expansion is expected to result mainly from construction and&#13;
operation of the corridor. Since the tracks and corridor right-of-way already exist, the&#13;
incremental impact is expected to be minor. During electrification of the line and&#13;
construction of associated facilities, which is expected to stretch over three and a half&#13;
years, major impacts will be from construction noise, fugitive dust, site wastewater,&#13;
garbage, disturbance of land used for temporary staging areas during construction, and&#13;
borrow pits. Noise impact will be minimized by avoiding night construction and by&#13;
keeping high noise-generating equipment away from noise-sensitive places. Dust will be&#13;
controlled by water sprinklers, by minimizing land disturbance and by reclaiming&#13;
disturbed land promptly. Use of land as staging areas will be kept to a minimum; topsoil&#13;
will be stockpiled and used to reclaim the disturbed area as soon as the construction is&#13;
completed. Where possible, the borrow pits will be used for aquaculture. Construction&#13;
workers will be educated in proper sanitation and wastewater will be handled as per&#13;
specified regulations. Garbage will be collected and disposed of at local landfill disposal&#13;
sites.&#13;
1/  The other investment components involve mainly the purchase of equipment and materials and minor&#13;
civil works, if any, such as the installation of fiber-optic cables.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 122 -                         ANNEX 8&#13;
4.        During operation, anticipated impacts include noise and vibration from trains,&#13;
electromagnetic fields from power lines and substations, oily wastewater disposal, solid&#13;
wastes, etc. Noise impact will be minimized by: locating new noise-sensitive buildings&#13;
(such as schools, residences, etc.) at least 100 meters from the railway tracks;&#13;
minimizing the indiscriminate use of whistles and by use of low-noise, highly directional&#13;
whistles; installing continuous-welded heavy metal tracks 60 km up and down track of&#13;
noise-sensitive locations such as Hengyang, Chengzhou, Yingde and Tangxi; planting&#13;
suitable plants and shrubs to form noise barriers near locomotive depots and other&#13;
sensitive locations; relocating certain facilities, such as Yeuyang Railway Kindergarten,&#13;
to less noisy sites; and retrofitting affected schools with sealed aluminum alloy windows&#13;
and air exchangers for fresh air.  Tracks traversing through cities will use shock&#13;
absorbing pads and heavy continuous-welded tracks to minimize vibrations. Impact from&#13;
electromagnetic fields will be minimized by locating substations, sectioning stations and&#13;
locomotive depots away from residences. Existing residences, cable TV networks and&#13;
other facilities affected by the electromagnetic field will be relocated gradually.&#13;
5.        Rolling stock, electric locomotives and the depots will generate oily&#13;
wastewater that will be disposed of using the existing, expanded or refurbished facilities&#13;
utilizing  sedimentation, oil separation and/or air flotation treatment.   A  pilot&#13;
oil/wastewater treatment project will be initiated at a selected facility to identify and&#13;
demonstrate an oil/water separation technology best suited to Chinese conditions.&#13;
Sewage from the facilities will be handled as per current requirements. Solid waste&#13;
(mainly lunch boxes) from passenger trains is expected to increase by about 12 percent.&#13;
Solid waste will be collected at major stations and vehicles will be provided at those&#13;
stations to collect, transport and dispose of the wastes to local landfills. The project&#13;
includes a technical assistance component to assist MOR to develop a lunch box&#13;
management strategy to identify and assess alternatives to continued lunch box use, and&#13;
an investment component to initiate a pilot program based on those findings.&#13;
6.        Environmental Benefits. Following completion of the Wuhan to Guangzhou&#13;
corridor expansion, coal and fuel consumption will be reduced by 39.5 percent and&#13;
93.6 percent, respectively. The report estimates that this will result in an improvement&#13;
in air quality along the corridor through reduction in dust, SO2, NO, and CO. These are&#13;
estimated to decrease by 94.6, 65.8, 86.2, and 56.7 percent, respectively. Measures to&#13;
strictly control garbage, and collect and recycle lunch boxes will minimize land pollution.&#13;
To ensure environmental mitigative measures are being undertaken, MOR has committed&#13;
personnel and resources to project monitoring. Progress reports will be provided to the&#13;
Bank on an annual basis.&#13;
7.        Railway VII also includes a number of environmental technical assistance and&#13;
pilot program investment components, whose findings and application will benefit not&#13;
only the Wuhan-Guangzhou line but also the rest of MOR. The proposed pilot programs&#13;
and technical assistance studies will acquaint MOR with up-to-date environmental&#13;
protection technologies and practices. When implemented, these programs will form a&#13;
firm foundation for development of a comprehensive environmental action strategy for&#13;
the Chinese railways.&#13;

RESETTLEMENT PLAN: WUHAN-GUANGZHOU&#13;
ELECTRIEFICATION AND UPGRADING&#13;
I.        The Project. The capacity expansion component of Railways VII consists of&#13;
the electrification and modernization of the Wuhan-Guangzhou railway line. The length&#13;
of the railway line is 1,044.262 km and if the Jingguang line in the railway hub of&#13;
Wuhan is included, the entire railway length is 1,081.172 km. The line moves through&#13;
the three provinces of Hubei, Hunan and Guangdong. Ten regional-level cities and more&#13;
than 20 towns (county-level) will be affected by land acquisition and resettlement. The&#13;
major purpose of land acquisition in this project is to meet the needs of station and&#13;
substation expansion and construction of electricity supply depots. The project does not&#13;
involve construction of new railway tracks and only the existing tracks are proposed to be&#13;
electrified. The land that will be affected as a result of land acquisition can be classified&#13;
into (a) regional-level cities, medium and small towns and counties, and (b) rural areas.&#13;
The former involves production units, commercial structures and residential buildings.&#13;
The latter includes agricultural land, residential structures, wooded areas and wasteland.&#13;
2.        According to the feasibility study of the Wuchang Hengyang and Hengyang-&#13;
Guangzhou sections of the railway line, it is estimated that land acquisition of 6,582 mu,&#13;
building demolition of 279,467 m2 and resettlement of 865 households (about 4,300&#13;
persons) will be required.  A total of 13,168 people will be affected.  A detailed&#13;
socioeconomic survey of the affected people will be conducted before displacement in&#13;
order to establish a baseline of income levels and standards of living. The area to be&#13;
acquired for the project is predominantly agricultural land. Only 5 percent of the land is&#13;
in urban areas. The railway line passes through some of the more developed agricultural&#13;
areas of the country. No areas of archeological importance will be affected for the&#13;
project. The land acquisition and resettlement activities will be initiated in 1994 and will&#13;
be completed in 1998.&#13;
3.        Policy Framework and Legal Provisions for Resettlement. Resettlement&#13;
caused by state projects such as railroads is guided by the Land Management Law of the&#13;
People's Republic of China and associated provincial implementing regulations ("the city&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 124 -                         ANNEX 9&#13;
acquisition and resettlement for this project.  The only variation is in the rates of&#13;
compensation permissible, which are a function of the local conditions and price&#13;
structure. The basic principle guiding land acquisition and resettlement is that the land-&#13;
using department must not only pay compensation for the properties affected but it must&#13;
also guarantee that those affected by land acquisition, after resettlement, must enjoy a&#13;
living standard not lower than their original standard of living. In other words, in order&#13;
to ensure that the standard of living of the affected people is maintained or improved, the&#13;
land-using unit must pay adequate compensation to and arrange employment for them.&#13;
4.        The national laws concerning land acquisition and resettlement compensation&#13;
stipulate that, according to the actual farm size acquired and the number of people&#13;
involved, each affected person should be compensated with an amount equal to 2-3 times&#13;
the average total annual output per mu in the last three years from the land being&#13;
acquired. Under normal circumstances, the resettlement compensation does not exceed&#13;
10 times the average annual output value per mu in the last three years before&#13;
acquisition. However, if the affected farmers are unable to restore their previous&#13;
standard of living when compensation is calculated according to the normal compensation&#13;
standards, the compensation may be increased under the approval of the concerned&#13;
department. However, the total land acquisition and resettlement compensation fees may&#13;
not exceed 20 times the average annual output of the acquired land in the previous three&#13;
years before acquisition.&#13;
5.        The following principles of compensation and resettlement would be&#13;
applicable:&#13;
(a)  Compensation for land acquisition used exclusively for vegetables, rice and&#13;
fisheries are based on the average annual value of output for three years&#13;
preceding acquisition. An amount equivalent to 5-6 times the annual output&#13;
will be paid as compensation. Similarly, compensation for orchards, tea&#13;
plantations, residential land and tree fields are calculated based on average&#13;
annual output multiplied by a factor that varies according to the type of land.&#13;
There is a difference in compensation procedures for collectively owned and&#13;
state-owned land. In the former case, which is more relevant here, the&#13;
national regulations clearly stipulate that those persons losing land will&#13;
receive compensation adequate to maintain their original standard of living&#13;
during and after resettlement. Compensation for restoring production goes to&#13;
the collective unit owning the lost land,. while individuals receive direct&#13;
payment for the value of standing crops lost and for trees, houses, and other&#13;
individually owned assets. The collective is responsible for planning and&#13;
implementing resettlement that maintains living standards and for negotiating&#13;
with MOR the exact compensation to be paid.&#13;
(b)  Housing compensation will vary depending on the type and location of&#13;
housing. The rates vary from Y 200-300/m2 for ordinary structures in the&#13;
rural areas to Y 300-500/m2 for houses in Guangdong. Compensation for&#13;
structures used for production facilities will be negotiated between the land-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 125 -                        ANNEX 9&#13;
acquiring unit, the local administrative office and the affected production&#13;
unit. Other buildings are valued on a replacement cost basis. A survey of&#13;
building type and quality is undertaken by MOR as part of resettlement&#13;
planning.  That initial evaluation becomes the basis for negotiating&#13;
compensation with the owner of the building.&#13;
(c)  When business structures are acquired, the principle of "first new&#13;
construction, then old demolition" should be followed. If urgent construction&#13;
requires that business or production be stopped right away, MOR will pay a&#13;
production stoppage fee to the affected unit according to the total salaries&#13;
paid to workers employed in the unit multiplied by 15 percent. For the&#13;
workers whose employment is affected by work stoppage, full payment of&#13;
salaries must be made by MOR. If some commercial structures need to be&#13;
removed urgently, temporary commercial structures will be built to prevent&#13;
loss of jobs.&#13;
(d)  If, after land acquisition, the per capita land area is less than 0.1 mu, the&#13;
land-using unit shall be responsible for arranging employment for them and&#13;
paying for such employment. If the concerned departments are unable to&#13;
adequately deal with the employment arrangement issue, the land-using unit&#13;
and other government or collectively owned enterprises may provide&#13;
assistance to the affected people to secure a job.   Unemployment&#13;
compensation is provided until the new job begins. Those who have the least&#13;
amount of residual land will be given priority in provision of jobs.&#13;
Compensation paid to a unit as a result of land acquisition may only be used&#13;
to expand business and production or to develop secondary agricultural&#13;
production. The compensation may also be used as a subsistence allowance&#13;
for those unable to find employment. No unit or individual may distribute&#13;
these designated compensation funds for other purposes. All cities, towns&#13;
and villages must submit a resettlement fund utilization report to the land-&#13;
using department concerned every year.&#13;
(e)  The local government and "negotiation and conflict resolution group" will be&#13;
responsible for arranging a new rental place, comparable in rent and standard&#13;
to the original rental residences, for the tenants and will also pay for the&#13;
transfer. If such arrangements cannot be made, a one-time compensation,&#13;
deducted from the affected house owner's compensation fees, may be paid&#13;
the affected tenants.&#13;
6.        Affected Population. About 13,00 persons will be affected by land and&#13;
house acquisition under the project, of whom about 4,300 will have to move because&#13;
their houses will be demolished. The project files contain a family-by-family census of&#13;
housing and land lost to the project. A detailed socioeconomic survey of the affected&#13;
people will be carried out before displacement, in order to document their present&#13;
standards of living. The success, or otherwise, of the resettlement program will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 126 -                         ANNEX 9&#13;
evaluated based on the extent to which the original standards of living of the affected&#13;
people can be improved, or at least restored.&#13;
7.        Resettlement Planning and Implementation. Responsibility for planning&#13;
and implementing resettlement rests with city, country, township and village&#13;
governments. The local Land Administration Offices monitor resettlement and ensure&#13;
compliance with the Land Management Law. MOR is responsible for planning physical&#13;
works in a manner that minimizes resettlement and for paying compensation as required&#13;
under the Land Management Law. MOR compensation payments are channeled through&#13;
the Land Administration Offices.  The State Audit Administration assumes audit&#13;
responsibility for disbursed funds.&#13;
8.        MOR negotiates compensation with the land management department of each&#13;
affected county, which negotiates on behalf of all affected villages. Although the Land&#13;
Management Law sets standard multiples of crop output value by which to determine&#13;
compensation, negotiation can occur over the measurement of crop output value and&#13;
whether the mandated goal of income maintenance can be attained on the basis of&#13;
standard compensation or requires additional compensation.&#13;
9.        Once county negotiations with MOR have been completed, the county in turn&#13;
allocates compensation among the affected individuals and villages.  The country&#13;
typically sets a standard payment for assets of various types, and individuals directly&#13;
negotiate compensation for lost private assets, as do village leaders for expropriated land.&#13;
The village management committee plans and implements resettlements using collective&#13;
compensation funds, restricted by guidelines designed to ensure their use for&#13;
infrastructure development or other investments that improve villager incomes or social&#13;
welfare. The people to be resettled in any given village as a result of Railway VII&#13;
capacity expansion will be handled through these traditional planning mechanisms.&#13;
10.       In order to ensure that the resettlement work is done properly, every local&#13;
government is required to form a 'negotiation and conflict resolution group." They are&#13;
responsible for the coordination of all land acquisition and resettlement-related tasks&#13;
within their jurisdictions. If there are any problems of coordination between the different&#13;
provinces involved in implementation, or between the MOR and any of the provinces, the&#13;
State Planning Commission will resolve the issue. If the issues cannot be resolved by&#13;
SPC, it will be resolved by the State Council. A senior official of the State Council will&#13;
be in charge of project implementation coordination.&#13;
11.       Resettlement Strategies. The nature of the resettlement strategy adopted&#13;
within any one administrative unit depends fundamentally on the nature of displacement&#13;
there. In urban areas, the enterprises are compensated for lost assets and are provided&#13;
suitable sites for reconstructing needed buildings. Enterprise managers were confident of&#13;
plans for altemative location of enterprises and were satisfied with the rates of&#13;
compensation offered.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 127 -                         ANNEX 9&#13;
12.       Requisitioned agricultural land accounts for the bulk of displacement and lost&#13;
productive assets under Railway VII. 7he strategy for dealing with such loss is to&#13;
redistribute all agricultural land within the collective, spreading the burden across the&#13;
collective. If the per capita land holding falls below a certain level (0.1 mu), the affected&#13;
persons will be provided with a job.&#13;
13.       Compensation levels considered adequate to at least restore the standards of&#13;
living of the affected people will be paid. The level of compensation will be related to&#13;
its capacity to help the affected people regain their previous standards of living. For&#13;
those left with unviable landholdings, the land-using unit will arrange to provide&#13;
employment in local enterprises.&#13;
14.       Rural houses will be relocated within the original village. Compensation&#13;
rates for houses were determined at replacement value, with the owner having the right&#13;
to salvage but also responsible for tearing down the old house. A new housing site of&#13;
equal size will be made available, and most of these sites have been selected. The owner&#13;
will be responsible for constructing the new house and will have approximately four&#13;
months in which to do so. A sample of homeowners relocated under earlier railway&#13;
projects revealed a high level of satisfaction with the compensation and other&#13;
arrangements for new housing.2/&#13;
15.       Public assets such as roads, and telephone and power lines to be rerouted,&#13;
will be rebuilt by the appropriate agency of local government. In every case, the&#13;
displacement in minor and the new routes are expected to result in minimal disruption of&#13;
service and inconvenience to users. MOR has earmarked compensation sufficient to&#13;
complete this work.&#13;
16.       Budget and Timetable.   Based  on preliminary budget projections,&#13;
resettlement costs will total Y 140.02 million. The resettlement financing plan is a part&#13;
of the overall project budget. The resettlement timetable presents no extraordinary&#13;
challenges, since resettlement is spread over the entire length of the railway line. MOR&#13;
will pay all resettlement compensation to the local government in advance of&#13;
resettlement, assuring availability of funds when needed. The State Audit Administration&#13;
has assumed responsibility for monitoring the use of resettlement funds. The resettlement&#13;
financing plan has been approved by SPC and is a part of the overall project budget.&#13;
17.       Resettlement Monitoring and Evaluation. The monitoring of progress in&#13;
the resettlement program will be undertaken by the Social Sciences Research Institute&#13;
(SSRI) of Southwest Jiaotong University. The terms of reference for this work require,&#13;
inter alia, that: (i) the monitoring be conducted quarterly beginning in 1994 through such&#13;
time as program objectives are achieve; M&amp;E reports will be submitted every nine&#13;
months to MOR and the World Bank; (ii) monitoring will include all major resettlement&#13;
sites and will utilize standard survey methods; and (iii) in addition to indicators of&#13;

progress in physical works (e.g., land, housing, infrastructure, etc.), indicators selected&#13;
for monitoring shall include standard socioeconomic variables designed to measure the&#13;
well-being of the affected populations. Particular attention will be paid to compensation&#13;
levels. At the end of each year of the project, SSRI will present a summary report of&#13;
their supervision to MOR and the World Bank. If SSRI's investigations find problems,&#13;
SSRI will discuss the solution with the local government and submit to MOR a report&#13;
about handling of the problem. At the end of the project, a report will be prepared&#13;
summarizing the resettlement activities under the project.&#13;

            The Seventh Railway Project will support
            the Ministry of Railways' (MOR) initial efforts to
            implement its 30-point action statement of railway reform.
            The project's main objectives are to assist MOR: 1)
            redefine the relationship between the railway and the
            Government; 2) reshape the railway's organization and
            strengthen its internal management; 3) expand the
            railway's transport capacity, raise its investment
            efficiency, and enhance its finances; and 4) modernize the
            railway's technologies and bolster the efficiency and
            quality of its transport operations and service. To achieve
            these objectives, MOR formulated a series of components on
            policy reform and institutional development (PID),
            investments, and studies. PID components include: 1) railway
            enterprise reform; 2) railway tariff reform; and 3) labor
            productivity enhancement. Investments include: 1) expanding
            corridor capacity; 2) modernizing information systems; 3)
            upgrading telecommunications systems; 4) commercializing
            container transport; 5) enhancing environmental protection;
            and 6) expanding system capacity. The studies include
            components that will provide MOR with the technical
            assistance and software needed to prepare future railway
            projects or to develop and apply new railway technologies
            and management techniques.
