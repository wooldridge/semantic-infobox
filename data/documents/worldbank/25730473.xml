ï»¿ANNEX 2&#13;
Standard Provisions&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of the Administration Agreement for the&#13;
Trust Fund between the Bank and the Donor, it being understood that any plural references in the&#13;
annexes to Donors, Administration Agreements, Contributions and pro rata shares shall be read as&#13;
singular references to the Donor, its Administration Agreement, its Contributions thereunder and the&#13;
remaining uncommitted balance of the Trust Fund, respectively.&#13;
1.     Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1    The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in this&#13;
Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the&#13;
Donors, including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a&#13;
fiduciary or trustee under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration&#13;
Agreement shall be considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles&#13;
of Agreement or any applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2    Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from&#13;
time to time, including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies,&#13;
its framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the&#13;
use of Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to&#13;
the relevant decisions of the Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United&#13;
Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank&#13;
under the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an&#13;
individual member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall&#13;
be kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be&#13;
commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as trustee,&#13;
has legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2    The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United States Dollars (the&#13;
"Holding Currency").&#13;
2.3    Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their&#13;
respective Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency&#13;
other than the Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying&#13;
Deposit Instructions, the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange&#13;
rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to&#13;
complete activities as a result of exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear&#13;
any responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other&#13;
currencies as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date&#13;
of the conversion.&#13;
2.5    The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their&#13;
disbursement in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment of&#13;
trust funds administered by the Bank. The Bank shall transfer all income from such investment to the&#13;

an amount equal to five percent (5 %) per Installment as an administrative fee for the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2    Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust&#13;
Fund Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual&#13;
Contributions significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the&#13;
first Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change,&#13;
the Bank reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section,&#13;
which would be effectuated by amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all Donors&#13;
and which would thereafter be applicable to all new Contributions that are provided either as&#13;
amendments to supplement existing Administration Agreements or from new Donors under new&#13;
Administration Agreements.&#13;

based trust funds as a whole; and (ii) a combined financial statement for all cash-based trust funds&#13;
together with the Bank's external auditor's opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit shall be&#13;
borne by the Bank.&#13;
4.4    If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the&#13;
Bank's external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether&#13;
such an external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope and&#13;
terms of reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank&#13;
shall arrange for such external audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal costs of the&#13;

6.1   It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the Bank&#13;

deposited in the Trust Fund for the purposes of this Administration Agreement (other than returns to&#13;
Donors) after such date to the extent such date is changed in accordance with amendments made to&#13;
the Administration Agreements of all the Donors. Following the End Disbursement Date, the Bank&#13;
shall return any remaining balance of the Trust Fund to each Donor in the Holding Currency in the&#13;
manner specified in its respective Administration Agreement on a pro rata basis with regard to the&#13;
