Private Sector Engagement in Rural Water Supply in the Mekong Region&#13;

Tapping the Market&#13;
&#13;
Paving the Way for Diverse Approaches&#13;
The growing number of small-scale private enterprises providing water to villagers throughout Vietnam and&#13;
Cambodia demonstrates the critical role the local private sector is playing in supplying water to the region.&#13;
This Field Note outlines the key features of this expanding private sector and provides lessons for other&#13;
countries seeking to develop alternative approaches to rural water supply.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     The small-scale private providers operating in Cambodia and Vietnam fall into&#13;
     two distinct categories--either enterprises that sell water directly to consumers&#13;
     or those that provide equipment and know-how to consumers so that they may&#13;
     access water on their own.&#13;

pipe water to individual households.                piped water for their homes are also purchasing untreated water from door-to-door&#13;

     In the early 1990s, private operators, in response to a demand and&#13;
     willingness to pay for water by households, constructed a number of small&#13;
     piped water systems. Functioning in an unregulated environment and sourcing&#13;

            Private sector engagement in rural water
            supply in the Mekong region : tapping the market
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            There are a number of small-scale
            private enterprises providing water services to rural
            villages throughout Vietnam and Cambodia. These include well
            drillers and pump installers, manufacturers and sellers of
            rainwater jars and water filters, individuals who collect
            and transport water for sale, and small companies that pipe
            water directly to individual households. These enterprises
            and their customers have invested in this rapidly expanding
            water market using a variety of financing arrangements with
            little external assistance from the public sector. They are
            able to leverage funds, offer good quality services and
            products, and maintain accountability for any problems or
            issues that arise. This has led to high customer
            satisfaction and increasing sustainability. However, these
            enterprises face several challenges, which include making
            the link between clean water and good health to create
            further demand. Additionally, if this emerging private
            sector is to expand, government and donors must address key
            policy issues, including appropriate regulation and
            subsidies. This Field Note outlines the key characteristics
            of this growing market and provides lessons for other
            countries seeking to expand the role of small-scale
            enterprises in rural water supply.
