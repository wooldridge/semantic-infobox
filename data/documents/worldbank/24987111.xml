&#13;
   Traditional benchmarks to assess performance rely on unconditional rankings or regional&#13;
   averages. This paper uses a recently developed methodology based on quantile&#13;
   regressions and initial conditions to propose alternative benchmarks for social sectors in&#13;
   Kyrgyz Republic. Covering a wide set of indicators, the analysis reveals mixed results for&#13;
   Kyrgyz Republic. The country has made important strides in many social areas, with&#13;
   outstanding results in reducing child mortality and undernourishment. However, other&#13;
   areas are still key challenges and demand further attention and resources, as evidenced&#13;
   by the underachievement in maternal mortality, educational performance, and increasing&#13;
   informality in labor markets.&#13;

I. Introduction 1&#13;
&#13;
This note examines the Kyrgyz Republicâ&#128;&#153;s performance in its social sectors. It uses an&#13;
innovative methodology to create benchmarks based on international experience and the&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s history. The methodology takes into account the countryâ&#128;&#153;s initial conditionsâ&#128;&#148;in&#13;
terms of the initial value of the outcome indicator and other factors, such as GDP per capitaâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
and can be used to assess past progress and set targets for future performance. Thus, the&#13;
analysis is tailored to the countryâ&#128;&#153;s particular situation.&#13;
&#13;
The results of the benchmarking methodology can be summarized in two metrics, which are&#13;
comparable across countries and indicators. The metrics are the raw and the characteristic-&#13;
specific percentiles where the country falls in the raw and the characteristic-specific&#13;
distribution of an indicator (outcome or output), which range from 0 to 100, with higher&#13;
values indicating better performance. The raw percentile captures where the country is&#13;
relative to other countries in the world over a certain period of time, while the characteristic-&#13;
specific percentile indicates whether the performance is below or above what could be&#13;
expected given the countryâ&#128;&#153;s characteristics. Consequently, the results can be easily&#13;
communicated to a non-technical audience, in an intuitive way.&#13;
&#13;
The main results are summarized in an accompanying two-pager flyer that tells the story of&#13;
the social sectors in graphics, mimicking the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#156;Country at a Glanceâ&#128;&#157; template.&#13;

 We thank the peer reviewers: JosÃ© Cuesta, Ana MarÃ­a Oviedo, and Ken Simler; sector specialists working in the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic: Dingyong Hou, Igor Kheyfets, Erkin Mamadaliev, and Gulmira Sultanova; and Asli Gurkan, Aibek&#13;
Baibagysh uulu, and Juliana Flanagan for their suggestions and comments. We also thank Omar Arias for the&#13;
overall guidance provided and Alex Kremer for posing interesting questions that pushed us to ask more of this&#13;
exercise.&#13;

&amp;#12;This can be used to engage policy makers and other stakeholders in the Kyrgyz Republic in a&#13;
dialogue about what social sector-related policies can improve performance, in conjunction&#13;
with more in-depth sector studies.&#13;
&#13;
The remainder of this note is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly introduces the&#13;
benchmarking methodology used for the analysis; it is presented in an intuitive manner for a&#13;
wide non-technical audience, while a formal presentation is deferred to Annex A1. Section 3&#13;
describes the data and the model specifications. Sections 4 and 5 present the main results.&#13;
Section 4 shows the results of a retrospective exercise for the Millennium Development Goals&#13;
(MDGs). We apply the benchmarking methodology to the data that was available at the&#13;
beginning of the millennium when the MDGs were set, and we assess the feasibility of the&#13;
MDGs for the Kyrgyz Republic. Then, Section 5 provides a more comprehensive and current&#13;
description of all social sectors. The benchmarking methodology is applied to a longer&#13;
timeframe and a larger set of indicators. Whenever data limitations prevent the application&#13;
of the benchmarking methodology, some complementary information is included. Section 6&#13;
summarizes the main messages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
II. Benchmarking methodology&#13;
&#13;
Most of the analysis in this note relies on a methodology that was recently applied to assess&#13;
country performance and targets in reducing poverty, and originally developed to evaluate&#13;
standards of performance for government. This is the first application to a wide range of&#13;
social sector indicators and to a large set of developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
This section describes the methodology in an intuitive manner, while the formal presentation&#13;
is found in Annex A1. The methodology aims to maximize the use of information when&#13;
assessing the countryâ&#128;&#153;s performance and can be easily communicated to a non-technical&#13;
audience. It uses information from all countries and a long time series, resulting in a broad&#13;
spectrum of performances. It also provides better benchmarks than those arising from&#13;
rankings or regional averages since it allows the initial conditions and other relevant factors&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               2&#13;
&amp;#12;that might explain performance to be taken into account. Finally, it builds on statistical&#13;
techniques such as cumulative distributions and quantile regressions, but at the same time&#13;
the results can be summarized in two numbers with intuitive interpretation.&#13;
&#13;
The countryâ&#128;&#153;s performance in a certain social sector is measured by the percentileâ&#128;&#148;a number&#13;
ranging from 0 to 100â&#128;&#148;in which the countryâ&#128;&#153;s indicator falls in the cumulative distribution of&#13;
the relevant social sector indicator. The cumulative distribution function is a function that,&#13;
for a certain value of an indicator, gives the percentage of cases that have a lower value. That&#13;
percentage is called percentile.&#13;
&#13;
The performance can be assessed solely in relative terms to other countriesâ&#128;&#148;called raw&#13;
performance hereafterâ&#128;&#148;or taking into account a countryâ&#128;&#153;s characteristicsâ&#128;&#148;called&#13;
characteristic-specific performance hereafter. The raw performance is the percentile in which&#13;
the value of the indicator of the country falls in the raw cumulative distribution function 2 of&#13;
all observed values of such indicator. It is akin to creating a ranking normalized to vary&#13;
between 0 and 100, and evaluating the position of the country in it. Thus, the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
performance depends on the values observed for all other countries during the period under&#13;
examination. As for the interpretation, a value of 50 for the raw performance indicates the&#13;
country in a certain year has performed better than half of the country-year episodes (or&#13;
cases) analyzed in the sample.&#13;
&#13;
Alternatively, the performance can be tested against an estimated distribution that takes into&#13;
account the characteristics of the country. This characteristic-specific performance is the&#13;
percentile where the country falls in the counterfactual cumulative distribution based on its&#13;
characteristics, such as the initial value of the indicator (that is, the starting point), the gross&#13;
domestic product (GDP) per capita, or other factor that might affect the performance.3 The&#13;
counterfactual (cumulative) distribution is estimated using quantile regressions that help to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2&#13;
 Newman et al. (2010) use the term empirical or unconditional distribution to refer to the raw distribution.&#13;
3&#13;
 Newman et al. (2010) use the term conditional performance to refer to the percentile where a country falls in&#13;
the conditional distribution. This note uses the term characteristic-specific performance since it seems more&#13;
accessible to a non-technical audience. The definitions remain the same, however.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      3&#13;
&amp;#12;approximate the variation in the indicator given a set of characteristics. Thus, a value of 25&#13;
for the characteristic-specific performance is interpreted as the country performing better&#13;
than 25 percent of the country-year cases with similar values of the variables controlled for.&#13;
&#13;
In this note, effort is defined as the percentile at which the country needs to perform during&#13;
a certain number of years in order to achieve a previously defined target. As before, effort&#13;
can be measured using two metrics: the raw cumulative distribution or the counterfactual&#13;
characteristic-specific distribution. The effort can also be measured ex ante to make a&#13;
prediction of how much the indicator needs to improve based on past information, or ex post&#13;
taking into account the progress achieved by other countries during the period.&#13;
&#13;
The methodology, however, is only applicable to indicators where good (bad) performance is&#13;
associated with monotonic increases (decreases) of the indicator, or where the indicator can&#13;
be transformed in order to have monotonicity. For example, the indicator spending on social&#13;
protection is not monotonic since more spending is not necessarily associated with better&#13;
performance (for example, more spending can be associated with more coverage for a given&#13;
level of poverty or lower coverage but higher poverty incidence). The indicator pupils-per-&#13;
teacher is not monotonic either, as too many students can be as bad as too few in terms of&#13;
efficiency of delivery. However, if the optimal number of students-per-teacher is known,&#13;
monotonicity can be obtained via a simple transformation: distance to the optimal value.&#13;
&#13;
To implement the methodology, the analyst needs to address a few issues. First, which&#13;
indicator is best suited to measure performance of the outcome of interest? For example, if&#13;
the interest is to assess quality of education, there are several variables produced with&#13;
Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) scores that can be used: the score in&#13;
each subject test, the average score of the three subject tests, the percentage of students&#13;
who perform below level 2 in literacy, and so on. Next, the analyst needs to decide whether&#13;
to work with the variable in levels or in changesâ&#128;&#148;either absolute or in percentages. Second,&#13;
what is the sample under analysis? This measure of performance is relative and thus depends&#13;
on the countries and years used as reference group. For example, the reference group can&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              4&#13;
&amp;#12;include all countries in the world, or all countries in a region, or all countries of similar income&#13;
levels. Third, which variables are used as controls in the quantile regressions needed to&#13;
estimate the counterfactual characteristic-specific distribution? Undoubtedly, all these&#13;
decisions affect the results and depend on data availability. Thus, it is acknowledged there is&#13;
some degree of arbitrariness in the estimation, which is undermined via a series of robustness&#13;
checks.&#13;
&#13;

III. Data and model specifications&#13;
&#13;
The exercise relies on different data sources to gauge the performance of the social sectors&#13;
in the Kyrgyz Republic. The selection of indicators is mainly guided by the data availability and&#13;
requirements of the benchmarking methodology. This is complemented with other data&#13;
sources that help distill the story of the sectorsâ&#128;&#153; performance. The choice of indicators is&#13;
guided by the following criteria:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 5&#13;
&amp;#12;    (i)    Relevance. Indicators were selected based on discussions with sector specialists who&#13;
           provided information and guidance about relevant issues in each area. For example,&#13;
           while primary enrollment is not a concern in the Kyrgyz Republic (as there is almost&#13;
           universal enrollment), pre-primary enrollment isâ&#128;&#148;both in terms of its implications for&#13;
           early childhood development and for the labor force participation of women.&#13;
&#13;
    (ii)   Good coverage of countries and years. In order to have accurate estimates of the&#13;
           characteristic-specific performance, the indicator has to be available for many&#13;
           countries and over a relatively long period of time. The analysis uses data for the&#13;
           period 1990â&#128;&#147;2012 (or latest year available). The exact number of countries and years&#13;
           of data vary by indicator.&#13;
&#13;
(iii)      At least two data points for the Kyrgyz Republic. Since the performance is evaluated&#13;
           in terms of changes, at least two data points for the Kyrgyz Republic are needed. For&#13;
           most of the indicators this was not a constraint, with the exception of social protection&#13;
           performance.4&#13;
&#13;
(iv)       Monotonicity. As discussed above, the methodology sorts values of the indicators&#13;
           across countries and time. Thus, as in any ranking, performance has to be associated&#13;
           with a continuous increasing or decreasing value of the indicator. For example, while&#13;
           there is a consensus that a higher enrollment rate is a positive outcome, there is not&#13;
           similar consensus about the optimal pupil-to-teacher ratio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4&#13;
 In terms of country and time coverage, we have included indicators produced by the Enterprise Survey. These&#13;
data are available only from 2002 onwards, with low frequency and low country coverage. However, some&#13;
estimates were made when enough data were available. We extended the period of analysis to 2013 to increase&#13;
the number of observations. GDP growth projections have been used to build a proxy of the GDP per capita in&#13;
2013, used as a control variable in the estimations. In the case of the international PISA exam, data for the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic is only available for 2006 and 2009. Country coverage is limited, ranging from a minimum of 42&#13;
countries in 2000 to a maximum of 68 countries in 2009. However, we believe it is important to tell the story&#13;
about quality of learning in the Kyrgyz Republic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
All the indicators used are publicly available and can be downloaded using the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Open Data. We included all the MDG indicators that satisfied the conditions (i) to (iv) and are&#13;
associated with social sectors (Box 3.1). Looking at the MDGs is especially relevant as they&#13;
guided policies over the last 15 years. Moreover, setting future targets in line with MDGs and&#13;
post-MDGs indicators has to be an informed process that focuses on efforts and not only on&#13;
outcomes. Only a few other indicators satisfied the above conditions and could be included&#13;
in the analysis. Unless otherwise indicated, we use all the years available for the chosen&#13;
indicators.&#13;
&#13;
Model specifications to estimate the counterfactual characteristic-specific distribution&#13;
&#13;
The characteristic-specific distribution is estimated using the coefficients from quantile&#13;
regressions for each indicator. To evaluate an indicatorâ&#128;&#153;s performance, the explained (or&#13;
dependent) variable is the growth of the indicator expressed as the annual percentage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     7&#13;
&amp;#12;change. Each episode of change (or observation) in the sample is computed using the two&#13;
closest years of data, and then normalizing it annually to make it comparable.&#13;
&#13;
For the quantile regressions we opted to use a parsimonious specification that uses the same&#13;
explanatory variables to assess performance of any sector. The baseline specification for the&#13;
annualized growth rate includes as controls the initial value of the indicator used to compute&#13;
the change, the GDP per capita in the same initial year, the annual growth of GDP per capita&#13;
(also computed over the same period used to calculate the dependent variable), and time&#13;
and region dummies.5 Other sector-specific variables could also be included in the regression&#13;
specification, for example, the fact that government spending in a sector is likely to affect&#13;
outcomes. However, as of today, there is little coverage of disaggregated measures of public&#13;
spending. 6&#13;
&#13;
This note opts for a parsimonious specification instead of one tailored to each sector&#13;
indicator. On the one hand, tailoring the specifications to each indicator requires a deeper&#13;
knowledge of the sector, demanding more of a specialistâ&#128;&#153;s time and involvement than what&#13;
was originally envisioned when the task was commissioned. On the other hand, we&#13;
acknowledge that biases of different magnitude might arise in each tailored specification if&#13;
data constraints affect them in different ways, as well as in this simple specification. We lean&#13;
toward having a simpler and parsimonious specification, even if arbitrary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5&#13;
  The time dummy variables were constructed to indicate five-year periods (1990â&#128;&#147;1994, 1995â&#128;&#147;1999, 2000â&#128;&#147;2004,&#13;
2005â&#128;&#147;2009 and 2010â&#128;&#147;2014) except for PISA indicators, where dummy variables indicate the year of the PISA&#13;
assessment (2000 (omitted), 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2012), and for the Enterprise Survey, where a dummy&#13;
variable indicates the year with available data between 2002 and 2013. The region dummy variables are East&#13;
Asia and Pacific (EAP), Europe and Central Asia (ECA) developing, Europe high income (EHI), Latin America and&#13;
Caribbean (LAC), Middle East and North Africa (MENA), North America (NA), South Asia (SAR) and Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa (SSA). GDP controls are omitted for maternal mortality ratio (modeled) as it is used to compute the&#13;
indicator.&#13;
6&#13;
  The World Bank has recently made progress in having comprehensive, homogeneous, and detailed data on&#13;
public spending. BOOST is a tool applied to treasury data to produce several public spending indicators.&#13;
However, the tool is not yet widely developed to incorporate it into the study. For more information, consult&#13;
http://go.worldbank.org/S14MC5Z9L0.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     8&#13;
&amp;#12;To test the robustness of the results, additional specifications are estimated using (i) a&#13;
different set of controls; and (ii) different samples of country/years. Results are presented in&#13;
Annex A3, and in all cases the qualitative conclusions hold.&#13;
&#13;
Following previous applications (Newman et al., 2010), we estimate 99 percentiles in almost&#13;
all cases. The exception is the undernourishment ratio, since the indicator is bottom-coded:&#13;
no distinction is made among values below 5 percent, which is equivalent to the bottom 22&#13;
percent of the observations in 2012. In this case, for estimations in levels, there is only one&#13;
estimate for the upper quintile, and percentile regressions for the rest of the distribution&#13;
(percentiles 1st to 80th).&#13;
&#13;
In all cases, a higher percentile is associated with better performance of the corresponding&#13;
indicator. Figures have been reversed in the estimation for consistent interpretation across&#13;
indicators in those cases where a higher indicator value reflects a worse situation (such as&#13;
mortality or undernourishment rate).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IV. Assessing progress with the Millennium Development Goals&#13;
&#13;
A backward-looking assessment on progress with the MDGs illustrates the proposed&#13;
benchmarking methodology. Using data up to 2000 (when the MDGs were set) and the&#13;
benchmarking methodology, two main questions are explored: (1) Were the MDGs feasible&#13;
targets for the Kyrgyz Republic? (2) In the last almost 15 years, did the Kyrgyz Republic achieve&#13;
the MDG targets as expected, and did the country outperform or underperform them? This&#13;
retrospective exercise should serve to inform the country when setting post-MDG targets,&#13;
and more generally to help it understand the value of using this additional information.&#13;
Updated information that includes all available years is presented in the section.&#13;
&#13;
To answer the above questions the benchmarks are set based on the information available&#13;
at the beginning of the millennium. The steps followed are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               9&#13;
&amp;#12;    (i)     Focus on MDGs that satisfy conditions (i) to (iv) of Section 3, â&#128;&#156;Data and model&#13;
            specifications.â&#128;&#157; These include undernourishment, primary school enrollment,&#13;
            gender parity in secondary education, under-5 mortality rate, maternal mortality&#13;
            ratio, and incidence of tuberculosis.&#13;
    (ii)    Compute the annualized growth rates for each MDG indicator between 1990 (or&#13;
            earliest available) and 2000 (or latest available).&#13;
    (iii)   Estimate the raw and the characteristic-specific distributions for each MDG&#13;
            indicator to evaluate the raw and the characteristic-specific performance of the&#13;
            Kyrgyz Republic, as described in the previous section.&#13;
    (iv)    Compare the raw and the characteristic-specific performance with the targets set&#13;
            for 2015 for each MDG.&#13;
&#13;
Goal 1â&#128;&#148;Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger.&#13;
&#13;
Hunger measured by undernourishment was relatively high in the Kyrgyz Republic at the&#13;
beginning of the millennium. With 17 percent of the population undernourished in 2000, the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic was in the 56th percentile of the raw distribution for this indicator. This level&#13;
of undernourishment was observed in Turkmenistan in 1993 and in Chile in 1991.&#13;
&#13;
The MDGs set the target of halving the level of undernourishment to achieve an&#13;
undernourishment rate of 9 percent by 2015. 7 This target implied a rate of reduction in&#13;
undernourishment of 4.2 percent per year, which was equivalent to what was observed for&#13;
many Latin American countries in the 1990s, but it represented a harder effort for the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic given its initial position. This rate of progress implied performing above percentile&#13;
87 of the characteristic-specific distribution, considerably higher than the progress achieved&#13;
during the 1990s: the raw performance was at the 51st percentile and the characteristic-&#13;
specific was around the 7th decile. Without any doubt, this was an extremely ambitious target&#13;
for the Kyrgyz Republic. Only one other countryâ&#128;&#148;Azerbaijanâ&#128;&#148;showed this type of progress&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7&#13;
 The MDG target meant to halve by 2015 the global level of undernourishment rate of 1990. However, data for&#13;
the Kyrgyz Republic is available since 1993, obliging us to use this year as the starting point.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    10&#13;
&amp;#12;in the 1990s. 8 In spite of the predictions, the Kyrgyz Republic performed exceptionally well,&#13;
decreasing undernourishment at an average rate of 8.4 percent per year between 2000 and&#13;
2012 and reaching a level of undernourishment of 5.9 percent in 2012. This performance was&#13;
at the level of percentile 99 of the characteristic-specific distribution, based on the&#13;
information available at the beginning of the millennium.&#13;
&#13;
This success story is summarized in Figure 4.1. The yellow dashed line shows the trajectory&#13;
required to achieve the MDG target. The dotted orange line indicates the trajectory&#13;
performing at the 75th percentile, which would have been still a very ambitious target, but&#13;
with higher guarantees of achievement. Finally, the blue line shows the success of the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic in this area, with the actual rate of progress below the two projected lines.&#13;

    indicates the projection of actual undernourishment until 2015, if the Kyrgyz Republic continued to perform&#13;
    at the average rate of the 2000â&#128;&#147;2012 period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

 Azerbaijan reduced undernourishment at a yearly rate of 6.5 percent between 1993 and 2000, from 23.8 to&#13;
14.9 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                            11&#13;
&amp;#12;Goal 2â&#128;&#148;Achieve universal primary education.&#13;
&#13;
Primary enrollment was already high in the Kyrgyz Republic in 1990, with a gross enrollment&#13;
rate close to 110 percent. However, in 2000, primary gross enrollment decreased to 95.8&#13;
percent, an annual decrease rate of 1.4 percent. This implied a raw performance at the 11th&#13;
percentile and a characteristic-specific performance at the 10th percentile. However, there is&#13;
no clear target for this indicator in terms of the MDGs against which to assess performance.&#13;
Between 2000 and 2012, gross primary enrollment has increased again, reaching a level of&#13;
105.9 percent in 2012. Performance between 2000 and 2012 was at the level of the 93th&#13;
percentile of the characteristic-specific distribution. Primary net enrollment also increased&#13;
between 2000 and 2012, from 85.8 percent in 2000 to 90.5 percent in 2012.&#13;
&#13;
Goal 3â&#128;&#148;Promote gender equality.&#13;
&#13;
Equal access to education is instrumental to promote womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment. This can be&#13;
measured by the gender parity index (GPI) in secondary gross enrollment. 9 Gender parity was&#13;
not a concern in the Kyrgyz Republic, as parity was close to 100 between 1990 and 2011. The&#13;
main concern might instead be related to boys leaving school for work. In order to capture&#13;
equal access to education (and to make the indicator monotonic), 10 the indicator is&#13;
constructed as the absolute difference between the gender ratio in secondary gross&#13;
enrollment and the parity valueâ&#128;&#148;that is, the distance to education parity.&#13;
&#13;
Between 1990 and 2000, the distance from total gender equality in secondary enrollment in&#13;
the Kyrgyz Republic increased by 20 percent. This performance placed the Kyrgyz Republic at&#13;
the level of 11th percentile of the raw distribution and 35th percentile of the characteristic-&#13;
specific distribution. When we look at the absolute level of the distance, and after controlling&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9&#13;
  This indicator captures the ratio of female gross enrollment for secondary school to male gross enrollment for&#13;
secondary school, per 100. A GPI equal to 100 indicates parity between females and males. In general, a value&#13;
less than 100 indicates disparity in favor of males and a value greater than 100 indicates disparity in favor of&#13;
females.&#13;
10&#13;
   The benchmarking tool could not be used to evaluate the evolution of the GPI, since results do not have a&#13;
monotonic interpretation. However, distance from 100 can be interpreted in terms of the benchmarking tool.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      12&#13;
&amp;#12;by GDP per capita and regional dummies, the Kyrgyz Republic is at the median of the&#13;
distribution. However, as already discussed, GPI was very close to 100 during the period.&#13;
Besides, between 2000 and 2012, distance from 100 in GPI was reduced again, at an annual&#13;
rate of 15 percent. This yearly performance positioned the Kyrgyz Republic above the 85th&#13;
percentile, based on the information available by 2000 (Figure 4.2 plots the evolution of the&#13;
indicator between 1990 and 2012).&#13;
&#13;
Goal 4â&#128;&#148;Reduce child mortality.&#13;
&#13;
Reducing child mortality by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015 implied moving from 70.5&#13;
deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 23.5 by 2015. In 2012, the mortality rate of children&#13;
younger than 5 was 26.6 deaths per 1,000 live births, which meant the target had been&#13;
reached on time. The target was meaningful as the reduction in the 1990s was of 3.4 percent&#13;
per year.&#13;

 Source: Authorsâ&#128;&#153; calculations based on WDI. Notes: The dashed blue line indicates the projection of actual&#13;
 child mortality until 2015, if the Kyrgyz Republic continued to perform at the average rate of the 2000â&#128;&#147;2012&#13;
 period (done by authors).&#13;
&#13;
The Kyrgyz Republicâ&#128;&#153;s performance in the 1990s was average; it placed the country in the 53rd&#13;
percentile of the raw distribution and the 75th percentile if we take into account its own&#13;
characteristics. This fourth goal target was ambitious, with a required performance at the 87th&#13;
percentile of the country characteristic-specific distribution. But the Kyrgyz Republic did not&#13;
fall short in the new millennium, performing at an average annual rate of -5.1 percent and&#13;
reaching the targeted performance of the characteristic-specific distribution. This evolution&#13;
is summarized in Figure 4.3. Note that even though the Kyrgyz Republic performed as&#13;
expected, the country still lagged behind regional averages.&#13;
&#13;
Goal 5â&#128;&#148;Reduce maternal mortality.&#13;
&#13;
Maternal mortality was a concern for the Kyrgyz Republic circa 2000, with a performance&#13;
below the median of the raw distribution (percentile 47). The country was not improving, as&#13;
maternal mortality rates increased between 1990 and 2000 at an annual rate of 1.6 percent,&#13;
from 85 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 100 deaths by 2000. This rate of change&#13;
placed the Kyrgyz Republic at the 11th percentile of the raw distribution, based on 1990â&#128;&#147;2000&#13;
data, and the 30th percentile of the characteristic-specific distribution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                    14&#13;
&amp;#12;Reducing the maternal mortality rate by three-quarters between 1990 and 2015 meant&#13;
reaching a level of 21 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2015, equivalent to a reduction of 9.8&#13;
percent per year. This was a very ambitious target, and maybe even unfeasible. The Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic was performing at the 30th percentile when its characteristics are taken into&#13;
account, and achieving Goal 5 meant jumping to the 95th percentile of the characteristic-&#13;
specific distribution. Between 2000 and 2013, maternal mortality decreased at an annual rate&#13;
of 2.2 percent. This annual growth rate falls in the 60th percentile of the characteristic-specific&#13;
distribution for the Kyrgyz Republic, based on the evidence available in 2000.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 4.4 summarizes the gap between the target set by the MDGs and the reality in the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic. The solid blue line shows the actual evolution of the Kyrgyz Republic&#13;
between 1990 and 2010, while the dotted blue line shows the projection for 2015 if the&#13;
indicator follows the same pattern for the period 2000â&#128;&#147;2013. The yellow dashed line shows&#13;
how the Kyrgyz Republic would have had to perform between 2000 and 2015 to achieve the&#13;
target set by the MDGs for maternal mortality. The dotted orange line indicates a more&#13;
sensible goal, performing at the 70th percentile of the characteristic-specific distribution,&#13;
while the light blue dotted line indicates a performance at the level of the 75th percentile.&#13;
Even if the country was underperforming during the 2000s, the target set by the MDGs was&#13;
not realistic for the Kyrgyz Republic. A target at the level of the 75th percentile of the&#13;
characteristic-specific distribution would have been easier to reach.&#13;
&#13;
Goal 6â&#128;&#148;Combat HIV, malaria, and other diseases.&#13;
&#13;
A lack of information makes us unable to apply the methodology to focus on HIV, so only the&#13;
incidence of tuberculosis is examined here.11 The incidence of tuberculosis was 92 cases per&#13;
100,000 people in 1990 and increased to 249 cases in 2000. However, after a few years of&#13;
stabilization, it started to decrease. The increase in the incidence of tuberculosis at an annual&#13;
rate of 10.5 percent per year between 1990 and 2000 meant a performance for the Kyrgyz&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11&#13;
  Incidence of tuberculosis includes only new detected cases, while prevalence of tuberculosis includes both new&#13;
and previous cases. Incidence of tuberculosis was the chosen indicator for this section since it is the data typically&#13;
used to monitor the achievement of the MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                           15&#13;
&amp;#12;Republic at the level of percentile 6 of the raw distribution and the 19th percentile of the&#13;
characteristic-specific distribution.&#13;
&#13;
To halt the incidence of tuberculosis required a performance at the level of 80th percentileâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
equivalent to a growth rate of zero. However, between 2000 and 2012, the incidence of&#13;
tuberculosis decreased at a rate of 4.6 percent per year, equivalent to a performance at the&#13;
99th percentile.&#13;

 Source: Authors, based on WDI. Notes: The maternal mortality rate is estimated only every five years between&#13;
 1990 and 2010, and for 2013. The maternal mortality ratio is estimated per 100,000 live births.&#13;
&#13;
In summary&#13;
&#13;
Overall, the Kyrgyz Republic has performed exceedingly well when it comes to the MDGs in&#13;
social sectors, achieving more than what could have been expected considering the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
historical performance and the international experience. This is summarized in Table 1.&#13;
However, two important qualifiers are warranted. First, the big exception is maternal health:&#13;
even with almost universal access to skilled birth attendance, the maternal mortality rate is&#13;
still high. A target at the level of percentile 75 of the characteristic-specific distribution in&#13;
2000 required a reduction of 3.7 percent per year.&#13;
&#13;
Second, although the Kyrgyz Republic has achieved outstanding progress, this does not mean&#13;
in any way it is sufficient. For example, child mortality rates are still behind regional averages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                       16&#13;
&amp;#12;While the trend in the incidence of tuberculosis was reversed, this disease is still a concern&#13;
to address in the future, as identified in the Den Sooluk plan. In education, although levels of&#13;
enrollment in primary education are high, the Kyrgyz Republic has work to do on the quality&#13;
of education and early childhood development. This becomes clearer in the next section,&#13;
which goes beyond this set of indicators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
V. Benchmarking progress in the social sectors going forward&#13;
&#13;
This section assesses progress over a larger set of social sectors during the last decade. Results&#13;
are mainly based on the application of the benchmarking methodology and the preferred&#13;
specification explained in Section 3. Subsections are organized according to the thematic&#13;
global practices.&#13;
&#13;
Health, nutrition, and population&#13;
&#13;
The 2012â&#128;&#147;2016 National Health Reform Program, Den Sooluk, identifies some of the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republicâ&#128;&#153;s most relevant challenges to overcome in the following years, many of which&#13;
overlap with the MDGs. These include improve child and maternal health, eradicate&#13;
infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis, and decrease hunger. The benchmarking&#13;
analysis seeks to identify past performance and set feasible though meaningful targets for&#13;
the future.&#13;
&#13;
In short, Manas and Manas Taalimiâ&#128;&#148;the health reforms that have defined a plan for the&#13;
modernization of the health systemâ&#128;&#148;have paid off. It has been said that the clear priorities,&#13;
realistic goals, and coherent sequencing of reforms were keys to success (Balabanova et al.,&#13;
2013).&#13;

&amp;#12;Maternal health. Maternal health is an area at which more effort could be directed. Maternal&#13;
mortality has diminished during the last decade at a good rate based on the progress during&#13;
the 1990s. The number of deaths per 100,000 live births first increased from 85 in 1990 to&#13;
100 in 2000, to later decrease to 79 in 2010 (the last year of available data). According to the&#13;
raw distribution, this indicator falls in the 51st percentile for 2010. However, when controls&#13;
are included, maternal mortality falls in the 13th percentile of the characteristic-specific&#13;
distribution. This result reflects how urgent is to improve maternal health in the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic.&#13;
&#13;
Measured in percentage change, the performance is poor. The Kyrgyz Republic falls in the&#13;
33rd percentile of the characteristic-specific distribution. A reasonable and significant post-&#13;
MDG target could be to reduce maternal mortality at rate of 5.6 percent per year, which is&#13;
equivalent to performing at the 75th percentile in the characteristic-specific distribution in&#13;
2013.&#13;
&#13;
The teenage fertility rate is a related aspect of maternal health included in the MDGs. The&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic has made considerable progress in this area. The number of births per 1,000&#13;
teenagers decreased from 68.4 in 1992, to 34.4 in 2002, to 29.8 in 2012. The Kyrgyz Republic&#13;
outperformed between 1997 and 2002, when the adolescent fertility rate decreased at a&#13;
yearly pace of 11.5 percent. In the last 5 years, the characteristic-specific performance has&#13;
stagnated around the 10th percentile (with an annual decrease of 0.3 percent), but this is&#13;
typical of countries with low levels of teenage pregnancy. If the Kyrgyz Republic wants to&#13;
maintain the performance of the past, at the 75th percentile for example, the teenage fertility&#13;
rate should decrease at an annual rate of 4.7 percent.&#13;
&#13;
There is now almost universal skilled birth attendance, and nearly all women receive prenatal&#13;
care. 12 Some argue that the lack of larger response of the maternal mortality ratio is related&#13;
to the need for further quality improvements in health delivery, while others say it is an&#13;

Child health. The assessment of child mortality drives more optimistic results. Between 2000&#13;
and 2012, neonatal mortality, infant mortality, and under-5 mortality rates have been&#13;
decreasing steadily (see Figure 5.1).&#13;

 Source: UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation. Notes: Neonatal mortality is the number of&#13;
 newborns who die before reaching 28 days of life, per 1,000 live births. Infant mortality is the number of&#13;
 infants who die before reaching one year of age, per 1,000 live births. Under-5 mortality is the probability per&#13;
 1,000 that a baby will die before the age of five.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
For the three indicators, child mortality is around the median of the raw distribution&#13;
(measured in levels), but around the 40th percentile of the characteristic-specific distribution.&#13;
Although the country is behind regional averages, with higher mortality rates than the&#13;
average of ECA developing countries, the characteristic-specific performance seems to be&#13;
better. When we look at the growth rate in the last period (2011â&#128;&#147;2012), the Kyrgyz Republic&#13;
performed above the 85th percentile, both in the raw and the characteristic-specific&#13;
distribution; the ECA region, as an aggregate, performed around the 70th percentile of the&#13;
characteristic-specific distribution. 13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
13   As expected, the estimations for ECA developing as an aggregate did not include regional dummies.&#13;

&amp;#12;Vaccination is an important instrument for decreasing child mortality. In particular, the share&#13;
of immunization against measles among children in the 12â&#128;&#147;23 months group is included as a&#13;
MDG. Coverage in the Kyrgyz Republic is almost universal (98 percent both in 2000 and 2012)&#13;
and then does not seem to be a concern.&#13;
&#13;
Summing up, both maternal and child mortality have been reduced in the last 20 years.&#13;
However, there is still much room for improvement. Figure 5.2 benchmarks the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic against a top performer like Japan. This country had high maternal and neonatal&#13;
mortality rates at the beginning of the twentieth century but made important achievements.&#13;
As of 2010, Japan was at the 95th percentile of the raw distribution of maternal mortality,&#13;
with 6 deaths per 1,000 live births; 14 in 2011 it was at the 99th percentile of the raw&#13;
distribution of neonatal mortality, with only 1.1 deaths per 1,000 live births.&#13;

Nutrition and health. Improvements in health can also be quickly assessed by examining a&#13;
few outcome indicators such as undernourishment, and the incidence of a few key diseases.&#13;
For example, undernourishment has sharply fallen in the last 15 years, from 16.8 in 2000 to&#13;
&#13;
14&#13;
     World Bank, 2014a.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                              21&#13;
&amp;#12;5.9 percent in 2012. Performance has been particularly outstanding in the last observed year,&#13;
with a 22.4 percent drop between 2011 and 2012. This rate of decrease corresponds to the&#13;
98th percentile of the raw distribution and the 94th percentile of the characteristic-specific&#13;
distribution. As was discussed above, the Kyrgyz Republicâ&#128;&#153;s performance was outstanding,&#13;
largely exceeding the targets set by the MDGs in 2000.&#13;
&#13;
The prevalence of tuberculosis has shown a similar evolution to the incidence of tuberculosis&#13;
discussed earlier. While the prevalence rate was 449 cases per 100,000 persons in 2000, it&#13;
was halved by 2012. However, a big effort still needs to be made to fully eradicate this&#13;
disease. The level of this indicator is only at percentile 35 of the raw distribution and at the&#13;
40th percentile of the characteristic-specific one. A target of performance at the level of the&#13;
75th percentile of the characteristic-specific distribution would imply reducing the&#13;
tuberculosis prevalence rate by 6.9 percent per year. If this target were reached, tuberculosis&#13;
prevalence would be, by 2023, similar to the regional average in 2012â&#128;&#148;around 100 cases per&#13;
100,000 population (see Figure 5.3).&#13;

&amp;#12;Some other diseases are not studied here because of a lack of worldwide data with long time&#13;
series, and require more attention if the populationâ&#128;&#153;s health is to be improved over the next&#13;
few years. In particular, it is worth highlighting the case of cardiovascular diseases, which&#13;
account for almost half of all deaths in the Kyrgyz Republic each year (50.1 percent in 2011). 15&#13;
HIV is also an issue, though there is considerably less valid information on this problem.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Education&#13;
&#13;
In the Kyrgyz Republic, equitable access to education is only achieved on some levels. While&#13;
almost everybody is enrolled in primary and secondary education, enrollment in preschool&#13;
among children 3 to 5 is very low, and with strong variation across the oblasts. For example,&#13;
preschool enrollment is 32 percent in Bishkek and 8.5 percent in Osh and Batken. Similarly,&#13;
the quality of education varies widely across the country (Cahu, 2014). Also, the countryâ&#128;&#153;s low&#13;
quality of tertiary education, coupled with a large increase in the number of institutions, is&#13;
also a major concern that should be addressed in the following years. The National&#13;
Sustainable Development Strategy for 2013â&#128;&#147;2017 points toward the reform of the&#13;
educational system as an urgent issue.&#13;
&#13;
Access to education. There is almost universal enrollment in primary and secondary&#13;
enrollment, with gross rates close to 100. However, the story is different for preschool and&#13;
tertiary levels (see Figure 5.4), with slow growth during the first 12 years of the millennium.&#13;
In particular, enrollment in pre-primary school is still a challenge. As of 2012, pre-primary&#13;
enrollment was only 25 percent, well below pre-primary enrollment in other countries of the&#13;
region such as Armenia (51%), Georgia (58%), Kazakhstan (54%), Moldova (80%) and the&#13;
Russian Federation (90%). 16 Countries with similar or lower pre-primary enrollment rates&#13;
than Kyrgyz Republic are Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan (25%), Bosnia and Herzegovina (16%) and&#13;
Tajikistan (9%).&#13;

&#13;
 Source: WDI. Notes: Gross enrollment ratios include students in a corresponding school level, independent of&#13;
 the studentâ&#128;&#153;s age. Gross enrollment rates may be higher than 100 percent if the total number of students&#13;
 exceeds the population of the age group that officially belongs to a certain school level for reasons such as&#13;
 early enrollment, late enrollment, and/or grade repetition. Figures for secondary and tertiary enrollment&#13;
 correspond to 2011 (the last year of data availability).&#13;
&#13;
Between 2000 and 2012, the country more than doubled its pre-primary enrollment rate,&#13;
moving up in the raw distribution of the indicator from the 16th percentile in 2000 to the 26th&#13;
in 2012 (or percentile 22 of the characteristic-specific distribution). Although at first glance&#13;
the change could be perceived as substantial, there is still much room for improvement: pre-&#13;
primary enrollment is still lower than it was before the transition to the market economy and&#13;
behind regional averages (45 percent in 2012). However, when focusing on the last few years,&#13;
the Kyrgyz Republic shows an outstanding performance. Between 2011 and 2012, pre-&#13;
primary enrollment rate increased by 19 percent, a characteristic-specific performance at the&#13;
95th percentile. With a target growth set at the 75th percentile of the raw distribution (that is,&#13;
7.8 percent per year), the Kyrgyz Republic could double its pre-primary enrollment rate by&#13;
2021.&#13;
&#13;
Regarding tertiary enrollment, there are two points worth mentioning. First, between 2010&#13;
and 2011 the Kyrgyz Republic performed at only the 19th percentile of its characteristic-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     24&#13;
&amp;#12;specific distribution, with a negative (annual) growth rate of 1.9 percent. Second, tertiary&#13;
enrollment might not be the best indicator by which to evaluate, since there are other factors&#13;
stemming from the labor market, as well as the quality of tertiary education, which may be&#13;
more relevant to assess the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s current situation. As discussed in the National&#13;
Sustainable Development Strategy (2013â&#128;&#147;2017), educational content needs to be urgently&#13;
reformed to make tertiary education both relevant and compatible with the needs of the&#13;
national labor market.&#13;
&#13;
Education attainment. To evaluate educational attainment, we use the Barro-Lee data.17 The&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic increased the average years of schooling of those 25 years or older from 8.1&#13;
in 1990 to 9.3 in 2010. Progress slowed in the last 5 years, with an annual growth rate of 0.2&#13;
percent. This is in line with a performance only below the level of the first decile of the&#13;
characteristic-specific distribution. One could think that the low performance is typical of&#13;
countries with high achievement. However, after controlling for GDP and time and regional&#13;
dummies, the level of this indicator is at the 4h percentile of the characteristic-specific&#13;
distribution.&#13;
&#13;
A substantial target at the 75th percentile of the characteristic-specific distribution implies a&#13;
0.8 percent annual growth rate in the average years of schooling. This target would increase&#13;
education to 10.4 years by 2025, a level that is similar to the 2010 educational attainment of&#13;
other countries of the ECA region, such as Armenia, Albania, and Kazakhstan.&#13;
&#13;
Quality of education. Improving the quality of education is one of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s major&#13;
challenges and priorities. Outcomes for the internationally standardized PISA exams indicate&#13;
the educational systemâ&#128;&#153;s failure to provide children with the relevant tools to become&#13;
integrated in future labor markets. The Kyrgyz Republic was a bottom performer both in 2006&#13;
and 2009, with low achievements in math, reading, and science. 18 However, the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic is the poorest country among those collecting information on education quality.&#13;
&#13;
17&#13;
  Data cover the period 1970â&#128;&#147;2010.&#13;
18&#13;
  The Kyrgyz Republic did not take part in the PISA assessments in 2000, 2003, and 2012, and will not participate&#13;
in PISA in 2015. However, even if not updated, data from PISA assessments in 2006 and 2009 are the most&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       25&#13;
&amp;#12;We chose to measure quality of education with the indicator share of students below Level&#13;
1A in the PISA reading test. This is typically known as functional illiteracy. 19 Students are not&#13;
illiterate per se, but rather those who perform below Level 1A are unable to reach a reading&#13;
proficiency needed to successfully undertake daily lifeâ&#128;&#153;s most basic reading tasks (see Annex&#13;
A2). In 2006, 70.5 percent of the 15-year-old students who participated in the exam&#13;
performed below Level 1A in reading. The Kyrgyz Republic improvements translated in lower&#13;
share of students below Level 1A reaching 59.4 percent in 2009 (Figure 5.5).&#13;
&#13;
The progress between 2006 and 2009, equivalent to a yearly reduction of 5.5 percent, was&#13;
quite good compared to other countries but very poor for the Kyrgyz Republic. The country&#13;
performed at the 62nd percentile of the raw distribution, but below the 10th percentile of the&#13;
characteristic-specific distribution.&#13;

 Source: Authors, based on WDI and PISA. Notes: Functional illiteracy is defined as the percentage of students&#13;
 below Level 1A in the reading exam (see Annex A2). Projections are based on the assumption of progress at&#13;
 the 75th percentile of the characteristic-specific distribution of changes measured in percentage points for&#13;
 the Kyrgyz Republic starting in 2009, which is the latest year information is available for the country.&#13;
&#13;
We forecast the evolution of the Kyrgyz Republic in this indicator setting a target at the 75th&#13;
percentile of the characteristic-specific distribution of change. This target would better&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
reliable evidence available regarding learning outcomes in the country. In 2009, the Kyrgyz Republic had average&#13;
grades of 331 points in math, 314 points in reading, and 330 points in science.&#13;
19&#13;
   Similar results are obtained when math or science are considered instead of reading. Also, outcomes are&#13;
qualitatively similar when the scores are considered, rather than the shares of students below the lowest level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        26&#13;
&amp;#12;position the Kyrgyz Republic, with only 21 percent of students functionally illiterate in 7 years.&#13;
This share would be closer to 36 percent with a more conservative target at the 50th&#13;
percentile.20&#13;
&#13;
In sum, students face a variety of educational opportunities and learning conditions in&#13;
underperforming schools. Among the factors affecting learning are low coverage of preschool&#13;
education, late entrance into primary school, overloaded school curricula, and the use of&#13;
outdated teaching and learning methods not in line with international best practices.&#13;
Spending efficiency is low across the education system, and sector financing sustainability is&#13;
threatened by large outlays on wages following rapid wage growth during 2010â&#128;&#147;2012, with&#13;
high shares of resources going toward food and utility costs. Lack of investment in the&#13;
necessary teaching and learning materials contributes to low education quality, with Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic students scoring at the bottom of 2009 PISA international learning assessments.&#13;
Also, the examination system is still based on Soviet principles and has yet to be aligned with&#13;
the market economyâ&#128;&#153;s requirements (World Bank, 2009). These issues clearly impact the&#13;
labor market, as reported, for example, by employers in the Enterprise Survey of 2013.&#13;
Around 33.1 percent of surveyed firms identified the inadequately educated workforce as a&#13;
major constraint, saying that workers do not match firmsâ&#128;&#153; requirements. Coverage remains&#13;
low in pre-primary education, while equitable education service provision varies widely&#13;
across localities and social groups. The practices surrounding education sector governance&#13;
could also be improved and aligned with international standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Social protection and labor&#13;
&#13;
High employment rates and productive jobs are fundamental for growth, both to reduce&#13;
dependence on social assistance and more generally to improve standards of living. In this&#13;
section we review the results of applying the benchmarking methodology to select labor&#13;
market and social protection indicators. However, many of the most common and&#13;
&#13;
20&#13;
  As opposed to the rest of the analysis, these results are presented in percentage points instead of percentage&#13;
rate of change. In addition, time and regional dummies were not included in the estimations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      27&#13;
&amp;#12;informative indicators cannot be used because of data limitations or because they cannot be&#13;
transformed into an indicator that is monotonically associated with improvement.&#13;
&#13;
Labor Markets. At first glance, the Kyrgyz Republic appears strong in labor market indicators.&#13;
The employment-to-population ratio is higher than the regional average and the Organisation&#13;
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average for all the years considered.&#13;
Youth unemployment is lower than the regional average and close to the OECD rate during&#13;
most years (except for peaks in 1998 and 2002; see Figure 5.6).21&#13;

The benchmarking tool has been used to evaluate the performance of the country in four&#13;
different indicators: the unemployment rate (as a percentage of the total labor force); the&#13;
youth unemployment rate (for 15- to 24-year-olds); the employment-to-population ratio (for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
21&#13;
  Figures for unemployment, labor force participation, and the employment-to-population ratio are estimated&#13;
on an annual basis. For the purpose of our analysis, it would be preferable to rely on national data for labor&#13;
market indicators instead of using estimations provided by the ILO. However, as it was previously suggested,&#13;
data for various years is not available for several countries, and cross-country comparability issues also arise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                       28&#13;
&amp;#12;the 25 years and older population); and the female labor force participation (for 15- to 64-&#13;
year-olds). Looking at levels for each of these in 2012, the Kyrgyz Republic is close to the&#13;
median in the raw distribution but above percentile 80 in the characteristic-specific&#13;
distribution (except for female labor force participation).&#13;

In the four cases, changes in the indicators for 2011â&#128;&#147;2012 have gone in the â&#128;&#156;rightâ&#128;&#157; direction:&#13;
unemployment has decreased (by 3.8 percent for youth and 2.3 percent in the case of total&#13;
unemployment), and female labor force participation and employment-to-population ratio&#13;
have increased (0.5 and 0.8 percent, respectively). In all cases, performance during the last&#13;
period (2011â&#128;&#147;2012) was at the level of 75th percentile or higher of the characteristic-specific&#13;
distribution for the Kyrgyz Republic. Figure 5.7 summarizes this information, showing the&#13;
percentiles in the observed distribution for the four indicators in 2012, both in levels and&#13;
annual growth rates. Results for employment-to-population ratio are quite robust when only&#13;
the adult population (25 and older) is included. Although in this case performance between&#13;
2011 and 2012 was at the median of the raw distribution for the Kyrgyz Republic, it was&#13;
around percentile 75 of the characteristic-specific distribution. Relying on the indicator for&#13;
the adult population solves the potential non-monotonicity of the interpretation of this&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;indicator for youth population (that is, a higher employment-to-population ratio for 15- 24-&#13;
year-olds might be associated with a reduction in schooling). 22&#13;
&#13;
GDP per person employed was used to assess the evolution of labor productivity. The Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic is only at the third decile of the raw and characteristic-specific distribution.&#13;
However, the country performed at the level of the 69th percentile of the characteristic-&#13;
specific distribution between 2011 and 2012, with a decrease of 0.6 percent in GDP per&#13;
person employed during that period.&#13;
&#13;
The National Sustainable Development Strategy (2013â&#128;&#147;2017) highlights the weak links&#13;
existing between professional education and the requirements of national, regional, and&#13;
global labor markets. The percentage of enterprises identifying an inadequately educated&#13;
workforce as a major constraint has been rising steadily in the last 10 years, from 6.1 percent&#13;
in 2002 to 33.6 percent in 2013. 23 These numbers are well above the (unweighted) average&#13;
for the ECA region, which is 13.8 percent. Only two other countriesâ&#128;&#148;Moldova and Romaniaâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
have similar levels to the Kyrgyz Republic. Moreover, the country has a large share (compared&#13;
to ECA) of unskilled workers among all production workers (25.7 and 21.1 percent,&#13;
respectively, in 2013).&#13;
&#13;
More promising, the pace of the increase in the share of firms with unmet educational&#13;
requirements slowed down between 2009 and 2013, though this is a not a stunning&#13;
performance for the country. 24 The annualized growth rate of this indicator is at the 6th decile&#13;
of the raw distribution, and at the median of the characteristic-specific distribution (Figure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22 Unfortunately, we could not adjust female labor force participation in the same manner. Thus, the results&#13;
should be taken with caution as the indicator is violating one of our assumptions.&#13;

   Enterprise Surveys for years 2002, 2003, 2005, 2009, and 2013. Unweighted regional averages have been&#13;
calculated considering those countries belonging to the ECA region for which data for the 2013 Enterprise Survey&#13;
is available.&#13;
24&#13;
   GDP per capita for 2013 is not available in WDI at the time this note was written. For that reason, GDP per&#13;

&amp;#12;5.8). 25, 26 Firms are making efforts to improve these shortcomings by increasing the formal&#13;
training offered to workers (63.5 percent of firms offered formal training in 2013).&#13;
Performance of this indicator in the last period (2009â&#128;&#147;2013) was exceptional, at the level of&#13;
the 90th decile of the predicted distribution.&#13;

Informality in the labor markets is a great concern in the Kyrgyz Republic. In 2009, 59.2&#13;
percent of non-agricultural workers were employed in the informal sector. The share is higher&#13;
for men (65.4 percent) than for women (50.7 percent); and in rural areas (63.5 percent) than&#13;
in urban areas (54.7 percent). Informality in labor markets can aggravate the deterioration of&#13;
the contributor to pensioner ratio, with a negative effect on the social protection system.&#13;
According to the National Sustainable Development Strategy (2013â&#128;&#147;2017), the ratio of&#13;
employed citizens to retired ones is slightly above one, while the ILO advises for a ratio closer&#13;
to three contributors per each pensioner. This problem is exacerbated by the increasing&#13;
number of migrant workers, who do not contribute to the social system. Also, according to&#13;
data coming from the Household Budget Survey (HBS), 20 percent of youths are neither in&#13;
school nor in the labor market (NEETs). The number of temporary workers might also be a&#13;
proxy of the informality in the labor markets. This indicator was in 2012 only at the first decile&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
25&#13;
   Most of the results for the indicators coming from the Enterprise Survey are based on estimations for 9 deciles.&#13;
The reduced number of observations made these estimations more reliable than those for 99 quantiles.&#13;
26&#13;
   Estimations for indicators coming from the Enterprise Survey exclude time dummies when the percentiles&#13;
for the benchmarking rates are computed.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;of the observed and the characteristic-specific distributions for the Kyrgyz Republic. Between&#13;
2009 and 2013, the number of temporary workers increased by 14.8 percent.27&#13;
&#13;
Summing up, the Kyrgyz Republic has a higher employment-to-population ratio and lower&#13;
unemployment than the regional average (considering only developing countries in the ECA&#13;
region). Female labor force participation declined by about 8 percent between 1990 and&#13;
2012, even though it is above regional averages. However, the fall in this indicator, coupled&#13;
with a steady increase of female labor force participation in OECD countries, reversed the&#13;
relation existing until 2002 (when female LFP was higher in the Kyrgyz Republic than in the&#13;
OECD).&#13;
&#13;
Social protection. Enhancing effectiveness of social assistance expenditure, including its&#13;
impact on poverty, is one of the key challenges facing the social assistance system in the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic. Non-contributory social protection expenditure doubled between 2008 and&#13;
2011. Levels of coverage are high, and close to those of countries with high levels of poverty&#13;
in the ECA region (In Figure 5.9, panel a, the Kyrgyz Republic is to the left with respect to other&#13;
countries with similar levels of poverty incidence). However, performance of the system in&#13;
terms of coverage of the poor, targeting accuracy, and impact on poverty did not improve.&#13;
For example, for the same level of coverage, targeting is relatively low in the Kyrgyz Republic&#13;
compared to other countries (Figure 5.9, panel b).&#13;
&#13;
Given the nature of social protection indicators, we could not apply the benchmarking&#13;
methodology to them, as none satisfied the conditions (i) to (iv) of Section II â&#128;&#156;Benchmarking&#13;
methodology.â&#128;&#157; By swiftly looking at the outcomes, we can highlight the following facts of the&#13;
sector in the Kyrgyz Republic: 28&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   A large share of the population continues to be poor, despite the significant decline&#13;
         on poverty over the last decade.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
27&#13;
   Estimations for the number of temporary workers also control by the number of permanent full-time&#13;
workers, also obtained from the Enterprise Survey.&#13;

                              with the MBPF being the most efficient program reducing the poverty gap, followed&#13;

VI. Summary&#13;
&#13;
This assessment of the social sector outcomes based on benchmarking methodology reveals&#13;
that the Kyrgyz Republic has made important strides in many social areas, often achieving&#13;
more than expected, especially once the Kyrgyz Republicâ&#128;&#153;s initial conditions are taken into&#13;
account. However, there are key areas that demand attention, and in some cases even&#13;
further resources. Most of these areas are rightly identified by the country in its sector&#13;
development plans, and described in depth in recent analytic products produced by the&#13;
World Bank (2014b, 2014c).&#13;
&#13;
In the area of health, the Kyrgyz Republic has exhibited outstanding progress in reducing&#13;
undernourishment and child mortality. During the first decade and half of the new&#13;
millennium, the country performed at the maximum expected for its initial positionâ&#128;&#148;that is,&#13;
the initial levels of the indicator, the initial GDP per capita, and the growth of the GDP per&#13;
capita. The country achieved the 99th and 87th percentiles in the characteristic-specific&#13;
distribution. Regarding vaccinations and non-communicable diseases, however, lack of data&#13;
has prevented us from applying the benchmark methodology. However, the analysis of the&#13;
data corroborates the messages transmitted in other World Bank reports (World Bank,&#13;
&#13;

although multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is a concern. Despite this, challenges remain when&#13;
it comes to non-communicable diseases, especially for chronic and cardiovascular ones that&#13;
are a major cause of death in the country&#13;

                                                                 35&#13;
&amp;#12;indicators (2013). For levels, characteristic-specific percentiles are based on estimations, including the GDP per&#13;
capita and time and regional dummies. For growth rates, characteristic-specific percentiles include the initial&#13;
value of the indicator in each period of change, the GDP per capita, the GDP per capita growth rate, and time&#13;
and regional dummies. For modeled maternal mortality, GDP and GDP per capita growth have been excluded&#13;
from the estimations. Estimations for indicators from the Enterprise Survey in rates exclude time dummies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In the area of maternal mortality, the country performed at the 60th percentile of the&#13;
expected distribution of 1990â&#128;&#147;2000. This performance has not been enough to achieve the&#13;
MDG, and the analysis let us conclude that the target was simply too high for the country,&#13;
and the performance was not significantly below a more realistic target at the 75th percentile.&#13;
Some argue that part of the problem relates to measurement issues in maternal mortality, as&#13;
there is almost universal access to skill birth attendance and prenatal controls, and some&#13;
differences between national and model estimates. Thus, in going forward, the country&#13;
should focus on addressing the measurement issues as well as improving efficiency in the&#13;
delivery of maternal health.&#13;
&#13;
In education, the picture is also mixed, with the Kyrgyz Republic showing high levels of access&#13;
to education in primary and secondary levels while low levels in pre-primary and tertiary&#13;
ones. The progress has been also uneven, depending on the level, fantastic improvements for&#13;
pre-primary, where the enrollment rate increased by 19 percent, a performance at the 95th&#13;
percentile of the characteristic-specific distribution between 2011 and 2012. In this area, the&#13;
country needs to continue with this high level of performance for the next decade if it wants&#13;
to achieve similar levels of enrollment to those observed in OECD counties. However, the big&#13;
challenges of the country are tertiary education, and more importantly quality of education&#13;
achievement. Improvements in achievement were also low, with the country placed below&#13;
the first decile of the characteristic-specific distribution for the indicator of annual growth in&#13;
(average) years of education. The performance of the Kyrgyz Republic in terms of progress in&#13;
the annual growth of the percentage of functional literacy was extremely low: at the 6th&#13;
percentile of the characteristic-specific distribution.&#13;
&#13;
In-depth analysis of the sector suggests that in order to improve the outcomes on these&#13;
lagging areas, the country needs to tackle the low efficiency of the education system, address&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       36&#13;
&amp;#12;issues of financial sustainability (as there are massive outlays on wages that are not&#13;
translating into higher education quality), and, more generally, improve the governance of&#13;
the sector by adopting and reaching international standards.&#13;
&#13;
When it comes to employment, the Kyrgyz Republic seems to be performing well, with high&#13;
levels of employment and low levels of unemployment. However, a closer look at the&#13;
dynamics of the labor market might raise some flags of alert. Informality seems to be growing,&#13;
as well as the percentage of NEET youth, and the incipient fall in female labor force&#13;
participation. If the country wants to take advantage of this stage of growth, it becomes very&#13;
important that it focus on setting clear targets to maintain high levels of formal and&#13;
productive employment for all groups of the population. The benchmark methodology&#13;
employed in this analysis can be of help in setting credible and feasible targets that proved&#13;
useful in the health sector.&#13;

&amp;#12;Annex A1. Methodology&#13;
&#13;
Country performance in a certain social sector is measured by the percentile in which the&#13;
country falls in the distribution of the relevant social sector indicator. By distribution we refer&#13;
to the cumulative distribution function thatâ&#128;&#148;after sorting all values of the indicatorâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
denotes for each value of the indicator the percentage of cases that have a lower value. The&#13;
percentile indicates the percentage of the casesâ&#128;&#148;in our case countriesâ&#128;&#148;that have a value&#13;
below that observed for the country. Figure A1.1 shows the graphic representation of the&#13;
two concepts.&#13;

&#13;
The performance can be assessed relative to the outcomes of other countriesâ&#128;&#148;which we will&#13;
call raw performanceâ&#128;&#148;or also taking into account the countryâ&#128;&#153;s characteristicsâ&#128;&#148;which we&#13;
will call characteristic-specific performance. The raw performance is the percentile in which&#13;
the country falls in the raw distribution; that is, the cumulative distribution function of all&#13;
observed values of the indicator. For example, a value of 50 of the observed performance&#13;
indicates that the country has performed better than half of the countries in the sample.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                40&#13;
&amp;#12;The characteristic-specific performance is the percentile where the country falls in a&#13;
characteristic-specific distribution that takes into account the countryâ&#128;&#153;s key characteristics&#13;
such as its initial position or per capita GDP. The predicted distribution is a counterfactual&#13;
distribution estimated using quantile regressions over the whole sample of countries and&#13;
country-specific information.&#13;
&#13;
Consider the case in which we are interested in explaining the yearly change in PISA scoresâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
measured in pointsâ&#128;&#148;and take into account the initial conditions in terms of quality of&#13;
education. To maximize the information we include in all the episodes of change of the&#13;
indicator based on all countries and years available. The first step is to estimate quantile&#13;
regressions like the following:&#13;
&#13;
                                             â&#136;&#134;í µí±&#140;í µí±&#140;í µí±&#150;í µí±&#150; = í µí»½í µí»½í µí±&#158;í µí±&#158; í µí±&#140;í µí±&#140;0í µí±&#150;í µí±&#150; + í µí¼&#128;í µí¼&#128;í µí±&#150;í µí±&#150;&#13;
&#13;
where â&#136;&#134;í µí±&#140;í µí±&#140;í µí±&#150;í µí±&#150; is the annual change in the PISA score for episode i, í µí±&#140;í µí±&#140;0í µí±&#150;í µí±&#150; is the initial value of PISA&#13;
used to compute change episode â&#136;&#134;í µí±&#140;í µí±&#140;í µí±&#150;í µí±&#150; , í µí»½í µí»½í µí±&#158;í µí±&#158; is the estimated coefficient of quantile regression&#13;
for quantile q, and í µí¼&#128;í µí¼&#128;í µí±&#150;í µí±&#150; is an error term. There are N episodes of change that can be estimated&#13;
for C countries over T years. Next, the estimates of the quantile regression are combined with&#13;
the country (episode) values to compute the predicted distribution of changes given country&#13;
characteristics as follows:&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Indicators selected for the benchmarking exercise&#13;
&#13;
Health, nutrition, and population&#13;
&#13;
Undernourishment (% of population). This indicator is available at the Health, Nutrition and&#13;
Population database and is originally elaborated on by the FAO. The indicator is constructed&#13;
with the following caveats: 1) It is bottom-censored. The indicator takes on a value of 5 every&#13;
time that the undernourishment rate is estimated to be lower than 5 percent. This may&#13;
introduce some bias in the exercise, because it is impossible to calculate in an accurate way&#13;
the growth rate for this indicator in all cases that it takes on a value of 5 for a certain year and&#13;
country. 2) Data for this indicator are not available for developed countries, which may&#13;
introduce a source of bias in the estimations.&#13;
&#13;
Teenage fertility rate (birth per 1,000 women, 15â&#128;&#147;19 years old). Data on this indicator has&#13;
been obtained from the UN World Population Prospects. Estimations are performed for five-&#13;
year intervals. For the exercise, data was imputed to the middle year of the interval, as was&#13;
done in the WDI database. However, estimations included in the WDI database for the&#13;
remaining years of each interval have been disregarded.&#13;
&#13;
Maternal mortality ratio (modeled estimate, per 100,000 live births). This estimator&#13;
accounts for the number of women who die from pregnancy-related causes while pregnant&#13;
or within 42 days of pregnancy termination per 100,000 live births. The data are estimated&#13;
by WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, the World Bank, and the United Nations Population Division with a&#13;
regression model using information on the proportion of maternal deaths among non-AIDS&#13;
deaths in women ages 15â&#128;&#147;49, fertility, birth attendants, and GDP.31 Estimations are&#13;
presented every five years. The use of GDP as a control variable in the quantile regressions&#13;
may affect the validity of the estimations. National estimates would be a preferable source&#13;
of data for the benchmarking exercise. However, national estimates were not used in the&#13;

only available 2003, 2006, 2008, and 2009.&#13;
&#13;
Child mortality indicators. Three different indicators are used: a) neonatal mortality rates&#13;
(per 1,000 live births)â&#128;&#148;this is the number of newborns who die before reaching 28 days of&#13;
life, per 1,000 live births; b) infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births)â&#128;&#148;this is the number of&#13;
infants who die before reaching one year of age, per 1,000 live births; and c) the under-5&#13;
mortality rate (per 1,000)â&#128;&#148;this is the probability per 1,000 that a newborn will die before the&#13;
age of five. The three indicators are annually estimated by the UN Inter-agency Group for&#13;
Child Mortality Estimation (UNICEF, WHO, World Bank, UN DESA Population Division) and are&#13;
available at at www.childmortality.org.and the Health Stats database. 32&#13;
&#13;
Tuberculosis prevalence ratio (per 100,000 population). This indicator measures the number&#13;
of illnesses, accidents, or sick persons per 100,000, including patients with HIV. Estimations&#13;
for this indicator are made on an annual basis by the WHO. The difference between&#13;
prevalence of tuberculosis and incidence of tuberculosis is the second indicator only takes&#13;
into account new tuberculosis cases, while prevalence includes both new and old cases. 33&#13;
&#13;
Immunization, measles (% of children ages 12â&#128;&#147;23 months): this estimator is provided by&#13;
WHO and UNICEF and measures the percentage of children ages 12â&#128;&#147;23 months who received&#13;
vaccination before 12 months or at any time before the survey. A child is completely&#13;
immunized against measles after receiving one dose of the vaccination. 34&#13;
&#13;
Education&#13;
&#13;
Enrollment ratios. For all school levels (pre-primary, primary, secondary, and tertiary)&#13;
quantile regressions were run and results were presented for gross enrollment ratios instead&#13;
of net enrollment ratios. Gross enrollment ratios include students in a corresponding school&#13;
level, independently of the studentâ&#128;&#153;s age. Total number of students may exceed the&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;population of the age group that officially belongs to a certain school level for reasons such&#13;
as early enrollment, late enrollment, and/or repetition. For that reason, gross enrollment&#13;
rates may be higher than 100 percent in some cases.&#13;
&#13;
Average years of total schooling, age 25+, total. Data for this indicator are obtained from the&#13;
Barro-Lee dataset and are available at The World Bank Group EdStats data portal. This dataset&#13;
on educational attainment contains series for 146 countries, from 1950 to 2010. Data are&#13;
disaggregated by gender and at five-year age intervals. Attainment is estimated for total&#13;
schooling and for different educational levels. 35 The last year of data availability is 2010. In&#13;
particular, estimations in this exercise use data for the average years of total schooling for&#13;
the age group 25 and older. Criteria for selection of this indicator are twofold: 1) using total&#13;
schooling instead of primary, secondary, or tertiary schooling avoids issues of country&#13;
comparability in terms of number of years for formal education; and 2) the age group 25 and&#13;
older is expected to have finished formal education, and this indicator accounts for the total&#13;
stock of education.&#13;
&#13;
PISA. Performance below Level 1A. In 2000, 2003, and 2006, PISA assessments used a&#13;
proficiency scale from Level 1 to Level 5. However, in 2009 and 2012 the scale was modified&#13;
to include Level 1B, Level 1A, and Levels 2 to 6. In order to harmonize the data for different&#13;
years, an indicator â&#128;&#156;Performance below Level 1A in Readingâ&#128;&#157; was built with the following&#13;
caveats: 1) Data used to construct the indicator comes from the EdStats database at the&#13;
World Bank. 2) For 2000, 2003, and 2006, data for performance below Level 1A is not&#13;
available at EdStats, while data for performance at Level 1A is included under the indicator&#13;
â&#128;&#156;PISA: 15-year-olds by reading proficiency level (%). Level 1Aâ&#128;&#157; in EdStats. Then, the indicator&#13;
for â&#128;&#156;Performance below Level 1 in readingâ&#128;&#157; is calculated as a difference of 100% and the&#13;
indicators in the categories Level 1A and Level 2 to Level 5. 3) In 2009 and 2012, the Level 1&#13;
was disaggregated between Level 1A and 1B. To allow comparability, â&#128;&#156;Performance below&#13;

below Level 1B and those performing at Level 1B.&#13;
&#13;
Labor Markets&#13;
&#13;
Employment-to-population ratio (15+) (ILO estimates). This indicator is measured as the&#13;
share of working age population in a country that is employed in a certain period and country.&#13;
ILO estimates are harmonized to account for differences in national data, methodology, and&#13;
data coverage. Data for this indicator can be found at the Key Indicators of the Labor Market&#13;
(KILM) database and may differ from national estimates. 36 A high employment-to-population&#13;
ratio is not necessarily associated with decent work in a country. Besides, a low employment-&#13;
to-population ratio is not a negative outcome per se. For example, a high employment-to-&#13;
population ratio among youth may reflect a lack of access to the educational system.37 In all&#13;
cases, a complete assessment of labor market conditions should be complemented with&#13;
additional indicators to account for decenet employment and labor informality. However,&#13;
there is a consensus of the relevance of this indicator for country comparisons. Employment-&#13;
to-population rate has even become one of the four indicators selected to monitor the&#13;
achievement of target 1b of the MDGs.38 In this exercise, we assumed that a higher value of&#13;
the indicator is associated with a better outcome for the country.39&#13;
&#13;
Employment-to-population ratio (25+) (ILO estimates). This indicator is estimated with the&#13;
same consideration as employment-to-population ratio (15+), presented above. However, it&#13;
excludes youth in the age group 15â&#128;&#147;24 and focuses only on the adult population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
36&#13;
   The series includes both nationally reported and imputed data. Estimates are based mainly on nationally&#13;
representative labor force surveys, with other sources (population censuses and nationally reported estimates)&#13;
used only when no survey data are available (World Bank, World Development Indicators database).&#13;
37&#13;
   The indicator used in this exercise uses data for the population aged 15 and older. It would have been&#13;
preferable to use data for the age group 25â&#128;&#147;64, to avoid issues associated with differences in the school system.&#13;
However data for this age group was not available.&#13;
38&#13;
   The target 1b of the MDG is â&#128;&#156;achieving full and productive employment and decent work for all, including&#13;
women and young people.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
39&#13;

&amp;#12;Female labor force participation rate (15â&#128;&#147;64 years old) (ILO estimates). This indicator&#13;
measures the share of 15â&#128;&#147;64 females that are economically active, either by working or&#13;
looking for a job. This provides an estimate of the size of the labor force that is available for&#13;
the production of goods and services. In particular, monitoring the evolution of female labor&#13;
force participation may be very relevant in those countries where women are not typically&#13;
engaged in labor markets. The same considerations that apply for the employment-to-&#13;
population ratio apply for this indicator. 40&#13;
&#13;
Unemployment rate (15â&#128;&#147;64 years old) (ILO estimate). This indicator measures the share of&#13;
the labor supply that is currently employed but is actively looking for a job. Together with the&#13;
employment-to-population ratio, this is a typical indicator used to monitor the evolution of&#13;
the labor market in a country. Although unemployment is not a desirable situation, low&#13;
unemployment rates in developing countries may be masking weak safety nets or&#13;
unemployment insurance, which make it unbearable for people to be unemployed. In these&#13;
cases, low unemployment rates may be associated with lack of decent work and labor&#13;
underutilization. The same considerations that apply for the employment-to-population ratio&#13;
apply for this indicator.41&#13;
&#13;
Youth unemployment (15â&#128;&#147;24 years old) (ILO estimates). Youth unemployment refers to the&#13;
share of youth that are currently unemployed but who are actively looking for a job. The same&#13;
considerations that apply in the case of unemployment apply for this indicator.42 Although&#13;
not explicitly included in the exercise, NEETs (not in education, employment, or training) are&#13;
a relevant indicator to get a more complete overview of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s young population. NEETs&#13;
are those who are not engaged in the labor market but are not in school. A high proportion&#13;
of NEETs may reflect both a poor quality education system and weak access and lack of&#13;
opportunities for a countryâ&#128;&#153;s young population.&#13;

&amp;#12;GDP per person employed (constant 1990 PPP USD). This indicator measures the GDP&#13;
divided by the total employment in a given country. Purchasing power parity (PPP) GDP is&#13;
GDP converted to 1990 constant international dollars using PPP rates. This indicator is a proxy&#13;
of labor productivity, which is used to assess a countryâ&#128;&#153;s economic ability to create decent&#13;
employment opportunities with fair and equitable remuneration. Increase in labor&#13;
productivity is relevant from a social perspective since it can improve social protection and&#13;
reduce poverty. Country comparability issues may arise when using this indicator.&#13;
&#13;
Share of firms identifying an inadequately educated workforce as a major constraint (%).&#13;
This indicator is obtained from the Enterprise Survey. 43 This survey is based on firm-level&#13;
microdata, obtained from a representative sample of the private sector in each country. This&#13;
specific question is based on the respondentâ&#128;&#153;s opinion of which are the major constrains for&#13;
a firmâ&#128;&#153;s growth in the country. Interpretation of the results may take into account potential&#13;
sample bias (not all the countries are surveyed in all the periods). In particular, in the case of&#13;
the Kyrgyz Republic, data for the Enterprise Survey is available for five years. However, for&#13;
most countries it is only available for at most two or three years. Observations are lost for&#13;
those countries for which data is available for only one year. Besides, data for the Enterprise&#13;
Survey only covers the period 2002â&#128;&#147;2013.44&#13;
&#13;
Share of unskilled workers (out of all production workers) (%). Data for this indicator also&#13;
come from the Enterprise Survey. The same caveats that apply for the previous indicator&#13;
apply here (see footnote 41). In particular, data for this indicator is constrained to&#13;
manufacturing firms.&#13;
&#13;
Number of temporary workers. Data for this indicator was obtained from the Enterprise&#13;
Survey. This indicator captures the number of short-term and full-time workers employed by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

   The Enterprise Surveys conducted in the Eastern Europe and Central Asian countries are also known as&#13;
Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Surveys (BEEPS). These surveys are jointly implemented by&#13;
the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.&#13;

&amp;#12;the firm throughout the fiscal year. These employees have no guarantee of their contract&#13;
being renewed. This variable might be a proxy of work informality and may also reflect the&#13;
inflexibility of firms to contract long-term workers.&#13;
&#13;
Percent of firms offering formal training. Data for this indicator come from the Enterprise&#13;
Survey. This indicator measures the share of firms that offer formal training programs to their&#13;
permanent, full-time workers.&#13;

&amp;#12;Annex A3. Robustness checks&#13;
&#13;
This annex summarizes the results of the benchmarking exercise, considering different&#13;
specifications of the main regressions presented in Section 5.&#13;
&#13;
Panel A of Table A3.1 presents the same specifications as in Section 5, but excludes time and&#13;
regional dummies. Panel B of the table includes a single dummy for ECA, irrespective of the&#13;
countriesâ&#128;&#153; income level.&#13;
&#13;
Table A3.2 presents the benchmarking exercise when the sample of years and countries is&#13;
changed. Panel A restricts the sample to ECA countries (considering all income levels) and&#13;
includes time dummies every five years. Panel B slightly changes the baseline sample,&#13;
excluding observation prior to 1993 and including time dummies. Finally, Panel C removes&#13;
the last observation for each country, computing the percentiles for the previous year with&#13;
the available data and for the penultimate percentage change.45&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

  Specifications in Panel B and C of Table A3.2 are modifications to baseline specification in Panel A of Table&#13;
A3.1. Regional dummies were not included in these specifications.&#13;

&amp;#12;Abstract&#13;
&#13;
Traditional benchmarks to assess performance rely on unconditional rankings or regional&#13;
averages. This paper uses a recently developed methodology based on quantile regressions&#13;
and initial conditions to propose alternative benchmarks for social sectors in Kyrgyz Republic.&#13;
Covering a wide set of indicators, the analysis reveals mixed results for Kyrgyz Republic. The&#13;
country has made important strides in many social areas, with outstanding results in reducing&#13;
child mortality and undernourishment. However, other areas are still key challenges and demand&#13;
further attention and resources, as evidenced by the underachievement in maternal mortality,&#13;
educational performance, and increasing informality in labor markets.&#13;
