Economic Background and the Transport Sector&#13;
LITHUANIA&#13;
HIGHWAY PROJECT&#13;
I. ECONOMIC BACKGROUND AND THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A. Economic Overview&#13;
1.1    Lithuania, with a population of 3.7 million people and GDP per capita of US$ 2050 in 1995,&#13;
is the largest of the Baltic countries, with a territory of 65,200 square miles. Since its independence&#13;
in March 1990, Lithuania has shown its commitment to both stabilization and structural reforms as&#13;
the first independent republic of the Former Soviet Union (FSU). It has adopted policies such as&#13;
monetary discipline and currency reform, decreasing energy subsidies, privatization, and has initiated&#13;
social assistance reform and financial sector restructuring. The benefits of previous and present&#13;
policies are becoming visible. Inflation has decreased from an annual rate of over 1020 percent in&#13;
1992 to 410 percent in 1993, 65 percent in 1994, and 31 percent in 1995, while real GDP has grown&#13;
slightly in 1994 and 1995.&#13;
1.2   The Bank's overall objective is to support Lithuania's efforts to accelerate structural reforms&#13;
and to undertake efficient investments in high priority sectors. This objective will be pursued through&#13;
a combination of lending operations, analytical sector work, and aid coordination. It is now&#13;
appropriate for the Bank to support Lithuania's transport infrastructure since the economy is at a stage&#13;
in the transition process where substantial public investments are required to overcome the backlog of&#13;
deferred maintenance and to reorient the infrastructure sector to meet the new demands of private&#13;
production and trade. Analytical work by the Bank has assisted the Government in formulating and&#13;
implementing a sound public investment program, in which transport sector infrastructure and&#13;
privatization have been identified as priority areas.&#13;
B. Overview of the Transport Sector&#13;
1.3    Overall, Lithuania has a relatively good road infrastructure, along with the physical&#13;
infrastructure for the other parts of the transport system (maritime, railways, and aviation). The&#13;
motorways are of high geometric standard but not always with a corresponding pavement standard.&#13;
Substantial sections of main roads have narrow carriageways, requiring widening and strengthening as&#13;
the heavy weight traffic increases. The gravel roads often have a poor surface standard caused by&#13;
poor materials and insufficient maintenance.&#13;
1.4    While Lithuania's transport infrastructure is basically adequate, it suffers from low levels of&#13;
maintenance, primarily due to the constrained fiscal resources available during recent years. The&#13;
physical infrastructure is deteriorating and there is a growing backlog of deferred maintenance. Many&#13;
sections of the road network are already in a critical stage and will fail unless they are given adequate&#13;
maintenance and strengthening. Many bridges suffer from no maintenance, some to the extent that&#13;
their structural soundness is in doubt. A similar situation exists in the cities of Vilnius and Kaunas,&#13;
where due to the lack of funds, periodic maintenance and rehabilitation of streets have been postponed&#13;
for the last four to five years, and consequently the urban infrastructure is rapidly deteriorating.&#13;
Major expenditures on maintenance and rehabilitation are thus required to prevent further&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

2                                               Economic Background and the Transport Sector&#13;
deterioration of the capital stock, to avoid the need for costly reconstruction later, and to keep vehicle&#13;
operating costs at a reasonable level. Recognizing the problem, the Government has already obtained&#13;
a loan from EBRD for improvements in the transport sector (see para. 2.17), but the project will only&#13;
address a small part of the deferred maintenance needs of the road network.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Highway Sub-Sector                                                              3&#13;
II. THE HIGHWAY SUB-SECTOR&#13;
A. The Highway Network&#13;
2.1   Public Roads. The total road network in Lithuania is about 45,000 km. The roads owned&#13;
and maintained by the national Government include 21,109 kmn of the main roads in the country,&#13;
10,493 km of which are paved. These national roads are divided into three categories: Highways&#13;
(1,444 km), Regional roads (3,408 kam), and District roads (16,257 kcm). The Highways include 376&#13;
km of European standard motorways serving the highest density routes (Vilnius-Kaunas-Klaipeda and&#13;
Vilnius-Panevezys). The two main road corridors of international significance are Klaipeda-Kaunas-&#13;
Vilnius-Minsk and Tallinn-Riga-Kaunas-Warsaw, known as Via-Baltica. The system also includes&#13;
1477 bridges, 28 of which are wooden.&#13;

Regional Roads (Krasto)              3,292            116            3,408&#13;

Total                               10,493           10,616          21,109&#13;
2.2   Paved Roads. The paved roads in the national road network have the following types of&#13;
surfaces:&#13;
Asphalt-concrete   55%&#13;
Asphalt-macadamn   44%&#13;
Cement-concrete      1 %&#13;
2.3    Other roads. About 10,000 km of municipal roads and about 14,000 km of other roads are&#13;
not included in the national road network, most of which have gravel surfaces. The non-municipal&#13;
roads used to be the responsibility of state enterprises, farms, cooperatives, but most of them have&#13;
now become the responsibility of local governments that in many cases lack the financial and&#13;
technical capacity to maintain them. The issues related to the maintenance of these roads have not yet&#13;
been addressed, and even the basic information regarding their location, lengths, and conditions is not&#13;
well established.&#13;
2.4    Urban Infrastructure. The poor condition of urban infrastructure is due primarily to the&#13;
shortage of funds, although the lack of quality control during construction and outdated road&#13;
maintenance machinery also contribute to rapid deterioration of the roads and increasing wear and tear&#13;
on vehicles. The responsibility for planning, programming and scheduling of maintenance for urban&#13;
roads lies with the Departnents of Civil Works at the City Municipalities, but most of the funds for&#13;
urban infrastructure come from the Central Govermment. At this time, a substantial part of the&#13;
municipal street network, for example about 60 percent in Vilnius, is in critical condition and needs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                                 The Highway Sub-Sector&#13;
periodic maintenance or rehabilitation. The condition of the infrastructure is having an adverse effect&#13;
on the operating costs of vehicles, with a consequent increase in the operating costs of both public and&#13;
private transport.&#13;
2.5   Traffic. The average daily traffic for the main roads is based on continuous traffic counts. In&#13;
1995 the ADT ranged from 10,500 vehicles per day near Vilnius, 13,300 vehicles per day near&#13;
Kaunas and 5,300 vehicles per day near Panevezys, with over 13,300 vehicles per day on some&#13;
sections of the main roads. Traffic figures are generally lower for the rest of the national road&#13;
network, and traffic is very light for most of the local roads. The 1995 ADT of 13,300 vehicles per&#13;
day on the East-West Highway near Kaunas compares with an ADT of about 5,000 vehicles per day&#13;
for the same section in 1993, reflecting the apparent rapid increase in economic activity that is taking&#13;
place in the country. Much of the increase in traffic is for trucking, in some cases with heavy axle&#13;
loads for which the roads were not built.&#13;
2.6    Adequacy of the Road Network. The road density is 0.32 km/sq kIn, twice the density of&#13;
Hungary and nearly four tirnes that of Poland. In relation to population, the density is 54&#13;
inhabitant/sq km, which is about 50 to 75 percent that of the Nordic countries, but per capita car&#13;
ownership is only about one-third as high despite quite rapid growth since 1989 (see Table 2.2).&#13;
Therefore, the overall road density appears to be adequate.&#13;
Table 2.2: Number of Passenger Cars&#13;
Year  ~     ITotal (000)                      Per 1,000 inhabitants&#13;

1990                         478                          128&#13;
1991                         511                          136&#13;
1992                         543                          145&#13;
1993                         592                          159&#13;
1994                         654                          176&#13;
1995                         704                          189&#13;
2.7    Road Conditions. Under the Government's stringent stabilization program aimed at reducing&#13;
inflation, the LRA's 1994 budget was reduced in real terms to less than one-fourth of the 1988 level&#13;
(see para. 2.22). Even the budgeted amount was not made available to the LRA until after the end of&#13;
the fiscal year, since funds are only released on a monthly basis depending upon actual revenue&#13;
collections. Under these conditions LRA had to cut back on its pavement maintenance operations in&#13;
1994 even more than in 1993. The strategy that LRA adopted was virtually to eliminate new&#13;
construction and paving operations, to cut back on surface overlays, and to maintain the maximnum&#13;
possible surface dressings and spot repairs. This strategy has kept most pavement surfaces in&#13;
reasonably good condition, but with an increase in roughness and the progression of rutting for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Highway Sub-Sector                                                                    5&#13;
more heavily travelled parts of the road network. It has also built up a considerable backlog of&#13;
maintenance that will need to be done in addition to the annual requirements that will accrue in each&#13;
future year.&#13;
B. Road Safety&#13;
2.8    The road safety situation in Lithuania is poor by international standards, with 1,094 fatalities&#13;
in 1991 (2.9 per 10,000 population), falling to 779 in 1992 as traffic declined with the economic&#13;
slowdown but rising again in 1993 as traffic increased. This level of fatalities is comparable to&#13;
Estonia and Latvia, but is one and one-half to three times higher than in other countries with a&#13;
comparable level of motorization such as Malaysia, Greece, Ireland, Argentina, and Uruguay. The&#13;
decline in the rate of fatalities in 1994 and 1995 is primarily the result of the Government's decision&#13;
to make the use of seatbelts mandatory. Road accidents will likely increase again as economic&#13;
activity accelerates unless road safety is radically improved.&#13;

2.9    Several road safety studies made in other countries have found that irnprovements in road&#13;
safety depend on the concerted actions of many agencies working together. With this objective in&#13;
mind, the Government in Lithuania established a Road Safety Commission in July 1994, chaired by&#13;
the Minister of Transport. The Comrnmission members include the Deputy Ministers and other officials&#13;
responsible for traffic safety within relevant ministries and municipalities, e.g. the Ministry of Internal&#13;
Affairs, the Ministry of Education, and the cities of Vilnius and Kaunas. The Commission receives&#13;
staff support from the Department of Environmental Protection and Road Traffic Safety (DERS) in&#13;
the Ministry of Transport, which has drawn up a draft National Road Safety Plan and road safety&#13;
legislation for submission to the Parliamnent. However, a lack of staff experienced in traffic safety&#13;
issues, enforcement of traffic regulations, necessary equipment and a critical lack of funds to&#13;
implement physical improvements presently hampers all traffic safety activities. Another inhibition to&#13;
improved road safety is a general lack of public awareness about the problem.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                                               The Highway Sub-Sector&#13;
C. Highway Orgnization&#13;
2.10   The Lithuanian Road Administration (LRA), which has responsibility for the maintenance and&#13;
construction for the national road network, operates under the authority of the Ministry of Transport.&#13;
After Independence in 1990, the LRA, which had consisted of an array of publicly owned design,&#13;
maintenance and construction companies, went through a massive reduction in staff (from 12,000 to&#13;
6,000) under the pressures of a reduced budget and the privatization of 12 of the road and bridge&#13;
construction companies and some of the design institutes. From 1993 until mid-1995, LRA was&#13;
composed of a central administrative office and 42 District Offices that were responsible for carrying&#13;
out both routine and periodic road maintenance. The LRA central administrative office was and still&#13;
is responsible for the following functions relating to the national road network:&#13;
i.    overall planning for road construction and&#13;
maintenance;&#13;
ii.   road and bridge standards and specifications; and&#13;
iii.   supervision of road construction and maintenance.&#13;
The present internal organization of LRA is shown in Annex A.&#13;
2.11   Each bistrict Office had an equipment pool, a storage and spare parts depot and an equipment&#13;
repair facility. Starting in mid-1995, LRA reduced the number of District Offices by combining 38&#13;
of them into ten Regional Road Administrations that will handle the routine and winter maintenance&#13;
for the ten Regions of the country and one Administration that is responsible for the routine and&#13;
winter maintenance of the major highways. The remaining four District Offices will be reorganized&#13;
into State Joint Stock Companies that will remain public corporations for the time being, but are&#13;
expected to function as construction companies without subsidies and to obtain their revenues from&#13;
work obtained on contract to public or private entities. These four companies are to be privatized in&#13;
1997.&#13;
2.12   Eguipment. The LRA and its district offices had the following mnajor equipment in operating&#13;
condition in 1994:&#13;
Asphalt plants      53&#13;
Pavers              40&#13;
Motor Graders       273&#13;
Bitumen Spreaders    42&#13;
Mobil Cranes         63&#13;
Bitumen Tanks        22&#13;
Bulldozers          154&#13;
Excavators          239&#13;
Lorries             471&#13;
Light Cars          126&#13;
Water Tanks          52&#13;
Rollers             213&#13;
Front End Loaders    87&#13;
Snow Blowers        21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Highway Sub-Sector                                                                  7&#13;
Scrapers               5&#13;
Sand Spreaders       365&#13;
Tractors             430&#13;
Most of this equipment is old and of poor design, requiring extensive maintenance and in some cases&#13;
providing poor results. LRA has privatized about 70 percent of its asphalt mixing plants.&#13;
2.13 Personnel. Currently, LRA has 60 staff members in its headquarters in Vilnius, with the&#13;
number of staff limited by Executive Decree and by a budget that specifies the level for the LRA&#13;
Administrative Office separately from the rest of the LRA budget. There were about 100 to 150&#13;
employees in each District Office before the reduction in the number of organizations responsible for&#13;
routine and winter maintenance as described in para. 2.11. The level of the staffs of the successor&#13;
organizations have been increased to reflect the increased size of the road networks under their&#13;
responsibility. The result of these various organizational changes has been a further reduction in the&#13;
total staff of LRA to about 4200 persons.&#13;
2.14   LRA personnel appear to be competently trained in basic engineering skills. However, the&#13;
engineering staff has been isolated from the advances in road techniques developed in the Western&#13;
economies over the past fifty years. Also, at the time of Independence, there was a general lack of&#13;
awareness on the part of LRA's staff of the value of and techniques for using cost analysis as a basis&#13;
for making choices regarding pavement management strategies, materials and equipment, although&#13;
this is now changing through increasing contact with Western road institutions through aid-financed&#13;
technical assistance, seminars and travel grants. For example, extensive assistance has been provided&#13;
by EU-Phare for a program of institutional support including a study of LRA's organizational&#13;
structure. Support to develop a road data bank and a Pavement Management System (PMS) has been&#13;
provided by Sweden. The Danish Government is providing assistance in procurement practices,&#13;
preparation of bidding documents, contract supervision, and bridge repair management.&#13;
2.15   Economic Evaluation. Pavement Research and Testing and Engineering Design. LRA has a&#13;
close working relationship with the Transport and Road Research Istitute (TRR1), an independent&#13;
state-owned institution that carries out highway surveys, feasibility studies, and bridge inspections for&#13;
LRA. TRRI relies entirely on fees and contracts from the work that it performs for its revenues.&#13;
LRA also has a close working relationship with another state- owned institution called Problematica&#13;
that performs testing on materials and pavements samples, assists LRA in paveinent design, and&#13;
carries out road pavement research. Problematica is paid by LRA on the basis of the work that it&#13;
performs, and it also does testing on a fee basis for other state-owned and private institutions and&#13;
companies. It has established good contacts with Western sources of information, and is current on&#13;
the latest road pavement technology. A third organization, Kelprojektas, is a privatized former state&#13;
design institute that carries out road design, including the preparation of specifications and bidding&#13;
documents for LRA on a fee basis. While TRRI, Problematica and Kelprojektas all appear to be&#13;
competent organizations that work closely with LRA, there appears to be a lack of coordination&#13;
between the four organizations, which limits their effectiveness in establishing cost-effective pavement&#13;
design strategies.&#13;
2.16   Performance Level. On the whole, LRA has performed competently in the past judging from&#13;
the condition of the road networks as well as by its level of technical skills and knowledge, and&#13;
appears to operate at a high level of professionalism. The constraints on its performance have been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                                                                The Highway Sub-Sector&#13;
those imposed by restrictive budgets during the past several years, by LRA's lack of access to modem&#13;
highway maintenance technology, and by the need in the past to rely on raw materials and equipment&#13;
that were generally of poor quality.&#13;
2.17   Municipal Road Organizations. The responsibility for planning, programming and scheduling&#13;
of maintenance for urban roads lies with the Departments of Civil Works at the city municipalities,&#13;
with the physical work usually carried out by the municipalities' own staffs. Most of the funds for&#13;
urban infrastructure, however, come from the Central Government. In 1995, approximately 23&#13;
million Litas (US$6 million) was spent in Vilnius, Kaunas, and Siaulai. This amount represents only&#13;
about 25 to 50 percent of the budget required to maintain the network at an appropriate service level.&#13;
The staffs of the Departments of Civil Works include competent engineers who have successfully&#13;
carried out the maintenance of the city streets in the past on a force account basis. They have begun&#13;
to use contracting procedures for some of their periodic maintenance requirements during the last few&#13;
years. However, they are not yet familiar with the use of economic analysis for deciding which&#13;
streets to repair and what level of repair to carry out, or with contracting based on competitive&#13;
bidding procedures, contract management, and quality control of the contractors' work.&#13;
2.18   Relationship with EBRD Project Activities. There is an EBRD project presently under&#13;
implementation that includes 800 km of surface dressing and 72 km of overlays as well as one&#13;
municipal bypass, at a total project cost of US$12 million. Implementation of the project, originally&#13;
scheduled to begin in 1994, was delayed because of cross-conditionality with a co-financier, but is&#13;
now under way. This project will not meet all of Lithuania's deferred maintenance requirements, but&#13;
will help LRA become familiar with multi-lateral bank lending and procurement practices.&#13;
2.19   Another EBRD-supported project, to be co-financed by JEXIM and the European Investment&#13;
Bank, is under preparation. It will finance improvements of the part of the Lithuanian road network&#13;
that is included in Via Baltica, a North-South route that links Helsinki with Poland and Germany&#13;
through the Baltic countries. This project, at a total cost of US$ 64.2 million, is expected to be&#13;
processed on the same time schedule as the proposed Highway Project. There has been a careful&#13;
assessment of the timing, work program and financial requirements of the two EBRD-financed&#13;
projects to assure that they complement each other and that the combined impact on the LRA budget&#13;
and staff is manageable.&#13;
D. Highway Maintenance Planning and Budgeting&#13;
2.20   Planning and Expenditure Procedures. Prior to independence, the predecessor organization to&#13;
the LRA obtained its budget from the central government in Moscow. Traditionally 20 year road&#13;
development programs were prepared and updated every five years. Since independence, budgets are&#13;
requested through the MT to the Ministry of Finance on an annual basis. Major projects are&#13;
submitted with a separate justification and reviewed in the context of an overall Public Expenditure&#13;
Program. Once approved by the Parliament, the annual budget is released in quarterly (and&#13;
sometimes monthly) tranches based on the actual collection of revenues during the year. This&#13;
procedure is necessitated by the fact that the value of the Lithuanian Lita (LT), which was introduced&#13;
in June/July 1993, is controlled by a currency board arrangement under which Litas are only issued&#13;
against net inflows of hard currency. This system, which is excellent for exercising fiscal and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Highway Sub-Sector                                                                9&#13;
monetary discipline, nevertheless makes it difficult for LRA to plan and execute its annual program&#13;
since the actual resources available to it are subject to change.&#13;
2.21   Another characteristic of the Lithuanian highway maintenance program is related to the&#13;
weather conditions. The construction season during which bitumen products can be applied for&#13;
surface dressings and overlays is generally limited to the May through Septemnber period because of&#13;
the cold climate. Somewhat balancing the sunmmer workload, the winter season requires snow&#13;
clearing and salt spreading in order to keep the roads safe and open to traffic. However, this work is&#13;
irregular and difficult to plan because of the unpredictability of the snowfall and icing.&#13;
2.22   Budget Levels. As mentioned earlier, budgets have been substantially reduced from the&#13;
anounts made available prior to Independence. LRA's actual budget in constant prices for road&#13;
naintenance and construction since 1988, as calculated by LRA, has been as follows:&#13;
Table 2.4: LRA Annual Budjet&#13;
(million Litas) in 1993 prices&#13;
1988      1989      1990       1991       1992       1993      1994       199S&#13;
l  390    363        354        259       197        106.4       98       106&#13;
Thus inflation caused a reduction in LRA's 1994 budget when measured in constant prices to about 25&#13;
percent of the 1988 level. Some of this decrease was absorbed by a reduction in real average wages,&#13;
with the average monthly pay for LRA employees falling to the equivalent of about US$120 per&#13;
month. During 1995, wages for LRA's employees were increased substantially, to an average level&#13;
of about USS250 per month for professional staff, and the LRA budget was increased to 136 million&#13;
litas. As of January 1, 1996, a new schedule of road user charges went into effect that is expected to&#13;
provide 220 million litas for LRA's budget in 1996. This is equal to about 0.72 percent of GDP&#13;
compared to the 1.0 to 1.2 percent of GDP that is considered as a norm for road maintenance costs in&#13;
Western countries.&#13;
2.23   The periodic maintenance and rehabilitation accomplished with the LRA budget allocations in&#13;
the past have been as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                                                               The Highway Sub-Sector&#13;

2.24   Comparisons of past budget levels, work performed, and the need for future financing for&#13;
maintenance of the road network is made complicated by the difficulty in adjusting the exchange rates&#13;
on a realistic basis. Also, the relationship between the budgets and the work accomplished was&#13;
affected by other factors that must be kept in mind when making projections of future costs and&#13;
requirements. First, the real cost of equipment was minimal during the years right after Independence&#13;
since very little new equipment was purchased during this period. Second, bitumen, aggregate and&#13;
fuel were imported from Russia at subsidized prices prior to Independence, which makes comparisons&#13;
difficult. Third, the compression in wages during the post-Independence period reduced the average&#13;
cost of labor to a level that was not sustainable over the long run, and has since been substantially&#13;
adjusted as noted in para. 2.21.&#13;
E. Road User Charges&#13;
2.25   After Independence the Government established a Road Fund, financed by a tax on industry&#13;
revenues and a portion of the excise taxes on petrol, diesel fuel and lubricants. However, revenues to&#13;
the Fund went to the Ministry of Finance rather than to the road maintenance organizations, and the&#13;
Ministry then made some portion of the income to the Road Fund plus an allocation from general&#13;
Government revenues available to LRA and the larger municipalities as part of the annual budget&#13;
process. In 1995, a new Road Fund Law was passed, and subsequently amended on March 28, 1996,&#13;
that provides for increased tax rates effective as of January 1, 1996, with 80 percent of the funds to&#13;
be made available to LRA and the other 20 percent to the eleven largest municipalities, for road and&#13;
street maintenance. The income to the Road Fund now includes the industry tax as before, 15 percent&#13;
of the fuel and lubricant excise taxes, truck licensing taxes, and a transit tax on truck traffic and on&#13;
loads in excess of permissible limits. A provision also calls for the set-aside of 1 percent of the&#13;
Road Fund income, to be taken from the LRA share, for a special Road Traffic Safety Fund, to be&#13;
administered by the Ministry of Transport. Finally, the Law also provides that the industry revenue&#13;
tax will gradually be phased out over the next four years and will be replaced by an increasing share&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Highway Sub-Sector                                                               11&#13;
of the revenues from the fuel excise taxes (from the present 15 percent to 50 percent).&#13;
2.26   The net effect of the new Law is to provide an imnmediate increase in the funds available to&#13;
the LRA in 1996, from the 139 million Litas in 1995 to an estimated 220 million Litas in 1996, and a&#13;
comparable increase in the funds available to the Municipalities for street maintenance. Further, the&#13;
growth of the economy and the shift from the industry tax to a larger share of the fuel excise taxes is&#13;
expected to provide for a significant increase in the LRA and Municipal budgets each year for the&#13;
next five years. No exact estimates are available at this time, but the tentative estimates that have&#13;
been made are very encouraging as to the possible levels of income that will be available. Since the&#13;
existing law could be changed at any timne, an agreement was reached during negotiations that&#13;
provides for the possibility of suspension of disbursements in the event of a change that adversely&#13;
affects LRA's ability to fulfill its functions of maintaining the road network (see para. 6.1 (i)).&#13;
2.27   The new law represents important progress toward a rational and appropriate form of road&#13;
user charges. It eliminates the use of the general tax on corporate revenues, which have no direct&#13;
link to road use, with the principle dependence on fuel taxes, which are expected to account for over&#13;
half of the income to the Road Fund in the year 2000. The law could be improved, however, in a&#13;
number of respects. First, there is no registration tax on personnel vehicles, since a provision to this&#13;
effect was rejected by the Parliament, which could provide substantial additional income to the Fund.&#13;
Also, the penalty for overloads does not adequately reflect the exponentially increasing cost of&#13;
damage that these loads inflict on the pavements as the loads are increased. Also, while the present&#13;
law will generate substantially greater income than has been available to the road maintenance&#13;
organizations since Independence, no careful study has been made of the projected income from the&#13;
present tax provisions in the new law or the optimum amount of funds required for road maintenance,&#13;
including the amounts needed to reduce the considerable backlog of deferred maintenance that has&#13;
accumulated during the years of inadequate budgets (see paras. 4.8 and 4.15).&#13;
F. Design and Construcion&#13;
2.28   The design standards have been those used by the former Soviet Union, but after a recent&#13;
review by the LRA, Lithuanian standards based mainly on the German standards (DIN) have been&#13;
established. The geometric standards of the existing roads are generally adequate although some&#13;
roads have narrow carriageways that will need to be widened and strengthened when road traffic,&#13;
especially heavy vehicles, increases. Much of the main and basic road network has gravel shoulders,&#13;
which over time will need to be improved.&#13;
G. Environmental Procedur  and Issues&#13;
2.29   The central environmental authority in Lithuania is the Ministry of Environmental Protection.&#13;
The Ministry sets limits for use of natural resources, determines environmental standards and gives&#13;
permits for the discharge of pollutants. It also establishes the procedure for, organizes and&#13;
implements Environmental Impact Assessments, sets conditions for the approval of projects so that&#13;
they will conform with enviromnental requirements, and monitors environmental compliance.&#13;
Lithuania's environmental standards, which became effective in January 1992, establish limits for the&#13;
discharge of pollutants. These standards apply to the operation of all private and public enterprises&#13;
including the asphalt plants that serve the road construction and maintenance industry. At the time of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                                               The Highway Sub-Sector&#13;
Independence, most of LRA's asphalt plants were not equipped with efficient production and emission&#13;
control systems, and disposal of waste materials from road construction operations was not carefully&#13;
controlled. However, these operations are now expected to comply with the new rules and&#13;
regulations. On the positive side, LRA's periodic maintenance operations contribute positively to the&#13;
enviromnent since this work applies to already existing structures that do not generate new&#13;
environmental problems, while the maintenance works result in reduced fuel consumption and safer&#13;
roads.&#13;

The Bank's Experience and Strategy                                                   13&#13;
III. THE BANK'S EXPERIENCE AND STRATEGY&#13;
A. Bank Lending to Lithuania&#13;
3.1     The first Bank lending operation with Lithuania since it joined the World Bank in 1991 was&#13;
a Rehabilitation Loan for US$60 million equivalent to finance imports of materials, spare parts and&#13;
equipment, approved on October 22,1992 and recently completed. Loan processing and&#13;
implementation proceeded expeditiously, and the loan proceeds were fully utilized. In addition, the&#13;
Bank has approved a US$26.4 million Power Rehabilitation Loan, a US$7.0 million Klaipeda&#13;
Enviromnent Loan, a US$25 million Enterprise and Financial Sector Loan, a US$6.2 million Siauliai&#13;
Environmental Loan, a US$30 million Private Agriculture Development Loan, a US$5.9 million&#13;
Klaipeda Geothermal Demonstration Loan and a US$10.0 million Energy Efficiency/Housing Pilot&#13;
Project.&#13;
B. Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
3.2   The main objective of the Bank's strategy for Lithuania, as outlined in the Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy document dated November 1, 1994, is to support Lithuania's accelerated economic&#13;
transformation toward a market system and the recovery of output and export growth and living&#13;
standards through reforms in three key areas, including the policy and institutional environment for&#13;
private investment, strengthening of financial institutions, and reorientation of the social safety net,&#13;
public services, infrastructure and the energy sector. The Bank will support these efforts through its&#13;
lending, economic and sector work. It has assisted the Government in formulating and implementing&#13;
a sound public investment program that is consistent with this strategy through a Public Expenditure&#13;
Review. The Bank is also assisting with aid coordination, including the mobilization of cofinancing&#13;
for Bank-financed investment projects.&#13;
3.3    Assistance to maintain and upgrade Lithuania's infrastructure such as roads, airports,&#13;
telecommunications, and ports is a critical factor in the encouragement of increased local and foreign&#13;
private investment. While Lithuania's overall physical infrastructure is well developed, much of it is&#13;
in urgent need of modernization and repair. Since Independence, there has been a declining level of&#13;
resources for maintenance of the road network, with a consequent buildup of deferred maintenance.&#13;
Thus a high priority for the Government and the Bank is to channel additional external resources to&#13;
help meet the country's maintenance requirements while the country's revenue base is being&#13;
reestablished, in order to prevent the need for much more expensive reconstruction in the future.&#13;
C. Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Projects in the Highway Sector&#13;
3.4   The proposed project will be the Bank's first highway loan in Lithuania. However, the Bank&#13;
has had considerable experience in financing highway projects in other parts of the world, including&#13;
Eastern Europe, and specifically in the Russian Federation, Estonia and Armenia during the past two&#13;
years.&#13;
3.5    Much of the Bank's lending for highway operations in other parts of the world was for road&#13;
construction up to about 1980. However, the road building boom of the 1960's and 1970's created an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                                      The Bank's Experience and Strategy&#13;
infrastructure that began to deteriorate rapidly in the late 1970's. Road networks had expanded much&#13;
faster than the corresponding maintenance budgets and institutional capacity to maintain them. The&#13;
serious magnitude of the problem was demonstrated in a policy study undertaken by the World Bank&#13;
in 1987. The study determined that one quarter of the paved roads and one third of the unpaved&#13;
roads required reconstruction, and another 40 percent of the paved roads required strengthening. If&#13;
the countries did not improve the maintenance of their roads, the eventual cost could easily increase&#13;
by two or three times, with serious implications for the cost to road users.&#13;
3.6    Concerned with this growing backlog of road maintenance in borrowing countries, the Bank&#13;
adopted many of the recommendations of the study in its sector and investment work. These&#13;
included: (a) improvement in road planning and programming, including more reliable information&#13;
and management methods and the application of economic criteria, (b) strengthening and reforn of&#13;
institutional performance, particularly by contracting out more maintenance activities to the private&#13;
sector, (c) reallocation of resources to balance construction and maintenance with increased allocation&#13;
of expenditures to reduce the maintenance backlog, and (d) improving the financing of roads,&#13;
particularly by the adoption of rational road user charge systems. The situation in Lithuania parallels&#13;
this worldwide experience, with a well developed road network suffering from lack of maintenance,&#13;
and these lessons have been applied in the design of the Highway Project.&#13;
D. Highway Sector Strategy for Lithuania&#13;
3.7    The document entitled "National Program for Transport Development of the Republic of&#13;
Lithuania", issued by the Ministry of Transport in 1993, sets forth the Government's policies&#13;
regarding the transport sector. The principal emphasis of this document is on the need to integrate&#13;
the Lithuanian transport system into the European transport network on a flexible basis that is&#13;
responsive to the narket demands of an evolving economic system. Emphasis will also be placed on&#13;
ensuring equal rights for all entrepreneurs, creating conditions for reasonable competition, and&#13;
demonopolizing and privatizing the state-owned transport entities. For the highway sub-sector, the&#13;
policy statement also recognizes the necessity of allocating the major share of the available financial&#13;
resources to road maintenance during the next several years in view of the constrained economic&#13;
situation, and of improving engineering design and construction techniques. In actual practice, the&#13;
LRA has already made considerable progress in utilizing the emerging private sector construction&#13;
industry in its road maintenance program, and at present all surface dressing and reconstruction work&#13;
is carried out on the basis of competitive bidding. As described previously, the Government has&#13;
already established a Road Fund designed to provide the resources needed to finance highway&#13;
maintenance, although the proceeds from this fund do not flow automatically to the road maintenance&#13;
organizations.&#13;
3.8    The Government's policy for the transport sector and highway sub-sector contain many&#13;
elements that are consistent with the Bank's views as enumerated in the study referred to in para. 3.6.&#13;
The challenge for the Government now is to translate its policy statement into an action program that&#13;
provides an adequate level of resources for road maintenance in the short run, that establishes a&#13;
reliable self-financing basis for future road maintenance based on appropriate user charges, that&#13;
expands competitive bidding procedures in a way that leads to the development of a viable private&#13;
sector construction industry, and that introduces modern and cost-effective planning, design and&#13;
materials into sector operations.&#13;
&#13;

The Bank's Experience and Strategy                                                 15&#13;
3.9   The Bank's strategy for the highway sub-sector is to assist the Government in meeting this&#13;
challenge through a lending operation that would include support for expanded maintenance operations&#13;
for a limited period of time and introducing improvements in operational procedures and techniques.&#13;
This lending operation would also be combined with the resources of several other donors who would&#13;
join with the Bank in meeting these needs, which in turn would help to coordinate the various donor&#13;
activities in the sector. In the longer run, the Government is expected to be able to mobilize the&#13;
resources necessary to meet its recurrent maintenance requirements, and future Bank lending for road&#13;
transport would be directed to road strengthening and new construction.&#13;

16                                                                           The Project&#13;
IV. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
4.1   The overall objectives of the Highway Project are to assist the Government of Lithuania in&#13;
preserving its road network, and to improve the efficiency of Lithuania's road maintenance&#13;
operations. The specific objectives of the project are:&#13;
(i)    To expand the level, quality and efficiency of periodic maintenance for roads and&#13;
bridge repairs;&#13;
(ii)   To reduce vehicle operating costs and improve the environment in five towns by&#13;
completing bypasses, and to help preserve the urban infrastructure by financing an&#13;
expanded program of street improvements and maintenance for the cities of Vilnius&#13;
and Kaunas;&#13;
(iii)   To facilitate road financing by encouraging an improved system of road user&#13;
charges;&#13;
(iv)   To encourage and support the development of private road construction and&#13;
engineering industries; and&#13;
(v)   To improve road safety conditions in Lithuania.&#13;
4.2    These objectives would be carried out within the context of an expanding market economy&#13;
and within a policy framework designed to utilize Lithuania's strategic geographical position as a&#13;
transport corridor between several major production centers in neighboring countries. They are&#13;
consistent with the Bank's desire to support Lithuania's transition from a centrally planned economy&#13;
to one based on market choices and private sector operations by providing critical infrastructure to&#13;
meet the needs of the expanding private sector and through the development of the private&#13;
construction industry.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
4.3   The Highway Project would include a three year program of activities at a total cost of&#13;
US$45.0 million (net of duties and taxes) consisting of the following components:&#13;
(a)    Lithuanian Road Administration (US$26.5 mnillion)&#13;
(i)    Repaving of portions of the Regional Road Network including the&#13;
Vilnius-Klaipeda East-West Motorway, based on the results of detailed&#13;
pavement surveys, strength and crack failure investigations (US$12.0&#13;
million).&#13;
(ii)   Completion of partially constructed by-passes around five urban areas&#13;
(US$5.6 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                              17&#13;
(iii)   Bridge repairs for the main road network (US$3.0 million).&#13;
(iv)   A Road Safety Program consisting of technical support for the DERS&#13;
in the Ministry of Transport and for LRA, as well as financing for&#13;
civil works required to eliminate accident black spots and to improve&#13;
road markings, guard rails and other safety measures (US$5.0&#13;
million).&#13;
(iv)   Technical services to assist LRA in identifying the most economic&#13;
pavement design and maintenance strategies and in improving LRA's&#13;
management systems; assistance in procurement, supervision of&#13;
contracts and project accounting; training for private road construction&#13;
companies; a road network study; and a study of the existing Road&#13;
Fund Law, including a forecast of the optimum amount of financing&#13;
required for the most economic maintenance level for the national&#13;
road network and options for improving its provisions to provide for&#13;
self-sufficiency in meeting Lithuania's road maintenance&#13;
requirements (US$0.9 million).&#13;
(b)    Municipality of Vilnius (US$5.0).&#13;
(i)    Repaving and reconstruction of high priority streets and bridge&#13;
repairs.&#13;
(ii)    Technical support to assist the Municipality to handle procurement,&#13;
monitoring, project accounting and the supervision of the civil works&#13;
included in the project.&#13;
(c)    Municipality of Kaunas (US$5. 1 million).&#13;
(i)    Repaving and upgrading of streets needed to provide an inner-city by-&#13;
pass through the southeastern part of the city so as to relieve the&#13;
heavy flow of traffic through the city center.&#13;
(ii)    Technical support to assist the Municipality to handle procurement,&#13;
monitoring, project accounting and the supervision of the civil works&#13;
included in the project.&#13;
The project cost estimate also includes physical contingencies as well as price contingencies calculated&#13;
on the basis of estimated worldwide inflation for the foreign costs and estimated domestic inflation for&#13;
the local costs over the project period for a total of US$8.4 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18                                                                             The Project&#13;
C. Detailed Project Description&#13;
4.4    Repaving of portions of the Vilnius-Klaipeda East West Motorway and the Regional Road&#13;
Network would include an estimated 303 km of overlays or recycling in order to restore the&#13;
pavements to an acceptable level of roughness and strength, at a total estimated cost of US$12.0&#13;
million. Road sections to be repaired have been selected on the basis of a review of the entire&#13;
national road network, taking into account the importance of different classes of roads based on traffic&#13;
levels, as well as the periodic maintenance that has already been completed or is planned for 1996&#13;
from financing provided by the EBRD-supported project mentioned in para. 2.18 or from LRA's own&#13;
budget. Road condition surveys and economic evaluations were then carried out on the roads most&#13;
likely to need repairs, using the HDM-3 model to determine the pavement maintenance alternatives&#13;
and road sections that would produce the highest economic rates of return and Net Present Values&#13;
(NPVs). For each section of road, five different pavement maintenance alternatives were tested (see&#13;
Annex C). This evaluation was then used as a basis for selection of specific road sections for&#13;
inclusion in the project. Surveys will be repeated each year and the economic evaluations will be&#13;
recalculated to determine if the priorities have changed due to further road deterioration, which will&#13;
be used for the selection of the road sections for that year's work program. The detailed pavement&#13;
designs will be made based on a careful evaluation of the pavement conditions and the use of the most&#13;
economic pavement maintenance strategies that are available.&#13;
4.5    Completion of partially completed bv-passes will include the by-passes at Turzenai,&#13;
Vilkaviskis, Silute, Siauliai, and Daugai for an estimated total cost of US$5.6 million. These by-&#13;
passes, to be financed by EBRD, were selected after an economic evaluation that determined that each&#13;
had a satisfactory Economic kate of Retum and Net Present Value (NPV).&#13;
4.6    The Bridge component will include repair of about 10 bridges on the main road network that&#13;
are in critical need of maintenance, for an estimated cost of US$3.0 million. The economic rate of&#13;
return was calculated for after an economic evaluation of 20 bridges in need of repair that were&#13;
considered by LRA as of most importance to the road network, and those with the highest ERRs and&#13;
NPVs were selected for inclusion in the project. An expanded bridge inspection system is being&#13;
installed during project preparation with assistance from Norway and Denmark. The work will be&#13;
completed before project effectiveness.&#13;
4.7    A Road Safety program will include technical services to strengthen the road safety work of&#13;
the emerging road safety organizations, including (i) assisting DERS to develop a computerized&#13;
vehicle and drivers license register and road accident reporting and analyzing system to be integrated&#13;
with the corresponding systems operated by the police and customs, (ii) assisting DERS in developing&#13;
an accident location coding system for urban areas, (iii) assisting DERS and its counterpart&#13;
departments in other Ministries to develop plans for and initiate education for school children, traffic&#13;
safety information, driver training, review of legislation, and training of traffic police; (iv) assisting&#13;
LRA and the municipalities of Lithuania to develop traffic safety design standards for road and street&#13;
infrastructure including road signs and road markings; (v) providing training in the road safety aspects&#13;
of road and street planning, design, construction and maintenance works, and in executing road safety&#13;
audits, (vi) assisting LRA in analyzing accident black spots, and the subsequent prioritization and&#13;
design of traffic safety measures. It will also include a civil works component for works to eliminate&#13;
the most serious accident black spots, additional road markings, the improvement of road signs, and&#13;
the addition or improvement of guard rails. The Road Safety Program will have a total estimated cost&#13;
of US$5.0 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                           19&#13;
4.8   Technical Services to LRA will include an organizational review to find improved means for&#13;
coordinating the considerable knowledge and skills that are available in TRRI, Problemnatica, and&#13;
Kelprojektas in the task of analyzing the pavement problems, applying research results and economnic&#13;
analysis, and incorporating the conclusions into pavement design specifications and bidding documents&#13;
providing the most economic solutions for different road conditions. These services will also include&#13;
practical assistance in the application of the World Bank procurement procedures, and in establishing&#13;
appropriate contract supervision and quality control. Training will be provided to the construction&#13;
industry to familiarize the contractors with the World Bank bidding procedures, contract documents&#13;
and conditions, and to assist them in developing their skills and competitiveness as contractors. This&#13;
component will include a study of the country's road network to determine what kinds of roads should&#13;
be maintained by LRA and what other arrangements could be utilized for the maintenance of smaller&#13;
local roads, such as through the establishment of road user associations. Another study, financed by&#13;
the existing EBRD loan, is being carried out to determine possible improvements in the structure of&#13;
road user charges, as well as to determine what level of charges is required to optimize the&#13;
maintenance of the national road network (see para. 4.15). The total cost of this component, which is&#13;
described more fully in Annex J, is US$0.9 million.&#13;
4.9   The Municipality of Vilnius component will include the repaving of streets that are in urgent&#13;
need of attention as the result of several years of inadequate maintenance. The streets to be repaved&#13;
have been identified from a list established by visual inspection to be most in need of repair and then&#13;
selected through surveys and economic analysis carried out with the assistance of a foreign consultant.&#13;
This component will also include technical services to assist the Municipality to carry out the detailed&#13;
design, to issue tenders in accordance with World Bank procedures, and to assure the quality of the&#13;
work. All civil works will be carried out on a contract basis with the contractors selected on the&#13;
basis of competitive bidding.&#13;
4.10   The Municipality of Kaunas component will include the construction of a new link in the&#13;
street network that will facilitate the passage of vehicles over a route by-passing the city center, thus&#13;
relieving the flow of traffic through the most congested area of the city. The work will include the&#13;
construction of the approach roads to a new bridge that is under construction, which will generate&#13;
sizeable traffic benefits even before the completion of the bridge since these roads will coMect the&#13;
new road link to a main thoroughfare. The total estimated cost of this component is US$5.1 I million.&#13;
Technical assistance will be provided to assist the Municipal officials to carry out the work in&#13;
accordance with the requirements of the EBRD, which is providing financing for this component. All&#13;
civil works will be carried out on a contract basis with the contractors selected on the basis of&#13;
competitive bidding.&#13;
D. Cost Estimates and Financing&#13;
4.11   The estimated total cost of the project is US$45.0 million, net of taxes and duties, including&#13;
physical and price contingencies, with a foreign component of US$30.4 million, equivalent to 67.6&#13;
percent of project costs. Costs were estimated on the basis of December 1995 prices and include&#13;
physical contingencies of ten percent for materials, equipment and civil works, amounting to US$3.5&#13;
million. Price contingencies, amounting to US$4.9 million, are based on average forecasts of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20                                                                           The Project&#13;
inflation for foreign supplied components of 2.4 percent per annum and for local costs at the rate of&#13;
25 percent the first year, 15 percent the second year, and 10 percent the third year of the project.&#13;
The detailed estimated cost of the project is given in Annex B and is sumrnarized in Table 4.1.&#13;

The World Bank would finance US$ 19.0 million or 42 percent of total project costs, the EBRD&#13;
would finance US$ 14.1 million, EU-Phare would finance US$ 1.2 million equivalent, other donors&#13;
(Finland and Swedish, Norwegian and Netherlands Trust Funds) would finance US$ 0.7 million and&#13;
the Government of Lithuania would finance US$ 10.0 million and any duties and taxes that may apply&#13;
to the project. EU-Phare, Finland and the Trust Funds would provide financing for the Road Safety&#13;
Program, the technical services and training on a grant basis.&#13;
4.12   Loans from IBRD and EBRD would be made to the Government as represented by the&#13;
Ministry of Finance. The Ministry would pass on the funds to the beneficiaries (the IBRD proceeds&#13;
to the LRA and the Municipality of Vilnius, and the EBRD proceeds to the LRA and the Municipality&#13;
of Kaunas) through on-lending agreements at the same terms and conditions that the Government&#13;
receives from the IBRD and the EBRD. The IBRD would in turn enter into a Project Agreement&#13;
with the Municipality of Vilnius and the EBRD with the Municipality of Kaunas that specify the terms&#13;
and conditions that apply to each of them for their component of the project. The local contributions&#13;
for the project would be the responsibility of each Beneficiary, and could be taken from their share of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                            21&#13;
the Road Fund or from their general budgets. Assurances were received at negotiations that the&#13;
Govermnent and the Beneficiaries would make available the level of resources needed to finance their&#13;
respective shares of the project (see para. 6.1 (ii)). The Ministry of Finance has stated that projects&#13;
financed by International Agencies are now exempt from the VAT. In any event, if any taxes and&#13;
duties would apply, it would be the responsibility of the Beneficiaries to provide the financing. The&#13;
Beneficiaries would also be obliged by the Government to repay the Ministry of Finance either from&#13;
future Road Fund income or from their general budgets. Parliamentary approval is necessary after&#13;
the Loan and Project Agreements have been signed before the loan can be effective.&#13;
4.13   Financial Analysis. There is no adverse fiscal impact on the Ministry of Finance from either&#13;
the provision of counterpart funds for the project or from the repayments of the Bank loan, since both&#13;
of these will be the responsibility of the Benefiaries, as noted in para. 4.12. A review of the financial&#13;
impact on the Beneficiaries indicates that in the case of the LRA, its contribution to the project would&#13;
average the equivalent of US$2.8 million each year for three years, and interest and principal&#13;
repayments would increase to a level of US$3.1 million in the fourth year. In no year would the total&#13;
of the contributions and repayments exceed 8 percent of the LRA's 1996 budget, which should be&#13;
easily manageable, especially since the future budget levels are expected to increase by more than 10&#13;
percent per year as a result of the Road Fund Law passed this year (see paras. 2.25 and 2.26).&#13;
Furthermore, the resources to be made available by the LRA as counterpart funds are budget&#13;
resources that would have been used for the same purposes if the Loan did not exist (i.e. for periodic&#13;
road maintenance) and therefore LRA would not be required to forego financing of other activities in&#13;
order to participate in the project.&#13;
4.14   For the Municipalities of Vilrius and Kaunas, the situation is similar. The total of their&#13;
contributions to the project and the estimated interest charges and principal repayments would in no&#13;
case exceed 38 percent of their estimnated income from the Road Fund in 1996, and their provision of&#13;
counterpart funds would come from resources that would in any event be used for street maintenance&#13;
and rehabilitation. This percentage would be reduced in future years by the expected increases of the&#13;
Municipalities' income from the Road Fund, so that the amounts should be manageable for both&#13;
Municipalities.&#13;
4.15   Road User Charges Study. The study of the existing Road Fund Law, the future requirements&#13;
for road maintenance, and recommnendations for improvements of the existing schedule of charges is&#13;
being financed by EBRD. Assurances were received at negotiations that LRA will carry out a study&#13;
of (a) the required level of financing needed to maintain Lithuania's public road network; and (b) the&#13;
possible financing and collection mechanisms for road maintenance, in accordance with terms of&#13;
reference already agreed with EBRD (and acceptable to the Bank); will, by December 31, 1997,&#13;
review the results and recommendations of the study with the Bank, and by June 30, 1998, will&#13;
implement recommendations of the study agreed with the Bank and EBRD, including presentation to&#13;
Parliament of any amendments to the Road Fund Law (para. 6.1 (iii)).&#13;

E. Implementation&#13;
4.17  Project coordination would be the responsibility of LRA, which has appointed a Project&#13;
Coordinator, assisted by a small staff, to serve as the primary person responsible for assuring that the&#13;
LRA components are implemented efficiently and on schedule, and for coordinating the inputs of the&#13;
cofinancing partners and the other Beneficiaries through the operation of a Project Implementation&#13;
Unit (PIU) located in the LRA headquarters. The operating costs of the Project Coordinator and his&#13;
staff, including telephone calls, office supplies and project-related travel would be financed from&#13;
LRA's administrative budget. Assurances were received at negotiations that the Borrower will&#13;
maintain the PIU and shall operate it in accordance with implementation arrangements agreed between&#13;
the Borrower and the Bank (see para. 6.1 (iv)).&#13;
4.18  The Project Coordinator would be responsible for assuring that the Implementing Agencies&#13;
prepare annual work programs, financing plans and periodic reports of project progress. The annual&#13;
financing plans would include the level of financing needed for LRA and the Municipalities to&#13;
finance their shares of the project activities, and a projection of the sources of this financing. He&#13;
would arrange the training sessions for contractors, and arrange for audits of the project accounts.&#13;
He would also serve as liaison to the Ministry of Transport and Ministry of Finance for project&#13;
activities as well as to the Municipalities of Vilnius and Kaunas, and would be the central point of&#13;
contact for all of the donors supporting the project. He would be responsible for assuring that LRA&#13;
sets targets for the repaving program, and that LRA adheres to the IBRD procurement guidelines.&#13;
Assurances were received at negotiations that the Borrower will cause the Municipality of Vilnius and&#13;
LRA, by November 1 and 15 respectively, to prepare annual work programs and financing plans for&#13;
the next year and to review these plans with the Bank before implementing them (see para. 6.1 (v)).&#13;
4.19   The project implementation schedule and performance monitoring indicators are given in&#13;
Annexes D and E. The schedule is based on the civil works being carried out in the 1997, 1998 and&#13;
1999 construction seasons, with some disbursements carrying over into 2000, and the training and&#13;
technical assistance components extending into 1999.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                          23&#13;
4.20   LRA has stated that it intends to use economic analysis as a basis for all of its investments&#13;
during the life of the project, and would only undertake investments with a positive NPV. In order to&#13;
be able to review LRA's evaluation process in this regard, assurances were received at negotiations&#13;
that by November 15 of each year LRA would submit to the Bank the results of its economic&#13;
evaluations for its proposed road maintenance and rehabilitation programs for the following year and&#13;
for all of LRA's investment projects, based on the methodologies established in the Lithuanian&#13;
Investment Manual and LRA's Pavement and Bridge Management Systems (see para. 6.1 (vi)), and&#13;
that it will only undertake investments with a positive NPV based on a 10 percent opportunity cost of&#13;
capital, and with priority given to investments with the highest ratios of NPV to investment costs (see&#13;
para. 6.1 (vii)).&#13;
F. Status of Cofinancing&#13;
4.21 Cofunanciers identified for the project include the EBRD, EU-Phare and Finland, plus support&#13;
from the Swedish, Netherlands and Norwegian Trust Funds. The EBRD Board of Directors has&#13;
already approved its financing. The EU-Phare financing would not be formally approved until early&#13;
1997, but there is verbal agreement between EU-Phare and the Government that this component&#13;
would receive priority treatment in the 1997 budget for Lithuania. The cofinanciers will be invited to&#13;
participate in supervision missions during project implementation. Denmark is providing consultant&#13;
services arranged as part of the preparation of the Highway Project but is being utilized in 1996 in&#13;
support of the first EBRD project. The Danish assistance will terminate at the end of this year, but&#13;
will nevertheless be useful in preparing the LRA staff for implementation of the Highway Project.&#13;

4.23   Goods. The procurement of goods would be limited to purchase of road signs and small&#13;
items needed in support of the Road Safety Program, for a total estimated amount of US$ 200,000.&#13;
These items or groups of items estimated to cost US$200,000 or less per contract, up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$200,000, may be awarded under International Shopping.&#13;
4.24   Civil Works. There would be ten ICB contracts at an average of US$1,620,000 for an&#13;
accumulated estimate of US$16,200,000, with four for repaving on Regional Roads and East-West&#13;
Highway, two for bridge rehabilitation, two for black spot improvements and three for street&#13;
repaving. Other civil works contracts of less than US$500,000 per contract for overlay works, bridge&#13;
repairs, the improvement of accident black spots, and repaving of streets in the City of Vilnius would&#13;
follow the NCB procedure using the Sample Bidding Documents- Bidding Documents for&#13;
Procurement of Works-National Competitive Bidding (NCB) dated January 1995. Sections of roads&#13;
selected for overlays would be grouped into suitable contract packages. Each contract package would&#13;
be kept within one construction season. There would be around 21 NCB civil works contracts&#13;
financed jointly by IBRD and the Implementing Agencies, each contract valued at an average of&#13;
US$357,000 for an accumulated cost estimated at US$7.5 mnillion.&#13;
4.25   The introduction of competitive bidding procedures raises a number of issues that grow out of&#13;
the restructuring of force-account agencies and an infant industry. An anticipated area of difficulty is&#13;
the perceived inability for the newly established private firms to meet financial criteria. The&#13;
construction firms have their accounts audited for control purposes only, if at all. Their accounting&#13;
methodology does not always include western type depreciation of assets, and it might be difficult to&#13;
determine their credit-worthiness. The project would include training for the construction firms to&#13;
update their accounting systems and to facilitate international audits. The eligibility of the contractors&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                          25&#13;
would be subject to their meeting the criteria outlined under clause 1.8(c) of the January 1995 World&#13;
Bank Procurement Guidelines. As described in para. 2.11, the Government is in the process of&#13;
privatizing some of the District Offices. These companies, along with the road construction&#13;
companies that have already been privatized, are expected to become the principal local road&#13;
contractors since they possess the equipment and expertise to carry out the work.&#13;
4.26   Prior Review. Prior review would apply to all ICB contracts and to the first two NCB&#13;
contracts for works for each implementing Agency, and is expected to include about 80 percent of&#13;
the total value of IBRD financed contracts. This level of review should be adequate to assure good&#13;
quality preparation.&#13;
4.27   LRA will have had experience in implementing this type of project through its involvement&#13;
with the first EBRD project. However, a limited amount of technical support would still be required&#13;
and will be provided under the project through grant financing from Finland and Sweden in such&#13;
areas as preparation of World Bank Standard bidding documents and procurement, project&#13;
management and supervision. The Project Launch Workshop referred to in paragraph 4.33 will be&#13;
held in October 1996 to provide guidance for the preparation of bidding documents for the first&#13;
construction season. The General Procurement Notice will be issued following appraisal and will be&#13;
updated annually thereafter.&#13;
4.28   Procurement information will be collected by the PIU and reported to IBRD as follows:&#13;
(a)   prompt reporting of bidding, bid evaluation results and contract award infornation;&#13;
and&#13;
(b)   quarterly reports indicating: (i) project progress and problems; (ii) revised cost&#13;
estimates for individual contracts and the total project, including best estirnates for&#13;
physical and price contingencies; and (iii) revised schedules of procurement actions,&#13;
including advertising, bidding, contract award, and completion time for individual&#13;
contracts.&#13;
H. Disbursements&#13;
4.29   Disbursements are expected to be completed in four years. An estimated schedule of&#13;
disbursements is shown in Annex H. The expected closing date is December 31, 2000.&#13;
4.30 The expenditures for contracts for goods valued at less than US$200,000 and for works&#13;
valued at less than US$350,000 would be reimbursed on the basis of statements of expenditure (SOE)&#13;
procedures. The supporting documentation for these contracts would not be sent to IBRD, but would&#13;
be retained by the borrower for inspection by supervision missions and by external auditors. All&#13;
other disbursements would be fully documented. The minimum size of applications for direct&#13;
payment and for the issuance of Special Comnmitments would be 20 percent of the amnount of the&#13;
deposit to the Special Account.&#13;
4.31   To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower would establish Special Accounts in one of&#13;
the major commercial banks on terms and conditions satisfactory to IBRD to cover IBRD's share of&#13;
expenditures. The Authorized Allocation to the LRA Special Account would be US$1,300,000 and&#13;
the Municipality of Vilnius Special Account would be US$ 600,000, representing about one month of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26                                                                           The Project&#13;
average expenditures made through the Special Accounts during the construction season. No initial&#13;
lower levels have been specified for the Special Accounts since these are the minimum amounts that&#13;
will be needed in view of the concentration of disbursements that are expected to take place during&#13;
the relatively short construction season. Applications for replenishment of the Special Accounts&#13;
would be submitted monthly or when one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs&#13;
earlier. Documentation requirements for replenishment would follow the standard Bank procedure as&#13;
described in the Disbursement Handbook, Chapter 6. Monthly bank statements of the Special&#13;
Accounts, which have been reconciled by the Borrower, would accompany all replenishment&#13;
applications.&#13;
4.32   The proceeds of the IBRD loan would be disbursed on the following basis:&#13;

I. Reporfing, Accounting and Auditing&#13;
4.33   The accounting for all Special Account transactions and for all other project-related accounts&#13;
will be maintained in accordance with international accounting standards. Annual financial statements&#13;
of IBRD-financed components and for LRA's overall operations will be prepared in a format&#13;
acceptable to IBRD and audited in accordance with International Auditing Guidelines by suitably&#13;
qualified independent auditors acceptable to IBRD, and submitted to IBRD within six months of the&#13;
close of LRA's fuiancial year. Audits will also be carried out at the same time, and for&#13;
corresponding periods, in accordance with IBRI) guidelines, for SOEs against which disbursements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                          27&#13;
have been made or are due to be made out of the credit proceeds, and specific reference will be made&#13;
in the audit reports accompanying the financial statements.&#13;
4.34   Quarterly progress reports covering all project components will be prepared by LRA and sent&#13;
to IBRD within one month after the end of each quarter. These reports will include: (a) progress&#13;
achieved against agreed implementation and disbursement schedules, and key performance indicators,&#13;
including number of contracts awarded and length of roads rehabilitated, maintained; (b) work&#13;
programs and cost estimates for the coming quarter and for the total project; and (c) procurement&#13;
information as specified in para. 4.26 (b). The main purpose of the reports will be to provide LRA&#13;
timely and updated information on implementation of project components, highlighting issues and&#13;
problem areas, recommending actions and commenting on progress in resolving previous&#13;
recommendations. LRA will also prepare an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) in accordance&#13;
with IBRD guidelines and submit it to IBRD promptly after completion of the project but in any event&#13;
not later than six months after the credit closing date.&#13;
J. Project Supervision&#13;
4.35   Three Bank supervision visits to Lithuania each year, each staffed by a senior highway&#13;
engineer and such specialists as may be appropriate for each phase of the project (such as a&#13;
procurement expert or traffic safety specialist), would be required over the life of the project, each of&#13;
about one or two week duration. The total amount of supervision envisaged annually would be 18-24&#13;
staff weeks. A Project Launch Workshop would be held in October 1996 with instruction on Bank&#13;
Procurement Guidelines, disbursement procedures and reporting requirements. Subsequent missions&#13;
would review both physical progress and to what extent the project is achieving its stated objectives.&#13;
The Performance Monitoring Indicators shown in Annex E will be used to measure and report on&#13;
both of these aspects. Cofinanciers would be invited to participate in all supervision missions. A&#13;
schedule of supervision activities is included as Annex I. A mid-term review would be held not later&#13;
than November 1, 1998, to assess the effectiveness of the project arrangements, to review the&#13;
adequacy of road user charges, and for the reallocation of funds between project categories if&#13;
necessary. Assurances were received at negotiations to this effect ( pam. 6.1 (viii)).&#13;
K. Environmental Aspects&#13;
4.36   The periodic maintenance operations included in the project are not expected to generate any&#13;
significant environmental problems since work would be done on existing roadways, utilizing existing&#13;
quarries and asphalt plants. Since the environmental risks are limited, this project has been&#13;
designated as Category B, indicating that a full Environmental Assessment is not required. An&#13;
environmental review was carried out during project preparation and the results confirmed the above&#13;
assumptions. The review found that emissions from the asphalt plants that would be used in the&#13;
project are all within Lithuania's environmental standards. Environmental reviews had already been&#13;
carried out for the five By-Passes, and the minor mitigation measures recommended in those reports&#13;
have been included in the By-Pass designs. The consultant recommended that for road rehabilitation&#13;
of roads located in close proximity to watercourses, special care should be taken during construction&#13;
to avoid polluted run-off entering the water, which will be done. The project is expected to have&#13;
several positive environmental effects through reducing traffic congestion and pollution by comnpleting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28                                                                            The Project&#13;
selected city bypasses and the inner-city by-pass in Kaunas. The Executive Summary from the&#13;
consultant's report has been attached as Annex K.&#13;
L. Program Objective Categories&#13;
4.37   The project would contribute directly to the sustainable development of Lithuania by&#13;
preserving the road network, which is an important part of the country's essential infrastructure, and&#13;
by making Lithuania more competitive in world markets by reducing road transport costs. It would&#13;
also make a significant contribution to the development of the private sector in Lithuania through the&#13;
strengthening of the road construction industry.&#13;
M. Poverty Analysis&#13;
4.38   The introduction of private contracting for periodic maintenance would likely lead to higher&#13;
levels of income for the work force carrying out the work. At the same time, the project may lead to&#13;
lower levels of road maintenance employment overall than was the case before Independence as the&#13;
road maintenance operations become more efficient, but higher employment levels than in recent&#13;
years when the national budget was extremely restricted. The improved condition of the roads should&#13;
have a positive effect on the ability of rural people and small businesses to bring their products to&#13;
market, both by assuring access to markets and by reductions in transport costs. There will also be&#13;
an indirect impact on the poor by supporting improvements in the general economy through reduced&#13;
vehicle operating costs.&#13;
N. Participatory Approach&#13;
4.39   During project preparation, the World Bank preparation missions consulted extensively with&#13;
the managers and staff of LRA, TRRI, Problematica, contractors and the related Ministries in&#13;
discussions of the project methodology, the concepts of privatization and competitive bidding, and the&#13;
requirements of a market-based economic system. The project would continue the participatory&#13;
approach begun during preparation involving the important stakeholders in the road sector, the design&#13;
and research institutes, the Traffic Police and the various Ministries involved in the sector during&#13;
project implementation. The Government also consulted with road users, including the operators of&#13;
transport companies, when deciding gradually to phase out corporation revenue taxes while increasing&#13;
the excise tax on fuel as the principal source of income for the Road Fund (see para. 2.25).&#13;

Project Benefits, Risks and Sustainability                                              29&#13;
V. PROJECT BENEFITS, RISKS AND SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
5.1    The project would expand the capacity of LRA and the Municipality of Vilnius to carry out&#13;
periodic road maintenance of Lithuania's public road network during a three year period (1997-1999).&#13;
This would prolong the life of the highway system and reduce road maintenance costs by avoiding&#13;
costly rehabilitation and reconstruction. It would also improve road conditions, thus reducing vehicle&#13;
operating costs, which would in turn make Lithuania's productive sector more competitive. An&#13;
additional project benefit would be the experience that would be gained by the private construction&#13;
industry in carrying out road maintenance work on a competitive basis and at a higher technical&#13;
standard than in the past.&#13;
5.2    The bridge component would introduce proper repairs on Lithuania's bridges, where little&#13;
maintenance has been carried out since the bridges were constructed. The main benefit would be to&#13;
retain in full service bridges where vehicle weight restrictions already have been or soon will be&#13;
imposed, thereby avoiding the need to divert traffic to longer routes. The bridges selected for repair&#13;
represent a variety of common bridge types with problems that are typical for Lithuania. The in-&#13;
depth inspection, economic design of the repair, and the choice of construction materials will serve as&#13;
demonstration projects for future repairs on other bridges. Some of the bridges are already damaged&#13;
beyond economic repair, and the structures will be monitored to ensure safe traffic during their short&#13;
remaining service life. The By-Pass component would provide better transit around municipal areas,&#13;
thus reducing vehicle operating time as well as traffic congestion in the municipal areas.&#13;
5.3    The benefits of the Road Safety component will be to reduce the high accident rate in&#13;
Lithuania, with a saving in human lives, hospital costs, vehicle repair costs, and reduced productivity.&#13;
This will be achieved through the implementation of improved accident reporting systems, driver&#13;
safety education programs, improved cooperation between the various Goverinent agencies with&#13;
responsibilities for road safety, improved traffic signs and road markings, and through removal of&#13;
accident black spots. The activities have been selected to give the optimum short term benefits in the&#13;
form of reduced accidents at the same time as the long term activities are initiated at relatively low&#13;
cost. All technical services and the equipment provided to DERS will be financed from the EU-Phare&#13;
grant.&#13;
5.4    The Municipality of Kaunas component would provide an inner-city bypass of the city center,&#13;
thus reducing traffic congestion, and would also provide the approaches to a new bridge that is under&#13;
construction (although the benefits from this component have been calculated on the basis of the&#13;
inner-city bypass only since the financing for completion of the new bridge is not yet certain).&#13;
Economic benefits resulting from the Kaunas bypass were calculated to include time saving, reduction&#13;
in vehicle operating costs, reduction in accidents, and environmental benefits.&#13;
5.5    The Net Present Value and Internal Economic Rate of Return. Shadow pricing was not&#13;
considered necessary since the alternative opportunity allocations of labor in the existing slow growth&#13;
environment are not plentiful. Therefore, the current costs do not need to be adjusted to reflect&#13;
alternative opportunity costs. Road sections and bridges to be repaired were selected for inclusion in&#13;
the project from the possible alternatives by the methods described in para. 4.4 and Annex C. The&#13;
NPVs and ERRs for the various selected components are as follows:&#13;

5.6   Sensitivity Analysis. Sensitivity analyses were carried out based on alternative vehicle traffic&#13;
forecasts of high, medium and low projections of economic growth (or in some cases 4, 2 and 0&#13;
percent traffic growth) and on possible cost increases of 20 percent. The low traffic growth scenario&#13;
is not considered very likely given the recent encouraging growth of the Lithuania economy and the&#13;
perceived high rates of growth in vehicle traffic observed on some roads in the last two years. The&#13;
possibility of cost increases for civil works is, on the other hand, quite possible in view of the&#13;
continued increases in the cost of goods and services in Lithuania in recent years.&#13;
5.7   For the East-West Highway reRaving, if the cost of construction is increased by 20 percent,&#13;
the ERR is decreased from 66.0 percent to 55.8 percent. The rates of return were calculated on the&#13;
basis of a rate of traffic increase each year based on a projected medium rate of economic growth for&#13;
the economy; if the economy grows only at a low rate, with corresponding reduced traffic growth, the&#13;
rate of return on the East-West Highway repaving investment would be reduced from 66.0 percent to&#13;
60.1 percent. If both traffic increases at the low rate and the construction costs are increased by 20&#13;
percent, the ERR would be reduced from 66.0 percent to a still very acceptable 50.4 percent. NPVs&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Benefits, Risks and Sustainability                                            31&#13;
were calculated for the repaving component using an opportunity cost of capital of both 10 and 15&#13;
percent. The results on the basis of 15 percent were all positive but 31 percent lower than at 10&#13;
percent.&#13;
5.8   For the Regional Roads repaving, if construction costs are increased by 20 percent, the ERR&#13;
would be reduced from 38.2 percent to 30.2 percent, and if the traffic growth is only at the low rate,&#13;
the ERR would be reduced to 34.3 percent. If both the construction costs are increased 20 percent&#13;
and the traffic growth is at the low rate of increase, the ERR would be a still very acceptable 26.7&#13;
percent.&#13;
5.9   For the By-Passes, if the low growth scenario is used to make the economic evaluations, the&#13;
ERRs for each of the By-Passes would decrease by about 3.5 percent and the total NPV for this&#13;
component would decrease from US$6.1 million to US$3.9 million. If construction costs were&#13;
increased by 20 percent, the total NPV for the component would be reduced from US$6.1 million to&#13;
US$4.7 million. If both the traffic growth is reduced to the level of the low growth scenario and the&#13;
cost of construction is increased by 20 percent, the overall NPV for the component would be reduced&#13;
from US$6.1 million to US$2.5 million. In this last event, the NPVs for three of the by-passes&#13;
(Vilkaviskis, Siauliai and Daugai) would be reduced to the break-even point based on a 10 percent&#13;
opportunity cost of capital. Therefore, the costs and traffic projections for these by-passes will be&#13;
carefully reevaluated in the year when construction is to be carried out, and they will only be included&#13;
in the work program if there is a favorable forecast for achieving a positive NPV.&#13;
5.10   For the Municipality of Vilnius, the ERR and NPV were calculated on the basis of a traffic&#13;
growth rate of 2 percent per year. If the traffic growth rate were 0 instead, the NPV would be&#13;
reduced by about 20 percent, which would still be a very acceptable rate of return. For the&#13;
Municipality of Kaunas, the low traffic scenario would reduce the NPV of the investment by 12&#13;
percent, which would also be very acceptable. No sensitivity calculation was made for increased&#13;
construction costs, but the ERRs are sufficiently high that the results would still undoubtedly be&#13;
extremely favorable.&#13;
5.11  For the Bridge Repairs component, economic evaluation of 20 bridges considered most in&#13;
need of repairs was carried out. The 10 bridges with the highest ERRs and NPVs were selected for&#13;
inclusion in the project, for a total cost of US$ 7.8 million. The ERRs and NPVs were calculated on&#13;
the basis of a traffic growth rate of 2 percent per year. With a traffic growth of 0 percent, the ERR&#13;
would be reduced from 108 percent to 103 percent, and with an increase in construction costs of 20&#13;
percent, the ERR would be reduced from 108 percent to 101 percent, indicating that the component is&#13;
not very sensitive to changes in the assumptions on which the evaluation is based.&#13;
5.12   For the Road Safety component, an ERR was calculated from similar kinds of works carried&#13;
out in Finland, adjusted for costs and benefits at Lithuanian levels. The result, based on conservative&#13;
expectations considering that virtually no road safety improvements have been made in the past in&#13;
Lithuania, showed an ERR of 55.6 percent. An increase in construction costs of 20 percent would&#13;
decrease the ERR to 44.5 percent, and a change in the traffic projection would not affect the results&#13;
since this was not a variable in the calculation of benefits.&#13;
5.13  In summary, the economic returns on the proposed investments are generally extremely&#13;
favorable, and would not be much affected by possible moderate increases in construction costs or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32                                                    Project Benefits, Risks and Sustainability&#13;
decreases in traffic growth. In all likelihood, traffic growth would exceed the modest increases that&#13;
were used in the base calculations as the Lithuanian economy recovers from the unusually severe&#13;
recession that followed the breakup of the Soviet Union, producing even greater returns than forecast&#13;
above.&#13;
B. Project Risks&#13;
5.14   Project risks are considered moderate for the project because of the competence of the&#13;
implementing agencies and the fact that LRA has had recent experience with the implementation of a&#13;
foreign-financed project similar to the proposed Highway Project. The risks that appear to remain are&#13;
as follows:&#13;
Risk                                            Proposed Mitigation&#13;
Possible delays caused by the inexperience of   Technical support and training for the&#13;

procurement guidelines and competitive          project, which should substantially reduce this&#13;

and therefore financing should be assured.&#13;
Possible overload for LRA's staff, which is     LRA is considering means by which it can&#13;

included in the project.                        ceiling.&#13;
C. Project Sustainability&#13;
5.15   The Government has already enacted the legal basis for providing an expanding level of&#13;
resources for highway maintenance through the establishment of the Road Fund, with users fees that&#13;
will expand as the economy expands and the tax base increases, which would assure the sustainability&#13;
of periodic maintenance of the highway network. The efficiency improvements expected from the&#13;
technical inputs and training included in the project are likely to have a sustained impact on LRA's&#13;
future operations because LRA is a well-established, stable organization that can be expected to&#13;
absorb the improved systems into its pernanent operating procedures. Also, the development of the&#13;
private road construction industry is likely to have a lasting impact if LRA continues its present policy&#13;
of utilizing private companies for carrying out the periodic maintenance portion of its highway&#13;
maintenance program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Agreements &amp; Recomnmendations                                                        33&#13;
VI. AGREEMENTS &amp; RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
6.1    Agreements Reached During Negotiations. During negotiations, agreement was reached on&#13;
the following points:&#13;
(i)    The Bank will have a right to suspend disbursements in the event that&#13;
the Road Fund Law is repealed or amended so as to adversely affect the&#13;
ability of LRA to effectively fulfill its functions of maintaining the road&#13;
network (see para 2.26).&#13;
(ii)   The Borrower and the Beneficiaries will make available each year during the&#13;
life of the project the level of resources needed to finance their respective&#13;
shares of project activities (see para. 4.12).&#13;
(iii) In order to assist in assuring an adequate and appropriate source of financing&#13;
for the maintenance of the road network, LRA will carry out a study of: (a)&#13;
the required level of financing needed to maintain Lithuania's public road&#13;
network; and (b) the possible financing and collection mechanisms for road&#13;
maintenance, in accordance with terms of reference agreed with EBRD; by&#13;
December 31, 1997, LRA will review the results and reconmmendations of the&#13;
study with the Bank, and by June 30, 1998, will implement recommendations&#13;
of the study agreed with the Bank and EBRD including presentation to&#13;
Parliament of any amendments to the Road Fund law (see para. 4.15).&#13;
(iv)   LRA will maintain the Project Implementation Unit and will operate it in&#13;
accordance with the implementation arrangements agreed between LRA and&#13;
IBRD (see para. 4.17).&#13;
(v)    By November 1 and 15 of each year during execution of the project, the&#13;
Municipality of Vilnius and LRA, respectively, will prepare annual work&#13;
programs and financing plans for the next calendar year for the work to be&#13;
carried out under the project, and will reach agreement on these programs&#13;
with IBRD before implementing them. The annual financing plans will&#13;
include financing needed for LRA and the Municipality to finance their shares&#13;
of project activities, and a projection of the sources of this financing (see&#13;
para. 4.18).&#13;
(vi)   By November 15 of each year during the execution of the project, LRA will&#13;
report to the Bank the results of economic evaluations of its proposed road&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation programs for the following year, including&#13;
those not included in the project, and for all of LRA's investment projects,&#13;
based on the methodologies established in the Lithuanian Investment Manual&#13;
and LRA's Pavement and Bridge Management Systems (see para. 4.20).&#13;
(vii)  LRA will only undertake projects with a positive Net Present Value based on&#13;
an opportunity cost of capital of 10 percent, with priority given to investments&#13;
with the highest ratios of NPV to investment costs (see para. 4.20).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34                                                        Agremes &amp; Recommendations&#13;
(viii)  LRA and the Municipality of Vilnius will: (a) maintain policies and&#13;
procedures adequate to enable them to monitor and evaluate on an ongoing&#13;
basis, in accordance with indicators satisfactory to EBRD, the carrying out of&#13;
the project and the achievement of the objectives thereof; and (b) review with&#13;
IBRD, by November 1, 1998, the progress made in the implementation of the&#13;
project; and will take all necessary measures to execute the actions identified&#13;
and agreed upon between IBRD and the Sub-Borrowers during such review.&#13;
(see para. 4.35).&#13;
6.2    Other Conditions. Conditions of effectiveness will be limited to the standard conditions.&#13;
For the component to be implemented by the Municipality of Vilnius, a condition of disbursements&#13;
will be the execution of an on-lending agreement with the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
6.3   Recommendation. Subject to the above, the Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$ 19.0&#13;
million at the standard LIBOR-based variable interest rate for US dollar single currency loans with a&#13;
maturity of 17 years including 5 years of grace. The Borrower would be the Republic of Lithuania.&#13;

HIGHWAY PROJECT&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
NPV: Net Present Value&#13;
IRR: Internal Rate of Return&#13;
1.    BACKGROUND INFORMATION. The Highway Design and Maintenance Model (HDM&#13;
III) was used for most of the analysis. The HDM has been created by the World Bank and used all&#13;
over the world to perform economic analysis on road maintenance and design. This model requires&#13;
as inputs the condition of the road (roughness, cracking, potholing, ravelling, geometric parameters,&#13;
history of the pavement), the level of traffic and its estimated growth broken down into five&#13;
categories of vehicles, the cost of vehicle maintenance, the cost of passenger time and cargo holding,&#13;
the depreciation of vehicles, and five different maintenance strategies and their impact on road surface&#13;
distress. The model calculates the road deterioration and the evolution of the roughness, and&#13;
consequently estimates the vehicle operating costs under the various maintenance strategies. The&#13;
model determines the highest NPV and IRR by estimating the total economic costs and benefits for&#13;
society for each of these strategies.&#13;
2.    Rehabilitation of the East-West Highway. The model HDM III with Lithuania-adjusted&#13;
deterioration values was used to determine the stretches of the East-West Highway and the pavement&#13;
strategies with the highest NPV (at 10 and 15% discount rates) and IRR. The four maintenance&#13;
strategies considered were remixing, a 10 cm overlay, a replacement of the asphalt concrete and a 5&#13;
cm overlay reinforced by steel wire nets (see Annex C- page 3/4 for the results of this analysis).&#13;
3.    Repaving of Regional Roads. The model HDM III was used to compare the following&#13;
maintenance strategies: no action; patching 100% of potholes; 12 mm single surface treatment; 4 cm&#13;
asphalt overlay at ICI 6+ patching; and 8cm overlay at ICI 4 + patching. The highest NPV and IRR&#13;
were used to prioritize the sections and maintenance strategies to be included (see Annex C- page 5/6&#13;
for the results of this analysis).&#13;
4.    Vilnius City. Thirty two streets were selected based on engineering judgement and the age of&#13;
the existing layers. The HDM III model was used to carry out an economic analysis based on two&#13;
discount rates (10 and 15 %), three levels of traffic growth (0, 2 and 4 %) and two different periods&#13;
(12 and 18 years). The cost benefit analysis led to a prioritization excluding sections with a rate of&#13;
return inferior to 37% (see Annex C- page 7/8 for the results of this analysis).&#13;
5.    Bridges. Twenty bridges were selected among the 50 considered in critical conditions, for&#13;
further investigations. The remaining life span and the decrease in bearing capacity of these bridges&#13;
have been assessed through a survey. The do-nothing alternative for a bridge consists in doing no&#13;
repair until its bearing capacity reaches a level which requires traffic diversion. The likely diversions&#13;
and repair required on each bridge were identified. The benefits are derived from the savings in&#13;
vehicle operating cost achieved when the diversion is avoided. A sensitivity analysis on traffic&#13;
growth (0, 2 and 4%) and cost of construction (80, 100 and 120%) was performed. The Bridges with&#13;
the highest NPV and IRR were selected to be financed under the project(see Annex C- page 9 for the&#13;
results of this analysis).&#13;
6.    Kaunas City. The cost benefit analysis was based on the comparison between the present&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

situation and the situation if the improvements are implemented. This comparison includes the&#13;
potential savings in accidents, time consumption, vehicle operating costs and pollution. The project&#13;
was estimated to lower annually the number of accidents by 13, the time spent in traffic by 0.7&#13;
million hours, the Vehicle Operating Cost by 6 MLTL, and pollution by 6 tonnes (10%). The unit&#13;
cost were estimated at 20,00OLTL/accident, 1.45 LTLlhour and 10,000LTL/tonnes of pollution and&#13;
the NPV and ERR were calculated on a 15 year period with a discount rate of 15 %. Various traffic&#13;
schemes were assessed during the preparation of the project and the one with the best NPV was&#13;
selected. A sensitivity analysis was carried out with the following parameters: Traffic Volumes,&#13;
Speed, Accident Rates, and Construction Costs.&#13;
7.    Bypasses. Due to a lack of funding in recent years, the construction of the five bypasses was&#13;
stopped, leaving uncompleted structures around the cities. The benefits achieved through the&#13;
construction of these bypasses comes from time savings, from vehicle operating costs and from&#13;
accident reduction. Environmental benefits were not assessed in monetary terms. Investment and&#13;
maintenance cost were included in the cost of the project. The evaluation criteria used for the project&#13;
were the IRR and the NPV (for discount rates of 10 and 15 %).&#13;
8.    Road Safety. The benefits achieved through the road safety component are assessed in five&#13;
steps:&#13;
(i) compare the accident data for an accident black spot to the data obtained for a similar road&#13;
segment (ie crossing, exit lane, etc...);&#13;
(i) estimate the future accident rate by considering traffic growth and other parameters.&#13;
(iii) predict the rate of accident to be achieved.&#13;
(iv) decide the specific activities necessary to remedy to the black spot and determine the impact of&#13;
each activity from a table based on past experience. (ex. 0,7 = 30% reduction of accidents).&#13;
(v) determine the cost optimal activity.&#13;
The value of one life has been estimated at a conservative 120,000 USD. The cost of injury has been&#13;
assessed at 12,000 USD per injured person. The NPV was calculated at both 10 and 15 %.&#13;

Environmental Review&#13;
This report is an environmental assessment of the Lithuanian Highway Project, financed by the World&#13;
Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The project has seven components as&#13;
follows:&#13;
i.    Repaving of highways and regional roads&#13;
ii.    Completion of 5 bypasses&#13;
iii.   Bridge repairs&#13;
iv.    Road safety program&#13;
v.    Technical services&#13;
vi.    City of Vilnius&#13;
vii.   City of Kaunas&#13;
Construction work on the bypasses and part of the City of Kaunas component has started, while the&#13;
extent of rehabilitation work on roads and bridges has not yet been decided.&#13;
The Transport and Road Research Institute in Kaunas have already completed Environmental Impact&#13;
Assessments for the bypasses. A summary of these reports is included here.&#13;
It is not believed that the rehabilitation of the highways and regional roads will have significant&#13;
impacts on the environment. However, care must be taken to protect natural watercourses during&#13;
construction works.&#13;
It is not believed that the bridge component will have significant impacts on the environment, but it&#13;
is important to protect nearby watercourses from pollution during the rehabilitation works.&#13;
The road safety program includes technical services and minor civil works that will not have any&#13;
negative environment effects, and will have positive effects if it successfully reduces the number of&#13;
accidents.&#13;
The City of Vilnius component involves rehabilitation of streets in Vilnius. No significant&#13;
environmental impacts are expected to arise from this component.&#13;
The City of Kaunas component, in addition to rehabilitation of some roads, include the construction&#13;
of a new section of road along the river. The new road layout will result in less emissions from&#13;
vehicle exhaust and less noise in populated areas. One building will have to be demolished, and an&#13;
alley of trees will have to be cut down. One of the most positive features of this project is the&#13;
construction of a bicycle lane along the river Nemunas.&#13;
It is not believed that any of the project components will have significant negative effects, and based&#13;
on environmental considerations, there are no reasons to abandon any part of the project.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The overall objectives of the Highway
            Project are to assist the Government of Lithuania in
            preserving its road network, and to improve the efficiency
            of Lithuania's road maintenance operations. The
            specific objectives of the project are: a) to expand the
            level quality and efficiency of periodic maintenance for
            roads and bridge repairs; b) to reduce vehicle operating
            costs and improve the environment by completing bypasses,
            and to help preserve the urban infrastructure by financing
            an expanded program of street improvements and maintenance
            for the cities of Vilnius and Kaunas; c) to facilitate road
            financing by encouraging road user charge system; d) to
            encourage and support the development of private road
            construction and engineering industries; and e) to improve
            road safety. The components are in three areas. The
            Lithuanian Road Administration includes: a) repaving of
            portions of the Regional Road Network; b) completion of
            partially constructed by-passes; c) bridge repairs; d) a
            road safety program; and e) technical services. In the
            municipality of Vilnius the components are the repaving and
            reconstruction of high priority streets and bridge repairs
            as well as technical support. In the municipality of Kaunas
            the components are the repaving and upgrading of streets and
            technical support.
