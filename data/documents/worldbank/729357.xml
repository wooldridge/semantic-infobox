            Regulating quality - let competing firms
            offer a mix of price and quality options
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In many developing countries, the
            regulation of infrastructure service standards is rigid, and
            makes services too expensive for the poor. The current wave
            of liberalization of infrastructure, is an opportunity to
            address this problem. Debate on expanding access under such
            reform, has so far centered on price, not quality. This note
            proposes a new regulatory framework, where large, and small
            providers compete to supply a range of services at prices
            that better reflect consumer willingness to pay.
