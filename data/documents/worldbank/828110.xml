Turkey has made an ad hoc and piecemeal use of protective and&#13;
incentive measures.   Sufficient attention has  not been given to the&#13;
interdependence of these various instruments and to their net effect on&#13;
different market destinations and sectors.&#13;
By  estimating  and  evaluating  the  quantitative  indicators  of&#13;
incentives and comparative advantage, this study attempts to quantify&#13;
the incidence of the system of protection and incentives in Turkish&#13;
manufacturing in 1981.   The findings are as follows:   (a) Both nominal&#13;
and effective protection are high and differ substantially among&#13;
sectors, between public and private firms, and between domestic and&#13;
export markets.   (b) Tariff redundancy exists in a number of sectors.&#13;
(c) There is a substantial bias against the private sector, due to a&#13;
lower input protection in the public sector and to the substantial&#13;
interest subsidy granted to public firms.   (d) There is a heavy bias&#13;
against exports in spite of generous export subsidies.  (e) The domestic&#13;
resource cost in a large number of sectors is high and differs&#13;
substantially  among  sectors.       (f)  The  domestic  resource  cost  is&#13;
substantially  higher  in  the  public  sector,   indicating  a  higher&#13;
inefficiency in that sector.   (g) Social profitability, on average, is&#13;
higher in the private sector. Mi) Wide differences exist between social&#13;
and private profitability among sectors and between public and private&#13;
firms, indicating the presence of price distortions both in the product&#13;
and factor markets.&#13;
To  rationalize   resource  allocation  in  Turkey,  the  wide&#13;
variations in protection and subsidies among manufacturing sectors,&#13;
between public and private firms, and between domestic and export&#13;
markets  need  to  be  gradually  narrowed.    This  requires  substantial&#13;
restructuring not only in import protection but also in the whole&#13;
incentive system.  The needed measures include:   (1) the elimination of&#13;
quantitative restrictions; (2) a reduction in the average tariff rate&#13;
and a narrowing of the variation around it; (3) the elimination of&#13;
preferential credit to the state economic enterprises; (4) a granting of&#13;
duty-free access to all imported inputs for export production; and (5)&#13;
the continuation of a realistic exchange rate policy with a gradual&#13;
elimination of export subsidies following the reduction in import&#13;
protection.&#13;
The policy measures introduced in December 1983 and January&#13;
1984 are steps  in the right direction.   However,  the new tariff and&#13;
export rebate rates were set in an ad hoc manner without an analytical&#13;
back-up to work out their impact on effective rates.&#13;

EXTRACTO&#13;
Turquia ha venido usando las medidas de protecci6n y los incentivos de&#13;
producci6n en forma'ad hoc y fragmentaria. No se ha prestado suficiente&#13;
atenci6n a la interdependencia de estos diversos instrumentos y a su efecto neto&#13;
en los diferentes destinatarios y sectores del mercado.&#13;
En el presente estudio se procura cuantificar la incidencia del sistema de&#13;
protecci6n e incentivos en el sector industrial turco en 1981 mediante la&#13;
estimaci6n y evaluaci6n de los indicadores cuantitativos de los incentivos y de&#13;
la ventaja comparativa del pais. Las conclusiones son las siguientes: a) la&#13;
protecci6n, tanto nominal como efectiva, es elevada y difiere notablemente entre&#13;
los distintos sectores, entre las empresas publicas y las privadas y entre el&#13;
mercado interno y el de exportaci6n; b) existe redundancia arancelaria en varios&#13;
sectores; c) hay un fuerte sesgo contra el sector privado, debido a la menor&#13;
proteccion de los insumos en el sector publico y a los elevados subsidios a los&#13;
intereses sobre los prestamos que se conceden a las empresas estatales;&#13;
d) existe un importante sesgo contra las exportaciones, a pesar de los generosos&#13;
subsidios a la exportaci6n; e) el costo de los recursos internos es elevado en&#13;
numerosos sectores y difiere considerablemente de un sector a otro; f) el costo&#13;
de los recursos internos es mucho mas alto en el sector publico, lo que indica&#13;
la mayor ineficiencia existente en ese sector; g) la rentabilidad social media&#13;
es mas elevada en el sector privado; i) la rentabilidad social y la privada&#13;
difieren ampliamente entre los sectores y entre las empresas pdblicas y las&#13;
privadas, lo que indica la existencia de distorsiones de precios tanto en el&#13;
mercado de productos como en el de factores.&#13;
Para racionalizar la asignaci6n de los recursos en Turquia sera necesario&#13;
reducir gradualmente las grandes diferencias en materia de protecci6n y&#13;
subsidios entre los subsectores industriales, entre las empresas puiblicas y las&#13;
privadas y entre los mercados interno y de exportaci6n. Para ello se requerirA&#13;
una considerable reestructuraci6n, no s6lo del sistema de protecci6n frente a&#13;
las importaciones, sino tambien de todo el sistema de incentivos. Entre las&#13;
medidas necesarias cabe citar las siguientes: 1) la eliminaci6n de&#13;
restricciones cuantitativas; 2) la reducci6n del arancel medio y de las&#13;
variaciones en torno al mismo; 3) la eliminaci6n de las preferencias otorgadas a&#13;
las empresas econ6micas estatales en materia de cr6dito; 4) la concesi6n de&#13;
acceso exento de impuestos a todos los insumos importados para la producci6n de&#13;
articulos de exportaci6n, y 5) la continuaci6n de una politica cambiaria&#13;
realista, con la paulatina eliminaci6n de los subsidios a la exportaci6n despues&#13;
de que se reduzca la protecci6n frente a las importaciones.&#13;
Las medidas adoptadas en diciembre de 1983 y enero de 1984 son un avance&#13;
por el buen camino. Sin embargo, los nuevos aranceles y las tasas de&#13;
desgravaci6n de las exportaciones se han fijado de una manera ad hoc, sin estar&#13;
respaldadas por un analisis de sus repercusiones en las tasas efectivas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
La Turquie a un systeme de protection et d'incitations fait de&#13;
mesures circonstancielles et fragmentaires. L'interdependance des divers&#13;
instruments qul le composent et leur efi-et net sur les differents marches&#13;
destinataires et les differents secteurs n'ont pas requ une attention&#13;
suffisante.&#13;
Les auteurs de cette etude s'efforcent, en estimant et en eva-&#13;
luant les indicateurs quantitatifs des nnesures d'incitations et des avan-&#13;
tages comparatifs, de chiffrer l'incidence du systeme sur le secteur manu-&#13;
facturier turc en 1981. Leurs conclusions sont les suivantes : a) La&#13;
protection, tant nominale qu'effective, est elevee mais varie sensiblement&#13;
selon les secteurs, selon qu'il s'agit d'entreprises publiques ou d'entre-&#13;
prises privees et selon que la production est destinee au marche int6rieur&#13;
ou a 1'exportation. b) Le tarif comprend des droits qui font double&#13;
emploi dans un certain nombre de secteurs. c) Le secteur prive est nette-&#13;
ment defavorise, le secteur public beneficiant de droits reduits sur les&#13;
importations d'intrants et de bonifications d'int6rets importantes. d) La&#13;
production pour l'exportation est tres defavorisee, malgre l'existence de&#13;
subventions genereuses. e) Le cofit en ressources interieures est nette-&#13;
ment plus eleve dans le secteur public, ce qui prouve que celui-ci est&#13;
moins efficace. g) La rentabilite sociale est, en moyenne, plus elev6e&#13;
dans le secteur prive. h) I1 existe des differences considerables entre&#13;
rentabilite sociale et rentabilite financiere selon les secteurs et entre&#13;
les entreprises publiques et privees, ce qui indique 1'existence de dis-&#13;
torsions des prix sur les marches des produits et des facteurs.&#13;
Pour rationaliser la repartition des ressources, il faut reduire&#13;
progressivement les differences consid6rables de protection et d'aide sous&#13;
forme de subventions entre les divers secteurs manufacturiers, les entre-&#13;
prises publiques et privees et les march]s int6rieurs et d'exportation.&#13;
Cela exige une reorganisation substantielle non seulement de la protection&#13;
contre les importations mais egalement de l'ensemble du systeme d'incita-&#13;
tions. Parmi les mesures necessaires, citons : 1) l1'limination des res-&#13;
trictions quantitatives; 2) une reduction du taux de droit moyen et un&#13;
retrecissement des ecarts par rapport a celui-ci; 3) la suppression du&#13;
credit pr6ferentiel accorde aux entreprises d'Etat; 4) l'admission en&#13;
franchise de tous les intrants importes pour la production de biens&#13;
d'exportation; et 5) la poursuite d'une politique de change realiste et&#13;
l1'limination progressive des subventions aux exportations lorsque la&#13;
protection contre les importations aura diminue.&#13;
Les mesures adoptees par les pouvoirs publics en decembre 1983&#13;
et janvier 1984 constituent autant de pas dans la bonne voie. Toutefois,&#13;
les d6cisions concernant le nouveau tarif et les ristournes au profit des&#13;
exportateurs ont ete prises de facon ponctuelle sans qu'il ait ete proced6&#13;
a une analyse permettant d'en determiner les effets sur les taux effectifs.&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
The  growth   of  Turkey's  manufacturing   output  has  been&#13;
impressive, averaging 10 percent in the First Perspective Plan period&#13;
(1963-77).   This can be ascribed mainly  to the generous  industrial&#13;
incentive system created in 1963 and continuously enhanced thereafter.&#13;
This system includes tax allowances, interest subsidies, export tax&#13;
rebates, duty-free importation, tariffs, quantitative restrictions,&#13;
export earnings retention as well as foreign exchange and credit&#13;
priorities. These incentives, combined with the rapid expansion in&#13;
domestic demand, increased profitability in the domestic market relative&#13;
to the export market and created a resource-pull effect in basic import-&#13;
substituting industries, particularly petroleum refining, transport&#13;
equipment and vehicles, fertilizers, machinery, and basic metals, with&#13;
public sector playing an important role.&#13;
All these favorable developments should be judged, however,&#13;
against the costs, namely the sub-optimal, high-cost, and inefficient&#13;
firms created during the industrialization process and the protracted&#13;
stagnation in employment and exports. These adverse developments could&#13;
be attributable mainly to the fact that the industrial incentives&#13;
provided very high, indefinite and indiscriminate import protection and&#13;
created a heavy bias against employment and exports.&#13;
The belated adjustment to the oil price increases and the&#13;
consequent heavy short-term borrowing combined with the adverse effects&#13;
of the incentive system created a deep and protracted balance of&#13;
payments crisis in 1977.  Due to the shortage of imported intermediates&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the growth rate of manufacturing output declined rapidly, becoming&#13;
negative after 1977.&#13;
In the early 1980, a far-reaching stabilization program was&#13;
introduced  and  the  incentive  system  was  partially  modified.    The&#13;
manufacturing industry responded favorably to the partial reversal of&#13;
industrial  policies.   The rate of growth of manufacturing output has&#13;
increased to 8.1 percent in 1981 and 6.0 percent in 1982; manufactured&#13;
exports grew at 131.7 percent in 1981 and 55.0 percent in 1982.&#13;
All  these  bring  the  industrial  incentives  into  focus.    A&#13;
careful evaluation of the system of industrial incentives seems to be a&#13;
precondition to redressing industrial policies so as to attain growth&#13;
and stability in the Turkish economy.   It is the purpose of this study&#13;
to  provide  such  an  evaluation.    By  estimating  and  evaluating  the&#13;
quantitative indicators of incentives and comparative advantage, this&#13;
study attempts to quantify the incidence of the system of protection and&#13;
incentives in Turkish manufacturing in 1981.&#13;
The  effects  of  industrial  incentives  are  reflected  in  the&#13;
following  two  sets  of  indicators:    (a)  indicators  of  incentives:&#13;
nominal protection coefficient (NPC), effective protection coefficient&#13;
(EPC) and effective subsidy coefficient (ESC); and (b) indicators of&#13;
comparative  advantage:       domestic  resource  cost (DRC)  and  social&#13;
profitability coefficient (SPC). 1/  These coefficients were estimated&#13;
by using data obtained from a sample survey of 123 public and private&#13;
1/  For their  description, interpretation, and estimation, see Balassa&#13;
(1977, 1982).&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
firms in 66 manufacturing  sub-sectors.   The results are presented at&#13;
four  levels  of  aggregation:    (i)  firms;  (ii)  66  sectors;  (iii)  14&#13;
sectors; and (iv) total manufacturing.&#13;
To compare the differential incidence, the results are also&#13;
broken down by ownership (public and private) and by market destination&#13;
(domestic and export).&#13;
The study was initiated under the Structural Adjustment Loan I&#13;

CHAPTER I&#13;
AN OVERVIEW OF THE TURKISH MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
The manufacturing industry in Turkey has been considered the&#13;
main   instrument  of  rapid   growth,   structural   change  and   self-&#13;
sufficiency. As such it has usually been the most favored sector of the&#13;
economy.   Resources have been channelled into it through heavy public&#13;
sector investment, particularly in import-substituting basic industries,&#13;
and through generous financial incentives coupled with a high level of&#13;
protection for private investment.&#13;
Replacing imports of non-durable consumer goods and their&#13;
inputs with domestic production did not encounter much difficulty and&#13;
the first stage of import substitution was completed with success by the&#13;
early 1960s. The second stage which involves the replacement of imports&#13;
of intermediate inputs and producer and consumer durables, followed and&#13;
was intensified in the 1970s.  Compared with the products of the first&#13;
stage, these products are more capital-, skill-, and import-intensive.&#13;
A successful second stage of import substitition, therefore, depends on&#13;
the availability  of capital,  skills,  and imports.   But the policies&#13;
pursued in the 1970s were not conducive to generating them.&#13;
Moreover, the high level of import protection combined with an&#13;
overvalued exchange rate created an anti-export bias, and export&#13;
disincentive resulting in stagnating export revenues in the 1960s and&#13;
1970s.   Rising import requirements had to be financed increasingly by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
external resources and workers' remittances, the latter equalled to 93&#13;
percent of total merchandised exports in 1974.&#13;
With a constantly rising incremental capital-output ratio,&#13;
increasing  volumes  of  external  resources  were  needed  to  supplement&#13;
insufficient domestic savings.&#13;
Adjustment to the oil price increases and to the world&#13;
depression   that   followed,   was   considerably   delayed.         Despite&#13;
insufficient voluntary savings and stagnating exports, the pace of&#13;
industrialization was maintained after 1973. But the consequent deficit&#13;
financing accelerated inflation. Short term external borrowing mounted,&#13;
and by 1978, external borrowing possibilities were exhausted.   Imports&#13;
declined and production and investment came to a standstill by the end&#13;
of 1979.&#13;
Since 1980 a series of policly reforms have been introduced to&#13;
stabilize the economy. These reforms include:&#13;
(a)  An  initial  large  devaluation  in 1980 followed by&#13;
daily adjustment of the exchange rate.&#13;
(b)  Higher  export  incentives:        subsidized  credit,&#13;
priority and duty-free access to imported inputs for&#13;
export  production,  tax  rebates,  elimination  of&#13;
licensing and relaxation of price controls in&#13;
exports  and  simplification  of  regulations  and&#13;
centralization of administration.&#13;
(c)  Partial  import liberalization:   elimination of the&#13;
quota list, shifting some imports to the more&#13;
liberalized   list   and   reduction   in   guarantee&#13;
deposits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
(d) Tax reforms to mobilize domestic resources and&#13;
restructure investment allowances.&#13;
(e)  Reorganization of the capital market:  deregulation&#13;
of interest rates and legislation for strengthening&#13;
the capital market.&#13;
(f)  Relaxation of direct controls:   decontrolling the&#13;
selling prices of most state economic enterprises&#13;
(SEE)   and   simplification   of   regulations   and&#13;
procedures.&#13;
The economy as a whole, and the manufacturing industry in&#13;
particular,  responded favorably to the policy reforms.   Inflation fell&#13;
from 100 percent in 1980 to 30 percent in 1982.  The growth rate of GNP&#13;
and  manufacturing  value  added  became  positive  after  1980.    Export&#13;
performance  of manufacturing  industry  has been  impressive.   In real&#13;
terins manufactured exports increased by 131.7 percent and 55.0 percent&#13;
in  1981  and  1982,  respectively.    International  confidence  has  been&#13;
restored.&#13;
These favorable results, however, have been accompanied by&#13;
rising unemployment, falling real wages, and declining investment.&#13;
This chapter provides an overview of the manufacturing industry&#13;
in Turkey in the last two decades. Section 2 presents the basic data on&#13;
Turkey's  manufacturing  sector  in  the  1960s  and  1970s.    Section  3&#13;
discusses  the  sources  of  growth.   Finally,  Section  4 takes  up  the&#13;
principal achievements and problems of Turkey's manufacturing sector.&#13;

2.       TURKISH MANUFACTURING IN FIGIJRES&#13;
This section draws together the readily available data to&#13;
provide an overall view of the sector.&#13;
Basic Indicators&#13;
Table 1.1 summarizes the basic indicators.   The growth rate of&#13;
value added was substantial in 1963-77: 10.0 percent on average. With&#13;
the emergence of the balance of payments crisis at the end of 1977,&#13;
however,  it declined sharply and became negative in 1980.   Production&#13;
responded favorably to the policy reforms introduced since 1980 and&#13;
growth again became positive in 1981 and 1982 (8.1 percent and 6.0&#13;
percent, respectively).&#13;
The share of manufacturing value added in GNP increased from an&#13;
average of 12.4 percent in 1963-65 to an average of 16.7 percent in&#13;
1981-82.   This rapid growth  is due basically to the creation of new&#13;
capacity in the manufacturing industry.   Indeed, the rate of growth of&#13;
manufacturing investment has been 11.6 percent on average until 1977,&#13;
and its share in total investment increased from 20.1 percent in 1963-65&#13;
to  31.3  percent  in  1978-80.    After  1978,  however,  the  growth  of&#13;
manufacturing  investment  became  grossly  negative  and manufacturing's&#13;
share in total investment declined from 31.3 percent in 1978-80 to 24.2&#13;
percent in 1981-82.&#13;
While manufactured imports grew at an average rate of 8.3&#13;
percent in 1963-77, manufactured exports attained a 6.0 percent average&#13;
growth and their share in total   exports increased  from 20.6 percent&#13;
to 31.2 percent in the same period. The growth rate of manufactured&#13;

exports, however, has not been steady:  for example, it was 0.0 percent&#13;
in 1963-70, 36.0 percent in 1970-73, and 2.0 percent in 1973-77.   The&#13;
major exchange rate adjustment in 1970 and the resulting increase in the&#13;
real exchange rate vis-a-vis the US dollar (see Table 2.1 in Chapter 2)&#13;
were responsible for the rapid growth of exports in 1970-73.  The sharp&#13;
increase in 1979 and 1980 (12.0 percent and 9.8 percent respectively),&#13;
is due mainly to the special trade relations established with the Middle&#13;
Eastern countries.   Then, substantial  policy changes in 1981 and 1982&#13;
produced remarkable growth rates of 131.7 percent in 1981 and 55 percent&#13;
in 1982.&#13;
Turkey's increasing trade deficit was financed by multilateral&#13;
foreign assistance in the 1960s, by workers' remittances and short-term&#13;
commercial borrowing in the 1970s, and by OECD, IMF, and World Bank&#13;
credits in the 1980s.&#13;
Manufacturing employment recorded an average growth rate of 3.3&#13;
percent between 1963 and 1977 and its share in total employment&#13;
increased from 7.8 percent in 1963-65 to 10.3 percent in 1978-80.   In&#13;
line with changes in production, mariufacturing employment declined in&#13;
1979 and 1980, but started rising afterwards.&#13;
Turkey tried to maintain the pace of industrialization after&#13;
1973.   In the face of stagnating exports, it resorted to heavy short-&#13;
term borrowing which eventually resulted in a rapid accumulation of&#13;
foreign debt ($16.6 billion in 1977,, about 30 percent of GNP) and a&#13;
collapse  of  international  confidence.   Credits were  cut.   A  severe&#13;
balance of payments crisis emerged at the end of 1977 which adversely&#13;
affected investment and production.&#13;

Product Mix and Investment&#13;
Table 1.2 sets out the product mix of manufacturing industry.&#13;
It indicates substantial  structural  change.   In 1981 the six largest&#13;
industries,   in   terms   of   value-added   were   food   and   beverages&#13;
(16.9 percent of total manufacturing value added), textiles and apparel&#13;
(15.7), chemicals (10.1), basic metals (9.1), nonmetallic mineral&#13;
products   (8.7),  and  petroleum  products  (7.9),  which  collectively&#13;
accounted for 68.4 percent of total manufacturing value added. In 1960,&#13;
however, the largest three - food and beverages (34.8), textiles and&#13;
apparel (20.9), and tobacco processing (9.9) - produced 65.6 percent of&#13;
the total.&#13;
The sectors whose growth rates were substantially above average&#13;
were  chemicals,   nonmetallic  mineral  products,  petroleum  products,&#13;
machinery,  electrical  machinery,  rubber  products,  basic  metals,  and&#13;
transport  equipment.    Their  collective  share  in  total  value  added&#13;
increased from 25.3 percent in 1960 to 55.1 percent in 1981.   Sectors&#13;
markedly below the average growth rate are food and beverages, tobacco&#13;
processing and textiles and apparel, whose collective share in total&#13;
value added decreased from 65.6 percent in 1960 to 36.8 percent in 1981.&#13;
Table 1.3 shows the shares of manufacturing industries in total&#13;
manufacturing investment in 1973-77 and 1978-81.  Six industries (basic&#13;
metals, textiles and apparel, petroleum products, chemicals, food and&#13;
beverages, and nonmetallic mineral products) absorbed 75 percent of&#13;
total investment in both periods.&#13;

increased the capital  intensity of mianufacturing production.   The new&#13;
investment brought successively smaller increments of output and created&#13;
fewer jobs per capital invested.   The incremental capital-output ratio&#13;
in manufacturing rose from 1.6 in 1963-67 to 2.9 in 1968-72 and to 4.7&#13;
in 1973-77, while the amount of capital per job created, expressed in&#13;
1976 prices, increased from TL 267 thousand to TL 363 thousand and,&#13;
finally, to TL 572 thousand (Balassa 1981: 302).&#13;
Ownership&#13;
The public sector has always had a large share in manufacturing&#13;
investment and production. However, its share has declined. At present&#13;
it absorbs 33 percent of total manufacturing investment and contributes&#13;
35 percent of total manufacturing value added by manufacturing firms&#13;
with 10 or more workers.   In 1960, its share in total  investment had&#13;
been 48.3 percent and in value added 60.8 percent.&#13;
The public sector share in value added in individual sectors is&#13;
shown in Table 1.2. It is apparent that public firms are dominant (over&#13;
50  percent)  in  food  and  beverages,  tobacco  processing,  petroleum,&#13;
products, and basic metals, but play, an insignificant role (under 10&#13;
percent) in rubber products, metal products and electrical machinery.&#13;
The public share in wood products and paper products is under 50&#13;
percent, but quite high (36.5 percent and 49.6 percent, respectively in&#13;
1981).&#13;
In six sectors out of the 16 sectors in Table 1.2 (tobacco&#13;
processing, wood products, printing and publishing, leather products,&#13;
rubber products, and chemicals), the public share has increased since&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
1960, whereas in the remaining ten it has decreased.  The loss of public&#13;
sector dominance is most pronounced in paper products, metal products,&#13;
machinery and transport equipment.   The public share in these sectors&#13;
decreased from 94.4 to 49.6, 57.8 to 7.1, 52.5 to 20.9 and 91.2 to 20.9&#13;
percent, respectively between 1960 and 1980.&#13;
There are enormous differences in size between enterprises of&#13;
public and private ownership.   Considering only the large firms,  the&#13;
average public manufacturing enterprise is about nine times the size of&#13;
the average private manufacturing enterprise (Ebiri 1979: 288).&#13;
The share of foreign-owned firms in value added and investment&#13;
is negligible (about 3 percent in both).&#13;
Foreign Trade&#13;
The share of manufactured exports in total merchandise exports&#13;
increased from 19.6 percent  in 1963  to 59.7 percent  in 1982.   The&#13;
composition of manufactured exports, which is set out in Table 1.4, has&#13;
changed considerably.   The share of food and beverages decreased from&#13;
54.7 percent in 1963 to 16.0 percent in 1981. But the share of textiles&#13;
increased from 3.9 percent to 36.6 percent in the same period.   New&#13;
products added to manufactured exports since 1963 are wood products,&#13;
cement, leather products, rubber products, basic metals, metal products,&#13;
machinery, electrical machinery, and transport equipment; together made&#13;
up 30.9 percent of manufactured exports in 1981.&#13;
Manufactured imports have represented about 60-70 percent of&#13;
total  merchandise  imports.   The share of consumption  goods has been&#13;
around 5 percent of the total. Chemicals (22.8 percent of total&#13;

Sources  of  growth  analysis  decomposes  total  demand  into&#13;
domestic demand, export demand, and import substitution, and then&#13;
estimates the relative contribution of each category in absorbing total&#13;
supply. As Table 1.6 indicates domestic demand expansion counts for the&#13;
most important demand category. The contribution of import substitution&#13;

has been negligible (an even negative in some periods).  This does not&#13;
imply, however, that import substitution has not taken place in Turkish&#13;
manufacturing.    On  the  contrary,  there  has been  substantial  import&#13;
substitution.      This  apparent  contradiction  can  be  resolved  by&#13;
differentiating  between  gross  and  net  import  substitituion.    Gross&#13;
import substitution is related to the industrial structure.  Net import&#13;
substitution represents net foreign exchange savings and is relevent for&#13;
the balance of payments and grc;th.&#13;
The contribution of exports to growth has been uneven;&#13;
insignificant in 1963-68 and negative in 1973-77, but significant in&#13;
1968-73  and  1981-84.    One  should  note  that  in  1973-77,  when  the&#13;
contribution of exports was negative, Turkey tried to maintain its&#13;
growth momentum in the face of oil price increases and the subsequent&#13;
world recession. The significant contribution of exports during 1968-73&#13;
and 1981-84 was due to the exchange rate and other export-promotion&#13;
policies adopted in 1970 and since 1980.&#13;

4.       ACHIEVEMENTS AND PROBLEMS&#13;
The achievements of the Turkish manufacturing industry have&#13;
been substantial.   The growth rate of value added averaged 10 percent&#13;
between 1963 and 1967.   There has been a substantial amount of import&#13;
substitution, particularly in consumer durables, transport equipment,&#13;
machinery,  petroleum  products,  chemicals,  fertilizers,  and  iron  and&#13;
steel. This has been accompanied by the introduction of a wide range of&#13;
new techniques into the economy, yielding a considerable learning effect&#13;
and inducing the development of new skills.&#13;
These achievements, however, should not conceal the following&#13;
serious shortcomings and problems of the industry.&#13;
1.       Low level and slow growth of manufactured exports.   Except in&#13;
1970-73 and after 1981 manufacturing exports have stagnated.&#13;
This is due to the anti-export bias created by the system of&#13;
incentives and exchange rate polciy.  1/   These policies are&#13;
reviewed  in  Chapter  II.    Owing  to  the  sustained  real&#13;
devaluation and the other export incentives, export growth was&#13;
spectacular in 1970-73 (36 percent annual average) and after&#13;
1981  (131.7 percent in 1981 and 55 percent in 1982).   This&#13;
indicates that manufacturing exports are indeed sensitive to&#13;
policy changes. On the small country assumption, the following&#13;
equation  was  estimated  to  work  out  the  sensitivity  of&#13;
manufactured exports to trade policies (Yagci 1983):&#13;
1/  Krueger (1974:   187) estimates that in the 1950s and 1960s the TL&#13;
receipts from a dollar's worth of exports averaged half of the TL&#13;
receipts from a dollar's worth of import substitution.&#13;

The  second  term  on  the  ri(ht-hand side,  which reflects the&#13;
effect of export policies, has a significant coefficient with&#13;
the correct sign.&#13;
2.       Slow  growth  of manufacturing  employment.   The manufacturing&#13;
industry has created about one million new jobs in two decades&#13;
which is less than the employment created for Turkey in the&#13;
European markets in the same period. This state of affairs can&#13;
be ascribed to the distortions created in factor prices.&#13;
Imported  capital  is  largely  exempt  from  import  duties  and&#13;
taxes,  and  overvalued  exchange  rates  further  decrease  its&#13;
price.  That real interest rates were negative until 1981 when&#13;
interest rates were decontrolled, had provided additional&#13;
incentive for the use of capiital-intensive techniques.&#13;
3.       Deterioration  of  income  distribution.    High  manufacturing&#13;
growth was associated with a worsening of income distribution&#13;
(see Ozbudun and Ulusan 1981).   The principal causes were the&#13;
huge and increasing differences in inter-sector productivity (4&#13;
to 5 folds between agriculture and industry) and the inability&#13;
of the manufacturing sector to absorb agricultural surplus&#13;
labor.&#13;

CHAPTER II&#13;
THE SYSTEM OF INCENTIVES AND PROTECTION&#13;
1.       INTRODUCTION&#13;
The high emphasis and priority given to the manufacturing&#13;
industry in Turkey necessitated setting up a system of protection and&#13;
incentives to direct economic activities in desired directions. In this&#13;
chapter  the  main  instruments  of  this  system  are  described  and&#13;
evaluated.  1/   The  incentive  and comparative advantage  coefficients&#13;
estimated in this study reflect the incidence of these instruments in&#13;
1981, the survey year.&#13;
2.       EXCHANGE RATE&#13;
Turkey  has  pursued  a  fixed  exchange   rate  policy  with&#13;
infrequent,   irregular,   and  unpredictable   official   exchange   rate&#13;
adjustments. The excess demand for foreign exchange has been curbed by&#13;
stringent controls on trade and exchange flows.   With the exception of&#13;
brief periods in the early 1960s and the 1970s, the official exchange&#13;
rate was overvalued until 1980.   The overvaluation reached its peak in&#13;
1979 (Table 2.1).   Overvaluation has aggravated the existing bias in&#13;
incentives against exporters created by tariffs and the wide use of QRs.&#13;
Bias   is defined as   the relative profitability of supplying&#13;
the domestic as compared with the export market. It depends on the&#13;

exchange rate,.&#13;
There has always been a political resistance to conventional&#13;
devaluation in Turkey based on export pessimism and inflationary&#13;
considerations.    The  multiple  exchange  rate  system  has  been  used&#13;
occasionally to varying degrees as an alternative, to compensate for the&#13;
perverse effects of the overvalued official exchange rate.  The general&#13;
tendency has been to apply a lower rate to agricultural exports and to&#13;
imports of fertilizers and petroleum products and a higher rate to all&#13;
other transactions, with still higher rates given to remittances of&#13;
Turkish workers abroad.&#13;
More flexibility has been introduced into the exchange rate&#13;
policy since 1980.  There was a 70 percent devaluation in January 1980,&#13;
and frequent adjustments thereafter. Since May 1981, the exchange rate&#13;
has been adjusted daily by the Central  Bank.   As a result the real&#13;
exchange rate vis-a-vis the US dollar has appreciated since 1980.&#13;
3.       IMPORT PROTECTION&#13;
Import controls have been applied in Turkey both to ease the&#13;
balance  of  payments  imbalance  and  to  protect  the  import-competing&#13;
activities, with varying weights in different periods.&#13;
Under     its    heavy    emphasis    on    import-substitution&#13;
industrialization, Turkey has provided extensive protection to domestic&#13;
producers through tariffs and quantitative import restrictions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
Tariff Protection&#13;
Tariffs protect import-competing industries by increasing their&#13;
domestic  prices  and attracting  resources  into them.   This creates a&#13;
domestic market bias at the expense of exports.&#13;
For the products included in the sample, the average tariff&#13;
rate and the other tariff-like charges is 49 percent on non-EEC imports&#13;
and 42 percent on EEC imports (see Table 5.1).   This latter enter at&#13;
preferential rates in the framework of Turkey's Association Agreement&#13;
with the EEC. These rates are the averages for the products included in&#13;
our sample.   However, they are very close to the average rates for all&#13;
manufacturing products, estimated at 53 percent on non-EEC imports and&#13;
44 percent on EEC imports (World Bank 1982:  93).&#13;
The tariff-like charges added to the tariffs include municipal&#13;
tax, stamp duty, quay charges, and transaction tax, collectively&#13;
averaging around three quarters of the basic tariff rate. 1/&#13;
As indicated in Table 5.1 there is considerable variation in&#13;
tariff rates 2/ among the sectors included in the sample.   They range&#13;
from   zero   percent   (for   chemicals,   petrochemicals,   fertilizers,&#13;
pharmaceuticals, sugar, flour, and tea) to 216 percent (for synthetic&#13;
yarn) on non-EEC imports.   In general, the rates are higher (over 100&#13;
1/  In principle, the transaction tax should not be added to the tariff&#13;
because  it  also  applies  domestic  production.    An adjustment  is&#13;
necessary only if the rates cliffer for domestic and imported&#13;
products.   The reported tariff rates,  therefore, overestimate the&#13;
protective effect of the tariff structure.&#13;
2/  In this  report,  "tariff  rate"  covers  all  tariff and tariff-like&#13;
charges when it refers to Turkey.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
percent) on finished products, such as textiles, leather products, wood&#13;
products, glassware, plastics, and metal products, and are somewhat&#13;
lower on semi-finished goods, capital goods, and raw materials.&#13;
There have been minor modifications in the current tariff&#13;
structure  since  1973 when  the  last  revision was  made.   There  is a&#13;
"general tariff" applied to non-EEC goods, and a lower tariff applied to&#13;
imports from the EEC.  These lower rates are part of the Annex Protocol&#13;
which Turkey signed in 1970 with the EEC, setting the conditions of&#13;
transition  to  full  membership  in 1995.    Imports  from  the  EEC were&#13;
divided into two lists.   Turkey agreed to eliminate the tariffs on the&#13;
commodities on list 1 (50 percent of all imports from the EEC in 1973)&#13;
by 1985 and the tariffs on the commodities on list 2 1/ by 1995.&#13;
Starting from 1973 the tariffs on the commodities on lists 1 and 2 were&#13;
reduced by 20 percent and 10 percent,  respectively, by 1978.   Turkey&#13;
decided to "freeze" her relations with the EEC in 1978 and has postponed&#13;
further scheduled tariff reductions.&#13;
Quantitative Restrictions&#13;
In addition to tariffs, Turkish manufacturing has received&#13;
considerable protection through a complex system of quotas, import&#13;
licensing, and exchange controls.&#13;
-Imports are regulated by means of Import Programs since 1958.&#13;
These are prepared by the Ministry of Commerce after negotiations with&#13;
the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  Central   Bank,  the  State  Planning&#13;
1/ List 2 includes most of the Turkish import-competing goods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
Organization   (SPO),  and  the  Union  of  Chambers  of  Commerce  and&#13;
Industry.    Apart  from  the  regulations  governing  importation,  each&#13;
program enumerates the commodities eligible for importation under each&#13;
of the two lists: the Liberalized List and the Quota List. Commodities&#13;
not enumerated on either list are not legally importable.   These last&#13;
commodities  are  referred  to  by  Krueger  (1974)  as  being  on  the&#13;
"Prohibited  List";  they  include  principal  durable  and  non-durable&#13;
consumer goods.&#13;
The Quota List imports varied between 15 and 30 percent of&#13;
total imports in the 1960s and 1970s.   Under the 1981 Import Program,&#13;
the Quota List was abolished.&#13;
In  1969,  the  Liberalized  List  was  divided  in  two:    the&#13;
Liberalized List 1, consisting of intermediate inputs and spare parts&#13;
not produced domestically, and Liberalized List 2, covering intermediate&#13;
and final goods manufactured in Turkey.   Free importation was allowed&#13;
for the former and the licensing scheme was retained for the latter.&#13;
Liberalized List 1 has covered about 15 percent of total  imports and&#13;
Liberalized List 2, about 50 percent.&#13;
The other important categories of imports not included in the&#13;
Import Program are the Bilateral Agreement Imports (the goods eligible&#13;
for importation from countries with which Turkey has bilateral  trade&#13;
agreements)  and  Self-Financed  Imports  (mainly  capital  goods  imports&#13;
under project aid), which together have covered 10 to 15 percent of&#13;
total imports.&#13;
There is evidence that the degree of QRs has been intensified&#13;
in the 1960s.   Krueger (1974) shows that there was a definite tendency&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
to shift importable items, once they were domestically produced, from&#13;
the Liberalized List to the Quota List, and eventually to the&#13;
"Prohibited List."&#13;
Foreign transactions in Turkey have always been administered&#13;
under exchange controls. Commercial banks have been allowed to retain a&#13;
limited  amount  of  the  foreign  exchange  deposited  with  them.    In&#13;
addition, foreign exchange allocations have been made following the&#13;
deposit of a cash guarantee with the Central Bank:   these allocations&#13;
have varied according to the type of imports (industrial or commercial)&#13;
and according to the list under which the importation was undertaken.&#13;
The rate of guarantee deposits was set as high as 150 percent of the&#13;
value of imports in the late 1960s.&#13;
However, the situation has changed somewhat in the last four&#13;
years. As part of the stabilization program of January 1980, the Quota&#13;
List was abolished in January 1981. Some of the items in the Quota List&#13;
(9 percent of the total value of the Quota List in 1980, 0.8 percent of&#13;
total imports) were transferred to Liberalized List 1 and the remaining&#13;
items  were  moved  to  Liberalized  List  2.    In  addition,  some  253&#13;
commodities have been shifted from Liberalized List 2 to Liberalized&#13;
List 1 in the following three years.   The "Prohibited List," however,&#13;
has been retained.&#13;
In January 1980 import regulations were also simplified and&#13;
commercial banks were allowed to retain a higher proportion of foreign&#13;
exchange deposits with them. In 1981 guarantee deposits were reduced to&#13;
10 percent for industrial importers and to 20 percent for commercial&#13;
importers, for imports under Liberalized Lists 1 and 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
Of  course,  tariffs  and  non-tariff  levies  provide  only  an&#13;
impressionistic view of the system ol protection in Turkey.  Protection&#13;
has also been granted through quantitative restrictions.   The system of&#13;
quotas, licensing, and exchange controls has created a complex system of&#13;
QRs in Turkey. Domestic and world prices have been completely separated&#13;
and domestic production has enjoyed absolute protection.&#13;
The import premium created by QRs has been considerable. One&#13;
study 1/ compares import prices (c.i.f), landed costs (import price +&#13;
tariff + tariff-like charges), and domestic wholesale prices (landed&#13;
cost + import premium) of 74 commodities, representing 8.6 percent of&#13;
Turkey's imports in 1968. It turned out that, for 31 commodities in the&#13;
sample, the premium exceeded the landed cost; for 27 of these 31, the&#13;
difference exceeded 100 percent of the landed cost.&#13;
4.       EXPORT INCENTIVES&#13;
The second stage of import substitution has substantially&#13;
increased import requirements  in Turkey in the last two decades.   To&#13;
enable the importation of the capital goods and intermediate inputs&#13;
needed for the growth of the industrial sector, a series of measures has&#13;
been taken to provide incentives for industrial exports:   indirect tax&#13;
rebates,  access  to  preferential   export  credit,   foreign  exchange&#13;
allocation and retention, and temporary import permits. 2/ However, the&#13;
impact of these measures had been limited until 1980, because the&#13;
overvalued exchange rate had negated these positive incentives.&#13;
1/ Krueger (1974: 173-178).&#13;
2/ For further information see SPO (1982, 1983) and World Bank (1982).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Export Tax Rebate&#13;
The export tax rebate scheme was introduced in 1963 to help&#13;
compensate industrial exporters for the indirect taxes they paid on&#13;
their  domestic  inputs  and outputs.    In practice,  however,  the  link&#13;
between the rebates and the indirect taxes has not been strong.&#13;
The number of products included in the scheme has been&#13;
increased substantially and rates have been changed frequently to offset&#13;
the export disincentives inherent in the exchange rate policy and the&#13;
import  protection.    Supplementary  rates  have  been  granted  to those&#13;
exporters exceeding a predetermined level of total exports.&#13;
The scheme was extended in 1969 to cover fresh fruits and&#13;
vegetables, cotton, meat and forest products.   The number of products&#13;
included in the scheme has increased from 98 in 1970 to about 500 in&#13;
1983.&#13;
Individual rates varied between 5 and 45 percent of the f.o.b.&#13;
price of exports.  In general, the rates have been increased during the&#13;
balance-of-payments stringency and decreased after foreign exchange&#13;
adjustments.   Commodities were also transferred among lists,  usually&#13;
from lists with lower rebate rates to lists with higher rebate rates&#13;
(World Bank 1982: 61).&#13;
Initially the rebate rates were set individually.   In 1970 the&#13;
system was simplified by grouping the export commodities into 4 lists&#13;
and applying a common rate to the f.o.b export value of all commodities&#13;
on the list.   The number of lists was increased to 6 in 1973 and 10 in&#13;
1975.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
After the 1980 devaluation, rebate rates were substantially&#13;
reduced.   But in 1981 all rates were increased by 5 percentage points&#13;
across the board and commodities were reshuffled among lists.   In 1982&#13;
and 1983 further increases in the baisic and supplementary rates were&#13;
granted.&#13;
The export tax rebate scheme may not provide an export&#13;
incentive if it merely compensates for the indirect taxes paid on&#13;
domestic inputs and outputs.   To calculate the subsidy element of the&#13;
scheme, one should adjust the rebate rates for indirect taxes.  But the&#13;
data are not available.  Assuming that the rebate rates granted in 1980&#13;
exactly compensated for the indirect taxes paid on inputs, 1/ the net&#13;
subsidy element of the tax rebate scheme in the survey year (1981) is&#13;
estimated as the difference between the rebate rates in 1981 and 1980.&#13;
The results are presented in Table 2'.2 for the 18 manufacturing sub-&#13;
sectors for which data are available.   As will be seen in Chapter IV,&#13;
these net rebate rates are substantially lower than the tariff and non-&#13;
tariff protection on domestic sales.   Therefore, the export tax rebate&#13;
scheme eliminates only a part of the anti-export bias.&#13;
Subsidized Export Credit&#13;
Since 1968 exporters have been granted short-term credit at&#13;
preferential rates to finance production, purchases, storage, packing,&#13;
and transportation of goods for export.   Since 1980 they have received&#13;
subsidized medium- and long-term credits to finance export-oriented&#13;
1/ In 1980 TL was devalued by 70 percent against the US dollar and the&#13;
export tax rebate rates were substantially reduced.&#13;

investments.    Export-oriented  investments  also  enjoy  remissions  of&#13;
customs duties on investment goods and income as well as corporation tax&#13;
allowances of 50 percent, instead of the general rate of 30 percent.&#13;
(Investment incentives are reviewed later in this Chapter.)&#13;
Table 2.3 compares the interest subsidy on short-term export&#13;
credits with that on general non-preferential short-term credits. There&#13;
are four subsidy elements in short-term export credits; (a) a lower&#13;
basic rate, (b) exemption from the transaction tax (15 percent of the&#13;
basic rate on non-preferential credit), (c) a lower contribution to&#13;
Interest Rate Rebate Fund (IRRF), 1/ and (d) a subsidy from IRRF (35&#13;
percent of the basic rate).&#13;
The total  subsidy is estimated in the following way.   The 36&#13;
percent basic rate is taken to be the norm. 36 - 25 = 11 percent is the&#13;
subsidy on the basic rate.   Ignoring the commission, the net subsidy of&#13;
6.3 percent from IRRF (8.8 - 2.5 - 6.3) brings the total subsidy to 17.3&#13;
percent of the credit granted.&#13;
The credit limit, on average, is 80 percent of export receipts&#13;
with a term of 8 to 12 months. Commercial banks are encouraged to grant&#13;
export credits through (a) automatic refinancing by the Central Bank of&#13;
up to 75 percent 2/ of the credit at a lower rediscount rate, (b) a&#13;
lower reserve ratio, and (c) rebates from IRRF (10 percentage points&#13;
since August 1981).&#13;

The use of export credits has increased rapidly (Table 2.4) and&#13;
high subsidies have led to leakages of export credits to domestic&#13;
operations. The expansion was so rapid after 1980 that the Central Bank&#13;
was forced to occasionally suspend or delay the rediscounting of export&#13;
credits to stay within the constraints imposed by the tight monetary&#13;
policy.&#13;
As will be seen in Chapter IV the generous interest subsidy&#13;
provided to exporters has somewhat reduced the bias against exports.&#13;

packing  materials  in  export  production,  as  well  as  for  the  duty-&#13;
inclusive importation of capital goods. The imported goods did not need&#13;
to be on any of the import lists.   The maximum rate of allocation was&#13;
increased from 50 to 60 percent of the export pledge.   In addition, a&#13;
retrospective  foreign  exchange  allocation  was  also  provided.    Since&#13;
1981,  firms  that  have  obtained  subsidized  export  credits  and  have&#13;
fulfilled their export pledge may apply for foreign exchange allocations&#13;
for the importation of intermediate and capital goods to be used in&#13;
future export production. This allocation can not exceed 80 percent of&#13;
the f.o.b value of the pledged exports, half of it may be used for duty-&#13;
free importation.&#13;
Allocation under this scheme has not exceeded 5 percent of&#13;
total non-oil intermediate inputs.  The subsidy element of this scheme&#13;
has been significant only in the high import stringency periods of the&#13;
late 1960s and 1970s.&#13;
Duty-free   importation   is  an  important  export  incentive,&#13;
however,  that; reduces the cost of exports in foreign exchange markets&#13;
despite the fact that the foreign exchange allocation scheme permits&#13;
only a part of inputs of export production to be obtained duty-free.&#13;
Foreign Exchange Retention Scheme&#13;
In the 1960s industrial exporters were allowed to retain up to&#13;
50 percent of their export earnings to finance their own import&#13;
requirement.   After the 1970 devaluation, this figure was reduced to 25&#13;
percent.    It was  increased  to  50  percent  again  in  1979,  when  the&#13;
difference between the official and the parallel market was very wide.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
In addition, in 1979, exporters were allowed to transfer these rights to&#13;
their suppliers at mutually agreed prices. In 1980, foreign contractors&#13;
and fresh fruit and vegetable exporters were also included in the&#13;
scheme,  with  a 10 percent  retention  rate.   Besides,  exporters were&#13;
allowed to transfer their rights not only to their suppliers but also to&#13;
any industrial user at competitive prices.&#13;
The average realized retention has varied between 5 and 10&#13;
percent of industrial  exports.   The subsidy element involved in this&#13;
scheme was significant in the late 1960s and 1970s.  These periods were&#13;
characterized by severe import shortages and a substantial differential&#13;
between official and parallel market exchange rates.&#13;
By compensating for the overvaluation of the official exchange&#13;
rate this scheme has reduced the bias against industrial exports, but at&#13;
the same time it has discriminated against traditional agricultural&#13;
exports.&#13;
Corporation Tax Allowances&#13;
Amendments were made to the Corporation Tax in 1980 to allow&#13;
industrial exporters with annual export revenues exceeding $250,000 to&#13;
deduct 20 percent of their export revenues from taxable income.   This&#13;
incentive has also been extended to exporters of fresh fruit and&#13;
vegetables  and  to  firms  engaged  in  tourism.   Contracting  companies&#13;
abroad are fully exempted from the corporation and income tax.  If the&#13;
exportation is done through a trading company, one fourth of the tax&#13;
deduction is given to the trading company.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
This scheme provides significant incentives to exporters.   The&#13;
actual  benefit  is  somewhat  reduced,  however,  as  a  result  of  the&#13;
withholding tax applied to deductions from taxable income.&#13;
Temporary Import Scheme&#13;
This scheme was introduced in 1970 to allow industrialists&#13;
holding a purchase order from a foreign firm to import the required&#13;
inputs.   Initially,  industrialists deposited tariffs on the requisite&#13;
imports,  which were  then refunded  in full  upon export.   Since 1980,&#13;
intermediate inputs have been imported duty-free and the foreign&#13;
exchange allocation under this scheme may go up to 80 percent of the&#13;
export revenues.&#13;
The realized foreign exchange allocation under the temporary&#13;
import regime has been negligible (less than one percent of total non-&#13;
oil imports on average).&#13;
Price Control and Licensing in Exports&#13;
The major instruments of QRs used in connection with exports&#13;
are export licensing and price registration.&#13;
Apart  from  the  traditional  exports  such  as  cereals,  nuts,&#13;
raisins, figs and metal ores, a variety of industrial commodities (meat,&#13;
margarine,   olive  oil,   etc.)  have  also  been  subject  to  export&#13;
licensing.     Minimum  export  prices  for  various  agricultural   and&#13;
industrial exports have also been set, primarily to prevent capital&#13;
flight.&#13;
In 1980, price controls on exports were substantially reduced&#13;
and  export  licensing  was  relaxed.    The  export  regime  was  further&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
liberalized in 1982.   The number of items requiring an export license&#13;
was reduced from 25 to 2:  tobacco and opium.  In addition, the number&#13;
of goods subject to price registration was reduced from 40 to 30.&#13;
5.       INVESTMENT INCENTIVES&#13;
During  the  1960s  a  seriies  of  investment  incentives  were&#13;
introduced  to  direct  investment  toward  the  desired  sub-sectors  and&#13;
regions  indicated  in  the  5-year  plans  and  annual  programs.    The&#13;
instruments  used  to  administer  these  incentives   have  been  the&#13;
following:   (i) income and corporation tax allowances  (introduced in&#13;
1963),  (ii) tariff and duty deferrals (1969) or exemptions  (1969)  in&#13;
capital goods importation, and (iii) interest rebates (1970).&#13;
Investment incentives are administered by the Department of&#13;
Incentives and Implementation (TUD) at the SPO through the General&#13;
Incentive Table (GIT), published yearly with the annual program and&#13;
prepared according to the plan priorities.   This table specifies the&#13;
sub-sectors and regions in which the investment should be made to be&#13;
eligible for investment incentives as well as the types of incentives to&#13;
be applied for.&#13;
Tariff benefits are granted if the imported capital good is&#13;
new.   The amount of the interest  rebate varies from one investment&#13;
project to another and is paid out of IRRF, maintained by the Central&#13;
Bank  and  financed  by  levies  on  non-preferential   credits   (IRRF&#13;
contributions).&#13;
Currently, firms are allowed to deduct 30 percent of the cost&#13;
of approved fixed investment from their taxable income if the investment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
is made in the designated sub-sectors in the manufacturing industry.&#13;
Deductions  are  40  percent  for  eligible   investment  projects  in&#13;
agriculture and 60 percent for eligible investments in underdeveloped&#13;
regions.     Investment  incentives  were  extended  to  export-oriented&#13;
investment in 1981 at a rate of 50 percent.&#13;
To be eligible, investment projects in the manufacturing&#13;
industry should exceed TL 20 million. The cost of the project should be&#13;
at least TL 4 million in agriculture and TL 10 million in underdeveloped&#13;
regions.    In addition,  40 percent  of the cost of projects must be&#13;
financed from own sources.   The share of own equity finance may be 30&#13;
percent for projects in the underdeveloped regions and 10 percent for&#13;
investment   in  shipbuilding  and  livestock.          The  export-oriented&#13;
investment to be eligible, at least 75 percent of the annual production&#13;
has to be exported for a period of 5 years, with annual exports not&#13;
falling below $500,000 ($250,000 in underdeveloped regions).&#13;
One final restriction, introduced in 1981, was that no carry&#13;
forward of any excess of the allowance over taxable income would be&#13;
permitted.&#13;
Corporation and income tax allowances have provided substantial&#13;
financial  benefits  to  firms.    On  average,  three-quarters  of  total&#13;
private investment has been eligible and has actually benefitted from&#13;
the tax allowances.   The revenue loss for Government has varied between&#13;
3 to 5 percent of the budget revenue.&#13;
Table 2.5 shows the sectoral distribution of tax allowances.&#13;
In value terms 89.4 percent of total tax allowances were granted to the&#13;
manufacturing  industry  in  1968-75.  After  1980  sectoral  priorities&#13;

- 40-&#13;
changed   somewhat.       Following   the   export  boom,   investment   in&#13;
international  road transportation has been encouraged.   As a result,&#13;
41.2 percent of tax allowances were given to the services sector in&#13;
1980-82. This reduced the share of manufacturing to 50.3 percent in the&#13;
same period. Within the manufacturing industry sectoral composition has&#13;
also changed.  From 1968-75 to 1980-82 emphasis shifted from chemicals,&#13;
textiles, leather products, and electrical and non-electrical machinery&#13;
to transport equipment, particularly to trucks and buses, for which&#13;
export to the Middle Eastern countries have increased substantially.&#13;
Despite the higher tax allowances, investment has not been&#13;
attracted  to Turkey's  underdeveloped  regions.   Only 10.6 percent of&#13;
total tax allowances were given to investment projects made in the&#13;
Eastern and the South-Eastern Anatolia (the least developed regions in&#13;
Turkey) in 1968-75 and only 7.3 percent in 1980-82 (Table 2.6).&#13;
6.       ADDITIONAL INCENTIVES TO PUBLIC FIRMS&#13;
The incentives we have considered so far are given to all&#13;
firms,  whether they are publicly  or privately owned.   The following&#13;
incentives are granted to state economic enterprises (SEE) only.&#13;
1.  Tariff and duty exemption is granted to some of the SEEs (Petkim,&#13;
Seka, MKE, etc.) even for production for the domestic market.  This&#13;
firm-specific privilege is given by special government decrees if&#13;
their production is considered "essential for Turkey's long-term&#13;
development."&#13;
2. A 35 percent corporation tax rate for the SEEs, as compared to a 40&#13;
percent tax rate for private firms, provides a 5 percent tax benefit&#13;
to SEEs.&#13;

3.  SEEs obtain a high proportion  of their credits  from the Central&#13;
Bank, the State Investment Bank (DYB), and other publicly owned&#13;
financial   institutions(Sumerbank,   Etibank,   etc.)   at   heavily&#13;
subsidized rates.  The interest rate in the survey year ranged from&#13;
10 percent for the Central Bank to 21.5 percent for the DYB credits&#13;
depending on the type of the credit and the nature of use.   In&#13;
addition, these credits are exempted from the transaction tax (15&#13;
percent) and the IRRF contribution (15 percent).   If the credit is&#13;
obtained from commercial banks, SEEs pay only the transaction tax&#13;
(5.7 percentage points), but also receive an interest rebate from&#13;
IRRF (5 percentage points).   In this latter case commercial banks&#13;
also receive one percentage point rebate from IRRF. Compared with&#13;

the 48.8 percent effective interest cost 1/ on non-preferential&#13;
short-term  credit  available  for  private  firms,  these  heavily&#13;
subsidized interest rates provide substantial additional financial&#13;
benefits to SEEs.&#13;
7.       ADMINISTRATION OF INCENTIVES&#13;
Investment  incentives  are  monitored  by  TUD  through  GIT,&#13;
published every year with the annual programs.   GIT indicates the sub-&#13;
sectors and regions in which the investment should be made if it is to&#13;
be eligible  for investment incentives as well as the benefits to be&#13;
applied. GIT is prepared in the light of 5-year plan priorities.&#13;
Regulation of export incentives is less formalized.  The types&#13;
of export incentives are set and modified by decrees as necessary.&#13;
In 1982, the administration of all  incentive measures, which&#13;
had been dispersed among SPO, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of&#13;
Commerce and the Ministry of Industry, was centralized in TUD at the&#13;
SPO.&#13;

estimated coefficients.   The nominal protection coefficients (NPC) are&#13;
estimated by comparing the c.i.f. import prices and the ex-factory&#13;
prices to take account of the effects of QRs.   Net export tax rebate&#13;
rates are reflected in the NPCs on export sales.  Tariff rates are used&#13;
to calculate the NPCs on imported inputs.   In the case of duty-free&#13;
1/ This excludes the effect of compensatory balances which further&#13;
increases the cost.&#13;

importation,  the NPCs on imported  inputs are taken to be one.   All&#13;
investment incentives and additional incentives to SEEs are included in&#13;
the calculation of the effective subsidy coefficients (ESC).   Foreign&#13;
exchange allocation and foreign exchange retention are not considered in&#13;
the calculation of the ESCs on export sales because their subsidy effect&#13;
was minimal in 1981 due to a more realistic exchange rate policy.&#13;

CHAPTER III&#13;
SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS&#13;
1.       SAMPLE REPRESENTATION&#13;
The estimation of the indicators of incentives and comparative&#13;
advantage is based on data obtained from a sample survey of 123&#13;
manufacturing firms, 19 of which are public, in 66 manufacturing sub-&#13;
sectors.   The questionnaire was sent to 353 firms, selected to yield a&#13;
high representation of both public and private activities; at least two&#13;
firms were  selected for each sub-sector.   Only 165 of the 353 firms&#13;
responded. Their questionnaires were then checked for the completeness&#13;
and consistency and 42 of them turned out to be unusable. The remaining&#13;
123 responding firms constitute the data base of the estimations.&#13;
Out of the 86 4-digit ISIC industries, 66 are covered.  At the&#13;
3-digit   level,   the   excluded   industries   are  beverages,   tobacco&#13;
manufactures, printing and publishing, petroleum refining, and pottery,&#13;
china and earthenware; these excluded industries produced 20.1 percent&#13;
of Turkey's total manufacturing output in 1981.&#13;
As Table 3.1 indicates 123 firms cover 22.0 percent of the&#13;
total manufacturing output of the 66 sectors included in the sample.&#13;
The rate of representation in the public and private sectors are 46.5&#13;
and 14.3 percent, respectively. The average size of the sample's public&#13;
firms was several times higher than that of the private firms, and the&#13;
19 public firms produced almost half of the total output in the public&#13;
sector.    The  highest  rate  of  representation  is  in wood  and  paper&#13;
products  (52.3  percent),  followed  by  non-ferrous   metals   (33.5),&#13;

2.       SECTOR CHARACTERISTICS&#13;
Table 3.1 presents some macro ratios for total manufacturing&#13;
and 14 sectors.   There are substantial differences among manufacturing&#13;
activities and between public and private sectors in output/labor,&#13;
capital/labor, capital/output, export/output, and import/output ratios.&#13;
The output/labor ratios for total manufacturing in the public&#13;
and  private  sectors  are  TL  5.48  million  and  TL  3.01  million,&#13;
respectively, indicating 82.1 percent higher labor productivity in the&#13;
private sector.   Variation  among  sectors  is very high.   The highest&#13;
output/labor ratio is observed in the case of rubber and plastics (TL&#13;
9.11 million), and the lowest is in leather products (1.94). The ratio&#13;
is higher in the private sector in seven of the nine sectors where both&#13;
public and private firms are represented; the exceptions are chemicals&#13;
and cement and glass.&#13;
For total manufacturing, the average capital/output ratios in&#13;
the public and private sectors are 2.11 and .70, respectively.   This&#13;
implies that, on average, the productivity of capital in the private&#13;
sector is three times that of the public sector.   The capital/output&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
ratios are higher in the public sector in all cases except in the case&#13;
of  textiles  and  electrical  machinery.          In  the  14  sectors  the&#13;
capital/output ratios range from 3.08 in wood and paper products to .20&#13;
in measuring equipment.&#13;
The  capital/labor  ratio  in  the  public  sector  for  total&#13;
manufacturing (TL 6.35 million) is higher, on average, than that in the&#13;
private sector (3.67).   The situation is reversed, however, in the case&#13;
of food, textiles, iron and steel products, non-ferrous metals, and&#13;
electrical  machinery.    The  low value  of capital/labor  ratio  in  the&#13;
public sector in textiles (.74) is due to the revaluation of the capital&#13;
stock;  revaluation  did  not  go back  before  1953 although  one  public&#13;
textile firm was established in 1851.   Very high capital/labor ratios&#13;
are observed in the public sector in the case of chemicals (37.25), iron&#13;
and steel (9.60), and wood and paper products (9.41).  The highest ratio&#13;
in the private sector is in iron and steel  (10.63).   The sectors with&#13;
relatively low capital/labor ratios (less than 2.00) are leather&#13;
products (1.17), textiles (1.58), cement and glass (1.34), metal&#13;
products (1.14), machinery (1.81), electrical machinery (1.38) and&#13;
measuring equipment (.50).&#13;
As one might expect, there is a close relationship among&#13;
capital/labor, output/labor, and capital/output ratios. As indicated in&#13;
Figure 3.1, the higher the capital/labor ratio, the higher is the&#13;
productivity of labor but the lower is the productivity of capital.&#13;
There is not much difference between the public and private&#13;
sectors in value-added ratios in total manufacturing; 32.4 and 31.4&#13;
percent,      respectively.       Broken  down  by  sector,   however,   the&#13;
difference is wide, particularly in textiles, leather products, cement&#13;

and  glass,   iron  and  steel,   non-ferrous  metals,  and  electrical&#13;
machinery. With the exception of food, chemicals, and cement and glass,&#13;
value-added  ratios  are  higher  in  the  public  sector.    This  can  be&#13;
explained mainly by the SEEs' privileged access to duty-free imports. A&#13;
second possible explanation lies in the understatement of value-added in&#13;
the private sector for purposes of tax evasion, a wide-spread practice&#13;
in the Turkey.&#13;
The   export/output   and   import/output   ratios   for   total&#13;
manufacturing are 2.5 and 7.4 percent for the public sector and 10.5 and&#13;
18.9 percent for the private sector. This indicates a 4.9 percent trade&#13;
deficit for the public sector and an 8.4 percent for the private&#13;
sector.   Although  the private  sector exported more  than  the public&#13;
sector, it also imported more and therefore incurred a higher trade&#13;
deficit.      The   import/output   ratio   in   the   public   sector   is&#13;
underestimated, however, because the SEEs obtain many of their imports&#13;
duty-free.&#13;
Broken down by economic activity, the import/output ratios in&#13;
the public sector are lower than in the private sector except for non-&#13;
ferrous metals. There are three cases in the public sector in which the&#13;
import/output ratio exceeds 15.0 percent:   chemicals (17.5), iron and&#13;
steel  products  (18.7), and non-ferrous metals  (17.5).   The number of&#13;
such cases in the private sector is six:  chemicals (27.3), rubber and&#13;
plastics  (16.8),  iron  and  steel  (35.0),  non-ferrous  metals  (16.3),&#13;
machinery (15.6) and transport equipment (32.3).&#13;
Export/output ratios are also lower in the public sector,&#13;
except for non-ferrous metals and electrical machinery. There are three&#13;
cases in the private sector in which export/output ratio exceeds 15.0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
percent; textiles (17.6), leather products (35.3), and cement and glass&#13;
(29.9). There is no such case in the public sector.&#13;
Not all manufacturing activities exhibit trade deficit.   Food&#13;
and cement and glass in the public sector have a trade surplus.  Those&#13;
sectors with a trade surplus in the private sector are food, textiles,&#13;
leather products, wood and paper products, cement and glass, and metal&#13;
products.&#13;
3.       DISTRIBUTION OF SUBSIDIES&#13;
Table 3.2 summarizes the distribution of various subsidies&#13;
between the public and private sectors and between production for export&#13;
and production for domestic markets. The value of all subsidies granted&#13;
to the manufacturing industry in 1981 was TL 50,506.1 million, equal to&#13;
8.8 percent of the total  manufacturing  production.   This  is equally&#13;
divided between production for export and domestic markets.   The value&#13;
of  all  export  subsidies  is  a  substantial  67.8  percent  of  total&#13;
manufacturing exports. 1/  It was mainly these generous subsidies that&#13;
generated the 131.7 percent growth rate of manufactured exports in 1981&#13;
and the 55.0 percent growth rate in 1982.&#13;
The interest subsidy granted to production for the domestic&#13;
market is the most important single subsidy category and constitutes&#13;
48.3  percent  of  the  total  value  of  subsidies.    It is  followed  in&#13;
importance by the export tax rebate (21.0 percent), duty exemptions&#13;
(17.9), the corporation tax reduction on export sales (7.0), the&#13;
1/ Note that this 67.8 percent is not the nominal output protection on&#13;
export sales.  The nominal protection on export sales includes only&#13;
net export tax rebate and is discussed in the next chapter.&#13;

- 52 -&#13;
corporation tax subsidy for SEEs (6.1), investment allowances (5.5), and&#13;
the interest subsidy on export credits (4.1).   The tax element on non-&#13;
preferential credit used in non-export activities is 9.9 percent of the&#13;
value of all subsidies.&#13;
These  subsidies  for  export  plus  domestic  production  are&#13;
unequally distributed between public and private sectors. 76.7 percent&#13;
of all subsidies goes to the public sector, for 13.5 percent of the&#13;
total production in that sector. Only 23.3 percent of the subsidies are&#13;
granted to the private sector, for 4.1 percent of that sector's total&#13;
production.&#13;
Within the public sector, 75.7 percent of the subsidies are&#13;
given to domestic production and 24.3 percent to export production.&#13;
62.4 percent of total public sector subsidies are in the form of&#13;
interest subsidies used in non-export activities.   The second largest&#13;
subsidy instrument in the public sector is the duty exemption (18.1&#13;
percent of total public sector subsidies).&#13;
In the private sector, the negative subsidy on non-preferential&#13;
credit  is  42.6  percent  of  total  private  sector  subsidies.    This,&#13;
compared with the substantial amount of interest subsidy granted to non-&#13;
export credits in the public sector, indicates the heavy bias against&#13;
the private sector in the distribution of non-export credits.   Export&#13;
subsidies, on the other hand, are so high in the private sector that&#13;
they   provide   positive   incentives   to  private   firms,   even  after&#13;
compensating for the negative interest subsidies on non-preferential&#13;
credits.&#13;
81.2 percent of all subsidies in the private sector are in the&#13;
form  of  export  tax  rebates.    This  is  followed  by  corporation  tax&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
reduction on export sales (19.5 percent), duty exemption (17.1), and&#13;
subsidies on export credits  (16.5).   Small  contributions are made by&#13;
investment allowances (6.2) and the interest subsidy on non-export&#13;
credits (2.1).&#13;
The distribution of subsidies in 1981 among the 14 sectors is&#13;
presented in Table 3.3.  The bulk of the interest subsidy on non-export&#13;
credit in the public sector is granted to food industry (57.2 percent of&#13;
total).   This subsidy was given to four public firms producing dairy&#13;
products,  sugar,  tea,  and  meat  products.    The  other  public  sector&#13;
activities which receive a heavy interest subsidy are wood and paper&#13;
products,  chemicals,  and  iron  and  steel  products.    The  last  two&#13;
activities also receive substantial duty exemptions.&#13;

CHAPTER IV&#13;
THE INCIDENCE OF PROTECTION AND INCENTIVES&#13;
IN TURKISH MANUFACTURING: AGGREGATE RESULTS&#13;
1.   INTRODUCTION&#13;
The incentive and comparative advantage cofficients, estimated&#13;
for 123 firms (19 public and 104 private), were first aggregated into 66&#13;
sectors.   They were then aggregated into 14 sectors and finally into&#13;
total manufacturing.   For each level of aggregation,  the results were&#13;
broken down by ownership (public and private) and by market destination&#13;
(domestic and export).&#13;
The results will be evaluated in two chapters.   This chapter&#13;
aims to provide an overall picture of the protection and comparative&#13;
advantage in Turkish manufacturing, with particular reference to the&#13;
relative incidence of the system of incentives on the public and private&#13;
sectors and on domestic and export  sales.   Sectoral  details will be&#13;
avoided.     The  main  emphasis  of  this  chapter  will  be  on  total&#13;
manufacturing and on the 14-sector aggregation.   Evaluation of the 66-&#13;
sector results will be taken up in the following chapter.&#13;
The sensitivity of the estimated coefficients to prices and the&#13;
difficulty involved in estimating world prices are well known. Although&#13;
maximum care has been given to obtain the best available data, the&#13;
possibility of errors, particularly in estimates of world prices, still&#13;
remains.   The conclusions, therefore, should be taken with caution and&#13;
the reader should be forewarned against drawing facile deductions from&#13;
the evidence presented.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
But  before  these  results  are  presented,  two  points  need&#13;
mentioning.    First,  the  nominal  protection  coefficients  (NPCs)  are&#13;
estimated  through price  comparison:    they  are  not adjusted  for the&#13;
quality differentials between domestic and foreign products.   Quality&#13;
differentials should normally be obtained from the users of the&#13;
products.   But deciding the differentials  involves a high degree of&#13;
personal  judgment  and  therefore  introduces  subjectivity  in  data.&#13;
Besides, it is a highly time-consuming work and would have considerably&#13;
delayed the completion of the project.  It was decided, therefore, that&#13;
the NPCs would be estimated by comparing prices without allowing for&#13;
quality differences.&#13;
Given the lower quality of most of the domestic products, the&#13;
NPCs calculated from price comparisons are underestimated, since the&#13;
observed price differences do not reflect the lower quality of domestic&#13;
products.    One  should  keep  this  underestimation  in mind  when  one&#13;
evaluates the results and drive policy conclusions.   The direction of&#13;
bias in the EPCs, however, is not clear because the extent of quality&#13;
differentials for output and inputs are not known.&#13;
Second, the evaluation of the incentive coefficients (NPCs,&#13;
EPCs, and ESCs) in this and the following chapters pertains mainly to&#13;
unadjusted (gross) coefficients obtained under the current exchange rate&#13;
rather than to the adjusted (net) coefficients that would prevail under&#13;
the  hypothetical   free  trade  conditions.         Comparative  advantage&#13;
coefficients (DRCs and SPCs), in contrast, are presented on a net basis.&#13;
To allow comparison, the incentive coefficients are also&#13;
adjusted for the overvaluation of the exchange rate and presented&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
separately. Adjustment is made by expressing the world market prices in&#13;
terms of domestic currency at the exchange rate that would prevail under&#13;
free trade conditions.&#13;
This adjustment is necessary, because protection and exchange&#13;
rates are interrelated.   Protection makes it possible to maintain a&#13;
balance of payments equilibrium at a lower exchange rate than the rate&#13;
that would have existed under free trade.   But the lower the exchange&#13;
rate, the lower will be the border prices in domestic currency, and&#13;
hence the NPCs provided by tariffs and QRs.  It is necessary, therefore,&#13;
to eliminate the existing  upward bias  in the incentive coefficients&#13;
estimated  under  the  current  exchange  rate.          The  net  incentive&#13;
coefficients are presented in Table 4.2 and briefly discussed in the&#13;
text.&#13;
One should note that the relative protection of one sector or&#13;
one market does not change whether the overvaluation is accounted for or&#13;
not.&#13;
2.   GENERAL PATTERN OF NOMINAL PROTECTION&#13;
The NPC expresses the effect of protective measures on the&#13;
price received by a domestic  producer for a particular product.   It&#13;
equals the ratio of the domestic producer price to the world market&#13;
price.&#13;
The NPCs on domestic sales and domestically produced inputs are&#13;
calculated through a direct comparison of the domestic producer prices&#13;
and the c.i.f import prices of equivalent products.   The NPC on export&#13;
sales is one plus the net export tax rebate.   For imported inputs the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
NPC equals one plus the ad valorem rate of tariff.  In the case of duty-&#13;
free imports the input NPC is one.&#13;
Output Protection on Total Sales&#13;
Columns 7, 8, and 9 of Table 4.1 present the NPCs on output for&#13;
total manufacturing and for the 14-sector aggregation, which are broken&#13;
down by ownership and market destination.&#13;
Disregarding  the  quality  differentials,  the  NPC  for  total&#13;
manufacturing is estimated at 1.32. This is an average of both domestic&#13;
and export sales, and both public and private sectors. This coefficient&#13;
indicates that manufacturing output as a whole enjoys a positive&#13;
protection of 32 percent under the official exchange rate.  The degree&#13;
of  protection   is  underestimated,   however,  because   the  quality&#13;
differentials between domestic and foreign products are not considered.&#13;
The degree of protection varies over sub-sectors, the highest&#13;
being 1.53 for rubber and plastics and non-ferrous metals.   The lowest&#13;
NPC on output among the 14 sectors is 1.05, for measuring equipment.&#13;
For rubber and plastics, non-ferrous metals, and transport&#13;
equipment, the NPCs are higher than 1.50. The NPCs of seven sectors are&#13;
between  1.25 and 1.49:    leather products,  wood and paper  products,&#13;
chemicals,  iron  and  steel  products,  metal  products,  machinery,  and&#13;
electrical machinery.   Only for food, textiles, cement and glass, and&#13;
measuring equipment are the output NPCs as low as 1.00 to 1.24.  Thus,&#13;
in 10 sectors out of 14 sectors the NPCs exceed 1.24.   These are thie&#13;
basic  intermediate ar,d capital  goods producing sectors.   High output&#13;
protection ini these sectors is certainly detrimental, particularly to&#13;
&#13;

the expansion of exports, since these sectors' outputs are used as&#13;
inputs into others and therefore increase their costs.   This point will&#13;
be taken up later.&#13;
The coefficients presented so far are the averages of public&#13;
and private sectors and conceal the wide variations between and within&#13;
these sectors.&#13;
Output Protection in Public and Private Sectors&#13;
The NPCs for total manufacturing in the public and private&#13;
sectors are 1.25 and 1.39, respectively.   This means that, on average,&#13;
output protection favors the private sector. 1/&#13;
This is an expected outcome.   Although controls on SEE prices&#13;
of traded goods were abolished in 1980 with the exception made in a few&#13;
cases, such as cement, which is applied to prices charged by private&#13;
producers as well, SEEs do not take full advantage of market conditions&#13;
in setting their selling prices on the basis of political, social and&#13;
economic considerations.   Such constraints do not exist for the private&#13;
sector.   This puts the private sector at an advantage with regard to&#13;
output protection.&#13;
There are considerable variations also within the public and&#13;
private sectors.   No public firms are included in the sample in rubber&#13;
and  plastics,  metal   products,  machinery,   transport  equipment,  or&#13;
measuring equipment sectors.   In the remainiriq nine sectors,  there are&#13;
no cases in the public sector where the NPCs are as high as 1.75. There&#13;
are two such cases in the private sector.&#13;
1/ Part of this difference is due to product differentiation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
The NPCs on total sales of public and private sectors are not&#13;
significantly different in the case of textiles, wood and paper&#13;
products, and iron and steel products; they are 1.24 and 1.23, 1.50 and&#13;
1.43, and 1.48 and 1.43, respectively.&#13;
In leather products the NPCs for public and private firms are&#13;
1.51 and 1.12, respectively.   This difference can be traced to firms 35&#13;
and 36 (Table C.1 in Annex C).  Firm 35 is a public firm and firm 36 is&#13;
a  private  firm,  both  producing  footwear.    A  comparison  of  the&#13;
capital/labor and output/labor ratios of these two firms indicates that&#13;
the public firm is inefficient and has higher costs than the private&#13;
firm.   As Table D.1 in Annex D indicates, although the capital/labor&#13;
ratio is 90 percent higher in the public firm, the output/labor ratio is&#13;
40 percent lower.&#13;
There are price controls orI cement, which apply to public as&#13;
well as private producers.   Therefore, public and private NPCs are very&#13;
close:     and  less  than  one  (.83  and  .87),  indicating  negative&#13;
protection.   However, the NPC on glass, which is produced only in the&#13;
private sector, is high (1.27).  Therefore, it is the NPC on glass that&#13;
widens the difference between public and private NPCs in the case of&#13;
cement and glass (.83 and 1.22).&#13;
In electrical machinery the NPCs are 1.09 for public and 1.87&#13;
for private  firms.    The  only public  firm in this  sector is a very&#13;
efficient firm that produces telephone machines.  The private firms, on&#13;
the other hand, produce diesel engines, TV sets, and electrical&#13;
appliances.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
In the case of food, chemicals, and non-ferrous metals, the&#13;
NPCs for public and private sectors are 1.08 and 1.15, 1.49 and 1.31,&#13;
and 1.33 and 1.75,  respectively.   The differences in these cases are&#13;
explained by product differentiation rather than price differentials in&#13;
the same products.&#13;
The output protection we have been discussing so far has&#13;
pertained to public and private firms and to an average of both.   We&#13;
have been evaluating nominal protection on total sales by ownership and&#13;
by industrial sectors, ignoring the wide variations in output protection&#13;
in domestic  and export markets.   We will  turn  now to the relative&#13;
protection granted to domestic and export sales.&#13;
Output Protection on Domestic and Export Sales&#13;
The   NPCs   on  export  and  on  domestic   sales  for  total&#13;
manufacturing are 1.07 and 1.34, respectively, indicating substantial&#13;
discrimination against exports.  Moreover, the degree of discrimination&#13;
-- 27 percentage points -- is underestimated, since the quality of&#13;
products produced for the domestic market is usually lower than the&#13;
quality of export products.&#13;
The degree of discrimination varies over the 14 sectors, the&#13;
highest being the 52 percentage points observed for non-ferrous metals,&#13;
followed by transport equipment (48 percentage points), wood and paper&#13;
products (45), rubber and plastics (45), chemicals (39), iron and steel&#13;
products (37), machinery (35), leather products (28), textiles (26), and&#13;
food (4).&#13;
Only in the case of cement (public), electrical machinery&#13;
(public) and measuring equipment (private), do the export NPCs exceed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
the domestic market NPCs.   In cement, the difference is due to price&#13;
controls on domestic sales and a 10 piercent tax rebate granted to export&#13;
sales.&#13;
Cement, however, is only part of cement and glass sector.  In&#13;
glass, which is produced in the private sector only, the domestic market&#13;
NPC exceeds the export NPC by 29 percentage points (1.36 and 1.07).&#13;
This brings the domestic sales into a favorable position in terms of&#13;
output protection in the case of cement and glass as a sector.&#13;
In electrical machinery it is only in the public sector that&#13;
the NPC on export sales marginally exceeds the NPC on domestic sales&#13;
(1.12 and 1.09).   This might be explained mainly by the fact that in&#13;
their pricing policies public firms do not, in general, fully exploit&#13;
the high protection on domestic sales provided by tariffs and QRs.  The&#13;
difference might also be due to quality differentials between the&#13;
products produced for export and for domestic markets.   In the private&#13;
sector, the NPC on domestic sales, however, exceeds the NPC on exports&#13;
by a margin of 75 percentage points (1.87 and 1.12). This outweighs the&#13;
NPCs in the public sector and puts the domestic market in a favorable&#13;
position over the export market (1.44 and 1.12).&#13;
In measuring equipment the NPC on exports is only marginally&#13;
higher than the NPC on domestic sales (1.11 and 1.05).  This difference&#13;
would probably be eliminated if the quality differentials are accounted&#13;
for.&#13;
On the basis of the evidence presented, it is therefore safe to&#13;
conclude that there is a large systematic bias against exports with&#13;
regard  to  output  protection  in  almost  all  sectors  in  the  Turkish&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
manufacturing  industry.       It  seems  that  export  tax  rebate  scheme&#13;
compensates for only a fraction of the bias against exports and in favor&#13;
of the home market provided by the import protection from high tariff&#13;
rates and QRs.   As will  be seen later in this chapter,  this bias is&#13;
somewhat reduced by the generous tax and interest subsidies granted to&#13;
industrial exporters.&#13;
Input Protection on Total Sales&#13;
Traded inputs in Turkish manufacturing also enjoy positive&#13;
protection.   Disregarding quality differentials, the NPC on inputs for&#13;
total manufacturing is estimated to be 1.20 which is lower than the NPC&#13;
on the outputs  (1.32).   This implies that there is an escalation  in&#13;
protection in Turkish manufacturing when one goes from inputs to&#13;
outputs.    However,  inputs  enjoy  higher  protection  than  outputs  in&#13;
textiles,   cement   and  glass,   electrical   machinery  and  measuring&#13;
equipment, indicating reverse escalation.&#13;
There is considerable variation in input NPCs among the 14&#13;
sectors, the highest being 1.60, estimated in the case of cement and&#13;
glass, followed by electrical machinery (1.59), non-ferrous metals&#13;
(1.45), machinery (1.42), and wood and paper products (1.42), transport&#13;
equipment (1.40), measuring equipment (1.38), rubber and plastics&#13;
(1.34), textiles (1.26), metal products (1.22), leather products (1.21),&#13;
chemicals (1.08), and iron and steel products (1.08), and finally by&#13;
food  (1.06).   Nine out of the 14 sectors have input NPCs higher than&#13;
1.25 on total sales.&#13;
When these aggregate NPCs are broken down by ownership and by&#13;
market destination, one observes high variations in NPCs between and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
within public and private sectors as well as between and within domestic&#13;
and export markets.&#13;
Input Protection in Private and Public Sectors&#13;
Broken down by ownership, the NPCs on inputs for total&#13;
manufacturing are 1.08 and 1.30 for the public and private sectors,&#13;
respectively, which are lower than the output NPCs in both sectors (1.25&#13;
and 1.39).   This implies that,  on average,  escalation exists in both&#13;
sectors. There is reverse escalation, however, in cement and electrical&#13;
machinery in the public sector, and in textiles, wood and paper&#13;
products, cement and glass, and measuring equipment in the private&#13;
sector.&#13;
Four out of nine, and nine cut of 14 sectors have NPCs higher&#13;
than 1.25 in the public and private sectors, respectively.&#13;
For total manufacturing, both output and input NPCs in the&#13;
private sector (1.39 and 1.30) exceed the corresponding output and input&#13;
NPCs in the public sector (1.25 and 1.08).   But the difference between&#13;
output and input NPCs is wider in the public sector.   The excess of&#13;
output over input NPCs are 17 percent in the public sector and 9 percent&#13;
in the private sector. This means that, although public sector receives&#13;
less protection on its output than the private sector, the situation is&#13;
reversed in traded inputs.&#13;
The advantage of the public over the private sector with regard&#13;
to input protection is due to two major factors.   First,  some of the&#13;
SEEs are allowed to obtain their imported inputs duty-free, even those&#13;
products are sold in the domestic market.   Second, the main inputs in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
certain  SEEs are  agricultural  products,  which  are  subject to price&#13;
controls, and agricultural prices were kept particularly low in 1981 as&#13;
part of the anti-inflationary policies.&#13;
Input Protection in Domestic and Export Sales&#13;
The input NPC on export sales for total manufacturing (1.17) is&#13;
less than the input NPC on domestic sales (1.20), because part of the&#13;
inputs used in export production are obtained duty-free.&#13;
The narrow margin (3 percent) is due to two factors.   First,&#13;
duty-free access is not extended to all inputs in export production.&#13;
The foreign exchange allocation to exporters cannot exceed 60 percent of&#13;
the f.o.b. value of the export pledge. Besides, this allocation is used&#13;
not only for duty-free importation of raw, intermediate, and packing&#13;
materials, but also for duty-inclusive equipment as well.   Therefore,&#13;
only part of inputs used in export production is obtained duty-free.&#13;
Under these circumstances, the input NPC on export sales are calculated&#13;
as  the  weighted  average  of  the  duty-free  imports  (NPC=1)  and&#13;
domestically produced inputs (NPC &gt; 1).  It is the protection accorded&#13;
to domestically produced inputs that makes the input NPC on export sales&#13;
higher than one.&#13;
Second, public firms have the privilege of importing their&#13;
inputs duty-free even if the production is for the domestic market, with&#13;
the exception of two firms in the sample (one in textiles and one in&#13;
non-ferrous metals).   This is why the input NPCs on domestic sales and&#13;
exports are equal  (1.08).   Although  the margin between input NPCs on&#13;
domestic and export sales is 12 percentage points in the private sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
(1.31 and 1.19, respectively), the public sector narrows it down to&#13;
three percentage points.&#13;
Two important points need to be made about the output and input&#13;
NPCs on export sales. First, the output NPC is lower than the input NPC&#13;
(1.07 and 1.17), indicating reverse escalation. By contrast, we observe&#13;
normal escalation in the case of total sales and domestic sales, the&#13;
output and input NPCs being 1.32 and 1.20, and 1.34 and 1.20,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
Second, while the difference between the input NPC and the&#13;
output NPC on export sales is one percentage point in the public sector&#13;
(1.08 and 1.07) in favor of the inpult NPC, it is 12 percentage points in&#13;
the private sector (1.19 and 1.07).   This means that, while the reverse&#13;
escalation is very mild in the public sector, it is relatively sharp in&#13;
the private sector.&#13;
The relationship between output and input protection on export&#13;
sales has important implications for the protection of value added in&#13;
the export market.  This will be taken up in the next section.&#13;
3.   THE GENERAL PATTERN OF EFFECTIVE PROTECTION&#13;
The  nominal  protection  we  have  discussed  in  the  previous&#13;
section expresses the effects of protective measures on the price of a&#13;
particular  product  received  by  its  domestic  producer.           Effective&#13;
protection indicates the combined effect of output and input protection&#13;
on the processing activity.   It is a measure of the protection of value&#13;
added and is superior to nominal protection in describing the structure&#13;
of protection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
The value of effective protection is determined by (a) the&#13;
value of the nominal protection on output, (b) the value of the nominal&#13;
protection on input, and (c) the value-added ratio of the processing&#13;
activity.   The higher the (a) and the lower the (b) and the (c), the&#13;
higher  effective  protection.    Furthermore,  effective  protection  is&#13;
highest in sectors where value added in world prices is negative.&#13;
Effective Protection on Total Sales&#13;
The EPC for total manufacturing is 1.81, substantially higher&#13;
than  the  NPC  on  output  (1.32).    This  is due  to  the  escalation  in&#13;
protection (i.e., the output NPC being higher than the input NPC) and&#13;
implies that, on average, in Turkish manufacturing value added enjoys&#13;
more protection (81 percent)  than output (32 percent).   It is only in&#13;
cement and glass, electrical machinery, and measuring equipment that&#13;
output protection exceeds value added protection. The EPCs and the NPCs&#13;
on output in these sectors are .88 and 1.13, 1.41 and 1.44, and .81 and&#13;
1.05, respectively.&#13;
The dispersion of EPCs over sectors is very wide.   The highest&#13;
is in chemicals (-3.49, indicating negative world value added), followed&#13;
by iron and steel products (6.50), wood and paper products (2.25),&#13;
rubber  and  plastics   (2.25),  non-ferrous  metals  (2.10),  transport&#13;
equipment (1.85), machinery (1.67), leather products (1.62), electrical&#13;
machinery (1.41), metal products (1.32), textiles (1.26), food (1.19),&#13;
cement and glass (.88), and measuring equipment (.81).   Only the last&#13;
two sectors face disprotection of value added; their input NPCs are so&#13;
high (1.60 and 1.38) relative to their output NPCs (1.13 and 1.05) that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
they outweigh the positive output protection.   In chemicals, the EPC in&#13;
the private  sector is  1.80;  quite  high, but positive.   The negative&#13;
world value added in that sector comes from the public sector, whose&#13;
relative weight is very high. The EPCs on total sales exceed 1.25 in 11&#13;
sectors out of the 14.&#13;
Effective Protection in Public and Private Sectors&#13;
The  EPC  on  total  sales  in the  public  sector  (1.97)  is 28&#13;
percentage points higher than the EPC in the private sector (1.69).&#13;
This  result  is of  special  interest.   On average,  while  the private&#13;
sector enjoys higher protection on output, the public sector enjoys&#13;
higher  protection  on  value  added.    This  reflects  the absence  of a&#13;
conscious and systematic policy of industrial protection in Turkey with&#13;
due consideration given to the interactions between input and output&#13;
protection  and  points  the  ad  hoc  and  piecemeal  use  of  protective&#13;
measures.&#13;
The  advantage  of  the  public  sector  with  regard  to  the&#13;
protection of value added comes from the relatively low input protection&#13;
in the public sector because of its privilege of duty-free importation&#13;
of foreign inputs and because of the relatively low agricultural support&#13;
prices granted in 1981. The input NPC in the public sector (1.08) is 17&#13;
percentage points lower than the output NPC (1.25), implying relatively&#13;
sharp escalation.   The same difference  in the private sector is nine&#13;
percentage points (1.30 and 1.39).&#13;
There are considerable variation in the EPCs within the public&#13;
and private  sectors.   In the public  sector,  chemicals  face  negative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
world value added.   The NPC on output in that sector (1.49) exceeds the&#13;
NPC on input (1.00) by 49 percentage points, which yields a negative&#13;
value added  in world prices.   The implication of this negative world&#13;
value added is that this sector would not be viable under world prices&#13;
and only high protection of its output rnakes it profitable.&#13;
After chemicals,  the highest EPC in the public sector is in&#13;
iron and steel products (3.13), followed by wood and paper products&#13;
(.47),  leather  products  (1.86),  non-ferrous  metals  (1.68),  textiles&#13;
(1.37), food (1.13), electrical machinery (1.03), and cement and glass&#13;
(.51). In cement and glass, the disprotection of value added is due to&#13;
government  control  of  cement  prices.         Six  of  the  nine  economic&#13;
activities in the public sector receive an effective protection higher&#13;
than 25 percent.&#13;
Iron and steel products in the private sector ex'nibits negative&#13;
value added at world market prices.   This can be traced back  to two&#13;
firms (firms 80 and 81) among the seven firms surveyed in this sector.&#13;
The output and input NPCs of Firms 80 and 81 are 1.49 and 1.04, and 2.22&#13;
and  1.68,  respectively  (Table 0.1  in Annex  C).   Firm 80 also  faces&#13;
negative value added at domestic prices. This makes the EPC for firm 80&#13;
positive  (.88).   In aggregation  the negative  domestic  value added of&#13;
firm 80 is outweighed by the six other private firms, whereas the&#13;
negative world  value  added  of  firm 80 and 81  is  not.   Firm 80 was&#13;
nationalized in 1982.&#13;
Of the positive EPCs in the private sector, the highest is in&#13;
non-ferrous metals (2.96), followed by electrical machinery (2.27),&#13;
rubber and plastics (2.25), transport equipment (1.85), chemicals&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
(1.80), machinery (1.67), food (1.50), wood and paper products (1.41),&#13;
metal products (1.32), textiles (1.21), leather products (1.15), cement&#13;
and glass (.98), and measuring equipment (.81).   Thus the EPCs in 10&#13;
economic activities out of the 14 exceeds 1.25 in the private sector.&#13;
Figures 4.1 and 4.2 show the output NPCs, input NPCs, and EPCs&#13;
for the public and private sectors.&#13;
Effective Protection on Domestic and Export Sales&#13;
The EPC on export sales for total manufacturing is .94.  This&#13;
is not only lower than the EPC on domestic sales (1.93), exhibiting a&#13;
heavy bias against exports, but also is less than one, implying negative&#13;
protection on export sales. 1/   The negative protection is created by&#13;
the fact that the input NPC on exports (1.17) exceeds the low output NPC&#13;
(1.07)  by  10  percentage  points.   Pis will  be  remembered, duty-free&#13;
importation  is not allowed  for all inputs used  in export production.&#13;
Some inputs are domestically  produced under protection.   The weighted&#13;
average of the two is then higher than one.&#13;
To eliminate the disprotection of export sales and reduce the&#13;
heavy bias against exports, it seems essential to reduce the nominal&#13;
protection on domestically produced inputs or to extend duty-free access&#13;
to all inputs used in export production&#13;
As will be  seen  in  the  next section,  the  disprotection  is&#13;
eliminated and the bias against exports is marginally reduced once the&#13;
1/ One should note that the negative protection on export sales is&#13;
underestimated  here,  since  adjustment  needs  to  be made  for the&#13;
overvaluation of the exchange rate. As Table 4.2 indicates, the net&#13;
EPC on export sales for total manufacturing is .83.&#13;

interest subsidies and tax allowances granted to exporters are factored&#13;
in.&#13;
With the exception of measuring equipment, the bias against&#13;
exports exists in all sectors, the highest being in chemicals, where&#13;
there is a negative EPC on domestic sales. This is followed by wood and&#13;
paper products (155 percentage points), rubber and plastics (153), non-&#13;
ferrous metals (132), iron and steel products (117), transport equipment&#13;
(113), machinery (69), leather products (61), electrical machinery (38),&#13;
textiles (36), metal products (33), food (12), and cement and glass&#13;
(4).     In  measuring  equipment  there  is  a  5  percentage   point&#13;
discrimination in favor of exports.&#13;
Bias against exports, defined as EPC on domestic sales over EPC&#13;
on export sales, is shown in Figure 4.3.&#13;
In seven sectors out of the 14, the NPCs on export sales are&#13;
higher than one (but lower than the NPCs on domestic sales), indicating&#13;
positive protection on export sales.   These sectors (and their NPCs on&#13;
domestic and export sales) are food (1.20 and 1.08), leather products&#13;
(1.68 and 1.07), iron and steel products (6.49 and 5.32), non-ferrous&#13;
metals (2.33 and 1.01), metal products (1.34 and 1.01), machinery (1.75&#13;
and 1.06), and electrical machinery (1.42 and 1.04).&#13;
Considering the emphasis put on export promotion since 1980,&#13;
the discrimination against exports cannot be considered the result of&#13;
deliberate  decisions.    Rather,  it  reflects  the  fact  that,  in  the&#13;
imposition of the protective measures, the interdependence of various&#13;
instruments and their net effect on different market destinations and&#13;
sectors do not receive due considerations.&#13;

Broken down by ownership, the EPC on export sales in the public&#13;
sector is 1..04, higher than that in the private sector (.92), owing to&#13;
the advantage of the public sector in input protection discussed in the&#13;
previous section. Besides, the estimated coefficients indicate positive&#13;
protection in the public sector but negative protection in the private&#13;
sector.&#13;
In the public sector, in six cases out of the nine the EPCs on&#13;
exports are higher than one.   The same situation exists in five cases&#13;
out of the 14 in the private sector.   These are food (1.04), textiles&#13;
(1.02),  chemicals  (1.12),  iron  and  steel  (1.53),  non-ferrous  metals&#13;
(1.11) and electrical machinery (1.06) in the public sector, and food&#13;
(1.13), leather products (1.07), iron and steel products (2.87), metal&#13;
products (1.01), and machinery (1.06) in the private sector.&#13;
4. THE GENERAL PATTERN OF EFFECTIVE SUBSIDY&#13;
The ESC expresses the combined effects of protective measures,&#13;
credit and tax preferences on value added.   It is derived by adjusting&#13;
the EPC for the difference between profit taxes and the interest&#13;
actually paid by the firm and the "normal" profit tax and interest cost.&#13;
In addition to the protection on their output and inputs, the&#13;
subsidies the firms obtained through the following incentive measures&#13;
were also taken into consideration in the estimation of the ESCs. These&#13;
measures were discussed in Chapter II and will be stated here briefly.&#13;
(a) Preferential medium-term credit: subsidized credit is given to&#13;
investment projects in the priority areas designated in annual&#13;
programs.   The subsidy element varies according to the region&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
and  the  sector.    The  difference  between  the  interest  rate&#13;
actually paid by the firms and the normal rate of 38 percent is&#13;
taken to be the subsidy rate.&#13;
(b)  Negative incentive on non-preferential  credit:   there are two&#13;
tax elements (transaction tax and contribution to interest rate&#13;
rebate fund) on non-preferential borrowing in addition to the&#13;
basic rates of 36 and 38 percent for short-term and medium-term&#13;
credits, respectively, both 15 percent of the basic rates. The&#13;
amount of the tax element is calculated for each firm and&#13;
treated as a negative subsidy. These tax elements do not apply&#13;
to  public  firms  when  they  borrow  from  public  financial&#13;
institutions. They pay only a 5.7 percent transaction tax when&#13;
they borrow from private banks.   In the latter case, they also&#13;
receive a 5.0 percent subsidy from the interest rate rebate&#13;
fund, which brings the negative subsidy to 0.7 percent.&#13;
(c)  Tax  allowances:    firms  receive  income  and  corporation  tax&#13;
allowances  for  their  investment  in  the  specified  areas&#13;
indicated  in annual  programs.    The amount  of the allowance&#13;
depends on the region and the sector, as reported by the firms&#13;
in the questionnaire.&#13;
(d)  Preferential  credit  to  exports:    industrial  exporters  have&#13;
access to subsidized credit.   The subsidy element in 1981 is&#13;
calculated at 17.3 percent of the credit.&#13;
(e)  Tax allowances  in exports:   industrial  exporters with annual&#13;
export revenue in excess of $250 thousand are allowed to deduct&#13;
20 percent of their annual export revenue from their taxable&#13;
income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
(f)  Additional   incentives  to  SEEs:       the  incentives  we  have&#13;
considered so far are given to all firms, public or private.&#13;
The following two incentives are granted to SEEs only. First,&#13;
the corporation tax rate is 35 percent for SEEs, as compared to&#13;
40 percent for private firms.   Second,  SEEs  have access  to&#13;
subsidized credit from public financial institutions even for&#13;
use other than indicated in (a).  The interest rates on these&#13;
credits range from 10 percent on Central Bank credits to 21.5&#13;
percent on State Investment Bank credits.&#13;
The types of incentives obtained were reported by the firms.&#13;
This information was used to derive the relevant ESCs.&#13;
Effective Subsidy for Total Sales&#13;
The ESC for total manufacturing is 2.09, higher than the EPC&#13;
(1.81).    This  implies  that  on  top  of  the  high  import  protection,&#13;
manufacturing value added receives positive incentives in the form of&#13;
interest subsidies and tax allowances.&#13;
For leather products, chemicals, rubber and plastics, metal&#13;
products, machinery, and electrical machinery, the ESCs are marginally&#13;
lower than the EPCs.   In these sectors,  the negative subsidy in the&#13;
private sector (the tax element on interest cost) outweighs the positive&#13;
subsidies. In the remaining eight sectors the highest subsidy rate (the&#13;
excess of ESC over EPC) is in iron and steel products (106 percentage&#13;
points), followed by wood and paper products (66), food (55), non-&#13;
ferrous metals (20), cement and glass (9), textiles (3), and transport&#13;
equipment (2). For measuring equipment, the ESC is equal to EPC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
Effective Subsidy in Public and Private Sectors&#13;
The ESC for total manufacturing in the public sector is 2.63,&#13;
66 percentage points higher than the EPC (1.97), indicating that a&#13;
substantial amount of tax and interest subsidies are granted to public&#13;
firms in addition to the very high llevel of protection on value added.&#13;
The ESC in the private sector, on the other hand, is 1.70, only one&#13;
percentage point higher than the EPC (1.69), indicating substantial&#13;
discrimination against the private sector in the distribution of&#13;
subsidies.&#13;
The tax element on non-preferential credit in the private&#13;
sector almost eliminates the positive tax and interest subsidies.   In&#13;
the public sector, on the other hand, the negative subsidy is negligibie&#13;
and the generous subsidies on the credits from the public financial&#13;
institutions and the 5 percent advantage in corporation tax over the&#13;
private sector create a substantial positive subsidy.&#13;
The privileged access of the public firms to scarce credit&#13;
sources imposes a burden on non-preferential credit to the private&#13;
sector and its continuation in addition to the high level of protection&#13;
on value added seems questionable.&#13;
In all sectors the public firms receive a positive subsidy, the&#13;
highest being the 81 percentage points over the EPC for wood and paper&#13;
products,  followed  by  food  (65  percentage  points),  iron  and  steel&#13;
products (49), non-ferrous metals (30), chemicals (19), textiles (8),&#13;
cement and glass (5), electrical machinery (2), and leather products&#13;
(1). The high subsidy rate for food is due to the Central Bank credits&#13;
to the sugar, tea, and meat producing public firms at a 10 percent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
interest rate, used to buy sugar beets, tea leaves, and livestock at&#13;
supported prices.&#13;
In the private sector the net subsidy is negative in eight&#13;
cases: electrical machinery (12 percentage points over the EPC), rubber&#13;
and plastics (9), non-ferrous metals (6), chemicals (4), metal products&#13;
(3), leather products (2), machinery (2), and transport equipment (2).&#13;
Net positive subsidy is estimated only for cement and glass (10), wood&#13;
and paper products (8), food (7), textiles (1), and iron and steel&#13;
products (1).&#13;
The anti-private sector bias, defined as EPC (Pu)/EPC (Pr) and&#13;
ESC  (Pu)/ESC;(Pr),  is  shown  in Figure 4.4.   Bias against the private&#13;
sector exists in total manufacturing in terms of both the effective&#13;
protection and the effective subsidy, the latter being higher. But the&#13;
total results conceal the considerable variation among sectors. Broken&#13;
down by sectors, the bias turns in favor of the private sector in five&#13;
out of nine cases:   food, cement and glass,  iron and steel  products,&#13;
non-ferrous metals, and electrical machinery. The bias in favor of the&#13;
private sector is highest for iron and steel products where a negative&#13;
world value added is estimated. When measured in terms of the effective&#13;
subsidy, the bias turns in favor of the public sector for food, and the&#13;
number of sectors indicating bias in the private sector's favor is&#13;
reduced to four.&#13;
Effective Subsidy on Domestic and Export Sales&#13;
The ESCs on domestic and export sales are 2.19 and 1.37, higher&#13;
than the corresponding EPCs (1.93 and .94) by 26 and 43 percentage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

points,   respectively.       The  generous  interest  subsidies  and  tax&#13;
allowances granted to export sales made the negative protection on value&#13;
added positive by a margin of 37 percent.   But this was not sufficient&#13;
to eliminate the substantial discrimination against exports, indicated&#13;
by the 82 percentage point difference between the ESCs on domestic and&#13;
export sales (2.19 and 1.37, respectively).&#13;
As can be seen in Figure 4.3, the anti-export bias, defined as&#13;
EPC(D)/EPC(E) and ESC(D)/ESC(E), varies among sectors, the highest being&#13;
in chemicals, wood and paper products, rubber and plastics, non-ferrous&#13;
metals, and transport equipment.   Only for measuring equipment is the&#13;
bias in favor of export sales (when the bias is measured in terms of&#13;
effective protection).   The generous export subsidies moderately reduce&#13;
the overall anti-export bias, and turns the bias in exports' favor in&#13;
food, cement and glass, metal products, and electrical machinery.   The&#13;
effect of export subsidies is most marked in reversing or reducing the&#13;
bias  in  electrical   machinery,   non-ferrous  metals,   and  transport&#13;
equipment.&#13;
It is important to note that the positive subsidy estimated for&#13;
total manufacturing on domestic sales comes entirely from the public&#13;
sector.   The net subsidy on domestic  sales  in the private sector is&#13;
negative.   As Table 4.1 indicates, while the ESC on domestic sales in&#13;
the public sector for total manufacturing (2.66) is higher than the EPC&#13;
(2.02), it is lower in the private sector (1.79 and 1.86).  This result&#13;
is of special interest. The negative subsidy created by the tax element&#13;
attached to the interest cost is so high in the private sector in the&#13;
case of domestic sales that it outweighs all positive subsidies granted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 5 -&#13;
to the private sector.  This negative subsidy on domestic sales becomes&#13;
marginally positive, however, when positive export subsidies are taken&#13;
into consideration.&#13;
In all sectors except cement and glass and wood and paper&#13;
products, the net subsidy on domestic sales is negative in the private&#13;
sector, whereas it is positive in all sectors in the public sector.&#13;
5. NET INCENTIVE COEFFICIENTS&#13;
The NPCs, EPCs, and ESCs that we have been evaluating are all&#13;
gross coefficients obtained under the current exchange rate.   To allow&#13;
comparison,   the  net  coefficients   that  would  prevail   under  the&#13;
hypothetical free trade conditions are presented in Table 4.2.  The net&#13;
coefficients are obtained by adjusting the gross coefficients for the 14&#13;
percent  overvaluation  of  the  exchange   rate  estimated  in  1981.&#13;
Adjustment is made by expressing the world market prices in terms of&#13;
domestic currency at the shadow exchange rate.&#13;
The  adjustment  does  naturally  not  affect  the  relative&#13;
protection of one sector or one market vis-a-vis the others, but reduces&#13;
all coefficients.&#13;
6. DOMESTIC RESOURCE COST ESTIMATES&#13;
The  incentive  coefficients  we  discussed  in  the  previous&#13;
sections  measure  the  level  of  incentives  accorded  to a firm or an&#13;
industry.   The DRC  (and  the SPC,  to be  discussed  in the following&#13;
section), on the other hand, is a measure of costs and benefits; it&#13;
throws some light on the efficiency and the comparative advantage of the&#13;
economic activity.&#13;

The DRC is the ratio of the shadow cost of labor and capital of&#13;
the economic activity to its world value added. It represents the value&#13;
of the domestic resources expended in saving or earning a unit of&#13;
foreign exchange, valued in domestic currency at the shadow exchange&#13;
rate. Ranking activities by the DRC expresses the long-term comparative&#13;
advantages in these production activities.  An economic activity with a&#13;
lower DRC is superior in comparative advantage to one with a higher&#13;
DRC.    In  general,  a  DRC  higher  than  one  indicates  comparative&#13;
disadvantage and a negative DRC signifies a net foreign exchange loss to&#13;
the economy.&#13;
In the DRC and the SPC calculations, firms' fixed assets were&#13;
revalued with the appropriate price indices and the capital cost was&#13;
estimated from the revalued capital.   The revalued capital of the firms&#13;
is 1.2 to 5.8 fold higher than the book value, depending on the age and&#13;
the composition of the fixed assets.  This difference is created by the&#13;
high inflation in the pre-1981 periocl.  Calculations based on the book&#13;
value would have underestimated the DRCs and overestimated the SPCs.&#13;
The DRCs and the SPCs are estimated for both actual and full&#13;
capacity operation of economic activi'ties.  The values of full capacity&#13;
are obtained by multiplying the actual capacity values of all output and&#13;
cost elements by one over the capacity utilization rate, except the cost&#13;
of unskilled and semi-skilled labor, depreciation allowances and the&#13;
value of fixed assets, which are kept constant.&#13;
For total manufacturing, the DRCs at the actual and at the full&#13;
capacity operations are 2.04 and 1.82, respectively. This implies that,&#13;
on average, the cost of domestic resources in Turkish manufacturing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
exceeds the world value added created in these activities by 104 percent&#13;
at actual and 82 percent at full capacity.&#13;
There  is a wide  variation  in DRCs among sectors.   At actual&#13;
capacity, the highest DRC is in chemicals (-10.76, indicating negative&#13;
world value ad[ded), followed by iron and steel products (10.15), wood&#13;
and  paper  products  (4.61),  non-ferrous  metals  (3.64),  food  (1.71),&#13;
rubber and plastics (1.65), leather products (1.63), transport equipment&#13;
(1.38),  machinery   (1.13),  metal  products  (1.01),  textiles  (.93),&#13;
electrical  machinery  (.88),  cement  and  glass  (.58),  and  measuring&#13;
equipment (.50).&#13;
In chemicals, the DRC in the private sector is 1.49; this is&#13;
relatively high, but positive.  The negative world value added is due to&#13;
one public firm that produces petro-chemicals (firm 61). The output NPC&#13;
of this firm (1.53) exceeds the input NPC (.99) by 54 percentage points,&#13;
which turns the value added into negative at world prices (Annex C,&#13;
Table C.1).   Firm 61 is one of the largest public firms and its weight&#13;
in chemicals is so high that it outweighs the remaining 16 firms in that&#13;
sector, 14 of which are private.&#13;
The DRCs on total sales exceed 1.25 in eight of the 14 sectors.&#13;
The full capacity DRCs are lower than the actual capacity DRCs&#13;
in all sectors, the difference depending on the capacity utilization&#13;
rate and the ratio of variable to fixed costs.&#13;
In chemicals, the positive world value added in the private&#13;
sector outweighs the negative world value added in the public sector&#13;
when the firms operate at full capacity and the DRC in chemicals at full&#13;
capacity becomes positive (35.39), the highest of all cases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
The number of sectors having DRCs higher than 1.25 decreases&#13;
from eight to six of the 14 when we switch from actual to full capacity&#13;
operation.&#13;
Domestic Resource Cost in Public and Private Sectors&#13;
Variation   between   the   public   and   private   sectors   is&#13;
considerable.   For total manufacturing, at actual capacity, the DRCs in&#13;
the public and private sectors are 3.76 and 1.63, respectively, implying&#13;
that in both public and private sectors the shadow cost of labor and&#13;
capital exceeds the world value added by a considerable margin, and the&#13;
cost in tie former is more than twice the cost in the latter.&#13;
With the exceptions of iron and steel products and electrical&#13;
machinery, the DRCs are higher in the public sector than in the private&#13;
(Figure 4.5).&#13;
In the public sector, the highest DRC at actual capacity is in&#13;
chemicals (-3.35), followed by wood and paper products (5.41), non-&#13;
ferrous metals (3.89), iron and steel products (3.32), food (2.01),&#13;
leather products (1.97), textiles (.95), electrical machinery (.65), and&#13;
cement and glass  (.60).   Six  sectors out of the nine in the public&#13;
sector have DRCs higher than 1.25.&#13;
The highest DRC in the private sector is for iron and steel&#13;
products (-2.98). This is followed by non-ferrous metals (3.17), rubber&#13;
and  plastics  (1.65),  wood  and  paper  products  (1.60),  electrical&#13;
machinery   (1.40),   chemicals   (1.40),   transport  equipment   (1.38),&#13;
machinery  (1.13),  metal   products  (1.01),  leather  products  (.99),&#13;
textiles (.92), food (.91), cement and glass (.58), and measuring&#13;

equipment (.50).   Seven firms out of the 14 in the private sector have&#13;
DRCs higher than 1.25 at actual capacity.&#13;
At full capacity, the DRCs for total manufacturing in the&#13;
public and private sectors are 2.29 and 1.37, 147 and 26 percentage&#13;
points lower than the corresponding DRCs at the actual capacity,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
The full capacity DRCs are lower than the actual capacity DRCs&#13;
in all cases in both public and private sectors.&#13;
The Relationship Between DRCs and EPCs&#13;
Figure 4.6 shows the relationship between the DRCs at actual&#13;
capacity  and the  net EPCs.   There are wide variations between them&#13;
particularly in the public sector.&#13;
In general, if the shadow and the market prices of labor and&#13;
capital were equal, then the DRCs and the EPCs were also equal. In this&#13;
study, however, the DRCs are expected to be higher than the EPCs, even&#13;
in the case of equal shadow and market prices, since the fixed capital&#13;
is revalued and the capital cost in the DRC calculations is estimated&#13;
from the revalued capital. Part of the excess of the DRCs over the EPCs&#13;
is explained, therefore, by the revaluation of fixed capital. The other&#13;
reason for the differences between the DRCs and the EPCs is the&#13;
deviations of the shadow prices of the primary inputs from their market&#13;
prices.&#13;
Labor is broken down into the following three categories in the&#13;
study:   managers, skilled labor, and unskilled and semi-skilled labor.&#13;
The shadow wages for the first two categories are taken to be equal to&#13;

their actual wages.  But the shadow wage for unskilled and semi-skilled&#13;
labor is assumed to be 20 percent less than the actual wage. The shadow&#13;
return to capital  is taken to be .12.   This is the rate used by the&#13;
State Planning Organization and the Industrial Development Bank of&#13;
Turkey for their project evaluation.&#13;
There is not much difference in labor cost at the shadow and&#13;
the actual wages. Given the effect of the revaluation of fixed capital,&#13;
it is mainly the difference between the shadow and the actual rates of&#13;
return to capital that explains the deviations of the DRCs from the&#13;
EPCs.&#13;
It seems that the wide difference between the shadow and the&#13;
actual rates of return to capital in the public sector (0.120 and&#13;
-0.012) reinforces the effect of revaluation of fixed assets and creates&#13;
a wide difference between the overall DRC (3.76) and the net EPC (1.97)&#13;
in the public  sector.   As indicated in Figure 4.6,  the difference is&#13;
most pronounced in the case of non-ferrous metals, wood and paper&#13;
products, and food.&#13;
In the private sector, the difference between the shadow and&#13;
the actual rates of return is relatively small  (0.120 and 0.074).  This&#13;
largely explains the small difference between the DRC and the net EPC&#13;
for total  manufacturing  (1.63 and  1.69)  in the private sector.   The&#13;
difference  is  relatively  small  in  all  sectors  except  electrical&#13;
machinery, rubber and plastics, and food.&#13;
7.   SOCIAL PROFITABILITY COEFFICIENT ESTIMATES&#13;
The  social   profitability  coefficient   (SPC)  expresses  the&#13;
difference between the shadow values of benefits and costs as a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -&#13;
percentage of the shadow value of total net assets. The shadow value of&#13;
benefits is defined as the value of output at world prices, expressed in&#13;
domestic  currency at the shadow exchange  rate.   The shadow value of&#13;
costs is the sum of:   (1) the shadow value of tradeable intermediate&#13;
inputs, defined as the value of these inputs at the world prices&#13;
expressed in terms of domestic currency at the shadow exchange rate, and&#13;
(2) the shadow value of labor.&#13;
The SPCs provide a ranking of economic activities by a one-&#13;
period rate of return on their capital.&#13;
The SPCs for total manufacturing are 0.015 at actual capacity&#13;
and 0.033 at full capacity operation, substantially lower than the&#13;
shadow rate of return to capital (0.120).&#13;
The intersectoral  variation is very high.   The highest SPC at&#13;
actual capacity is in measuring equipment (0.350), followed by cement&#13;
and glass (0.307), electrical machinery (0.161), textiles (0.138), metal&#13;
products (0.116), machinery (0.095), transport equipment (0.068), rubber&#13;
and plastics (0.037), and food (0.036).   In five sectors the SPCs are&#13;
negative:   leather products (-0.005), non-ferrous metals (-0.011), wood&#13;
and  paper  products  (-0.015),  iron  and  steel  products  (-0.035)  and&#13;
chemicals (-0.041).&#13;
In four sectors out of the 14, the SPCs exceed the shadow rate&#13;
of return to capital (0.120).&#13;
The full capacity SPCs are higher than the actual capacity in&#13;
all sectors. The number of sectors having negative SPCs is reduced from&#13;
five to three, and the number of sectors with SPC higher than 0.120 is&#13;
increased from four to five when we move from the actual to full&#13;
capacity operation.&#13;

Social Profitability in Public and Private Sectors&#13;
The aggregate results conceal the very wide variations in the&#13;
SPCs between the public and private sectors.   For total manufacturing,&#13;
at actual capacity, the SPCs in the public and private sectors are&#13;
-0.007 and 0.062, respectively.   The full capacity SPOs are higher in&#13;
both sectors (0.015 and 0.064).&#13;
With the exception of textiles, iron and steel products, and&#13;
electrical machinery, the SPCs in all cases in the private sector are&#13;
higher  than  in  the  public  sector  (Figure  4.7).    In  textiles  the&#13;
difference is small: 0.140 in the public sector and 0.138 in the private&#13;
sector,  at actual  capacity.   In iron and steel  products,  the private&#13;
sector faces a negative SPC (-0.122), whereas the public sector has a&#13;
low, but positive, SPC (0.002).   The difference is much wider in favor&#13;
of the public sector for electrical machinery (0.333 and 0.046, at&#13;
actual capacity). The unusually high SPC in the public sector is due to&#13;
one very efficient firm (firm 107, Table C.1 in Annex C) producing&#13;
telephone machines.&#13;
For leather products, wood and paper products, chemicals, and&#13;
non-ferrous metals, the SPCs are negative in the public sector, but&#13;
positive in the private sector.&#13;
The variations within the public and the private sectors are&#13;
also very high.   The highest SPC in the public sector is in electrical&#13;
machinery (0.333 at actual and 0.345 at full capacity), followed by&#13;
cement and glass (0.267 and 0.282), textiles (0.140 and 0.167), food&#13;
(0.028 and 0.070), iron and steel products (0.002 and 0.014), non-&#13;
ferrous metals (-0.018 and 0.004), wood and paper products (-0.020 and&#13;

machinery (0.095 and 0.118), chemicals (0.075 and 0.130), transport&#13;
equipment (0.068 and 0.107), wood and paper products (0.054 and 0.064),&#13;
electrical machinery (0.046 and 0.066), rubber and plastics (0.037 and&#13;
0.084),  non-ferrous  metals  (0.004  and  0.049),  and  iron  and  steel&#13;
products (-0.122 and -0.266).&#13;
Only in one sector is the SPC negative in the private sector.&#13;
The SPCs exceed 0.120 in five sectors at actual, and in seven at full&#13;
capacity operation.&#13;
Financial Profitability&#13;
The SPC indicates a one-period rate of return to total capital&#13;
everything expressed in shadow prices. This is contrasted with the rate&#13;
of return to total capital, with all variables measured at their market&#13;
prices (the rate of financial profitability).   The latter is shown in&#13;
the last two columns of Table 4.1.  The rate of financial profitability&#13;
is calculated on both the historical  and the revalued capital.   The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100 -&#13;
revalued capital is estimated by revaluing the historical capital stock&#13;
with  the appropriate  price  indices.   It is necessary to adjust the&#13;
historical capital stock for inflation to correct for distortions in the&#13;
financial accounts of firms due to high inflation in previous years and&#13;
to eliminate the overestimation of the rate of financial profitability&#13;
based on the book value of the fixed assets.&#13;
The difference between the two rates of financial profitability&#13;
is very wide, the rate on the revalued capital being substantially lower&#13;
than that on the historical capital, as is to be expected.   For total&#13;
manufacturing, the rates are 0.100 on the historical capital and 0.014&#13;
on the revalued capital.   Owing to the higher capital  intensity, the&#13;
difference  is wider in the public  sector.   The rates are 0.056 and&#13;
-0.012, and 0.200 and 0.074, in the public and private sectors,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
In the public sector, the total return to capital becomes&#13;
negative after revaluation.   In the calculations of the rate of return&#13;
on the revalued assets, the difference between the depreciation on the&#13;
revalued and the historical capital is deducted from the book value of&#13;
total return to capital.   It seems that the difference between the two&#13;
values of depreciation outweighs the book value of the total return to&#13;
capital and makes it turn negative in the public sector.&#13;
Wide   differences   between   the   two   rates   of   financial&#13;
profitability occur in all sectors and a negative rate of return on&#13;
revalued capital is estimated in four cases out of the nine in the&#13;
public sector (wood and paper products, chemicals, cement and glass, and&#13;
non-ferrous metals) and in one case out of the 14 in the private sector&#13;
(iron and steel products).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 101 -&#13;
The substantial differentiall between the two rates of financial&#13;
profitability is an indication of distortions in the financial accounts&#13;
of the firms created by the high level of inflation in earlier years.&#13;
Given the lack of inflation accounting, depreciation allowances were&#13;
calculated  at  historical  values,  thereby  taxing  pseudo  profits  and&#13;
creating resource drains from firms.&#13;
To correct this situation, legislation was introduced in 1982&#13;
which allows the revaluation of fixed assets.  Fixed assets can now be&#13;
adjusted for inflation, taking 1972 as the base year, and the surplus on&#13;
revaluation is exempted from the capital gains tax.&#13;
Social Profitability and Private Profitability&#13;
Social    profitability    can   be   compared   with   private&#13;
profitability.   In comparison, the SPC at actual capacity operation is&#13;
used as the measure of social profitability.   Private profitability is&#13;
represented by the rate of return to revalued capital (the last column&#13;
in Table 4.1) and abbreviated as PPC (private profitability coefficient)&#13;
for easy reference.&#13;
Both the SPC and the PPC are one-period rates of return to&#13;
capital. But in the SPC everything is expressed in terms of opportunity&#13;
costs (shadow and world prices).   In the case of the PPC, however, all&#13;
variables  are  valued  at  market  prices.    If  there  were  no  price&#13;
distortions in the economy (opportunity costs = domestic prices) the&#13;
PPCs  would  equal  the  SPCs.    Putting  it differently,  the  degree  of&#13;
divergence between the SPCs and the PPCs reflects the degree of price&#13;
distortions existing in the product and factor markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -&#13;
The SPC and the PPC for total manufacturing are 0.015 and&#13;
0.014, respectively. In view of the wide variations among manufacturing&#13;
activities and between public and private sectors, the small difference&#13;
between the SPC and the PPC for total manufacturing indicates that&#13;
distortions in product and factor markets have influenced the results in&#13;
opposite directions.&#13;
Among the 14 sectors the difference between the SPC and the PPC&#13;
is the widest in cement and glass (0.307 and 0.154), followed by&#13;
measuring equipment (0.350 and 0.201), rubber and plastics (0.037 and&#13;
0.120), electrical machinery (0.161 and 0.216), textiles (0.138 and&#13;
0.101), machinery (0.095 and 0.121), chemicals (-0.041 and -0.015), wood&#13;
and paper products (-0.015 and -0.038), food (0.036 and 0.018), leather&#13;
products  (-0.005  and  0.012),  iron  and  steel  products  (-0.035  and&#13;
-0.024), transport equipment (0.068 and 0.078), non-ferrous metals (-&#13;
0.011 and -0.004), and metal products (0.116 and 0.118).&#13;
Broken down by ownership, the SPC and the PPC for total&#13;
manufacturing are -0.007 and -0.012 in the public sector, and 0.062 and&#13;
0.074 in the private sector, respectively.&#13;
Variations within the public and private sectors are also&#13;
wide.   In the public sector the difference between the SPC and the PPC&#13;
goes up to 30.4 percentage points in cement (0.267 and -0.037).   The&#13;
widest difference in the private sector is 14.9 percentage points, in&#13;
the case of measuring equipment (0.350 and 0.201).&#13;
The divergence between the social and the private profitability&#13;
among manufacturing activities and between the public and private&#13;
sectors indicates the existence of price distortions in the product and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 103 -&#13;
factor markets.   Some of these distortions are policy-imposed; others&#13;
are due to market imperfections.&#13;
Distortions  in  the  product  markets  are  created  by  the&#13;
application of protective measures, market imperfections, and price&#13;
controls and are reflected in the nominal protection coefficients.&#13;
Distortions in the capital markets are due to the government's selective&#13;
credit policies and subsidy schemes as well as market imperfections and&#13;
are reflected in the differences between rates of return on alternative&#13;
investments.&#13;
Achieving convergence between social profitability and private&#13;
profitability requires corrective actions not only in the product&#13;
markets but also in the capital markets.&#13;

CHAPTER V&#13;
THE INCIDENCE OF PROTECTION AND INCENTIVES IN TURKISH MANUFACTURING:&#13;
SOME 66-SECTOR RESULTS&#13;
The aim of this chapter is to evaluate some of the 66-sector&#13;
results.   Tariff and non-tariff protection on output will be discussed&#13;
first.   The frequency distribution of and the relationship between the&#13;
indicators of incentives and comparative advantage will be taken up&#13;
later.&#13;
1.       TARIFF AND NON-TARIFF PROTECTION ON OUTPUT&#13;
Tariff protection, particularly on finished products, is very&#13;
high  in  the  Turkish  manufacturing.    The  average  rate  in  1981  is&#13;
estimated at 49 percent (Table 5.1).   Individual  rates range from zero&#13;
to 216 percent.&#13;
Imports are also subject to QRs. The main purpose of QRs is to&#13;
provide additional protection on domestic sales over and above the&#13;
protection provided by tariffs and tariff-like charges.  In view of the&#13;
wide application of QRs in Turkish manufacturing, nominal protection&#13;
coefficients have been estimated in this study by the direct comparison&#13;
of c.i.f. import prices and domestic ex-factory prices.   The excess of&#13;
domestic prices over c.i.f. import prices is the nominal protection on&#13;
domestic sales accorded by QRs and is referred to as the "implicit&#13;
tariff".&#13;
In   this   section   the   potential  protection   on domestic&#13;
sales provided by tariffs and the actual protection under QRs will be&#13;

compared.  The purpose of this comparison is to see whether tariffs are&#13;
redundant.&#13;
Table 5.1 provides the data lor this comparison. Columns 1 and&#13;
2 present the tariff protection, divided into general and EEC tariffs.&#13;
As will be remembered, imports from the EEC are subject to lower tariffs&#13;
as a part of Turkey's planned integration with the EEC. 1/  Column 3&#13;
indicates the nominal protection on domestic sales, calculated through a&#13;
price comparison (implicit tariff or non-tariff protection); column 4&#13;
shows the difference between non-tariff and tariff protection.  Because&#13;
most part of Turkey's non-oil imports are from the EEC countries, tariff&#13;
rates applicable to imports from the EEC are taken as the norm to&#13;
calculate the difference between non-tariff and tariff protection.&#13;
For total manufacturing the average tariff rate in 1981 is 8&#13;
percentage points higher than the average implicit tariff rate, implying&#13;
tariff redundancy.   This also implies that import controls add nothing&#13;
to the protection provided by the tariff structure.   Both conclusions&#13;
should be treated with caution, however, since the implicit tariffs are&#13;
not adjusted for quality differentials between foreign and domestic&#13;
products.  The situation might have been reversed had the lower quality&#13;
of the domestic products been factored in.  It is necessary, therefore,&#13;
to have an accurate estimate of quality differentials to decide about&#13;
tariff redundancy and the contribution of QRs to import protection.&#13;
1/ See Chapter II for more information on tariff structure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 108 -&#13;
This question arises when legal tariff rates are higher than&#13;
the implicit tariff rates (negative entries in column 4 of Table 5.1),&#13;
as is also the case in the private sector for total manufacturing.&#13;
In the public sector, however, the legal tariff rate is lower&#13;
than the implicit tariff rate. It is not only that tariffs are binding,&#13;
but also that QRs are making a positive contribution of three percentage&#13;
points on top of the protection provided by the tariff structure.  This&#13;
contribution is underestimated, because the quality differentials are&#13;
ignored.&#13;
The difference between non-tariff and tariff protection is very&#13;
wide among the 66 subsectors, ranging from -179 to 129 percentage&#13;
points.   The general  pattern  is that tariffs,  particularly  those on&#13;
finished products, are so high that legal tariff rates exceed the&#13;
implicit  tariff  rates  when  quality  differentials  are  ignored.    As&#13;
indicated in Table 5.2, there are 42 such cases among the 66 sectors.&#13;
Whether the tariffs are redundant in these 42 sectors depends on the&#13;
degree of quality differentials in favor of foreign products, about&#13;
which information is not available.   However, the possibility of having&#13;
quality differentials in favor of foreign products above 100 percentage&#13;
points is very small.   It is safe, therefore, to conclude that at least&#13;
in 11 sectors out of the 42, tariffs and QRs are redundant:   woolen&#13;
textile, woolen fabric, synthetic yarn, knitting mills, wearing apparel&#13;
(leather), wearing apparel, leather, footwear, plastic shoes, metal&#13;
furniture, and metal structures.&#13;
In these 11 sectors the protection available through tariffs&#13;
is very high, but the domestic competition, demand conditions, and the&#13;

price restraints in the public sector prevent the domestic firms from&#13;
taking full advantage of it.  Relaxation of output protection would not&#13;
affect these industries.&#13;
In the remaining 31 of the 42 sectors, quality differentials&#13;
should be estimated to decide whether tairiffs and QRs are redundant.&#13;
In one sector (grain mill products), tariff and non-tariff&#13;
protection are the same (zero percent).&#13;
Tariff rates for intermediate and capital goods are relatively&#13;
low compared with finished products.   For some food products (flour,&#13;
sugar, and tea) the rates are zero. In all these cases, implicit tariff&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 110 -&#13;
rates exceed the legal rates (positive entries in Tables 5.1 and 5.2),&#13;
implying  additional  protection  accorded  by  QRs  over  and  above  the&#13;
protection  provided  by  the  tariff  structure.    Because  the  quality&#13;
differentials were not accounted for, the protective effect of QRs are&#13;
underestimated.   There are 23 such cases among the 66 sectors (Table&#13;
5.2):   sugar,  tea and nuts processing, velvet,  paper products,  basic&#13;
chemicals, insecticides, fertilizer, paints, pharmaceuticals, chemical&#13;
products, petrochemicals, plastic products, iron and steel products,&#13;
copper,  zinc,  diesel  engines,  tractors,  industrial  machines,  sewing&#13;
machines, electrical motors, TV sets, motor parts, and chassis parts.&#13;
2. FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF THE ESTIMATES&#13;
Estimates of the indicators of incentives and comparative&#13;
advantage  for  66  sectors  are  presented  in  Annex  B.   This  section&#13;
provides  a description of their frequency distribution.   Results are&#13;
presented in tabular form for domestic sales (D), export sales (E), and&#13;
total sales (T) as well as for public sector (Pu), private sector (Pr)&#13;
and total (T).&#13;
The 66-sector results are generally in line with the 14-sector&#13;
results discussed above in Chapter IV.   Therefore,  the discussion in&#13;
this section will be brief.&#13;
Nominal protection is high in Turkish manufacturing. In 1981,&#13;
in  35  sectors  out  of  the  66,  the  NPCs  exceed  1.30  (Table  5.3).&#13;
Considering the lower quality of most of the Turkish products relative&#13;
to their foreign   counterparts,  the output   protection   reflected in&#13;
the NPCs is underestimated. For two sectors (grain mill products and&#13;

wearing apparel) the NPC is one, indicating   no protection is provided&#13;
assuming   no quality differentials.   Four sectors face disprotection:&#13;
meat products, dairy products, cement, and plastic shoes. In the first&#13;
three cases, this is due to price controls in the public sector.&#13;
That output protection, on average, favors private sector.&#13;
This is not reflected in the frequency distribution.   The bias against&#13;
exports is evident,  however,  in Table 5.3.   There is no NPC on export&#13;
sales higher than 1.30.   Fifty sectors out of 53 have NPCs on export&#13;
sales in the 1.01-1.30 range.   In three sectors (grain mill products,&#13;
sugar,  and  petrochemicals),  the NPCs  on export sales are one.   Net&#13;
export tax rebate rates range from zero to 16 percent, insufficient to&#13;
compensate the heavy protection on domestic sales provided by high&#13;
tariff rates and QRs.&#13;
Escalation    in   protection   is   reflected   in   frequency&#13;
distribution.    The  number  of  sectors  appearing  in  the  upper  ranges&#13;
increases when we move from nominal  to effective protection.   Thirty-&#13;
seven  sectors  out of  the  66  have  EPCs  higher  than  1.30.    In four&#13;
sectors,   there  is  negative  world  value-added:          wooden  furniture&#13;
(private), woodmills (public), petrochemicals (public), and iron and&#13;
steel  products  (private).   In the last two,  value-added  in domestic&#13;
prices is also negative. This makes the EPCs in these sectors positive.&#13;
The discrimination against the private sector in effective&#13;
protection is not seen in frequency distribution.  The advantage of the&#13;
public sector with regard to the protection of value-added comes from&#13;
the relatively low input protection, created by the public sector's&#13;
privilege of duty-free importation of foreign inputs and the relatively&#13;
low agricultural support prices granted in 1981.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 113 -&#13;
Discrimination against exports is more pronounced in effective&#13;
protection.   Thirty-one  sectors out of the 53 face disprotection  on&#13;
export sales.   The EPCs of 19 sectors fall within the 1.01-1.30 range.&#13;
There are only three sectors with EPCs on export sales higher than 1.30.&#13;
Movement from lower to upper ranges occurs when we switch from&#13;
the EPCs to the ESCs, indicating that positive incentives in the form of&#13;
interest subsidies and tax allowances are granted to manufacturing&#13;
industries.   Forty-two sectors have IESCs higher than 1.30, i.e., 63.4&#13;
percent of all sectors.&#13;
The generous subsidies provided for export sales are reflected&#13;
in  the  frequency   distribution.         The  number  of  sectors  facing&#13;
disprotection decreases from 31 to 15 when export subsidies are added to&#13;
effective  protection.    In  addition,  the  number  of  sectors  with  a&#13;
coefficient higher than 1.30 increases from 3 to 21 when we move from&#13;
effective protection to effective subsidy.&#13;
The discrimination against private sector in the distribution&#13;
of interest and tax subsidies is not clearly seen in Table 5.3.  Public&#13;
firms have access to heavily subsidized credits from publicly owned&#13;
financial institutions whereas private firms are subject to transaction&#13;
tax and contributions to IRRF, each 15 percent of the basic interest&#13;
rate. Besides, public firms pay a corporation tax that is 5 percentage&#13;
points less than that for private firms.&#13;
The DRCs in 27 sectors out of the 66 are less than one,&#13;
indicating comparative advantage in these sectors.   In 30 sectors the&#13;
DRCs are higher than 1.30; four of them have negative world value&#13;
added.    The DRCs  are  generally  higher in  the  public  sector.   64.7&#13;
percent of all cases in the public sector have DRCs higher than 1.30.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 114 -&#13;
Such sectors represent 41.0 percent of the private sector.   The DRCs at&#13;
full capacity operation are lower than the DRCs at actual capacity. The&#13;
number of sectors with DRCs less than one increases from 27 to 34 when&#13;
one moves  from actual  to full capacity operation.   And the number of&#13;
sectors having DRCs higher than 1.30 decreases from 30 to nine.&#13;
The frequency of sectors with SPCs higher than 0.12 (shadow&#13;
rate of return to capital) is 28 and 35 out of 66 at the actual and full&#13;
capacity operations, respectively.  Thirteen sectors face negative SPCs&#13;
at actual capacity.  This falls to nine sectors at full capacity.  The&#13;
SPCs in the private sector are generally higher than that in the public&#13;
sector. 13.4 percent of all cases in the public sector have SPCs higher&#13;
than 0.12 at actual  capacity  operations.   Such cases  represent 45.9&#13;
percent of the private sector.   In addition, while 41.1 percent of all&#13;
cases in the public sector have negative SPCs, only 13.1 percent of all&#13;
cases in the public sector do. The SPCs are also generally, superior in&#13;
the private sector at full capacity operation.&#13;
3. RELATIONS AMONG INDICATORS OF INCENTIVE AND COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE&#13;
Table 5.5 shows the rank correlation coefficients between the&#13;
average values of different indicators of incentives and comparative&#13;
advantage for total sales.  The NPC on output is highly correlated with&#13;
the EPC, the ESC and the DRC.   The respective correlation coefficients&#13;
are 0.84, 0.73, and 0.69.   The NPC's correlation with the PPR, the K/L&#13;
ratio,  and  the VA/L  ratio  is somewhat lower;  0.21,  0.39,  and 0.40,&#13;
respectivelyy    The correlation between the NPC and the SPC is very low&#13;
(0.05).&#13;

The ESC is very strongly correlated with the EPC.   The rank&#13;
correlation  coefficient between  them is 0.92.   This high correlation&#13;
reflects the importance of protective measures in the system of&#13;
incentives.&#13;
The correlation between the ESC and the DRC is also very strong&#13;
(0.81).   The causality in this high correlation seems to run both ways,&#13;
depending on the age of firms.   That is, the inefficient firms receive&#13;
high protection and subsidies to survive and the firms receiving high&#13;
protection and subsidies for a long time can afford to be inefficient.&#13;

The high correlation between the DRC and the K/L ratio (0.65)&#13;
indicates that inefficiency is higher in the highly capital-intensive&#13;
sectors.&#13;
As expected, the SPC is negatively correlated with the EPC, the&#13;
ESC, the DRC, and the K/L ratio. But the coefficients are not very high&#13;
(-0.13, -0.34, -0.47, and -0.35, respectively).&#13;

CHAPTER VI&#13;
CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY GUIDELINES&#13;
1.   CONCLUSIONS&#13;
Turkey has erected a complex system of industrial incentives&#13;
since the early 1960s which is characterized by its high, indefinite and&#13;
indiscriminate import protection and heavy bias against exports and&#13;
employment.    Under  this  system and heavy public  sector involvement,&#13;
resources have been channelled into import-substituting manufacturing&#13;
industries.    This,  coupled  with  a  rapid  domestic  demand expansion,&#13;
produced favorable results in the first stage of import substitution.&#13;
During the second stage of import substitution, however, the adverse&#13;
effects of Turkey's system of incentives began to emerge and contributed&#13;
to the downturn in the Turkish economy in the second half of the 1970s.&#13;
In  conjunction  with  a  stabilization  program,   industrial&#13;
incentives have been partially reversed since the early 1980s, to which&#13;
manufacturing  industry has responded favorably.   The incentive system&#13;
needs further restructuring, however, if there is to be a more rational&#13;
allocation of resources and a resumption of stability and growth in the&#13;
Turkish economy.&#13;
This study aims to contribute to this end by estimating and&#13;
evaluating the quantitative indicators of incentives and comparative&#13;
advantage in Turkish manufacturing industries in 1981.   The underlying&#13;
data are from the sample survey of 1,23 firms in 66 sub-sectors.   What&#13;
follows are the major findings of this study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 118 -&#13;
1.   Nominal  protection on output, measured by price comparison, is&#13;
high: 32 percent for total manufacturing. This rate, morever,&#13;
underestimates the actual protection granted to manufacturing&#13;
output through high tariff rates and the complex system of QRs,&#13;
because it is not adjusted for quality differentials between&#13;
foreign  and  domestic  products.    The  variation  in  nominal&#13;
protection among sub-sectors, between public and private firms,&#13;
and between domestic and export markets is also very high.&#13;
2.   Tariff rates are very high for finished products (they are as&#13;
high as 261 percent for plastic goods). These tariff rates are&#13;
higher  than  the  nominal  protection  rates  estimated  through&#13;
price comparison.   There may have been tariff redundancy in 11&#13;
of these 66 sectors, even if quality differentials are taken&#13;
into  consideration.    For  most  intermediate  goods  and  food&#13;
products, tariff rates are low and the nominal protection rates&#13;
estimated by price comparison exceed the tariff rates (in 23&#13;
sectors out of the 66):  the difference between the two rates&#13;
indicates the protective effect of QRs.  Quality differentials&#13;
are   not   factored   in,   so   this   protective   effect   is&#13;
underestimated.&#13;
3.   On  average,  nominal  protection  on  output  is  higher  in  the&#13;
private sector than in the public sector (39 percent vs. 25&#13;
percent, for total manufacturing). This is explained partly by&#13;
product differentiation and partly by the fact that SEEs are&#13;
not free to exploit market conditions fully in setting their&#13;
selling prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 119 -&#13;
4.   There is a substantial  anti--export bias in output protection.&#13;
Nominal protection rates for total manufacturing are 34 percent&#13;
on domestic and 7 percent on export sales. It appears that the&#13;
export tax rebate scheme is not sufficient to compensate for&#13;
the high nominal protection granted to the domestic market&#13;
through  the tariff  structure and QRs.   The generous export&#13;
subsidies in the form of tax and interest preferences, however,&#13;
moderate the anti-export bias on output. Further restructuring&#13;
of the system of incentives is needed to produce equalized&#13;
effective subsidy rates for the two markets.&#13;
5.   On  average,  effective  protection  on  output  is  higher  than&#13;
nominal  protection  (81  percent  vs.  32  percent,  for  total&#13;
manufacturing). This is because input protection is lower than&#13;
the output protection (20 percent vs. 32 percent). In addition,&#13;
the  variation  in  effective  protection  among  sub-sectors,&#13;
between public and private firms, and between domestic and&#13;
export markets is very high.&#13;
6.   Effective  protection,  on  average,  is  higher  in  the  public&#13;
sector than in the private sector (97 percent vs. 69 percent,&#13;
for  total  manufacturing).    This  is  created by  lower  input&#13;
protection in the public sector due to its duty-free access to&#13;
most imported inputs and to the relatively low support prices&#13;
granted in 1981 to agricultural products processed by some of&#13;
the SEEs.   This anti-private--sector bias reflects the absence&#13;
of a conscious and systematic policy of industrial protection&#13;
giving due consideration to the interactions between input and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 120 -&#13;
output  protection;  rather,  Turkey  has  made  an  ad  hoc  and&#13;
piecemeal use of protective measures. This bias also indicates&#13;
that the efficiency is lower in the public sector, which&#13;
therefore has required higher protection on value added.&#13;
7.   There is a larger bias against exports in effective protection&#13;
(the effective protection rate is 93 percent in the domestic&#13;
market and -6 percent in the export market).   In fact, in 31&#13;
sectors out of 53 and in total manufacturing the export market&#13;
faces  disprotection.    Considering  the  emphasis  on  export&#13;
promotion since 1980, the higher discrimination against exports&#13;
in terms of value added seems to have been unintended. Rather,&#13;
it indicates that in the imposition of protective measures in&#13;
Turkey,   the   interdependence   of   the   various   protective&#13;
instruments   and   their   net   effect   on  different  market&#13;
destinations and sectors and the combined effect of output and&#13;
input protection do not receive sufficient attention.&#13;
8.   The anti-export bias in effective protection is larger in the&#13;
private sector than in the public sector. This is explained by&#13;
the lower input protection in the public sector.&#13;
9.   For  total   manufacturing   the  effective   subsidy   rate  is&#13;
substantially higher than the effective protection rate in the&#13;
public sector (163 percent and 97 percent), but it is only&#13;
marginally higher in the private sector (70 and 69 percent).&#13;
The skewed distribution of interest and tax allowances in favor&#13;
of the public sector increases the anti-private sector bias.&#13;
10.  Subsidies  on export  sales  in the form of  interest and tax&#13;
preferences  are  high.    In  fact,  export  subsidies  turn  the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 121 -&#13;
protection   of   value   added   on  export  sales   for  total&#13;
manufacturing from negative to positive (the rates of effective&#13;
protection and subsidy on export sales are -6 and 37 percent,&#13;
respectively).    This  reduces  the  anti-export  bias  from  99&#13;
percentage points to 82 percentage points, which is still very&#13;
large.&#13;
11.  The DRC for total manufacturing at actual capacity operation is&#13;
2.04,   implying   that   the   domestic   resource   cost   under&#13;
protection, on average, is 104 percent higher than that what it&#13;
would have been in the absence of protection. In addition, the&#13;
dispersion in DRCs among sub-sectors and between public and&#13;
private sector is very wide.   The DRCs in 27 sectors of the 66&#13;
are less than one, indicatinc a comparative advantage in these&#13;
sectors.&#13;
12.  The DRCs, on average, are substantially higher in the public&#13;
sector,    indicating   greater   inefficiency.          For   total&#13;
manufacturing the DRCs for the public and private sectors are&#13;
3.76 and 1.63, respectively. In both sectors the full capacity&#13;
DRCs are lower than the actual capacity DRCs.&#13;
13.  Variation between the DRCs and the EPCs is high.   Given the&#13;
effect  of  the  revaluation  of  fixed  capital,  the  difference&#13;
between the shadow and the actual  rate of return to capital&#13;
explains most of the deviation of the DRCs from the EPCs.  The&#13;
deviation is wider in the public sector owing to the wider&#13;
difference between the shadow and the actual rate of return to&#13;
capital in that sector (0.120 and -0.012, respectively).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 122 -&#13;
14.  The SPCs, on average, are substantially higher in the private&#13;
sector.   For  total  manufacturing  the SPC  is -0.007  in the&#13;
public sector and 0.062 in the private sector at actual&#13;
capacity operation.   In addition, variation among sub-sectors&#13;
is very wide (ranging from -0.005 to 0.350).  The full capacity&#13;
SPCs are higher than the actual capacity SPCs.   In the public&#13;
sector for total manufacturing the SPC becomes positive at full&#13;
capacity (0.015).&#13;
15.  Wide  differences  are  calculated  between  social  and  private&#13;
profitability among sub-sectors and between public and private&#13;
firms, indicating price distortions in the product and factor&#13;
markets.  Some of these distortions are policy-imposed; others&#13;
are due to market imperfections.&#13;
2. POLICY GUIDELINES&#13;
Detailed policy papers based on the findings of this study are&#13;
being written  separately.   This  section presents  the general policy&#13;
guidelines  coming  out  of  these  findings.    It  also  indicates  the&#13;
necessary follow-up studies to prepare a quantitative policy program to&#13;
restructure Turkey's incentive system.&#13;
Making allowance for the existence of differential incentives&#13;
on the basis of infant industry and social and political considerations,&#13;
the results indicate that to rationalize production and resource&#13;
allocation there should be a gradual narrowing and eventual elimination&#13;
of the wide  variations  in protection:   (a) among manufacturing  sub-&#13;
sectors; (b) between public and private firms; and (c) between domestic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 123 -&#13;
and export markets.   It is desirable to do this with a pre-announced&#13;
timetable to allow sufficient time for the firms to adjust to the new&#13;
incentive system without much dislocation to the economy.&#13;
To narrow the differences in protection among sub-sectors, QRs&#13;
should be gradually lifted and protection be provided through tariffs&#13;
only. In addition, with the exception of luxury imports, tariffs should&#13;
gradually be reduced (but increased in the case of some food products&#13;
and intermediate inputs) to a target rate.  Setting policies to achieve&#13;
target rates of effective protection and effective subsidy requires&#13;
further work.   The tariff rates on inputs and outputs and the sectoral&#13;
subsidy rates which would generate the desired effective rates can be&#13;
estimated in a follow-up study by iteration.&#13;
Narrowing the differences in effective protection between the&#13;
public and private sectors necessitates reducing the differences between&#13;
them in input protection.    Input protection in the public sector is&#13;
relatively low, placing the public sector in a favorable position vis-a-&#13;
vis the private sector in protecting value-added.   One of the reasons&#13;
for the lower input protection in the public sector is its privilege of&#13;
duty-free importation of foreign inputs even when they are to be used in&#13;
production for the domestic market.   Cessation of this privilege would&#13;
contribute to the equalization of the effective rates in the two&#13;
sectors.&#13;
Large differences in the ESCs between the public and the&#13;
private sectors in favor of the former are due to the additional&#13;
subsidies granted to the public firms and the negative subsidies on non-&#13;
preferential credit given to the private firms.  The transaction tax on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 124 -&#13;
non-preferential credit to the private sector should be eliminated to&#13;
reduce  the  negative  subsidies.    The single most significant subsidy&#13;
element which increases the ESC in the public sector is the heavily&#13;
subsidized credits to public firms from public financial institutions.&#13;
Elimination of this privilege not only would substantially contribute to&#13;
the equalization of the ESCs in the public and private firms, but also&#13;
would put some discipline into the financial operation of the public&#13;
firms.&#13;
It is crucial to eliminate the long-standing anti-export bias&#13;
to attain and maintain stability and growth in the Turkish economy. The&#13;
bias against exports in the effective rates is so large that it cannot&#13;
be eliminated by merely increasing export tax rebates, due to budgetary&#13;
implications.      Rather,  action  should  be  taken  to  lower  import&#13;
protection.&#13;
Duty-free importation of inputs used for export production --&#13;
allowed for only a part of inputs in the private sector under the&#13;
current system -- should be extended  to all  inputs.   Given this,  a&#13;
follow-up study should be done to calculate the required tariff rates on&#13;
inputs and outputs and the required export tax rebate rate and other&#13;
subsidies which would equalize the ESCs on domestic and export sales.&#13;
In addition, export subsidies should be related to value added in&#13;
exports  rather  than  to  export  revenue.  1/    In  parallel  with  the&#13;
reduction in import protection, export subsidies should gradually be&#13;

value added, but implementation was postponed.&#13;

reduced and more emphasis should be given to the exchange rate policy in&#13;
export promotion.&#13;
In the policy design for eliminating the wide differences among&#13;
sub-sectors, between public and private sectors, and between domestic&#13;
and export markets, special care should be taken to set the magnitude&#13;
and the timing of the policy changes  in order:   (a) to avoid major&#13;
dislocations in the economy and achieve a smooth transition; (b) to take&#13;
account of the relationship with the EEC; and (c) to avoid abrupt&#13;
changes in government revenue. Particular consideration should be given&#13;
to the implication of the policy changes on employment and income&#13;
distribution.&#13;
3.   POSTSCRIPT&#13;
Since December 1983 the Turkish Government has introduced a&#13;
series of policies related to the system of incentives and protection.&#13;
These policies represent an important turning point in the process of&#13;
adjustment.  They include:&#13;
1.   A substantial import liberalization.  In value terms, about 80&#13;
percent of the items in Liberalized List II were freed from&#13;
QRs.     The  remaining  20  percent  are  still   subject  to&#13;
licensing.   The new import regime increases the share of free&#13;
imports in total imports from the 18 percent of 1983 to 60&#13;
percent.    In addition,  a  list  of banned  imports  was  also&#13;
introduced   to  replace  the  previous  implicit  "Prohibited&#13;
List".   This list has some 207 items including agricultural&#13;
products, drugs, etc. whose import had also been banned under&#13;
the previous regime.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 126 -&#13;
2.   A restructuring of the tariff system.  The tariff rates for 494&#13;
products  were changed:   more  than 80 percent  of them were&#13;
reduced  considerably.       The  pattern   of  low  rates   for&#13;
intermediate foods and food products but higher rates for&#13;
finished goods was preserved.   In addition, the old levy list&#13;
was extended to 75 products and the levies were substantially&#13;
increased.   This list includes basic consumer durables such as&#13;
cars, TV sets, stereo sets, washers, dryers, and refrigerators.&#13;
3.   A  centralization  of  import  administration.    Under  the  new&#13;
system all authority on matters related to imports (such as&#13;
issuing licenses, shifting items among lists, changing tariffs&#13;
and levy rates, and granting the right to purchase foreign&#13;
exchange), previously dispersed among various ministries and&#13;
the Central Bank, is centralized into a newly formed under-&#13;
secretariat under the Deputy Prime Minister.&#13;
4.   A substantial  liberalization of the foreign exchange regime.&#13;
This includes authorization of commercial banks to set their&#13;
own exchange rate within the 6 percent point spread above or&#13;
below the rate established daily by the Central Bank, freeing&#13;
of restrictions on foreign exchange transactions by Turkish&#13;
nationals, the permission for Turkish nationals to invest up to&#13;
$2 million abroad, and the elimination of travel restrictions.&#13;
5.   Re-emphasizing the role of a flexible exchange rate policy in&#13;
the continued export orientation of the economy.&#13;
6.   Continuation of export subsidies in the form of interest and&#13;
tax allowances.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 127 -&#13;
7.   A gradual  reduction in export tax rebate rates (on April  2,&#13;
1984, by 20 percent, and then in September 1984 by another 25&#13;
percent), to rely more on the exchange rate than on direct&#13;
subsidies in export promotion.&#13;
8.   A reduction  of  the  foreign  exchange  retention  rate from 50&#13;
percent of export earnings to 20 percent. Under the new system&#13;
this incentive is extended to all non-manufacturing exports.&#13;
9.   A reduction in the transaction tax on non-preferential  credit&#13;
to the private sector from 15 percent to 3 percent.&#13;
10. A reaffirmation that SEEs will be free to set their own prices&#13;
with certain exceptions, such as sugar, coal, and fertilizer.&#13;
All these policy changes are in line with the guidelines coming&#13;
out of this study and would contribute to the rationalization of the&#13;
incentive  system  substantially.    The  policy  action  related  to  the&#13;
reduction of tariff rates and export rebate rates, however, deserves&#13;
further discussion.&#13;
In  evaluating  the  resource-pull   effect  of  a  system  of&#13;
incentives, effective rates are superior to nominal rates. In combining&#13;
the protection on outputs and inputs and in incorporating various&#13;
subsidies granted to the firm, effective rates measure the protection&#13;
(and subsidy) extended to value added. What matters for the firm is the&#13;
actual protection (and subsidy) obtained on value added.&#13;
In rationalizing the incentive system one should set target&#13;
effective  rates  to be achieved  in a certain period of time.   Given&#13;
these, rates one can then calculate by iteration the required subsidy&#13;
rates  and  the  tariff  rates  on  outputs  and  inputs.    The  iterative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 128 -&#13;
procedure produces a timetable for the changes in the tariff and subsidy&#13;
rates which would gradually equalize the effective rates among sectors&#13;
and between public and private firms.   To eliminate the anti-export&#13;
bias, export rebate rates and other export subsidies should also be&#13;
included in the iterations to calculate the required rates to equalize&#13;
the effective rates on domestic and export sales.&#13;
In the recent policy changes the emphasis of the Government has&#13;
been on the nominal rates.  The new tariff and export rebate rates were&#13;
set in an ad hoc manner without analytical back-up to work out their&#13;
impact on the effective rates.   It is not known,  therefore,  in what&#13;
direction the effective rates have been changed by the recent policy&#13;
changes or whether the variation in effective rates among sectors,&#13;
between public and private firms, and between domestic and export sales&#13;
has been narrowed or widened.&#13;
The confusion about the role of foreign exchange should also be&#13;
considered.   To encourage exports the policy package aims to rely more&#13;
on exchange rate policy than on direct export subsidies. This is why a&#13;
40 percent decrease in export rebate rates was planned for 1984 in&#13;
parallel with the commitment to a more realistic exchange rate policy.&#13;
But a realistic exchange rate policy would increase the net rate of&#13;
protection in both the domestic and the export markets in the same way;&#13;
it would not reduce an anti-export bias. However, it would free direct&#13;
export subsidies from the role of compensating for the effects of an&#13;
overvalued exchange rate.&#13;
Reducing the anti-export bias depends on the relative changes&#13;
in tariff rates on outputs and inputs, export rebate rates and various&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 129 -&#13;
subsidy  rates.   From  the way that the recent policy decisions were&#13;
taken, however, it is not known whether the anti-export bias is reduced.&#13;
Overall, the recent policy changes constitute an important step&#13;
towards the rationalization of the incentive system.   However, changes&#13;
in the tariff and rebate rates were rnade in an ad hoc fashion without&#13;
any consideration given to the interactions between them.   It is not&#13;
known, therefore, whether these policy actions can produce the desired&#13;
results. Under these circumstances the need for the proposed follow-up&#13;
study is even more important.&#13;

1.   DATA&#13;
The estimation of the coefficients was based on data for&#13;
123 manufacturing firms obtained through a sample survey organized by&#13;
Prof. M. Hic.  To have a high rate of representation in both public and&#13;
private activities,  the questionnaire was sent to 353 firms.   Only 165&#13;
firms  responded.       The  returned  questionnaires  were  checked  for&#13;
completeness and consistency by Dr.  I. Bircdal; 42 were unusable.   The&#13;
high rate of refusals and inconsistency, substantially reduced the degree&#13;
of representation in some sectors.   Thie remaining 123 firms constituted&#13;
the data source of the estimations.&#13;
The 123 firms, 19 of which are public, cover ninety-two 4-&#13;
digit, twenty-six 5-digit, and three 6-digit ISIC sectors. 1/&#13;
2.   PRICES&#13;
In view of the wide use of the QR in 1981, the NPCs were&#13;
calculated through a direct comparison of the domestic producer prices&#13;
and the c.i.f. import prices of similar products. Information on world&#13;
prices was collected by Dr.  Genceli  from the following sources:   (a)&#13;
sample firms; (b) trading companies; (c) commodity bulletins obtained&#13;
through  TSKB;  (d)  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  and  the  Ministry  of&#13;
Agriculture; and (e) the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce. 2/&#13;

Page 2 of 6&#13;
Adjustment of the NPCs for the quality differentials between&#13;
domestic  and  foreign  products  would  have  been  desirable.    Such  an&#13;
adjustment, however, has not been done in this study because it would&#13;
have involved a high degree of personal judgment and would have&#13;
introduced  subjectivity  into the data.   In addition,  it would  have&#13;
considerably delayed the completion of the study.  Adjustments for cost&#13;
differences between domestic and import products in the transportation&#13;
to the point of consumption would also have been desirable.  But since&#13;
the manufacturing industry is concentrated in the Marmara region and the&#13;
main  ports  are  also  in  that  region,  it  was  assumed  that  the&#13;
transportation costs did not differ for domestic and import products and&#13;
this adjustment was also not made.&#13;
Price  data  were  collected  on  a  product  basis.    But  the&#13;
effective rates and the comparative advantage indicators had to be&#13;
estimated for firms for which cost data were available.   Under these&#13;
circumstances, the product level NPCs were calculated first and the firm&#13;
level NPCs were then derived as the weighted averages, the weights being&#13;
the relative shares of the products in world prices. The same weighting&#13;
principle was also used in aggregating over markets, firms, and sectors.&#13;
3.   NON-TRADED INPUTS AND PROTECTION&#13;
Non-traded  inputs  are  not  subject  to  international  trade.&#13;
Therefore, they do not have world prices.  In calculating the effective&#13;
rates, non-traded input have to be broken down into their tradeable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

input,  value-added,  and  tax  components  (Corden  method).    The  same&#13;
considerations apply to depreciation.&#13;
In this study, non-traded inputs (in six categories) ana&#13;
depreciation (for four fixed assets) were decomposed by Michel Noel&#13;
using the 1973 input-output table.  The author made some adjustments in&#13;
these coefficients on the basis of information obtained from firms.  The&#13;
coefficients are presented in Tables A.1 and A.2.&#13;

To calculate the effective rates, the tradeable and the value&#13;
added components of non-traded inputs and depreciation were added to the&#13;
value of tradeables used directly in processing and to value added in&#13;
processing,  respectively.    Since  this  adjustment  was made  for both&#13;
domestic and world market values, the effective rates pertain to value&#13;
added in both processing and non-traded inputs.&#13;
4.   SHADOW PRICES&#13;
Initially, a separate study was planned to estimate the shadow&#13;
prices of the primary inputs to be used in the estimation of comparative&#13;
advantage coefficients.   But the study was not completed.   The author&#13;
had to estimate them in a short period of time in order to avoid delays&#13;
in the project.&#13;
The shadow exchange rate was estimated with the methodology&#13;
suggested by Balassa (1974). It turned out to be 14 percent higher than&#13;
the actual  exchange rate.   The shadow rate of return to capital  was&#13;
assumed  to  be 0.12.    This  is the  rate used by  the  State Planning&#13;
Organization in project evaluation.   It is also comparable to the rates&#13;
used by the World Bank and the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey.&#13;
There are three labor categories in the program:   managers,&#13;
skilled labor, and semi-skilled and unskilled labor.   Shadow wages for&#13;
the first two categories were assumed to be equal to the actual wages.&#13;
In turn, the shadow wage for the third category was taken to be 20&#13;
percent lower than the actual wage.&#13;

5.   COST OF CAPITAL&#13;
The stock of fixed capital and the accumulated depreciation (in&#13;
six  categories)  were  revalued.    This  revaluation  was  necessary  to&#13;
eliminate the distortions created in the firms' financial  accounts by&#13;
the inflation in recent years.  All estimates were based on the revalued&#13;
fixed capital and depreciation.&#13;
To calculate  the  shadow cost of capital, the capital  stock&#13;
should be expressed in shadow prices. This was done by decomposing each&#13;
category of fixed capital into its foreign exchange, labor, and land&#13;
components.   These components were expressed in shadow prices and then&#13;
added up.   The resulting capital  stock, which was measured at shadow&#13;
prices, was multiplied with 0.12 to calculate the shadow capital cost.&#13;
The decomposition coefficients of fixecl capital are shown in Table A.3.&#13;

6. THE PROGRAM&#13;
The coefficients were estimated with the INCA Unit's computer&#13;
program.    This  program was originally  prepared  for the Western Africa&#13;
Study and has region-specific features.   It had to be adapted to Turkey.&#13;
The program had been very poorly documented and contained some errors.&#13;
Learning the program, discovering the errors, and getting the errors&#13;
corrected took some time.   The new version of the program is very well&#13;
documented (Lee 1983).&#13;

            Protection and incentives in Turkish
            manufacturing : an evaluation of policies and their impact
            in 1981
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Turkey has made piecemeal use of
            protective and incentive measures and has not given
            sufficient attention to the interdependence of these
            instruments and their net effect on different market
            destinations and sectors. Quantification of the incidence of
            the system of protection and incentives in Turkish
            manufacturing in 1981 led to the following findings: (i)
            both nominal and effective protection are high and differ
            substantially among sectors, between public and private
            firms, and between domestic and export markets; (ii) tariff
            redundancy exists in many sectors; (iii) there is a
            substantial bias against the private sector; (iv) there is a
            heavy bias against exports in spite of generous export
            subsidies; (v) domestic resource cost is high in many
            sectors and differs substantially among them; (vi) the cost
            is substantially higher in the public sector; (vii) social
            profitability is higher in the private sector; and (viii)
            wide differences exist between social and private
            profitability among sectors and between public and private
            firms. These wide variations need to be narrowed, which will
            require restructuring in the whole incentive system, not
            just in import protection.
