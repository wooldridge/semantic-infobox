I.  BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1    Tanzania's estimated GNP per capita of US$ 100 places it amongst the poorest countries of the&#13;
2&#13;
world . The social indicators present a dismal picture: gross primary school enrollment rates of 63 percent&#13;
are lower than virtually all of sub-Saharan Africa and secondary school enrollment rates of 4 percent are&#13;
the lowest in the world. An infant mortality rate of 115 per thousand exceeds sub Saharan Africa's&#13;
average of 104 and adult mortality has more than tripled in the last decade.&#13;
1.2    Six years after Independence, in 1967, the Government announced the Arusha Declaration and&#13;
called for establishment of a socialist society. The public sector was given a leading role and state control&#13;
was extended throughout the economy. While the Government was able to forge a unified nation, and to&#13;
make progress in improving social conditions, structural weaknesses within the economy began to emerge.&#13;
By the mid-1980s economic decline and macroeconomic imbalances were severe with increasing budget&#13;
deficits, high rates of monetary expansion and inflation, and a significantly overvalued shilling. Real per&#13;
capita incomes were falling, exports collapsed, industrial output declined sharply, imports were reduced,&#13;
and severe inefficiencies in production and distribution resulted in widespread shortages. Social progress&#13;
achieved in the 1 970s began to be reversed and the lack of revenues severely hampered the maintenance of&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
A.    THE MACROECONOMY AND ADJUSTMENT&#13;
The Adjustment Program&#13;
1.1    Beginning in 1986, the Government embarked on a program to reform and fundamentally change&#13;
the existing approach to economic development by dismantling the system of pervasive economic controls&#13;
and encouraging more active participation of the private sector in the economy. Structural reforms,&#13;
particularly relating to traditional exports and the parastatal and financial sectors, were not fully&#13;
completed, and macroeconomic stabilization remained elusive. Nevertheless, the economy responded well&#13;
to the reforms that were implemented (notably, liberalization of food crop marketing and progressive&#13;
improvements in foreign exchange management) and the accompanying increased availability of external&#13;
resources. Official estimates indicate that both GDP and exports grew by more than 4 percent per year&#13;
during 1986-94, with increased production of food and traditional export crops and strong rise in&#13;
nontraditional exports.&#13;
Poverty Reduction During Structural Adjustment&#13;
1.2    Recent household surveys have shown that the adjustment program has been successful in reducing&#13;
the incidence of poverty. The devaluation of the shilling and removal of restrictions on the marketing of&#13;
food crops boosted incomes of smallholder agricultural families. The increased availability of consumer&#13;
goods as a result of liberalization directly benefited the rural poor (as well as the urban poor who also&#13;
benefited from increased supplies of food from liberalized agricultural marketing), and liberalization&#13;
opened new earnings opportunities for rural women and for off-farm employment. Sample surveys for the&#13;
preparation of a Poverty Profile suggest that the percentage of poor declined from about 70 percent of the&#13;
rural population in the early 1980s to about 50 percent in the early 1990s. The liberalization program&#13;
2   However, this official estimate of GNP may be seriously understated, as indicated by a recent survey of&#13;
household expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
increased the access of small-scale enterprises to production inputs which facilitated expansion of low-&#13;
wage employment in the informal sector.&#13;
Macroeconomic Performance&#13;
1.3   Progress has been made in reformiing the foreign exchange and trade systems over the last two&#13;
years. Tanzania has moved to an interbank market and has abolished all export retention and import&#13;
licensing. Excessive monetary expansion has been fueled by worsening fiscal management. The fiscal&#13;
deficit (including grants) exceeded 8 percent of GDP in FY93 and 7 percent in FY94, after broadly&#13;
balanced positions in the previous four years. This reflected widespread and increasing customs duty&#13;
exemptions, an increasingly inefficient tax administration and the failure of the expenditure control system.&#13;
Inflation has continued at over 25 percent and has recently accelerated. Real GDP growth averaged about&#13;
3-4 percent during FY92 to FY94. GroNvth in FY95 is likely to be seriously compromised by weak&#13;
economic management and severe power shortages caused largely by less-than-average rainfall exacerbated&#13;
by excess demand and delays in taking demand management measures by the authorities. These&#13;
developments are limiting the scope for generating employment and, in particular, the high inflation rates&#13;
resulting from macroeconomic mismanagement are eroding the real incomes of the poor.&#13;
B.    THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR&#13;
1.4    Agriculture is the foundation of the Tanzanian economy, providing employment, food and exports.&#13;
Some 84 percent of the employed population are in agriculture, producing 61 percent of both GDP and&#13;
merchandise exports. Tanzania's 3.7 million farm families work small holdings with an average cultivated&#13;
area of 0.9 hectares. Some 93 percent of all farmners cultivate less than 2.0 hectares each.&#13;
1.5   Food crop production dominates the agricultural economy totaling 55 percent of agricultural GDP,&#13;
with livestock accounting for 30 percent, and the traditional cash crops (coffee, cotton, cashews, sugar,&#13;
pyrethrum, tea, tobacco, sisal) for only 8 percent. Fishing and hunting contribute 6 percent and forestry I&#13;
percent of agricultural GDP.&#13;
1.6    Average GDP growth for the whole economy since the mid-i 970s has been below the population&#13;
growth rate. Between 1967 and 1978. the population grew at 3.3 percent per annum versus 3.6 percent per&#13;
annum for GDP. While population growth slowed to 2.8 percent per annum between 1978 and 1988,&#13;
GDP grew only at 1.7 percent per annum. As a result, GDP per capita fell during the early 1980s, and is&#13;
only now beginning to rise to the levels enjoyed in the early 1970s. Presently real income per capita,&#13;
evaluated using various deflators, is not much higher than it was in the mid-1950s.&#13;
1.7    Real growth in agricultural GDP3 has paralleled total GDP growth from 1966 through 1992.&#13;
Agriculture averaged 2.8 and GDP averaged 2.7 percent per annum. The similarity is misleading; there&#13;
have been sharp divergences between growth in agriculture and GDP. Growth in agriculture lagged&#13;
significantly behind GDP during the initial period of increased Government intervention and control of the&#13;
economy. Average annual growth rates differed by some 45 percent in 1966-75, and 65 percent in 1976-&#13;
80. In the early 1980s, the bottom of the economic decline, agriculture had actually started to recover,&#13;
even while GDP growth was negative. Agriculture growth has led the economy through the periods of&#13;
reform and economic recuperation since the early 1980s, responding to the earlier reforms in marketing of&#13;
agricultural produce.&#13;
3   Unless mentioned specifically, all trend growth rates are average annual exponential rates, calculated using&#13;
the least squares method.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
Constraints to Agricultural Growth&#13;
1.8    Agricultural development in Tanzania faces tremendous challenges. To be successful farmers&#13;
have to overcome the problems of distance from markets for products and inputs; diseases affecting both&#13;
livestock and crops, and the normal variations in rainfall and climate. In a semi-subsistence agricultural&#13;
economy such as Tanzania's, growth in food production will always continue at more or less the rate of&#13;
growth in population. Provided new arable land is available and accessible, and there is political stability,&#13;
the process of expansion whereby new rural families bring additional land into cultivation to provide&#13;
themselves with their basic food needs, is continuous. For growth in agricultural production to surpass&#13;
population growth, subsistence farmers need to be brought into a market economy where the availability of&#13;
consumer goods provides incentives for cash generation and off-farm sales. The market also provides the&#13;
ingredients for increasing the productivity of labor on the farm, as well as an outlet for marketable produce.&#13;
Rates of agricultural growth will be greater than population growth to the extent that smallholder semi-&#13;
subsistence farmners are brought successfully into the cash economy.&#13;
1.9    Factors which have constrained agricultural growth over the past 20 years include areas where&#13;
Government policy or institutional inadequacy have hindered the successful, voluntary, integration of the&#13;
smallholder farmer into the cash economy. These factors can be characterized in three ways: (i) the&#13;
consequences of centralized economic management from 1967 to 1982; (ii) a decline in the efficiency of&#13;
public services; and (iii) the inadequate development of supporting markets. In particular, improved&#13;
literacy and expansion of rural infrastructure, particularly market access roads, are preconditions to a&#13;
successful development of the rural market economy. While the Government had made great strides in&#13;
reducing illiteracy in rural areas over the past twenty years, these improvements have been hard to&#13;
maintain. Rural roads have also been allowed to deteriorate.&#13;
The Nature of Future Agricultural Growth4&#13;
1.10   To maintain high rates of growth in agricultural output Tanzania will have to focus in the short run&#13;
on export crops, where world markets can absorb the increased production without affecting prices. The&#13;
crops where growth increased in 1986-91 are those sold in the more elastic export markets (coffee, cotton,&#13;
cashew, tea). For these commodities, growth rates have measured 2.4 percent per annum, up from -7.9&#13;
percent in 1981-85. The production of raw material for domestic light industry (cotton, sisal, leather,&#13;
fruits and vegetables) will also be important. Those crops and livestock products with high income&#13;
elasticities of demand can expect to see their domestic markets expand. Food production can also be&#13;
expected to grow, although perhaps not as rapidly as for export crops, in response to population growth,&#13;
increases in per capita incomes and as improved technology becomes accessible to small farmers.&#13;
1.11   Thus, the sources of growth in Tanzania's agriculture sector will come from two sets of factors:&#13;
In the short term, the move to a market oriented economy has removed the distortions in the&#13;
exchange rate and other prices, the inefficiencies of monopolistic parastatals and cooperative&#13;
unions, and the need to circumvent restrictive regulations. This has resulted in adjustment and&#13;
growth in all sectors. The returns to adjustment in the cereals subsector have already been&#13;
realized, and growth will taper off. However, there should be a surge in exports, up to the&#13;
ceilings determined by current capacity levels in the processing industries, as the breakup of&#13;
monopolies increases efficiency in cotton ginning, coffee rmilling, cashew and pyrethrum&#13;
processing, and as export marketing opens up to the private sector, providing new&#13;
opportunities in traditional and non-traditional crops, .&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
* In the medium term, continued growth in agricultural output will depend mainly on (i) the&#13;
traditional expansion of food production for the domestic market as rural population growth&#13;
causes an increase in the area under cultivation and livestock holdings, and (ii) increases in&#13;
food production for the domestic market as technological change (and investments in on-farm&#13;
improvements, including irrigation works) causes labor productivity to increase and real prices&#13;
to fall; and (iii) increases in production of food or plantation crops for intemational export, as&#13;
investment in the processing industries for crops such as coffee, cotton, cashews, and non-&#13;
traditional high value items expands production capacity and reduces unit costs. The following&#13;
factors will also contribute to agricultural growth: (iv) increases in production of food,&#13;
especially animal products and food crops other than starches and cereals, as higher per capita&#13;
incomes cause effective demand to rise; (v) increases in production of food for regional export&#13;
markets, as new markets are found for maize, pulses, and oilseeds for example; and (vi)&#13;
increases in the production of export crops as technological advances reduce production costs&#13;
at the farm level, for coffee, cashews and cotton in particular.&#13;
Natural Resource Management and the Environment&#13;
1.12   The management of the country's natural resources is weak. While very large, these resources are&#13;
threatened by factors linked to unmanaged development. The main threat to the country's natural forests is&#13;
uncontrolled clearing for charcoal, logging, tobacco curing, and cultivation of all crops. Select hardwood&#13;
species are also being extracted without regard to fees or permits. Lake Victoria is threatened by pollution&#13;
from the urban centers on its shores, from the runoff of fertilizers and agrochemicals, and from&#13;
uncontrolled proliferation of water hyacinth. Coastal waters are threatened by the practice of dynamiting&#13;
of coral reefs in search of fish. Wildlife management is threatened by the encroachment of reserved areas&#13;
by cultivation. In certain regions erosion and shortened fallows are affecting the sustainability of&#13;
cultivation. While the country's natural resources are not near depletion, they will be if the current trends&#13;
are allowed to continue. The need to improve management of water is discussed in the next section of the&#13;
report.&#13;
1.13   Effective steps are needed to strengthen the management of forests lands, the conservation of&#13;
reserves, and the collection of fees and royalties for wood harvested. The ability of a weak and sparsely&#13;
distributed forest service has recently been strengthened under a recent donor and IDA-funded Forest&#13;
Resources Management Project (Cr. 2335-TA).&#13;
1.14   The lead role in defining national policy on environmental issues is now in the hands of the Vice&#13;
President's Office, and the autonomous semi-Governmental National Environment Management Council.&#13;
The recently completed National Environment Action Plan focused on the need for priority action in the key&#13;
areas of land degradation, water supply, environmental pollution, marine and freshwater resource&#13;
management, habitat conservation and the loss of biodiversity, and deforestation. The action program&#13;
includes continuing the NEAP consultation process and completion and adoption of the draft National&#13;
Environment Policy. In addition, a revision of the legislative framework is needed to more fully enable&#13;
local participation in environmental management and in order to introduce the incentives and regulatory&#13;
mechanisms to encourage sustainable natural resource use, including implementation of new land, forest&#13;
and wildlife protection legislation; developing the means for assessing the environmental impact of future&#13;
development initiatives; strengthening environmental education and public awareness programs; and the&#13;
preparation of a priority long-term investment program. The Government intends to design incentives such&#13;
as pricing policies, concession arrangements, revenue collection systems, and systems of resource tenure&#13;
and property rights which are consistent with the objective of minimizing the further depletion of natural&#13;
resources. The project will support these initiatives in the water sector.&#13;

C.    WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND IRRIGATION DEVELOPMENT&#13;
Water Resource Management&#13;
1.15   Surface Waters. Tanzania has defined nine river basins for water resources administration. The&#13;
Rufiji is the largest and covers 177,000 kin2, 18 percent of Mainland Tanzania. It drains the Southem&#13;
Highlands into the Indian Ocean. The smaller Ruvu/Wami basin flows into the Indian Ocean north of Dar&#13;
es Salaam, and supplies water for domestic and industrial uses. The highly developed Pangani basin&#13;
carries waters from Mt. Kilimanjaro and the Northern Highlands East into the Indian Ocean. The waters in&#13;
the Northwest drain North into Lake Victoria, the Nile Basin. The Malagarasi river runs West into Lake&#13;
Tanganyika. Extensive wetlands line rivers across the country and provide essential habitat for fisheries.&#13;
The deltas of coastal rivers are especially irnportant as nursery areas for aquatic life. Mangrove trees line&#13;
the brackish edge of these important wetlands. About one-third of Tanzania is arid or semniarid, with&#13;
rainfall below 800 mm. Another third lies in highland areas with precipitation in excess of 1,000mm. The&#13;
long dry season (June to October) results in low river flows, causing seasonal scarcity. Recently, scarcity&#13;
and conflict amongst users has been exacerbated by a few years of less than average rainfall, coupled with&#13;
the expansion of irrigation and the increase in demand for hydropower and water for urban uses.&#13;
1.16   Groundwater. Very old "Precambrian " rocks underlie more than 75 percent of the country.&#13;
They generally yield water only in joints, or fractures and are therefore fairly low in yield, although suitable&#13;
for village water supply. There are groundwater aquifers of quite variable yields -- from productive&#13;
volcanic alluvium near Mt. Kilimanjaro and high-yielding coastal limestone deposits to very low yielding&#13;
clay deposits of old lake beds. Less than one-third of the country can be characterized by groundwater in&#13;
productive areas of sand, sandstone, and alluvial aquifers. Knowledge of groundwater resources is sketchy.&#13;
Groundwater use is greatest in the Pangani, and some abstractions take place in the Ruvu/Wami and the&#13;
Inland Drainage Basin (around Lake Natron).&#13;
1.17   Groundwater is a key source of water for both rural and urban areas, including the cities of&#13;
Arusha, Dodoma, and Mtwara. Before 1978, emphasis was on construction of deep wells to tap protected,&#13;
lower aquifers. By 1980, as much as 50 percent of these boreholes and water systems were inoperative&#13;
because of maintenance problems with the diesel pumps. Since that time, shallow aquifers have been&#13;
emphasized for water supply despite their vulnerability to pollution and uncertain yield.&#13;
1.18   Irrigation. Irrigated agriculture is the largest "consumptive" user of surface and groundwater.&#13;
Demand is growing rapidly with the incentives provided under a liberalized agricultural market.&#13;
Developments in irrigation are described in paras 1.36 through 1.39.&#13;
1.19   Hydropower Demand. Eighty percent of the electricity in Tanzania comes from hydropower.&#13;
Practically all the hydropower generating capacity in the countly is in the Rufiji or the Pangani Basin, the&#13;
two basins targeted for project interventions. The Mtera and Kidatu plants with a total of 284 MW&#13;
installed capacity in the Rufiji River basin account for most of the hydropower installed capacity. The&#13;
installed capacity on the Pangani Basin is now 91 MW5 following the commissioning of the Pangani Falls&#13;
project in early 1995. The Kihansi project in the Rufiji Basin will provide an additional 180 MW by 1999.&#13;
In both basins the power stations are downstream of most of the irrigation schemes and urban water&#13;
abstraction points. This makes water use for hydropower highly subtractable from other uses. Conflicts&#13;
have already developed between the needs for irrigation and water supply for storage, and hydropower flow&#13;
requirements, including evaporation losses from the regulating reservoirs.&#13;
5   Pangani Falls with 66 MW, Hale with 17 MW and Nyumba ya Mungu with 8 MW.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
1.20   Domestic Water Use. Some 68 percent of urban dwellers have a piped water supply, much of&#13;
which is unreliable. In Dar es Salaam, domestic consumption accounts for approximately 70 percent of&#13;
consumption from the water distribution system. Industry and urban agriculture account for the remaining&#13;
30 percent. Demand for water exceeds supply in most urban centers. Tariffs are too low. Technical,&#13;
financial and managerial problems result in an under utilization of existing capacity. Of the total of 62&#13;
urban areas with piped water systems, over 90 percent reported serious deficiencies in the systems in 1990.&#13;
About 46 percent of rural dwellers have an adequate water supply. Water pollution and uncontrolled&#13;
abstractions interfere with water supply for humans and cattle, particularly in the dry season.&#13;
1.21   Water Quality. Serious water quality degradation was found in urban areas of Tanzania due to&#13;
poorly treated industrial waste water discharges and sewage. An industrial pollution discharge inventory&#13;
indicates that the priority areas of concentration include Dar es Salaam, Arusha-Moshi, Tanga, Lake&#13;
Victoria, and the Morogoro area which serves as the head-waters for the Ruvu River and the water supply&#13;
for Dar es Salaam. Adequate treatment of piped water by chemical additives, filtration and disinfecting is&#13;
often hampered by limited funds. Sewer collection systems are inadequate and may leak into groundwater.&#13;
Lack of proper sanitation and industrial pollution control have contributed to outbreaks of water bome&#13;
diseases such as cholera, typhoid and dysentery.&#13;
1.22   Transboundary Water Pollution. Tanzania shares many waterbodies with neighboring countries.&#13;
Of these, only Lake Victoria has been identified as having a serious pollution problem. Untreated&#13;
discharges of sewage from the country's second largest city (Mwanza) reach the lake. In addition, large&#13;
textile and tannery mills discharge toxic substances and oxygen demanding pollutants. Coffee processing,&#13;
cotton ginneries, vegetable oil, cosmetics, soap and 8-10 fish processing plants discharge oxygen&#13;
demanding wastes to the lake watershed. Other sources of contamination include mercury waste, coming&#13;
from mining areas in the Lake Basin, and runoff from the overuse of agrochemicals and fertilizer in cotton&#13;
production. A joint intemational effort to reduce pollution loading in the lake, and better manage fishing&#13;
and other activities is being supported by IDA and the Global Environment Fund.&#13;
1.23   Legislation, Policy, Water Allocation and Regulation. The regulatory and institutional&#13;
framework for water resources management is provided under the Water Utilization (Control and&#13;
Regulation) Act of 1974, amended in 1981. The Act, as amended, declares that all water is vested in the&#13;
United Republic of Tanzania, sets conditions on the use of water and authorizes the Principal Water&#13;
Officer, with Statutory Authority, to be responsible for setting policy and allocation of water rights at a&#13;
"national" level. For designated River Basins with their own water officer, these responsibilities are&#13;
delegated to the Basin Water Officer. A Central Water Board advises the Principal Water Officer. A&#13;
Basin Water Board advises the Basin Water Officer. Membership of both boards is at present limited to&#13;
officials from sectoral ministries and regional government, and would be broadened under the project to&#13;
include private water users and other stakeholders.&#13;
1.24   Despite these statutory powers, management of water resources by the Government has for a long&#13;
time been fragmented. The effectiveness of water resource management, and the application of the legal&#13;
framework, depend on the quality of a water rights administration. Under the legislation, and through the&#13;
above offices, the Ministry of Water (MOW) grants rights for each withdrawal of water for use in&#13;
domestic, industrial, hydropower, livestock, irrigation, environment and habitat preservation, or mining&#13;
activities. A maximum of 50 percent of the expected low flow of a river at a point can be granted as a right&#13;
to a person or corporation. This is done through a fairly lengthy procedure of application via the office of&#13;
the Regional Water Engineer located in each of the 20 administrative regions of the country. The&#13;
administrative system, centralizing information for the river basin, should: (i) be in a position to control&#13;
withdrawals of surface and groundwater by issuing and revoking water rights; and (ii) know at all times the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
quantity of water available in the basin, and its use, by monitoring both the sum of water rights granted,&#13;
and physical availability.&#13;
1.25   Such administrative systems have recently been created in the Pangani and Rufiji Basins, and are&#13;
still to be installed in the remaining basins. Even so, management of the waters in the Pangani and the&#13;
Rufiji is still rudimentary. Water resource management plans for the basins are only now being put&#13;
together, hampered by the lack of accurate and timely information. Data on precipitation, hydrometric&#13;
data, and actual abstractions for irrigation is inaccurate and sketchy. Planning is more advanced in the&#13;
Pangani Basin, where NORAD has provided assistance in the context of putting the new hydropower plant&#13;
in place at Pangani Falls. Much further work is needed to strengthen information gathering and analysis,&#13;
and to model water flow, in order to improve water management, and increase societal retums to the use of&#13;
this scarce resource. The project would respond to these requirements.&#13;
1.26   Planning in the water sector has also been disjointed, and only recently have efforts been made to&#13;
bring together a national picture of water availability and use. Virtually all work related to water resources&#13;
management and development has been carried out at the regional level. This has included the formulation&#13;
of Water Master Plans for 17 different regions all of which, with the exception of one, have been financed&#13;
and prepared by donor agencies in different formats and containing different types of information. The&#13;
main river basins were divided up into fragmented areas making water resource management difficult. The&#13;
authority of regional water engineers is also fragmented, as competition between regions for water become&#13;
an issue and essential data from regions do not get transferred to a central office.&#13;
1.27   National Water Policy. In an effort to improve the management of water resources, and with the&#13;
aim of achieving the ambitious goal of providing water within easy reach (400 meters or less) to all by the&#13;
year 2002, the Party adopted a National Water Policy for Tanzania in 1991. This policy, however, deals&#13;
mostly with water supply issues, and a number of important points relating to water management,&#13;
allocation and pollution control are not adequately addressed. A framework for preventing and resolving&#13;
conflicts among competing users and for regulating demand for water is needed. The conflicts surrounding&#13;
the inflow and use of water in the Mtera Reservoir crystallize the issue. This is not dealt with in the policy&#13;
paper. In addition the Policy proposes no change in law or introduction of incentives to improve the&#13;
effectiveness of water pollution controls. Nor does it fully address the fragmentation caused by the&#13;
continued existence of 20 regional water organizations and the resultant problems in resolving cross-cutting&#13;
regional water resources management issues. With these shortcomings, and an emphasis on drainage of&#13;
wetlands so land can be used productively and on other water development and flood control structures, the&#13;
1991 National Water Policy may result in actions which further degrade environmental quality in Tanzania.&#13;
The Bank and the Government would collaborate on the refinement of the National Water Policy under the&#13;
project.&#13;
1.28   Pricing Policies.  The legislation on water use does include a set of "economic water users fees,"&#13;
set forth in Subsidiary Legislation passed September 23, 1994. In addition the entities supplying water to&#13;
the final consumer charge for this service, with dues payable in cash in urban areas, and often in terms of&#13;
labor contribution to system maintenance in rural irrigation schemes. The price of water does not at&#13;
present reflect its true scarcity value. Neither the basin level "economic users fees" nor the charges for&#13;
delivery of water cover the true cost of the resource. This causes two types of problems. In both the water&#13;
supply sector, as well as in irrigation, insufficient revenues are generated to cover operation and&#13;
maintenance costs. The quality of the service, and of the water received, is undermined. A second problem&#13;
is that the low tariffs encourage inefficient use of water and waste by industry, consumers and irrigators.&#13;
As a result much of the urban population in Tanzania is being undersupplied. Wastage levels are very high&#13;
in irrigation schemes, especially small scale traditional schemes, where irrigation efficiency is very low.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
1.29 Plans are in effect to progressively increase water tariffs throughout Tanzania. With regard to the&#13;
"economic water users fees" to be collected by basin water offices, it is proposed under this project that&#13;
these rates be raised to a level which would provide sufficient funds to support the administration of basin&#13;
water offices, including the collection of information on water quality and availability, the enforcement of&#13;
pollution standards, and the administration and monitoring of water rights. Charges for delivery of water in&#13;
irrigation schemes to be collected by water user associations, would be adjusted to cover operation and&#13;
maintenance costs and any basin water charges. These principles would be used by smallholder irrigation&#13;
schemes, for example, especially those which received assistance under this project, in determining the&#13;
charges to be paid by irrigators for water delivered.&#13;
1.30   Relationship With Other Riparians.  The project seeks to improve river basin management and&#13;
improve smallholder irrigation efficiency in the Pangani and the Rufiji river basins. The Rufiji Basin is&#13;
contained wholly within the territory of Tanzania. The Pangani basin (in Northern Tanzania) does extend&#13;
marginally into Kenya. Lake Jipe stretches across the border between the two countries, just east of Mt.&#13;
Kilimanjaro and receives some of its water from Kenya. This lake supplies water to a tributary to the&#13;
Ruvu river, at the northern end of the Pangani Basin. The Ruvu itself, with its main catchment in&#13;
Tanzania, supplies water to some 7,000 ha of traditional irrigation schemes, which have been in operation&#13;
for decades. While the selection of the exact schemes to be rehabilitated over the six year implementation&#13;
period have still to be defined, the project is likely to rehabilitate a few of the schemes along the Ruvu river.&#13;
Project objectives are to rehabilitate and upgrade infrastructure on existing schemes. No additional water&#13;
will be drawn from the river, and no additional area will be brought under irrigation. Indeed, an objective&#13;
of the project is to improve irrigation efficiency, and reduce water abstractions from the river for a given&#13;
area under irrigation. It may be the case that traditional schemes along the Ruvu would be rehabilitated&#13;
under the project.&#13;
1.31   Under the provisions of OP 7 .50,6 the proposed project comes under the exception to notification&#13;
requirements granted for "rehabilitation" of ongoing irrigation schemes. It should be noted that in this case&#13;
Tanzania is the lowest downstream riparian, and the waters from Kenya flow into a system which is&#13;
otherwise completely contained in Tanzania. On the issue of whether the viability of the Bank funded&#13;
investments in improved irrigation infrastructure "will not be adversely affected by the other riparians'&#13;
possible water use," it is the Bank's judgment that the possibility of Kenya materially affecting flows out of&#13;
Lake Jipe into the Pangani basin and the Ruvu river is minimal. For these reasons it is the Bank's policy&#13;
that Tanzania is not required to notify Kenya on its intention to undertake this type of project, although it&#13;
may choose to do so in the spirit of intemational cooperation on riparian issues.&#13;
1.32   Water Use by Pastoralists in the Usangu Plain. Immigration of both pastoralists and cultivators&#13;
into the Usangu Plain (in the upper catchment of the Ruaha river) has been sustained for many years.&#13;
Gradually, the cultivable areas and the grazing lands have been occupied, and recently conflicts over water&#13;
and land management have erupted between the pastoral groups and the cultivators.&#13;
1.33   Conflict between herders and farmers arises from two main sources: 1) livestock trespass on farms&#13;
without permission and damaging crops and fields, and 2) farmers cultivate in areas that have been&#13;
explicitly designated as grazing areas by village councils. Forage is scarce in the dry season. Crop stubble&#13;
remaining on harvested fields is a desirable resource. Herders having large livestock herds - especially the&#13;
Sukuma -- graze their animals on rice and maize stubble without permission from farmers, often destroying&#13;
remaining crops, irrigation canals and bunds, and damaging fields in the process. This phenomenon has led&#13;
to violent conflict between the Sukuma and farmers and remains unresolved. Herders are desperate for dry&#13;
6   World Bank Operational Policy Guidelines, No. 7.50, "Projects on International Waterways".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
season resources. The more those resources dwindle, the greater the conflict. Conversely, farmers in sorne&#13;
villages experience land shortages for irrigation during the wet season and establish fields on lands that&#13;
have been specifically set aside for grazing by village councils. Herders then suffer wet season pasture&#13;
shortages, and have taken farmers to court.&#13;
1.34   Formal village demarcation and titling activities, and land use planning to formally designate&#13;
cultivation and grazing zones with land titles verifying the boundaries of these areas would help to reduce&#13;
herder-farmer conflict, and make individuals more accountable. Pastoralists would benefit from secure&#13;
land tenure rights, which would in turn facilitate pastoral resource management and rangeland&#13;
conservation. These activities would be undertaken under the auspices of the World Bank funded Forest&#13;
Resources Management Project (-r. 2335-TA), with support from this project. A special study of pastoral&#13;
land tenure and resource use on the Usangu Plains would be financed under this project to assist in&#13;
resolving these problems. The situation is summarized in Annex F.&#13;
1.35   Water Quality Management. The Water Utilization (Control and Regulation) Act of 1974 was&#13;
amended in 1981 mainly to provide for the creation of basin management, to strengthen water pollution&#13;
control and to establish standards for effluent discharges. In 1988, these changes were finally implemented&#13;
with the creation of a Central Water Board with executive powers for specifying pollution control measures&#13;
and enforcing them. However, government has not been able to enforce these new standards. Penalties&#13;
have been very low, and there is little incentive for industries, and polluters to install control measures.&#13;
Government efforts are also hampered by resource allocations inadequate to support aggressive policing&#13;
and data collection efforts.&#13;
Irrigation Development&#13;
1.36   There are three reasons why the development of irrigation systems is an important aspect of an&#13;
agricultural development strategy. First, the variability inherent in Tanzania's rainfed production systems&#13;
creates problems of shortages of the main foodcrops in years of inadequate or poorly timed rainfall. For&#13;
this reason, policy makers concerned about food security have always sought to increase food production in&#13;
irrigated areas, and to reduce this variation. Second, irrigation schemes if properly managed, provide&#13;
sustainable increases in small farmer productivity and income, addressing rural poverty alleviation and&#13;
environmental management objectives. Finally, irrigated agriculture is the only way in which high value&#13;
crops (vegetables, flowers) can be produced under the controlled conditions needed to meet market&#13;
schedules in Europe and other demanding international markets, thus supporting the drive for diversified&#13;
high value agricultural exports. The statement on irrigation policy in the 1983 National Agricultural&#13;
Policy document reaffirmed Government's commitment to developing smallholder irrigation schemes, while&#13;
addressing problems which had affected such projects in the past. The 1983 policy document noted that&#13;
irrigation projects had floundered due to:&#13;
*  lack of an irrigation development policy&#13;
*  reliance on sophisticated irrigation techniques, which demanded heavy investment, highly&#13;
trained manpower, and a lot of foreign exchange;&#13;
*  lack of expertise in the design and construction of large irrigation schemes;&#13;
*  poor planning, especially of small-farmer schemes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
1.37 Irrigated agriculture is one of the two largest "consumptive" users of surface and groundwater.7&#13;
Demand is growing rapidly with the incentives provided under a liberalized agricultural market. It is&#13;
estimated that some 80 percent of all irrigation water is used for the 150,000 ha thought to be under&#13;
"traditional" irrigation by smallholder farmers, using "run of the river" techniques. Rice and vegetables are&#13;
the main crops produced in such schemes. On-farm water management is through traditional furrows or&#13;
small basins. These are poorly drained and prone to water logging and salinization. Smallholder schemes&#13;
are unable to control their abstractions of water from rivers and streams. There is no charge for water use,&#13;
leading to waste. Fluctuations in river flows make continuous access to irrigation water unpredictable,&#13;
diminishing crop yields. Poorly designed canals lose water. The irrigation efficiency in such schemes is&#13;
low, estimated at 15-20 percent. Access to water is uneven within schemes. Allocations to farmers at the&#13;
tail-end of the canals are often uncertain. Water rights for irrigation are either recognized under traditional&#13;
riparian arrangements, or are obtainable at a fee. While larger users possess a "water right" issued by the&#13;
Ministry of Water (MOW), the fines for excess water use are minimal and rarely applied. Some 25,000&#13;
ha are irrigated under large, modem, expensive, centrally managed schemes, with precision-engineered&#13;
infrastructure. Most of these are State Farms run by National Food Corporation (NAFCO) or Sugar&#13;
Development Corporation (SUDECO), producing rice and sugar. In addition, there is a Government-&#13;
controlled smallholder rice scheme on the upper Pangani, and a few private farms in the Moshi-Arusha area&#13;
producing irrigated flowers and vegetables for the European market. The area which is potentially irrigable&#13;
in Tanzania is large, possibly as much as 850,000 hectares. The results of an FAO study in the late 1980s&#13;
which assessed irrigable area (taking both soil and water constraints into consideration) are noted in Annex&#13;
C.8&#13;
1.38   The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOA), with assistance from FAO and UNDP has&#13;
been reviewing the Government's experience with irrigation projects, and have concluded that:&#13;
-  The emphasis should be on rehabilitation and improvement of existing smallholder schemes,&#13;
and "future development should be based on staged improvement and expansion of existing&#13;
local technology, which allows the farmers to adapt at their own pace. Equal emphasis should&#13;
be given to operational and extension support to farmers at existing schemes."&#13;
* In some cases, projects undertaken to date have been too sophisticated, requiring expensive&#13;
structures and massive capital injections. The funds for completing these projects have often&#13;
not materialized, causing a massive waste of resources invested in unused, half completed&#13;
schemes;&#13;
*  If a project is expensive to begin with (certain recent donor funded projects in Tanzania have&#13;
cost $15,000 to $20,000 per ha to cover the costs of precision land levelling and sophisticated&#13;
water distribution systems), incremental yields and prices will have to be very good, for the&#13;
economic rate of return to be satisfactory. The possibilities for marketing such high value&#13;
crops, or for getting cropping intensities above 100 percent, is limited to small, well-managed&#13;
private farms at present;&#13;
* For smallholder irrigation schemes to succeed, management of water and land use should be in&#13;
the hands of water user associations representing the interests of participant small farmners.&#13;
7   The other large consumptive use is due to the increase in evaporation from the reservoirs behind the Mtera&#13;
and Nymba ya Mungu dams, created to support electric power generation.&#13;

1.39   Following this review, MOA has published the National Irrigation Development Plan (October&#13;
1994). This plan reiterates the priorities:&#13;
* rehabilitation or upgrading of existing traditional irrigation schemes in all regions where this&#13;
type of irrigation is significant;&#13;
&#149; upgrading traditional water harvesting technology in such regions where more intensive&#13;
irrigation is not feasible;&#13;
* investment in new smallholder schemes in those regions where conditions are appropriate, and&#13;
traditional schemes do not exist.&#13;
Under the National Irrigation Development Plan, a ranking of potential projects has been developed, and a&#13;
smallholder-focused irrigation rehabilitation and development program has been outlined. The project&#13;
would follow the priorities and guidelines put forward in this Plan.&#13;
D.     GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES IN AGRICULTURE AND WATER MANAGEMENT&#13;
The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOA)&#13;
1.40   The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives is charged with the responsibility for policy&#13;
guidance, coordination and development of agriculture and livestock production. MOA's main functions&#13;
are to increase the supply of public goods which support agricultural development, and monitor and&#13;
regulate private sector activities. Key activities include the need to (i) provide extension services and&#13;
training to peasant farmers especially for foodcrops; (ii) invest in agricultural research, especially in food&#13;
crops; (iii) formulate policies to improve the efficiency of agricultural marketing; and (iv) register, promote&#13;
and advise the development of cooperatives, and other rural organizations. MOA has been reorganized&#13;
several times since independence in 1961. The most recent reorganization was in November 1990, when&#13;
the cooperative division was retumed to the Ministry.&#13;
1.41   The current structure of MOA still reflects the Government's interventionist role of the 1970s and&#13;
early 1980s. Many functional assignments are redundant, and other key functions associated with policy&#13;
monitoring and formulation are still weak. The Ministry has some 19,000 staff, spread across HQ,&#13;
regional, district and village levels, including 5,600 village extension agents. The Ministry still has&#13;
departments for delivering veterinary services, agricultural mechanization services, as well as for&#13;
undertaking parastatal monitoring. As mentioned in the Letter of Institutional Development Policy:&#13;
"Government priorities for agricultural institutions are undergoing corresponding changes, with&#13;
the focus shifting to the provision of basic social and infrastructural services to the economy, and&#13;
away from involvement in productive activities. This shift emphasized an agricultural&#13;
production system more determined by market forces and the activities of farmers, cooperative&#13;
societies, and other private sector agents, and less determined by direct government intervention.&#13;
To rectify this situation, the Govermnent has initiated a series of reforms to redefine its role,&#13;
including such policy changes as restructuring the tasks of the grain and export crop marketing&#13;
boards and adopting the initial steps to reorganize the cooperative system . The Govermnent's&#13;
strategic vision for institutional development of the agricultural sector calls for changes so that:&#13;
(i) the legal and regulatory framework promotes an enabling environment for the expansion of&#13;
production, trade and investment by the private sector; (ii) government organizations phase out,&#13;
through an orderly process, functions best carried out by the private sector, after which the&#13;
Government will provide only those goods and services that are public in nature and that serve as&#13;
catalysts for agricultural growth, in line with national objectives; and (iii) the institutions'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
internal incentive and resource allocation systems promote and facilitate high quality&#13;
performance in these areas where the Government has a critical role to play."&#13;
1.42   IDA is assisting the Government in this reform exercise, through the Agriculture Sector&#13;
Management project (ASMP) financed by Credit 2537-TA, effective in early 1994. With assistance from&#13;
this project, the Governnent is in the process of redefining MOA's priority role and functions, and will&#13;
propose a fundamental restructuring of the MOA in early 1996. The restructuring proposals will include a&#13;
redefinition of the role of the Irrigation Department. This department will be given a much less&#13;
interventionist role. It would support small farmer irrigation through the formulation of policies,&#13;
supporting the formation of water user associations or cooperatives, capable of managing irrigation&#13;
schemes, working with such associations to improve scheme infrastructure and management, and where&#13;
funding permits, using private sector services for studies, design and construction of infrastructural&#13;
improvements in selected high potential schemes, where farmers are committed to take over operation and&#13;
maintenance. The proposed project is designed to be implemented within the streamlined framework being&#13;
designed and executed under the aegis of the ASMP.&#13;
The Ministry of Water&#13;
1.43   Monitoring and regulation of water use in Tanzania is the responsibility of the Ministry of Water&#13;
(MOW). Under the Water Utilization (Control and Regulation) Act of 1974, "All water in Tanganyika is&#13;
vested in the United Republic"9 The Minister has the right to "regulate the use of water from any source in&#13;
any area of Tanganyika" if he or she deems it is in the national interest. Under the Law, the Minister is&#13;
empowered to grant and administer water use rights, through a series of Water Advisory Boards and Water&#13;
Officers, as noted previously.&#13;
1.44   The MOW's Water Resources Department is concemed with monitoring the quantity and quality&#13;
of surface and groundwater. This is carried out through a zonal and regional network of stations and&#13;
laboratories which undertake hydrological measurement, meteorological measurement, groundwater&#13;
measurement, water quality and sediment measurement. The structure for regulation of river basins has&#13;
been described above. The Ministry also regulates urban water supply and sanitation services through a&#13;
series of Urban Water and Sanitation Boards, in a manner similar to the basin water management system.&#13;
Urban Water and Sanitation Boards have membership drawn from city and district govermnent, as well as&#13;
from other sectors of the Government. A recent feature in the management of urban water supply systems&#13;
has been the decentralization of management to these boards, including the establishment of financial&#13;
autonomy. Under this system, urban water and sanitation systems in selected larger towns, are able to set&#13;
and retain fee revenue to cover the costs of providing the service. This principle would be applied to river&#13;
basin management under the proposed project.&#13;
E.    BANK INVOLVEMENT IN THE AGRICULTURE AND WATER SECTORS&#13;
1.45   The program for supporting sustainable broad-based growth in the agricultural sector has included&#13;
the following ongoing projects. Strengthening of rural infrastructure, and market access, is being furthered&#13;
through the First and Second Integrated Roads Projects, cofinanced by 16 donors including IDA (Cr. 2149-&#13;
TA and 2598-TA) and the Sixth Highway Project (Cr. 1688-TA), which have supported rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance of key highways, trunk roads, and some feeder and access roads. Within the agriculture&#13;
sector, the Agricultural Export Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1891-TA), has supported the rehabilitation of&#13;
processing infrastructure for export crops; the Cashew and Coconut Treecrops Project (Cr. 2050-TA)&#13;
9   Water Utilization (Control and Regulation) Act No. 42 of 1974, Part ILI, para 8.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
supports farm level productivity enhancement for these crops; the National Agricultural and Livestock&#13;
Research Project (NALRP, Cr. 1970-TA) and National Agricultural and Livestock Extension&#13;
Rehabilitation Project (NALERP; Cr. 1994-TA), are supporting the rehabilitation of research and&#13;
extension services, respectively. A Forestry Resources Management Project (Cr. 2335-TA) is improving&#13;
regulation of forestry exploitation and development, as well as providing support for the reformulation of&#13;
Land Tenure Policy, and the strengthening of land tenure administration systems. An Agriculture Sector&#13;
Management Project (Cr. 2537-TA) approved in 1993, supports the rationalization of MOA, the divestiture&#13;
of agricultural parastatals, and the strengthening of the agriculture information system.&#13;
1.46   In the water sector, an IDA credit has been approved in support of urban water supply&#13;
management through the Urban Sector Engineering Project (Cr. 2291-TA). The Bank has not been&#13;
involved to date in supporting irrigation, or in the management of river basins.&#13;
F.    LESSONS FROM PREVIOUS IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.47   IDA has not financed smallholder irrigation in Tanzania to date. OED has recently reviewed&#13;
irrigation projects world-wide10 and recommends that (i) in future the emphasis should be on upgrading&#13;
existing irrigation schemes, increasing the responsiveness of irrigation services, lowering unit costs,&#13;
increasing efficiency and conserving water use, (ii) the assessment of the benefits (and costs) of irrigation&#13;
projects should be broader than direct production returns, and should include effects on health, household&#13;
water supply and dam safety; (iii) project design should give priority to larger, lower unit cost projects, and&#13;
should "exploit the potential synergy between irrigation and catchment improvement"; (iv) supervision&#13;
should focus on construction quality and land acquisition issues; (v) the financing of those&#13;
institutions responsible for 0 &amp; M should be provided directly by the irrigators; (vi) the Bank should foster&#13;
the conditions which create durable and responsible water user groups; (vii) special heed should be paid to&#13;
fostering user involvement in all aspects of irrigation, in simplifying scheme operation, and in&#13;
integrating low lift pumps into surface system design; and (viii) the Bank should continue to stress&#13;
drainage, and finance it. The proposed project responds to the above recommendations. It is focusing on&#13;
upgrading smallholder schemes, and will address basin issues, which are included in the economic analysis.&#13;
H.  THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    RATIONALE&#13;
Rationale for the Project and IDA Involvement&#13;
2.1    Water resource management has become an issue of national importance. It is only in recent years,&#13;
with the rapid increase in the demand for water for hydropower production and irrigation that followed the&#13;
liberalization of economic activity, that water has become scarce in select river basins. The conflict in the&#13;
demand for water can only be resolved through more transparent, structured allocation and control&#13;
mechanisms for basin water resources. The ability of the Water Officer to manage water resources is&#13;
severely constrained by: (i) lack of information on the quantity of surface (and ground) water available (the&#13;
hydrological and meteorological networks are in severe disrepair); (ii) the lack of systematic monitoring of&#13;
water quality (the sampling and analysis systems are in poor shape); (iii) the lack of water control&#13;
structures on many smallholder irrigation schemes; (iv) the lack of funding for the operations of the&#13;
10  World Bank, "A Review of World Bank Experience in Irrigation", Report 13676, November 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
regulatory agencies; (v) the low level of the "economic water user fees" and the inadequacy of penalties for&#13;
pollution and overuse, in the Water Utilization (Control and Regulation) Act of 1974 (and Amendments).&#13;
Environmental and water quality considerations in the management of these two key river basins receive&#13;
minimal attention. Irrigators, environmental concems, livestock herders and other stakeholders have no&#13;
voice in the management of river basin resources.&#13;
2.2    Sectoral Context - Basin Management. In order to redress this situation, the Government, with&#13;
assistance from IDA and other donors has recently carried out a Rapid Water Resources Assessment.1'&#13;
This national exercise brings together all existing information on water resource availability and use by&#13;
river basin, and provides a framework on which to build a strategy for improving integrated water resource&#13;
management in the country. Such an approach is recommended under the recently approved Bank policy&#13;
statement on water resource management. 12 The Rapid Water Resources Assessment confirms and builds&#13;
on work initiated under the UNDP/World Bank funded Sub-Saharan Hydrological Assessment, which&#13;
produced a detailed assessment and recommendations on how to improve basin management in Tanzania.&#13;
A national Water Sector Study was carried out recently by MOW, supported by IDA funds, which sets the&#13;
strategic priorities for water supply system development, linking it to water resource management plans.&#13;
Additional information on water resource availability and irrigation demand management is provided by a&#13;
1995 study of the Ruaha Basin (as sub Basin of the Rufiji) funded by DANIDA and executed through the&#13;
World Bank.'3 These various studies provide a comprehensive view of the situation in the country, and&#13;
indicate the Pangani and the Rufiji as the basins where the need for a comprehensive approach to water&#13;
resources management is greatest. This project responds to these priorities, and seeks to improve&#13;
integrated water resource management in these two basins.&#13;
2.3    The ability to effectively manage increasingly scarce water resources is clearly an issue of high&#13;
priority in Tanzania. This entails:&#13;
-  strengthening the information base of the sector;&#13;
*  rationalizing the mechanism by which water is allocated between competing uses;&#13;
-  increasing the penalties for breaking the law;&#13;
*  strengthening Government's monitoring and enforcement capabilities;&#13;
&#149;  ensuring better coordination between institutions involved in the sector; and&#13;
*  increasing the participation of water users and stakeholders in the management of river basin&#13;
resources.&#13;
This project would support these principles, and strengthen water resource management in two high priority&#13;
basins.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
2.4    Sectoral Context - Irrigation Development. On the irrigation side, the National Irrigation&#13;
Development Plan,14 published in mid-1994, based on many years of studies and pilot operations, provides&#13;
a framework for addressing irrigation-related questions. As noted previously, the Plan's first priority is the&#13;
upgrading of traditional smallholder irrigation schemes, to improve water use efficiency, raise small farmer&#13;
incomes, reduce food insecurity, and improve basin-wide management of the demand for water. This&#13;
project responds to these priorities, and seeks to improve the efficiency of water use in smallholder&#13;
traditional irrigation schemes as a means to both raise smallholder incomes, and improve water resource&#13;
management.&#13;
2.5   IDA can influence policy and investment in the water sector through its involvement in hydropower&#13;
generation and energy management. Hydropower generation is the most lucrative use to which water is&#13;
put, in both the basins under consideration. This use conflicts with the demands of most other users in&#13;
these basins. IDA is involved in the energy sector through its financing of hydropower and gas fired&#13;
energy production in the Sixth Power (Cr. 2489-TA) and the proposed Songo projects, respectively.&#13;
2.6   IDA has been involved for many years in the effort to improve the assessment, and management, of&#13;
Taiizania's water resources. IDA can use its accumulated experience in the field to bring an intemational&#13;
perspective to bear on the issues. IDA is involved at many levels, and across many sectors (energy, urban&#13;
water supply, agriculture) in the regulation and demand management of water resources in Tanzania. It is&#13;
wvell placed to respond to the issues raised above. It has supported national assessments of water and&#13;
related natural resource management, energy and agriculture issues, and will, through this project,&#13;
strengthen the national framework under which water resources will be managed. By strengthening&#13;
national policy formulation and regulatory agencies, it can assist Government in coordinating donor&#13;
involvement in the sector, reducing fragmentation and piecemeal approaches, and obtaining a framework of&#13;
rational and sustainable water resource management.&#13;
B.    OBJECTIVES AND SUMMARY&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
2.7    The objectives of the project are: (i) to strengthen the Government's capacity to manage water&#13;
resources and address water related environmental concerns both at the national level, and in the Rufiji and&#13;
the Pangani river basins; and (ii) improve irrigation efficiency of select smallholder traditional irrigation&#13;
schemes in these tvo basins. In carrying out these objectives, the project would improve stakeholder&#13;
participation in basin management and irrigation scheme operation, and strengthen the institutional,&#13;
regulatony and incentive framework for basin management.&#13;
Project Summary&#13;
2.8    Under the river basin management component, to be implemented by the MOW, the project&#13;
would fund interventions designed to improve water management both at a national level, and in the twvo&#13;
target basins. Activities to be funded include: (i) strengthening national water resources management bv&#13;
reforming the regulatory framework to improve stakeholder participation in river basin management,&#13;
strengthen the water rights concepts and management, increasing penalties and raising fees for water use.&#13;
and improving infornation gathering and analytical capabilities at the national level; (ii) improving both&#13;
the regulatory capabilities, and the information and resource monitoring capabilities at the basin offices m&#13;
Rufiji and Pangani; and (iii) rehabilitating the hydrometric network in the Rufiji and Pangani basins.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
2.9    The second component, the improvement of smallholder irrigation schemes in the Pangani and&#13;
Rufiji Basins would be implemented by MOA following the priorities established in the National Irrigation&#13;
Development Plan. No new schemes would be established under this project, and no virgin areas will be&#13;
opened to irrigation. In those schemes selected for upgrading, the Government would assist in setting up&#13;
farmer organizations, and would provide financing for the improvement of infrastructure to be maintained&#13;
and operated by water-user organizations.&#13;
C.    DETAILED FEATURES&#13;
River Basin Management Component&#13;
2.10   This component (US$10.6 million with contingencies) would improve the national framework for&#13;
comprehensive management of water, and strengthen water management in the Pangani and Rufiji basins --&#13;
the basins where the need for intervention is most critical according to the Rapid Water Resources&#13;
Assessment. Environmental management considerations would receive particular attention in this programn.&#13;
The activities to be funded under this component include:&#13;
Strengthening National Water Resources Management (US$4. 5 million)&#13;
2.11   Policy Framework. The project would seek to improve the national framework for water&#13;
management by (i) funding task forces and studies designed to update water related legislation, (ii)&#13;
strengthening MOW's Water Resources Department; (iii) strengthening the offices of the Principal Water&#13;
Officer and Basin Water Officers (statutory officers); and (iv) funding high priority hydrological studies&#13;
which address national issues. The project would finance the incremental travel and operating costs, per&#13;
diems and consultancies needed to carry out these activities.&#13;
2.12   An important feature of the project will be to finance studies necessary to improve the legislative&#13;
and regulatory framework, and the information systems which underpin rational water management.&#13;
Government is committed to the concept of integrated, participatory river basin management, including:&#13;
*  Adoption of a comprehensive approach to river basin management which considers water as a&#13;
scarce resource, and ensures that interlinkages between the needs of different users (such as&#13;
irrigators, domestic water supply users, industrial users, hydropower generators, and&#13;
environmentally fragile fauna, flora and soils), are taken into consideration in deciding on&#13;
water allocation and management principles.&#13;
*  Participatory planning and decision making for basin water resource management -- ensuring&#13;
systematic involvement of all stakeholders;&#13;
*  Improved analysis and understanding of hydrological and hydrogeological phenomena and their&#13;
interaction with other natural resources (soils and forest cover), as well as water-user needs&#13;
and characteristics, so as to design ever more responsive and effective allocation systems and&#13;
permit more effective incentives for efficient and non-polluting use;&#13;
2.13   The conceptual framework for integrated river basin management is already laid out in the Water&#13;
Utilization (Control and Regulation) Act of 1974, as amended in 1981. However, the legislation has never&#13;
been effectively implemented. The Government has submitted a Letter of Water Resources Management&#13;
Policy outlining measures to be taken to update legislation and improve management of this resource&#13;
(Annex A).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
2.14   Legislative Framework. To improve the legislative framework, it is necessary to refine and&#13;
update certain concepts and certain fines and fees, so that its implementation will produce the desired&#13;
results. The project would finance the incremental travel and operating costs, per diems and consulting&#13;
services needed to support a multidisciplinary Task Force, led by MOW, which would carry out a review&#13;
and lead public discussion of all legislation pertaining to basin water management, during the first two&#13;
years of the project.&#13;
2.15   The two year review of the institutional framework and legislation for water management would&#13;
pick up on four main issues: (i) water rights; (ii) water charges; (iii) protection of water against pollution;&#13;
and (iv) strengthening, and broadening stakeholder participation in the institutional framework for basin&#13;
management. Particular topics to be addressed include:&#13;
*  the strengthening of the "water right" concept by (i) clarifying how the vesting of all water in&#13;
the State, with the Government sanctioning all uses, affects customary water rights exercised&#13;
by riparians or livestock owners or other traditional users, who have not sought, nor been given&#13;
water rights under the law; (ii) clarifying the cases in which the State is entitled to modify or&#13;
withdraw this water right (now very broadly defined, and permitted whenever water is required&#13;
for a "public purpose");&#13;
- the further detailing of the water charges to be collected by the Government for the right to use&#13;
water by (i) clarifying the parameters to be taken into account in the calculation of these&#13;
charges; (ii) differentiating between the charges associated with the application fee, and those&#13;
for "economic water use fees," which it is recommended be redefined as a tax on water use,&#13;
assessed to cover the costs of operation and maintenance of basin monitoring and regulatory&#13;
facilities;&#13;
* giving the Basin Water Office the authority to collect the above mentioned charges, as well as&#13;
the fines assessed for breaking the law, particularly those for exceeding the permissible&#13;
pollution standards or water rights allocations, and utilize them in operating the basin&#13;
monitoring and regulatory system;&#13;
* improving stakeholder participation and voice in the allocation and management of water&#13;
resources by broadening stakeholder representation on the Basin Water Boards, establishing&#13;
democratic methods for stakeholder selection, and strengthening the administrative power of&#13;
the Basin Water Board -- including giving it the responsibility for the final approval of water&#13;
right allocations (or modifications) as proposed by the Basin Water Officer;&#13;
* strengthening the Basin Water Office by (i) enabling the Water Officer to enforce and follow-&#13;
up on existing legislation, regulations and operating rules goveming water use; (ii) establishing&#13;
the Basin Water Board as a prelimninary center for conflict resolution in water allocation; and&#13;
(iii) separating water use management from regulatory activities, following agreement on&#13;
standard operating rules;&#13;
* clarifying laws and regulations pertaining to pollution, including: (i) improving the provisions&#13;
which provide for pollution control, by establishing a prior control of the polluting activities&#13;
and enacting the needed requirements for a suitable permit system for dumping of wastes and&#13;
other effluents into water instead of the "consent" currently required; (ii) providing for&#13;
protection of water against abuse; (iii) strengthening the sanction and fine system by&#13;
establishing much more serious penalties and introducing reference to penalty factors (which&#13;
adjust for inflation), and finally (iv) developing enforcement procedures and means.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
2.16   It was agreed that the Ministry of Water would make recommendations to Cabinet on revisions&#13;
to the National Water Policy by June 30, 1998. Upon approval by Cabinet, the changes in the policy&#13;
would lead to revisions in the basic legislation. It was agreed that draft legislation will be presented to&#13;
Parliament, amending the Water Utilization (Control and Regulation) Act of 1974 to include revised&#13;
elements of the National Water Policy by December 31, 1998 (para 6. 1.a).&#13;
2.17   Prior to the formal initiation of the project, first steps would be taken to adjust the framework for&#13;
basin management, to strengthen the incentives for improving user efficiency, reducing pollution. First&#13;
steps would be taken to broaden stakeholder representation in basin management. These initial adjustments&#13;
represent changes to current regulations and appointments under the existing legislation which are within&#13;
the authority of the Minister for Water. As agreed at negotiations, the Govermment has recently taken steps&#13;
to (i) broaden stakeholder representation in Basin Water Boards to include elected private sector&#13;
representatives of irrigators, environmental concerns and town dwellers, and (ii) to put the statutory Basin&#13;
Offices on a financially autonomous basis. Subsequent to studies, funded under the project, to be&#13;
undertaken in the first half of 1996, it was agreed that Government will, by December 31, 1996, revise&#13;
existing regulations so as to increase the water use fee to a level sufficient to cover operating costs of the&#13;
river basin offices, and raise pollution fines sufficiently high to provide a strong incentive to reduce&#13;
pollution (para 6.1.b).&#13;
2.18   Strengthening the Water Resource Department, and the Office of the Principal Water&#13;
Officer. Under the Commissioner for Water Affairs, the Water Resources Departrnent of MOW, which&#13;
contains the Hydrological and Hydrogeological Services Sections, is charged with monitoring water&#13;
availability and use across the country. With offices at the Regional level, it administers the basin&#13;
networks, it gathers the information and forwards it to the central office in Dar es Salaam for analysis.&#13;
Water quality samples, collected at the regional level by the Water Resources Department are sent to the&#13;
central Operations and Maintenance Department for analysis. With the increased awareness of water&#13;
related issues (scarcity, seasonal variation, quality), and the increase in responsibilities and the volume of&#13;
activity to be carried out under the proposed project, there is a need to review the functions and&#13;
organization of this department, and restructure its activities. The project will support this process, and&#13;
fund the training and other expenses needed to set the departmnent on a new footing. It was agreed that the&#13;
proposalfor the revisions in the structure andfunctions of the Water Resources Department will be&#13;
provided to the Bankfor review by June 30, 1997, and that the agreed restructuring and rationalization&#13;
plan be implemented by December 31, 1997 (para 6.1.c). The project would support the strengthening of&#13;
the department, with the provision of specialized equipment needed to improve monitoring capabilities at&#13;
the national level, as well as vehicles, training and technical assistance. Where necessary, specialized staff&#13;
would be contracted to provide support services to the department to permit it to carry out its&#13;
responsibilities under this project (para 3.9).&#13;
2.19   The Principal Water Officer is the person charged, under the Water Utilization (Control and&#13;
Regulation) Act of 1974 with authorizing water rights, collecting the various charges, assessing fines for&#13;
pollution, and carrying out the provisions of the law. This power is exercised for basins designated as&#13;
being of "national" importance by the MOW. These responsibilities are delegated, in the case of the&#13;
Pangani and Rufiji basins, to the Basin Water Officers. The project would strengthen Government's&#13;
regulatory functions in the water sector by providing equipment, training and technical assistance to the&#13;
offices of the Principal Water Officer and the Basin Water Officers in the Pangani and Rufiji basins.&#13;
2.20   Special Studies. The project would also finance a series of special studies on key aspects of the&#13;
policy and legislative framework, river basin modeling, and environmental and natural resource&#13;
management. The studies of the legislative framework have been described above. In addition, there will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
be studies of features of these two basins which are of importance to basin hydrology and the environment.&#13;
Of these features, the most important is the Utengule Swamp15 in the Great Ruaha sub-basin, which&#13;
provides a large wetland habitat for wildlife, regulates the flow of the Great Ruaha river, and improves the&#13;
quality of the water flowing out of the Usangu Plain and into the Mtera Reservoir. Also of importance, for&#13;
similar reasons, are the swamps at Pawaga and at Mafinga, on the Little Ruaha, which will be studied&#13;
under the programn.&#13;
2.21   Another topic to be studied will be issues surrounding natural resource management in the Great&#13;
Ruaha sub-basin, given the mounting tension between pastoralists, farmers and other inhabitants of the&#13;
area (para 1.32).&#13;
2.22   In the context of improving river basin management and improving the allocation of scarce water&#13;
during the dry season, an issue which will receive further attention under the project is the question of&#13;
regulating water use and assessing the environmental impact of the various State Farms and Government&#13;
owned farming enterprises engaged in large-scale irrigation in both basins.&#13;
2.23   Strengthening Water Quality Monitoring. The project would strengthen the national water&#13;
quality monitoring network to carry out three activities: (i) point source effluent monitoring, (ii) non-point&#13;
source monitoring, (iii) monitoring of ambient conditions, and (iv) groundwater monitoring. The project&#13;
would bring in expertise in water quality monitoring, to devise ways to strengthen the existing program.&#13;
The project would also focus initially on improving the situation in the Pangani and Rufiji river basins, by&#13;
supporting the replacement or upgrading of equipment and facilities in the MOW's laboratories in Iringa&#13;
and Tanga, which serve the two river basins. The facilities in the central laboratory should be improved to&#13;
ensure quality control of the regional laboratories. Finally, the portions of the Moshi laboratory which still&#13;
need to be constructed would be completed and equipped with the necessary equipment. During the project,&#13;
the costs of carrying out the laboratory analysis necessary to monitor water quality would be supported by&#13;
the project. The level of analysis to be supported would cover primary monitoring (physical characteristics&#13;
of water, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, sediment, etc.) up to the monitoring of heavy metals. More&#13;
expensive analysis (on the presence of pesticides and fertilizers) would be carried out sporadically, under&#13;
contract in foreign labs. The project would finance civil works, vehicles and equipment, incremental&#13;
operating costs (including water sample analysis costs), per diems, and technical assistance as needed.&#13;
Strengthening Basin Management (US$5.8 million)&#13;
2.24   In addition to strengthening water monitoring and management capabilities at the national level, the&#13;
project would focus on the problems in two key basins: the Pangani and the Rufiji. Under this component,&#13;
the project would strengthen both the statutory (regulatory) functions of the Basin Water Offices, their&#13;
information collecting and development activities, and improve the quality of the hydrometric network.&#13;
2.25   Basin Office Strengthening. The project would provide the Water Resources Department and&#13;
Basin Water Office staff at the basin and regional level with training, vehicles and equipment, to enable&#13;
them to operate the above-mentioned network, collecting, analyzing and forwarding data related to water&#13;
availability and use.&#13;
2.26   Hydrometric Network Rehabilitation and Upgrading.  In order to regulate water use and carry&#13;
out their mandate under water legislation, MOW and the Basin Water Offices require accurate, timely&#13;
15  ODA has expressed an interest in funding the study of the Utengule Swamp, which is linked to their work in&#13;
the Ruaha National Park.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
information on water quantity and quality at various points in the basin. The information available at&#13;
present is often inaccurate, and collection systems are weak. The project would rehabilitate the 5 existing&#13;
networks in the Pangani and the Rufiji Basins in order to permit the following types of measurement:&#13;
hydrological, meteorological, groundwater, water quality, and sediment. During the course of the project,&#13;
the existing network of monitoring stations would be assessed, and upgraded and expanded as necessary to&#13;
improve monitoring of key areas currently not covered (particularly the Kilombero and Rufiji valleys of the&#13;
Rufiji Basin). Preliminary surveys of the current network have shown that in the Rufiji there are 65&#13;
hydrometric stations (maintained by the MOW), of which 24 are in the primary network (8 in good&#13;
condition) and 35 in the secondary network (10 in good condition), and 6 are in the local network. In the&#13;
Pangani there are 44 hydrometric stations, of which 16 are in the primary network (3 in good condition), 24&#13;
are in the secondary network (with 20 working), and 4 are local stations. The project would finance&#13;
vehicles, equipment and the incremental operating costs necessary to rehabilitate and operate the system.&#13;
Smallholder Irrigation Improvement&#13;
2.27          This component (US$20.3 million with contingencies) would target low income&#13;
smallholder farmers within selected traditional irrigation schemes, in order to improve scheme management&#13;
and upgrade scheme infrastructure. 16 Better water management and higher quality infrastructure will&#13;
permit an increase in water use efficiency, and enable significant improvements in access to and&#13;
distribution of water in such schemes. It is envisioned that some 25-30 schemes covering around 7,000 ha&#13;
(averaging some 250 ha each) would receive infrastructural improvement over the six years of project&#13;
implementation. The objectives of this component are to:&#13;
* Support comprehensive river basin management by improving management of the demand for&#13;
irrigation water;&#13;
* Improve water use efficiency;&#13;
* Increase crop yields and scheme productivity, improving small farrner incomes and reducing&#13;
susceptibility to drought; and&#13;
* Reduce the Government's involvement in smallholder traditional irrigation to a more "hands&#13;
off' approach, providing guidance and technical assistance with water user formation and&#13;
scheme operations, and providing funding and coordination and specification of design and&#13;
construction where justified;&#13;
2.28   The project would follow the priorities and guidelines put forward in the National Irrigation&#13;
Development Plan. The Governnent has outlined measures to be taken in support of irrigated agriculture&#13;
in the Statement of Irrigation Development Policy (Annex B).&#13;
Participatory Scheme Selection and Management (US$2.4 million with contingencies)&#13;
2.29   The objective of this sub-component is to work with the targeted traditional smallholder irrigation&#13;
schemes, to improve scheme management and bring them to a position where they can make use of the&#13;
infrastructural improvements offered under the project. The activities would be carried out by five&#13;
multidisciplinary teams in the MOA Irrigation Department. During the project preparation phase,&#13;
interdisciplinary teams visited and interviewed all the irrigation schemes in the Pangani Basin and in the&#13;
16 Working Paper by A.Elahi, "Rehabilitating/Upgrading Irrigation Infrastructure for Improving Network&#13;
Efficiency and Operations," November 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
Great Ruaha sub-basin of the Rufiji. From these, a list of schemes which meet the criteria for inclusion in&#13;
the project will be selected for fuirther work. The approach will be to invest in organizing water users and&#13;
improving scheme management in the list of schemes which meet the initial criteria. Not all schemes on&#13;
the initial list would receive project funded assistance with infrastructure. Those schemes which meet the&#13;
technical criteria, where the communities are responsive and where there is evidence of a strong community&#13;
commitment to improving water user management and contributing to scheme upgrading, would be&#13;
approved for further technical studies. These studies, and the design of infrastructure improvements, would&#13;
be carried out in consultation with the communities. Procedures are spelled out further in para 3.12. It&#13;
was agreed that feasibility studies in a given community would not be initiated until the community had&#13;
met the criteria for receiving such assistance (para 6. 1. d).&#13;
2.30   The project would finance the cost of five interdisciplinary teams from the Irrigation Department,&#13;
deployed in the two basins to carry out the work described above in the selected schemes. These teams&#13;
would establish or strengthen, as appropriate, the water user organizations and enable the farmers in the&#13;
scheme to make use of the support which the project can provide. Teams would, where appropriate,&#13;
support formation of savings and credit cooperatives, to facilitate provision of credit for productive&#13;
activities in the region. Project funding would cover the cost of vehicles, equipment, training costs, and&#13;
incremental operating expenses.&#13;
2.31   An important feature of the project will be its activities designed to strengthen community&#13;
organizations and their ability to manage improved irrigation schemes -- including improving the benefits&#13;
which accrue to women from the improvements in irrigation. The approach developed in the Women in&#13;
Agriculture Project, currently under implementation by FAO, would be supported under the project. The&#13;
project would also explore the possibility of contracting a portion of the community development work to&#13;
NGOs who may have a regional or functional comparative advantage in such activities.&#13;
Engineering Works on Schemes (US$15.2 million with contingencies)&#13;
2.32   This subcomponent would provide Government finance for the cost of the civil works on&#13;
smallholder schemes necessary to improve irrigation infrastructure, and irrigation efficiency. Due to&#13;
inefficiencies in local financial markets, and the targeted, poverty alleviation objectives of this program, the&#13;
Government would continue to be involved in the financing of irrigation improvement works. The project&#13;
would improve a total of 7,000 ha over six years, reaching an equivalent number of farm families in some&#13;
25 to 30 schemes in the two target river basins. The construction phase would follow the initial scheme&#13;
identification phase and the subsequent work with the water user organizations of the initial list of schemes.&#13;
Under the overall control of the MOA Irrigation Department, the actual design, construction, and&#13;
supervision of construction of the improved infrastructure, would be carried out by private sector&#13;
consulting firms and contractors. The Government, through the project, will contribute, as a grant to the&#13;
farmers participating in the selected irrigation scheme, some 80 percent of the total cost of the civil works&#13;
to improve irrigation infrastructure. The smallholder farmers in the scheme would be required to contribute&#13;
the remaining 20 percent. The farmers' contribution, mainly through labor and local construction&#13;
materials, would involve reconstruction and improvement of select tertiary canals and on farm water&#13;
distribution works (field canals, field drains, land leveling). The total cost of infrastructure improvements&#13;
has been estimated to be between US$1,500 and US$2,000 per ha. Actual costs per ha, will vary across&#13;
projects due to the differences in topography, rehabilitation requirements, and irrigation system design&#13;
imposed by site specific considerations. The project would finance the cost of the civil works carried out&#13;
by independent contractors and associated design and supervision charges. It was agreed that in a given&#13;
community IDA financing for civil works for improving irrigation infrastructure would not be provided&#13;
until a formal contract had been signed between the organization representing the community and the&#13;
Government, setting out the rights and responsibilities of each party to the investment. Each of such&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
contracts would specify the responsibility of the community for construction of tertiary canals and on&#13;
farm distribution works, andfor operation and maintenance of the improved scheme (para 6.3.a).&#13;
Mitigation of Negative Environmental Effects (US$0.7 million with contingencies)&#13;
2.33   This sub-component would create a capacity to conduct environmental evaluations of irrigation&#13;
schemes proposed for support under this and other similar donor-assisted projects in MOA's Department of&#13;
Irrigation. A four-person cell would be established during the first year of the project consisting of an&#13;
envirounental specialist, a social scientist, an irrigation specialist, and a rural technologist. The&#13;
responsibilities of this cell would include: (i) the development of screening criteria in conformity with&#13;
national and Bank environmental policies to assess candidate schemes for environmental issues; (ii) the&#13;
conduct of initial environmental evaluations for each scheme to include the identification of relevant&#13;
mitigation measures where warranted to be integrated in project design during the feasibility studies; (iii)&#13;
preparation of terms of reference for and supervision of environmental impact assessments (where needed);&#13;
(iv) supervision of environmental features of the rehabilitation work and identification of environmentally&#13;
appropriate water management technologies; (v) monitoring of environmental quality following completion&#13;
of the construction phase; and (vi) serving as liaison to the Regional Water Basin Offices, the Division of&#13;
Environment in the Vice President's Office and the National Environment Management Council.&#13;
Irrigation Sector Capacity Building (US$1.9 million with contingencies)&#13;
2.34   The objective of this activity is to strengthen the capability in the public and private sector to carry&#13;
out successful smallholder irrigation development. The project would support the rationalization of the&#13;
Irrigation Department, to be designed and implemented under the Agriculture Sector Management Project.&#13;
Under the proposed component, funds would be provided (covering the incremental operating costs of the&#13;
five multidisciplinary field teams) to ensure that the 'core' functions for which the Irrigation Department is&#13;
responsible will be effectively carried out. The Government would play a larger role in the formation and&#13;
strengthening of water user associations, and would withdraw to a supervisory and guidance role with&#13;
regard to construction and rehabilitation of irrigation works. The staff mix in the Irrigation Department&#13;
would be diversified and strengthened (through hiring, contracting and seconding mechanisms as well as by&#13;
in-service training) so as to build five multidisciplinary teams capable of dealing effectively with the wide&#13;
range of activities essential to ensure the establishment of profitable and sustainable systems of smallholder&#13;
irrigation. These activities would encompass, among others: scheme design, monitoring and evaluation,&#13;
creating water user groups, and establishing appropriate and environmentally and economically sound&#13;
water management and agronomic techniques. Training would be provided to private sector contractors on&#13;
the technical features of the construction of irrigation works, and in the use of labor-based construction&#13;
methods. Importantly, team members (from the Irrigation Department) would require the skills and&#13;
capacity to work in the field to assist farmers and their associations to implement recommended procedures&#13;
and where necessary to devise appropriate modifications to them. Through the multidisciplinary field&#13;
teams Government would work with water user groups (possibly formalized Water User Cooperatives in&#13;
the case of improved schemes) to define and administer water use charges. Such charges would be&#13;
graduated to cover operation and maintenance costs and the basin water use fees (para 4.14).&#13;
Implementation of the irrigation component is described further in paras 3.10 through 3.12.&#13;
2.35   Irrigation Agronomy.  The returns to the investment in irrigation hinge on the improvement of&#13;
on farm water management and the adoption of improved production techniques and varieties. Funding for&#13;
rice research is extremely limited under the existing research program (funded by various donors, including&#13;
IDA in the National Agriculture and Livestock Research Project Cr. 1970-TA). The project would&#13;
remedy this by providing funds within the national framework for financing research, in order to increase&#13;
resources devoted to rice research under the National Research Program. The research would be carried&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
out under the direction of the National Rice Research Program, headquartered at Ifakara. Research funded&#13;
by the project would be on a contract basis, with funds directed to resolving issues already identified as&#13;
impediments to the development of sustainable and profitable systems of smallholder irrigation in the two&#13;
basins that are not adequately covered in ongoing agricultural research programs. In particular such&#13;
research would focus on the problems of irrigated rice cultivation in the Great Ruaha sub-basin where&#13;
rainfall and hydrological conditions are less favorable than in the Pangani Basin. A high level research&#13;
agronomist would be brought in once a year to help define the contract research program, and review&#13;
progress in carrying it out.&#13;
2.36   Agricultural extension in irrigated areas would be funded under existing and planned Bank projects&#13;
that support the national agricultural extension program (NALERP Cr. 1994-TA and the proposed NAEP&#13;
II project). It was agreed that in order to support technology transfer, the Borrower shall ensure, that&#13;
until completion of the project, MOA shall provide adequate agricultural extension agents to support&#13;
technology transfer in the irrigated areas in the Rufiji and Pangani River Basins (para 6.1. e). The higher&#13;
level agronomy staff in the Irrigation Department would be provided with intensive training in irrigated&#13;
agronomy and water management, to enable them to guide and train the front line staff and to serve as a&#13;
link to research, as well as participating in the multidisciplinary teams. Government policy is that, to the&#13;
extent possible, agricultural extension activities should be funded by those who benefit from their&#13;
assistance. If an irrigation scheme is successful, the water user cooperatives or associations should be&#13;
encouraged to adopt responsive extension staff, and incorporate them into the scheme. Possibilities for&#13;
encouraging this process would be investigated during the Mid-Term Review for this project.&#13;
D.    PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
2.37   The total cost of the project is estimated at US$30.7 million. Baseline costs are estimated at&#13;
US$27.4 million, with physical contingencies estimated at US$2.0 million and price contingencies at&#13;
US$1.3 million. Cost estimates exclude taxes and duties as Government imports and other Government&#13;
expenditures for projects such as this are normally exempted from taxes and duties. Cost estimates were&#13;
made in June 1995, during appraisal. The base exchange rate was Tsh 550 for one US dollar. The&#13;
distribution of local and foreign costs by component and subcomponent, is shown below:&#13;

2.38    Contingencies. Physical contingencies vary between 5 and 10 percent, depending on the&#13;
expenditure item. On price contingencies, it is estimated that international inflation, taken from projections&#13;
of the Bank's MUV" index, will vary between 1.6 and 2.4 percent per annum, over the next six years, as&#13;
noted below. Local inflation estimates are also shown below. It is assumed that the exchange rate would&#13;
adjust to compensate for differences between local and international inflation.&#13;

2.39    Financing. IDA would finance 85 percent of total project costs with a credit of US$26.3 million.&#13;
Farmers contributions towards the construction of their irrigation works, estimated at 20 percent of the&#13;
total value of the construction program to improve irrigation infrastructure, will account for US$3.0&#13;
million, or 10 percent of total project costs. The Government, due to severe shortages of budget funds, will&#13;
provide US$1.5 million (5 percent of project costs) in support of project activities executed by its own&#13;
agencies over the next six years, or some US$250,000 a year. Recent reviews of the budgets of the MOA&#13;
and MOW indicate that this is a feasible amount. Over the course of the project, it is foreseen that a share&#13;
of the operating cost of supporting river basin regulation and monitoring activities wrill come directly from&#13;
taxes (or water use fees) paid by water users and assessed on actual water use (para 2.17).&#13;

E.    PROCUREMENT&#13;
2.40   Those entities responsible for procurement under the project will be (i) the Water Resources&#13;
Department under MOW, for goods and services for the river basin management component, and vii) the&#13;
Irrigation Department under MOA, for goods and services for the smallholder irrigation improvement&#13;
component. A local specialist in financial management and procurement will be brought into each&#13;
department, on contract, to manage the procurement process, and set up the financial system, for the first&#13;
three years of the project when the workload and level of complexity will be the greatest. This person is&#13;
now in place in MOW under PPF funding. Procurement of works, goods and services for all IDA-financed&#13;
components shall be in accordance with the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA&#13;
Credits," published January 1995. Consultants shall be engaged in accordance with the "Guidelines for&#13;
Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as an Executing Agency," published&#13;
August 1981 . Bank Standard Bidding and Contract documents shall be used for all ICB and consultant&#13;
contracts.&#13;
2.41   Works. The Category of Works includes civil works for rehabilitation, improvement or upgrading&#13;
of the irrigation schemes and all appurtenant infrastructure, including environmental protection works, land&#13;
development, building and offices, as well as works associated with the installation of river basin&#13;
hydrometric network in the River Basin Management component. Civil Works contracts for the irrigation&#13;
schemes, related infrastructure and environmental protection would be grouped to the extent possible within&#13;
the Procurement Plan and would be subject to Intemational Competitive Bidding (ICB) for contracts&#13;
estimated at value greater than US$500,000. Civil works contracts estimated to cost equivalent of&#13;
US$500,000 or less per contract up to an aggregate amount of US$9.5 million may be procured through&#13;
contracts awarded on the basis of National Competitive Bidding (NCB), in accordance with the procedures&#13;
satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
2.42   Institutional, environmental and feasibility studies, detailed engineering designs including,&#13;
preparation of bidding documents and construction supervision would be carried out by consultants to be&#13;
employed by the respective implementing agencies, whose qualifications, experience and terms and&#13;
conditions of employment shall be satisfactory to IDA."8 Contracts for the recruitment of consultants&#13;
would be awarded following Bank guidelines (Guidelines for the use of Consultants: August 1981). Local&#13;
and foreign experts may be recruited in specialized fields to assist in basin management, irrigation&#13;
management, environment, finance and training. No salaries will be funded under the project. Where staff&#13;
are engaged in project related field work, personnel allowances (per diems) will be paid using Government&#13;
approved standards. No sitting allowances will be paid.&#13;
2.43   Goods. Procurement of vehicles and equipment wherever practicable, shall be combined into&#13;
single contract(s) of US$100,000 or more and would be procured through ICB. Furniture, office&#13;
Is  The use of Standard Form of Contract for Consultants' Services (published by the World Bank in June 1995)&#13;
shall be obligatory.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
cquipment and supplies (part of operating costs) would be procured under NCB procedures for contracts&#13;
cstimated to cost less than US$100,000 up to a total of US$800,000. Contracts on such goods, estimated&#13;
to cost less than US$50,000 may be procured using national shopping, up to an aggregate arnount of&#13;
US$600,000. All contracts with a value of US$100,000 or more shall be subject to prior review and&#13;
clcarance by IDA (see para 2.45).&#13;

2.45    Prior Review Procedures and Reporting. The Annual Workplan prepared each year by the&#13;
implementing agencies for review by IDA (para 3.7) shall include details of the items to be procured (goods&#13;
and services) and the procedures to be adopted for such procurement within the limits given earlier and to&#13;
be agreed by IDA. Requirements for IDA's prior review of procurement are as follows:&#13;
(i)     Procurement of Goods, and Civil Works Contracts: Invitation for bidding, draft bidding&#13;
documents, bid evaluation and award recommendations, for all contracts exceeding&#13;
US$100,000 for each contract, would all be subject to prior review and no objection by&#13;
IDA;&#13;
(ii)    Contracts with Consulting Firms and Individual Consultants (Technical Assistance&#13;
Personnel): Terms of reference for all consultant services would be subject to prior review&#13;
and approval by IDA. When the estimated value of the contract exceeds US$100,000 for&#13;
consulting firms and US$50,000 for individuals, shortlist(s), budgets, selection procedures&#13;
and criteria, letters of invitation, evaluation reports and contracts, shall all be subject to&#13;
prior review and approval by IDA. All sole source contracts shall be subject to prior&#13;
review and clearance by IDA.&#13;
(iii)    Expenses on training shall be subject to IDA's prior review and clearance.&#13;
19   Value in parenthesis indicates IDA financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
(iv)   Contracts below the prior review threshold would be subject to ex-post review by IDA on&#13;
a selected basis (one in five).&#13;
F.    DISBURSEMENT&#13;
2.46   The proposed IDA Credit of SDR 17.6 million would be disbursed over seven years with an&#13;
expected Project Completion Date of June 30, 2002 and a Closing Date of December 31, 2002. The&#13;
schedule of estimated disbursements is based on the cost tables (Annex G).&#13;
2.47   Disbursement Procedures. Disbursements from the Credit would be in accordance with the&#13;
normal IDA procedures set out in the Disbursement Handbook (November 1992). Once agreement has&#13;
been reached on the annual work program and budgets with the implementing agencies (MOW and MOA),&#13;
disbursements from the credit can be made following the standard procedures, including: reimbursement of&#13;
expenses incurred by MOW and MOA against submission of disbursement requests, direct payment to&#13;
suppliers or replenishment of Special Accounts.&#13;
2.48   To facilitate disbursement, IDA will advance funds into two Special Accounts, one for each&#13;
component. IDA will advance the sum of US$500,000 for the River Basin Management Component,&#13;
managed by MOW, into a Special Account in convertible currency opened in a commercial bank&#13;
acceptable to IDA. For the Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Component, managed by MOA, a sum of&#13;
US$ 1,000,000 will be advanced into a Special Account in convertible currency to be opened with a&#13;
commercial bank acceptable to IDA. Appropriate Special Accounts have already been opened for the&#13;
administration of the Project Preparation Facility. Upon effectiveness the advance amounts will be&#13;
deposited to the respective Special Account against disbursement application(s). Reimbursements should&#13;
be grouped for replenishment of these Special Accounts and submitted for reimbursement every month or&#13;
whenever the Special Account balances are reduced to one-third of the original amount, whichever comes&#13;
first, through the standard channel of disbursement procedures for the Special Accounts. The account may&#13;
be used to pay for expenditures in either local or foreign currencies through the commercial banking&#13;
system, against any category of expenditure. All replenishments should be fully documented except in the&#13;
case where statements of expenditure (SOEs) are authorized.&#13;
2.49   The project implementation agencies in MOW and MOA may claim reimbursements on the basis&#13;
of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) for:&#13;
(i)    Civil works costing less than US$100,000 equivalent.&#13;
(ii)    Goods costing less than US$100,000 equivalent.&#13;
(iii)   Training, consultants contracts, studies and operating costs for single items costing less&#13;
than US$100,000 equivalent for firms, and less than US$50,000 for individuals.&#13;
2.50   The respective implementing agency shall retain all the relevant supporting documentation for&#13;
reimbursements of SOEs for inspection by IDA. During the course of the annual audit of the Project&#13;
Accounts, the auditors shall certify that all expenditures claimed under SOE, have been properly incurred&#13;
for the project.&#13;

2.5 1   The disbursement categories for the IDA credit are presented in Table 5 above. Immediately on&#13;
effectiveness, the advances made under the PPF will be refinanced under the IDA credit.&#13;
G.   ACCOUNTING AND AUDITS&#13;
2.52    The Government would maintain separate records and financial accounts for the project, using&#13;
generally accepted accounting principles. A set of consolidated project financial accounts would be&#13;
prepared for each of the two components. Responsibility for preparation of the component accounts would&#13;
rest with the financial controller appointed for this purpose under each component (one in MOW, one in&#13;
MOA). The financial controller for each component would be located in the office of the component&#13;
coordinator. A financial controller is in place in MOW, and will shortly be contracted in MOA. It was&#13;
agreed that the accounts for each of the two main components would be audited by independent auditors&#13;
satisfactory to IDA. A certified copy of the accounts for each component, together with the auditors&#13;
management report, would be submitted to IDA within six months of the end of the financial year. The&#13;
certificate would include a statement covering the adequacy of the records and accounts used to support&#13;
disbursements against Statements of Expenditure (para 6. 1.g).&#13;
MII. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.   MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE&#13;
3.1     The project would be implemented through the existing line structure of the two lead ministries: the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives and the Ministry of Water. The Water Resources Department in&#13;
the MOW would take the lead in the implementation of the River Basin Management component, with the&#13;
active participation of the Principal and Basin Water Officers. The Irrigation Department in the MOA&#13;
would take the lead in the implementation of the Smallholder Irrigation Improvement component, with the&#13;
active participation of the agricultural research and extension services. No special management units would&#13;
be created within these departments. Rather, they would be strengthened to enable them to discharge their&#13;
normal functions with greater effectiveness and dispatch. Both departments are likely to be restructured in&#13;
the course of the project, as part of Civil Service Reform Program, designed to streamline Government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
These changes would reflect national priorities, and would be part and parcel of changes in the parent&#13;
ministry.&#13;
3.2   Interministerial Coordination. An objective of the project is to improve the coordinated&#13;
assessment, and management, of the water and other natural resources in the country, with special&#13;
emphasis on two key basins: the Pangani and the Rufiji. The water law provides for Central and Basin&#13;
Water Boards, and the Principal and Basin Water Officers whose function it is to regulate and monitor&#13;
water availability and use, across all sectors. The office of the Principal Water Officer, and the offices of&#13;
the Basin Water Officers in the two target basins would receive assistance under the project. However, for&#13;
the purpose and duration of the project, to ensure coordinated action between the two main ministries on&#13;
project activities, a 14 person Interministerial Steering Committee would be established, chaired by the PS,&#13;
(MOW), with the PS, (MOA) as the alternate chair. Membership would also include the Permanent&#13;
Secretaries of the Ministries of Finance, Tourism and Natural Resources, Justice and Constitutional&#13;
Affairs, Community Development, Women and Children, the Planning Commission, and the Vice&#13;
President's Office would also be members. The Regional Development Directors (RDDs) for Iringa and&#13;
Tanga would also be members, in their capacity as chairmen of the Rufiji Basin Technical Committee and&#13;
the Pangani Basin Technical Committee. Membership would also include the RDD for the Coast Region,&#13;
as well as the Commissioners for Water Affairs (MOW), Agriculture and Livestock Development (MOA)&#13;
and the Principal Water Officer (MOW). It was agreed during negotiations that the Assistant&#13;
Commissioners for Irrigation (MOA) and Water Resources (MOW) would be the Secretaries to the&#13;
Interministerial Committee, in their capacity as managers of the two main project components. The&#13;
Committee would meet at least once a year to review and approve the Annual Workplan, to review progress&#13;
to date, to resolve any disputes across ministries, and sanction any major initiatives under the project.&#13;
3.3   In order to facilitate interministerial coordination on a regular basis, a smaller 6-10 person&#13;
Technical Steering Committee would be constituted at the commissioner level, chaired by the&#13;
Commissioner for Water Affairs (MOW), with the Commissioner for Agriculture and Livestock&#13;
Development (MOA) as the alternate chair, and would include the Commissioner for Planning and&#13;
Marketing (MOA), the Principal Water Officer (MOW), the Director of Planning (MOW), and the&#13;
Assistant Commissioners for Water Resources (MOW) and Irrigation (MOA). This committee would meet&#13;
every six months, with additional meetings as needed, to prepare the Annual Workplans, coordinate&#13;
surveys, procurement, training and other joint activities, and resolve disputes.&#13;
3.4    At the basin level, a 10- 1 5 member Basin Technical Committee would be set up for each of the two&#13;
target basins to participate in the formulation of the annual workplan and facilitate implementation of&#13;
project activities. These committees would be chaired by the RDD for Iringa (Rufiji Basin) and for Tanga&#13;
(Pangani Basin), and would include the key officials for the regions, zones and districts in the basin&#13;
(RDDs, RALDOs, ZIEs, RWEs, DC's), a representative from the Department of the Environment in the&#13;
Vice President's office, and the appropriate Basin Water Officer. The Assistant Commissioner for Water&#13;
Resource Development (MOW) would be the secretary to both basin committees, with the Assistant&#13;
Commissioner for Irrigation (MOA) as the alternate. This committee would meet on a quarterly basis, or&#13;
as needed, to contribute to the preparation of the Annual Workplan, monitor implementation of the Annual&#13;
Workplan, resolve cross-sectoral and political problems within the region, coordinate cross-sectoral&#13;
activities and support project implementation. It was agreed that, prior to credit effectiveness, the&#13;
Interministerial Committee, the Technical Committee and the Basin Technical Committees will have been&#13;
established and an Implementation Plan will have been submittedfor each component (para 6.2.).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
Implementation Plans and Annual Workplans&#13;
3.5   The project supports the core functions of the Water Resources Department in MOA and the&#13;
Irrigation Department in MOA. The Government has conceptualized and prepared the project proposal&#13;
itself, using staff from the concemed departments in MOW and MOA. IDA has supported this process&#13;
with a two tranche Project Preparation Facility of US$2.0 million (PPF 906-TA). The initial stages of&#13;
implementation are underway. The two Government teams who will imnplement the project are already&#13;
constituted. Staff are drawn from the normal complement of these departments. Using financing from the&#13;
PPF, the MOA (Irrigation Department) has concluded a census of all irrigation schemes in the two target&#13;
basins (Pangani and Ruaha) and, applying agreed criteria, has identified the top 40 schemes which would&#13;
be targeted for initial assistance. The five multidisciplinary MOA field teams, which would lead in the&#13;
initial social and technical aspects of the project, have carried out the survey. These teams, recently trained&#13;
in participatory assessment techniques, will be responsible for future field work. The next stage of the&#13;
startup phase will be to prepare feasibility studies for four of the most representative, top ranked pilot&#13;
schemes. This exercise, carried out in conjunction with a consulting firm will provide detailed models on&#13;
how to proceed on the participatory design and engineering aspects of the component. This information&#13;
will be compiled into an Implementation Plan for the Irrigation Component.&#13;
3.6    The basin management team (in MOW's Water Resources Department) has completed a&#13;
preliminary survey of the hydrological network, as well as a further assessment of the status of the water&#13;
quality monitoring capabilities. Basic hydrological data is being computerized in order to make it available&#13;
for future modeling exercises. A consulting firm joined forces with the project team in February to develop&#13;
a preliminary hydrological model of the basin, and to formulate detailed programs for rehabilitation of the&#13;
hydrometric network, the management of information, the strengthening of the regulatory system and the&#13;
operation of a water rights registry. As with the Irrigation Component, this work will lead to the&#13;
formulation of a detailed Implementation Plan for the Basin Management Component. The assessment of&#13;
water availability, and water use, coupled with further detailed work on recurrent cost requirements for&#13;
management of the basin, will result in recommendations for increases in the water use fees and pollution&#13;
fines (para 2.17). It was agreed that the submission to IDA of an Implementation Plan for each&#13;
component would be a condition of effectiveness for the project (para 6.2b).&#13;
3.7    The activities, targets, budgets and implernentation mechanisms for each year would be spelled out&#13;
in an Annual Workplan. In addition, the plan would spell out the justification for the proposed program,&#13;
and how it responds to the criteria for project implementation set forth in the Development Credit&#13;
Agreement and supporting documents. Two Annual Workplans would be prepared, one for each&#13;
component. The workplans would include the identification of any staff to receive international training&#13;
during the year. The workplans would also list all proposed purchases of civil works or goods, and identify&#13;
quantities, estimated cost, and procurement method. These workplans would be approved by the&#13;
Interninisterial Committee, and would form the basis for the preparation of the relevant section of the&#13;
Development Budget for each ministry. It was agreed that the Annual Workplan for each component&#13;
would be provided to the Association for comment by April 30 of each year, prior to submission to the&#13;
Interministerial Committee. Final versions of the annual workplans, approved by the Interministerial&#13;
Committee, would be provided to IDA by June 30 of each year (para 6.1. h).&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
3.8    Each of the two departments charged with leading project implementation would prepare progress&#13;
reports on their components every six months, providing information on achievement of the targets&#13;
specified in the Annual Workplan. Using participatory assessment techniques, each department would&#13;
assess the impact and achievements of the project, at the village level every two years. In order to assess&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
progress and provide for any mid-course corrections which may be necessary, a Mid-Term review would be&#13;
scheduled to take place during the Third Year of implementation. It was agreed that (i) progress reports&#13;
for each of the two components will be provided to the Association every six months, starting December&#13;
31, 1996 using indicators acceptable to the Association (Annex J); and (ii) by June 30, 1999 the&#13;
Government will provide the Association with a detailed assessment, by component, of implementation&#13;
achievements, problems and proposed solutions, sufficient to support a joint Mid-Term Review mission;&#13;
(iii) a joint Mid-Term Review would be carried out by the Government and the Association by December&#13;
31, 1999, which would assess, inter alia, the extent to which development objectives have been achieved,&#13;
compliance with the financial audit, procurement and other obligations, the provision of counterpart&#13;
funds, and propose solutions to the constraints impeding the successful implementation of the project&#13;
(para 6. L.j).&#13;
River Basin Management Component&#13;
3.9    The Ministry of Water will be responsible for implementation of the River Basin Management&#13;
Component. Day to day leadership and decision-making for this component would lie with the Assistant&#13;
Commissioner of the Water Resources Department. An important objective of the project is to strengthen&#13;
the ability of line Ministries to carry out their responsibilities. Implementation of this project implies only a&#13;
deepening, not a broadening, of the Assistant Commissioner's responsibilities. The objectives and activities&#13;
of the project component match the core functions of this Water Resources Department. While working&#13;
through the line Ministry, the project would seek to develop the capacity of civil service staff, at the same&#13;
time ensuring effective project implementation by declaring five key positions as contract positions, and&#13;
offering civil service staff the opportunity to step outside the civil service and compete for such positions.&#13;
These contracts would only be in place during the early years of implementation. These five positions&#13;
would include (i) a Technical Coordinator (to assist with day to day administration), (ii) Basin&#13;
Management Advisor resident in and charged with supervising implementation in the Pangani Basin, (iii)&#13;
similar Basin Management Advisor resident in the Rufiji Basin, (iv) national Hydrometric Information&#13;
Specialist to lead and advise in the upgrading of the network, and the establishment of the new national&#13;
information systems, and (v) Financial Controller/Procurement Officer, capable of setting up and&#13;
maintaining project accounts and supervising procurement within the guidelines established by IDA and the&#13;
Government.&#13;
Smallholder Irrigation Improvement&#13;
3.10   The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives would be responsible for the implementation of the&#13;
Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Component. Day to day decision-making and leadership would lie with&#13;
the Assistant Commissioner for Irrigation. As in the River Basin Management Component implementation&#13;
of this component implies only a deepening, not a broadening, of the Assistant Commissioner's&#13;
responsibilities. The objectives and activities of the project component match the core functions of this&#13;
department. The project will improve the effectiveness of the department in the execution of its main&#13;
functions. While working through the line Ministry, the project would seek to develop the capacity of civil&#13;
service staff at the same time ensuring effective project implementation by declaring five key positions as&#13;
contract positions, and offering civil service staff the opportunity to step outside the civil service and&#13;
compete for such positions. These contracts would only be in place during the early years of&#13;
implementation. The five positions identified for such treatment include (i) a Technical Coordinator to&#13;
assist with the administration of this project, (ii) an Irrigation Engineer, (iii) an Information Management&#13;
Specialist, (iv) an Agricultural Economist, (all of whom will lead in the more technical aspects of project&#13;
implementation), and (v) a Financial Controller/Procurement Officer, capable of setting up and maintaining&#13;
project accounts and supervising procurement within the guidelines established by IDA and the&#13;
Government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
3.11    Experience in irrigation development throughout the world has demonstrated that quantitative&#13;
benefits can only be attained, and maintained on a sustainable basis, when the targeted beneficiaries are&#13;
actively involved in the planning, design, operation and maintenance of the irrigation scheme. For that&#13;
reason, the project will put much emphasis on raising the awareness and the level of organization of the&#13;
farmers on the schemes, with the objective that the irrigators themselves will manage and maintain the&#13;
schemes adequately after completion of the physical works. Such training would continue for a limited&#13;
period after completion of works. Key to the successful rehabilitation of an ambitious number (about 30)&#13;
of small to medium-sized traditional irrigation schemes (ranging in size between 50 and 500 ha each) within&#13;
a relatively limited time frame (6 years) will be the establishment of a realistic, workable intervention&#13;
methodology. The approach to put this in place should, on the one hand, allow the Irrigation Department to&#13;
plan and implement activities efficiently and systematically, yet on the other hand, allow sufficient&#13;
flexibility to permit the targeted beneficiaries to organize themselves in order to become full partners in the&#13;
improvement of the scheme. By no means will this be an easy task for the project coordination unit. For&#13;
that reason, ample support will be provided to the Irrigation Department during the initial phase of the&#13;
project to develop and fine-tune the intervention method.&#13;
3.12    With this in mind, an outline of a possible intervention sequence is presented here, subject to&#13;
adjustments and further refinements as the design of the project progresses. Five phases are to be&#13;
distinguished: (i) the selection phase, (ii) the planning and organization phase, (iii) the design phase, (iv) the&#13;
implementation phase and (v) the follow-up phase. Engineering as well as organizational activities have to&#13;
be carried out simultaneously (and often interactively) during all five phases in order to ensure effective&#13;
participation of the beneficiaries. The sequence of steps to be carried by the Irrigation Department as it&#13;
interacts with small scale irrigators over the 6 years of project implementation is summarized below:&#13;

IV.  AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT&#13;
A.    AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMYENT&#13;
The Smallholder Irrigated Rice Based Farming System&#13;
4.1    The traditional irrigated rice based farming system of both basins has two parts:&#13;
*  a homestead, comprising domicile livestock corral and ancillary structures such as grain stores,&#13;
located in a village or hamlet and standing in a grove of banana plants, often inter-planted with&#13;
other trees including mangoes and coconuts. Rainfed crops, especially maize and beans are&#13;
usually grown at the periphery of the village.&#13;
*  rice irrigated in a communally constructed and managed irrigation scheme that usually has&#13;
inadequate drainage, and an irrigation system incapable of distributing water evenly&#13;
throughout the scheme, and where the efficiency of use of irrigation water delivered to the&#13;
system is very low at an estimated 15-20 percent.&#13;
4.2    Farm Size and Labor Availability. Studies of these topics in the two basins indicates a range of&#13;
average farm famnily sizes for different traditional irrigated schemes from 4 to 7 persons; and averaging 2 to 3.5&#13;
adult equivalent labor units per family. Land occupied by the domicile and its associated tree and field crops, the&#13;
shamba, appears to range typically from 0.75-1.5 ha, and is used for cropping small areas of banana, sugar cane&#13;
and onions. The area under irrigated rice on traditional schemes varies from less than 0.2 ha to more than 20 ha&#13;
per farm family. Most holdings (about two-thirds), however, seem to be in the range of 0.2 to 2.0 ha each.&#13;
4.3    Livestock. Most farmers on traditional irrigation schemes keep at least some livestock, even if only a&#13;
few chickens. In both basins the grazing resource in the vicinity of most schemes is substantial, although&#13;
maintaining the condition of anirals in the dry season is difficult. Studies in Great Ruaha2l indicate that about 20&#13;
percent of all farmers on traditional irrigation schemes own cattle, although only about 7 percent of all farmers&#13;
have more than 4 of them. Additionally about 15 percent of farmers own work oxen. A description of pastoral&#13;
issues in the Usangu Plain is provided in Annex F.&#13;
Farming Calendar, Great Ruaha Basin&#13;
4.4   In this Basin the ephemeral nature of most rivers and streams means that the availability of irrigation&#13;
water, in terms of timing and quantities, itself depends on rainfall. Consequently the hydrological and farming&#13;
years both start in November with the first substantive rains. At this time there is competition for labor between&#13;
the irrigated rice and rainfed maize crops. Traditionally the latter has always been given priority and this&#13;
continues to this day despite the greater financial value of the rice crop on most farms. Most cultivation for maize&#13;
is by hand-hoe (over 90 percent of growers). The crop is planted on broad ridges 1-1.5 m apart, 2 to 3 rows of&#13;
maize per ridge, with beans and groundnuts sown in the inter-row spaces. Given the short rainy season any other&#13;
20  Drawn from Working Paper by R Rowe, "Irrigated Smallholder Agriculture in the Ruaha and Pangani&#13;
Basins", August 1995.&#13;
21  Boesen, et al, "Water Resources Management in the Great Ruaha Basin", Ministry of Water, January 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
rain-fed crops, e.g. sweet potatoes which usually follow maize and beans in importance, have to be planted at this&#13;
same time. Dependent on rainfall in a good season these operations are completed in December or early January.&#13;
4.5    Concurrent with the above operations are preparing, sowing and maintaining paddy nurseries, ploughing&#13;
and puddling paddy fields and transplanting out paddy seedlings. Given the about 140 day duration, seeding to&#13;
matunty, of the rice varieties favored by farmers in the Great Ruaha Basin a prompt and sustained start to the&#13;
rainy season is essential if the paddy operations are to be carried out in the timely fashion essential for high yields.&#13;
Unfortunately, adherence to the ideal time-table is possible only in rare years. First, because rainfall in terms of a&#13;
prompt and sustained start is perceived as increasingly erratic. Second, the problem of competition for labor with&#13;
the rainfed crops is rarely adequately resolved. Consequently, in most years paddy fields are not ready for&#13;
transplanting when the nursery seedlings are at their optimum. Transplanting over-age seedlings is a major yield&#13;
reducing factor on most existing schemes. High yielding rice varieties, whether introduction or the result of&#13;
national hybridization programs, are rarely used, although there are several that significantly out-yield the&#13;
traditional varieties that are grown. Given the labor constraint about 50 percent of farmers use oxen for plowing&#13;
their paddy fields, most of which are hired. A few hire tractors are available, usually from larger farmers living&#13;
locally. While farm famnilies provide as much of the labor needed on their farm as they can, this is inadequate in&#13;
most cases and a substantial amount of labor has to be hired in. Such labor is employed on piece rates for specific&#13;
tasks. The rates are very similar throughout the two basins.&#13;
4.6 Harvesting, which starts in June and carries on into July, is normally carried out when 85 percent of the&#13;
grains are mature and moisture content of the grain 20-24 percent. Due to the shorter growth period of the mnajor&#13;
shamba crops, maize and beans, their harvest is usually complete before that of rice commences. The rice harvest&#13;
effectively completes the cropping year on Great Ruaha smallholder irrigated rice schemnes, except for work on&#13;
irrigated shamba crops.&#13;
Farming Calendar, Pangani Basin&#13;
4.7    In the Pangani Basin rainfall is bi-modal, with the main rainy season from March to May-June and the&#13;
short rains from October through December. Rainfed shamba crops are planted with the first rains in March-&#13;
April and the principal crop --maize-- is harvested by the end of August, and beans a few weeks later in&#13;
September. In some areas the short rains will support a second maize crop planted in October and harvested in&#13;
January, but generally the area cropped is small, as little as 10 percent of that in the main rainy season. As in&#13;
Great Ruaha improved varieties and purchased inputs are not used for rainfed crops.&#13;
4.8    Because many streams in the Pangani Basin are perennial, the start of rice growing operations is not&#13;
dependent upon the advent of the main rainy season. Consequently, nurseries for the main season rice crop are&#13;
started in the period early January through early February, with the aim of completing transplanting well before&#13;
the end of March and preferably in February. The object of this is to ensure that the crop is mature before the low&#13;
temperature (that reduces yield, particularly if occurring at the time of panicle fornation) months of July and&#13;
August. One consequence of this is that there is relatively little competition between rice and rainfed crops for&#13;
labor. Under its relatively favorable hydrological regime a second rice crop can be grown on many schemes in&#13;
the basin. The timing of this is determined by the circumstances of individual schemes.&#13;
4.9    In the Pangani Basin a much larger proportion of farmers use tractor hire services for rice cultivation&#13;
than in Great Ruaha. Improved varieties are widely used despite their lack of aroma and other qualities associated&#13;
with the traditional varieties (see Section V). Some farmers have adopted shorter duration varieties to permit&#13;
higher cropping intensities. Transplanting in lines has spread from improved schemes to unimproved schemes in&#13;
their vicinity. Overall the agronomic standards of rice cultivation on smallholder irrigation schemes in the Pangani&#13;
Basin are far in advance of those in Great Ruaha.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
Rice Production&#13;
4.10   Without Project Paddy Yields. Estimating the increment in rice production likely to result from&#13;
project interventions requires establishing existng average yields on unimproved smallholder irrigation schemes.&#13;
On such schemes, yields on plots close to the water source have the potetal to be as high as the best on&#13;
improved schemes. On the other hand the yield potential of plots at the tail end of the unimproved scheme&#13;
(because of lack of water, flooding, salinity etc.) is often zero. Best farmers on unimproved schemes who have a&#13;
good water supply appear to achieve 3+ tons per ha even when using traditional varieties and minimal fertilizer;&#13;
theeafter the yield gradient declines sharply. A conservative estimate of existing average paddy yields would be&#13;
2.0 tons per ha per crop in the Pangani and 1.8 tons per ha per crop in the Ruaha. The higher yield for Pangani&#13;
Basin reflects the better hydrological situation and the growing commercialization of irrigated farming in that&#13;
basin. It is not believed that the above yield levels will increase without project type improvments. Any yield&#13;
benefits brought about by higher yielding varieties and increased fertilizer use will be offset by deteriorating soil&#13;
and water conditions on unimproved schemes.&#13;

4.11   With Project Paddy Yields. These are somewhat easier to assess given the availability of yield data&#13;
from schemes improved under past programs, some of which have employed crop cutting to obtain them. In the&#13;
Pangani Basin, yields obtained at the Kilimanjaro Agricultural Development Project's 2,300 ha Lower Moshi&#13;
scheme are reported to have averaged 6.7 tons of paddy per ha per crop over the 7 years 1986-1993. Agronomic&#13;
techniques employed at this well-managed scheme, including the generalized use of high yieldmg varieties are&#13;
gaining increasing acceptance in the Kilimanjaro Region. Use of these would be promoted under the project. They&#13;
should ensure, in the case of a well-designed and managed scheme in the Pangani Basin an average "with project"&#13;
yield of 5 tons per ha per crop in the case of both the main and any off-season crop. Notably, however this would&#13;
require scheme management to establish an efficient system for financing scheme input requirements.&#13;
4.12   In the case of Great Ruaha the less favorable water situation on the important Usangu Plains and the&#13;
poorer economic status of irrigators will constrain adoption of the technical package. Over the next 4 or 5 years,&#13;
and given the same managernent and design provisos as for Pangani, an average "with project" yield of 4 tons per&#13;
ha per crop can be expected. After that time yields should increase reflecting improvements in agricultural&#13;
research outputs, a more efficient extension service, adoption of new varieties, and the improved economic status&#13;
of the schemes' farmers.&#13;
B.    FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE FARMS&#13;
4.13   Two irrigated farms of 1.0 hectare each are modeled to test the effects of the improvements in the access&#13;
to water, and the changes in production technology: one for the Ruaha Basin, and another for the Pangani basin.&#13;
It is assumed that paddy is grown in 95 percent of the farm, and onions are grown on the remaining 5&#13;
percent. Water use taxes of Tsh 15 per thousand cubic meters are applied to measure the effect on farmer&#13;
income. Incomnes after the improvernents have taken effect are over 2.5 tines the original levels. In the Pangani&#13;
Basin, family incomes increase from US$425 to US$1,100 fromr irrigated farning (only a portion of the normal&#13;
farm family enterprise). hi the Ruaha basin, the family income levels are slightly less, but the incremental effect&#13;
is similar. Charges of up to US$40 per ha (to cover operation and maintenance of the scheme, and contribute to&#13;
capital recovery) could be assessed without materially affecting production incentives, once the new levels of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
productivity have been achieved. Operation and maintenance costs of the schemes are estimated at 2 percent of&#13;
the investment cost of upgrading, per annum, or US$36 per ha.&#13;
C.    WATER CHARGES&#13;
4.14   Water charges are currently assessed in all traditional irrigation schemes in the two basins. All&#13;
schemes have management committees, which coordinate and enforce water distribution schedules and&#13;
canal maintenance activities, and contributions to scheme management. In most schemes, farmers&#13;
contribute with labor for the maintenance of the system, with cash penalties for default. Under the project&#13;
the management of selected schemes would be strengthened, and a system of water charges to be collected&#13;
by water user associations would be put in place to ensure that the operation and maintenance costs of the&#13;
individual schemes would be covered. The water users associations would also collect the "economic water&#13;
use fees" due to the Basin Water Office. The former charges are likely to be in the order of US$30-40 per&#13;
ha, and financial analysis of the farmn models indicates that these are affordable by farm units in the&#13;
irrigation schemes to be improved under the project, as of full development. The implication is that these&#13;
charges should be graduated, to take into account the level of sophistication in scheme management, and&#13;
should reach their full levels some 3 years after completion of the scheme. The "economic water use&#13;
fees 22" are currently equivalent to about US$0.22 per ha. Although they will be raised, under the project,&#13;
to a level adequate to support basin management and regulation costs, they will be kept within levels which&#13;
are easily affordable at the farm level. It was agreed that, for schemes improved under the project,&#13;
water charges payable to water user associations would be put in place within a year following&#13;
completion of the civil works phase, which covered the cost of operation and maintenance of the scheme&#13;
and the "economic water use fee " payable to the Basin Water Office (para 6.1.k).&#13;
D.    MARKETS AND PRICES&#13;
4.15   The incremental annual production of paddy from the schemes to be improved under this project would,&#13;
at fiull development, reach some 17,000 tons. This represents 3 percent of the national market in rice, and is&#13;
unlikely to affect the structure of prices. Similarly, an annual increment of 3,500 tons of vegetables would be&#13;
produced from project assisted schemes. This will easily be absorbed into the domestic market. Most farmers&#13;
sell their paddy to traders, who arrange for its hulling. Parboiling is not practiced in Tanzania. Rice required for&#13;
family consumption is hulled at the nearest village. After further drying, paddy to be held until later in the year is&#13;
stored usually in gunny bags, in the house or another secure location. Storage losses generally are minimal&#13;
provided that the paddy is well dried to 12-13 percent moisture content. The prices used in the assessment of the&#13;
financial position of the farms were taken from local markets in the project area. Markets in cereals were&#13;
liberalized in 1989-90. This, coupled with the improvement in roads and communication infrastructure, means&#13;
that farrmers will get reasonable value for their produce. Cereal prices are not that far below import parity rates.&#13;
The mnarket in agricultural inputs has only recently been liberalized and prices are now beginning to stabilize and&#13;
go down, after an initial spike as suppliers tested what the market would bear.&#13;
22  This is the name given to certain water charges in the 1994 regulation to the Water Utilization (Control and&#13;
Regulation) Act of 1974&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
V.  PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A.    ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF IRRIGATION SCHEMES&#13;
5.1   For the econoniic analysis of the costs and benefits of investment in irrigation, import parity prices were&#13;
calculated for rice, and for urea, the two key traded commodities. The economic price of rice is somewhat higher&#13;
than its financial price, and the economic price of urea is lower than its financial price. Foreign exchange rates are&#13;
market determined, and will continue to be for the near future, and no attempt was made to adjust them. Tariffs&#13;
on trade are low. Labor is scarce at planting, weeding and harvest time in irrigated areas, and no discount was&#13;
applied to the wage rates.&#13;
5.2    The analysis of the schemes' viability is based on a model of a 250 ha scheme, a size which is&#13;
deemed to be representative of the schemes to be assisted. The census of traditional smallholder schemes&#13;
carried out in January - July 1995 indicates that there are few traditional smallholder schemes of over 500&#13;
ha. It is possible that the construction cost per ha could be lower on larger schemes but, in any event, the&#13;
logistical and organizational problems (and their associated costs) would probably increase and compensate&#13;
for the lowered construction cost. As in the individual farm models, it is assumed that paddy will cover 95&#13;
percent of the irrigated area, and vegetables (represented by onions in the model) on the remaining 5&#13;
percent. Double cropping is not included, although this is practiced on 10- 15 percent of the irrigated areas&#13;
in the Pangani basin. The retums within the irrigation schemes from the investment in improved&#13;
infrastructure come from (i) bringing all yields in the scheme up to the 'potential' level, due to the&#13;
improvements in distribution efficiency, ensuring water reaches those at the tail end of the canals, and the&#13;
reduction in water logging and drainage problems; (ii) reducing the risks associated with intensification, by&#13;
providing an assurance that sufficient water would be available at crucial periods during the growing cycle&#13;
as a result of improved infrastructure (which provide such a guarantee to the 'tail-enders') as well as&#13;
improvements in basin management (which would ensure that the seasonal 'right' to water held by the&#13;
scheme guarantees them access to that water during the specified period); and (iii) strengthening of&#13;
communal scheme management, training farmers in water management, directed research on improved&#13;
varieties, and assistance to scheme committees in organizing access to improved seeds, fertilizer and other&#13;
inputs required for the intensification process.&#13;
5.3   Very little information is available on the real costs of improving irrigation schemes in Tanzania.&#13;
The construction costs of an existing 500 Ha scheme in the Usangu Plain were of the order of US$1,500 to&#13;
US$2,000 per ha. An average infrastructure improvement cost of US$1,800 per ha was used in this&#13;
assessment. The project would improve a total of 7,000 ha over six years, reaching an equivalent number&#13;
of farm families in some 25 to 30 schemes in the two target river basins.&#13;
5.4   On the basis of these assumptions, the "on scheme production" returns to the improvements in&#13;
scheme infrastructure were assessed. The Economic Rate of Return would be of the order of 12 percent&#13;
over 20 years. The economic value of the amount of water saved by improvements in irrigation efficiency&#13;
and offtake control, an important positive externality from the improvements in irrigation efficiency, are not&#13;
included in this calculation, which is restricted to the 'within irrigation scheme' perspective. These positive&#13;
benefits are very high, and provide a strong justification for the investment in irrigation infrastructure and&#13;
the regulation of river basin management, as will be noted in the next section.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
B.    THE RETURNS TO BASIN MANAGEMENT"&#13;
The Rufiji Basin&#13;
5.5    The Rufiji Basin covers an area of 177,000 km2, about one-fifth of the entire country. The&#13;
utilization of water can be summarized as follows:&#13;
*  Some 18,000 hectares are irrigated, only, but the potential is quite considerable. Much of that&#13;
potential, however, is based on improved roads and the realization of Stiegler's Gorge&#13;
hydropower project, which is currently not economically feasible, and environmentally&#13;
controversial as it would affect the Selous Gamne Reserve. It is not identified in the least-cost&#13;
expansion path for the power sector.&#13;
* Hydropower in the Ruaha River sub-basin is developed in Kidatu (204 MW rated capacity)&#13;
and Mtera (80 MW), both located below the irrigated areas. Hydropower from these sources&#13;
represent 85 percent of the electricity delivered to the national grid.&#13;
*  Fisheries are poorly documented, and there is virtually no quantitative information available&#13;
for the time being. About 3,000 tons of tilapia were landed in 1991. Fisheries would appear to&#13;
have an interest that is strongly complementary to hydropower, as it is dependent on high&#13;
streamflow and high water tables in dams.&#13;
*  Domestic water use is required for about 2 million people living in the river basin, of which&#13;
about 187,000 are in urban areas, mostly in Iringa town. This use is largely non-consumptive,&#13;
as it is balanced by return flows. Pollution, however, is an issue, which is dealt with in&#13;
24&#13;
separate papers for the project.&#13;
-  Livestock demand for water per se is "minor" in comparison to the water available in the basin&#13;
but localized conflicts for dry season grazing land and fodder could nevertheless be acute and&#13;
warrant specific measures to determine water rights. This is the subject of a separate study. 25&#13;
-  The Utengule swamp could be listed as another water "user" as evaporation losses are&#13;
substantial: in the order of 8-20 percent of the inflow to the Mtera reservoir. The ecosystem&#13;
characteristics of this area warrants a special study, to be funded under the project.&#13;
The Pangani Basin&#13;
5.6    This basin comprises an area of 56,300 km2. Surface water accounts for about 95 percent of water&#13;
use in the basin. The major water use categories and their salient characteristics can be summarized as&#13;
follows:&#13;

July 1995.&#13;
24  Working Paper by R. Dubois, "Initial Environmental Evaluation", May 1995, and Ian Payne, "Environment&#13;
Specialist Report", July 1995.&#13;
25 Working Paper by S. Charnley, "Pastoralism, Irrigation and Environmental Concerns on the Usangu Plains",&#13;
August 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
*  Irrigation is located upstream from the hydropower capacity. In the Kilimanjaro region about&#13;
16,000 hectares are under traditional irrigation, operating at an efficiency of 15-20 percent.&#13;
The Tanga region contains about 10,000 hectares of irrigated land, some 65 percent of which&#13;
are traditional furrows. In Arusha region some 4,000 ha of the basin are irrigated, making the&#13;
total (recorded) irrigated area in the basin at least 30,000 hectares. The potentially irrigable&#13;
area has been estimated to about the same magnitude for rice, and an additional 5,000 hectare&#13;
for other crops.&#13;
* Domestic water supply: the population in the basin amounts to about 2.8 million people, and&#13;
the major urban centers are Moshi, Tanga and Arusha. At least in Moshi there is an&#13;
immediate need for an additional water supply.&#13;
* Hydropower has mostly been developed already and is situated in Pangani Falls (66 MW),&#13;
Hale (17 MW) and Nyumba ya Mungu (8 MW).&#13;
* Fishing is reported to take place in the Nyumba ya Mungu dam (complementary to&#13;
hydropower) and in Lake Jipe. Although little is known about its significance, there is an&#13;
estimate of a maximum sustainable yield for this dam of close to 4,000 tons at an effort of&#13;
close to 500 canoes. This level of catch was exceeded in 1990, which indicates that fisheries&#13;
may be unsustainable.&#13;
* Livestock is mentioned as one type of water use category, but there is little quantitative&#13;
information available on its demand.&#13;
The Value of Water in Competing Uses&#13;
5.7    Water is said to be 'scarce' in both basins, and in fact the inadequate supply of water in both&#13;
reservoirs has caused reductions in planned hydropower production, and "brown outs" in urban centers.&#13;
However, assessments of the demand for water for existing insallations, against expected flows, has only&#13;
26&#13;
begun to be studied, in a preliminary fashion, in the Pangani.  Here it has been noted that, at the Nyumba&#13;
ya Mungu reservoir, the inflow required to cover existing demand for water is some 28.5 m3/sec. The&#13;
observed inflow, looking at data from 1980-93, is about 26.3 m3/sec, indicating a deficit, at current levels&#13;
of utilization, of 2.2 m3/sec. More detailed studies would be developed under the auspices of the project.&#13;
5.8    The effect of the improvement of irrigation infrastructure, and the implementation of the basin&#13;
management component will be to reduce "waste" of water, and allow its redirection into alternate, higher&#13;
value uses. The economic consequences of this reallocation of water were assessed below. The two&#13;
principal economic uses for water in the basin are either for hydropower production or for irrigation.&#13;
5.9    The returns to hydropower production are calculated based on (i) the incremental energy benefit,&#13;
assessed on the basis of willingness to pay for increased quantities of electricity (which takes into&#13;
consideration the cost of alternate sources of energy, and what consumers currently pay -- which have been&#13;
weighted equally in the current assessment); and (ii) reliability benefits, based on an assessment of the&#13;
willingness to pay for increased reliability of supply (which reflects the economic cost of outages). The&#13;
reliability benefits were estimated at 75 US cents per KWh used, which, when applied to the typical year,&#13;
amounts to about 13 percent of the energy benefits. These values adjusted to 1995 values are noted&#13;
below:&#13;

5.10    For comparison purposes, the value of water for irrigation depends on the type of irrigation scheme&#13;
being used. Assessments for traditional and improved traditional schemes, based on mission data and&#13;
calculations, show the following values:&#13;

Improved Traditional                    3.0&#13;
Returns To Improvements in Irrigation Efficiency&#13;
5.11    An important outcome of the investment in improved irrigation infrastructure will be a reduction in&#13;
the irrigation and distribution losses within the schemes. The current irrigation efficiency in traditional&#13;
schemes (a combination of conveyance efficiency in the larger canals, and distribution efficiency of the&#13;
farmer channels) is estimated at 15 percent (i.e. it takes 100 m3 at the intake from the river to make 15 m3&#13;
available on the farmers field for crop production). The investments funded under the project would&#13;
improve irrigation efficiency from 15 to 30 percent. The implication of this is that only 50 percent of the&#13;
water will be withdrawn from the river to support equivalent crop production. This water is available, for&#13;
its next best use, downstream. If an improved river basin management system is in place, where water&#13;
rights are monitored and enforced, then the additional water made available from the improvement in&#13;
irrigation efficiency could be used for the highest value alternate user, which in this case appears to be&#13;
hydropower production.&#13;
5.12    In order to illustrate this effect, the "savings" in water which result from the improvement of some&#13;
7,000 ha of traditional irrigated area under the project (this includes both basins) are valued using their&#13;
capacity to generate electricity in the downstream turbines. An average "in the field" requirement of 8,000&#13;
m3 of water, for one ha of rice production, implies withdrawal of 53,300 m3 from the river, with an&#13;
irrigation efficiency of 15 percent. Following improvements in irrigation infrastructure, and an increase in&#13;
irrigation efficiency to 30 percent, the withdrawal requirement from the river drops to 26,700 m3 per ha.&#13;
This releases some 26,700 m3 for every ha of improved irrigation, to be used for hydropower generation&#13;
downstream. For this exercise, the water is valued at 5 US cents per m3, the valuation for residential&#13;
electricity use (34 percent of all electricity use, and intermediate point between the two alternate values).&#13;
Rate of Return, Net Present Value and Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
5.13    These benefits would not be realized unless the legal-and administrative structure of river basin&#13;
management is improved. For this reason, the costs of the river basin management component are included&#13;
in this assessment, against the above mentioned benefits. These returns are not separable from the&#13;
investment in irrigation infrastructure and management. Thus, the costs and benefits of the irrigation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
component, evaluated independently above, are included in this assessment. The economic return for the&#13;
project as a whole, including the costs of both the on and off-farm aspects of the irrigation component, and&#13;
the whole of the river basin management component, including the recurrent costs associated with the&#13;
maintenance of these services, was estimated at 34 percent. This includes the benefits to improved rice&#13;
and vegetable production on the improved schemes, and the benefits from the use of the additional water for&#13;
hydropower production. The Present Value of the Incremental Benefit Stream is US$48.3 million and of&#13;
the Incremental Cost Stream is US$13.5 million at a discount rate of 12 percent (the estimate for&#13;
Tanzania's opportunity cost of capital). This gives a Benefit-Cost ratio of 3.6 for the project.&#13;
5.14      To assess the sensitivity of the project to changes in the assumptions on key parameters, the effects&#13;
of changing benefit and costs streams in ways which simulate potential problems with project&#13;
implementation on the Internal Rate of Return, and on the Benefit Cost ratio, were calculated. These&#13;
calculations are summarized in Table 9 below, and indicate the robust nature of the returns to the proposed&#13;
investments, due mainly to the value of the incremental benefits from the use of water savings (due to the&#13;
improvements in the efficiency of irrigation schemes) in the generation of additional hydropower.&#13;

5.15      The sensitivity tests indicate that even when benefits decline by 50 percent, and costs are increased&#13;
by 50 percent at the same time, the Economic Rate of Return drops to 15 percent, and the Benefit-Cost&#13;
ratio to 1.2, indicating that the investment would still be worthwhile. Similarly, even if benefits delay 5&#13;
years, with the same initial cost stream, the Economic Rate of Return drops only to 17 percent, the Benefit-&#13;
Cost ratio to 2.9, and the investment continues to be viable. The incremental benefits from irrigation play a&#13;
subsidiary role in project justification. When the increment on rice yields is halved, the project still has a&#13;
very high rate of return of 31 percent (although the returns to the irrigation component, evaluated without&#13;
taking into consideration the value of water saved from efficiency improvements, drop below the cutoff&#13;
level). It will be noted further that, if all the project investment streams, including the investment in civil&#13;
works to improve irrigation scheme efficiency, are undertaken, and there are no incremental benefits at all&#13;
from within the irrigation schemes, these investments are still amply justified (with a rate of return of 30&#13;
percent) due to the value of the water savings for use in generation of hydropower.&#13;
5.16      In a further assessment of the sensitivity of the economic return indices to changes in underlying&#13;
assumptions, the switching values on key parameters for the basin management assessment are given&#13;
below, and indicate that a substantial decline in the incremental benefit stream (dropping them to less than&#13;
30 percent of existing levels) or a substantial increase in costs (raising costs to over 3.5 times the existing&#13;
levels) would be needed for the returns from the proposed project investments to drop to a break-even level.&#13;

5.17    The higher returns to be obtained from hydropower production open the possibility of substantial&#13;
economic gains from the reallocation of water into a higher value use. As the system for administering&#13;
water rights improves, the gradual introduction of trade in these rights will enable a reallocation in water&#13;
use in favor of the high return uses, increasing overall economic welfare. As investment in irrigation&#13;
infrastructure continues, propelled by the higher cost of water and the increased concern with reducing&#13;
waste, returns to water used for irrigation will increase, and a gradual convergence between the returns to&#13;
hydropower production and other uses will ensue.&#13;
C.      FISCAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
5.18    The Ministry of Agriculture (Vote 43) was allocated Tsh 17.2 billion (US$29 million) from both&#13;
budgetary sources, in Fiscal 1995/96. This is 3.3 percent of total Governmental expenditure. The&#13;
allocation of total expenditures to the MOA declined some 20 percent in real terms between FY95 and 96.&#13;
The Recurrent Budget rose some 34 percent in FY96 (due to the infusion of Tsh 3 billion for Agricultural&#13;
Inputs), while the Development Budget declined by some 55 percent in real terms. Two-thirds of MOA's&#13;
overall allocation is the Recurrent Budget amounting to some Tsh 11.6 billion (US$19.3 million) and one&#13;
third is the Development Budget or Tsh 5.6 billion (US$ 9.3 million). Some 27 percent of total expenditure&#13;
by MOA (Tsh 4.6 billion or US$7.7 million) is to be financed from foreign sources, a fairly high share of&#13;
the total. These foreign funds, only included in the Development Budget represent 83 percent of finance for&#13;
this section of the budget.&#13;
5.19    The Irrigation Department was allocated Tsh 1.3 billion (US$2.2 million) in FY96, some 8 percent&#13;
of the MOA budget. Of this, some Tsh 300 million (US$0.5 million) is locally funded, with the remainder&#13;
financed by donors. Most of the funding under the irrigation improvement component of the project will be&#13;
directed to one-time improvements in irrigation infrastructure, and into time-bound improvements in water&#13;
user organization and management skills. Funding for operation and maintenance of the schemes will be&#13;
the responsibility of the water user associations assisted under the project. The requirement for funding&#13;
incremental Government operating costs, following the investment period, is estimated at Tsh 81 million&#13;
(US$0.14 million), which is within the financing capacity of the MOA.&#13;
27   The value of the parameter at which the IRR becomes 12 %, and the Benefit Cost ratio becomes 1.0 (at a&#13;
discount rate of 12 %).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
5.20   The budget of the former Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals (Vote 49) in FY96, from all&#13;
sources, was Tsh 11,762 million (US$19.6 million), representing 2.2 percent of the total budget. Of this,&#13;
some Tsh 2,991 million (US$5.0 million) was from local sources, with the remainder financed by donors.&#13;
The recurrent expenditure in the FY96 budget for water related activities in the former Ministry of Water,&#13;
Energy and Minerals was Tsh 643 million (US$1.1 million). The project would put in place imnproved&#13;
hydrometric infrastructure and water quality and volume monitoring systems which imply an increase in&#13;
recurrent expenditures of some Tsh 224 million (US$0.374 million) per annum. While this can be&#13;
accommodated in the future budget of the MOW, measures were included in project design to ensure that&#13;
the fines and fees for water use (which will be raised substantially during the first year of the project) will&#13;
be collected and used by the river basin offices charged with managing the hydrometric networks, and with&#13;
enforcing water-related legislation. This should help ensure that adequate operating funds will be made&#13;
available for the operation of the basin offices.&#13;
D.    ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION&#13;
5.21   The environmental assessment of each of the activities to be carried out under the project is set out&#13;
below. For the purposes of Environmental Assessment requirements, this project is classified as&#13;
Category B. An environmental evaluation has been completed, and a mitigation plan will be funded under&#13;
the project.&#13;
Irrigation Rehabilitation Component&#13;
5.22   The objectives and implementation mechanisms to be used in the component designed to improve&#13;
irrigation efficiency and agricultural productivity on traditional smallholder schemes have been described&#13;
previously. There are no resettlement issues, as all schemes to be upgraded under the project are currently&#13;
in operation, and would retain the same users. Also, the project would not finance any expansion in&#13;
irrigated area. Positive impacts which are likely to accrue from the irrigation component include:&#13;
5.23   Reduction in Soil Salinization and Waterlogging. Many of the traditional schemes in the two&#13;
river basins are characterized by a lack of adequate drainage. In some of the larger schemes this has been&#13;
demonstrated to be a significant factor in contributing to waterlogging and soil salinization. This is also a&#13;
problem in the smallholder schemes. Nevertheless, increased water management permitted as a&#13;
consequence of project investments, through control gates, drainage, leveling, and more accurate&#13;
assessment of water charges is expected to reduce the problem and increase the area of land wider&#13;
production.&#13;
5.24   Reduced Incidence of Water-borne Diseases. Poor to non-existent drainage is also likely to be&#13;
a factor in contributing to standing water and presence of disease vectors particularly as breeding areas for&#13;
Anopheles sp., the carrier of malaria. A reduction of breeding habitat would likely contribute to a&#13;
reduction, albeit localized, in the incidence of malaria.&#13;
5.25   Increased Downstream Flow. To the extent that increased water efficiency results in reduced&#13;
off-take, this would result in "surplus" water with benefits which could accrue to "downstream" users and&#13;
reduced conflict (including for the restoration and maintenance of water-dependent ecosystems) if allocated&#13;
accordingly.&#13;
5.26   Increased Production. Increases in agricultural production are likely to occur through increased&#13;
cropping intensity, improved water management, better utilization of command area, and yield increases&#13;
from more intensive agricultural practices supported by agricultural research and extension (supported&#13;
under separate projects).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
5.27   Possible adverse impacts and issues which would have to be evaluated during the scheme&#13;
assessment process include:&#13;
5.28   "Upstream-downstream" Water Quality Conflicts. Two potential water quality conflicts&#13;
which will need to be evaluated on a scheme-specific basis are: (i) the use of contaminated "upstream"&#13;
water (e.g. polluted with urban sewage and industrial effluents) which may pose a human health risk&#13;
dependent on the crop under irrigation, and (ii) "downstream" impacts associated with system drainage&#13;
discharge characterized by high salinity and the presence of agro-chemicals.&#13;
5.29   Sedimentation of Headworks and Primary Canals.  In certain areas of the basin, high sediment&#13;
loads pose a risk to head works, off-takes, and primary canals and will signify increased operation and&#13;
maintenance costs.&#13;
5.30   Increased Use of Agro-Chemicals. With increased water control and the likely expansion of&#13;
irrigable area and/or crop intensification resulting either from more intensive cropping and/or a shift to&#13;
higher yielding varieties/cash crops, there is a risk of increased use of agro-chemicals, particularly&#13;
fertilizers and their potential "off-site" impacts on soils and surface and groundwater.&#13;
5.31   In addition to the aforementioned impacts, increased water efficiency would likely result in one or&#13;
more of the following: (i) reduced off-take, (ii) increased area under cultivation, and/or (iii) increased&#13;
drainage. The use made of water savings could cause additional environmental impacts. The&#13;
improvements in river basin management should ensure that water savings are used in the most productive,&#13;
least environmentally damaging way possible. It should be noted that no new schemes would be supported&#13;
under the project thus dislocation of people, impediments to movements, destruction of primary habitat, and&#13;
impacts on cultural resources, are not likely to be issues in this component.&#13;
River Basin Component&#13;
5.32   There do not appear to be any direct adverse environmental impacts associated with the project's&#13;
river basin management component. Rather, many of the activities proposed under the component would&#13;
provide the basis for a more rational allocation of water resources in the two basins. Moreover, the&#13;
component could contribute to a reduction, or elimination in many cases, of a number of significant sources&#13;
of water pollution, and could lead to the establishment and maintenance of an "ecological minimum" in&#13;
water resources planning and management.&#13;
E.    WOMEN IN RURAL AREAS&#13;
5.33         The power of women in rural Tanzania has been eroded with the gradual&#13;
commercialization of agriculture. Prior to the colonial period, work was apportioned by sex and men&#13;
and women had rights and obligations protected by customary law. The increasing market orientation of&#13;
agriculture, which began during the colonial period, has affected land rights and the division of labor. Land&#13;
rights have shifted from collective towards individual ownership, with the men as the owners. Women&#13;
continue to be regarded as legally incompetent. In the division of labor on the farm, men took over control&#13;
of the proceeds from the sale of all cash crops, including annuals, and the use of new technology. The role&#13;
of the clan, and its guarantee of women's rights, declined.&#13;
5.34   The Tanzanian constitution guarantees men and women equality under the law. But there are&#13;
various legal instruments which frustrate this objective. The Marriage Act pernits polygamy, which is&#13;
widely practiced in rural areas, and acknowledges the "bride price". Both of these put rural women,&#13;
especially, at a disadvantage with respect to their husbands. The provisions of land legislation conferred&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
tenure to village authorities, who convey this right to households. The main difficulty regarding land tenure&#13;
has to do with customary law which still dominates land transactions among small farmers. Customary&#13;
inheritance rights follow the male line. Women are only permitted to obtain land through purchase or other&#13;
commercial means. The recently approved National Land Policy strengthens women's rights with regard to&#13;
land ownership.&#13;
5.35   Between 15 and 25 percent of rural households are headed by women. Some surveys make a&#13;
distinction between dejure head of household, (with no male partner present, i.e. widows, divorced women,&#13;
single mothers, etc.) and defacto head of household, which encompasses households where the male&#13;
partner is absent or makes a very marginal contribution to the economic maintenance of household. In&#13;
addition to being the head of a significant number of rural households, farm level survey data (in Haya)&#13;
indicates that women were putting in a significantly longer workday: about 10.4 hours vs 7.8 hours for&#13;
men.28 The difference lay in the non-agricultural work. In a study of transport demnands for rural&#13;
households, a further study showed women spending three times as much time as men transporting water,&#13;
firewood and crops during the year.29 The need to care for the sick as the AIDS epidemic spreads, will add&#13;
to this burden.&#13;
5.36   On the positive side of the ledger, the Education Act of 1978 can be credited with having&#13;
dramatically increased girls' access to primary school. Primary education became compulsory from age 7,&#13;
and it became an offense to prevent girls from attending school. In spite of this, the literacy rate for adult&#13;
rural women (61 percent) continues to lag behind that of the men (76 percent).30 The Employment Act&#13;
guarantees equal access to employment to both sexes, as well as provisions to safeguard a women's role as&#13;
mother. The proposed project will be carried out taking into consideration the need to reach out to rural&#13;
women. Women are currently members of village irrigation committees, and their participation in such&#13;
controlling bodies would be encouraged. The project would continue the activities initiated under a Women&#13;
in Agriculture program, initiated with FAO/UNDP assistance in the Usangu Plain. The progran focuses&#13;
on the needs of women working in irrigation schemes, and supports formation of women's groups, and&#13;
initiation of off-farm income generation activities. Sociologists will continue to be included in the&#13;
multidisciplinary teams fielded by the Irrigation Department to work with irrigating communities, who will&#13;
pay particular attention to the needs of rural women.&#13;
F.    RISKS&#13;
5.37   The risks associated with the project include (i) the possible collapse of transparent and&#13;
participatory water allocation and use mechanisms, and the exacerbation of conflicts across different users,&#13;
with negative consequences on hydropower production and the environment; (ii) the lack of sufficient&#13;
political will to enable impartial enforcement of regulations on water charges, rights, use and pollution; and&#13;
(iii) the lack of financial support for river basin management activities, causing a breakdown in the&#13;
information collection and regulatory systems; and (iv) a breakdown in irrigation scheme management,&#13;
reducing the effectiveness of the investment in irrigation infrastructure. The project will endeavour to&#13;
address these risks with measures designed to provide the legitimacy and effectiveness of the entities&#13;
allocating and regulating water, to prevent these events from materializing. The project will support the&#13;

affected by the water resource management decisions: irrigators, urban dwellers, pastoralists,&#13;
environmentalists and others, in addition to representatives of the hydropower generation facilities.&#13;
Financial sustainability of basin management offices would be enhanced by giving basin offices the abilitN&#13;
to collect and use the water fees and fines due from water use in the basin. The emphasis of the project on&#13;
organizing water users prior to investment in irrigation infrastructure should reduce the likelihood that the&#13;
improved infrastructure would be misused. Sensitivity analysis on the benefit streams shows that, if the&#13;
savings in water use are produced by improved efficiency in irrigation management, it is unlikely that the&#13;
returns to the project will be below the cutoff rate of 12 percent.&#13;

Statement of Water Resource Management Policy&#13;
TANZANIA&#13;
STATEMENT OF WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT POLICY&#13;
Background&#13;
Water is a basic natural resource required to sustain life and to provide for various social needs as well as&#13;
for economic development. All the water in the country is vested in the United Republic of Tanzania. It&#13;
is a common use resource which touches on the lives, social and economic well-being of the people. The&#13;
principal legislation governing water resources management in Tanzania is the Water Utilization (Control&#13;
and Regulation) Act No. 42 of 1974 and its Amendment Act No. 10 of 1981 and Written Laws&#13;
(Miscellaneous) Act No. 17 of 1989 and General (Regulations) Amendment. According to this Act&#13;
Tanzania is divided into nine hydrological areas which have been declared river basins&#13;
The Government recognizes that water is a public good of very high value. Because it is scarce, and&#13;
because of the externalities which result from its use, and misuse, the Government realizes the need for&#13;
intervention in order to improve the management of water resources which is used by different segments of&#13;
the society in various ways. Being scarce and vulnerable it imposes strong interactions and conflicts&#13;
between users and the environment.&#13;
In 1991, the Government launched a water policy for overall development and management of water&#13;
resources. The policy focuses on participatory planning, and cost sharing in the construction, operation&#13;
and maintenance of community based domestic water supply systems. The policy however does not&#13;
address adequately cross sectoral interests in water, watershed management or sustainable river basin&#13;
management. These weaknesses in the water policy coupled with population growth, the institutional&#13;
financial constraints and poor operationalinfrastructure pose problems in water resources management and&#13;
have resulted in considerable water use conflicts, particularly in Pangani and Rufiji basin.&#13;
In 1993, the Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals (MWEM), initiated a review of the Water and&#13;
Sanitation Sector (WSSR) aimed at building-on and supporting a number of ongoing sector initiatives. The&#13;
objectives of the review were to identify constraints, plan interventions to facilitate sector progress,&#13;
improve access to information to assist future planning and seek the commitment of external support&#13;
agencies and non-governmental organizations to support specific initiatives.&#13;
Further to the above initiatives MWEM undertook, in 1994/95, a rapid water resources assessment&#13;
(RWRA), with a view tohaving a quick identification of resource availability, resource use and the priority&#13;
issues to be addressed in each of the major river basins. In this assessment it was identified that improving&#13;
water resources management in the Pangani and Rufiji basin was a priority. In both these basins there are&#13;
serious user conflicts, deterioration of resources due to misuse and lack of comprehensive planning and&#13;
management mechanisms.&#13;
Major issues and recommendations from the RWRA include the need to:&#13;
(i) strengthen water resources assessments both in their quantity and quality as well as the monitoring of&#13;
aquatic ecosystems, (ii) improve water rights administration and pollution control, (iii) reduce water related&#13;
diseases, (iv) improve cross sectoral planing, (v) review the 1991 National Water Policy so as to make it&#13;
more elaborate on river basin management, (vi) introduce a participatory approach of legitimate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex A&#13;
Page 2&#13;
stakeholders in river basin management, and (vii) review the Water Utilization (Control and Regulation)&#13;
Act No. 42 of 1974 with emphasis on; (a) defining the water right concept, (b) enhancement of water fees&#13;
and pollution charges as an incentive for water conservation and pollution control, and as a source of fimds&#13;
for water regulation activities, catchment conservation and water resources monitoring, (c) strengthening&#13;
pollution control program, (d) granting of water rights for specific periods of the year, and (e) involvement&#13;
of stakeholders in Basin Water boards.&#13;
As envisioned in the WSSR and detailed in the RWRA, a comprehensive water resources management&#13;
strategy was deemed necessary to foster sustainable water resources development and management of the&#13;
two priority basins in particular.&#13;
STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS TO ADDRESS WATER MANAGEMENT ISSUES&#13;
The Government recognizes that:&#13;
*   water is a finite and vulnerable resource, essential to sustain life, development and the&#13;
environment;.&#13;
*   management of water resources demands a holistic approach linking social and economic&#13;
development with protection of the environment;&#13;
*   water development and management should be based on a participatory approach, involving&#13;
users , planners and policy-makers at all levels;&#13;
*   water has an economic value in all its competing uses and should be recognized as an&#13;
economic good;&#13;
These are the guiding principles in the management of water resources as envisioned by the International&#13;
Conference on Water and the Environment (Dublic, January 1992) and adopted by the United National&#13;
Conference on the Environment and Development (UNCED), Rio de Janeiro, June 1992).&#13;
In the past water resources development in the country was being managed following sectoral, regional or&#13;
district interests. This made it rather difficult to clearly understand the resources available in a&#13;
hydrological unit. Having realized this deficiency the Government has adopted a river basin as a planning&#13;
unit. Analysis, evaluation and management is to be made at the basin level. In pursuing this strategy the&#13;
Government established Basin Water Offices in the Pangani (1991) and the Rufiji (1993), when the need&#13;
arose, as a first step. In consolidating this important step and for ensuring equitable, efficient and&#13;
sustainable development, in both the short- and the long-term, the Government is committed to: (i) adopt a&#13;
comprehensive approach to river basin management, (ii) promote participatory planning and systematic&#13;
involvement of stakeholders in decision making, (iii), improve monitoring networks of water resources, both&#13;
its quantity and quality, (iv) improve analysis and understanding of hydrological and hydrogeological&#13;
phenomena and their interaction with other natural resources, (v) improve the understanding of water user&#13;
needs and characteristics, (vi) remove constraints which impede real development, such as inadequate&#13;
resources for water management, (vii) encourage basin based public sector involvement. Government&#13;
believes such an approach will permit a more responsive and effective allocation system and sustainable&#13;
use of the scarce resource.&#13;
STATEMENT ON WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT POLICY&#13;
Taking the above considerations in mind the Government believes that the existing policy and legislation&#13;
are inadequate to guarantee sustainable water resources development and management and that clear&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex A&#13;
Page 3&#13;
policies and laws are needed. The Government will, therefore, take measures to review the water policy&#13;
and legislation. This review will be finalized within the next two (2) years.&#13;
Among several considerations to be included in the review of the existing policy and legislation are: (1) the&#13;
allocation of water as a public good and as an economic good with a a value in all its competing uses, (2)&#13;
the use of a water user fee as a means of encouraging efficient use of the resource and for meeting the cost&#13;
of regulatory functions, (3) the need for a definition of stakeholders in water resource managment; (4)&#13;
clear recognition of stakeholder rights and the need for their participation in water management activities,&#13;
especially the women; (5), provisions for stakeholder representation in Basin Water Boards, (6) clear&#13;
indications that there will be periodic reviews on the fee, charges and fines to discourage water pollution&#13;
and other forms of misuse, (7) a clear statement that indicates moving basin management operations&#13;
towards self-financing and, (8) need for strengthening the Basin Water Offices and other institutions&#13;
charged with monitoring water quality and with managing the legal and incentive framework to induce&#13;
efficient water use and maintenance of water quality. Some issues to be addressed are as follows:&#13;
(i)    Rights to ownership of water: Members of the society will be guaranteed ownership of water&#13;
rights, which will provide for sufficient and equitable share of the scarce resource., within the context of&#13;
national and local priorities. The minimum amount of water to sustain life will be the highest priority and&#13;
sufficient water will be made available to members of the society for various other social and economnic&#13;
needs, including the maintenance of biodiversity water quality and the environment in general.&#13;
The Government believes that the best approach to promote sustainable development and to maximize the&#13;
society's returns from the use of the scarce water is to strengthen the water right concept by (a) making&#13;
necessary adjustments to the existing law so that the legal status of long time traditional users, who do not&#13;
presently possess formal rights and who are not mentioned in the Act, is recognized, and (b) providing&#13;
rights to a variety of other riparian users.&#13;
(ii)    Recognition of Water User Groups or Associations (WUA): Water User Associations or User&#13;
Groups play an important role in the management of water resources. In order for them to be effective in&#13;
their role as water managers and to become real representatives of users a legal recognition of WUAs is&#13;
deemed appropriate. Arrangements will be made to facilitate participation of such groups by entrusting&#13;
them the responsibility to manage significant proportions of water resources at their local or sub-catchment&#13;
level. This will take the shape of Water User Groups or Associations becoming responsible for ownership&#13;
of water rights and management of the water resources within a tributary of the main river system or a&#13;
surface water reservoir. This allows for cost effective river basin management.&#13;
(iii)   Assessment of application fee and water use charges: The Minister responsible for Water is&#13;
empowered to review the level of these fees from time to time as deemed appropriate. The legislation will&#13;
be reviewed to strengthen the Minister's role on the issues.&#13;
Short-term measure: An increase in the levels of the existing fees that will begin to support basin&#13;
management activities. Preliminary studies during the project preparation phase will allow first&#13;
approximations of the new fees to be put in place by December 1996.&#13;
Long-term arrangements include undertaking studies, during the first year of the project, in order to refine&#13;
first round cstimates on this important issue, to determine the value of water in the two basins and for&#13;
different times of the ycar. The actual user fee will be levied first on economic activities such as hydro-&#13;
powcr production, and large farms, followed by levies on smallholder farmers. The related fees will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex A&#13;
Page 4&#13;
gradually be built into the management system that touches all users with the ultimate objective of&#13;
promoting conservation and minimizing abuses.&#13;
(iv)   Need for participatory approach: In order for any efforts now being contemplated to bear fruit,&#13;
and learning from past experience, the Government will review existing policies and legislation to ensure:&#13;
(a) transparency, in the allocation and management of the resources, through involvement of the different&#13;
segments of the society and the stakeholders in particular, from the lowest local level to the national level,&#13;
(b) stakeholders' perceptions and preferences are taken into account and incorporated into the decision&#13;
making process, (c) legitimate representatives of stakeholders are members of Basin Water Boards and are&#13;
consulted on major issues that may affect them, (d) there is a regular exchange of information pertaining to&#13;
the state of the water resources (both its quantity and quality).&#13;
ARRANGEMENTS TO BROADEN STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION:&#13;
The Minister responsible for Water has the power to review and broaden the present Pangani and Rufiji&#13;
Basin Board memberships so as to include legitimate representatives of stakeholders (especially&#13;
smallholder farmers, livestock keepers, non-governmental organizations such as those concerned with&#13;
environmental protection, land and forestry and conservation, urban water supplies, etc.) within the&#13;
confines of the present legislation. The difficulty now is who the representatives of the stakeholders to be&#13;
included into basin water boards are. For example, smallholder farmers are too many and most of them at&#13;
different places are not yet organized into any groups.&#13;
As a short-term arrangement, pending organization of the stakeholders, the Minister responsible for&#13;
Water will broaden the Boards' membership to include some stakeholders including private citizens who&#13;
are large scale farmers. within the confines of the present legislation. This task will be concluded within a&#13;
year but no specific methodology will be followed in nominating stakeholders as members of the Boards&#13;
as they are not yet elected representatives. Since women play a central role in the provision, management&#13;
and safeguarding of water, the Government will ensure women stakeholders are represented at all levels of&#13;
water management.&#13;
Long-term arrangements will be made: (a) to undertake a stakeholder survey and participatory&#13;
assessment, catchment by catchment, to determine an acceptable arrangement for their participation, (b) to&#13;
educate the stakeholders and users to organize themselves into groups or associations and assist them to&#13;
elect their own representatives, (c) to prepare a mechanism of how they would be included as members of&#13;
the Boards and, (d) making appropriate reviews and adjustments to the present legislation, to include&#13;
legitimate representatives as members of the Boards..&#13;
In particular the government recognizes the need for, and will ensure participation of, representatives of the&#13;
foliowing: (a) the private sector which includes private large scale and smallholder farmers (including&#13;
cash crop and food crop producers), livestock keepers and pastoralists, industrialists, etc., (b) public&#13;
institutions which include representatives of key public sector activities such as state farms, hydro-power&#13;
producers, and regulators of forestry, wildlife, fisheries, land, water, tourism, industries, and mining. , (c)&#13;
non-Governmental organizations which include environmental groups, land and forest conservationists,&#13;
etc. The Government believes that participation of representatives from the above groups, especially those&#13;
residing in the target basins, will lead to sustainable management of water resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex A&#13;
Page 5&#13;
(v)    Assessment of fines to discourage pollution: Pollution is already a serious problem in the basins&#13;
and is responsible for the deterioration of the quality of water. Government will carry out the following&#13;
measures to improve the situation:&#13;
(a) studies and research to review the current temporary effluent and receiving water standards (Water&#13;
Quality Standards as stipulated in Act No. 10 of 1981) which should form a basis for making appropriate&#13;
and reasonable estimates of pollution fines to discourage pollution, (b) development of a system of&#13;
implementing Environment Impact Assessments (EIA) for all major industries or activities which are likely&#13;
to affect the quantities or the qualities of the water resources and the environment in general, (c)&#13;
investigating the possibility of establishing a system of issuing discharge permits based on the result of&#13;
ETA. These types of assessments are also needed for major abstractions and for those production activities&#13;
which would result in polluting wastes coming into contact with water bodies.&#13;
This is, however, a long process which requires adjustments in the present legislation and the Government&#13;
has already started some work along these lines. The related pollution fines would be temporary pending&#13;
the results of studies and research on the same. In order for this process to be effective, the public and&#13;
stakeholders in particular, will be educated in various ways on the seriousness of pollution to public health&#13;
and the environment and on the sustainability of their own programs.&#13;
(vi)   Institutional framework: The Government recognizes the need to separate regulatory functions&#13;
and service functions. Thus organization arrangements as well as the legal and regulatory framework in&#13;
which the organization operate, will be looked into so as to avoid duplication of responsibilities or waste of&#13;
resources and to ensure effective implementation of agreed functions. Various roles, such as those of water&#13;
user groups/associations, district councils and regional authorities, the role of the Government and private&#13;
sector, will be clearly defined. Further, coordination mechanisms between the various institutions will also&#13;
be established and clearly defined. These measures are intended to remove fragmentation of authority.&#13;
Consultations and broadening participation of stakeholders remain part of the changes to be made in the&#13;
institutional arrangements..&#13;
(vii)   Management of internationally shared water bodies: The Government recognizes the need for&#13;
cooperation with neighboring countries in respect of shared water resources. This concept will also be&#13;
taken into consideration during the review of water related legislation. The Pangani river basin has a small&#13;
part of its area in the Republic of Kenya. Though small, it includes an important water body (Lake Jipe)&#13;
which has to be managed properly and jointly. The Government finds it necessary to establish close links&#13;
with Kenya on the use and management of the resources of this Lake. The Pangani basin water office has&#13;
already started initial contacts on the same. A preliminary study has been made on management needs for&#13;
the watershed, wetlands and waters of Lake Jipe in Tanzania. After the establishment of the remaining&#13;
Basin Water Offices and formation of their respective Boards, it is the Government's intention that similar&#13;
arrangements will be made to enhance cooperation on other shared water bodies.&#13;
ESTABLISHING BASIN WATER OFFICES AND BASIN WATER BOARDS AS&#13;
FINANCIALLY AUTONOMOUS, SELF-FINANCING REGULATORY ENTITIES:&#13;
As earlier mentioned water user fees will necessarily have to be applied throughout the basins. The Basin&#13;
Water Offices will be mandated to collect revenue such as fees and charges and to be used to meet the cost&#13;
ofregulatory functions and financing of water resources assessment services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex A&#13;
Page 6&#13;
Short-term measures have already begun: The Minister for Finance has already authorized the Basin&#13;
Water Officers to collect user fees and operate a bank account for the use of such funds. The process of&#13;
applying user fees is, therefore, not new in the two Basins, since big users such as Tanzania Electric&#13;
Supply Company (TANESCO) and large irrigation farmers have started paying the user fee. For example,&#13;
TANESCO currently pays user fee of Tshs 25 million annually to the two Basin Water Offices. Though&#13;
the amount so far being paid is not yet enough to fully meet the cost of regulatory functions, it is already a&#13;
step forward in that direction. The Basin Water Offices and Basin Water Boards will be required to&#13;
account for the use of these funds, which will also be audited annually by Government auditors as is&#13;
occurring with other public funds.&#13;
Long-term measures to be undertaken include: (i) identifying actual investment and operating costs for&#13;
water resources management, (ii) encouraging smallholder to form groups, especially smallholder farmers,&#13;
which will make it easier to collect the fee from the groups, rather than from individual users, (iii)&#13;
reviewing the fees from time to time, which will require studies to be undertaken of the factors and criteria&#13;
which determine the appropriate levels of the final user charge; (iv) reviewing the legislation to establish&#13;
Basin Water Offices and Basin Water Boards as financially autonomous, self-financing regulatory entities.&#13;
IMPORTANCE OF THE TARGET BASINS AND MECHANISMS TO INCORPORATE&#13;
HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS INTO BASIN MANAGEMENT&#13;
The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania is striving to improve water resources management of&#13;
this important resource in two of its river basins (Pangani and Rufiji which were identified during the&#13;
RAWRA as priority basins for intervention), where existing investments and the environment are threatened&#13;
by increasingly reduced and polluted flows due to previous uncoordinated development planning.&#13;
The estimated present population (1995) of Pangani basin is 2.2 million an that of Great Ruaha (part of the&#13;
Rufiji basin) is 1.3 million. The two basins are also home for about 1.2 million livestock in the Pangani&#13;
and about 1.0 million in the Great Ruaha. Besides, there are at least three important game&#13;
reserves/national parks; the Selous game reserve, the Ruaha National Park, part of the Mikumi National&#13;
park, Udzungawa National Park (in the Great Ruaha basin), the Mkomazi game reserve (in the Pangani&#13;
basin) and a number of other small natural game sanctuaries, both of which are of significant touristic and&#13;
economic importance to Tanzania.&#13;
Minimum Flows The human population, the livestock and wildlife depend on the land, water and other&#13;
natural resources available in the basins. Their long-term survival depends to a large degree on the&#13;
sustainable management of the resources of the basins, and on the maintenance of minimum flows in the&#13;
rivers during the dry season. By improving its capacity for management of water resources, the&#13;
Government will take steps to maintain minimum flows in key rivers, and minimize the negative impact of&#13;
unregulated extraction and use on ecosystems, flora and fauna.&#13;
Rain-fed and irrigated agriculture plays an important role in the production of food and cash crops which&#13;
contribute to the economy of the country. Tanzania's major hydropower plants are located in two basins:&#13;
in the Great Ruaha sub-basin of the Rufiji are the Mtera and Kidatu reservoirs with 80MW and 204MW&#13;
installed hydropower capacities respectively, and in the Pangani basin there are Nyumba ya Mungu&#13;
(80MW), Hale (17MW) and the New Pangani Falls (66MW) hydropower plants.&#13;
The Government is seeking an IDA credit to strengthen river basin management and improve smallholder&#13;
irrigation activities in the two river basins noted above: Pangani and Rufiji. In order to ensure effective&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex A&#13;
Page 7&#13;
implementation of the project the Government will establish a coordination mechanism among various&#13;
sectors by putting in place an Interministerial Steering Committee and a Technical Committee at the&#13;
national level and two Basin Technical Committees, one for each basin. The Interministerial Steering&#13;
Committee will have the role of overseeing project implementation while the Technical Committee will&#13;
oversee the technical aspects of the project implementation.&#13;

Statement of Irrigation Development Policy&#13;
TANZANIA&#13;
LETTER OF IRRIGATION DEVELOPMENT POLICY&#13;
Background&#13;
The Government Policy of economic liberalization and the efforts under structural adjustment policy in&#13;
Tanzania have had a positive impact on the agricultural sector.&#13;
The Government in addition to the devaluation of Tanzania currency, has liberalized the foreign exchange&#13;
market which has improved competitiveness in international markets, thereby reviving the export sector.&#13;
The Government has liberalized the marketing of food and cash crops and the procurement and distribution&#13;
of inputs. Prompt cash payments to farmers for crops is now possible and this has improved farmers'&#13;
incomes and provided incentives to increase production.&#13;
In the past, the institutional structure of the agricultural sector was dominated by parastatal organizations&#13;
and cooperatives, directed by the Government. Now the Government is phasing out its role in direct&#13;
production, marketing, processing, divesting itself of its parastatals and shifting to provision of basic social&#13;
and infrastructure services to the economy.&#13;
The Government is therefore creating an enabling environment for full participation of the private sector&#13;
while progressively reducing its involvement in direct production.&#13;
This initiative emphasizes an agricultural production system where incentives are determined more by the&#13;
market forces and less by direct Government intervention.&#13;
The development of such an institutional structure will promote and sustain an enabling environment for&#13;
growth in agricultural production, trade and investment leading to achievement of national objectives of: (i)&#13;
increasing rural incomes; (ii) enhancing food security; (iii) achieving export growth, and (iv) conserving&#13;
the environment.&#13;
The institutional structure for supporting development of the agricultural sector should be adjusted to&#13;
ensure; (i) the provision of an adequate legal and regulatory framework for enhanced agricultural&#13;
production; (ii) that the Government role is limited to core functions; and (iii) that the domestic incentive&#13;
systems and resource allocation systems are directed to promote and facilitate high quality performance in&#13;
discharging the core functions.&#13;
In the agricultural sector, the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives is going through rationalization and&#13;
streaming processes focusing only on strategic core functions such as research, extension, training, control&#13;
of epidemic diseases, policy formulation and management, monitoring, information and regulation. In&#13;
parallel the government continues with a major reform initiative whereby it would limit its role to the core&#13;
function of governance. The private sector is being encouraged to undertake all commercial activities such&#13;
as input procurement and distribution, crop marketing and processing, etc. Rationalization and&#13;
streamlining is continuing at the regional level aiming at transfer of resources from the regions to the&#13;
districts and making district administration more community based.&#13;

The National Agricultural Policy&#13;
The National Agricultural Policy is being reviewed to incorporate the current macro and sectoral vision.&#13;
The main objectives of the National Agricultural Policy are:&#13;
-    to ensure basic food security for the nation to improve national levels of nutrition by&#13;
increasing the output, quality and availability of food commodities.&#13;
-    to improve standards of living in the rural areas through increased income generation from&#13;
agricultural and livestock production, processing and marketing.&#13;
-    to increase foreign exchange earning for the nation by encouraging the production and&#13;
increased exportation of cash crops, livestock products, other agricultural surpluses, by-&#13;
products and residues.&#13;
-    to produce and supply raw materials, including industrial crops, livestock by-products and&#13;
residues for local industries, while also expanding the role of the sector as a market for&#13;
industrial outputs through the application of improved production, marketing and processing&#13;
technologies.&#13;
-    to develop and introduce new technologies which increase the productivity of labor and land.&#13;
-    to develop human resources within the sector in order to increase the productivity of labor&#13;
and to improve ability, awareness and morale.&#13;
-    to provide support services to the agricultural sector, which cannot be provided efficiently by&#13;
the private sector.&#13;
-    to enhance the access of women to land, credit, education and information.&#13;
Agriculture Development Strategy Focus&#13;
Agriculture plays a dominant role in the national economy. Despite this role, much of its production&#13;
potential remains unexploited. Of the total 43 million ha of land suitable for agricultural production, only&#13;
6.3 million ha are under cultivation. Of cultivated land only 150,000 ha is under irrigation despite an&#13;
irrigation potential estimated at 1,000,000 ha. The rest of cultivated land is left to erratic and unreliable&#13;
rainfall.&#13;
Irrigation infrastructure is one of the key areas where the small farmer needs Government support. The&#13;
development of irrigation systems is a vital component of the agricultural development strategy because&#13;
irrigated food crop production improves food security particularly in the drought seasons and in areas of&#13;
inadequate rainfall. Again properly managed irrigation schemes provide sustainable increases in small&#13;
farmer productivity and income thereby contributing to poverty alleviation. Also, through irrigation high&#13;
value crops (vegetables, flowers, etc) can be produced under controlled conditions required for international&#13;
markets. This has led the Government to adopt the National Irrigation Development Plan (NIDP). The&#13;
Plan comprises a management and decision making framework based on comprehensive ranking of schemes&#13;
within each sectoral management unit. The plan concentrates on the following: (i) removal of remaining&#13;
constraints on the sector through implementation of various programs such as institutional reform, private&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 3&#13;
sector strengthening, cost sharing, cost recovery, research, devolution of operation and maintenance&#13;
responsibilities to water users in the schemes; (ii) detailed master planning studies; and (iii) construction of&#13;
the irrigation schemes.&#13;
Government involvement in the financing of irrigation infrastructure is justified when (i) the&#13;
beneficiaries are poor, (ii) the beneficiaries are unable to mobilize the necessary resources themselves; (iii)&#13;
technical standards and economic viability criteria are met; and (iv) there is a need for social and&#13;
organizational development to ensure effective scheme management.&#13;
NIDP priorities for public sector investment are as follows:&#13;
-     rehabilitation and upgrading of traditional smallholder irrigation schemes&#13;
-     construction of schemes based on water harvesting techniques, and&#13;
-     construction of new smallholder schemes where there is little or no traditional irrigation&#13;
schemes and where conditions aresuitable.&#13;
Community sensitization and participation would be maximized as a precondition to financing the&#13;
construction of irrigation infrastructure.&#13;
As for private sector, NIDP simply sets out to facilitate, regulate and monitor its performance.&#13;
Development Strategy for Irrigation&#13;
For better natural resources management, the Government will ensure that the management of Tanzania's&#13;
irrigation sector is based on the country's river or drainage basin and not on the political boundaries as&#13;
has been the case in the past.&#13;
The Government has reviewed the experience with irrigation projects and decided to greatly reduce its&#13;
involvement at all levels of scheme implementation and management. The Government will:&#13;
-     In the case of new or existing privately owned and operated irrigation, the Government will&#13;
be limited to encouraging private entrepreneurs to finance their own pre-investment&#13;
studies, scheme design, construction and management of irrigation schemes using their&#13;
own resources. The Government will provide the enabling environment and information,&#13;
as well as issuing water rights, and regulating and monitoring natural resource&#13;
exploitation.&#13;
-     Focusing its support on the development of smallholder irrigation schemes in areas of high&#13;
production potential and high demand for irrigation facilities. The Government will&#13;
provide assistance at the planning and design stage for smallholder irrigation schemes.&#13;
Where appropriate, following work to improve community organization and management&#13;
of the irrigation scheme, Government could finance construction of irrigation&#13;
infrastructure. In this regard, Government would restrict its role to the supervision of&#13;
construction. Actual construction work will be contracted out to private entrepreneurs. In&#13;
all cases where it involved in the construction of irrigation facilities the Government will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 4&#13;
give due consideration to land conservation and environmental problems, as well as the&#13;
need of disadvantaged groups to gain access to good services, land resources and credit.&#13;
In the smallholder sector farmer-irrigators will be encouraged to form water users&#13;
associations, either based on traditional organizations or starting from scratch, for&#13;
management of their schemes. In addition, they would be encouraged to form irrigation&#13;
cooperatives as a step towards commercialization and participation in the market economy.&#13;
The selection of irrigation schemes to receive Government support for upgrading will be based&#13;
on:&#13;
-     confirmation that there is no environmental risk;&#13;
-     confirmation that there are adequate water resources for all stakeholders in the basin;&#13;
-     in the case of smallholder schemes, fully sensitized, organized and committed communities&#13;
and a thorough participatory rural appraisal, or similar analysis;&#13;
-     feasibility studies which indicate technical and economic viability;&#13;
-     compatibility with the National Irrigation Development Plan and its supporting ranking&#13;
system.&#13;
The ranking process will reflect changing policies and priorities and lessons learned through continuous&#13;
sector monitoring.&#13;
As regards design of smallholder schemes requiring donor or Government support, labor based&#13;
construction techniques will be favored and should be seen as an opportunity to use community labor,&#13;
especially if suitable for gabion technology&#13;
The operation and maintenance costs of the improved schemes will be met by the users except in case of&#13;
major common infrastructure such as main canals or drains common to several schemes, which are&#13;
beyond the capacity of members to operate. Suitable modalities for these cases have yet to be identified&#13;
and will be based on further studyThe construction costs borne by the Government will have to be partly&#13;
repaid by the users through a cost recovery mechanism. However, training in operation and maintenance&#13;
of schemes by Water User Groups and Irrigation Cooperative Societies will be provided by the&#13;
Government.&#13;
The Government will ensure that support services, such as extension, inputs, credit, market information&#13;
and irrigation schemes planning data are provided. To improve crop marketing the Government will be&#13;
required to make sure that improved support infrastructure is in place. This includes on-farm storage,&#13;
rural access roads and markets. Research geared to improving water management and crop productivity&#13;
in the irrigation sector is an essential component.&#13;
The implementation of the River Basin Management and Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Project is a&#13;
step towards achieving the above mentioned strategies . The objectives of this project are: (i) to&#13;
strengthen the Government Capacity to manage allocation and address water related and environmental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

concems both at the national level, and in the Rufiji and the Pangani river basins; and (ii) improve&#13;
irrigation efficiency of selected smallholder traditional irrigation schemes in these two basins..&#13;

Pastoral Issues in the Usaneu Plain&#13;
The Usangu Plains are the most important pastoral area in the Rufiji Basin. Some 22 percent of&#13;
Usangu's population are livestock herders, whose collective holdings constitute some half a million cattle,&#13;
53,000 goats, 49,000 sheep, and 2,900 donkeys. Six different ethnic groups comprise the pastoral&#13;
population of Usangu: the indigenous Sangu peoples, and the Ilparakuyo Maasai, Sukuma, Gogo,&#13;
Barabaig, and Taturu peoples who immigrated to Usangu from other districts of Tanzania. Pastoral&#13;
immigration into Usangu began in 1953, peaked in the 1970s, and continues on a small scale today. The&#13;
livestock population of the Plains increased ten-fold between 1938 and 1993, in large part due to pastoral&#13;
immigration. The vast majority of Usangu's livestock herders cultivate as well.&#13;
Concurrent with pastoral immigration into Usangu has been large-scale immigration by cultivators&#13;
from Tanzania's southern highlands. The last four decades have seen the spread of irrigated cultivation on&#13;
the Usangu Plains. Immigrant cultivators have come seeking opportunities to engage in the commercial&#13;
production of paddy rice. Irrigated rice production is also carried out on two State farms, and several&#13;
donor-funded irrigation projects aiming to improve and develop smallholder production have been&#13;
implemented in Usangu since the 1980s. Thus demands for land and water resources on the Usangu Plains&#13;
have grown substantially since the 1950s, culminating in competition and conflict between herders and&#13;
farmers over resource access, use, and control. Farming activities are concentrated in the southem portion&#13;
of the Usangu Plains, while livestock herding takes place mainly in the central Plains.&#13;
This paper assesses the relationships and interactions that currently prevail between pastoralists&#13;
and other entities on the Usangu Plains, specifically peasant cultivators, State Farms, fishermen,&#13;
conservationists, the natural environment, and the Utengule Swamp. The relevance of pastoralism on the&#13;
Usangu Plains to the concerns of the River Basin Management and Smallholder Irrigation Improvement&#13;
Project lies in four main areas.&#13;
First, the River Basin Management component aims to equitably allocate water in the Rufiji Basin&#13;
between different user groups. Thus it is important to assess water use by pastoralists, and to determine&#13;
whether or not their water needs are being met. Second, the Usangu Plains are a likely target area for&#13;
irrigation improvement under the Smallholder Irrigation Improvement component of the Project. Conflict&#13;
between herders and farmers may be a constraint to irrigation improvement, calling for an analysis of&#13;
herder-farmer conflict on the Plains, and how it might be mitigated. Third, the Utengule Swamp has been&#13;
identified as an area deserving special study under the Project in order to better understand its role in the&#13;
hydrology of the Great Ruaha sub-Basin. The Utengule Swamp is the single most important dry season&#13;
grazing area on the Usangu Plains; the vast majority of the regional livestock herd concentrates in the&#13;
Swamp between July and December each year. Thus it is important to better understand the impact of&#13;
pastoralism on the Swamp, and conversely, the importance of the Swamp to the livestock economy of the&#13;
Plains. Finally, it is important to assess project-related environmental concerns relating to pastoralism on&#13;
the Usangu Plains. What are the direct and indirect impacts of pastoralism in Usangu on water quality and&#13;
quantity in the Great Ruaha sub-Basin? What are the potential ecological consequences of Project-related&#13;
activities for pastoralism?&#13;
Water Use by Pastoralists&#13;
Usangu's pastoralists rely on naturally-occurring water throughout the year. They do not manage&#13;
water resources, or obstruct or divert water in Usangu's watercourses. Water is abundant and widespread&#13;
throughout the rainy season and livestock obtain an adequate supply. During the dry season, most of&#13;
Usangu's rivers dry up downstream, causing pastoralists to migrate and concentrate in areas where&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex F&#13;
Page 2&#13;
perennial water is available. Many of Usangu's rivers once flowed perennially, but no longer do because&#13;
their waters are used for dry season irrigation at the southern border of the Plains, their point of entry.&#13;
Both people and livestock residing in the central Plains suffer from dry season water scarcity as a result of&#13;
dry season irrigation activities. Fishermen who establish camps near the Great Ruaha River in the dry&#13;
season occasionally block streams by building dams to concentrate fish populations, exacerbating water&#13;
shortages for other users. In some areas, livestock have difficulty reaching watering points because there&#13;
are no stock routes, making it necessary for animals to cross agricultural fields, which generates conflict&#13;
between herders and farmers.&#13;
It would be useful to undertake a survey under the River Basin Management Component of the&#13;
Project to determine which of Usangu's watercourses dry up during the dry season, where, when, and why.&#13;
Dry season irrigation activities should be prohibited if they prevent downstream users from obtaining&#13;
sufficient water for domestic use. At the least, measures should be taken to ensure minimum flow levels in&#13;
rivers that would accomodate the needs of downstream users and more equitably allocate dry season water&#13;
between farmers and herders. Steps should be taken to ensure that irrigation water is returned to the rivers&#13;
from which it originates. Fishermen should be prohibited from obstructing watercourses during the dry&#13;
season. While this may appear disadvantageous to them in the short run, in the long run they will benefit&#13;
from conservation of fish stocks. Livestock routes to watering points should be incorporated into village&#13;
land use plans.&#13;
It is not practical or justifiable to charge pastoralists water use fees for water consumed by&#13;
livestock. It would be useful to appoint someone to the Rufiji Basin Water Board who could represent the&#13;
perspective and needs of pastoralists in water allocation and management decisions.&#13;
Conflicts between Pastoralists and Cultivators&#13;
Conflict between herders and State Farns is minimnal. Herders rarely trespass on State property.&#13;
However, herders living in the Kapunga area have suffered from the alienation of grazing land that took&#13;
place when the State Farm was established. Those smallholder irrigation projects (the Kapunga Project&#13;
and the Madibira Rice Project) that have or plan to develop new areas for irrigation will mnake it&#13;
increasingly difficult for pastoralists to obtain sufficient dry season forage. Agricultural encroachment by&#13;
peasant farmers onto Usangu's rangelands is essentially uncontrolled, and is facilitated by the current land&#13;
tenure system. Grazing land on the Usangu Plains is open access. As pastoralists experience increasing&#13;
resource scarcity due to the spread of agriculture, bush encroachment onto grasslands, and growing&#13;
livestock populations, conflict arnong them, and between them and cultivators, escalates.&#13;
Conflict between herders and farmers arises from two main sources: 1) livestock trespass on farns&#13;
without permission and destroy crops and fields, and 2) farmers cultivate in areas that have been explicitly&#13;
designated as grazing areas by village councils. Forage is scarce in the dry season. Crop stubble&#13;
remaining on harvested fields is a desirable resource. Herders having large livestock herds - especially the&#13;
Sukuma -- graze their animals on rice and maize stubble without pernission from farmers, often destroying&#13;
remaining crops, irrigation canals and bunds, and damaging fields in the process. This phenomenon has led&#13;
to violent conflict between the Sukuma and farmers and remains unresolved. Herders are desperate for dry&#13;
season resources. The more those resources dwindle, the greater the conflict. Conversely, farmers in some&#13;
villages experience land shortages for irrigation during the wet season and establish fields on lands that&#13;
have been specifically set aside for grazing by village councils. Herders then suffer wet season pasture&#13;
shortages, and have taken farmers to court.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex F&#13;

Immigration into the Usangu Plains should be controlled to prevent increasing demographic&#13;
pressure from exacerbating herder-farmer conflicts. Village Councils should be given well-defined powers&#13;
to control settlement within village boundaries. Permission to settle should be based on the ability of&#13;
villages to support additional livestock populations, and the availability of farmland.&#13;
Additional land alienation in the Usangu Plains by the Tanzanian State should be discouraged.&#13;
Smallholder irrigation improvement projects should emphasize improving existing irrigation schemes rather&#13;
than developing new ones.&#13;
Formal village demarcation and titling activities, and land use planning to formally designate&#13;
cultivation and grazing zones with land titles verifying the boundaries of these areas would help to reduce&#13;
herder-farmer conflict, and make individuals more accountable. Pastoralists would benefit from secure&#13;
land tenure rights, which would in turn facilitate pastoral resource management and rangeland&#13;
conservation. These activities could be undertaken under the auspices of the World Bank funded Forest&#13;
Resources Management Project. It makes sense to collaborate in efforts to manage land and water within&#13;
one geographic area. A special study of pastoral land tenure and resource use on the Usangu Plains would&#13;
assist in this effort.&#13;
Utengule Swamp&#13;
The Utengule Swamp is ecologically important for its biodiversity values, its ecological functions,&#13;
and its hydrological role within the Great Ruaha River system. It also has economic importance. The&#13;
Swamp may have a major influence on the amount of water that flows into the Mtera Reservoir&#13;
downstream, and that is available for hydropower generation. It may also help prevent sedimentation at the&#13;
Reservoir. The Swamp is a potential source of foreign exchange generated through tourism and sport&#13;
hunting. Finally, it supports the livestock economy of the Usangu Plains. Despite its ecological and&#13;
economic importance, no scientific study of the Utengule Swamp has ever been undertaken. Thus its&#13;
ecology and hydrology are poorly understood.&#13;
T'he vast majon'ty of Usangu's pastoralists migrate to Utengule Swamp during the dry season and&#13;
graze their animals there between July and December each year. The Swamp is the single most important&#13;
dry season grazing area on the Usangu Plains, and the bulk of the regional livestock population&#13;
concentrates there at this time of year. It is unclear what the ecological impact of pastoralism on the&#13;
Utengule Swamp is.&#13;
In 1963 some 500 sq. km. of the Swamp was designated as a Game Controlled area in order to&#13;
preserve its dwindling wildlife populations. A proposal is currently under consideration to change the&#13;
status of the Game Controlled Area to that of a Game Reserve, with some boundary alteration. Grazing&#13;
and cultivation are permitted inside of Game Controlled Areas, but are prohibited inside of Game Reserves.&#13;
If the Utengule Swamp becomes a Game Reserve, there will be dire consequences for Usangu's pastoralists.&#13;
There is a proposal to conduct a special study of the Utengule Swamp as one component of the&#13;
RBMSIIP Project because of its hydrological importance in the Rufiji Basin. The findings of this paper&#13;
fully support this recommendation. A special study of Utengule Swamp should include a component that&#13;
investigates the ecological impact of pastoralism on the Swamp, including examination of pastoral resource&#13;
use, management, and tenure at the Swamp. This study should explore the possibility of managing&#13;
Utengule Swamp as a Conservation Area, thereby accomodating the needs and goals of both&#13;
conservationists and pastoralists.&#13;

Environmental Concerns&#13;
Environmental concerns surrounding pastoralism in Usangu that are relevant to Project activities&#13;
include the direct and indirect impact of pastoralism on water quantity and quality in the Ruaha sub-Basin,&#13;
and the ecological effects of irrigation on pastoralism.&#13;
The amount of water consumed by Usangu's livestock population has been calculated as 0.25&#13;
percent of the average annual flow into the Mtera Reservoir. Although the impact of livestock on water&#13;
quantity is negligible, the impact of livestock on water quality may be significant. To my knowledge, no&#13;
data exist on whether Usangu's water supply has been contaminated by livestock feces and thereby poses a&#13;
threat to human health. Health risks from contaminated water would be particularly high during the dry&#13;
season. These risks would most probably be localized on the Usangu Plains.&#13;
Similarly, no data exist regarding the causal relationship between pastoralism and land degradation&#13;
on the Usangu Plains, and whether livestock-induced degradation has an indirect effect on water quantity or&#13;
quality in the region. Extensive bush encroachment on the Usangu Plains has been attributed to high&#13;
stocking rates.&#13;
Tlhe spread of irrigation on the Usangu Plains has caused a rise in the incidence of liver flukes, one&#13;
of the leading causes of livestock morbidity and mortality in the region. Liver flukes occur in marshes,&#13;
swamps, and areas of standing water. These habitats have increased as a result of poor drainage from&#13;
irrigation schemes. The RBMSIIP can help to ameliorate this problem by improving drainage systems.&#13;
Any pesticides or herbicides introduced as a part of the Smallholder Irrigation Improvement&#13;
component may contaminate water supplies used by livestock. Pesticides and herbicides become&#13;
concentrated in milk and meat, and pose a threat to both livestock and human health.&#13;
If dams are built for purposes of water storage for irrigation activities, the natural flooding patterns&#13;
of the Plains will be altered. Flooding on the Plains has a direct influence on livestock forage quality and&#13;
quantity. If water storage facilities are built as a part of the Smaliholder Irrigation Improvement&#13;
component, they will have a major affect on resource availability to livestock.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the River Basin
            Management and Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Project
            are to: (1) strengthen the Government's capacity to
            manage water resources and address water related
            environmental concerns both at the national level, and in
            the Rufiji and the Pangani river basins; and (2) improve
            irrigation efficiency of select smallholder traditional
            irrigation schemes in these two basins. The components of
            this project are: (1) river basin management, which includes
            the following activities: (i) strengthen national water
            resources management by reforming the regulatory framework
            to improve stakeholder participation in river basin
            management, strengthen the water rights concepts and
            management, increasing penalties and raising fees for water
            use, and improve information gathering and analytical
            capabilities at the national level; (ii) improve both the
            regulator capabilities and the information and resources
            monitoring capabilities at the basin offices in Rufiji and
            Pangani; and (iii) rehabilitate the hydrometric network in
            the Rufiji and Pangani basins; and (2) improvement of
            smallholder irrigation schemes in which the Government will
            assist in setting up farmer organizations, and provide
            financing for the improvement of infrastructure to be
            maintained and operated by water-user organizations.
