K   enya has embarked on a highly ambitious decentralization that seeks to fundamentally change the&#13;
    relationship between government and citizens under the 2010 Constitution. The Constitution seeks&#13;
to shift government from centralized to decentralized, and from â&#128;&#156;top-downâ&#128;&#157; to â&#128;&#156;bottom-upâ&#128;&#157;. Among many&#13;

power and resources to lower levels of government. Few have done so to entirely new subnational units, or                  Government.&#13;

Global experience with decentralization bears out the          FIGURE 1: ELEMENTS OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION&#13;

and accountability gains from decentralization. Global&#13;
experience indicates that effective decentralization                                  Citizens&#13;
depends on balancing increased discretion of local&#13;
governments with increased accountabilityâ&#128;&#148;both&#13;

1.3 There is a strong basis for enhanced participation in Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s new legal framework â&#128;¦&#13;
The Constitution and devolution legal framework place a strong emphasis on public participation, transparency,&#13;
and accountability as means to improve the efficiency, accountability, equity and inclusiveness of government&#13;
and service delivery. The overarching principles and values in the Constitution and subsequent legal framework&#13;
consistently commit the Government of Kenya to transparency, accountability and civic engagement in devolved&#13;
governance (see Section 2).&#13;
&#13;
1.4 â&#128;¦ as part of a Constitutional emphasis on strengthening governance â&#128;¦&#13;
The Constitution and devolution seek to enhance governance and service delivery. In comparison to its peers,&#13;
Kenya scores well on voice, regulatory quality, revenue mobilization, public administration, and macroeconomic&#13;
and budgetary management as shown in Table 1. Improvement in â&#128;&#152;voiceâ&#128;&#153; reflects a vibrant and open media and civil&#13;
society. Kenya also scores well in its efforts to improve the quality of its policies and institutions. However, Kenya&#13;
scores below the norm for lower-income countries and for sub-Saharan Africa on rule of law and control of corruption.&#13;
Global surveys have shown only small improvements in Kenyan citizen perceptions of governance and corruption in&#13;
recent years.&#13;

On the positive side, the space for citizen-state interaction continues to expand, despite occasional setbacks.&#13;
Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s government and civil society have gained significant experience over the past decade deploying participatory&#13;
tools and approaches, especially connected with local service delivery funds. The Kenyan media is outspoken and&#13;
independent by regional standards. Kenya has a rich network of civic organizationsâ&#128;&#148;both secular and faith-based,&#13;
profit and non-profit; and research, policy and advocacyâ&#128;&#148;including international, national and community-based&#13;
organizations. A strong and open media and a vibrant civil society mean that corruption allegations are widely&#13;
reported and debated. In addition, Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s role as a global innovator in ICT provides opportunities to strengthen&#13;
feedback loops between Government and citizens, via the rapid diffusion of mobile phones (9 out of 10 Kenyans have&#13;
them), together with Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s pioneering work in other ICT areas like the Kenya Open Data Initiative.&#13;
&#13;
Still, governance remains a major impediment to Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s development. Numerous studies document how&#13;
governance weaknesses negatively impact public service delivery and investment, the business environment, and&#13;
job creation. Analytical work documents how Kenyans pay more frequent bribes for business and informal fees for&#13;
basic services like education and health than in many other countries. The percentage of firms identifying corruption&#13;

1	      The Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) describes how a country is improving the quality of policies and institutions that are important for&#13;
        development. It looks at 4 areas: economic management, structural policies, policies for social inclusion and reality and public sector management and&#13;
        institutions. Scores range from 1 to 4 with 4 representing best quality, and 1 the least quality.&#13;
2	      As of 2012, the CPI ranks 176 countries on a scale of 100 (very clean) to (0) highly corrupt. In previous years the CPI ranked the countries on a scale ranging&#13;
        from 10 to 0 (10 for least corrupt and 0 highly corrupt).&#13;

        cycle. Data highlights key obstacles to business activities in the over 100 economies which are ranked according to their performance.&#13;

â&#128;¢	 Build on what already exists: embed social accountability in â&#128;&#156;organicâ&#128;&#157; pressures for pro-accountability change&#13;
   and in the broader social contract. Social accountability appears to be most effective when it builds on already-&#13;
   existing formal and/or informal accountability practices, â&#128;&#156;working with the grainâ&#128;&#157; of the local institutional fabric.&#13;
   For instance in monitoring and evaluation, there is oversight by non-executive actors such as civil society and&#13;
   media through social audits, citizen feedback surveys on government performance and investigative pieces.&#13;
   Formal oversight mechanisms include parliamentary committees and commissions.&#13;
	&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Taking a multi-pronged approach to accountability reform increases the likelihood of success. Effective&#13;
   accountability measures work simultaneously on different issues and at different levels. Experience suggests that&#13;
   effective accountability measures work simultaneously on different issues and at different levels. This implies,&#13;
   for example, the need to: (i) embed social accountability principles in all stages of the policy cycle; (ii) pursue&#13;
   the necessary harder sanction dimension of accountability, such as enforcement and action, as well as the more&#13;
   commonly pursued softer answerability dimension of accountability, such as information and transparency;&#13;
   (iii) recognize that information alone is rarely sufficient to improve accountability outcomes as it must match&#13;
   the capacity and incentives of actors to act to bring about change; and (iv) adopt longer time horizons and an&#13;
   adaptable learning-by-doing approach.&#13;

submit an annual report on citizen participation&#13;
to the county assembly. Non-state actors are also recognized as having an important role in implementation and&#13;
oversight (CGA Section 87), and in ensuring public participation in county planning processes (CGA Section 104) (see&#13;
Figure 8). Still, despite Constitutional provisions on transparency, a draft Freedom of Information bill remains stalled,&#13;
and numerous sources report difficulty in obtaining even basic government documents.&#13;
&#13;
Key provisions include:&#13;
â&#128;¢	 County Assemblies should develop laws and regulations supporting effective citizen participation in development&#13;
   planning and performance management. (CGA 47, 115)&#13;
â&#128;¢	 County Governors are responsible for promoting and facilitating citizen participation in the development of plans&#13;
   and policies, delivering services and submitting an annual report to the county assembly on citizen participation&#13;
   in county affairs. (CGA 30, 92)&#13;
â&#128;¢	 County Governments should create structures, mechanisms, and guidelines for citizen participation.  The structures&#13;
   and guidelines should ensure participation is open to all without discrimination and have safeguards against the&#13;
   domination of consultations by one group. (PFMA 207)&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Counties should form a County Budget and Economic Forum (CBEF) to provide meaningful consultation over the&#13;
   budget process by county inhabitants. (PFMA 137)&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Various budget documents (Budget estimates, fiscal strategy paper, audited accounts, annual reports, quarterly&#13;
   reports) should be published and publicized within laid out times in user-friendly formats.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 County Government and its agencies shall designate an office or officer for purposes of ensuring access to&#13;
   information and shall enact legislation to ensure access to information for which reasonable fees may be imposed.&#13;

      governments can draw on as they design participation mechanismsâ&#128;&#148;especially from citizen participation&#13;
in local service delivery funds. In particular, the former Local Authority Transfer Fund (LATF) and the ongoing&#13;
Constituency Development Fund (CDF) have been a locus of citizen participation for several years.&#13;
&#13;
3.1 Participation in the local development funds (CDF and LATF)&#13;
Several local development funds were introduced from the late 1990s to mid-2005, partly in response to persistent&#13;
regional inequalities and calls for greater local participation in setting development priorities. The most prominent&#13;
of these were the Local Authority Transfer Fund (LATF) of 1998 and the Constituencies Development Fund (CDF)&#13;
introduced in 2004. The LATF was a discretionary block grant comprising 5 percent of the national governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
annual income tax, managed by the former Ministry for Local Government (MoLG). The CDF is a poverty-linked local&#13;
development fund managed by each Member of Parliament.&#13;
&#13;
Both funds had/have detailed guidelines and&#13;
procedures for engaging with communities and&#13;
citizens. The Local Authority Service Delivery Action Plan&#13;
(LASDAP) process engaged citizens in annual ward-level&#13;
consultative processes, to consider and identify priority&#13;
capital projects to be implemented by local authorities.&#13;
The CDF provides for participation in development&#13;
projects primarily through citizen-led committees: the&#13;
Constituency Development Fund Committee (CDFC) and&#13;
Project Management Committee (PMC).&#13;
&#13;
CDF and LATF have been relatively participatory&#13;
compared with other government programs, and&#13;
a majority of citizen engagement efforts in Kenya&#13;
have focused on them. Civil society organizations&#13;
have implemented a range of social accountability             Women discussing priorities at a local community meeting&#13;
mechanisms, including participatory planning and                                in Western Kenya&#13;
project identification, community scorecards, citizen&#13;
report cards, social audits, public expenditure tracking surveys related to the funds. Some initiatives have been&#13;
implemented jointly with local government/fund staff, many have been CSO-led.&#13;
&#13;
3.2 Strengths of citizen participation in these funds include:&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Kenya has developed a rich network of civic organizations with capacity to mobilize, organize and support&#13;
   public participation. Multiple participatory approaches have been piloted, including in policy making, budget&#13;
   transparency, planning, and monitoring.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Participatory processes have contributed to multiple development objectives, including improving the&#13;
   responsiveness of funds to community priorities, documenting misuse of funds, demonstrating structured&#13;
   approaches for participation, involving vulnerable and marginalized groups, and developing citizen-friendly guides&#13;
   and materials.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Effective participation includes significant up-front planning, facilitators, and financing to mobilize community&#13;
   leaders, train citizens, and develop user-friendly information.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Joint social accountability initiatives involving both government and civil society organizations appear to have&#13;
   greater chances of impact and sustainability. Case studies document initiatives where government and CSOs&#13;
   worked together to plan, mobilize and train citizens and civil servants, and coordinate follow-up actions, and where&#13;
   intended beneficiaries reported greater satisfaction with outcomes.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Incentives can increase participation. In LATF, the requirement for local authorities to report on participation, in&#13;
   order to receive future funds, appears to have increased public participation in project identification.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Providing citizens with technical expertise (e.g. engineering) improved implementation. A key feature of more&#13;
   successful participatory projects was the provision of technical expertise.&#13;

        Public participation in devolved service delivery&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
W     orking Paper 4 highlights some of Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s experience strengthening participation in the health sector.&#13;
      Prior to devolution, Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s Health authorities with support from the World Bank introduced a set of social&#13;
accountability measures designed to strengthen the responsiveness and accountability of local health facilities&#13;
receiving grants under the national Health Sector Services Fund (HSSF). This was initiated to address poor quality&#13;
service delivery and governance in the health sector. The Ministry of Health (MOH) designed a set of social&#13;
accountability activities to be piloted by health facilities in different parts of the country. The goal of the pilot was to&#13;
assess the operational feasibility of improving transparency in sharing information about health services, enhancing&#13;
community participation in health service planning and delivery and introducing effective complaint redress&#13;
mechanisms targeting the user communities.&#13;
&#13;
The pilot, which began in November 2011 and concluded in February 2013, was implemented in nine (9) health&#13;
centers, selected to reflect different socio-economic settings in Kenya including arid and semi-arid pastoral, fishing,&#13;
agriculture, semi-urban, and coastal. It was envisioned that these settings would deepen understanding of different&#13;
challenges faced in providing primary health care services and implementing social accountability in different&#13;
settings. The nine districts (and corresponding health centres) are Kirinyaga South (Mutithi), Lamu (Mokowe), Naivasha&#13;
(Maiella), Garissa (Medina), Turkana South (Makutano), Mbooni (Kalawa), Suba (Tom Mboya Memorial), Msambweni&#13;
(Lunga Lunga) and Nairobi West (Riruta).&#13;
&#13;
Promoting social accountability in the delivery of public health services focused on three interrelated mechanisms:&#13;
â&#128;¢	   Increasing transparency and interactive information sharing at the Ministry of health, health facilities and the&#13;
     community using multiple media. The pilot encouraged display of funds received and expenditure details, the&#13;
     outreach program, user fees charged and drugs available on the health facility notice boards. Visits were made&#13;
     to schools, churches, markets and Chiefsâ&#128;&#153; barazas to raise awareness on SAc. In some sites, community vernacular&#13;
     radio stations were also used.&#13;
â&#128;¢	   Increasing community participation in the planning and review of health facility services delivery through a&#13;
     well-defined forum/platform for dialogue between service providers and users. This took place on a regular and&#13;
     sustained basis to inform the preparation of the facility level Annual Operational Plan (AOP). It involved the&#13;
     community members planning for and evaluating health services through Community Score Cards (CSCs). The&#13;
     rating in these CSCs was based on&#13;

       in the first year of devolution&#13;
&#13;
     The constitutional â&#128;&#152;promiseâ&#128;&#153; of transferring power, responsibilities and resources and delivering a more&#13;
     devolved government that is closer and more responsive to the people, in reality, is still facing considerable&#13;
     constraints. These include, the political and administrative complexity and magnitude of the devolution&#13;
     process, uncoordinated and fragmented approach to capacity building, duplication of capacity building&#13;
     efforts and resources between various stakeholders and inadequate time and financial resources.â&#128;&#157;&#13;

W     orking Paper 5 reviews initial county initiatives on public participation, based on field visits, reports,&#13;
      interactions with various counties, as well as analysis from civil society and development partners.&#13;
&#13;
Since March 2013 elections, counties have been seeking to deliver tangible improvements in service delivery at&#13;
the same time that they build new institutions. They have, inter alia, established their executive teams and staff,&#13;
established county public service commissions, prepared County Integrated Development Plans (CIDP), developed&#13;
county strategies on a range of topics, and are mid-way through their second full budget cycle. They are seeking to&#13;
attract investment and manage revenues. Counties now play the primary on-the-ground role in delivering health,&#13;
urban and agriculture services that previously were managed by the national government.&#13;
&#13;
Amidst these challenges, Kenyan policy makers, national and county government authorities, and civil society&#13;
organizations have sought to enhance public engagement in multiple ways. At the national level, the Ministry&#13;
of Devolution and Planning (MODP) has launched the National Capacity Building Framework (NCBF) which aims to&#13;
â&#128;&#156;empower citizens in the county to hold national and county governments accountable through sensitizing them&#13;
on efficient policy instruments supporting devolution.â&#128;&#157; The ministry has developed a civic education curriculum,&#13;
is embarking on the launch of a nationwide civic education program. The ministry is also developing best practice&#13;
guidelines on public participation. The National Treasury with support from the World Bank has developed Public&#13;
Financial Management modules on budget preparation, execution and financial accounting and reporting that&#13;
integrate key principles of participation and accountability. The Commission for the Implementation of the&#13;
Constitution (CIC) has put in place mechanisms to monitor the progress by counties in the implementation of&#13;
Constitutional provisions including those relating to public participation.&#13;
&#13;
At the county level, a key focus has been to operationalize the policy and legal provisions on transparency and&#13;
public participation. There appears to be significant political willâ&#128;&#148;from county governors and their staff, as well as&#13;
central government authoritiesâ&#128;&#148;to inform the public on county development initiatives and to engage them. The&#13;
paper therefore discusses the progress counties have made in relation to legal requirements pertaining to access&#13;
to information; capacity building and civic education and public consultations. It makes reference to some of the&#13;
key areas monitored by the CIC such as the development of laws, dissemination of county plans, budgets and other&#13;
information and facilitation of public consultations, discussing these in more detail. Beyond meeting legislative&#13;
requirements counties have put in place innovative initiatives to improve participatory processes and the paper looks&#13;
at some of these.&#13;
&#13;
5.1 Access to information and communication&#13;
Across the 47 counties there has been varied progress with different approaches and initiatives to facilitate&#13;
public communication and access to information. While some counties have taken steps toward putting in place&#13;
communication frameworks, there is limited implementation of access to information provisions across the 47&#13;
counties. A handful of counties have developed freedom of information legislation, and a strategy for inclusion&#13;
of the marginalized. Further, although majority of counties have put in place an official website, few counties have&#13;
posted their budgets, fiscal strategy papers, expenditure reports online.&#13;
&#13;
There are innovative initiatives by individual counties to engage citizens. Some of these include establishing a&#13;
community liaison office to engage the public (Nakuru County); live talk shows by county finance staff to break down&#13;
the budget on FM stations and community radio (e.g. Embu, Nyeri, Nakuru); Drama, Art, road shows, and sporting&#13;
activities to pass key messages (Kakamega). Many counties have official face book pages, governors and county&#13;
speakerâ&#128;&#153;s face book pages and twitter accounts. The online conversations and feedback are often consolidated and&#13;
addressed at formal meetings.&#13;

          to facilitate public participation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
W       orking Paper 6 proposes practical approaches for Kenyan counties to implement public participation in their&#13;
        systems that encourage meaningful public engagement.&#13;
&#13;
There are two major processes at the county level that require citizen engagement: integrated development planning&#13;
and the budget process.&#13;
&#13;
6.1 Participation in developing the County Integrated Development Plan (CIDP)&#13;
The County Integrated Development Plan (CIDP) provides an overall coordinated framework for development.&#13;
As provided for in the legislative framework, each county is expected to provide a platform for unifying planning,&#13;
budgeting, financing programs, implementation and performance review. Counties could at the start of the financial&#13;
year, publicize a calendar of events highlighting the entry points for citizen participation.&#13;
&#13;
Before starting the planning process, counties should draw up the process plan to facilitate proper management&#13;
of the planning process. The plan should outline the time schedule for the planning process and how the public&#13;
can participate in the development of the CIDP. It is important to link the planning with the budgeting process and&#13;
whilst this is often challenging even in other developing countries, it is crucial in aligning the citizen priorities with&#13;
available resources. The paper outlines the key phases of the CIDP process in which participation should be considered&#13;
and recommend methods for effectively engaging citizens. These include needs identification, situation analysis,&#13;
strategy setting, project design, integration and approval. The paper provides details and recommendations for how&#13;
participation can take place in the various stages of the planning process. It also proposes methods of engaging&#13;
citizens in these phases (Table 3).&#13;

    Approval          â&#128;¢	 Public consultation with communities and stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.2 Citizen Engagement in the Budget Process&#13;
It is important for all stakeholdersâ&#128;&#148;including counties, civil society organizations, citizens, the media and other non-&#13;
state actorsâ&#128;&#148;to understand the budget cycle and calendar of events to ensure timely entry and strategic interventions&#13;
for meaningful citizen engagement.&#13;
&#13;
The budget cycle broadly consists of four phases: budget preparation or formulation; budget approval; budget&#13;
execution; and, audit and evaluation. Stakeholder engagement should be factored in throughout the four phases.&#13;
Clear delineation of roles for the executive or assembly helps define the process of participation and anchor&#13;
responsibility and accountability for delivery of functions to specific offices. The paper outlines the envisaged process&#13;
of public participation in all four stages of the budget cycle.&#13;
&#13;
	     Phase 1: Budget formulation&#13;
The budget formulation process involves a variety of mechanisms to enhance citizensâ&#128;&#153; engagement. Foremost are&#13;
efforts to improve citizensâ&#128;&#153; and civil societyâ&#128;&#153;s understanding of the budget process, and to increase budget literacy&#13;
through training and dissemination of information. Effort must also be made to mobilize communities and provide an&#13;
entry point for them to participate within the budget process. A successful consultative process therefore begins with&#13;
adequate preparation, as this will determine issue-based deliberation and clear rules of engagement. These include&#13;
sharing of the budget circular and calendar; forming a technical team to lead the consultative process (in collaboration&#13;
with the CBEF); improving capacity of county officials and conducting an information campaign to educate citizens&#13;

7      Overall Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
S  o how can Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s new counties engage the public to ensure that local service delivery is efficient, equitable,&#13;
   and responsive to their needs and preferences? Some fundamental interventions will be critical to the overall&#13;
design and implementation of devolution and these depend on actions both at national and county levels.&#13;
&#13;
Enhancing participation will require sustained efforts by government and civil society to establish structured&#13;
processes that are efficient and inclusive. On the government side, this will include setting guidelines and mechanisms&#13;
for sharing information and soliciting feedback around county government processes like planning, budgeting, and&#13;
monitoring. It will also depend on provision of training of civil servants so that they are able to effectively facilitate&#13;
participation and transparency in these processes. Civil society actors can help to define priorities of what they would&#13;
like county governments to operationalize first, and they can also help county governments put in place and initially&#13;
roll out such systems (as is happening in a number of counties). An important priority is to build county systems.&#13;
Effective public participation will therefore require significant planning, resources, and capabilities to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
    Develop clear guidelines for citizen participation at national and county levels, based on wide consultations&#13;
    with counties and civil society. Consistent with the multiple provisions in the Constitution and legal framework,&#13;
    these guidelines can usefully address: what information on county plans, budgets, laws needs to be made&#13;
public and how it can be made user-friendly; how participation in county law making, planning, budgeting will be&#13;
structured; and, what kinds of citizen recourse mechanisms need to be established and who should maintain them.&#13;
County specific public participation frameworks should be developed and adopted in every county, clearly outlining&#13;
the structure and process for citizen engagement to ensure clarity on when and how participation will take place.&#13;
National guidelines will help to ensure that while counties prepare their own frameworks there is observance of&#13;
minimum standards that give all citizens equal opportunity of engaging.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2&#13;
    Invest in building the capacity of county government service providers to involve citizens in local service&#13;
    delivery. It also requires significant capacity building of project beneficiaries and other citizens. Key entry&#13;
    points are:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Train civil servants on new responsibilities by incorporating material in civil servant training programs on PFM&#13;
   (budgeting, accounting, reporting, procurement, auditing, etc.), planning, M&amp;E that helps civil servants apply new&#13;
   Constitutional and legal provisions for transparency, participation, and accountability.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Ensure that participation processes are adequately resourced and staffed in county and national budgets and&#13;
   human resources. Counties need to plan, budget and staff public participation processes as part of the overall&#13;
   budget formulation and consultative processes. It will be important for them to designate staff with responsibility&#13;
   for supporting participatory processes, provide them with adequate time and training, and monitor and reward&#13;
   good performance.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Conduct civic education so that citizens understand the basic roles, functions, responsibilities of county assemblies&#13;
   and executives. A citizen handbook on participation at the county level that explains entry points for citizens in&#13;
   county budget making, planning, budgeting, performance monitoring in simple, user-friendly formats would be of&#13;
   great use as counties roll out civic education programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3&#13;
    Develop county government systems to facilitate participatory processes. Facilitating public participation will&#13;
    depend partly on counties building internal government capacity and systems for planning and managing public&#13;
    finances and procurement, monitoring, aligning civil servant roles. It will also require focused efforts to integrate&#13;
participatory processes into these systems, such as to: create and disseminate user-friendly information (e.g., on&#13;
budgets, plans, legislation) and link with communications; mobilize citizens and conduct participatory planning and&#13;
budgeting processes (e.g. to design and rollout participatory and inclusive County Budget and Economic Forums);&#13;
and, put in place effective recourse mechanisms. In detail, this will involve:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Structuring county planning and budgeting processes so that there are clear opportunities for citizen engagement.&#13;
   CBEFs provide a legally mandated structure to involve citizens in the budget and public expenditure management&#13;
   process. Counties need to be supported to make CBEFs operational and to design and structure effective&#13;
   participation forums around their budgets and plans. The structures developed should provide a clear mechanism&#13;
   for: communicating agenda for consultations and timeline of when and where consultations should take place;&#13;
   dissemination of key documents (budgets, plans, implementation reports) to the public; clarity on what citizens&#13;
   are being asked to comment on, with public notices and invitations clearly providing a summary of the resource&#13;
   envelope, proposed summary expenditures and targeted revenues; simplified feedback tools that make public&#13;
   input easy to incorporate especially where submissions are provided for; systematic procedures for conducting the&#13;
   forums with designated facilitators; and use of different media for communicating to the public.&#13;
                                                                                                                             17&#13;

                                                                                            â&#128;¢	 Systematically measure and compare local government performance and citizen satisfaction on metrics that&#13;
                                                                                               citizens care about. Annually updating and making this information public can increase incentives to improve&#13;
                                                                                               service delivery performance based on systematic assessments of progress.&#13;
                                                                                            â&#128;¢	 Develop and publish an index measuring participation across countiesâ&#128;&#148;possibly as a subset of other county&#13;
                                                                                               performance indicators. This would provide a mechanism for identifying good practices, and identifying where&#13;
                                                                                               additional support is needed. This will require government and/or civil society to develop systems to regularly review&#13;
                                                                                               and compare the quality of citizen participation processes across counties. Building an integrated participation&#13;
                                                                                               index is likely to have greater impact than having multiple, scattered measures, and could draw on multiple sources&#13;
                                                                                               of data, including existing ongoing surveys.&#13;
                                                                                            â&#128;¢	 Link county performance on participation to financing and other incentives (awards, recognition of good practice,&#13;

                                                                                               linked to future fund transfersâ&#128;&#148;increased participation. However, because LAs only reported on participation in&#13;
                                                                                               project identification, there was less incentive for LAs to report on participation in project implementation and&#13;

            Kenya has embarked on a highly ambitious
            decentralization that seeks to fundamentally change the
            relationship between government and citizens under the 2010
            Constitution. The Constitution and new legal framework place
            a strong emphasis on strengthening public participation.
            This paper summarizes findings and analysis from five
            working papers and case studies reviewing opportunities and
            challenges for strengthening public participation in Kenya’s
            newly decentralized system. It provides a consolidated list
            of recommendations emerging from all the working papers.
