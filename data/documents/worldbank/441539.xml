to protect fiscal interests by controlling the&#13;
coal industry's use of budget resources. The&#13;

            Coal industry restructuring in Ukraine :
            the politics of coal mining and budget crises
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Restructuring Ukraine's coal
            industry has been even more difficult and politicized than
            reforming its electricity and gas industries. Coal reform
            has divided Parliament and the government into two camps -
            one supporting populist policies and the other supporting
            fiscal realism - and the balance of power between these
            camps has changed frequently. Despite mounting financial
            losses, coal miners and managers have blocked attempts to
            rationalize production and employment practices. The
            government has, however, managed to close several highly
            uneconomic mines. Speeding up mine closures seems to be the
            only way to arrest the accumulation of payment arrears -
            nearly US$4billion (including wages) by mid-1998 -- and of
            payments due for coal supplies - more than US$1.5billion by mid-1998.
