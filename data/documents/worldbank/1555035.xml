PUBLISHING FOR SCHOOLS&#13;
TEXTBOOKS AND THE LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES&#13;
The paper is intended for World Bank Staff, and' for those in develop-&#13;
ing countries, and in development generally, who are concerned about the&#13;
lack of appropriate educational materials for schools.&#13;
It is not meant to be read through in one sitting, except possibly by&#13;
those in the front lines concerned with the development and production of&#13;
school textbooks.   Instead, the paper is more of a survey, a primer, and&#13;
reference as it describes the process of educational publishing, its role&#13;
in developing human resources and upgrading education.&#13;
Elements of publishing for schools are described in some detail, such&#13;
as types, historical development, and economics of publishing; concepts&#13;
and terms; author/publisher relationships; organizational development and&#13;
institution building. Special emphasis (including case studies) is given&#13;
the problems faced by developing countries and ways by which to assist&#13;
them. Suggestions for a blueprint and for the execution of a project are&#13;
included.&#13;
Major conclusions and suggestions are: (a) textbooks, teacher&#13;
editions, and allied materials are the most consistent factors in upgrad-&#13;
ing academic achievement, especially for poorer schools with less qualified&#13;
teachers; (b) textbooks, etc. are cost effective tools which greatly&#13;
enhance the efficiency of an educational system; (c) the development, pro-&#13;
duction, and distribution of textbook materials should not be carried out&#13;
in isolation and without professional competence; (d) rather institution&#13;
building, teacher t..aining, long-range government commitment, a total look&#13;
at the book industi6 of a developing'country are prerequisites for success;&#13;
(e) the area of educational publishing lends itself well to Bank financing,&#13;
which can provide impetus, technical assistance, and smooth out the ini-&#13;
tially high developmental costs. It fits in well with Bank concerns regard-&#13;
ing equity of access to education, and building the human resources needed&#13;
for economic development.&#13;

Preface&#13;
In the last decade, much attention has been focused on the concept of&#13;
equity of access to the benefits of development. This should be&#13;
particularly important in the field of education where wide differences&#13;
exist among different groups of children in most of the developing&#13;
countries. Another important concern is to find ways to increase the&#13;
efficiency, sometimes described as the cost-effectiveness, of systems&#13;
of education.&#13;
The well prepared schoolbook, tailored to the needs of the child, is a&#13;
powerful tool in pursuing the twin goals of equity and of efficiency.&#13;
While we plead the case of the book,we insist that schoolbook publishing&#13;
is a field best left to the professional. It requires a wide range of&#13;
special expertise and talents, but above all and little understood, it needs&#13;
professional planning and management of a high level of competence. If&#13;
proof were needed of this statement, the lack of effective publishing&#13;
industries and of acceptable textbooks in practically all of the developing&#13;
nations after several decades of "development," speaks for itself.&#13;
I am profoundly grateful to Mats Hultin and the Education Department of&#13;
The World Bank for providing me with the motivation and incentive to write&#13;
this paper on a subject to which I have given considerable thought. This&#13;
is not to suggest that this paper is meant to be the final word, or that&#13;
its proposals, suggestions and conclusions are beyond controversy. Rather,&#13;
I have attempted to put together a framework of references within which&#13;
vigorous discussions could take place.&#13;
Writing this paper would not have been possible without the good council&#13;
and direct help I received from numerous friends and colleagues. I have&#13;
listed some of their names in the acknowledgments, to those others unnamed&#13;
my equally heartfelt thanks. For all of us there is a task here waiting&#13;
to be done.&#13;

Foreword&#13;
The primary purpose of this paper is to inform World Bank Staff of the&#13;
place of educational publishing in the world and, more essentially, of&#13;
its potential role in developing human resources and upgrading education&#13;
in the less developed countries.&#13;
The paper concentrates on the complexities of large scale primary/secondary&#13;
school textbook production, a first priority for most of the new nations.&#13;
Yet, within the limitations of a brief expository, a more comprehensive&#13;
approach toward creating viable publishing industries in each new nation is&#13;
recommended and described. Schoolbooks are only the first step toward&#13;
literacy and intellectual independence; they must be supplemented, reinforced,&#13;
and extended by a wide range of reading materials on all subjects, which only&#13;
a diversified publishing industry can provide.&#13;
Little is said in this paper about the role of other educational media, such&#13;
as educational broadcasting and learning machines. While such media attracted&#13;
a great deal of attention over the last two decades, their early promise has&#13;
not been fulfilled, even in the industrialized nations. As recent studies&#13;
have shown, and daily experience proves, the textbook remains the most viable,&#13;
efficient, and cost-effective means of upgrading and supporting education&#13;
around the world.&#13;
In meeting its primary purpose, acquainting the World Bank Staff with the&#13;
essentials of educational publishing, this. paper may also be of interest to&#13;
others involved in development programs, including certain officials of&#13;
developing countries. It attempts to explain the publishing process, rather&#13;
than content development, and this important distinction should always be kept&#13;
in mind.&#13;
Large scale educational publishing is a specialized industrial process much like&#13;
manufacturing automobiles, establishing a fertilizer plant or a chemical industry.&#13;
However, this aspect of publishing is little understood or appreciated outside&#13;
of the industry. In the matter of establishing other industries, the developing&#13;
countries of necessity look to the specialized skills, the established structures,&#13;
and the research available from the industrialized nations. The same should hold&#13;
true for the techniques of establishing a publishing industry and for producing&#13;
textbooks in a new nation.&#13;
In describing the publishing process, we use internationally accepted methods&#13;
and techniques for producing educational materials. Many of the examples and&#13;
statistics given are from industrialized nations, as such statistics are more&#13;
readily available and more complete than those frcm other nations. While&#13;
conditions in the industrialized nations may at times provide a sharp contrast&#13;
with those in the LDCs, they may also point up surprising similarities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
By its very nature, publishing for schools, the education of its children,&#13;
presents a nation with political, cultural, educational, as well as&#13;
institutional and technical choices. Political choices generally concern&#13;
the degree of government involvement and control over educational publishing&#13;
institutions and over the content of textbooks. This paper describes and&#13;
discusses'several alternatives of government and private se: 'or educational&#13;
publishing institutions. Obviously, each government must determine the route&#13;
it wishes to follow.&#13;
Nevertheless, the publishing processes recommendedin the following pages may&#13;
be adopted regardless of political persuasion and without fear that they will&#13;
.taint the desired content of the books,,or that by adopting these methods a&#13;
new nation will import ideas or attitudes it would not wish to entertain.&#13;
On the contrary, by using proven methods and skills for establishing and&#13;
nurturing a publishing industry of its-own, a new nation will be able to&#13;
create rapidly and effectively content materials which suit its own unique&#13;
needs, and embody its national philosophy, goals and dreams.&#13;
It is. for this reason that this paper is dedicated to the writer's many&#13;
personal friends in the young nations with the hope that it will prove helpful&#13;
in furthering their goals of cultural and literary independence.&#13;

I. An Introduction to Publishing&#13;
A. Publishing, a Little Known and Less Understood Profession&#13;
In spite of the great variety of publishing activities prevalent in&#13;
the world, most books and articles which have appeared on the subject&#13;
describe only "trade" publishing, the publication of fiction and non-fiction&#13;
books, sold through the book trade to the general public. Therefore, the&#13;
layman is likely to think of publishing in terms of an astute editor who&#13;
"discovers" a new genius in the process of writing grea-t literature, nurses&#13;
his talent, and helps him to publish his work. Or, he may simply think of&#13;
the publisher as a printer. Few people know much about the educational&#13;
publisher, a less glamorous, more technical and more recent branchof publishing.&#13;
Yet, educational publishers employ a great many technicians over long periods&#13;
of time, and at considerable expense, to develop the teaching materials for&#13;
innumerable classrooms.&#13;
Besides providing little practical information or insight into the&#13;
educational publishing process which is useful to those planning for less&#13;
developed countries, most books written in the industrialized world assume&#13;
certain conditions and, therefore, spend littletime in explanation of their&#13;
critical importance to the publishing process. They generally assume a&#13;
literate,,book-buying public, even though it may not be taken for granted in&#13;
view of recent inroads by other media. They assume the existence of bookshops,&#13;
mail-order houses and book clubs and, as often as not, reliable postal services,&#13;
possibly with preferential rates for educational materials, in addition to&#13;
other effective means of getting books safely to distributors and customers.&#13;
In the developed nations, with their highly competitive publishing&#13;
industries, school systems as a matter of course depend on a wide selection&#13;
-of teaching materials from which to choose. At primary and secondary school&#13;
levels, governments generally provide loan,'free textbooks with public funds.&#13;
In conseauence, teacher and school are able to select a textbook appropriate&#13;
.or their students in each major subject area, i.e., language arts, social&#13;
studies, mathematics and science. They are able to supplement these materials&#13;
'or the slow learner or the gifted student. Additionally, teachers in the&#13;
developed nations have the time and resources to produce their own teaching&#13;
aids; or mav turn to   audiovisual materials for support and enrichment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
Yet, in spite of the wealth of materials available to students in the&#13;
developed nations, a relatively small portion of these nations' educational&#13;
budgets is earmarked for books. Versatility, effectiveness, and low cost&#13;
make textbooks an educational bargain.&#13;
In the developing countries conditions are much different from those&#13;
described above. However, little attention has been given to the unique&#13;
problems of LDCs and how they might profit from the experiences of other&#13;
nations in providing effective learning materials for their children, and&#13;
to the difficulties of establishing a publishing industry or enterprise in&#13;
a new nation. These are important topics because of the critical contribution&#13;
which educational materials can make toward achieving academic standards and&#13;
developing human resources.&#13;
As far as feasible within the confines of a short paper, we attempt to&#13;
relate the characteristics of educational publishing to the requirements of&#13;
the new nations. We focus on the problems encountered when planning for&#13;
development and, within these limits, provide a primer on the publishing&#13;
industry. Thus, we describe and relate the special skills and techniques&#13;
which are required, outline and explain investments, costs, and the&#13;
organization of a publishing house. In the final section of the paper,&#13;
we strive to relate all of this information directly to the needs of LDCs,&#13;
and to provide concrete suggestions on how to blueprint and execute publishing&#13;
projects.&#13;
B. Characteristics of the Publishing Industry&#13;
1. The Types of Publishing. There are many essentially different&#13;
publishing activities: newspapers, magazines, scholarly and trade journals,&#13;
as well as different categories of book publishing.    Publishing institutions&#13;
could be government monopolies in socialist-communist countries, or a mixture&#13;
of government, commercial and nonprofit private institutions in other parts&#13;
of the world, including many of the LDCs.&#13;
In socialist-communist countries all publishing activities are political&#13;
in the sense that they are regulated bv and serve the state; by contrast,most&#13;
book publishing by commercial publishers is nonpolitical and largely dictated&#13;
by market considerations. This is an important distinction for the new nations&#13;
to ponder. in many instances their laws do not discriminate between newspaper&#13;
publishing  which tends to be political and, therefore, may be subject to&#13;
various controls, and general commercial book publishing which only rarely&#13;
carries the same political impact.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
In book publishing, it is convenient to distinguish among the following&#13;
categories, even though large as well as small publishers may publish across&#13;
the board in several or all of these categories:&#13;
Adult General Trade (hardbound and paperback)&#13;
Juvenile Trade&#13;
Religious&#13;
Professional&#13;
Scholarly&#13;
Subscription Reference (Encyclopedia)&#13;
Mass Market Paperbound&#13;
Book Clubs&#13;
Mail-Order Publications&#13;
School (Primary and Secondary School)&#13;
College&#13;
These publishing categories have several common characteristics, at the&#13;
same time they may differ in the way sales, promotion, and distribution are&#13;
handled,in the investment required, even in the respective roles of author&#13;
and editor.&#13;
In this paper we shall examine publishing for schools in some detail.It is a&#13;
more technically camplex area of textbook publishing which needs large financial&#13;
investments and a diverse professional organization; in addition, the development&#13;
of school textbooks is of crucial importance to the LDCs.&#13;
2.  Historical Development of Publishing.   As with many other industries,&#13;
publishing had the time to develop in the industrial world. From modest&#13;
beginnings more than five hundred years ago, usually centered around a university,&#13;
a religious institution or a press, the publishing industry has grown large,&#13;
presently publishing over 100,000 new titles annually worldwide, with around&#13;
one million titles in print! The explosion of knowledge, the extension of&#13;
compulsory general education to include 10, 12, or even 13 years of schooling&#13;
with a concomitant growth oE tertiary enrolLments, the post-World War II baby&#13;
boom - all have contributed to the massive growth of publishing activities&#13;
in the industrialized countries.&#13;
This growth of the publishing industries has been heavily dependent on&#13;
the expenditure of public furnds for education, for libraries and for research.&#13;
In certain countries, we would estimate that close to 40% of the annual sales&#13;
of books are financed by public funds, which include the free/loan suDolv of&#13;
textbooks to schools.   (This coint will be further discussed in Section-D of&#13;
this paper.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4.&#13;
Even though publishing has grown rapidly in the industrialized nations&#13;
and isno longer the'sole preserve of the gentleman publisher or the family-&#13;
owned house, certain basic aspects have changed little or not at all. As&#13;
an example, publishing remains small if compared to other industries in terms&#13;
of sales , capital investment, or employment. Thus,$4.6 billion of sales of&#13;
USA publishers in 1977 may be roughly equivalent to the sales of the 42nd&#13;
largest U.S. corporation or, even more startling, in a good year the equivalent&#13;
of the annual profits of General Motors. The previously close association of&#13;
publisher and printer in one house has by now almost completely disappeared,&#13;
and most publishers own little in the way of machinery,- equipment, or even&#13;
buildings. Instead, they tend to have considerable investments in book&#13;
inventories, and especially in the creativity of people: authors, editors,&#13;
designers; production, marketing, promotion and distribution specialists.&#13;
In publishing it is still possible to start a small enterprise with a novel&#13;
idea, a gifted author and a little money, but it is becoming increasingly&#13;
difficult to compete successfully in major areas of school publishing, for&#13;
example. To do so requires financial investments in developmental work and&#13;
in inventory,'all of which is quite beyond the reach of the small entrepreneur.&#13;
A typical publishing house grows slowly.   It takes years to build a stable'&#13;
of authors and to develop a backlist of titles of sufficient strength and&#13;
longevity to provide a solid basis for further growth. This is especially true&#13;
of educational publishing. A typical college text may take three years to&#13;
develop and write after the author's proposal has been accepted by a publisher,&#13;
and yet another year to produce. Depending how quickly methodologies and&#13;
research cause the'subject matter to change, the text will be revised within&#13;
3-to-5 years. Secondary school texts demand a similar schedule, except that their&#13;
revision cycle may be closer to five years. A basal primary series, on the&#13;
other hand, will require 4-to-6 years for development and production of the&#13;
first edition.&#13;
In the United Kingdom, books are a larger market than cheese, about the same&#13;
as eggs, but ,less than. half the market for milk, remarks one commentator.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5-&#13;
Textbook publishing is a long process; a major reason is the authorship,&#13;
which is not comprised of professional writers but rather of educators, whose&#13;
primary functions are teaching and research. It is axiomatic that a potential&#13;
author has to be teaching the subject material if he is to write an effective&#13;
textbook. He must be able to test his ideas on his students and to receive&#13;
input or, at least, reviews from his colleagues. Consequently, textbook&#13;
writing grows out of successful and inventive teaching; each author learns&#13;
and grows with the text he is developing. Quite often a potential author fails&#13;
in his efforts. College textbook publishers find that one out of three or four&#13;
authors they sign does not produce a publishable manuscript. Indeed, some never&#13;
produce a manuscript. Obviously, in such cases, much effort and time is wasted&#13;
by both author and publisher. As shall be seen subsequently when we discuss&#13;
school publishing, the considerable investment of time and money required to&#13;
prodUce a basal primary school series demands a different author-publisher&#13;
relationship, with more reliance by the publisher on selecting and controlling&#13;
the author team and more in-house production of materials. In such a relation-&#13;
ship, some authors/teachers may eventually become professional textbook writers.&#13;
3. The Economics of Publishing. The most readily accessible and complete&#13;
statistics on a publishing industry are compiled annually by the Association&#13;
of American Publishers.      They may serve as an example of growth patterns not&#13;
confined to U.S. publishing by any means. Sales of the USA Book Publishing&#13;
Industry in 1977   amounted to a total of $4.605 billion.   This compared to&#13;
total sales of $2.917 billion in 1971, indicating a growth over seven years&#13;
of 57.8% in terms of current dollars. School. sales in 1977 atalmost $704 million&#13;
accounted for a large part of the business, followed by Trade sales of $631.8&#13;
million, Professional sales of $627 million, and College sales of $592.4 million.&#13;
If one includes subscription reference sales with other educati-onal sales, fully&#13;
$2,500 million or 54% of all sales by the USA publishing industry fall into the&#13;
educational category.&#13;
The industry remains strongly book-oriented, with only $153 million out&#13;
of the total of $4.605 billion being sales of audiovisual material and of&#13;
other media.&#13;
British publishers had total sales of `475 million     in 1977, of which&#13;
almost 40%, or £187 million, resulted from book exports. By comparison,&#13;
exports of American books, while about the same in monetary terms, account&#13;
for only 8% of total business.&#13;

In general, textbook publishing is often more profitable than trade&#13;
1&#13;
publishing. In 1977 , average net income before taxes from operations&#13;
of USA College textbook publishers was about 18% (income tax in the USA&#13;
being 48%), of ELHI publishers 15.5%, compared to 12.8% for Adult Trade&#13;
hardback publishers, and 8.1% for Adult Trade paperback publishers.&#13;
Professional books ranked with Trade publishing in profitability at 12.8%.&#13;
Textbook publishing, in spite of the sizeable investments required,&#13;
tends to be more profitable than Trade pubiishing because it is often better&#13;
managed  and the market for its books is more predictable and assured.&#13;
College publishing is more profitable than school publishing for two reasons&#13;
1) the higher unit price of college texts, and 2) the risk of failure is&#13;
spread over many more titles.&#13;
In a subsequent section we shall analyze the costs of publishing in&#13;
some detail; here we shall restrict ourselves to the following remarks.&#13;
Financial problems in founding and maintaining a profitable publishing&#13;
enterprise may be summed up as follows:&#13;
a. Slow turnover of a publisher's working capital and the cyclical&#13;
nature of book buying make it necessary for most publishers to&#13;
borrow money regularly from banks to finance, for example, the&#13;
build-up of inventories in preparation for the selling season.&#13;
b.  Heavy investments in pre-publication development, mainly editorial&#13;
and olant expenses, may need years to recover.&#13;
c. Inventory turn-over for the average school publisher in the USA in&#13;
1977 was around once (0.9) annually, and between 1.3 and 1.4 for&#13;
Trade publishers.&#13;
d. Receivables in publishing may be outstanding from 60-to-180 days&#13;
on an average, especially if a large percentage of sales are for&#13;
export.&#13;
Nor is this the end of a publisher's woes. A rule of thumb which azplies&#13;
to college publishing indicates that 80% of a publisher's sales result&#13;
from only 20% of his list of publications; 80% of his list contributes&#13;
only 20% of sales. Knowingly or unknowingly, a publisher produces many&#13;

titles which at best break even, or at worst lose a great deal of money.&#13;
His backlist deteriorates fairly rapidly, and yet as an obligation to his&#13;
authors and public he must keep unprofitable titles in print for many&#13;
years. Such a state of affairs has given rise to the following apocry-&#13;
phal story:&#13;
At the time when huge electronics companies bought publishers in&#13;
an effort to secure appropriate software for their inventions,&#13;
the treasurer of such an electronic giant was sent to inspect a&#13;
newly acquired medium-sized publisher. Looking at the profusion&#13;
of largely unprofitable materials which made up an unimpressive&#13;
$20 million in sales, faced by slow turnover, investment, inven-&#13;
tory and credit problems, the treasurer of the $2 billion con-&#13;
glomerate quickly recognized the principal problem and reported&#13;
back to his Board: "I straightened out the management problems&#13;
of our new publishing sub," he supposedly said, "and instructed&#13;
them from now on-to publish only best sellers."&#13;
Aside from the need to publish bestsellers, which will support the&#13;
rest of his list, a publisher traditionally has had serious problems in&#13;
obtaining bank financing.   A large inventory of printed books, some of&#13;
which may never sell, has always been regarded as poor collateral by banks.&#13;
Summary.    Publishing is not a large business compared to other in-&#13;
dustries. The growth of a publishing industry depends first and foremost&#13;
on the availability of public funds for education, specifically for text-&#13;
books and the development of libraries, and also on an educated, book-&#13;
conscious public.&#13;
Financial resources are needed to sustain the initially slow growth&#13;
of a publisher and to finance his investment, especially for pre-publi-&#13;
cation expenses and inventory build-up in preparation for cyclical seilina&#13;
seasons.&#13;
C. The Role of Publishing&#13;
To publish means to make public or to make available. Obviouslv, in&#13;
many areas of publishing publishers have gone beyond the original concept&#13;
of making public a manuscript which has been dffered to them. Instead,&#13;
they actively encourage authors to write, by commissioning materials, or,&#13;
as in much of school publishing, by becoming a partner with the author team&#13;
in the development of materials.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In contrast to their status as the product of a rather small industry,&#13;
books are prestigious and enjoy high visibility. Thus, no one is against&#13;
books, even though most people may wish to see some titles or categories&#13;
of books cehsured or altogether suppressed. If all these diverse critics&#13;
hadtheir way, little of anything would get published. In recent times,&#13;
considerablecriticism, some of it deserved, has been leveled at the industry&#13;
by authors as well as the general public who perceive publishers as "gate&#13;
keepers" who decide what should be read. Yet, publishing permits a "fine&#13;
tuning" by the public not even remotely reached by other media, while a&#13;
stupendous range of materials on every conceivable topilc is available in the&#13;
1&#13;
western world . Most governments, fortunately not with the same zeal, enforce&#13;
some forms of censorship on the publishing industry on grounds such, as national&#13;
security, offense to the state, or simply by invoking the "current standards&#13;
of acceptance" in the community.&#13;
If trade or general publishing has censorship problems, educational materials,&#13;
especially those that children are exposed to in primary and secondary schools,&#13;
are even more closely scrutinized. Their content must not be offensive to anyone,&#13;
often an impossible task in social studies programs, in most reading programs,&#13;
and even science texts where arguments for or against genesis are still very&#13;
much alive. In addition, textbooks must be "effective," performance-tested,&#13;
teaching tools, and reflect the current vogue or trends in methodology.&#13;
With so many checks and balances working on the publisher, it is fair to&#13;
assume that the output of most publishing industries tends to reflect the&#13;
current state of the community it serves. Sensitive or adventurous publishers&#13;
may anticipate or even lead changes in the attitudes and standards of the&#13;
community, or of the educational establishment. In support of an eloquent&#13;
author or a deserving argument, they sometimes publish pace setters, such as:&#13;
Silent Spring, by Rachel Carson,&#13;
Unsafe at any Speed, by Ralph Nader,&#13;
The Pentagon Papers, or&#13;
The American Challenge, by Servan Schreiber.&#13;
Nonetheless, for a majority of commercial publishers, both trade and educational,&#13;
the dictates of the marketplace and the educational establishment remain the&#13;
ultimate criterion.&#13;

D. The Book Gap&#13;
Mr. Curtis G. Benjamin, for twenty years President and Chairman,&#13;
successively, of the McGraw-Hill Book Company, is undoubtedly one of the&#13;
most astute observers of and prolific commentators on the development of&#13;
the world book industry. In a paper presented in 1969, from which we have&#13;
borrowed more than one idea ("The Economic Foundations of Book Publishing"),&#13;
Curtis Benjamin had this to say about the "Book Gap":&#13;
Not long ago a friend of mine, a wise and knowledgeable&#13;
man, remarked wistfully, "Of one thing I'm firmly&#13;
convinced: You can't fill book gaps with books."&#13;
In a similar vein, we like to suggest that books are not a commodity,&#13;
such as rice or flour. You cannot still book hunger with books. In this,&#13;
we are reminded of Robert Kennedy, who proclaimed that Africa needed a million&#13;
books when he returned from that continent in 1963, and how he had a nation&#13;
scurry to their attics looking for "books."&#13;
In his paper, Mr. Benjamin goes on to suggest "that the supply of books,&#13;
no matter how plentiful, will not filla country's need unless adequate marketing&#13;
mechanisms and sufficient distribution channels have been provided, and uaQe.z&#13;
tewading use o6 the book,6 uLs a&amp;uwed in the end."'&#13;
Mr. Benjamin is not alone in his opinion, which is shared by most know-&#13;
ledgeable observers of book programs. Too many government warehouses, too&#13;
many shelves and cupboards in libraries and schools of the LDCs are already&#13;
filled to capacity with little used books produced by some program or donated&#13;
by some agency.  Such book accumulations may be worse than useless because&#13;
they occupy valuable space and provide the illusion of a resource while not&#13;
meeting by a wide margin the needs of those for whom they are intended.&#13;
In discussing the Book Gap, several things must be kept in mind:&#13;
* The Book Gap exists primarily between effective demand in the market-&#13;
place for books and the real needs ofa new nation for sources of&#13;
education, cultural development, self-improvement, information and&#13;
entertainment.&#13;
* Only appropriate government action can provide those Drimary markets&#13;
for textbooks and librarv development which are essential to the&#13;
establishment and support of a publishing industry.&#13;
* Other markets important to the support of a publishing industry depend&#13;
on the use of books in schools, t-heir availability in libraries and,&#13;
Our italics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
in general,the creation of the reading habit. These markets include&#13;
practical books and manuals for job training or self improvement,&#13;
reference books, literary works, and children's books.&#13;
Only in response to such stimuli, and with the availability of suf-&#13;
ficient financial resources, will it be possible to develop indi-&#13;
genous publishing industries on the one hand, and to permit the selec-&#13;
tion and importation of suitable books from abroad on the other.&#13;
Most countries have the capacity to create an indigenous publishing&#13;
industry in response to effective demand, especially if they are open&#13;
to accepting technical assistance, models, and possibly partnership&#13;
from developed publishing industries.&#13;
Summary.    Book Gaps exist primarily between effective demand in the mar-&#13;
ketplace for books and the real needs of a nation. Major and sustained govern-&#13;
ment action is needed to create the effective demand for books which is a&#13;
prerequisite for a publishing industry. Book programs which can be of tem-&#13;
porary assistance must be carefully and professionally tailored to fill a&#13;
specific demand for certain types of books, and they must assure, along with&#13;
careful development of suitable materials, proper distribution, acceptance&#13;
and usage of the books.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. Textbook Publishing: Background and Definitions&#13;
A. Teaching and Textbooks&#13;
Most good teaching has structure and variety, aims at presenting con-&#13;
cepts, content, problems and exercises in ways that motivate the student to&#13;
learn and that reinforce each other, spiral and repeat. Most lessons are or-&#13;
ganized and divided into units that fit classroom situations as well as teaching&#13;
periods. A good teacher individualizes his/her methods to suit the range&#13;
of learning abilities represented in the classroom. -&#13;
A good textbook should do much the same. Just as a lesson taught by a&#13;
teacher is more than chalk and talk, a textbook page, a unit, or chapter,&#13;
should be more than a recital of fact or a setting out of exercises. It must&#13;
be visual: offer structure, variety, and present its materials in different&#13;
ways; it should motivate, spiral, and reinforce. A textbook must be organized&#13;
and divided into units that fit the classroom situation, and the time available&#13;
for teaching the subject. It should provide for individualization, for the&#13;
different abilities represented in the classroom.&#13;
Good textbook materials are as rare as outstanding teachers. They&#13;
require creative and seasoned authorship, developed and supported by a pro-&#13;
fessional organization specializing in educational publishing. If the pro-&#13;
cess is little understood outside the profession, nevertheless, technicues&#13;
exist for mastering it which may be applied to different subjects, to books&#13;
as well as supplementary materials, to other languages, and cultures.&#13;
Textbook projects are initiated almost daily in every nation of the&#13;
world. They are undertaken by widely diverse organizations and individuals&#13;
for a variety of reasons.&#13;
Recent studies of conditions in the LDCs, together with the daily class-&#13;
room experience of thousands of teachers and students everywhere, indicate&#13;
that the textbook, defined as including all printed materials used in edu-&#13;
cation, is the single most potent and cost-effective instrument for raising&#13;
academic standards in the classroom.&#13;
Consequently, textbook projects, as an influential aid to development,&#13;
have received increased attention by governments of less developed countries,&#13;
and by the national and international organizations devoted to providing them&#13;
with assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12. -&#13;
In the following pages, we describe models of successful textbook&#13;
development, including editorial techniques, basic vocabulary and definitions,&#13;
which, for the sake of convenience, are mostly taken from current practices&#13;
in the English-speaking world, although other European or Latin American&#13;
practices would not be essentially different.&#13;
Early educational development on the North American Continent had&#13;
elements in -common with the less developed nations.  Universal compulsory&#13;
education was introduced in North America at a time when there was a&#13;
general lack of trained teachers, and educational facilities were spread&#13;
thir.ly over great distances. Also, education was assigned a major role&#13;
in nation-building, as wave upon wave of imuigrants from widely differing&#13;
backgrounds had to be absorbed into the system.   Under these circumstances,&#13;
the textbook became a major educational tool, a support for both the&#13;
student and teacher, and its development gave rise to educational publishing&#13;
techniques which can be of substantial assistance to the less developed&#13;
countries.&#13;
An example is the "teachers' edition," or -"teacher resource book,"&#13;
which today accompanies most basal primary or secondary school textbooks&#13;
published by responsible publishers in the United States, Canada, Europe,&#13;
Latin America, and parts of Asia and Africa.&#13;
- B. Commonly Used -Concepts and Terms&#13;
Since the publishing fraternity has its own jargon of technical terms&#13;
and concepts, we will define major terms used in this paper in the following&#13;
paragraphs. Anyone with publishing experience will have little difficulty&#13;
understanding and accepting these terms.&#13;
1.  Publishing embraces all activities common to an educational&#13;
publisher.  They include at the primarv and secondary levels:&#13;
Selecting an author team; coordinating and directing the efforts of&#13;
the author team; reviewing and testing submitted materials;&#13;
Determining-the aeneral appearance of the book or series (size, page&#13;
-   count, ormat, use of color); supervising the creatiofi of the artwork;&#13;
Specifying the typesetting;&#13;
Specifying and approving the color separation and f-lm-making;&#13;
Selecting text and cover materials (i.e., text and cover paper,&#13;
binding cloth, etc.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
Determining the specifications for printing and binding;&#13;
Determining the need for ancillary materials to accompany the student&#13;
textbook or series, such as,teachers' editions, workbooks, ditto&#13;
masters, flashcards, and other supplementary materials;&#13;
Determining the general appearance of the ancillary materials (size,&#13;
page count, format, use of illustration and color);&#13;
Establishing prices for all materials;&#13;
Planning and executing the marketing of the book or series;&#13;
Warehousing and distribution;&#13;
Providing editorial/marketing services which may include consulting&#13;
services, such as, workshops and presentations for teachers;&#13;
Collecting feedback from teachers once the book is in classroom use&#13;
for authors and editors for a possible revision or new edition,&#13;
or for publishing additional supplementary materials.&#13;
Within a publishing organization the title "publisher" is generally reserved&#13;
for the head of the house or the head of one of its divisions or groups.&#13;
2. Editorial comprises the activities of the publisher's editorial&#13;
department. In school publishing such activities typically include selection&#13;
of a publishing project and author team; coordinating and directing the work&#13;
of authors; reviewing, testing and, sometimes, rewriting the materials;&#13;
determining, in consultation with the authors, the design and layout in&#13;
addition to the size, format, etc., of the book or series; and supervising&#13;
the production of the materials.&#13;
The editorial team on a large basal series may consist of a project&#13;
director, project editors, and other editorial personnel, such as,copy&#13;
editors. In some publishing houses all the expenses of this group are&#13;
charged to the editorial department and included in the operating expenses&#13;
of the publisher, yet,in other instances,copy editing and certain other&#13;
editorial expenses may be charged directlv to the project in the form of&#13;
plant costs.&#13;
3. Production applies generally to the process of converting an edited&#13;
manuscript into film ready for plate-making, that is to say, it comprises&#13;
the stages of design, -llustration, typesetting, page make-up, and color&#13;
separation. Traditionally, publishers purchase some or many of these services&#13;
on the outside.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
4. Manufacture describes the process of preparing the physical book&#13;
package, i.e., specifying and procuring materials (paper, coverboard, etc.),&#13;
contracting for the services of a printer and binder, setting printing&#13;
schedules, and the supervision and quality control of printz.nag and binding&#13;
(in some houses,the latter aspect may be called production control).&#13;
5. Marketing and Promotion covers a wide range of activities from&#13;
research of the market needs to selling, promoting, and servicing the&#13;
published product. Through its sales force, its marketing managers, product&#13;
managers and consultants, an educational publisher stays in constant&#13;
communication with the school systems he serves; discovers their needs,&#13;
provides teachers and administrators alike with information and complimentary&#13;
copies of current publications, and gains acceptance of his textbooks. An&#13;
important function in educational publishing is to service textbook adoptions&#13;
through follow-up workshops organized for teachers and supervisors by trained&#13;
consultants.  The marketing department helps the editors to customize materials&#13;
for special locales; it collects data from schools, using the house's textbooks,&#13;
to improve the publication in its next revision cycle.&#13;
This constant give-and-take between schools and their teachers on the&#13;
one hand, and a publisher's representatives, editors, and consultants on the&#13;
other hand, is meant to assure that textbooks meet the general criteria of&#13;
current trends in teaching, and that they are effective teaching tools for&#13;
the average classroom. Frequent contact with schools nationwide alert the&#13;
publisher to shifts in methodology and approach which mav be .major, such as,&#13;
the current "return to basics" trend in the United States.&#13;
Textbooks should never be developed and produced in a vacuum, yet this&#13;
sometimes seems to be the case with government-sponsored projects.  Planners&#13;
and writers alike need to recognize that even "free" textbooks must be "sold"&#13;
to the teacher, be accepted by him, and need servicing. We will suggest&#13;
alternatives to a sales force for such public projects in later sections of&#13;
this paper. Meanwhile, it should be clear that educational publishers use&#13;
considerable creativity and spend considerable money in "marketing and sellina":&#13;
as much as an average of 20% of the net amount received by. the publisher&#13;
(see The Percentage Game) according to some industry statistics.&#13;
6. FulfilLment which embraces the two areas of "order processing"&#13;
(order editing, credit control, invoicing, and the maintaining of accounts&#13;
receivable), and "shipping and warehousina" is another important function&#13;
of a publisher.  Book distribution is often one of the most troublesome areas&#13;
for a publisher, and great differences exist in the way it is handled.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15-&#13;
Principally, the differences in distribution techniques depend on the type&#13;
of book involved, who purchases it, and on the facilities available to the&#13;
publisher. As a general rule, books are obtained through:&#13;
a. A wholesaler, jobber (supplying retailers), or textbook depository;&#13;
b. A bookstore or other retailer, such as, a drugstore, supermarket, etc.;&#13;
c. Directly from the publisher;&#13;
d. A book club or mail-order house;&#13;
e. A government agency that is distributing them free of charge, or&#13;
f. Even free of charge from a publisher who may be sending out large&#13;
scale samplings for adoption consideration.&#13;
Book distribution is complicated because books are heavy, bulky items in&#13;
relation to their value or price, are produced in all sizes and shapes, and&#13;
are easily damaged in transit. Distribution costs for books are therefore&#13;
considerable, unless special categories of book post are available to the&#13;
publisher at subsidized rates.&#13;
Another problem facing the publisher is the relatively small size of most&#13;
book orders he receives. At the extremes of this spectrum are single copy&#13;
orders accounting for the bulk of sales in certain areas of publishing, and&#13;
large adoption orders purchaseddirectly from the publisher by school systems.&#13;
However, even for a school publisher the average order may amount to only&#13;
$179.   Publishers must maintain a large inventoryof hundreds or even thousands&#13;
of titles which make temporary out-of-stock situations inevitable and further&#13;
complicate distribution.&#13;
No easy answers are possible to the problems which affect publisher,&#13;
bookstore, and consumer alike. In fact, major experiments are underway at&#13;
present in the industrialized nations to create order out of worsening chaos&#13;
due to the proliferation of titles, publishers, and outlets for books. EDP&#13;
(Electronic Data Processing), standardized ordering procedures, and inter-&#13;
national efforts to code books by publisher, such as, the ISBN system, are&#13;
part of these efforts.&#13;
Nevertheless, important principles may be stated that affect all publi-shing,&#13;
while further consideration will be given to this topic when we discuss the&#13;
special problems of the LDCs and of government publishing.&#13;
e    The first principle is that it is ultimately the responsbility of the&#13;
publisher to assure that his product reaches the consumer;&#13;
e    Seccndly, worldwide, with few if important exceptions, the bookstcre,&#13;
book distributor or wholesaler is the publishers' most important ally;&#13;

Agreement sponsored by UNESCO for the free flow of books) and actively&#13;
facilitate book distribution, for instance, throiugh a dependable&#13;
subsidized mail service.&#13;
7. General and Administrative normally includes general management,&#13;
accounting, EDP systems (computers), legal expenses, occupancy, fringe&#13;
benefits, and state and local taxes.&#13;
C. Definitions and Analvsis of Costs&#13;
Publishers generally recognize two major categories of expenses:&#13;
1. Cost of Sales, or Cost of Product, sometimes called Recurring Costs&#13;
because they "recur" every time a book is sold. Cost of Sales include&#13;
manufacturing expenses (paper, printing, and binding) and royalties to authors.&#13;
2.  Publishinq and Operating Expenses:&#13;
a.  Plant Costs (Pre-publication expenses or One-time Costs);&#13;
b. Editorial Expenses (some of which may be regarded as One-time Costs);&#13;
c. Marketing Expenses;&#13;
d.  Fulfillment, i.e., order processing, warehousing and shipping;&#13;
e. General and Administrative.&#13;
Not every publisher uses exactly these terms, which we exnlained on&#13;
previous pages, nor does each company allocate expenses in the same manner.&#13;
*Tax laws, for example, at times affect how expenses are written off; costing&#13;
procedures used for pricing books vary in different countries, and with&#13;
different types of books.  Nevertheless, "Recurring Costs" and "One-time Costs"&#13;
are a basic division of exzenses and an important accounting concept for all&#13;
publishers, not yet sufficiently recognized in the planning of textbook projects.&#13;
Shipping costs connected with forwarding bocks to the customer, bookstore,&#13;
or school are cenerallv added to the customer's bill and therefore not&#13;
-zarr of operating exzerses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

1. Cost of Sales - Recurring Costs. In the view of many publishers,&#13;
controlling recurring costs, especially manufacturing expenses,is more&#13;
critical to the financial success of a project and requires even tighter&#13;
budgetary control than Plant Costs or One-time Costs. Yet, manufacturing&#13;
costs are generally accepted without much question by project planners and&#13;
government authorities, who have little experience with controlling such&#13;
costs.  We have seen proposed budgets   that included as much as $127 million&#13;
for paper, printing, and binding, and $20.8 million for buildings, furniture&#13;
and equipment, but only $2.5 million for all professional services, including&#13;
technical assistance and teacher training, an almost certain prescription&#13;
for failure.&#13;
Controlling manufacturing costs begins at the planning stage of a&#13;
textbook project when decisions are made concerning size, format, number&#13;
of pages, use of color, illustrations, and teachers' editions. Careful&#13;
consideration and investigation of methods of production and of manufacturing,&#13;
including the selection of a suitable paper and binding, at this stage save&#13;
a great deal of money later on. It is absolutely essential to emphasize&#13;
this point because paper and related materials, as well as labor costs, are&#13;
continually rising in the printing industry. An awesome sum of money is&#13;
spent for manufacturing over the life of a basal textbook series.&#13;
Royalties, another part of Recurring Costs, are paid to authors as&#13;
compensation for their creativity and for the amount of actual writing they&#13;
contribute to the development of a given textbook. Royalties are defined&#13;
by most publishers as a percentage of the net amount he receives from the&#13;
salesof the book (see the Percentage Game on a subsequent page for&#13;
explanation). They vary by country and by classification of book, and&#13;
are therefore difficult to generalize. If more than one author is involved,&#13;
as is generally the case in school publishing, the total royalty to be paid&#13;
will be shared by prior agreement by the author team in proportion to the&#13;
individual author's contribution to the Work. State publishing enterprises,&#13;
and the national publishing houses of the Socialist countries may pay a&#13;
flat fee to their authors instead of a royalty, sometimes based on a word&#13;
count, the level and size of the manuscript.&#13;

Successful school textbook authors may have the following in common&#13;
with successful authors of other "bestsellers": writing, and the research&#13;
connected with it, is likely to become their full time occupation. Needless&#13;
to say, this is most desirable for the project and for the p.blisher. It&#13;
must be appreciated that the writing of a basal series, or a set of secondary&#13;
school books,demands considerable time, dedication, and effort on the part&#13;
of the author. Nor does his involvement end with the publication of the&#13;
Work. Many tim.es the author's services will be needed in presenting the&#13;
Work to groups of teachers, or in giving workshops. In almost all cases,&#13;
he will be kept busy writing supplementary materials, the need for which&#13;
only becomes evident once the series is in use. In addition, he will be&#13;
requested to prepare minor revisions of the Work as new printings are&#13;
scheduled. A year or two after publication, a major revision may.be&#13;
initiated, not only to make the series more competitive, but rather because&#13;
its mass use in classrooms of different kinds may have exposed weaknesses&#13;
in the structure of the series, the exposition of certain concepts, the&#13;
progression of difficulty, reading level, and so forth. These "faults"&#13;
are then remedied inma first major revision, usually published within five&#13;
years of the first edition, at least, this is the case in the USA.&#13;
Paying a royalty to the author keeps him involved with his Work.&#13;
Occasionally, as he may have to forego teaching during the writing of the&#13;
series, the publisher will provide an advance against expected royalties&#13;
to allow the author to concentrate exclusively on writing material for&#13;
the series.&#13;
Royalty rates are fairly standard in most countries. In the USA,&#13;
the range is:&#13;
Elementary School Texts&#13;
(to be shared by the author team):     5 to 7% of Net*&#13;
High School Texts:                        7 to 10% of Net&#13;
Basic College Texts:                     15 to 20% of Net&#13;
In setting a royalty rate one should be concerned that the author is&#13;
sufficiently motivated to put forth his best effort and can afford to give&#13;
the project the time and dedication necessary.&#13;
In commercial publishing, there is, of course, cuite an element of chance,&#13;
An author may get little in return for years of hard work on a text which&#13;
is not successful in the marketplace; on the other hand, he may receive a&#13;
*Net sales of the Work as received by the publisher.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19.-&#13;
reasonable return, or he may strike it rich if his book becomes'widely&#13;
adopted. In government publishing, where the market may be huge and&#13;
guaranteed, the element of chance may be lacking, but the principle of&#13;
good pay for good work must prevail, and a means must be found to keep&#13;
authors involved with a project on a continuing basis.&#13;
2. Publishing and Operating Expenses.&#13;
a. Plant Costs or Pre-publication Expenses are called One-time&#13;
Costs because they comprise those expenses incurred by the publisher&#13;
in the publication of a book which remain the same whether he prints&#13;
one' copy or a million copies. They may be considerable. In school&#13;
publishing, One-time Costs include all project-related expenses&#13;
incurred from the inception of the editorial process to the time the&#13;
final plate-making film is submitted to the chosen printer, i.e.,&#13;
manuscript review and testing, manuscript preparation and re-writing,&#13;
designing, illustrating, typesetting, proofreading, dummying, color&#13;
separation, and film-making.&#13;
As an example, a typical U.S. basal mathematics series, printed in&#13;
four colors and consisting of seven levels, kindergarten through Grade 6,&#13;
including workbooks and teachers' editions, may well cost the publisher&#13;
$2 million in plant costs alone. Most of these monies are paid for&#13;
outside artwork, design, illustrations, photographs, composition, colcr&#13;
separatioPk and film-making. In addition, since it may take on the&#13;
average three-to-five years to prepare such a series, editorial expenses,&#13;
consisting mostly of the salaries and 'expenses of a highly trained&#13;
professional staff, may add another $1.5 million to pre-publication costs.&#13;
Looking at these costs from another point of view, more or less 2,000&#13;
pages of student text will have to be prepared for such a series, each&#13;
individually written, designed, illustrated and closely checked, in&#13;
addition to 400 pages of workbooks (for Grades 3-6 only), plus '3,000&#13;
pages of detailed teachers' editions, each page reproducing student text&#13;
pages, plus explanations and commentary, stating objectives, activities&#13;
and so forth.&#13;
Clearly, editorial and plant expenses represent a considerable&#13;
investment on the part of the publisher.   On large projects, One-time Costs&#13;
may be amortized over- the lifetime of an edition, aenerally, 4-5 years. On&#13;
small projects, they mav be treated as part cf the cost of a first orinting.&#13;

Comparing the pre-publication costs of the large, glossy, permanent,&#13;
hardbound textbooks presently popular in the United States to conditions&#13;
in the LDCs may mean little in itself. However, the following consider-&#13;
ations are of crucial importance to developing countries in assessing&#13;
how much they should spend on the preparation of textbooks for primarv&#13;
or secondary grades:&#13;
*   The development of an effective textbook depends foremost on the&#13;
work of a capable author team, advised and supported by all the.&#13;
expertise and services paid for out of editorial and plant&#13;
expenses. Such a task becomes increasingly complex if the&#13;
textbook or basal series is to be generally suitable for all&#13;
students in a given school system and is to be accepted by their&#13;
teachers as a useful educational tool, or where few alternatives&#13;
or supplementary materials are available.&#13;
*   Pre-publication costs (plant and editorial expenses) may amount&#13;
on the average to only 10% of the net sales of a widely used&#13;
basal series, or possibly 13% of the total cost of publishing&#13;
the Work. These percentages could well be used as a yardstick&#13;
for publishing projects in developing countries.&#13;
Publishing and Operating Expenses, other than One-time Costs, cover&#13;
all service and administrative functions of a publishing house. They&#13;
include:&#13;
b. Editorial expenses, which are not project-related, as described&#13;
earlier, but which are for research and development leading to new&#13;
publishing projects;&#13;
c. Marketing and promotion expenses incurred for promoting the&#13;
textbook to teachers and schools, for providing various services, such&#13;
as, seminars and workshops, and for the gathering of feedback from&#13;
schools helpful in the preparation of a revision   or of supplementary&#13;
materials;&#13;
d. FulfilLment, as described earlier.&#13;
e.  General  and Administrative Expenses.&#13;
D. The Percentage Game&#13;
There apoears to be a great deal of confusion when comparing the costs&#13;
of publishing industries of d-fferent countries, or even the costs among&#13;
publishers of the same countrv. For instance, expenses may be stated in&#13;
several ways:  as a percentage of the lisz price of a book; as a percentage&#13;
of its net price; or even as a percentage of its total cost. Therefore, when&#13;
comparisons are made one must always ascertain which base is being used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
List price is defined as the price stated by the publisher in his&#13;
price list, as the price printed on the jacket of the book, or as the&#13;
price normally charged by the retailer.&#13;
Net price, or net amount received, is the amount the publisher&#13;
actually receives after discount from the retailer or ultimate customer.&#13;
It is more common for publishers to state costs as a percentage&#13;
of the net amount received. Many industry statistics are based on&#13;
this principle even though royalties may, in fact, be paid on the list&#13;
price in some instances, such as, in trade publishing.&#13;
At times, it is useful to examine the expenses of a publishing&#13;
project (pre-publication costs, manufacturing expenses, etc.) as a&#13;
percentage of the total cost of the book, disregarding the profit margin&#13;
normally built into commercial pricing. This is especially helpful when&#13;
evaluating government projects. Therefore, we sometimes talk in terms of&#13;
percentages of total cost in this paper.&#13;
To illustrate the percentage game, we present the following Table&#13;
(Table 1), using as an example a school textbook with a list price of&#13;
U.S. $2.00 and a net price of U.S. $1.50. The figures demonstrate how&#13;
carefully one must define the cost base.&#13;
The first column represents the standard calculation used by many&#13;
publishers, which is based on net price or net amount received by the&#13;
publisher; the second column analvzes these costs on the basis of list price,&#13;
assuming a 25% discount to the distributor; the third column shows the same&#13;
expenses as percentagesof total cost.&#13;

* Manufacturing costs, chiefly paper, printing, and binding, account for&#13;
roughly one third of the total costs of publishing textbooks;&#13;
Plant costs, editorial costs, and royalties are substantial, amounting&#13;
to approximately 20% of costs;&#13;
e Publishers incur other considerable costs summarized as marketing,&#13;
which pay for introducing the textbook to teachers and school systems,&#13;
and for'fulfillment.&#13;
It may' be argued that the above figures have little relevancy to the&#13;
economics of publishing in the LDCs.&#13;
We have seen few statistics from such countries. The only report on the&#13;
economics of publishing in the developing countries of which we are aware is the&#13;
1&#13;
pioneering study written-by Datus C. Smith, Jr., and published by UNESCO in 1977&#13;
Datus Smith's study concerns itself with commercial publishing for which he collected&#13;
information fromipublishers in thirty countries of Asia, Latin America, the Middle&#13;
East, and Africa. Most of the publishers represented are fairly small enterprises,&#13;
and are more akin to trade than to educational publishers. The average number of&#13;
copies produced and sold by said publishers is relatively small, ranging from&#13;
1,000 to 10,000 copy editions. Nevertheless, the statistics contained in the report&#13;
are most instructive and relevant to this paper. The table which follows is excerpted&#13;
from Mr. Smith's report, and is based on 10,000 copy editions:&#13;

For easier comparison we have assumed that U.S. Trade Publishers&#13;
grant an average discount of 31% (it is closer to 40%), and we have re-&#13;
stated the percentages given in the U.S. industry statistics to reflect&#13;
list price rather than net price. If one takes into account that pub-&#13;
lishing companies in developing countries are generally family-owned,&#13;
and therefore, management expenses, interest on invested capital, etc.,&#13;
are likely to be taken out of profits rather than listed as general ex-&#13;
penses, the percentages listed are astonishingly similar.&#13;
Another statistic in Datus Smith's important study provides the&#13;
following breakdown:&#13;
Manufacturing and Non-manufacturing Cost&#13;
(Per cent of list price)&#13;
Manufacturing       29.3%&#13;
Non-manufacturing 70.7&#13;
100.0%&#13;
Summary: It is important to analyze all costs carefully when under-&#13;
taking a publishing project. Even a cursory examination will reveal&#13;
that for many countries and types of publishing, close to 30% of all costs&#13;
is spent on manufacturing the book; the remaining 70% covers all other&#13;
expenses, including royalties to authors.&#13;

III. Publishing for Schools: The Challenge&#13;
We begin this section by listing commonly asked questions. The&#13;
following paragraphs and pages provide comments and explanations, which&#13;
even though generally true and accepted, are not necessarily true in&#13;
all cases, nor are they always accepted by everyone.&#13;
A. Commonly Asked Questions&#13;
*   Why is publishing for primary and secondary schools so complex?&#13;
* Why is it more difficult to write good textbooks at these levels?&#13;
* Why does it take so long, and cost so much money?&#13;
*   Is it not true that any schoolbook is better than none?&#13;
*   Is a good teacher not more important than good textbooks?&#13;
* Of how much help is a good book in the hands of a bad teacher?&#13;
B. Comments and Explanations&#13;
*   Publishing for primary and secondary schools is complex because&#13;
the goal is an integrated basal program, a series of texts, workbooks, teachers'&#13;
editions, and other supplementary aids in a given major subject area, intended&#13;
to cover the needs of a broad spectrum of-students over the entire range of&#13;
the Kindergarten through Grade 10 school curriculum or, at least, major parts&#13;
of it (Grades 1-6),&#13;
*   It is difficult towrite texts of aDprooriate   content and level,&#13;
consistent in approach, method and exposition, properly sequenced, motivating&#13;
for the student, readily taught by the less qualified teacher, yet capable&#13;
of extension through the efforts of a good teacher.&#13;
Primarv school books inform and form children throughout their most&#13;
critical learning stages, if we exempt pre-school education.   They deal wit.h&#13;
young cq.ildren who lack experience and soohistication, have a limited vocabulary,&#13;
an even more limited ability to read, and a very short attention span which&#13;
increases only gradually. These children areeasily confused; as Piaget has&#13;
shown, thev must be taught concepts in a progression which parallels their&#13;
stages of development and maturity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
* Meeting the criteria for an effective text becomes a lengthy and&#13;
difficult task of writing and testing content, assuring clear, graphic&#13;
presentation, and short learning units. Since content matter is low-level&#13;
and often faikly standard, emphasis is placedon teachability,on presentation,&#13;
on motivation, on creative design and organization, i.e., the way in which&#13;
concepts and content are introduced, exercises are graded and integrated,&#13;
the functional use of design, color, and illustrations.&#13;
* We expect a great deal from our school system and our textbook;&#13;
suffice it to say they both generally fall short of perfection. Nevertheless,&#13;
to argue that a bad school system is better than no schoolsystem, begs the&#13;
question.  To carry the argument to its logical extreme, a bad school system&#13;
might thwart relevant education and training in the home and the community.&#13;
By the same token,bad books could and indeed often do sour a young mind on&#13;
"book learning" for life. They may trigger reading blocks and other learning&#13;
disabilities.&#13;
Surely we must aim for a serviceable learning tool which can be improved&#13;
as it is used in the classroom, revised, extended and adapted to changing&#13;
circumstances, or to new insights into the learning process.&#13;
* Publishers appreciate that a good teacher is more important than&#13;
a good textbook, and that an outstanding teacher may need little outside&#13;
support. However, in an imperfect world, outstanding teachers are rare.&#13;
At the primary level, teachers are often limited in education, background,&#13;
and experience. In developing countries, teachers are generally over-burdened,&#13;
underpaid, and have little more education than their 8th grade students. They&#13;
need all of the assistance that can be built into carefully prepared textbooks.&#13;
* Whether a textbook is helpful in the hands of an indifferent teacher&#13;
depends to a large extent on the care and professionalism with which it has&#13;
been prepared. If content and presentation are based on a realistic assessment&#13;
of the abilities of the average teacher in the system, texts may be designed&#13;
that are almost self-teachina and depend only marginally on the abilities&#13;
of the teacher. Teachers' editions can be written which guide the teacher&#13;
step-by-step through all relevant classroom activities, broaden his knowledge,&#13;
and provide for needed confidence.   'nonetheless, textbooks and teachers'&#13;
editions are not meant to replace the teacher, but rather to provide basic&#13;
knowledge which children must learn in a motivating and digestible manner,&#13;
leaving the teacher free to help the slow learner or to enrich the learning&#13;
process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
Publishing for schools might be easier if we could find the "perfect"&#13;
author, the "local teacher" who in the lore of development specialists,&#13;
is alone capable cf writing meaningful texts because he knows his students&#13;
and their cultural background. Looking for the "perfect" author who might&#13;
write a basal series on his own, we would expect the following:&#13;
He is a master classroom teacher who has empathy for the needs&#13;
and capabilities of the average teacher in the system he serves.&#13;
He appreciates the needs of not only his own classroom, school,&#13;
county, but also broadly differing needs of other schools far&#13;
removed from his own. He relates well to his own students, yet&#13;
has had opportunity of access to students from a variety of&#13;
backgrounds, from urban as well as rural areas, of differing&#13;
religious and cultural persuasions, from dissimilar layers of&#13;
society, who are motivated by disparate educational and career&#13;
goals.&#13;
The "perfect" author obviously is well versed in the subject&#13;
matter he teaches, and at the level at which he teaches it.&#13;
Nevertheless, he has a much broader understanding of the basic&#13;
concepts and language of his field, mathematics, for example,&#13;
in order to enable him to project his series ahead through 6&#13;
to 8 grades, to plan its integration and development in such a&#13;
way that students using his books are well prepared for the fol-&#13;
lowing levels of the math curriculum be they at secondary level,&#13;
for those terminating, or at tertiary level for those continuing.&#13;
Besides a basic knowledge of his subject (mathematics), the&#13;
author is something of a reading specialist, well aware that&#13;
reading levels must match the developmental stages of the child&#13;
as precisely as the mathematics he presents. He writes well, in&#13;
clear, simple terms, with consistency of style and of presenta-&#13;
tion. He is inventive and develops his content in novel ways.&#13;
He devises problems and exercises which are meaningful and moti-&#13;
vating to his students, including games, puzzles, non-verbal&#13;
clues and other such devices. He provides simple, self-testing&#13;
sections, and writes a straiahtforward teachers' guide transmit-&#13;
ting his views,attitudes and teaching methods in a convincing,&#13;
easy-to-follow style to thousands of teachers he can never know&#13;
zersonally.&#13;

This ideal author understands the critical difference between&#13;
being a good classroom teacher and the challenge of having to&#13;
teach through the pa;es of a book, quite a different task&#13;
requiring experience in textbook writing, and the skill and&#13;
background previously outlined.&#13;
Needless to say, such a combination of skills is difficult if not&#13;
impossible to find in a single person.&#13;
Therefore, it has become -he practice of educational publishers to&#13;
select teams of authors who among themselves contribute a wide variety&#13;
of skills, and to support such author teams with experienced editors,&#13;
designers, reviewers, and other specialists who assist and guide the&#13;
development of their work.&#13;

IV. Publishing for Schools: The Institution and Process&#13;
A. Summing Up&#13;
As we proceed in this paper from the general to the particular, we&#13;
focus more extensively on school publishing because of its fundamental&#13;
importance to the development of a country.&#13;
We realize that primary textbooks should be published as integrated&#13;
basal series, because it would be difficult to patch together appropriately&#13;
consistent and sequenced coverage of the primary school curricula with&#13;
independently authored books for each subject area in each grade level.&#13;
We have seen that author teams developed because no single person&#13;
can be expected to create all of the material necessary for a series of&#13;
textbooks spanning 6-8 years.&#13;
Publishing organizations provide the necessary investment, the continuity&#13;
and accumulation of experience, the professional staff to assist and guide&#13;
authors who themselves often are novices at writing textbooks. They,furthermore,&#13;
produce, market, distribute, and service the final product.&#13;
On the following pages, we outline a typical textbook publishing organiza-&#13;
tion, detail the make-up of an editorial department, and follow the flow of&#13;
work in the preparation of an edition.&#13;
The reader is bound to question whether all this apparatus is necessary,&#13;
whether shortcuta are available, and how LDCs can afford such a prolonged&#13;
and costly process. Alternatives to very expensive materials and shortcuts&#13;
to their development are indeed possible once the process is thoroughly&#13;
understood and the publisher knowledgeable. In a small country, with a long&#13;
tradition of learning, a reasonably homogeneous and stablegopulation, and an&#13;
established teaching profession, writing and publishing textbooks becomes a&#13;
much simnlertask. This is especially true if models exist which provide the&#13;
basis for each succeeding stage of textbook development.&#13;
The major developing nations are not in such a fortunate position.&#13;
Their societies are in transition, their goals differ and are changing,&#13;
their school populations often are not homogeneous or stable but are exploding&#13;
in numbers. These nations tend to incorporate extremes of wealth and poverty,&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

education and ignorance, urban and rural areas. New national languages&#13;
are being created in some countries, on a basis unfamiliar to large&#13;
segments of the population, and introduced as the medium of instruction&#13;
at primary school levels with little prior preparation. More than any&#13;
other nations, the developing countries should be able to rely on adequate&#13;
educational materials. If this demand is to be satisfied, LDCs, with the&#13;
support of The World Bank and other sources of assistance, must spend the&#13;
time and provide the incentives for the establishment of viable publishing&#13;
industries. They need to give priority to:&#13;
*   Regularly  purchasing    textbooks and other printed materials,&#13;
at least, for their primary school populations and school&#13;
libraries;&#13;
*   Introducing legislation favorable to the development of professional&#13;
publishing instituticns;&#13;
*   Providing technical know-how,training, and other resources;&#13;
*   Promoting the use of books and the reading habit in general.&#13;
More will be said about government's role in later sections of this paper.&#13;

In a small organization one staff member may wear several hats,&#13;
i.e., fill several positions. A large organization tends more toward&#13;
specialization, with department heads and general management responsi-&#13;
ble for overall policies and coordination.&#13;
There appears to be a direct relationship between the total number&#13;
of staff members in a publishing organization and its total volume of&#13;
sales. This .relationship is generally expressed as sales per employee.&#13;
For a number of reasons, this ratio varies widely among the publishing&#13;
industries of different countries and, to a lesser extent, between&#13;
different publishers, such as, Trade and Educational. As an example,&#13;
the following figures are taken from the 1977 Industry Statistics of the&#13;
Association of American Publishers, and the ICC Business Ratios for&#13;
1976/77.&#13;
1977 Net Sales per Employee, U.S Publishers.&#13;
Trade Book Publishers                        US $86.181&#13;
Professional Book Publishers&#13;
Technical, Scientific, Business, Medical    $83.795&#13;
Elementary/High School (ELHI) Publishers        $78.541&#13;
College Publishers                              $88.301&#13;
1977 Net Sales per Employee, British Publishers.2&#13;
Weighted averages for British publishers as a whole were apparently&#13;
US $35.000&#13;
however, figures varied greatly among different publishing companies.&#13;
C. Editorial Department (Chart 2)&#13;
The Editorial Department of aschool publisher provides, especially&#13;
for inexperienced authors, accumulated knowledge acquired over years of&#13;
producing textbooks. This would include experience with a wide variety&#13;
of visual presentations, a feeling for current trends in the school sys-&#13;
tem, awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of other textbooks, first-&#13;
hand acquaintance with a broad sampling of classrooms throughout the&#13;
country, and expertise in book design and production.&#13;

At school level, the project editor of a textbook series is fre-&#13;
quently a former teacher. He or she reads every word in the manuscripts,&#13;
questions every concept and presentation he or she does not understand&#13;
or thinks is not sufficiently explained. But,perhaps,the editor's great-&#13;
est contributions are reading the material provided by the authors with&#13;
the average pupil in mind and by assisting in the preparation of teachers'&#13;
editions.&#13;
While the editor critically examines the content, he/she is equally&#13;
concerned with presentation and design, with all of the devices which&#13;
make for better textbooks.&#13;
The most common pitfall in school publishing is expecting too much from&#13;
teachers and pupils. Examples abound of textbooks and series which have&#13;
failed because student texts or teachers' editions were too difficult in&#13;
subject presentation or reading level, or introduced new concepts or&#13;
methodologies too rapidly for traditionally conservative school systems&#13;
and teachers to absorb and accept.&#13;
Once a textbook or series has been introduced and failed, it be-&#13;
comes difficult, if not impossible, to get it accepted in revised form.&#13;
For textbook author and publisher, it is far better to underestimate&#13;
the capabilities and degree of motivation of the average classroom tea-&#13;
cher and pupil than to overrate such caDacities and motivation.&#13;
A textbook series which is successfully introduced and widely used&#13;
gains great credibility. It may be readily revised ar improved, it may&#13;
be updated and made more rigorous if trends in teaching so demand.&#13;

D. Publishing Process Simplified (Chart 3)&#13;
Quote: "From the evidence so far, the availability of books appears&#13;
to be the most consistent school factor in predicting academic&#13;
achievement. It is positive in 15 out of the 18 statistics (83%).&#13;
This is, for example, more favorable than the 13 out of 24 (54%)&#13;
reported recently for teacher training."1&#13;
Thus wrote the authors reviewing the published evidence from less&#13;
industrialized societies on the relationship between textbook availability&#13;
and academic achievement.&#13;
These conclusions from a World Bank Staff Working Paper are daily&#13;
confirmed in thousands of classrooms throughout the industrialized nations&#13;
where the textbook remains the main teaching tool.&#13;
We have pointed out before that the creation of effective texts and&#13;
related materials is a complex process. Beginning with Chart 3, the fol-&#13;
lowing pages quickly summarize saliernt features of the school publishing&#13;
process for those who plan and review textbook projects.&#13;
1.  Primary and Secondary School Publishing.     There are both simi-&#13;
larities and differences in publishing at these levels. The similarities:&#13;
A series of schoolbooks whether at primary or-secondary level, has to&#13;
be consistent in approach, method and exposition, and appropriately se-&#13;
quenced. This consistency may sound easy to attain, but in reality is ex-&#13;
tremely difficult to achieve, with most any team of authors. Hence, the&#13;
roles of a Senior Author and/or the Project Editor become crucial. (See&#13;
Chart.)&#13;
The differences: Primary school differs from secondary school&#13;
publishing in that nearly always a complete series, Kindergarten - Grade 6&#13;
or Kindergarten - Grade 8, must be planned. It must be highly graphic for&#13;
this age level. Essentially, at the lower levels, a page constitutes&#13;
a unit of learning, sometimes less than a page. Content matter is low&#13;
level, and fairly standard.   Therefore, emphasis is placed on presenta-&#13;
tion, on motivation, on creativity in the manner in which concepts and&#13;
content are introduced', exercises are chosen and graded, and the way in&#13;
which colcr, des-gn and illustration are employed. A good pr:imary&#13;

school editor needs a graphic eye to enhance the principal objective,&#13;
which is to publish a product which is pedagogically sound but which&#13;
also will hold the interest of the pupil as well as instruct him/her.&#13;
From Kindergarten to Grade 2, serious consideration should be&#13;
given to publishing materials as consumable texts or write-in work-&#13;
books, at least in some subject areas. If consumable books sound waste-&#13;
ful and expensive even when there are sound pedagogical reasons for this&#13;
approach, it is well to remember that consumable texts can be inex-&#13;
pensively produced, substitute for both student text and exercise book,&#13;
and that in any event, the life expectancy of a cheaply produced paper-&#13;
bound primer in the hands of a 5 or 6 year old is rarely more than a&#13;
year. For primary textbooks color is very important to interest the&#13;
child and introduce him/her to the world of learning through books.&#13;
Secondary school publishing is more subject matter oriented,&#13;
and teaching is usually done by subject matter specialists: Author&#13;
teams are smaller, perhaps with only two coauthors per title. Each&#13;
title usually is written independently, except for the first years of secondary&#13;
school in some countries where Math I and II, General Science I and II, for&#13;
example, constitute a series and may in fact be an extension of the&#13;
primary program. Nevertheless, a good editor remains crucial, especially&#13;
with less experienced authors, to ensure consistency, clarity of presen-&#13;
tation, and sequential progression. In addition, as illustrations are&#13;
verym.uch a part of the content, the editor, together with the author, out-&#13;
lines to the designer-illustrator exactly what is wanted, and may even&#13;
search for suitable illustrations.&#13;
2.  Teachers' Editions.     School teachers universally need assis-&#13;
tance, and today most educational publishers in the industrialized na-&#13;
tions recognize the need to supply TEs at low cost or free of&#13;
charae to each teacher -- at all levels of primary and for most secondary&#13;
school teaching, and in all subject areas. However, teachers will actually&#13;
make use of TEs only if they are simple, organized in a straichtforward&#13;
manner by unit or lesson, and orovide answers and solutions to problems&#13;
and exercises.&#13;
Typically Teachers' Editions begin by explaining the general pur-&#13;
Dose of the series or book often including a scope and sequence chart,&#13;
and then proceed to suggest a methodology for teaching the subject mat-&#13;
ter. For example, a grachic representation o` the methodology for a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
mathematics course might be presented as follows in a Teachers' Edition&#13;
(see Illustration, Page 39). Next might follow an introduction to each&#13;
section or unit. This would probably state objectives, r-view the&#13;
mathematical principles involved, and give suggestions for teaching,&#13;
including a list of useful teaching aids or materials for the teacher to&#13;
have the students gather from various sources.&#13;
At a lower level, general activities and/or games may be outlined next.&#13;
Then follows information on teaching specific lessons (at elementary&#13;
level) or units and chapters (at higher levels). For each lesson teaching&#13;
objectives may be explained and suggestions may be given for preliminary&#13;
and follow-up activities. Pages of the textbook are generally reproduced,&#13;
even in reduced size, in the Teachers' Editions. This greatly enhances&#13;
the TEs' appeal to teachers. They can now use the Teachers' Edition in&#13;
the classroom without having to refer to the pupils' text also. It is&#13;
important to save teachers work, and to reduce the time they need to&#13;
prepare for each lesson -- instead, a good Teachers' Edition allows&#13;
teachers to concentrate on helping pupils and on supplementary activities..&#13;
Teachers' Editions should be drafted or outlined by the authors, but&#13;
may need especially careful review and intense editing by the publisher.&#13;
In general, authors know their materials too well, believe there are no&#13;
pitfalls in their presentation, and assume too much from teacher and&#13;
pupil. The editor keeps in mind the needs of average or even poorly&#13;
prepared teachers and offers them assistance through the Teachers' Edition.&#13;

3.  General Guidelines.      The development of new and effective tea-&#13;
ching materials is at the heart of educational publishing. Steps in the&#13;
publisher's development of a new series or title designed for a specific&#13;
educational purpose should include the following:&#13;
a. Assemble available data upon which to base a publishing design,&#13;
i.e., student enrollments, capabilities and needs of teachers and&#13;
students, available textbooks in the marketplace.&#13;
b. inauire into teaching trends, the direction they are moving, who&#13;
are the movers, which group is the most influential, where your&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
authors and reviewers are likely to come from.&#13;
c.  Blueprint a possible pedagogical presentation and the physical&#13;
"package," i.e., whether consumable or non-consumable; number&#13;
of texts, workbooks, lab manuals, visuals; whether a series or&#13;
a single text; basic design, format and size, approximate&#13;
number of pages; use of color, etc.&#13;
d.  Furnish preliminary specifications to prospective authors for&#13;
discussion, i.e., outline of table of contents, curriculum guide,&#13;
suggested scope and sequence chart of series, length of average&#13;
lesson, length of total course, a design which suggests the or-&#13;
ganization of units, chapters, etc.&#13;
e.  Provide background on the previous knowledge to be assumed on&#13;
the part of the pupil, desired reading level, rigor, etc.&#13;
4.  Determining Scope and Size of a Project, Single Text, or Series.&#13;
Before commencing writing, author, editor, and publisher should agree on&#13;
the parameters of the project, to ensure its usefulness in the classroom.&#13;
A fairly detailed set of specifications as to content and presentation&#13;
should be developed, and exposed to critical comments.&#13;
a.  Developing the Specifications for Content&#13;
1)  Assess what materials are already in use, their shortcomings&#13;
and strengths. No publisher in his right mind starts from&#13;
scratch. Everyone examines what has already been done success-&#13;
fully.'&#13;
2)  Consider current trends in education and study curriculum re-&#13;
quirements to determine in which ways your series will be an&#13;
improvement over what alreadv exists. Since he/she must plan&#13;
for a publication four to six years before it will become avai-&#13;
lable in the classroom, a good Executive Editor must antici-&#13;
pate new developments and be careful that his/her product, when&#13;
published, will be neither too far ahead of current trends nor&#13;
behind them.&#13;
3)  Establish a scope and seauence (if a series) or a detailed out-&#13;
line (if a single text) that will set forth pedagogical and cur-&#13;
riculum objectives.&#13;
4) Secure an evaluation of this outline from teachers, supervisors&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
and specialists in the field.&#13;
5) Revise the nrooosal to the satisfaction of such experts and&#13;
potential users of the material.&#13;
b.  Developing the Method of Presentation.     Once the scope of the&#13;
project has been decided, the method of presentation needs to be&#13;
considered. Before a physical format can be determined, these&#13;
questions need to be answered. (Presume a primary level series):&#13;
1)  Is the mate-ial best-suited-to a structured sequence in a stan-&#13;
dard text format (non-consumable)?&#13;
2) Or, would the objectives of the program be better satisfied by&#13;
having the student consume the pages in a pre-determined order,&#13;
as in a workbook format?&#13;
3) Or, could some or most of the objectives be satisfied by having&#13;
a file, box , of directed activities on durable paper stock&#13;
arranged in such a way that the sequence can be easily changed&#13;
for flexibility in the management of the course?&#13;
4) Would the introduction of some of the concepts lend themselves&#13;
to an "expert" demonstration (more professional than the average&#13;
teacher might be equipped to present) and, therefore, warrant&#13;
having some "canned" film strips, audio or video tapes, etc.,&#13;
in the program? (Vocational training or career education come&#13;
to mind as subjects suitable for this approach.)&#13;
5) Is there a combination of the above techniques that should be&#13;
employed?&#13;
6) Is color a factor? Will a 2-color presentation enhance the&#13;
learning process, or are there sections or materials that de-&#13;
pend upon 4-color presentation (certain science unlts, for&#13;
example)?&#13;
c.  Assessinq the Feasibility of the Presentation (Including Costs)&#13;
U7on completion of the two check lists previously mentioned, it&#13;
now becomes necessarv to decide how to produce the series.    Limits&#13;
in terms of the cost of the end-oroduct must be established, in-&#13;
ciuding estimated costs for artwork, composition, film, plates,&#13;
paper, printing, binding, marketing and distribution. This&#13;
*nformat_or. needs to be combined on a costing sheet showing the&#13;
estimated sales irn number of copies at estimated net prices&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
(list price less discount) over the lifetime of the edition,&#13;
normally set at five years. Most textbooks and series need to&#13;
be revised within five years, incurring renewed costs.&#13;
Direct   costs for such a calculation are relatively easy to es-&#13;
tablish since they consist mostly of money that will actually be&#13;
spent on some concrete aspect of the product (editorial, plant,&#13;
manufacturing, and royalties). However, indirect costs are just as&#13;
important. They include administrative overhead, rent, fringe&#13;
benefits for staff, sales, promotion, warehousing,- distribution, and&#13;
shipping and billing costs. Only when all these items have been con-&#13;
sidered and weighed, can a sound publishing decision be made, and&#13;
realistic specifications for the project drawn up.&#13;
A serious consideration, especially in estimating the time it will&#13;
take to complete the project as well as its general feasibility, is&#13;
the availablity of competent talent: authors, writers, editors, pro-&#13;
ject directors, production supervisors, graphic designers, illustra-&#13;
tors, and photographers -- who together will have the skill to flesh&#13;
out the proposal. into a useful and wanted series of texts.&#13;
d. Producing the Product&#13;
The publisher's principal objective in producing a new series should&#13;
be to publish materials that (a) are pedagogically sound, (b) attrac-&#13;
tive to the learner, (c) encompass a number of modern features designed&#13;
to place the series in the forefront of its competitors, and (d) will&#13;
have a reasonably long term of usefulness in the classroom. This sec-&#13;
tion deals with aspects of producing a successful series meeting these&#13;
criteria.&#13;
1)  Authors and Editors.     A book is only as gcod as its author(s).&#13;
To ensure that the product will be effective and succeed in the&#13;
marketplace, good authorship is essential. And, to accelerate&#13;
the completion of the manuscript, a contributing and coordinating&#13;
editorial staff should work parallel with the author team.&#13;
As the authors write the basic lesson content, the editorial team&#13;
may contribute ideas for problems   and the necessary directicn&#13;
of the work, exercises, and additional material reauired to&#13;
complete the manuscript (capticns, chapter head notes, etc.) and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
prepare the Teachers' Edition, tape scripts, film strips, and&#13;
other ancillary materials. A senior author or editor should&#13;
always review the basic writing of the team members to assure&#13;
uniformity of style and terminology.&#13;
2) Production Manager and Art Director. It is essential that the&#13;
Production Manager and Art Director be involved in the early&#13;
planning of a project. They must be able to suggest alternate&#13;
ways of producing. a project and of satisfying essential features&#13;
demanded by authors and editors at the lowest attainable cost.&#13;
A good production department can save the publisher a great deal&#13;
of money, and also help to expedite the final stages of the&#13;
publishing process.&#13;
3)  Limited Initial Printing.   Unfortunately, in book production&#13;
mistakes are permanent and are there for all to see once the book&#13;
has been printed. It is always advisable, therefore, to keep&#13;
first print runs low, and to give authors, editors and teachers&#13;
a chance to review the final product, and to correct errors of&#13;
omission and of commission before the second, larger printing is&#13;
scheduled.&#13;
5. Testing and Piloting materials Prior to Publication. Most textbook&#13;
authors develop their ideas and preliminary materials while teaching, and&#13;
continuously test these materials on their own pupils, or in the classrooms&#13;
of colleagues. This is an on-going process and constitutes Stage 1 of testing.&#13;
Little or nothing should be included in a textbook that has not been tried and&#13;
tested in this fashion.&#13;
Nevertheless, there remains a need at all stages of school publishing for&#13;
testing the concepts and content that are being developed. Such testing begins&#13;
by critically reviewing the original outline of a project. It continues through&#13;
repeated reviews of manuscript submitted by cualified persons unconnected with&#13;
the authors, which are repeated through all stages of editorial development and&#13;
design. With new projects and, especially,with government-soonsored books,&#13;
it is advisable to pilot preliminary editions in selected classrooms for a full&#13;
year, rev-se the materials on the basis of carefully collected feedback from&#13;
these trials, and then proceed with the preparation of final editions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
Summary. During the process of developing widely used school texts,&#13;
leading private sector publishers normally spend a great deal of time&#13;
reviewing, editing, rewriting, testing, and editing again all of the content&#13;
materials that go into their textbooks. This is accomplished, of course, in&#13;
cooperation with the authors. While the development of educational materials&#13;
on this basis takes several years and is expensive, the end result should be&#13;
effective textbooks. If they fail in their efforts to pr-oduce an effective&#13;
textbook series, authors and publishers risk their professional reputation,&#13;
waste years of work and considerable money. Hence, testing the materials&#13;
during each stage of development becomes extremely important.&#13;
A government-sponsored publisher must be especially careful in exercising&#13;
his responsibility for piloting and testing all classroom materials prior to&#13;
publication because he is in a position to impose his textbooks on all schools.&#13;
We will return to this topic when discussing the situation in the LDCs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

V. Development of Institutionalized Publishing in LDCs&#13;
A. A Look at the Past and Present&#13;
In previous sections, we discussed at some length various aspects of&#13;
book publishing, and saw that developed countries worked toward establishing&#13;
a publishing industry and continue to support its growth in many ways.&#13;
Certain countries, especially those belonging to major language groups, such&#13;
as, English or Spanish, traditionally depended during their development&#13;
period on the publications of a "mother" country; other nations need to look&#13;
for their models elsewhere. However, sooner or later every sovereign nation&#13;
needs its own vigorous and creative publishing industry. It needs to give&#13;
official recognition and support to the unique role of the book in nation-&#13;
building, cultural development, education, growth of a national literature,&#13;
self-improvement and information.&#13;
The post-World War II world has seen a great improvement in general&#13;
educational standards. With it came an unprecedented growth of book publishing,&#13;
as well as the development of new media for education, information and&#13;
entertainment.&#13;
In much of the world, the flow of books and of ideas in education has&#13;
crossed international boundaries, protected by widely accepted copyright laws,&#13;
and the UNESCO Free Flow Agreement (Florence Convention).     Governments,&#13;
especially those of LDCs, are spending increasing amounts of money on their&#13;
educational systems. Many nations subsidize certain activities, including&#13;
the export, of their publishing industries. "Trade follows the Book," coined&#13;
by Sir Stanley Unwin, has been a widely accepted slogan.&#13;
Most industrialized nations have developed programs to support the book&#13;
by campaigns designed to make their people more book-conscious and by massive&#13;
purchases of learning materials with public funds. Many of these nations have&#13;
attempted in various ways to make their books more readily accessable to&#13;
countries which cannot afford to cav their full price.&#13;
Commercial publishers,with the support of their authors, created ingenious&#13;
schemes to cope with book hunger in The Third World through the publication&#13;
of inexpensive reprint editions, and by granting, often for token fees,&#13;
translation rights in so-called non-commercial languages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
The Soviet Union and, to an extent, China have subsidized export of&#13;
translations, often in English or Spanish, of their textbooks and national&#13;
literature.&#13;
Many of these activitiesare helpful, and few actuall. harm the less&#13;
developed countries. Some national aid programs provided, at least temporarily,&#13;
needed books to students at tertiary levels at prices they could afford to pay.&#13;
In other instances, translations into local languages were actively sponsored.&#13;
Nevertheless, in few if any cases did these activities result in the establish-&#13;
ment of strong national publishing industries, nor did they manage to bridge&#13;
the "Book Gap." Today, the hunger for books may be greater than ever before&#13;
and,with it, the need to institutionalize book publishing in the LDCs. Yet,&#13;
most developed nations, the United States a discouraging example, have actually&#13;
abandoned book support programs or greatly reduced their efforts in this&#13;
direction.&#13;
It is fair to ask what went wrong with these well meaning efforts,&#13;
especially if the intention is to improve the record.&#13;
Observing the record in both developed and developing countries, it soon&#13;
becomes clear that a publishing industry cannot be created, nor can it survive&#13;
for long without a major commitment by government to nurture and protect this&#13;
industry. Such a commitment requires a long-range policy of substantial&#13;
investments in education and educational materials, most importantly, perhaps,&#13;
appropriate and constant public funding for the provision of basic school&#13;
textbooks, the development of school and national libraries, for research,&#13;
and,more generally,for promoting literacy and the reading habit.    Without&#13;
determined, long-range support by the national government, even well planned&#13;
and financed book assistance programs offer only temporary relief at best.&#13;
Secondly, most often,book assistance programs are restricted in time and&#13;
effort to short-term or one-shot programs. They lack the necessary continuity&#13;
and institution-building required to create publishing expertise and permanent&#13;
publishing institutions.&#13;
These observations appear to be exceedingly basic and obvious. Yet, it&#13;
is curious to note that many publishers in the industrialized world are them-&#13;
selves only dimly aware that their very existence depends on the expenditures,&#13;
the direct and indirect support, of their governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
In a later section, we will discuss "The Role of Government" in detail.&#13;
At this point, we may remember that in major industrialized countries with&#13;
private sector publishing industries as much as 40% of book sales may be&#13;
purchased by public institutions, such as, schools. In addition,.many countries&#13;
provide   subsidized postal rates for educational materials.&#13;
As a next step, it may be instructive to look briefly at the record&#13;
of three major book programs,two developed for the benefit of the Philippines&#13;
and one for Indonesia.&#13;
B. Summaries of Three Major Book Programs&#13;
1. The Philippines: United States Textbook Production Project (TPP),&#13;
1961-1966.    This project is probably the largest textbook project ever&#13;
undertaken by USAID. It was planned to provide for approximately 80% of&#13;
the basic need for public elementary and high schools. USAID provided&#13;
text and cover materials, some technical assistance, notably printing ex-&#13;
pertise and supervision, including the use of the USIA regional printing&#13;
plant in Manila, as well as training for local government employed authors&#13;
by USAID textbook and instructional materials specialists. The Philippine&#13;
government provided the preparation and selection of the textbooks, con-&#13;
tracts with private or public publishers and printers, and contracts for&#13;
the distribution of the books.&#13;
The overall US dollar contribution was set at $4.4 million; the Philip-&#13;
pine contribution was set at 65 million pesos ($16.75 million), inclu-&#13;
ding counterpart funds generated by US agricultural aid. Table 2 details&#13;
the planned output of the project which produced nearly 25 million books.&#13;
Approximately half of the titles produced were specifically written&#13;
for the project; 35 to 40 titles were reprints. Most of the books were&#13;
extensively illustrated in four colors, printed bv offset, casebound with&#13;
cloth covers - all meant to last a minimum of five years.&#13;
65% of the books were produced by the private Philizpine printing in-&#13;
dustry, so that the project had a major impact on. upgrading and providing&#13;
work for that industry.&#13;
By the end of 1966 and the conclusion of the project, the Philippine&#13;
government was facing an acute economic crisis and the Department of Edu-&#13;
cation ran out of funds for needed revisions, reprintings and replacement&#13;
of the books.&#13;

By printing and binding standards, the TPP project produced books that&#13;
could well be compared to those in the industrialized nations. It is clear&#13;
that the project was managed by printers, and good ones. However, it is not&#13;
clear whether manuscripts were ever tested and piloted in classrooms before&#13;
mass production, or whether teacher training was part of the project. To&#13;
the best of our knowledge, no one ever investigated how effective these books&#13;
were in classroom use. By an incredibly narrow interpretation of the TPP&#13;
enabling legislation, financial support for producing teachers' guide to&#13;
accompany the textbooks was ruled out "because guides are not textbooks."&#13;
In 1975, when the results of TPP were briefly investigated in the con-&#13;
text of appraising a new textbook project for The World Bank, we were unable&#13;
to locate a single complete set of these texts, any of the expensively&#13;
produced films, or determine whether any titles had ever been reprinted,&#13;
revised or supplemented. By 1975, Philippine classrooms once again lacked&#13;
textbooks to a paralyzing extent.&#13;
2.  Indonesia:  IDA Third Education Project.    In 1972, a third educa-&#13;
tion project in Indonesia was appraised and an IDA Credit of U.S. $13.5 mil-&#13;
lion was approved for this project in early 1973. In addition to the Credit,&#13;
the project was financed by an interest free loan of up to C$13.0 million&#13;
From the Government of Canada for the purchase of printing paper. The project&#13;
was designed to improve the quality of primary education by: the development&#13;
Df existing arrangements for textbook preparation and testing; printing and&#13;
distributing 138 million textbooks; and in-service training of 350,000 primary&#13;
school teachers and 2,800 supervisory personnel.&#13;
In hindsight, the project would have been better had it broadened its&#13;
Eocus from printing and distributing books (a first priority in 1973) to a&#13;
:oncern for institution-building, the development of professional publishing&#13;
:apabilities, training and retention of adequate staff. Since development of&#13;
?ublishing institution and expertise was made an obeective of the project,&#13;
,here has been little manuscript development, and the project experienced&#13;
3roblems with the testing, production and distribution of books. At present,&#13;
loubts remain whether the produced materials can be effectively used in&#13;
:lassrooms throughout the country.&#13;
LDescriptions based on a) Appraisal, A Third Education Project, Indonesia,&#13;
May 4, 1973, and b) Report of the Pre-Investment Study on Textbook&#13;
Development and Other Book Projects in Indonesia, November 1978.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
In spite of such reservations, this project was successful in produc-&#13;
ing and distributing more than 154 million books, textbooks and 7 million&#13;
teachers' guides by September 1979, making it one of the largest textbook&#13;
projects ever undertaken. Unfortunately, delays of up to two years in&#13;
production schedules caused by slow financial and publishing procedures&#13;
(and no doubt unrealistic schedules) have meant considerable dislocation&#13;
in the concurrent training program for teachers. Nor were books delivered&#13;
to schools on time for the beginning of academic years. An ambitious pro-&#13;
gram for trying out manuscripts in randomly selected schools proved impos-&#13;
sible to compile in a meaningful fashion and had little impact on manu-&#13;
script revisions. As in the Philippine project previously cited,&#13;
considerably more time and effort was spent on physically producing books&#13;
and on the severe problems of distribution, than on assuring that these&#13;
books were relevant to classroom needs and would be properly utilized.&#13;
Since it was not an objective of the original project design, the project&#13;
accomplished little in creating publishing know-how and was of no assis-&#13;
tance in building a publishing industry. Because of poor quality control,&#13;
this project did nothing to improve the quality of book printing in&#13;
Indonesia.&#13;
The Indonesia Working Committee preparing the Pre-Investment Study on&#13;
Textbook Development cited earlier, spent considerable time describing the&#13;
achievements as well as the problems and failures of this project in some&#13;
detail.  It summed up its "Findings in Brief" as follows:&#13;
The Working Committee found that textbooks, guides and library&#13;
books were reaching students and teachers in numbers unprece-&#13;
dented before the two five-year Development Plans. Parents in&#13;
the cities, towns, and rural areas were relieved of much of the&#13;
financial burden of sending children to school.&#13;
Yet it is apparent that many weaknesses in the present book&#13;
projects can be put down to the lack of a fully staffed organi-&#13;
zation established for the specific purpose of publishing books.&#13;
Full-time expertise, concentrated on a wide range of publishing&#13;
tasks, could improve the quality of the books. The projects&#13;
require major promotional support among teachers, parents, and&#13;
the public. There has so far been little coordination between&#13;
projects (i.e., different book projects) or between Government&#13;
and the private sector. There is no quality control of printers'&#13;
performance. The most cost-effective methods of designing books,&#13;
printing large numbers of copies and purchasing textbook paper&#13;
are not necessarily used by the individual projects. The&#13;
Government projects have not sufficiently encouraged the partici-&#13;
pation of private publishers in their view, even though 83% of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
the work of printing, distribution, and related activities goes&#13;
to the private sector. A diversity of books is not so far en-&#13;
couraged. Individual projects do not generate enough feedback&#13;
for the curriculum units of the Ministry of Education and Culture.&#13;
3. The Philippines: Third Education Project - Effective Date 7/29/76.&#13;
As originally proposed this was intended as a crash program to print approx-&#13;
imately 150,000,000 books badly needed for the support of public school&#13;
education in the Philippines, at a planned estimated cost of $120,000,000.&#13;
Almost all of the funds were earmarked for the purchase of paper, printing,&#13;
and binding, and for a teacher training program to retrain all teachers in&#13;
the use of the new books.&#13;
Books to be produced were described as on the average of 350 pages,&#13;
7-1/2 x 10" trim size, printed in one color on locally produced newsprint&#13;
paper, with sidewire binding and tagboard covers.   Little, if any thought&#13;
had been given in the original Project Proposals (dated February, 1975) to&#13;
building a publishing institution, to the fact that textbook publishing&#13;
should be a continuous process or to assuring the development of a profes-&#13;
sional group of authors and publishing specialists. As with the Indonesian&#13;
Project, it was assumed that books be printed by local presses, and that&#13;
this would satisfy demands by the local publishing industry to be included&#13;
in the proposed project.&#13;
In this instance, during appraisal the Government and the Bank agreed&#13;
that institution-building should be a prime goal of the project, and the&#13;
project design as financed placed emphasis on the method of preparing and&#13;
testing manuscripts, the selection of suitable paper, and the quality produc-&#13;
tion of books. It was agreed that Bank support would be in two phases; dur-&#13;
ing the first phase, of four years duration, 27 million textbooks and&#13;
teachers' editions would be produced and distributed, and related teacher&#13;
training would be provided.&#13;
A Supervision Summary, dated 12/13/78, summed up the project as of that&#13;
date as follows:&#13;
In the thirty months since loan signature, the project unit has&#13;
made significant progress in implementing the textbook develop-&#13;
ment program. Project staff now total 111, including 65 profes-&#13;
sional (i.e., publishing specialists) and 8 administrative&#13;
employees. The Editorial and Production divisions have completed&#13;
31 final edition titles (out of 71 to be completed by June, 1981).&#13;
The Manufacturing and Distribution divisions have printed 17 titles&#13;
for a total of 9.5 million copies (out of 27 million by 1981) of&#13;
which 8.2 million have been distributed to schools. There have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
been delays in manuscript preparation and book deliveries, but&#13;
for 1979 it is planned to have textbooks of the 1978/1979 pub-&#13;
lishing programs delivered in time for school openings. A re-&#13;
search study of the Program Evaluation Section has compared&#13;
the achievements of the project textbook users and non-textbook&#13;
users for the school years 1976-1977 and 1977-1978 for grades 1&#13;
and 2, in science, mathematics and Pilipino. Compared to non-&#13;
textbook users, pupils who use textbooks scored significantly&#13;
higher on the average in the three subjects tested. Progress&#13;
continues toward producing more effective and visually attrac-&#13;
tive books. Establishing the Textbook Project as a permanent in-&#13;
stitution with the necessary autonomy remains a problem which&#13;
affects morale 'of management and staff. Upon its' resolution may&#13;
hinge the eventhal success or failure of the project.&#13;
This is an encouraging record, of which the improved appearance of the new&#13;
Philippine textbooks may be the most significant part. As is so often the&#13;
case, the early books published by the project were brought out under great&#13;
pressure to produce, before the organization had a chance to get established&#13;
let alone settle down to its task. Thus, revisions of these first titles&#13;
will soon be required. In addition, in the preparation of future publica-&#13;
tions the editors need to consider more fully the wide range of learning&#13;
requirements represented by a school population spread out over numerous&#13;
islands and of many differing language backgrounds. Provided the organiza-&#13;
tion continues to mature and the staff is allowed to feel secure in their&#13;
positions, all of this can be accomplished.   As long as the Philippine&#13;
Government remains firm in its support of the book program and establishes&#13;
a clear policy towards participation of the private sector, the country will&#13;
have a growing and increasingly competent publishing industry.&#13;
C. The Role of Government&#13;
Obviously, when discussing less developed countries, we,are dealing&#13;
with a great variety of conditions, and of stages of development, from&#13;
Somalia to Mexico, the latter, in many respects, moving rapidly beyond LDC&#13;
status. Within this range it is almost impossible to generalize, and yet&#13;
it is hardly feasible in the space of a short paper to treat ea'ch LDC&#13;
separately. As a result, we recommend that specific comments and observa-&#13;
tions which follow are carefully and knowledgeably interpreted whenever&#13;
they are to be applied.&#13;
We might also mention that we consider this section on Government's&#13;
Role so important that a special "Questionnaire" (Appendix 1) was pre-&#13;
pared and sent to more than a dozen experienced publishing profession-&#13;
als. Their detailed responses have been of immeasurable help in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
clarifying, reinforcing and often adding to our views. Commercial, as well&#13;
as non-commercial publishers, took part in this informal survey, as well&#13;
as goverrnment officials, scholars, experts who have consu'lted on book&#13;
p.rograms,including the nationals of eight countries from Latin America,&#13;
North America, Europe and Asia. In no case are we taking positions in&#13;
this paper that did not obtain some solid support from this group.&#13;
With this as background, the next sections of this paper attempt to&#13;
relate major issues of the growth of publishing industries to government&#13;
attitudes and support. For example, we seek to define for LDCs possible&#13;
roles of public and private sector publishing activities in the creation of&#13;
a viable industry. Obviously, private sector activities do not exist in&#13;
the Socialist countries, where the state owns and operates all means of&#13;
production, however, a variety of publishing institutions may perform&#13;
similar tasks. In a general way, we are focusing in this paper on pragmatic&#13;
solutions, which, when pronerly analyzed and adopted to a specific country,&#13;
will have a chance of success, rather than expounding the merits of competing&#13;
economic and political systems.&#13;
1. Development of a Publishing Industry and Government Support. As is&#13;
readily appreciated, most publishing industries serve a great variety of needs&#13;
represented by their extraordinary range of products from romances to erudite&#13;
monographs. They sell their products to a wide range of customers from&#13;
individuals, bookstores, wholesale distributors, to educational and allied&#13;
institutions supported by public funds. Publishers serving such a large&#13;
community need government facilities, such as, an effective postal system,&#13;
preferably with subsidized postal rates for educational materials to make it&#13;
feasible for them to ship their publications to many of their customers. Since&#13;
books are heavy in relation to their value, subsidized mails often are the only&#13;
way to supply what are typically small, individual orders. As one lawmaker&#13;
supporting a subsidy for educational materials stated: "we cannot justify the&#13;
same rates for shipping a brick and a book." M4ail subsidy for educational&#13;
materials presently runs close to $1 billion in the United States.&#13;
In sianificant ways, the economic growth and health of a publishing industry&#13;
is dependent on the continuous and consistent expenditure of public funds for&#13;
schoolbooks, and on librarv development for the public,for schools,and research&#13;
institutes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
When expenditures for school materials and libraries are generous and&#13;
remain constant, the effect on the publishing industry is immediate in&#13;
stimulating new sales, the publication of new titles, and other improvements&#13;
in quantities and qualities of books available to the public. This happens&#13;
to be true in India, where much of the publishing industry depends on the&#13;
regular allocation of grants to libraries, in the USA where the federal&#13;
government drastically increased its aid to non-federal libraries in the&#13;
1960's, in the Soviet Union where much of the publishers' output is bought&#13;
by libraries, or anywhere else. It is easy to imagine what happens in reverse&#13;
when local, state, and federal governmentsreduce funds available for the&#13;
purchase of books. Indeed, this has lately happened in several countries with&#13;
shrinking enrollments and budgets for public schools, and with library budgets&#13;
which have not increased sufficiently to maintain collections in the face of&#13;
rising prices.&#13;
A mature publishing industry, supported by a vast reading public, and&#13;
-economically strong can survive moderate fluctuations in government support&#13;
by concentrating on the more consistent sales to the general public. But it&#13;
must be obvious that a newly established publishing industry, in a young&#13;
country, without widespread literacy or ingrained book buying habits must be&#13;
carefully nurtured and must depend upon the regular expenditure of public funds.&#13;
It is often argued that LDC governments do not have the necessary funds to&#13;
finance and provide loan/free educational materials to their school populations,&#13;
yet, most pupils and their parents in such countries do not have the wherewithal&#13;
to purchase such books on their own either. To quote one of our respondents&#13;
from Mexico: "We have to consider that if a government says that elementary&#13;
education becomes an obligation for every citizen, then government should&#13;
provide the facilities for such education. The facilities are schools and&#13;
materials, professors and places to study."&#13;
LDC governments, to their credit, make great efforts and sacrifices in&#13;
support of the monumental task of educating their people. If books and other&#13;
educational materials have been slighted in the process, it is often a lack&#13;
of recognition of the value of textbooks and of libraries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
A variety of supportive activities    is aiding the growth of the publishing&#13;
industries of certain countries. National Book Trusts, National Book Awards,&#13;
book weeks, library weeks, grants and special promotions through exhibits have&#13;
all been used with varying success.&#13;
As examples of farsighted action and constructive concern, we have chosen&#13;
two very dissimilar countries which provide examples for furthering the growth&#13;
of their very different indigenous publishing industries:&#13;
a.  Mexico:  Some twenty years ago the government decided to provide every&#13;
child in the primary grades (1-6) with sets of basal textbooks in major&#13;
subject areas free of charge. The books are not loaned, but given to the&#13;
children. It is the only case of a developing country, we are aware of, which&#13;
has taken what many would consider a drastic step and, yet, has developed a&#13;
thriving publishing industry. Mexico's methods and especially the constraints&#13;
the government exercised in limiting its entry into publishing are,therefore, of&#13;
great interest.   From the outset, the Mexican government decided, wisely&#13;
we believe, to limit its publishing to the first six primary grades, which&#13;
provide the basis of education for a majority of its people. Furthermore,&#13;
the government provides only basic materials, leaving schools free to supplement&#13;
government textbooks with those published by the private sector. The result is&#13;
ably summed up by a Mexican publisher in response to the questionnaire:&#13;
From my point of view, we car, consider that in Mexico such a policy&#13;
has worked because it has provided free textbooks for every school&#13;
without any discrimination.&#13;
As publishers we might say that this has drastically reduced our&#13;
market at this level for private industry. However, if we compare&#13;
the Mexican elementary (school level) publishing industry with Latin&#13;
American countries that do not have free texts we can say that our&#13;
industry, even with free texts, is stronger than most. This indicates&#13;
that our schools are still using supplementary materials.&#13;
We also should consider the benefits that the free texts are providing.&#13;
First, we should bear in mind that if everyone has a certain quantity&#13;
of books for education, an appreciaticn for books grows in the student.&#13;
At the same time, if this (scheme) is making more and more students&#13;
go through elementary education, we can see enrollments at secondary,&#13;
preparatory and university level growing more and mcre. And, therefore,&#13;
for the private industry the benefit is in the upper levels . . . and&#13;
more people will be able to read books in general.&#13;
we provide a few more details on the Mexican experience in Appendix 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Mexican government created a market for its publ_shing industry by re-&#13;
lieving parents of the worry of having to buy basic school books, and yet&#13;
by allowing schools who could affor-' it to purchase supplementary books.&#13;
Mexico has also actively supported the development of libraries.&#13;
The Mexican government exempts publishing profits from income tax, it&#13;
provides subsidized prices for certain locally produced papers, and allows&#13;
the duty free import of book paper as needed. Book exports are supported&#13;
by various incentives. A vigorous publishers' association prods and works&#13;
with government for the benefit of the industry.&#13;
b. Canada: A large, highly developed country with a small population,&#13;
Canada is part of the English -and - French-speaking worlds. Its book in-&#13;
dustry has long been dominated by England, France and the United States.&#13;
In 1977, the domestic Canadian book market was estimated at $600 million&#13;
in net sales by publishers, rather than sales to end consumers. English&#13;
books accounted for $510 million, French for the remaining $90 million.&#13;
$432 million worth of these books were imports. Canadian book production&#13;
accounted for $168 million of domestic sales plus an estimated $57 million&#13;
of exports, or a total of $225 million. Again, a majority of-sales is&#13;
supported by public funds.&#13;
Through a program of special grants and subsidies, Canada lately&#13;
has begun to support indigenous publishing. While it is difficult to&#13;
summarize the various benefits Canadian publishers receive without analy-&#13;
zing a great deal of data, direct grants, and government guaranteed&#13;
loans for one are presently available. In one successful experiment, the&#13;
Ontario governmnent's "Halfback Program," losing tickets of the state-run&#13;
lottery are redeemable at half value on the purchase of Canadian books&#13;
and on magazine subscriptions. The Canada Council, in two decades of&#13;
federal assistance has supported Canadian artistic expression, espe-&#13;
cially in the literary field. Export development has been supported by&#13;
providing `unds for Canadian participation at international book fairs.&#13;
Other and far reaching proposals for the protection and development of&#13;
Canadian publishing have recently been made. Thev include a proposal&#13;
for a Canadian Cultural Industries Development Agency to support the&#13;
private sector and special tax treatments for publishers and bock sellers.&#13;
Procosals to the Canadian Publishing Industry by David 'MacDonaid, MP,&#13;

2. How to Define the Proper Role of LDC Governments in Textbook Publishing.&#13;
This has been the central question of the "Questionnaire" mentioned earlier.&#13;
Its successful resolution would contribute more than any other single issue&#13;
toward the growth of publishing industries in the LDCs, and the concomitant&#13;
growth of available educational materials and a national literature.&#13;
a. Should government have a permanent or temporary role in textbook&#13;
publishing? Few would argue against a permanent role in curriculum development&#13;
as a basisfor textbooks, and in setting minimum standards for approval of books&#13;
to be used in the public school system. Most would argue against making such&#13;
curricula too specific, where they would tend to inhibit creative interpretation&#13;
by qualified authors, but for as much flexibility as possible. On the question&#13;
of textbook approval, qualified committees are suggested who would be required&#13;
by statute to approve every text that covers the minimum program. Requirements&#13;
for approval should not be so tightly drawn that each book must follow the same&#13;
sequence in teaching. Such a choice should be a prerogative of the creative&#13;
author/educator and publisher. Nor should unduly restrictive requirements as&#13;
to format and size (number of pages) be part of the approval process.&#13;
b. Should government itself create an institution for publishing textbooks&#13;
for free/loan distribution or subsidized sale? Opinions differ widely on this&#13;
issue as to whether government should actually take over the role of textbook&#13;
publishing, as in Mexico.&#13;
Responses to this question divide,to some extent, the believers in free&#13;
enterprise from those who favor government action. However, the question goes&#13;
deeper and, therefore, troubles even those who are proponents of government&#13;
action in other areas. Government dominance of schoolbook publishing can become&#13;
a potent political tool, with implications that range from creating revolutionary&#13;
change in society at one extreme, to perpetuating the status quo at the other.&#13;
Moreover, "publishing," as should have become apparent, is a form of "manufacture,"&#13;
even outside the narrow interpretation of that term as printing. A book is a&#13;
tailor-made product "manufactured" by a team of authors, editors, designers and&#13;
illustrators for a specific purpose. In many instances, prevalent government&#13;
structures and budget procedures make it well-nigh impossible to operate a&#13;
"manufacturing" process professionally and efficiently.&#13;
Perhaps, Mexico is a good example of what can be accomplished given a&#13;
certain stage of development. Yet, few countries need go as far as Mexico&#13;
and incorporate an elaborate and expensive printing plant in their textbook&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
project. Any government which decides to become a national textbook publisher&#13;
must be prepared to face many problems and to make a long-term commitment.&#13;
It should be ready to set up an autonomous agency, with an independent budget&#13;
which allows for long-range planning, and with pay scales competitive with the&#13;
private sector. Admittedly, these are difficult things to accept for most&#13;
governments. Plans for a government textbook agency should be carefully and&#13;
expertly conceived. It is recommended that publishing activities are limited&#13;
to basal textbooks for basic education, so that private sector publishing is&#13;
allowed to develop and to participate at all levels of educational publishing.&#13;
A national publishing institution needs a long-term mandate, butits mode of&#13;
operation should be reviewed after the first 10-to-15 years. A mechanism for&#13;
phasing out projects no longer in the public interest might well be part of&#13;
the original charter.&#13;
c. Could government develop manuscripts to be "published" by the private&#13;
sector on an open bid basis? We have "published" in quotation marks,in this&#13;
instance, because to us manuscript development is of the very essence of&#13;
publishing. It may be argued, however, that private publishers in many of&#13;
the LDCs are weakest in the material development area, and that governments&#13;
may have more competent human resources for writing textbooks within the public&#13;
education system. Development of manuscriptscould take the place of establishing&#13;
a fullfledged government publishing apparatus. But such a procedure may be&#13;
fraught with political implications, with conflict of interest, and may even&#13;
lead to corrupt practices. As an essential prerequisite, "government authors"&#13;
would have to be trained in how to organize and execute such a program.&#13;
Participating publishers should be prequalified in an effort to screen out&#13;
those who are mainly opportunistic. Only such organizations as are actually&#13;
engaged in publishing on their own, and are capable of providing the authors&#13;
with necessary editorial, production and distribution services should be able&#13;
to participatein bidding for government-authored manuscripts.&#13;
If the aim of such a joint-venture between government and the private&#13;
sector is to publish basal textbooks for the elementary grades, government&#13;
would almost certainly have to guarantee a sufficient market for these books&#13;
because of the investment involved in producing a reasonably good series.&#13;
At other levels of publishing, for the secondary schools, for instance,&#13;
government approval or endorsement of the textbook may be sufficient to&#13;
guarantee a viable market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59.-&#13;
Textbook materials developed by an agency of government, or by officials,&#13;
while on the public payroll should, perhaps, have limited copyright protection.&#13;
Thus, copyright may be vested in government, assigned to a cooperating private&#13;
publisher for a period of ten years, and then become part of the public domain.,&#13;
In this way, publications originally developed with government funds could&#13;
become prototypes for private sector publishers to imitate and imorove upon.&#13;
d. Should a government publisher establish its own printing plant?&#13;
Could a government-sponsored textbook organization encourage further develop-&#13;
ment of the private sector publishing and orinting industries? Opinion is&#13;
practically unanimous against a government publisher oporating its own&#13;
printing plant,the Mexican experience to the contrary. Government-run&#13;
printing plants are notoriously inefficient. Besides, because of the cyclical&#13;
nature of publishing, it is difficult to run any such plant efficiently. Unless,&#13;
there is absolutely no alternative, as the country is so underdeveloped that&#13;
printing plants of sufficient capacity do not exist and cannot be stimulated&#13;
into being by the prospect of textbook orders, it is far better to work on&#13;
improving the local printing industry. In some cases, printing abroad is&#13;
preferable to saddling government with the considerable investment and&#13;
responsibility for a plant. As an added word of caution, most governments&#13;
do own government printers for the purpose of producing special government&#13;
forms, records, transcripts, etc.   However, such plants are not suitable for&#13;
book production, and should not be asked to expand in that direction.&#13;
e. Should government and private sector publishing compete? The general&#13;
reaction to this question is: "Who are you. kidding, how can a small publisher&#13;
in an LDC compete with the power of government, against subsidized or free&#13;
textbooks in an economy where all resources are scarce."   We, therefore,&#13;
recommended earlier that for efficiency, and to give the private sector an&#13;
opportunity, government clearly restrict its publishing activities.&#13;
At a later stage of development, and at times in surprising places,&#13;
private sector publishers do ccmpete on the basis of auality (as in countries&#13;
where government supplied books are of minimal quality). They may offer&#13;
useful suDplementary materials or even take advantage of the inefficiency in&#13;
production and distributicn so often associated with government projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
f. How can government support the growth of a private publishing&#13;
industry, thereby, taking steps to narrow the "Book Gap"?&#13;
1) By assuring publishers of a growing market for their books.&#13;
Governments need to support efforts at literacy and recognize that the&#13;
supply of textbooks and other educational materials for basic education&#13;
deserves priority in government budgets, equal to paying teachers and&#13;
building schools. Library development significantly enhances literacy&#13;
and education at all levels. It must be supported not only by training&#13;
librarians but by regular purchase of books.&#13;
2) Government needs to foster and support a distribution system&#13;
for books. Consideration must be given to subsidized postal rates, and&#13;
the development of retail outlets for books. The establishment of bookstores&#13;
should be supported, if necessary, in imaginative and novel ways. A newly&#13;
literate population may have difficulty in "approaching" the book. Government&#13;
could help by bringing the book to the people, make libraries more open and&#13;
less forbidding to the average citizen, open book corners where books may be&#13;
easily purchased, treat books as consumable, i.e., a useless resource as long&#13;
as the books are sitting on the shelves.&#13;
3) Within its laws and regulations, government may well recognize&#13;
that publishing and the book trade are small items as they affect the overall&#13;
economy, drain scare resources, or effect gross national product. Thev are&#13;
nevertheless critical items in terms of human and national development. LDC&#13;
governments could adopt various preferential treatments often extended to&#13;
publishing industries and the book trade in other countries, some of which&#13;
have been referred to in this paper. Because of the small size and special&#13;
place of book industries, this might be done without fear of opening. the&#13;
floodgates of demands from other industries.&#13;
4)  The protection of copyright,or the disregard of it, has become&#13;
an emotion charged issue, if not a political football. Yet, no publishing&#13;
industry can be expected to flourish without appropriate copyright protection.&#13;
We feel constrained to point out some inevitable facts:&#13;
a. Forms of literary piracy have been practiced by almost every&#13;
countrv during certain stages of its development.&#13;
b. No country has managed to develop an indigenous publishing industry&#13;
without extending copyright protection to its authors and, at the&#13;
same time, respecting the literary properties of other nations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
Even state publishing agencies usually insist on strong copyright&#13;
protection to guard against illegal reprints of government&#13;
sanctioned books, which are then sold for profit. The trend,&#13;
indeed, has been toward more clearly defining the rights of&#13;
author/publishers, and toward greater efforts to assure that&#13;
they are well protected.&#13;
c. There are those who persistently, and often with the best of motives,&#13;
espouse the abolishment or infraction of copyright, and who have&#13;
little compunction in recommending the purchase of the pirated&#13;
editions.  Yet, these people are generally unaware of the economic&#13;
relationship between publishing bestsellers and, at the same time,&#13;
other equally desirable but less profitable titles. Pirates reprint&#13;
only those titles for which an assured market has already been created&#13;
by the original author and publisher. Legitimate authors and publishers&#13;
count on their bestsellers to support that large part of their works&#13;
which will not contribute a profit or even repay expenses. Without&#13;
copyright protection, they will be driven out of business by&#13;
opportunistic entrepreneurs, with a resulting drying up of new&#13;
publications.&#13;
3. Prerequisites for Success. Very simply stated, the role of the book,&#13;
the complexities of book publishing, and the long-term nature of the process&#13;
must be given due recognition. The specific situation and requirements of each&#13;
LDC must be carefully assessed and taken into account before planning can begin.&#13;
We can no longer assert that in the.unique instance of industrializing textbook&#13;
publishing each countrv must reinvent the wheel. The new nations should not&#13;
be encouraged to disregard the experiences of other nations, the techniques&#13;
and practices which have served others well. Expertise and experience are&#13;
required for the analysis of actual requirements in the textbook sector.&#13;
Proven techniques exist for developing effective textbooks, which may be&#13;
applied regardless of the specific content and necessarv adaptations to&#13;
specific conditions.&#13;
On a visit to the Peoples' Republic of China, we met an acquaintance who&#13;
had been shown a film depicting the ten-year struggle of an agricultural commune&#13;
to solve its irrigation problem.   His informed ccmment on the exoerience struck&#13;
home: "If they had called in a trained civil engineer in the first place,"&#13;
he said, "they might have saved themselves ten years of t-ial and error."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
Time is running short, and precious resources have been wasted on trial&#13;
and error attempts to solve the book hunger. Governments and development&#13;
agencies need to take a more professional approach and be prepared for a&#13;
continuing responsibilitv in this area of development. a &lt;' should not&#13;
hesitate to call upon a "trained engineer," but should use the experience&#13;
of developed book industries and their technicians. Even with such assistance,&#13;
novel and changing requirements of education in the LDCs will require the&#13;
courage to temporize, to experiment, to find new answers, to revise and&#13;
supplement. In such instances, experience and proven techniques will be&#13;
of great help but, in addition, equally necessary will be empathy and&#13;
sensitivity, a knowledge of the country and its circumstances, an ability&#13;
to work with local expertise.&#13;
The industrialized nations and their publishing industries must perceive&#13;
more clearly that self-interest alone dictates that they should cooperate in&#13;
the development of publishing in the LDCs, that they would be well advised&#13;
to share their knowledge and expertise, be prepared to offer cooperation and&#13;
training facilities.&#13;
Governments of both developed and developing nations, to a much greater&#13;
extent, must include book learning and book production in their economic and&#13;
educational development plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

VI. Publishing for the LDCs&#13;
A. Suggestions for a Blueprint&#13;
By now we take for granted a basic understanding of the realities&#13;
of publishing and of textbooks. We are aware that whereas the former,&#13;
establishing and nurturing a publishing industry, isan on-going process,&#13;
the life of a textbook is finite. Schoolbooks are to be used and con-&#13;
sumed, whether they are made to last one year or five. Schoolbooks are&#13;
most effective when they are tailor-made for a specific task. When that&#13;
task changes it is far better and cheaper to change the book than to&#13;
attempt getting by with reprinting outdated editions.&#13;
Simply making books "available " often does not solve the prob-&#13;
lem, as countless literacy programs have shown.&#13;
In the early 1950's, U Nu, founder of modern Burma, created the&#13;
Burma Translation Society. The high-minded task of the Society was to&#13;
translate all that is best in world literature from Plato to Shakespeare,&#13;
to Faulkner and Dewey. By making these books available in inexpensive&#13;
editions to the Burmese people, it was hoped to raise the standard of&#13;
literacy almost instantly. Perhaps Burma's approach sounds naive, but&#13;
we have met and argued with. countless scholars, imported and native-&#13;
grown, who attempt to do exactly the same thing with textbooks in the&#13;
LDCs. These educators recommend, develop and write primary/secondary&#13;
school textbooks of an academic level of content and difficulty&#13;
which. bears no relation to the realities of the affected classrooms.&#13;
Their expectations are that these texts alone, regardless of the pre-&#13;
paration and background of classroom teachers and pupils, will almost&#13;
instantaneously raise standards of education by quantum jumps.&#13;
By refreshing contrast, Dr. Albarracin, Deputy Minister&#13;
of Education of the Philippines, pointed out in an interview&#13;
that textbooks for his country should be biased towards the poor&#13;
barrio schools and take into account that presently 60% of their students&#13;
leave school between the 4th and 6th grades. The soundness of this&#13;
advice should be self-evident. Children in metropolitan Manila, for&#13;
example, have far more opportunity to supplement their education as&#13;
they attend better equipped and taught schools than their brethren in&#13;
the villages. Yet, most officially approved schoolbocks cater toward&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
improving the standards of what is already an elite.&#13;
The Blueprint for a textbook project, must be based on numerous&#13;
considerations, including those cited in the following pages. Infor-&#13;
mation obtained must be interpreted without undue bias, discounting&#13;
what might be described as wishful thinking, or the result of normal&#13;
antagonism between bureaucrats and the private sector.&#13;
1. Beginning with a realistic assessment of the level of com-&#13;
petency of classroom teaching, evaluate the background of students,&#13;
special language and literacy problems, and average school leaving&#13;
ages; analyse the prescribed curriculum for textbooks on this basis.&#13;
The curriculum may have to be modified or even disregarded, of course,&#13;
with the sanction of proper authorities, which may be easier where&#13;
basal manuscripts are prepared under government auspices. In such cases,&#13;
the newly approved textbooks may constitute a de facto government ap-&#13;
proved change in curriculum.&#13;
2. Enrollment figures should be projected over several years.&#13;
Regional variations in language, religion, and culture should be&#13;
studied and the major goals of government, its bias towards work-oriented,&#13;
academic or vocational education be considered.&#13;
3. All projections should be made five years and ten years ahead,&#13;
as it will take a m-nimum of five years before the first books of any&#13;
truly new scheme will be received by students.&#13;
4. Textbooks presently in use should be studied and evaluated.&#13;
working teachers should be interviewed as to their needs. Teacher sup-&#13;
port is crucial with the introduction of any new textbook scheme.&#13;
5. Concerned government and outside agencies should be sensitized&#13;
to the recuirements and realities   of a major effort at creating a pub-&#13;
lishing industry, and/or textbook project. Their degree of support,&#13;
of flexibility ard long term commitment will in the end decide the suc-&#13;
cess or failure of any project.&#13;
6. The existence and degree of sophistication of a local publishing&#13;
industry, of local printers, and paper manufacturers need to be investi-&#13;
gated.&#13;
7. It is critical to investigate the means of distribution that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
are available for books and how a major textbook project might fit such&#13;
an existing system. Government sponsored book projects as a rule have&#13;
considerably greater difficulties delivering their products to the final&#13;
consumer than the private sector. The answer to this particular riddle&#13;
is simple: Private publishers do not get paid unless their books reach&#13;
consumers. Such incentives do not exist for the distribution by govern-&#13;
ment of loan/free books. On the contrary, government publishing pro-&#13;
jects often attempt to use official channels which are neither set up,&#13;
motivated, or even adequately financed to handle quantities of textbooks.&#13;
8. Dimensions of real needs and priorities must be balanced&#13;
against what is attainable, considering the short term and long term&#13;
resources available from government and outside agencies.&#13;
9. All of this input will have to be reduced to numbers, titles,&#13;
books, staff requirements, and all the costs connected with develop-&#13;
ment, manufacture, distribution, introduction/promotion, and teacher&#13;
retraining.&#13;
10. Where reliable information is hard to come by, and pressure&#13;
to act somewhat precipitiously becomes irresistable, we strongly recom-&#13;
mend pilot projects of small scale, limited to readily monitored areas.&#13;
Innovative publishing of preliminary editions may satisfy the need for&#13;
action in these instances, and pave the way as well towards large&#13;
scale publishing later on.&#13;
11. No educational publishing project should be approved or under-&#13;
taken unless one of its main components is institution-building.    In-&#13;
stitution-building should not be attempted without competent advice,&#13;
whether locally available, or "imported."&#13;
12.  In every instance of textbook development, a whole range&#13;
of existing models of successful series or titles should be carefully&#13;
studied.  That this is not normally done in the LDCs bv their authors,&#13;
publishers, and authorities, is mostly a matter of ignorance. It&#13;
is certainly the standard practice in all the industrialized nations.&#13;
We all learn from previous experience, and not only by what may be&#13;
available in our own country. In additicn, savinas in time and in&#13;
money which mav be realized if an existing book or series can be&#13;
adapted and/or translated are of major significance. Resulting savings&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
can amount to millions of dollars and several years otherwise spent in&#13;
writing, testing, and editorial development. Exchange of educational&#13;
materials, their translations and adaptations, are routinely carried out&#13;
among established publishing industries. It should become e5ztablished&#13;
practice for the young publishers of LDCs. Yet, in this area, expertise&#13;
and competent research are also needed if such translations/adaptations are&#13;
to result in effective teaching aids.&#13;
B. Suggestions for the Execution of a Project&#13;
In a country with little or no prior experience of educational publish-&#13;
ing, how does one begin? Emphatically, not by commissioning people to&#13;
write texts, by purchasing paper, and by ordering the printing of books!&#13;
The first order of business, one that initially may take a year or&#13;
more, is to develop and establish an institution, to select, appoint, and&#13;
where necessary train staff, to introduce organization and objectives, to&#13;
clarify functions and relationships.&#13;
As soon as the organization settles in, it should be able to help with&#13;
the preparation of the Blueprint. It will assist with the selection and&#13;
briefing of authors, prepare evaluations of submitted materials, survey and&#13;
pre-qualify sources of paper, printing and binding, and tackle the thorny&#13;
problems of distribution. Last, but not least, it will study means by which&#13;
the new textbooks may be thoroughly tested before publication and later on&#13;
introduced and promoted to teachers and the public.&#13;
In other pages of this paper, we have provided the reader with a glimpse&#13;
of the complexities of the process. Textbook writing and organizational&#13;
development require time and a competent and highly motivated staff. Without&#13;
once again describing the entire process covered earlier, we might highlight&#13;
here special features related to publishing for LDCs, and certain important&#13;
differencesbetween orivate sector and government-sponsored publishing.&#13;
1. In Search of Authors. How one selects authors goes to the heart of&#13;
the publishing process; it is one of the most important functions of an editor.&#13;
In school publishir.g, it is rarely possible to lure exzerienced and successful,&#13;
authors away from their present publishers.   Besides, the competitive clause&#13;
in oublishing contracts prevents authors from writing similar texts at&#13;
identical levels for several houses. Therefore, each publishing house tends&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
to groom its own author teams. These teams become progressively more&#13;
experienced through revisions and new editions of their work. Requirements&#13;
for authors were spelled out earlier in this paper. We would generally&#13;
look for experienced classroom teachers, committed to change and improvement,&#13;
who with backing and motivation would be willing to dedicate their time to&#13;
textbook writing. It is not alwavs possible to predict how potential authors&#13;
will respond to the ardours of writing, nor how they will interact with their&#13;
teammates until the actual writing process is well underway. Therefore,&#13;
arrangements with authors must provide for changing the make-up of a team&#13;
without jeopardizing the entire project.&#13;
2. Evaluation and Testing of Materials. Commercial publishers in the&#13;
established industries, as a rule, do little formal pre-testing or evaluation&#13;
of materials before publication; where necessary, they may publish preliminary&#13;
editions of textbooks for actual classroom testing prior to full-scale produc-&#13;
tion. Instead of formal pre-testing, these publishers tend to rely on the&#13;
proven competence and experience of their authors, editors, and designers,&#13;
since few new elementary or secondary textbook series are a radical departure&#13;
from what was previously published and successfully used in the classroom.&#13;
However, after publishing a new book or series, all publishers rely on their&#13;
field forces and editors to gather extensive feedback from those schools&#13;
where their textbooks are in actual classroom use. It has often been said&#13;
that a successful textbook series, by definition, is one which has been&#13;
repeatedly revised and refined on the basis of such feedback.&#13;
In LDC textbook projects, the testing and evaluation process must of&#13;
necessity be quite different. In the developing nations few, if any,&#13;
experienced authors and publishers are available and-, therefore, few models&#13;
of successful teaching materials. Under such circumstances, extensive&#13;
pre-testing becomes mandatory for any materials which are to be widely used&#13;
at primary and secondary levels,   even though such requirements may raise&#13;
serious problems for the private publisher who may need at least some&#13;
government support to comply.&#13;
A government which plans to provide loan/free basal textbocks for its public&#13;
school system, whether it intends to produce the materials itself or in&#13;
cooperaticn with commercial publishers, most certainly should insist on&#13;
extensive and responsible pre-testing, and on the necessary time for revising&#13;
materials in light of test results.&#13;
I See previous comments, "Testing and Piloting Materials Prior to Publication,"&#13;
Page 43&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
Classroom testing to be effective should be professionally organized&#13;
and supervised. It should be carried out over an entire school year, and&#13;
within a manageable number of schools, representativeof the variations in&#13;
the system.&#13;
It must be closely supervised by teachers and consultants well prepared&#13;
for the task. Preliminary editions should be tested only in a final and&#13;
complete version.&#13;
Test results should not be expected to reduce the offered materials&#13;
to manageable portions, to alter the basic approach or methodology of the&#13;
authors, or to affect the basic objectives and content of the work.&#13;
Instead, the results of classroom testing might improve the presentation&#13;
and teachability of the materials if standard questionnaires are carefully&#13;
prepared and concentrate on items such as follows:&#13;
Organization/Layout&#13;
Style&#13;
Readability&#13;
Content - Skill Development&#13;
Evaluation - Tests&#13;
Teachers' Editions - Management in the Classroom&#13;
Need for Supplementary Materials.&#13;
3. Editorial. Enough has been said aboutthe editorial function and&#13;
the role of the editor to illustrate his importance. By background and&#13;
predilection, the textbook editor is akin to his authors. In addition to&#13;
teaching experience, subject knowledge and writing ability, he brings to his&#13;
calling a sense of structure and design, a trained instinct for wnat is&#13;
possible, what teachers and pupils in the average classroom are likely to accept.&#13;
4. Production and Manufacture. In their own right, production managers&#13;
and purchasers of paper, printing and binding have equally critical roles to&#13;
play.  Their technical ability, integrity, and resourcefulness assure the&#13;
best product that a given amount of money can buy.&#13;
5. Distribution. As much as in any other area of the publishing process,&#13;
the distribution of books demands a high degree of initiative and incentive.&#13;
With the current Philippine   Textbook Project, it was observed that two oroducts&#13;
apparently reached every corner of the Philippine archipelago:    San Miguel beer,&#13;
and comic books, the latter on a regular weekly schedule and often by air&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
since their readership and, therefore, sale depended on continuity.&#13;
Distribution needs motivation, and much more organization and innovation&#13;
than it is commonly given. On a large textbook project, hundreds of titles&#13;
and millions of copies call for computerized inventory control, mechanized&#13;
order and billing facilities, and an efficient warehousing operation.&#13;
Primary reliance on government facilities for the distribution of quantities&#13;
of bulky, easily damaged books is generally ineffective.&#13;
The publisher, public or private, must assume the responsibility and the&#13;
authority to assure that his products reach the end consumer, be it school or&#13;
bookstore. Where necessary, existing bookstores, wholesale distributors, and&#13;
freight forwarders may be made use of. The establishment of regional Textbook&#13;
Depositories is another option. No half-way measures, such as, depending on&#13;
the willingness of the Ministry of Education to carry the load, are normally&#13;
effective, and with most government-sponsored projects, textbooks do not reach&#13;
schools on a regular and predictable schedule.&#13;
6. Introduction of Niew Textbooks to Teachers and Schools- Teacher Training.&#13;
With countless LDC book projects, people exert themselves to produce the books,&#13;
labor to get them to schools for loan/free use, and then find to their astonish-&#13;
ment and disappointment that teachers carefully lock up the received bounty and&#13;
adamantly refuse to use it.&#13;
The reasons for such surprising resistance may be varied, some as basic&#13;
as gover.nment regulations which make individual teachers personally responsible&#13;
for damage or loss of books. In most cases, however, such books remain on the&#13;
shelves because teachers have been ill-prepared for their arrival. They may&#13;
feel auite justly that their needs have not been taken into consideration in&#13;
the preparation of these books. In most cases, teachers are not keptinformed&#13;
of the aims of a textbook project, are not properly instructed in the use of&#13;
the books they are to receive, or are given woefully inadequate teachers'&#13;
edit-ons.&#13;
Mass distribution of new textbooks generally constitutes a drastic change&#13;
in the traditional teaching methcds practiced in most LDCs. Such a change may&#13;
appear threatening to the teacher; therefore, the acceptance of new teaching&#13;
materials and their constructive use require careful advance preparation,&#13;
promotion and publicity, and, perhaps, even the involvement of parents and&#13;
the general oublic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
In addition, a well structure program of teacher training should&#13;
accompany the introduction of new schoolbooks. As has been pointed&#13;
out elsewhere in this paper, educational publishers often provide pre-&#13;
adoption seminars, as well as post-adoption "trouble shooting" workshops&#13;
when a school district purchases new textbooks. With large-scale schemes&#13;
introducing new textbooks to teachers who may have had little experience&#13;
in teaching from a textbook, one would have to go considerably further.&#13;
The situation of these LDC teachars is more akin to what went on in the&#13;
schools of the industrialized nations during the 1950's and 1960's. At that&#13;
time, radically new methods for teaching, for example, modern mathematics&#13;
and science, were introduced into the school systems. It became then necessary&#13;
to launch massive programs for retraining teachers. Often, these programs&#13;
consisted of 3-6 week summer courses, sponsored by government-funded agencies,&#13;
which teachers attended during vacation period.&#13;
It has been pointed out in this paper that well prepared textbooks,&#13;
together with well conceived teachers' editions, not only aid students in&#13;
their studies, but may, in fact, constitute a form of in-service training&#13;
for teachers. However, for this to happen, working teachers must be prepared&#13;
for their new task through extensive in-service training. Teacher training&#13;
colleges and universities should include in their curricula analysis and&#13;
demonstration of the use of textbooks and of teachers' editions, which&#13;
government may be supplying to schools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-71 -&#13;
VII. A Final Word&#13;
Books are fundamental to education and all children deserve the very&#13;
best. The importance of adequate schoolbook supplies toward raising&#13;
academic standards has been insufficiently recognized in past efforts;&#13;
provision of textbooks, other teaching materials, and library supplies&#13;
has had low priority with budget planners; existing models of effective&#13;
textbooks and professional publishing expertise have been generally&#13;
disregarded, often out of ignorance rather than by design. It is time for&#13;
a change.&#13;

APPENDIX I&#13;
Publishing: Respective Roles of&#13;
Private and Public Sectors in&#13;
Less Developed Countries&#13;
I am addressing these brief notes and questionnaire to my distinguished&#13;
and knowledgeable friends in the sincere hope that you will be kind enough&#13;
to help me.&#13;
Since this is such an important topic, I would ask, knowing fully well&#13;
how busy you are, that you share some of your thoughts and experiences with&#13;
me, point me to additional sources of-information, where convenient, and&#13;
make me aware of any literature or research which exists.&#13;
As some of you know, I have become involved again with the development&#13;
of educational publishing in the Third World.    Since 1975, I have been&#13;
working on several projects financed by the World Bank, in Indonesia and&#13;
The Philippines, as an occasional consultant. However, other areas in Africa,&#13;
Asia, Latin America and the Arab World face like problems.&#13;
I have been asked to develop guidelines, to define and advise on roles&#13;
and relationships between public sector and private sector publishing,&#13;
especially as they relate to textbooks at elementary and secondary level. I&#13;
hesitate to put forward my own feelings until I have checked the experiences&#13;
and feelings of colleagues and friends I respect. I need your help.&#13;
In an effort to simplify a complex issue steeped in controversy and&#13;
apparently dominated by extreme views on both sides, you may or may not wish&#13;
to accept these postulates:&#13;
1. A sovereign nation needs a vigorous and creative publishing industry.&#13;
It must give official recogniticn and support to the unique role the book plays&#13;
in nation building, cultural development, growth of a national literature,&#13;
education, self-improvement, and information.&#13;
2. Every government, from the socialist countries to that of the USA. has&#13;
a legitimate concern in education and is engaged in publishing activities.&#13;
Therefore, it is not a question of whether a government should publish at all,&#13;
but rather to what degree it should participate, and how it should define the&#13;
respective roles and responsibilities of the public and private sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
3. Educational publishing is a sine qua non for creating the book habit&#13;
and supporting a publishing industry, especially in its early stages, yet&#13;
without trade publishing the book habit cannot be sustained, nor is an&#13;
individual or nation able to mature. Only a diversified publishing industry&#13;
can provide the range of materials essential to modern society.&#13;
4. Third World countries are under great pressures to upgrade and make&#13;
more relevant their educational systems. In many instances, governments&#13;
have inherited educational traditions which are oral, or at least not markedly&#13;
textbook oriented. Classroom teachers do not necessarily feel the need for&#13;
elaborate textbook materials, may in fact be threatened by them. They do not&#13;
have experience with using or even less producing effective, modern materials.&#13;
Therefore, expertize in the development and publishingof learning materials&#13;
in many instances needs to be created, often with help from the outside,&#13;
before any effective publishing, public or private, can take place.&#13;
5. After about two decades of controversy and search for the technological&#13;
breakthrough, it has become evident and acknowledged by persons involved in&#13;
"development" that the textbook, teacher manual, workbook are the most basic,&#13;
effective and cost-effective teaching tools available for upgrading academic&#13;
achievement. This is not to say that television, visuals, audio materials do&#13;
not have a rightful place in teaching.&#13;
If one broadly accepts the foregoing, how can developing nations best&#13;
develop, produce, and distribute on a cost-effective basis the vast quantitites&#13;
of text materials their schools require? How should they go about developing&#13;
the strong, competitive publishing industries which in the long run are their&#13;
only assurance for providing not only textbooks but the entire range of&#13;
educational,cultural, and informational materials nation building requires.&#13;
Please let me have your thoughts. The attached questionnaire is meant to&#13;
provide some reference points. It lists essay type questions that seem to be&#13;
asked most often.   I would be grateful if vou will fill it in, providing as much&#13;
additional information as vou would like. This is not an "official" inquiry,&#13;
rather I am soliciting your personal advice and opinion as one professional to&#13;
another.&#13;
Many thanks in advance,&#13;

4.  Would you please briefly define your views on what guidelines LDCs should&#13;
follow if they wish rapidly to develop and to produce the basic educational&#13;
materials needed for upgrading their educational systems, at low cost, in&#13;
the face of often small, inexperienced, undercapitalized book industries,&#13;
while at the same time supporting the growth of a publishing industry for&#13;
the future.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            Major conclusions and suggestions are:
            (a) textbooks, teacher editions, and allied materials are
            the most consistent factors in upgrading academic
            achievement, especially for poorer schools with less
            qualified teachers; (b) textbooks, etc. are cost effective
            tools which greatly enhance the efficiency of an educational
            system; (c) the development, production, and distribution of
            textbook materials should not be carried out in isolation
            and without professional competence; (d) rather institution
            building, teacher training, long-range government
            commitment, a total look at the book industry of a
            developing country are prerequisites for success; (e) the
            area of educational publishing lends itself well to Bank
            financing, which can provide impetus, technical assistance,
            and smooth out the intially high developmental costs. It
            fits in well with Bank concerns regarding equity of access
            to education, and building the human resources needed for
            economic development.
