1. OVERVIEW&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1   Eritrea is located in the northeastern part of Africa. The overall size of the&#13;
country is about 125,000 square km, with a coast line of 1,000 km, and a population&#13;
estimated in the range of 3.0 and 3.5 million, including nearly half a million refugees in&#13;
Sudan. Eritrea is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a GDP per capita in the&#13;
range of US$ 160 to US$ 190 (less than half of the average per capita income of sub-&#13;
Saharan countries). While there are no firm estimates of the incidence of poverty, it is&#13;
believed that about two thirds of the population is poor (more than 50% calculating the&#13;
impact of food aid). The country's social indicators are consistent with its low per capita&#13;
income. Life expectancy at birth is estimated to be low at about 46 years, compared to 50&#13;
years for Sub-Saharan Africa. Infant mortality is 135 per thousand live births, the under-&#13;
five child mortality rate is 203 per thousand live births, and maternal mortality is over&#13;
700 per one hundred thousand live births. Also in the education sector the indicators are&#13;
lower than in most African countries. The illiteracy rate stands at 80% for men and 90%&#13;
for women, and the gross enrollment rate at the primary level is among the lowest in&#13;
Africa (47% in 1994).&#13;
1.2    Historically, Eritrea was a nation of skilled people with a wealth of experience in&#13;
entrepreneurship, commerce, and international trade. At the time of its liberation, in&#13;
1991, Eritrea inherited a devastated economy: enterprises were not operational; the&#13;
agricultural sector was severely damaged by the war; major infrastructure was damaged&#13;
or destroyed; and basic social service facilities had suffered from war damage or serious&#13;
neglect. The disruption of family life due to war, displacement and drought, has left&#13;
thousands of children as destitutes and orphans. It is estimated that there are nearly&#13;
100,000 internally displaced people, and some 50,000 ex-fighters have been demobilized&#13;
for reintegration into civilian life.&#13;
1.3   Enormous pressures have been placed on Eritrea's forest and land resources. It&#13;
has been estimated that around one hundred years ago, as much as 30 percent of the&#13;
country may have been under closed forests and woodland types. Currently, agricultural&#13;
land clearance continues to place the heaviest pressures on forested areas, and this has&#13;
been exacerbated by customary notions of land and resource tenure which limited the&#13;
incentive to cultivate and manage trees. Though no recent inventories have been carried&#13;
out, the FAO estimated, in 1994 that total forest and woodland cover accounts for around&#13;
12 percent of the land area.&#13;
1.4    With liberation, Eritrea is returning to its traditions of resourcefulness, shared&#13;
endeavor, and entrepreneurship. Despite its shattered economy, the country has rapidly&#13;
re-established the main functions of government, and embarked on an impressive process&#13;
of reconstruction. The country has many strengths which support this process: a strong&#13;
sense of nationhood strengthened through the liberation struggle, and a well-organized&#13;
and active community structure; strong ownership of national development programs;&#13;
and a flexible approach to economic development. Both the reconstruction efforts and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
the more recent development strategies and programs demonstrate a blend of orientations:&#13;
building solutions that respond to and take advantage of the special characteristics of the&#13;
country; clear public leadership imbued with a strong commitment to social justice;&#13;
openness to and encouragement of private sector initiative, both domestic and foreign;&#13;
utilization of the talents and resources of Eritrea's well educated and successful diaspora;&#13;
and outreach to visions, methods, and technologies beyond the African context. The&#13;
sections below summarize the most significant results achieved in the four years after&#13;
liberation.&#13;
B. RECENT ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE&#13;
1.5   Since liberation, Eritrea has laid policy foundations for a liberal market economy&#13;
operating alongside a unitary governmental structure that reaches down to and represents&#13;
the interests of the lowest community levels. In a relatively short period the country has&#13;
made significant progress in restructuring key institutions, establishing governmental&#13;
functions in all key sectors, and eliminating a number of restrictive policies inherited&#13;
from the past. In May 1991, the Government of Eritrea launched a Recovery and&#13;
Rehabilitation Program, aimed at jump-starting the economy. However the economy&#13;
improved strongly in 1994 and it is estimated to have grown by 14.1 percent in real&#13;
terms. Industrial production, as well as service sector activities have continued to expand&#13;
due to an increase in exports, a growing private small-scale sector, the partial&#13;
rehabilitation of a few larger enterprises, a strong resurgence of construction activities,&#13;
and recent good harvests.&#13;
1.6   Policy Reforms. The Government has introduced a number of important policy&#13;
reforms aimed at stimulating investment and economic growth, and reducing&#13;
protectionism and controls. Trade policies have been revised and simplified import&#13;
licensing procedures introduced. Export taxes have been eliminated. A new Investment&#13;
Law has been prepared to replace the 1991 Investment Code, opening all sectors to&#13;
private investments. The former Labor Code, which prohibited hiring of labor by the&#13;
private sector is being revised and private hiring of labor being permitted. Centralized&#13;
marketing and planning systems have been disbanded so that most public and private&#13;
enterprises are free of price and marketing restrictions. A land proclamation has been&#13;
issued, providing every farmer with life-time usufruct rights, giving women equal access&#13;
to land, making provision for usufructs to remain within the family on the death of the&#13;
land-holder; permitting rental and mortgaging of land-use rights; permitting the sale of&#13;
capital improvements; and reconfirming the right to enter into share-cropping&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
1.7   Institutional Strengthening Under a comprehensive public sector strengthening&#13;
program, the Government has implemented a large number of measures to rationalize&#13;
institutions and has completed the process of streamlining of the civil service, comprising&#13;
about 15,000 employees. Efforts are also being made to address the shortage of skilled&#13;
staff in key positions, and the mandate of the University of Asmara has been focused to&#13;
support the effort to build local capacity in key technical and managerial areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
C. RECENT SOCIAL PERFORMANCE&#13;
1.8   Health Status. For the large majority of Eritreans, available health status&#13;
indicators suggest low life expectancy and high infant, child and maternal mortality.&#13;
Besides the high average levels of these rates, there is substantial variation among the&#13;
regions. The main health problems are primarily ones which are amenable to PHC&#13;
interventions. According to a recently conducted Burden of Diseases study (BOD, 1994),&#13;
the top five diseases in terms of discounted years lost are perinatal/maternal; diarrhea;&#13;
acute respiratory infections; tuberculosis; and malaria, accounting for over 62 percent of&#13;
the BOD in Eritrea. While this pattern of disease has lead to low life expectancy to date,&#13;
it also means that with steady increase in PHC service coverage this burden of disease&#13;
can be transformed rather quickly. Finally, since food supplies depend on good rains and&#13;
related harvests, the nutritional status of the population can exacerbate much of the key&#13;
health problems, including the BOD.&#13;
1.9   The State of Health Care Delivery. Since independence the Government has&#13;
been expanding the provision of PHC with the objective of reducing deaths from easily&#13;
controllable diseases and enhancing awareness of good health practices to improve the&#13;
productivity of the work force. The health expenditures as a percent of total Government&#13;
expenditures show a consistent incremental trend after independence, with a consequent&#13;
improvement in the extension of primary health services. The MOH estimates 46 percent&#13;
of the population have access to basic health services. Though this estimate is based on&#13;
approximate information, nevertheless it is undoubtful that the share of population with&#13;
access to PHC services is constantly increasing. Data gathered during a recent Initial&#13;
Health Sector Review (1995), show a significant increase in the number of children from&#13;
0-5 years of age whose weight and height were monitored at health facilities from 1993 to&#13;
1994. The share increased from about 6.9% in 1993, to over 22.4% in 1994. The same&#13;
review also recorded nearly a doubling of the share of pregnant women having at least&#13;
one ante-natal visit from 1993 (14.5%) to 1994 (28.2%). The share of births delivered at&#13;
a health facility increased from about 2.7% (1993) to 9% (1994). From 1991 to 1994 a&#13;
total of 181 health facilities at various level have been constructed or rehabilitated,&#13;
facilitating the provision of PHC in the rural and most remote areas of the country.&#13;
Regarding the immunization coverage, information for 1993 and 1994 is not available in&#13;
comparable form at this time to compare improvements that are undoubtedly occurring,&#13;
but there is evidence that the number of facilities providing imnmunization have increased&#13;
and the solar power storage refrigerators for vaccine have been installed in many facilities&#13;
during 1994. Finally, increase has been registered in the use of contraceptive (from 1.7%&#13;
in 1993 to 2.3% of women between the age of 15 and 45 years in 1994), even if the&#13;
contraceptive prevalence is still very low in the country.&#13;
1.10  Education Status. Since 1991, the Government policy had the main objective of&#13;
increasing access, improving the quality, and guaranteeing equity in the distribution of&#13;
primary education services. The budget for the education sector increased almost&#13;
threefold and the results have been impressive. When compared to the 1992/93 academic&#13;
year enrollment in pre-school, primary, middle and secondary education increased by&#13;
almost 10, 12, 15 and 4% respectively (reaching 47.4% in 1993/94 at the primary level;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
22.4% at the junior secondary level; and 13.7% at the senior secondary level). In more&#13;
than 25 centers literacy programs were provided to 4,000 adults, while the evening&#13;
programs enrolled more than 12,500 adults. The government identified two major&#13;
constraints in primary education: lack of infrastructure, and shortage of teachers.&#13;
Between 1992 and 1994, 80 primary schools were constructed and 52 rehabilitated,&#13;
mostly with direct involvement of local communities. In 1990/91 there were 4,500&#13;
teachers in Eritrea. About half of these were Ethiopians, and following liberation they&#13;
went back to their homeland, which resulted in severe teacher shortages. In 1993/94 the&#13;
number had risen to 7,265. As a result of this intensive training campaign, the average&#13;
pupil teacher ratios fell between 1991/92 and 1993/94 from 41 to 39 at the primary level;&#13;
37 to 34 at the lower secondary level; and 38 to 32 at the senior secondary level.&#13;
2. POLICY FRAMEWORK AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
A. DEVELOPMENT AND SECTOR STRATEGIES FOR ERITREA&#13;
2.1   Eritrea's Development Strategy. The national development objective is to&#13;
create a modem, technologically advanced and internationally competitive economy in&#13;
the context of a free, democratic and decentralized political system, where private&#13;
enterprise is the driving economic force. To achieve these objectives the Government has&#13;
adopted a broad-based growth strategy that has aspects of rehabilitation, reconstruction&#13;
and development covering all sectors of the economy. Major components of this strategy&#13;
are human capital formation, with education and health as key inputs, export-oriented&#13;
development both in industry and agriculture, infrastructural development to remove&#13;
critical bottlenecks, environmental restoration and protection, and the promotion of the&#13;
private sector.&#13;
2.2   The center-piece of this strategy is the establishment of an efficient, outward&#13;
looking private sector-led market economy, with the Government playing a proactive role&#13;
to stimulate private economic activities. The economic role of the public sector would&#13;
normally be restricted to those areas which the private sector may tend to avoid because&#13;
of the externalities.&#13;
2.3   Sector Policies and Development Programs. In the context of the overall&#13;
development policy framework, sectoral strategies and programs have been prepared.&#13;
They provide the basis for public and/or private sector programs and activities to address&#13;
the various social problems of the country and to realize its development potential.&#13;
2.4   Basic Education. The Government is developing a national policy for the&#13;
education sector, which builds upon and develops the initiatives taken by the EPLF&#13;
during the period of the struggle. The policy aims to: (i) promote basic education in a&#13;
way that takes into account the specific characteristics and conditions of each region; (ii)&#13;
establish a seven-year basic education system; (iii) promote the use of local languages as&#13;
a medium of instruction at the primary level; (iv) progressively eradicate illiteracy; (v)&#13;
develop curricula for secondary education responsive to the needs and opportunities of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
S&#13;
labor market; (vi) promote the use of English as a medium of instruction at the secondary&#13;
level; (vii) promote and improve the quality of technical and vocational education and&#13;
training; (viii) encourage and promote female education; (ix) provide special education&#13;
services for the disabled; (x) guarantee a balanced mix of centralized and decentralized&#13;
education management structures; (xi) facilitate the opening of private schools at all&#13;
levels; and (xii) encourage communities to play a stronger role in the management of&#13;
education services.&#13;
2.5    The Ministry of Education (MOE) has drafted a five year development plan for&#13;
the education sector. The strategies focus on improvement of the quality of the education&#13;
services through development of new and more updated curricula; improved access to&#13;
educational services through the construction of new schools especially at the basic level;&#13;
recruitment and training of new teachers; retraining of teachers already in-service; a&#13;
policy of cost-recovery through the direct involvement of communities and parents in the&#13;
provision, management, and financing of the education services; and, the reduction of&#13;
gender imbalances through the implementation of intensive campaigns to promote girls'&#13;
education. Other cornerstones of the MOE strategy are the emphasis on adult literacy and&#13;
post-literacy programs, particularly for women; the development of a variety of&#13;
approaches to technical and vocational training; improved incentives for teachers and&#13;
education personnel, in the framework of a wider restructuring of the civil service; and,&#13;
capacity building for all levels of the education sector.&#13;
2.6   The most urgent short-term priorities focus on basic education, non-formal&#13;
education, and technical and vocational training. This will involve the construction or&#13;
rehabilitation of 350 equipped elementary schools in the next five years, in order to&#13;
provide each village or territory (an area serving nomadic or scattered population) with a&#13;
school, with particular attention given to the previously neglected areas of the country. In&#13;
addition this will require the training or retraining of a sufficient number of teachers to&#13;
operate the newly constructed or rehabilitated facilities; the implementation of a&#13;
nationwide awareness campaign to improve girls' attendance and performance in basic&#13;
education; the improvement of teacher training; and, the preparation of new curricula&#13;
based on the history. traditions, and socio-economic situation of the country, sensitive to&#13;
regional, ethnic, and linguistic differences.&#13;
2.7    Basic Health. Since independence, the Government has been developing and&#13;
implementing a health sector policy designed to: (i) reduce the burden of disease; and (ii)&#13;
educate the public to engage in good health practice leading to improved productivity.&#13;
The strategies to achieve these objectives are: (i) making available to the public basic&#13;
health services, and especially primary health care (PHC); (ii) containing and controlling&#13;
the spread of major health hazards; (iii) enabling the private sector to participate in the&#13;
delivery of health services within the regulatory framework of the Ministry of Health&#13;
(MOH); (iv) promoting community and beneficiary participation in financing health care;&#13;
(v) introducing National Health Insurance; and (vi) promoting the dissemination of&#13;
information about good health practices.&#13;
2.8    MOH's draft Basic Health Strategic Implementation plan is currently being&#13;
reviewed by the Government. The key priority is the strengthening of primary health care&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
services, in line with the broad national goals of equity, service accessibility,&#13;
affordability, community involvement (especially in financing), intersectoral&#13;
collaboration, and decentralization of management. Emphasis will be given to the&#13;
sustainability of health systems at all levels. To strengthen the quality and accessibility of&#13;
primary health care, improvements in the development, organization, and management of&#13;
health care infrastructure are vital. In addition, the plan aims to create an enabling&#13;
environment to ensure an adequate supply of essential resources: human, financial and&#13;
materials, such as drugs and equipment. Finally, the strategy promotes intersectoral&#13;
collaboration, vital for primary health care goals, especially regarding nutrition,&#13;
environmental sanitation, and clean water.&#13;
2.9   Rural Water Supply. Improved access to water for social and economic&#13;
development is one of the top priorities of the Government. Access to safe drinking water&#13;
supply in rural areas is a particular concern. Rural water supply coverage is estimated at&#13;
7%; and 48% of the population rely on hand dug wells which are often unsafe and&#13;
unreliable (71% of all hand dug wells are less than 5 meters in depth).&#13;
2.10  As an input to the Government's Macroeconomic Policy, the Water Resources&#13;
Department (WRD) within the Ministry of Energy, Mines, and Water Resources has&#13;
drafted a policy that states the Government's intention to: (i) reduce its current role in the&#13;
"provision" of water and focus on, or "promote" water resources management; (ii)&#13;
encourage private sector participation in the sector, including privatizing drilling and&#13;
other implementation functions; (iii) treat water as an economic good, requiring users to&#13;
pay for what they consume; (iv) conserve water and reduce pollution; (v) take a balanced&#13;
approach to the distribution of water among social and economic sectors; (vi) ensure the&#13;
active participation of the population, particularly women, in water works; and (vii)&#13;
facilitate the equitable distribution of water in all sectors.&#13;
2.11  The Government is planning a Rural Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation&#13;
Program (ERIWESP) in consultation with key sector agencies, which will review&#13;
Government policies, strategies, and plans; evaluate current programs and projects; carry&#13;
out a water resources assessment; and develop a comprehensive framework for the sector.&#13;
Key issues to be addressed include: community participation, gender, standardization,&#13;
sustainability, health and hygiene education and coordination. The outputs from the&#13;
formulation phase will help shape Government policy for the sector and lay the&#13;
foundations for sector development.&#13;
2.12  In addition to the above, the Government is currently reviewing several policy&#13;
decisions concerning community participation in sector development, and intends to hold&#13;
a National Meeting on Operation and Maintenance of Water Supply and Sanitation to&#13;
discuss and confirm these recommendations. It is intended that communities bear the full&#13;
recurrent costs (operation and maintaining) of their schemes. In addition it is proposed&#13;
that they establish user charges that allow them to meet the replacement cost of pumping&#13;
technology. In the long term they are expected to be responsible for the full replacement&#13;
costs of their schemes. These criteria (recurrent and replacement costs) will help to guide&#13;
the selection of technology that is appropriate both in terms of per capita costs and&#13;
sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
2.13  Soil, Water and Forestry Conservation. The Government accords a high&#13;
priority to the preservation of the environment, as long-term growth depends on the&#13;
sustainable use of the country's natural resources and assets. Based on an extensive&#13;
process of consultation with community organizations and all major ministries, the&#13;
Government recently produced a National Environmental Management Plan for Eritrea&#13;
(NEMP-E), which was officially adopted in 1995. In accordance with a recommendation&#13;
of the NEMP-E, work on drafting of an environmental law has begun in May 1995, and is&#13;
expected to be completed in a few months. The Eritrean Agency for the Environment&#13;
(EAE) has been established as an interim secretariat within the Ministry of Local&#13;
Government, but with a large degree of autonomy.&#13;
2.14  The main objective of the NEMP-E is to provide a framework for coordinating the&#13;
protection and enhancement of Eritrea's natural resource base. It identifies a wide range&#13;
of actions for improvements in environmental health, management of human settlements,&#13;
the sustainable development and preservation of the coastal and marine environment,&#13;
containment of industrial pollution, improved water management, curtailment of land&#13;
degradation and deforestation, and the preservation of bio-diversity. The NEMP-E&#13;
highlights two important themes underlying the government's overall approach to&#13;
environmental management. The first is that the environment should be treated not as a&#13;
separate issue, but as an integral component of all sectors. Consequently NEMP-E's main&#13;
emphasis is on building up the skills and awareness of staff in the line ministries, and on&#13;
the capacity of ministries to oversee the implementation of environmental assessments for&#13;
projects within their areas of responsibility. A second theme underlying the NEMP-E, is&#13;
the importance of community participation in all aspect of environmental management.&#13;
Many of the suggested measures are based on collaborative efforts by communities and&#13;
government, and on a continuing dialogue that respects the traditional knowledge of&#13;
communities and raises public awareness of the implications of various forms of human&#13;
activities on the environment.&#13;
2.15  Another important instrument of the environmental policy is the land policy,&#13;
included in the Government's Macro-Policy document. It states that the objectives of the&#13;
new land policy are to establish a revised tenure system that: (i) encourages long-term&#13;
investments in agriculture and prudent environmental management; (ii) assures women's&#13;
rights to land on equal basis with men; and, (iii) promotes commercial agriculture.&#13;
2.16  Presently, conservation programs are carried out with an emphasis on structural&#13;
measures: terracing, bunding, contour ditches, and check dams have all been used to&#13;
reduce run-off, enhance water infiltration, and retain soil particles. In physical terms, the&#13;
achievements have been impressive, but maintenance remains dependent on additional&#13;
injections of food or cash for work. Afforestation is another major component of the&#13;
conservation efforts. While millions of seedlings have been planted under communal&#13;
responsibility, much of the plantations have died because of lack of maintenance. To the&#13;
extent that soil and nutrients are retained on cropland through conservation measures,&#13;
there will be a relative improvement in productivity, which however must be weighted&#13;
against the loss of agricultural land, taken up by the structure. The net result is not&#13;
always positive. In terms of hydrogeological benefits, catchment conservation will&#13;
probably produce mixed results. Because Eritrea has low rainfall and high evapo-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
transpiration, terracing may substantially reduce the run-off available for conservation in&#13;
reservoirs. On the other hand, it is believed to increase infiltration into the groundwater&#13;
aquifers where they exist. Terracing also reduces the amount of sediment transport and&#13;
particularly the coarse sediment which forms a bed load in watercourses.&#13;
2.17  Feeder Roads. The state of disrepair of roads and other infrastructure in Eritrea&#13;
has resulted largely from damage during the protracted war and the consequent neglect of&#13;
maintenance. The Government has, since independence, embarked on a program to&#13;
rehabilitate essential roads and bridges, and maintain its road network. The&#13;
Government's Macro-Policy is to develop trunk roads for domestic and regional services&#13;
and the comprehensive domestic network in stages. Efforts will also be made to&#13;
strengthen the institutional structures and establish the operational framework for the&#13;
continued maintenance of the improved network. In line with the overall process of&#13;
decentralization, the national administrative structure for the sector has been revised.&#13;
Rural roads will be improved and maintained through a partnership involving the&#13;
provincial Administrations, Districts, and local communities through their various&#13;
councils (Baitos), with some support from the Center.&#13;
2.18   The road network comprises three main classes of roads: Primary or Trunk,&#13;
Secondary, and Feeder roads (as well as community access road). A framework&#13;
agreement has been signed between the Ministry of Construction (MOC) and the&#13;
Ministry of Local Government (MOLG) which, inter alia, delineates responsibilities for&#13;
the various classes of roads. Under the new agreement, the responsibility for the&#13;
management and maintenance of feeder roads, as well as the maintenance only of&#13;
secondary roads will be assigned to the Regional Administrations. Technical design&#13;
standards will be established and approved by the Roads Department of the MOC. The&#13;
MOLG will coordinate the activities of the various regions and will not assume direct&#13;
responsibility for feeder roadworks. Community councils will organize the maintenance&#13;
of feeder roads with technical support from the Regional Administration.&#13;
2.19   Micro-finance. The Government's development strategy aims at a growth in&#13;
individual, family, and community economic self-reliance to free the country from&#13;
dependency on relief assistance and subsidies. The key to this goal is to promote&#13;
employment. In part, this will be accomplished by the expansion of the formal private&#13;
sector. However, this will need to be accompanied by a parallel development of the&#13;
informal sector, both urban and in the area of rural non-farming activities; and by a&#13;
strengthening of subsistence and surplus yielding traditional cultivation and pastoralism.&#13;
2.20  Broadening access to financial services is an essential step towards encouraging&#13;
individual and group initiative and thus reducing people's dependence on subsidized&#13;
public programs. Eritrea inherited from the previous regime a poorly diversified, narrow,&#13;
largely urban-based, government-owned financial sector. Lack of competition in the&#13;
system has contributed to low efficiency and poor services, adding to the lack of outreach&#13;
and lack of flexibility of formal financial institutions. It is now a Government's priority&#13;
to develop and diversify the financial sector, and, as part of this process, to encourage the&#13;
growth of micro-finance institutions, particularly in rural areas. While Government may&#13;
act as a catalyst in this endeavor, the aim is to rely on private group or community&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
initiatives. Eritrea's well established community structure (which have been accorded a&#13;
legal identity) and their familiarity with handling financial transactions, provides a basis&#13;
for the development of local micro-credit and savings groups. Improved access to credit&#13;
is an essential plank in the Government's efforts to promote the social and economic&#13;
status of women, and to facilitate the reintegration of displaced people and former&#13;
combatants. The improved provision of micro-credit will be accompanied by a vigorous&#13;
prograrn of technical training implemented in collaboration with the private sector.&#13;
2.21  In addition to improving access to financial services by both rural and urban&#13;
dwellers, the Government will support the growth of small, already established business&#13;
operating in areas beyond the outreach of formal financial institutions. These business&#13;
can make a strong contribution to employment creation and income generation&#13;
throughout the country, hence the need to ensure their access to credit and other services&#13;
they may require.&#13;
B. WORLD BANK COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FOR ERITREA&#13;
2.22  The Government's overall development strategy is accelerated and sustainable&#13;
broad-based economic growth, human resources development, and well targeted social&#13;
programs, all aimed at improving the living standards and reducing poverty. In line with&#13;
this policy, the Bank's program of assistance over the next three years will focus on&#13;
supporting the country's efforts towards rehabilitation and recovery, investment in&#13;
infrastructure and priority productive sectors, and the development of human resources,&#13;
all with the over-riding goal of reducing poverty. Since a large proportion of Eritrea's&#13;
population continues to suffer from lack of basic social services and doesn't have the&#13;
educational skills and access to capital that will enable it to fully participate in and benefit&#13;
from the recovery and growth process, the Bank's strategy aims to enhance the access to&#13;
and quality of basic social services for the poor and to support well targeted community-&#13;
based programs that will address the needs of the most vulnerable people in the society.&#13;
2.23  The Bank's strategy emphasizes: (i) supporting the participation of communities&#13;
in the development process, including the provision, management, and maintenance of&#13;
basic social services, and building community managerial and implementation capacity;&#13;
(ii) strengthening the role of local communities and other private sector institutions in the&#13;
financing of social services; (iii) the importance of improving cost-efficiency, and the&#13;
development of a national policy aiming at maximizing cost-recovery in the provision of&#13;
services; and (iv) a focus on women, including improving the participation of girls in&#13;
primary education, maternal health care, family planning services, increased literacy&#13;
among women, the use of labor-saving methods, and improving women' s income-earning&#13;
opportunities. The ECDF project will be an important contribution to achieving these&#13;
objectives by providing essential basic assets and services to poor communities,&#13;
improving the health and education status of large portions of the population, and&#13;
providing target groups, particularly women, with opportunities to increase incomes,&#13;
reduce vulnerability, and strengthen self-reliance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
C. LESSONS FROM OTHER SOCIAL FUNDS&#13;
2.24 Main Characteristics of Social Funds. The World Bank is financing social&#13;
funds and social programs in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and more recently Eastern&#13;
Europe, often with the support of other bilateral and multilateral donors. Although social&#13;
funds vary in design, they share some common basic features, that made them&#13;
particularly attractive to governments undertaking economic and political reforms aimed&#13;
at poverty reduction and the strengthening of local self-reliance. These include&#13;
simplicity, flexibility, low cost, and ability to generate visible benefits rapidly. Social&#13;
funds are essentially demand-driven programs, which involve the active and substantial&#13;
participation of the beneficiaries (usually community groups of one kind or another).&#13;
These funds generally operate through autonomous or semi-autonomous financial and&#13;
administrative structures, and use procedures for appraisal, procurement, and&#13;
disbursement designed to be simple, flexible, and rapidly responsive to community&#13;
demand, and which allow communities to participate in the management of the project&#13;
cycle. Social funds finance small sub-projects to improve basic infrastructure and&#13;
services, and it is customary for each category of sub-project to have funding ceilings to&#13;
ensure that the resources are directed at essential community needs.&#13;
2.25   Social funds generally differ from public sector implemented programs in two&#13;
important ways. Firstly, the social fund itself is not an implementing agency but relies on&#13;
beneficiaries, local community organizations, intermediaries, and contracted specialists to&#13;
implement projects. Secondly, social funds are often given certain levels of autonomy,&#13;
such as the right to employ their own staff on special salary scales, a system of financial&#13;
allocation and replenishment separate from the civil service budget, and their own set of&#13;
operating rules and procedures that may differ from the requirements of sector ministries.&#13;
Although some social funds have an organizational structure embedded within a&#13;
government agency, it is almost always the case that this structure has a separate identity.&#13;
Many social funds are established entirely outside the civil service as semi-autonomous&#13;
public agencies, and in a few cases, they have a semi-private or NGO status.&#13;
2.26  Findings of Recent Analyses. Several analyses and research studies have been&#13;
carried out on social funds, their strength, limitations, and conditions for success. These&#13;
include three World Bank studies: a study by the Africa Technical Department on "Social&#13;
Actions Programs and Social Funds, A Review of Design and Implementation in Sub-&#13;
Sahara Africa" (1993); a discussion paper prepared by the Education and Social Policy&#13;
Department on "Social Funds: Strengths, Weaknesses, and Conditions for Success"&#13;
(1995); and a technical note prepared by The Africa Human Resources and Poverty&#13;
Division entitled "Study of Procurement and Disbursement Issues in Projects with&#13;
Community Participation" (1994). A common finding of these studies is that social funds&#13;
are successful when they: (i) have support and commitment from highest political level&#13;
to preserve the integrity of the fund, its objectives and mandate; (ii) are able to operate&#13;
with sufficient autonomy to respond rapidly and directly to community demands, while at&#13;
the same time having clear accountability and transparency of operation; (iii) promote the&#13;
participation of beneficiary communities in sub-project identification and implementation&#13;
to ensure that proposals are genuinely beneficiary-initiated; (iv) have a qualified, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
committed motivated staff and a system of incentives based on merit; (v) have a rigorous&#13;
management and MIS system and a streamlined organizational structure; (vi) have&#13;
flexible financing mechanisms subject to a rigorous appraisal process; (vii) have an&#13;
effective coordinating mechanism with line ministries; (viii) have an intensive and&#13;
thorough process of supervision and audit; and, (ix) operate in an action-research mode to&#13;
learn from experience through mechanisms such as beneficiary assessments, research on&#13;
patterns of implementation, and exchange of views with sector and community experts.&#13;
2.27 Major Issues and Limitations. The following have been identified as the major&#13;
issues, challenges, and limitations social funds may experience. They may face a trade-&#13;
off between rapid implementation of quality projects, and building indigenous&#13;
institutional and technical capacity. They have shown limited success in implementing&#13;
credit programs, especially where the fund attempts to operate as a retailer of credit.&#13;
Because they have limited resources, to be effective they must be an integral part of a&#13;
larger program to reduce poverty. Finally, to generate genuine and reliable community&#13;
demand for social fund support, they must be able to directly reach out to poor&#13;
beneficiaries and communities, rather than rely on indirect methods of assessing local&#13;
needs.&#13;
2.28  Major Strengths and Potential. Small infrastructure projects have generally&#13;
been the most successful type of social fund initiative in terms of quality, sustainability,&#13;
and beneficial impact, providing communities with assets that directly increase incomes&#13;
and production. Small projects concerned with social assistance and income-generating&#13;
are usually more complex and labor-intensive, and their success depends on the capacity&#13;
of local support organizations. However, if designed in a way that maximizes their&#13;
special potential, social funds can provide a parallel track to the conventional public-&#13;
sector planning cycle, allowing a community with energy and commitment to launch&#13;
initiatives within its own time-frame. Social funds are an effective way of encouraging&#13;
private efforts which can often deliver more cost-effective results than the public sector&#13;
can achieve alone. A number of social funds (including the ECRF pilot) have shown that&#13;
community-initiated infrastructure projects can be implemented at a lower cost than&#13;
equivalent publicly managed projects. The social fund mechanism can be an effective&#13;
way of obtaining community investments, which reduces the cost to public funds and&#13;
establishes a basis of ownership around which maintenance arrangements can be built.&#13;
Finally, the experience of social fund participation can make a valuable contribution to&#13;
community development, by helping to build managerial competencies, encouraging&#13;
community decision-making on shared assets, and developing a sense of achievement and&#13;
self-reliance.&#13;
D. THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PILOT COMMUNITY REHABILITATION FUND&#13;
2.29  Main Characteristics of the Pilot Project. The Eritrean Community&#13;
Rehabilitation Fund (ECRF) was launched as a pilot operation in April 1993, as part of&#13;
the Recovery and Rehabilitation Program for Eritrea (RRPE) with financing from IDA&#13;
(US$ 1 million), Italy (US$ 4.6 million), the Netherlands (US$ 0.78 million), and&#13;
Australia (US$ 1 million). UNDP provided technical assistance and management support&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
for project implementation. The Government's financial contribution was US$ 3 million&#13;
equivalent, bringing the financial resources to a total of US$ 10.38 million. ECRF's main&#13;
objective was to support the rehabilitation and construction of basic social and economic&#13;
infrastructure (basic health facilities, primary schools, micro-dams, water schemes, flood&#13;
control structures, feeder roads and bridges). The pilot ECRF was implemented in all 9&#13;
provinces of the country, with particular focus on the very remote areas and those most&#13;
damaged by the effects of the war. More than 90% of sub-projects were implemented in&#13;
rural areas. All phases of the ECRF project cycle have involved significant community&#13;
participation, with communities contributing at least the mandatory 10% of project costs&#13;
(but in many cases more). The pilot phase, which is due to close in February 1996, has&#13;
provided the basis for testing the feasibility and viability of community-initiated&#13;
development activities, and for determining whether this experience would justify a&#13;
continuation and expansion of the ECRF. Based on the successful evaluation of the pilot,&#13;
the Government has decided to continue and expand the operation of the ECRF as a fully-&#13;
fledged program. The expansion (which the proposed project will support) is based&#13;
closely on the structure and modalities of the pilot. Therefore the paragraphs below&#13;
provide details of the most important features of the pilot operation.&#13;
2.30  Organization and Structure of the Pilot Fund. The ECRF pilot has been&#13;
managed by an autonomous group within the Ministry of Local Government. The&#13;
structure of this group consists of a Central Unit in Asmara, and nine Sub-Units located&#13;
in the offices of the Local Government Provincial Administrations. The role of the Sub-&#13;
Units is to screen and appraise sub-project proposals submitted by communities, and&#13;
submit those that are judged as viable to the Central Unit. There the appraisals are&#13;
reviewed, final financing decisions taken, contractual arrangements set up with the&#13;
beneficiary communities, and the implementation program established. The Central&#13;
Office has carried the major responsibility for procurement and disbursement, and for&#13;
close liaison with sector ministries. The Sub-Units have carried responsibility for the&#13;
community promotion and outreach and assisting communities to develop sub-project&#13;
proposals, and for supervising and assisting the implementation process. The Central&#13;
Unit has consisted of a General Manager, and 7 professionals, and each Sub-Unit had a&#13;
Project Officer (usually a qualified engineer), and was managed by the Head of the&#13;
Provincial Development and Reconstruction Office who is employed and paid under the&#13;
local government structure.&#13;
2.31  The Project Cycle. The project cycle begins with outreach activities to explain to&#13;
communities what type of project can be funded by ECRF and the terms of community&#13;
participation/contribution. On receipt of community sub-project proposals, the Project&#13;
Officer visits the site and appraises the project. The Local Government Provincial&#13;
Administration checks that the proposed sub-project is in line with sectoral development&#13;
policies and priorities, and that funds will be allocated by the provincial sector agency to&#13;
cover recurrent expenditures. Line ministries provide standard designs or guidelines for&#13;
project implementation. Appraised proposals are then sent to the Central Unit for review&#13;
and final approval (or deferral or rejection). For those proposals approved, agreements&#13;
with local community, giving particular attention to arrangements for maintenance and&#13;
sustainability of the infrastructure to be built are signed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
2.32  Projects are implemented by local contractors selected through a process of&#13;
competitive bidding. Where there are no private contractors available, implementation&#13;
has been carried by NGOs or Local Governments together with local communities.&#13;
Community committees and the ECRF Project Officers supervise project implementation,&#13;
monitoring quality control, and compliance with works schedule. The ECRF project cycle&#13;
has typically lasted approximately 6 months: 2 months for preparation, and 4 months for&#13;
implementation, although these periods vary by type of infrastructure and area.&#13;
2.33   Community Participation and Contribution. Eritrea has a long tradition of&#13;
community participation and the investment of community resources in the provision of&#13;
local infrastructure and services. This has been a special feature of community life where&#13;
councils of elders (known as Baitos) are responsible for decisions concerning the&#13;
collective welfare of the community. During the liberation struggle, the EPLF promoted&#13;
the establishment of locally elected councils, and after independence these bodies (which&#13;
kept the traditional name of Baitos) were formally allocated a wide range of powers and&#13;
responsibilities. Village and district Baibos prioritize community needs for development&#13;
support, and transmit their priorities to the Provincial Administration. During the Pilot,&#13;
Committees of these Baitos have acted as the main liaison between the communities and&#13;
the ECRF.&#13;
2.34  Communities have made a contribution of at least 10 percent to implementation&#13;
costs of a sub-project either in cash, kind, labor, or in a blend of these, depending on the&#13;
resources available within the community. It has been the goal of the ECRF to maximize&#13;
the level of community contribution, while being sensitive to the limits of especially poor&#13;
communities. Besides supervising contractors, community committees are responsible for&#13;
storing the construction materials; and when it is specified in the project contract,&#13;
communities contribute free labor (for example, carrying water, and unloading trucks)&#13;
and some materials (generally, stones, gravel, and sand). It is also responsibility of the&#13;
community committees to draw up schedules for the work of local people at the sites.&#13;
When a number of communities have contributed to a project (for example, for feeder&#13;
road rehabilitation), they have been responsible for managing coordination among&#13;
themselves.&#13;
2.35  Achievements of the Pilot ECRF. The operational timetable of the pilot ECRF&#13;
has been divided into three phases. During the first phase, ECRF implemented projects&#13;
mainly in basic health and education - rehabilitation and construction of elementary&#13;
schools, health centers, and health stations. In phases two and three, ECRF broadened its&#13;
portfolio, including sub-projects supporting small-scale irrigation, water supply, and&#13;
feeder roads. In February 1995, the ECRF had implemented 75 sub-projects, consisting of&#13;
34 elementary schools, 17 health stations, 9 health centers, 3 bridge reconstructions, I&#13;
flood control program, I feeder road, and 8 water supply projects. In addition, using&#13;
Government funds, the ECRF reconstructed I senior secondary school , and I regional&#13;
hospital. At the same date, ECRF had received and appraised more than 250 proposals.&#13;
The third phase, presently under implementation, has a pipeline of about 80 projects,&#13;
mostly in basic social sectors, water supply, and small-scale irrigation. It is expected that&#13;
by the end of the pilot phase ECRF will have implemented more than 150 sub-projects.&#13;

2.36   In Table I are given some data on the financial parameters of the pilot fund.&#13;
About 700,000 beneficiaries were helped by the projects funded by ECRF. Given the&#13;
poor social indicators discussed above this pattern of expenditures seems appropriate. For&#13;
elementary schools and health centers the average cost to the Fund was lower than for&#13;
comparable projects executed by the relevant ministries by 30%. For health stations it&#13;
was slightly higher (10%) mainly because of three health stations set up in the remote&#13;
province of Dankalia. Community contribution in the form of cash, materials and labor&#13;
made up about 10% of total costs for these social infrastructure sub-projects. The&#13;
community contribution was higher, 84% (mainly in the form of labor) for the micro-&#13;
dams, and about 16% for other physical infrastructure sub-projects, for which the social&#13;
rate of return could be considered to be lower.&#13;
2.37   Result of the Mid-Term Evaluation. A mid-term evaluation was carried out in&#13;
September 1994, by a team composed of local and international independent consultants.&#13;
The objectives of the evaluation were to: (i) assess the quality of sub-project&#13;
implementation and community participation; (ii) analyze the balance of ECRF's project&#13;
portfolio; (iii) determine the relevance of ECRF-financed sub-projects to community&#13;
needs; (iv) assess the management of sub-project operations; and (v) assess the scope for&#13;
an expansion of ECRF activities, including the identification of capacity building needs.&#13;
ECRF's overall performance was assessed as satisfactory, especially given the difficulties&#13;
due to the country situation in the immediate aftermath of the war, and the severe&#13;
constraints (in terms of staffing and equipment) under which the Fund had to operate&#13;
during its initial stage of operations. The evaluation identified the ECRF's greatest asset&#13;
as its dedicated staff, and their problem-solving capacity and determination to succeed&#13;
against substantial obstacles. The evaluation judged the most important achievements of&#13;
the ECRF to be its outreach capacity to communities, specially in remote areas; and the&#13;
quality and cost-effectiveness of the sub-projects implemented. The evaluation also made&#13;
recommendations concerning four major areas: (i) capacity building, staff training and&#13;
recruitment; (ii) expansion of ECRF activities; (iii) ECRF operations; and (iv) social&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
infrastructure projects. Annex B gives a detailed summary of the evaluation of the pilot&#13;
project, and the evaluation document is available in the Project file.&#13;
3.   THE PROJECT&#13;
A. ORIGINS OF THE PROJECT&#13;
3.1   The Eritrea Community Rehabilitation Fund (ECRF) was established as a pilot&#13;
(within the Recovery and Rehabilitation Program for Eritrea) to test a community-based&#13;
mechanism aimed at improving the economic and social conditions of the rural poor&#13;
especially in very remote and devastated areas of the country. The pilot phase was&#13;
intended to pave the way for a future expanded community-based program. The&#13;
evaluation and mid-term review demonstrated that the pilot ECRF accomplished its&#13;
objectives, and the Government concluded that its satisfactory performance justifies the&#13;
expansion of the fund's activities in terns of both volume of project investments and&#13;
sectors covered. In October 1994, the ECRF management team started the preparatory&#13;
activities for the expanded phase, and in January 1995, the Government requested Bank&#13;
assistance. The follow-up program will be implemented under the name "Eritrea&#13;
Community Development Fund" (ECDF), to emphasize that the fund will focus on&#13;
sustainable development interventions, shifting from the emphasis on recovery and&#13;
rehabilitation of the pilot phase.&#13;
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.2   The Project's objectives are to finance community-based sub-projects which will:&#13;
(i) support the rehabilitation and development of basic social and economic infrastructure&#13;
critical to the improvement and development of the economic and social conditions of the&#13;
population, especially in the remote and war devastated areas of Eritrea; and (ii) improve&#13;
the income-generating capacity of poor people and households. These will include: (i)&#13;
social sector projects, including the rehabilitation and construction of basic social&#13;
infrastructure and provision of social services using labor-intensive techniques and&#13;
community participation (construction or rehabilitation of primary schools, junior&#13;
secondary schools, health stations, health centers and clinics; water pumps and other&#13;
water supply sources; sanitation and the supply of basic equipment; as well as the&#13;
provision of basic social services); (ii) activities that will be beneficial to environment&#13;
conservation and rehabilitation in areas severely affected by soil erosion, excessive run-&#13;
off and high levels of deforestation (including check dams and hillside terraces, tree&#13;
planting and other related activities that have a positive impact on the environment); (iii)&#13;
implementation of pilot micro savings and credit schemes; (iv) economic resources&#13;
management projects which will be simple in design and implemented using labor-&#13;
intensive techniques (including reconstruction and extensive rehabilitation of feeder&#13;
roads, market storage facilities and other similar infrastructure); and. (v) capacity&#13;
building to increase the ability of communities to identify development priorities, manage&#13;
project implementation, and maintain assets (including those built with the ECDF&#13;
support), and to strengthen regional and local government institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
3.3   The project supports several imperatives in the need of improving the socio-&#13;
economic environment, particularly the Government's Macro-Policy which establishes&#13;
the framework for Eritrea's development. The ECDF will make an important contribution&#13;
to the Government's human resource development priority, by assisting communities to&#13;
construct or rehabilitate basic social infrastructure, and improve the quality of basic&#13;
social services. It will also respond to the need of reducing poverty and dependency on&#13;
relief assistance by providing poor members of local communities, that cannot survive&#13;
on traditional agricultural activities, with alternative income-generation options. Finally,&#13;
the ECDF is a representative model of the thrust of the Government's development&#13;
strategy, which emphasizes decentralized responsibility; community self-help; private&#13;
initiative and cost-sharing; the redress of the inequalities among regions, and social&#13;
groups, especially women; and, care for the environment and local responsibility for&#13;
conservation.&#13;
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.4   The ECDF will be a demand-driven program. It will finance sub-projects that&#13;
have been identified and requested by local communities, and in whose design,&#13;
implementation, monitoring, maintenance and sustainability local communities will play&#13;
a key role. On an exceptional basis, ECDF in collaboration with regional and local&#13;
government institutions will also assist local communities which do not have strong&#13;
organizational capacity in assessing their priorities, promote sub-projects' proposals and&#13;
implement them. Sub-projects will be appraised to ensure that: (i) they are&#13;
developmental rather than relief in nature; (ii) they are sustainable, because the assets&#13;
created with ECDF support will be well maintained and recurrent costs covered by the&#13;
relevant line Ministry in partnership with local communities; (iii) they respond to&#13;
priorities of poor communities; (iv) the investment is justified in terms of economic, and&#13;
social returns; (v) they support the Government's environmental conservation and&#13;
rehabilitation objectives; and (vi) they are consistent with the Government's sector&#13;
development strategies. For each sub-project it is mandatory that the benefiting&#13;
community form a Community Project Committee, which will be party to contractual&#13;
arrangements with the ECDF. The ECDF will operate a capacity building program of&#13;
promotion, education and training to assist communities to participate actively in the sub-&#13;
project cycle.&#13;
3.5   The ECDF does not implement projects, but supports and facilitates the efforts of&#13;
local communities, and ensures the provision of technical expertise in project&#13;
implementation and management wherever the community needs. The implementation of&#13;
the rehabilitation works will be carried out in a decentralized, pragmatic and flexible way,&#13;
and will give a large responsibility to the community for preparation and supervision.&#13;
1. Organizational Structure of ECDF&#13;
3.6   The ECDF will operate as an autonomous structure within the Ministry of Local&#13;
Government. It will have a Management Office (MO) which will be responsible for the&#13;
overall project implementation, and oversee 6 Regional Branches, one in each region of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
the country, responsible for community outreach, and for receiving, screening,&#13;
appraising, and recommending conmmunity proposals for ECDF support. Agreement on&#13;
the structure of ECDF, including the size of the staff, has been reached at Appraisal. The&#13;
proposed organization chart for the ECDF is shown in Annex E; and the map indicates the&#13;
location of the Regional Branches.&#13;
3.7   Management Office. The Management Office will be headed by a General&#13;
Manager (assisted by a Deputy General Manager), who will be responsible for: (i) the&#13;
overall coordination of ECDF's activities and ensuring that the ECDF operates according&#13;
to the procedures set up in the Operational Manual; (ii) ensure consistency of ECDF's&#13;
operations with GOE policy; (iii) exercising quality and financial control, and supervising&#13;
and monitoring the activities of the regional branches; (iv) consulting with line ministries&#13;
on issues of sector strategy, technical standards, and provision for recurrent costs and&#13;
services related to ECDF-financed infrastructure; (v) consolidating the pipeline of sub-&#13;
project proposals received from the Regional Branches into an Annual Work Program&#13;
and Budget, and submit it to the Ministry of Finance; (vi) carrying out all international&#13;
procurement and most of the local procurement (this function will be gradually phased&#13;
out, consistently with the development of local markets and increased managerial&#13;
capacity in the Regional Branches); (vii) preparing an annual progress and financial&#13;
report; (viii) managing a central Monitoring and Information System providing details of&#13;
achievements and progress in ECDF activities; (ix) managing the capacity building&#13;
program and research and study fund; providing technical support to the Regional&#13;
Branches and assist them in gradually enhancing their capability in sub-project appraisal,&#13;
implementation, monitoring and evaluation; (x) acting as the main operational contact&#13;
point with financing donor agencies; and, (xi) representing the ECDF in all legal matters.&#13;
3.8   Structure of the Management Office. The Management Office will consist of 4&#13;
functional Divisions with specialized staff working under the supervision of a division&#13;
manager. The first is an Engineering Division with 6 engineers (I head of the imit and 5&#13;
Project Officers) responsible for carrying out the final review of sub-project appraisals&#13;
submitted by the Regional Branches, and making financing recommendations to the&#13;
General Manager. For approved sub-projects, the division supervises the establishment&#13;
of implementation arrangements, ensuring the involvement of community committees,&#13;
line ministry representatives, and in some cases implementing agencies acting on behalf&#13;
of the community. The division also contains two survey crews responsible for technical&#13;
preparation and project design. The second is a Logistics Division responsible for&#13;
procurement, storage and transportation of centrally held construction materials to the&#13;
project sites. The Finance and Accounting Division is responsible for disbursement,&#13;
accounting, and preparation of the Annual Work Program and Budget, and the Annual&#13;
Progress and Financial Report. The Savings and Credit Division will be responsible for&#13;
the management of the pilot savings and credit program. There will also be supporting&#13;
staff in the areas of Management Coordination and Administration, and MIS. A&#13;
Promotion and Training Officer will be located in the MO, to manage and coordinate all&#13;
training and capacity building activities.&#13;
3.9   Evaluation Committee. The General Manager will establish in the MO an&#13;
Evaluation Committee composed of heads of the concerned divisions, with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
responsibility of recommending the approval or rejection of sub-project proposals&#13;
received and pre-screened from the Regional Branches; the awarding of contracts and&#13;
other tasks related to sub-projects implementation as described in the Operational&#13;
Manual.&#13;
3.10 Regional Branches. There will be an ECDF Regional Branch in each region of&#13;
the country. The head of the Regional Branch will be the Chief Managing Director in the&#13;
Regional Office of the MOLG, accountable to the ECDF General Manager in matters&#13;
related to ECDF activities. The Manager of the Regional Branch will have the following&#13;
duties: (i) conducting procurement at local level to the extent authorized by the MO; (ii)&#13;
monitoring the appraisal and implementation of sub-projects; and (iii) authorizing&#13;
payment certificates as required by the Operational Manual. Each Regional Branch will&#13;
have Project Officers in areas of ECDF activity including Engineering, Savings and&#13;
Credit, and Finance and Accounting, the number and type depending on the workload.&#13;
The main activities of the Regional Branches will include: (i) promotion of ECDF&#13;
activities among local communities; (ii)assisting local communities in sub-project&#13;
proposal preparation, and appraisal, and supervision of sub-projects; (iii) ensuring close&#13;
working relationship with target communities, supporting them during implementation,&#13;
and assuring close coordination among on-going ECDF activities; and, (iv) undertaking&#13;
procurement activities, when authorized by the MO, and entering into contracts on behalf&#13;
of ECDF in conformity with the guidelines described in the Operational Manual. The&#13;
Regional Branch will also be responsible for contracting local manpower.&#13;
3.11  ECDF will have its own salary structure, based on market levels and designed to&#13;
attract, motivate, and retain high caliber staff. The salary structure will include a system&#13;
of hardship and other allowances.&#13;
2. Project Approach&#13;
3.12  Operational Manual. A detailed Operational Manual has been developed, which&#13;
satisfies both Government and IDA requirements, and all ECDF activities will be&#13;
regulated by the Operational Manual. Necessary modifications to the Operational Manual&#13;
can be made with the agreement of IDA. The Operational Manual contains the policy&#13;
framework, aims and objectives of the Fund; its organization and functions; the roles,&#13;
responsibilities and authority of ECDF staff and other participating parties; the criteria&#13;
and procedures for identification, appraisal, implementation, supervision, monitoring, and&#13;
evaluation of sub-projects; the implementation, procurement, and disbursement&#13;
arrangements; and the monitoring, reporting, accounting and auditing requirements.&#13;
Annexes to the Manual provide sample contracting documents and standard forms for use&#13;
in processing sub-projects; general sub-project selection criteria; specific check-lists for&#13;
rural water supply, feeder roads, social and economic infrastructure sub-projects;&#13;
environmental assessment; and, job descriptions and professional profiles for all&#13;
professionals to be hired by ECDF in the MO and Regional Branches. A summary of the&#13;
contents of the Manual is provided in Annex H, and the full Manual is part of the Project&#13;
File. The Manual also covers the Savings and Credit sub-projects. The Manual has been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
finalized and agreed upon at Negotiation, and adopted by ECDF before Board&#13;
Presentation.&#13;
3.13 Technical Handbooks. The Operational Manual will be supplemented by&#13;
Technical Handbooks on Rural Water Supply, Environment, Rural Feeder Roads and&#13;
MIS. The implementation of capacity building and training activity will be supported by&#13;
a Capacity Building Support Document. Handbooks will include project design,&#13;
appraisal, and implementation guidelines; technical standards and specifications; training&#13;
materials for communities and other agents involved in implementation. The Handbooks&#13;
will be prepared by the Management Office in collaboration with local or international&#13;
consultants (if needed), on the basis of terms of reference agreed upon during Appraisal&#13;
(TORs are available in the project file). It has also been agreed that work on the&#13;
Handbooks will start before the beginning of the expanded phase, and that it will be&#13;
completed before the end of the first year of project implementation.&#13;
3. Project Cycle&#13;
3.14  Promotional Phase. The pilot ECRF carried out an intensive promotional&#13;
activity, at the national and local level, gathering information about community needs,&#13;
and disseminating information about the Fund's opportunities and procedures. The&#13;
expanded ECDF will build upon the experience gained during the pilot project,&#13;
organizing the promotion activities at two levels. At the local level, the objectives will be:&#13;
(i) to promote the objectives of ECDF among local communities, explain its operating&#13;
mechanisms and benefits, and place ECDF in the context of other on-going or planned&#13;
developmental initiatives that involve the community; and, (ii) to assess the capacity of&#13;
the community to identify needs, prepare and submit proposals, implement and manage&#13;
sub-projects. ECDF Regional Branches staff will participate in Baito meetings and other&#13;
community events, and organize presentations of ECDF activities for community groups&#13;
and committees.&#13;
3.15  Promotion at the nationial level will be carried out under the leadership of the&#13;
General Manager, and will consist of an intensive campaign to increase awareness and&#13;
gain support for the Fund's activities among government officials, national associations&#13;
and organizations concerned with poverty reduction, community leaders and&#13;
representatives, and a variety of facilitating agencies. This campaign will be conducted&#13;
through the media, distribution of brochures and ECDF's publications, and the&#13;
organization of meetings, seminars, workshops and orientation sessions.&#13;
3.16  Screening and Appraisal Procedures. Following the promotion phase,&#13;
communities may develop and submit proposals for Fund support through their&#13;
representatives to the ECDF Regional Branch. A "community" can be a village, a group&#13;
of villages, a district area, a cluster of communities in the case of infrastructure covering&#13;
more than one community (such as feeder road rehabilitation), a neighborhood in urban&#13;
areas, or (in the case of micro-credit), a group of individuals collaborating in a business&#13;
venture. Communities will be represented by properly constituted Community Project&#13;
Committees. Once a proposal is received: the Regional Branch screens it to assess&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
whether it falls within the ECD)F mandate; reflects the needs and priorities of the&#13;
community and its commitment to sustain the facility financed by ECDF; is presented in&#13;
a complete enough form; and appears feasible and sound in terms of technical details,&#13;
cost and likely benefits, and implementability. Each proposal is recorded in the ECDF&#13;
MIS system, and those positively screened are submitted to the Regional Branch for&#13;
clearance to appraise. The appraisal, which includes a field visit, assesses the&#13;
acceptability of the proposal on the basis of the sub-project's location, its sector/sub-&#13;
sector, its likely benefits to beneficiaries, and the commitment of the relevant sectoral&#13;
ministry or community group to cover recurrent costs associated with the sub-project.&#13;
During the field visit, the Project Officer gives special attention to the broader impact of&#13;
the sub-project on the community and special groups within the community (especially&#13;
poor women); the likely returns on investment; factors determining both effective&#13;
utilization and sustainability; the extent to which the project satisfies technical standards&#13;
for the sector and is sensitive to environmental goals; the realism of project costings; the&#13;
arrangements for implementation and supervision; and the commitment of beneficiaries&#13;
to maintenance. A crucial factor is the cornmunity's own investment, which will be at&#13;
least 10 percent of the project costs, in the form of cash, materials, labor or other services.&#13;
In exceptional cases, the ECDF will agree that particularly poor communities be allowed&#13;
to contribute to the sub-projects' costs with less than 10 percent. During appraisal, the&#13;
Project Officer coordinates with the regional department of the relevant sector ministry,&#13;
to assess that the sub-project is: (i) in line with the technical standards approved by the&#13;
ministry; (ii) consistent with the sector development strategy for the region; and (iii)&#13;
covered in terms of its recurrent costs by an allocation in the regional government&#13;
approved budget, or by a cost-sharing arrangement with the interested community. Only&#13;
those sub-projects that satisfy these requirements can be considered for ECDF support.&#13;
3.17  After the appraisal of each sub-project the project Officer drafts an Appraisal&#13;
Report which includes a tentative Implementation Schedule, developed in collaboration&#13;
with the community; a Monitoring Schedule specifying the role of community and&#13;
ECDF; and an estimate on supervision needs. The Project Officer's Appraisal Report is&#13;
reviewed by the Head of the Regional Branch to determine whether it is suitable for&#13;
transmission to the Management Office, and what recommendation should be made.&#13;
There are three possible recommendations: approval, rejection, or request for further&#13;
study (such as a technical feasibility assessment). The Regional Branch records its&#13;
recommendations, and in each case transmits the recommendation to the Management&#13;
Office, accompanied by the project file which includes the project request form; a copy of&#13;
the appraisal report with attached a Community Involvement Form and Implementation&#13;
Schedule; a copy of the project indicative budget; in the case of standard construction&#13;
projects, a copy of the plans; and the record of the Regional Branch recommendation.&#13;
When the infrastructure is not based on a standard design the MO in consultation with the&#13;
Regional Branch may request the services of the technical crew within the ECDF, or of&#13;
an external consultant.&#13;
3.18 Sub-Project Appraisal Review and Approval. The Engineering Unit in the&#13;
Management Office is responsible for reviewing all Regional Branch appraisal&#13;
submissions, and proposing action to the General Manager, who then communicates the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
final decision to the Regional Branch. When sub-projects are approved, the Management&#13;
Office prepares a disbursement schedule, bidding documents, arrangements for&#13;
procurement, and contracts, and reviews the cost-estimates. The Regional Branch&#13;
arranges for the ECDF and the Community Project Committee to sign a Financing&#13;
Agreement which describes the goals, nature and cost of the sub-project, accountability&#13;
and liability, the amount and nature of the community's contribution to project costs,&#13;
arrangements for implementation and supervision, disbursement arrangements, special&#13;
actions that will be needed to mitigate negative environmental effects, and follow up&#13;
arrangements for maintenance of assets and recurrent costs. Examples of Financing&#13;
Agreements are included as annexes to the Operational Manual.&#13;
3.19  Implementation Arrangements. Implementation arrangements will be kept&#13;
flexible to reflect different conditions in different areas of the country in terms of&#13;
availability of contractors, services, materials. The general principles that will guide&#13;
implementation will be to: (i) maximize community involvement and responsibility; (ii)&#13;
ensure adequate quality; and, (iii) ensure the most cost-effective methods through a&#13;
competitive bidding process. A number of implementing arrangements are possible,&#13;
including: (i) implementation by or on behalf of community; (ii) implementation by&#13;
Local Government Construction Units; and (iii) self-help projects. In the first case, if the&#13;
benefiting community has the institutional capacity to implement the project, the village&#13;
council or its Community Committee may act as the implementing agency; where the&#13;
Community Committees do not have implementation capacity, they may require the&#13;
ECDF to act on their behalf in matters of procurement and contracting, and on their part&#13;
supervise and monitor project implementation and manage aspects related to community&#13;
contribution. In exceptional cases, where private independent contractors are not&#13;
available, the Local Government Units will be closely involved in the implementation of&#13;
the project. In such cases, regional line government agencies will provide technical&#13;
support as their contribution to the project. However, in all such cases, the Financing&#13;
Agreement will be signed with the Community Committee, who will be responsible for&#13;
handling funds and contracting necessary labor and materials for the proposed activity.&#13;
Finally, in the case of self-help projects ECDF would provide the materials and the&#13;
Community Committee would organize and provide the labor. More details on different&#13;
implementation and procurement arrangements are given in section I below.&#13;
D. PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
1. Social and Economic Infrastructure and Services&#13;
3.20  The ECDF will operate within the framework of overall national development&#13;
priorities, and will not preclude any specific sector from consideration. Based on&#13;
extensive needs assessments and the experience of the pilot project which has already&#13;
provided a pipeline of community requests for the expanded phase, it is anticipated that&#13;
the bulk of ECDF-financed economic and social infrastructure sub-projects will fall into&#13;
the following categories: primary health; basic education; rural water supply; soil, water&#13;
and forestry conservation; and rural feeder roads.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
3.21   Social Sector Infrastructure and Services. In the social sectors, ECDF support&#13;
would help communities willing to invest to increase their access to basic health and&#13;
education, and would assist communities to increase the efficiency of basic social&#13;
services delivery (including the utilization of facilities provided through ECRF&#13;
financing). This should help to maximize the return on both public as well as private&#13;
investments by the communities themselves, and encourage a shift to greater community&#13;
participation and accountability. Social sector infrastructure projects would aim to&#13;
integrate with relevant aspects of other sector sub-projects, such as rural water supply and&#13;
sanitation, with health and education.&#13;
3.22  Primary Health. The rehabilitation, expansion, and construction of primary&#13;
health care facilities (health stations and health centers) in areas where these facilities are&#13;
unavailable, would be a core part of this aspect of ECDF support. The provision of this&#13;
infrastructure would be carefully coordinated with the Ministry of Health and their local&#13;
offices, and would be based on Government standards and regulations for these facilities.&#13;
Annex J provides details of these standards, and of the cost assumptions. In this way,&#13;
there would be a direct link between the provision of infrastructure, and the services and&#13;
maintenance necessary for these to operate. Recurrent costs would be shared by the&#13;
Government and local communities. The Ministry and regional administrations would be&#13;
responsible for the training and salaries of health workers, and the provision of essential&#13;
supplies; the ECDF, as agreed with the Ministry of Health would provide furniture and&#13;
refrigeration equipment, wherever possible making purchases of these supplies on the&#13;
local market where these are reasonably priced. The communities would make a wide&#13;
variety of in-kind contributions related to the maintenance of the facilities, and their&#13;
everyday operation. In addition, the Government is designing a system of cost-recovery&#13;
through user charges that will be used to defray some portion of recurrent expenses&#13;
currently borne by the Government budget.&#13;
3.23  The primary health component would emphasize health aspects of environmental&#13;
sanitation and water supply. In addition, the construction of primary health infrastructure&#13;
may be complemented by activities, such as training and the provision of improved local&#13;
services, that can be managed on a community basis. These activities would respond to&#13;
local needs, such as improvements in family health and nutrition practices, family&#13;
planning, improved sanitation, and pre and post-natal health counseling. In all of these&#13;
activities, the ECDF would work closely with local health officials to complement and&#13;
assist, and not duplicate health programs planned or in operation. These training and&#13;
services activities will pay special attention to women beneficiaries, and other groups in&#13;
special need, such as the disabled and aged. An important aspect of ECDF activity would&#13;
be the piloting of labor-saving methods to help alleviate the burden of women's work to&#13;
encourage attention to health and nutrition problems.&#13;
3.24  Basic Education. ECDF's activities in this sector would include the&#13;
rehabilitation, expansion, or construction, and equipping of primary schools, and junior&#13;
secondary schools in areas where communities lack, request and are willing to invest in&#13;
these basic facilities. All schools would be provided according to Government standards,&#13;
and efforts would be made to adopt a flexible approach, providing smaller schools to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
isolated communities that are far away from larger village clusters. Annex J provides&#13;
details of the Government standards and the costing of this component. Recurrent costs&#13;
associated with the maintenance of the facilities and the provision of educational services,&#13;
as well as of other types of sub-projects are dealt with in the following section. The&#13;
responsibility for recurrent costs would be shared by the Government, and local&#13;
communities. The division of responsibility is likely to evolve over time as the&#13;
Government prepares a detailed sector investment plan and implements cost recovery&#13;
mechanisms. Currently, the general policy is that the Ministry of Education covers the&#13;
cost of teacher training and salaries, and because of shortages, textbooks are lent to pupils&#13;
(who often have to share them) and recovered for subsequent use. Communities&#13;
customarily make contributions in the form of maintenance of facilities, provision of&#13;
services (such as food), in some cases housing for teachers, and other forms of&#13;
participation in the running of the schools. However, there are areas where communities&#13;
have been contributing to teacher salaries, and one or two provinces have already been&#13;
experimenting with school fees and sale of textbooks.&#13;
3.25   As in the case of primary health facilities, the ECDF would work closely with the&#13;
responsible Ministry (of Education) and its local representatives, guided by Government&#13;
construction standards. The ECDF would encourage community participation in basic&#13;
education management through parents' committees, and support efforts to improve the&#13;
educational participation and performance of girls. The ECDF would also support&#13;
community efforts to make the school facility a center for other community activities,&#13;
such as basic skills training and pre-school child care centers.&#13;
3.26 Rural Water Supply. The water supply component would improve access to&#13;
safe drinking water in under-served areas by supporting projects which rehabilitate and/or&#13;
augment existing supplies, and develop new sources. All requests for new projects would&#13;
therefore be reviewed to determine whether or not the rehabilitation of an existing source&#13;
is a viable alternative. Rehabilitation would focus on protecting existing sources,&#13;
improving access to safe water by repairing, fitting or replacing failed equipment (e.g.&#13;
handpumps), and building distribution networks from existing point sources for large&#13;
communities. The development of new sources would be focused on three schemes&#13;
typologies: hand dug wells, bore holes, and piped water systems to allow ECDF to&#13;
accommodate requests from communities of different sizes (250 - 8,000 persons) and&#13;
characteristics (nomadic and sedentary). On an exceptional basis, and only where none of&#13;
these alternative is technically feasible, other alternatives would be considered.&#13;
3.27  To the extent possible, drinking water supply sub-projects would be integrated&#13;
with health and education sub-projects. All health and education sub-projects would&#13;
include water and sanitation facilities. Drinking water supply sub-projects would also&#13;
take into consideration other economic water supply requirements - such as livestock&#13;
watering and kitchen gardening, and, where possible, these will be provided for. The&#13;
practice of collecting user charges for both drinking water supply and livestock watering&#13;
is already established in some parts of Eritrea, and the project would support and build on&#13;
this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
3.28  Beneficiary communities would be fully responsible for the operation and&#13;
maintenance (recurrent costs) of their water supplies. This is a requirement of the ECDF,&#13;
and an agreement between the Fund and the community would be drawn up to reflect this&#13;
commitment. ECDF would discuss alternative technologies with communities to ensure&#13;
that they are aware of the operation and maintenance requirements and recurrent costs&#13;
implications of the schemes they select. ECDF would also assist the communities to&#13;
establish appropriate user charges, and establish sound financial practices.&#13;
3.29  A key element for the success of this component is capacity building support for&#13;
communities. This would help to ensure that communities not only participate in&#13;
identification of sub-projects, but also have the required skills to operate, maintain and&#13;
manage their water supply in the long term. Technical capacity within the Government&#13;
would also need to be strengthened to facilitate technical assistance, training, and the&#13;
implementation of community awareness creation programs. Efforts would be made to&#13;
ensure that gender concerns are adequately addressed by the capacity building program.&#13;
Private sector capacity would be strengthened through a series of seminars and courses.&#13;
3.30  Feeder Road Rehabilitation. The overall aim of this component is to assist the&#13;
Government to improve access to and from rural communities, markets and social&#13;
services. The proposed improvements will contribute to meet the local transport needs of&#13;
rural communities (including within village needs). The proposed activities would&#13;
include: (i) survey and design of feeder roads, bridges and river crossings; (ii)&#13;
rehabilitation and spot improvements of up to 1270 km of feeder roads; (iii) construction&#13;
of small bridges, culverts and fords or river crossings (an estimated 1 10 box culverts, and&#13;
120 ford or river crossings); (iv) construction of retaining walls and other types of&#13;
environmental protection measures for all types of RRT (Rural Road Transport)&#13;
improvements; (v) strengthening of ECDF Management Office and Regional Branches,&#13;
and of regional administrations through recruitment and training of staff for&#13;
programming, survey and design of feeder roads, and supervision of works; and, (vi)&#13;
training for representatives from beneficiary communities to use guidelines and systems&#13;
to plan, manage, maintain, and make proper use of RRT improvements.&#13;
3.31   The ECDF would provide support to the following types of rural road transport&#13;
improvements: (i) seasonal vehicular access tracks (through spot improvements), e.g. for&#13;
agricultural purposes; (ii) local all-weather vehicular access roads and tracks (including&#13;
within villages roads, and associated drainage and safety measures), which may or may&#13;
not meet rural roads standards; (iii) rural roads of district significance (e.g., major rural&#13;
roads serving groups of communities and important district/woreda administrative&#13;
centers); (iv) a few selected rural roads of regional significance (roads which are links in&#13;
the regional rural road networks); (v) environmentally sound and safe community&#13;
footpaths and pack animal trails; and, (vi) low-cost tracks for appropriate intermediate&#13;
means of transport (IMTs), such as animal-drawn carts, hand carts, and bicycle-based&#13;
transporters. In addition, the ECDF's support to the creation of local micro-credit&#13;
institutions would make resources available for the introduction of IMTs, and local&#13;
transport services. The support would go to entrepreneurs wishing to engage in the local&#13;
manufacture, marketing and operation of affordable IMTs and other local transport.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
3.32  Existing engineering capability in the MOLG resides with the Engineering Unit of&#13;
the ECDF Management Office. The Unit therefore provides a main nucleus for feeder&#13;
roads program coordination in association with the Planning Department of the Ministry.&#13;
The ECDF therefore provides an important vehicle for the MOLG to develop its future&#13;
feeder roads strategy in association with the Regional Administrations and Community&#13;
Baitos and Development Committees. An engineer will be assigned full time to manage&#13;
the program within the ECDF Management Office. The ECDF will then assist in&#13;
establishing the engineering capacity in the regional administrations for the supervision&#13;
and management of future feeder road rehabilitation and maintenance programs&#13;
3.33   Surveys and design of all the roads and structures would be carried out in the first&#13;
two years of activity. Some road rehabilitation, culvert and river construction would start&#13;
in the first year. The project team would review the annual program of roadworks at the&#13;
end of each year to establish the scope of works for the next financial year. Ad hoc cost&#13;
recovery arrangements are already on-going in some regions, including the charging of&#13;
tolls for the use of the roads, and they provide experiences to build upon in ECDF&#13;
financed projects.&#13;
3.34  Soil, Water and Forestry Conservation. ECDF would adopt an integrated&#13;
approach to soil, water and forestry conservation, in line with the on-going Government&#13;
policy. This extended menu of options would include hillside closure and natural&#13;
revegetation, the construction of simple stone or soil bunds, planting of grass strips (e.g.&#13;
with vetiver glass) along the contour, trash lines, retention of crop residues to improve&#13;
ground cover, retention of dung to enhance fertility, minimum tillage, etc. Similarly, the&#13;
frequent prescription of eucalyptus planting to combat deforestation would be enriched&#13;
with the provision of indigenous species, fruit trees which can play an important&#13;
nutritional role, and generally receive a high level of protection by villagers, fodder trees&#13;
that can enhance livestock feeding, and leguminous trees.&#13;
2. Pilot Savings and Credit Program&#13;
3.35  Objective. The Project will also support the launching of a pilot Savings and&#13;
Credit (S&amp;C) program aimed at supporting investment in economic activities at the&#13;
village (or town) level. The program's objective will be to demonstrate the effectiveness&#13;
of institution-building efforts aimed at creating new income and employment&#13;
opportunities in targeted communities, and at contributing to the improvement of living&#13;
standards and to increased overall prosperity of these communities.&#13;
3.36 Approach and Methodology. This objective will be pursued through the&#13;
provision of savings and credit services to substantial numbers of Eritreans in pilot areas.&#13;
Credit will be provided incrementally to individuals who have first demonstrated a&#13;
minimum capacity to save for at least three months. These individuals will then become&#13;
eligible for credit to finance various economic activities in the community. However,&#13;
they will be asked to get together into groups that will operate according to the solidarity&#13;
group concept which has proven successful in other programs around the world (each&#13;
group member is responsible for the repayment of loans extended to other members of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
group--all group members will be denied access to further credit until all loans to group&#13;
members have been repaid). These groups will then be supported and supervised by&#13;
village-level community-based organizations, as described below (see Annex M for a&#13;
detailed description of the basic village banking model adopted by the program).&#13;
3.37   Group members will be eligible, subject to approval of loan purpose by other&#13;
group members and by the Baito S&amp;C Sub-Committee responsible for program activities,&#13;
to small loans initially of up to Birr 750 (approximately US $100) typically repayable&#13;
over six months. The loan amounts could be increased to Birr 6,000 repayable over two&#13;
years, depending on a successful repayment record. In order to take full opportunity of&#13;
income-generating and employment-creation opportunities in program areas, the program&#13;
will also fund a limited number of larger small enterprises either individually- or&#13;
collectively-owned operating in these areas. These second-tier loans, which will range&#13;
from Birr 10,000 to Birr 100,000, will require completion of a formal feasibility study&#13;
and also require approval by ECDF's centrally-based S&amp;C Unit. They will finance sub-&#13;
projects providing benefits to the entire community (irrigation pumps, oil extraction&#13;
presses, grain mills, food processing installation), or businesses able to generate&#13;
employment at the community level (carpentry shops, tailoring operations). These loans&#13;
will provide added flexibility to the S&amp;C program, by filling gaps in availability of&#13;
financing for larger somewhat more formalized ventures which would still have no access&#13;
to commercial bank credit.&#13;
3.38   Management of Program at Village Level. The program will cover, during its&#13;
first two years, three village clusters situated in separate regions of the country, to be&#13;
extended to three additional clusters starting in Year 3. At first level of management, the&#13;
program will rely on village Administrations or other institutions (selected on the basis of&#13;
eligibility criteria included in the Operational Manual) that would offer adequate capacity&#13;
to oversee the creation and operation of borrower groups and manage savings and credit&#13;
activities--including savings deposits and withdrawals, and loan disbursements and&#13;
collection.. For program purposes, village Administrations will establish three-person&#13;
Savings and Credit (S&amp;C) Sub-Committees (to include the village Administration&#13;
Chairman) directly responsible for program implementation. At least one member of the&#13;
Sub-Committee will be a woman.'&#13;
3.39 Regional-Level Management. ECDF will assign one S&amp;C officer to each&#13;
regional cluster during the first year of operation in that cluster, plus, as required, an S&amp;C&#13;
agent during the second year, as well as a second S&amp;C agent during the third year. S&amp;C&#13;
officers and agents will be responsible for overall program activities in their region,&#13;
working hand-in-hand with village Administration Sub-Committees to establish, train and&#13;
supervise borrower groups. They will also closely monitor the administrative and&#13;
financial functions performed by these Sub-Committees (particularly with respect to loan&#13;
collection), while acting as liaison with head office. These field staff will play a critical&#13;
role in preserving the program's operational and financial integrity, and will be subject to&#13;
Other measures to ensure strong participation of women will include the taking into account of a field&#13;
officer's success in reaching women as part of his/her evaluation criteria.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
strict performance evaluations based on expansion and performance of the program in&#13;
their area (key evaluation criteria will include collection performance, as well as number&#13;
of village banks created, number of new members, number of loans extended, and share&#13;
of loans benefiting women).&#13;
3.40   Central-Level Management. The program will rely at the central level on a&#13;
Savings and Credit Unit to be established within ECDF. The Unit will provide overall&#13;
guidance for the program, carry out program-wide activities such as establishment of a&#13;
management information system (the detailed outline of which was agreed upon during&#13;
appraisal) and selection and training of field staff. It will also supervise and monitor&#13;
field-based activities. The Government is fully aware of the importance of maintaining&#13;
from the very start of the program the highest standards of administrative and financial&#13;
performance, and of selecting a top-quality program manager to help enforce such&#13;
standards. An overall program outline and a detailed operational manual were developed&#13;
during project appraisal and agreed upon at that time with ECDF management.&#13;
3.41   Contribution to Financial Markets Development. Eritrea's financial system is&#13;
still in its infancy. Although the country's National Bank is organizing itself to play&#13;
some of the core functions of a central bank, Eritrea still uses the Ethiopian Birr as its&#13;
currenicy, and, since it does not issue its own currency, has little control over its monetary&#13;
policy. The state-owned Commercial Bank of Eritrea remains the only commercial bank&#13;
in operation, reaching only a fraction of the country's population. Only a few scattered&#13;
NGO-sponsored savings and credit programs are presently offering financial services to a&#13;
few thousand amongst the vast majority of the population with little or no access to&#13;
formal banking services.&#13;
3.42  In this context, the pilot S&amp;C program can gradually contribute to the broadening&#13;
of Eritrea's financial system. Although its initial outreach will be limited (270 rural and&#13;
urban sites and 13,500 beneficiaries reached after Year 5), it will, if successful, constitute&#13;
the basis for a viable institutional framework for the extension of savings and credit&#13;
services to economic agents heretofore totally excluded from participation in formalized&#13;
financial transactions. Also, the program will rely on an institutional mechanism (the&#13;
Village Administration Sub-Committee) which offers strong potential for the&#13;
establishment and growth of a community-based system oriented towards the rural- and&#13;
urban-based micro-entrepreneur. Finally, the program will adopt a structure of interest&#13;
rates fully consistent with long-term development of Eritrea's financial markets,&#13;
sufficient to compensate for: (a) erosion of the fund through inflation; (b) cost of&#13;
administration at the level of ECDF; and, (c) anticipated losses tied to bad debts. The&#13;
village administrations or other FIs will on-lend to final beneficiaries at commercial rates.&#13;
ECDF and IDA will review anmually the interest rate applied from ECDF to the financial&#13;
intermediaries, and the plan for the next year of activity.&#13;
3. Capacity Building, Training, and Research&#13;
3.43   During the pilot phase, the Fund had limited resources for capacity building.&#13;
Given the increased volume of activity in the expanded ECDF, the Project would include&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
a practical and targeted training program designed to ensure effective implementation of&#13;
Fund activities. Capacity building would help ensure that the Fund is appropriately&#13;
decentralized, community based, and that the communities would play a primary role not&#13;
only in the identification of sub-projects, but also in their implementation and monitoring,&#13;
and the subsequent maintenance of facilities. Capacity building would target professional&#13;
personnel in the Fund at the Central and Regional level; personnel in line ministries&#13;
supporting Fund activities; facilitators assisting the ECDF in project promotion and&#13;
implementation; and beneficiary communities and community leaders who would both&#13;
have to contribute to the development of the project and utilize and maintain the assets&#13;
built with ECDF financing. A promotion and Training Officer will be located in the MO&#13;
to manage and coordinate all training and capacity building activities.&#13;
3.44  Capacity building activities for the expanded ECDF would be financed by a&#13;
parallel program sponsored by a consortium of donors, which would start before the&#13;
beginning of the expanded ECDF. The capacity building program would include among&#13;
the activities necessary to prepare the expanded ECDF, the drawing up of a roster of&#13;
national resources (government agencies, NGOs, individual consultants, or consulting&#13;
firms) which can be used to provide the necessary training or technical assistance. The&#13;
capacity building program would rely on Eritrean organizations and experts (selected&#13;
through a process of competitive bidding), supplemented, where needed, by international&#13;
specialists working under the supervision of ECDF. The approach would reflect the goal&#13;
of strengthening local capacity, and emphasis would be given to training of trainers. Final&#13;
agreement on the approach, content, and strategy for the capacity building programn has&#13;
been reached at Appraisal, and is reflected in the Capacity Building Support Program&#13;
document, available in the Project file.&#13;
3.45 The capacity building program would also include a research fund that would be&#13;
used primarily to assess the real benefits of the ECDF from a community point-of view,&#13;
and to ensure the necessary levels of quality in sub-project design and maintenance.&#13;
3.46  The pilot experience has identified some broad parameters and some specific&#13;
areas to which the capacity building program would need to respond, although a needs&#13;
analysis has been planned to identify the details of the program for the five year period of&#13;
the Project. Three broad areas have been prioritized. Firstly, organizational strengthening&#13;
and training activities would be provided to the management and professional personnel&#13;
of the ECDF in the Management Office and Regional Branches. A second target for&#13;
training would be the various facilitators assisting the ECDF and communities with sub-&#13;
project design and implementation. These include local sector specialists and&#13;
development officers located at regional and district level in the Reconstruction and&#13;
Development Divisions (RDD) of Local Government. A third target would be&#13;
community committees and beneficiary groups, with training focused on project design,&#13;
implementation, and supervision, and the maintenance of infrastructure.&#13;
3.47  Approaches to Capacity Building. The capacity building component would&#13;
give emphasis to team building, to enable the ECDF to accomplish its goals with a small&#13;
number of staff and facilitators. Training methods would focus on group problem solving&#13;
and group decision making, and strengthening the links among the ECDF Management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
Office and Regional Branches, local government, and the communities. The training&#13;
would aim for a blend of building upon the realities of Eritrean conditions, and learning&#13;
from the best of outside experience and specialized techniques. In areas of technical&#13;
complexity, especially in the early years of the Project, training would be supplemented&#13;
by technical assistance from experienced experts, who would provide a combination of&#13;
training on-the-job, and consulting supervision at the actual construction sites. To widen&#13;
the experience of ECDF staff, selective use would be made of out-of-country study tours&#13;
and courses.&#13;
3.48  The program would support the identification and training of community&#13;
facilitators that can maintain a link between the communities and ECDF. Training&#13;
activities would be flexible and integrated and consist of a combinations of workshops,&#13;
and seminars, on the job and on site support, formal training, and overseas courses and&#13;
study tours. To strengthen its management approach training would be combined with&#13;
organizational development methods. Capacity building at the community level, would&#13;
make use of traditional village meetings and committee structures, supported by special&#13;
workshops, the distribution of promotional materials, and use of mass media.&#13;
3.49  Capacity Building for the ECDF Staff Based on the pilot experience, the major&#13;
capacity building priority for the ECDF itself will be the training of new project officers&#13;
in the Fund's sub-project cycle: identification, preparation and appraisal, and&#13;
implementation and supervision. At both Management Office and Regional Branches&#13;
levels, the ECDF would strengthen its organizational capacity to handle the increased&#13;
volume of activity the expanded program would generate, and to assist the gradual and&#13;
incremental process of decentralization of responsibilities to Regional Branches. Specific&#13;
measures include the use of a Monitoring and Information System (MIS), the use of&#13;
strategic planning methods in developing the Fund's program, and a rigorous financial&#13;
management and reporting system. Special training would also be required to support the&#13;
program of promotion and community development.&#13;
3.50  Technical Assistance and Technical Training. Most of the capacity building&#13;
efforts would focus on technical support for both Fund staff, facilitators, and local&#13;
communities. This would involve both training activities, the development of a system of&#13;
monitoring and physical inspection, and on site visitation by technical experts. Particular&#13;
attention would be paid to the areas of water supply and rural road rehabilitation, where&#13;
maintenance is a major responsibility of communities and local authorities. A complete&#13;
set of training and capacity building activities has been designed to make possible the&#13;
implementation of the pilot Savings and Credit component, and is included in the&#13;
Capacity Building Support Document.&#13;
3.51  Capacity Building for Facilitators of Sub-Project Implementation. Local&#13;
experts and administration officials would play an important role in supporting ECDF&#13;
activities, by helping ensure that ECDF sub-projects meet sectoral standards, by&#13;
providing technical support in design and supervision, and by assisting the ECDF staff in&#13;
promotion and community development activities. Where needed, the capacity building&#13;
component would train these facilitators in the Fund's procedures and processes, and in&#13;
the management of community-based projects. Special tailor-made programs would also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
be organized for district and regional officials in sector-specific aspects of ECDF&#13;
financed activities.&#13;
3.52   Capacity Building at the Community Level. The overall goal of the capacity-&#13;
building program at the community level, is to assist communities to take the lead in&#13;
utilizing the opportunities offered by the ECDF, through a realistic blend of strengthened&#13;
self-reliance, and the ability to assess the need for expertise to be contracted outside. The&#13;
first level of capacity building for communities would focus on training community&#13;
beneficiaries in the approaches and procedures of the Fund, methods of identifying sub-&#13;
projects of benefit to the community, methods of monitoring implementation progress&#13;
and evaluating outcomes, and the skills to ensure effective community maintenance of&#13;
assets. The second level would be training for community leaders and community project&#13;
committees in managing the community's interests in the project cycle, including&#13;
negotiating with Fund staff and facilitators, and contracting implementation services.&#13;
Training would also cover basic skills in managing finances and supervising work in&#13;
progress. The third level would be specialized programs that cover a particular theme&#13;
(such as environmental conservation, the needs of poor women or other special groups,&#13;
the use of community labor, the essential linkages among sectoral activities); or provide a&#13;
specialized skill (for example, training in the use of a particular type of technology or&#13;
equipment).&#13;
E. RECURRENT COSTs GENERATED BY SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE&#13;
SUB-PROJECTS&#13;
3.53   The following tables provide estimates of the recurrent costs implications of the&#13;
proposed project on the Government's budget. It is important to note that the projections&#13;
are made on an assumed pattern of expansion of different facilities; in fact the community&#13;
may demand a different mix of projects. Calculating the recurrent cost is done by sector.&#13;
The assumption is that the project activities in each of the three sectors are of an&#13;
investment nature, recurrent costs are calculated starting the first year of completion of&#13;
investment in each of the sectors. The budgetary impact is likely to be lower than&#13;
estimated here because communities are expected to make contributions to the&#13;
maintenance and recurrent costs of projects. In primary education, although no tuition&#13;
fees are charged, parents bear the costs of maintenance of schools; in future, they may be&#13;
expected to finance a larger share of recurrent costs, for example by paying a charge for&#13;
textbooks. In the health sector there is presently a symbolic fee charged for services&#13;
delivered at the health stations and centers, but there is an active dialogue in the&#13;
Government about a significant increase in the user charge fee structure. For the rural&#13;
water supply component, recurrent costs will be fully covered by the beneficiary&#13;
communities; and no recurrent costs are anticipated for the pilot savings and credit&#13;
program.&#13;
3.54   Education. The project envisages an investment outlay totaling US$ 8.92 million&#13;
over five years, distributed as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
Table 2 Investments in Education Sub-Projects ('000 US$)&#13;

3.55   To calculate the recurrent expenditure associated with the investments above, we&#13;
use government estimates. For a primary school, it estimated that the capital cost per&#13;
class room including furniture is 79,396 Birr. Assuming 41 students per class room and&#13;
double shift, the capital cost per pupil is 945 Birr. It is also estimated that the recurrent&#13;
cost (desirable, not actual) per pupil would be 117 Birr. This implies that the ratio of&#13;
recurrent to capital cost is 117/945 = 12.4%. Similarly, the ratio for a secondary school is&#13;
to be estimated at 142/906 = 15.7%.&#13;
3.56   The investment outlays in Table 2 above produce the following cumulative&#13;
recurrent costs in constant dollars:&#13;
Table 3 Cumulative Recurrent Costs in Education Sub-Projects ('000 US$)&#13;
Year 1   Year 2   Year 3   Year 4   Year 5 &amp; Beyond&#13;

3.57   Thus, at the completion of this project component, after 5 years, 10.4 million Birr&#13;
(at current exchange rate) would need to be allocated, or partially raised and the rest&#13;
allocated in the budget to ensure sustainability of the above investment.&#13;
3.58   Health. A similar exercise is carried out for the health component. The project&#13;
outlays for the health sector are as follows:&#13;
Table 4 Investment Costs in Health Sub-Projects (000 US$)&#13;
Year 1    Year 2    Year 3    Year 4    Year 5&#13;
Total Project Outlay    1,000     1,834     1,438     1,036       500&#13;

Veterinary Clinic        126       343        185       185        76&#13;
3.59   Assuming a standard capital cost per health station of US $60,000 or 378,000 Birr&#13;
at current exchange rate, and a recurrent cost per HS of 104,040 Birr; the recurrent/capital&#13;
cost ratio is 27.5% Similarly, for Health centers, the respective numbers are US $250,000&#13;
or 1,575,000 Birr at current exchange rate, and 217,050 Birr. The ratio of recurrent to&#13;
capital is 13.8%. There are no estimates available for Vet Clinics, and thus a ratio of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
13.8% is also used here. On such basis, the cumulative recurrent costs associated with the&#13;
investment outlays for the sectors are projected below:&#13;
Table 5 Cumulative Recurrent Costs in Health Sub-Projects&#13;

Total (000 Birr) @ 6.3       1,310    3,943     6,017    7,384     8,184&#13;
Total includ. markup for drugs  1,507    4,534  5,232    8,492     9,412&#13;
3.60   Upon the completion of this component of the project, therefore, 8.2 million Birr&#13;
(at current exchange rate) would need to be budgeted to ensure the sustainability of the&#13;
investment. Including the cost of drugs provided, 9.4 million Birr would have to be&#13;
budgeted.&#13;
3.61   Rural Feeder Roads. The assumption here is that the project is financing the&#13;
construction of rural roads, using mainly labor-based technology. The component&#13;
allocates US $16.5 million including spot improvements, rehabilitation and survey and&#13;
design of 1052 km of roads, over the 5 years as follows:&#13;
Table 6 Projection of Road Sub-Projects (US$ '000)&#13;
Year 1   Year 2    Year 3    Year 4    Year 5&#13;
Project Outlay     3,113    3,892     3,365    4,019     2,146&#13;

3.62   The average rehabilitation cost is estimated at US $13,000 per kilometer of rural&#13;
roads including survey and design. The project would finance the improvement and&#13;
construction of 1272 km of roads as shown in Table 6 above. Also, assuming a cost for&#13;
routine maintenance (mainly by labor-based methods) of US $600 per km and an&#13;
equivalent cost from periodic maintenance (once every 5 years), the total cumulative&#13;
maintenance cost associated with the project would be:&#13;
Table 7 Maintenance Costs of Road Sub-Projects&#13;
Yrl      Yr2       Yr3      Yr4       Yr5    Yr6&amp;Beyond&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
3.63  Thus, by the time of project completion, 4.8 million Birr needs to be allocated or&#13;
raised to ensure sustainability of the road component.&#13;
3.64 Budgetary Impact. Assuming that there is no community contribution nor donor&#13;
financing for the recurrent costs associated with the three project components above, the&#13;
budgetary impact after project completion will total 23.4 million Birr (10.4m + 8.2m&#13;
+4.8m). The annual budgetary impact would be:&#13;
Table 8 Budgetary Impact&#13;

Budgetary Impact      2.3     9.1       14.5    19.7        23.4&#13;

as a% Recurrent Budget   0.16  0.48     0.74     1.05        1.2&#13;
3.65  Thus, the annual budgetary impact compared to the FY94 budget, reportedly at&#13;
1,867 million Birr, would be insignificant. Even if the budget remains constant at the&#13;
FY94 level, the highest budgetary impact in year 5 and beyond will still amount to only&#13;
1.2% of annual recurrent expenditure.&#13;
F. MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (MIS) AND REPORTING&#13;
3.66  The ECDF Management Information System will track the physical and financial&#13;
progress of sub-project activities and the financial commitments and expenditure of the&#13;
Fund, and provide the information for monthly, quarterly, and annual reports. The MIS&#13;
will also store information to respond to ad-hoc queries, and to carry out periodic&#13;
assessments of the impact of ECDF activities on beneficiaries. During the pilot phase,&#13;
the ECDF moved from a manual accounting system to a computerized system, which is&#13;
being further upgraded to a Windows-based package. In parallel with the accounting&#13;
system, the Project is also establishing a fully computerized Management Information&#13;
System (MIS) to report on sub-project implementation progress. The system is&#13;
centralized with networked microcomputers for each of the Management Office&#13;
functions. Some MIS functions, including sub-project data entry and monitoring, will be&#13;
progressively transferred to the Regional branches as they build their own computing and&#13;
staff capabilities. The final phase of MIS development is currently being implemented,&#13;
and the full automated and integrated MIS and accounting systems will be operational by&#13;
Project Effectiveness. In the period before the project becomes effective, the accounting&#13;
and MIS procedures (as described in Annex C), will be fully tested, and sample formal&#13;
outputs, including reporting formats and monitoring indicators, will be generated,&#13;
reviewed and finalized. Approval by IDA of the output formats will be a condition of&#13;
project effectiveness.&#13;
3.67 Regular Reporting System. Monthly and Quarterly Progress and Financial&#13;
Reports will be the main tools for monitoring progress of the ECDF activities. The&#13;
essential components of these reports will be: (i) progress with reference to the Annual&#13;
Plan; (ii) summary of the progress of sub-projects under preparation since the previous&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
report; (iii) summary of sub-projects under implementation, identifying time and cost&#13;
performance and encountered problems; (iv) summary of sub-projects completed since&#13;
the previous report, analyzing time and cost performance and reporting on encountered&#13;
problems; (v) financial and administration reports, which will include monthly operating&#13;
statements comparing real costs to those budgeted on a monthly and a cumulative basis,&#13;
overall, by region and by project, giving reasons for any material over-runs or savings;&#13;
and (vi) a running report on capital and recurrent costs for each type of infrastructure and&#13;
service introduced through the ECDF, and an analysis of the sources of financing for each&#13;
(the ECDF, Ministries and provincial departments, and communities). At the end of each&#13;
year an Annual Progress Report will be prepared which will be used as the basis for&#13;
formulating the Annual Work Program for the forthcoming year. In addition to providing&#13;
a review of financial and fiscal performance, the report will also include a summary of&#13;
impact assessments completed since the previous report with a synopsis of the findings,&#13;
including special attention to environmental impact. A detailed description of the design&#13;
of the MIS, including the MIS for the pilot Savings and Credit program is provided in&#13;
Annex C. In addition to regular monitoring activities, the ECDF will carry out periodic&#13;
topic-specific evaluations of its operations, including beneficiary assessments.&#13;
3.68  Sub-Project Completion Reports. Whenever an ECDF sub-project has been&#13;
completed, the Project Officer responsible will carry out an assessment and produce a&#13;
Sub-Project Completion Report. This will include: (i) a summary of the physical&#13;
achievements and outcomes based on the agreed sub-project goals; (ii) a statement of the&#13;
benefits as seen at this stage; (iii) a statement of specific problems encountered and&#13;
actions taken to remedy them; (iv) a summary of project accounts; and, (v) a description&#13;
of follow-up steps, including maintenance arrangements and responsibilities. Six months&#13;
after project completion, projects will be revisited and project performance will be rated&#13;
on the basis of technical performance, extent of utilization by intended beneficiaries, and&#13;
by commitment by community and by cooperating agency to their obligations.&#13;
3.69  Mid-Term Evaluation. A mid-term evaluation of the ECDF, carried out by&#13;
independent specialists, will take place after 30 months of implementation to: (i)&#13;
determine whether satisfactory progress is being made towards meeting the Project&#13;
objectives; (ii) evaluate the impact of the sub-projects on beneficiaries; (iii) assess the&#13;
technical quality of construction; (iv) assess whether arrangements for recurrent costs and&#13;
the maintenance of assets built with Fund support are being honored, and analyze the&#13;
sources for the financing of recurrent costs ; and, (v) determine whether there is a need to&#13;
modify any practices. The mid-term evaluators will review a representative sample of&#13;
sub-projects, and interview community committee members/ beneficiaries, local&#13;
government officials, and Fund staff. Beneficiaries will participate in impact studies to&#13;
assess the change in their economic and social welfare as a result of the facilities and&#13;
services provided through ECDF financing. Special emphasis will be given to issues&#13;
relating to gender, environment, and sustainability.&#13;
3.70 Implementation Completion Report. An Implementation Completion Report&#13;
(ICR) will be prepared jointly by the Government and IDA within six months of the end&#13;
of the ECDF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
3.71  Annual Work Plan and Budget. The Regional Branches will be responsible for&#13;
maintaining a pipeline of sub-project proposals submitted by communities and screened&#13;
as eligible. This pipeline will be reviewed with the regional administration and sector&#13;
departments. The pipeline will then be used to develop the Annual Work Plan and&#13;
Budget (AWPB) for ECDF's activities in the region. The rationale for the volume of&#13;
activities included in the AWPB will be based on a number of factors as reflected in the&#13;
Annual Progress Report, and these will be specifically analyzed in the AWPB which will&#13;
contain: (i) the project processing achievements of the previous year; (ii) the average&#13;
implementation time taken for each category of project; (iii) the ECDF work-load&#13;
requirements for each category of project; (iv) disbursement performance; and (v) the&#13;
satisfactory provision of financing to cover recurrent costs. Where the AWPB proposes a&#13;
higher volume of activity than would be justified on the basis of the previous year's&#13;
performance, the reasons will need to be stated. The AWPB will also include an analysis&#13;
of the rationale for the content of the activities proposed, including: (i) responsiveness to&#13;
priority community needs; (ii) level of community commitment and anticipated&#13;
investment; (iii) level of priority in sector terms, and consistency with sector policy for&#13;
the region; (iv) distribution over communities in the region; and, (v) responsiveness to&#13;
needs of poor and vulnerable groups, especially women. In addition to these analyses,&#13;
the AWPB will include a summary presentation of all pipeline proposals, the expected&#13;
costs to the ECDF, the recurrent cost implications (worked out with the counterpart sector&#13;
ministries and based on information gathered through the Community Contribution&#13;
Monitoring System on the level of community contributions to recurrent costs), the&#13;
anticipated disbursement schedule, and the overhead staffing/administrative/operational&#13;
costs linked to the volume of activities proposed. The AWPB will be submitted for&#13;
review and approval by the Ministry of Finance, the Budget and Management Office in&#13;
the Office of the President, and IDA and other participating donors. The adoption of the&#13;
consolidated and regional budgetfor the first year of ECDF operations acceptable to&#13;
IDA will be a condition for project effectiveness.&#13;
G. LEGAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
3.72  ECDF has been established by a government directive as an autonomous entity&#13;
functioning within the Ministry of Local Government, headed by a General Manager&#13;
appointed by the Government. This will permit ECDF to function autonomously with&#13;
direct access to IDA funds and operate according to procedural guidelines stated in its&#13;
Operational Manual. At the same time, this arrangement will encourage a sense of&#13;
ownership and commitment in the regions by placing the ECDF within the local&#13;
government system. The draft directive to establish ECDF was agreed upon during&#13;
Negotiations; and the ECDF has been officially established in January 1996.&#13;
3.73  An Operational Manual has been prepared based on the experience gained in the&#13;
pilot phase to guide ECDF activities at the central and regional levels. It has been&#13;
finalized and agreed upon during Negotiations and adopted in January 1996. This&#13;
Manual provides criteria for appraisal and selection of sub-projects, including the pilot&#13;
Savings and Credit component, establishes reporting and monitoring obligations at the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
central and regional levels, and details procurement and disbursement procedures, and&#13;
once finalized, will be amended only in consultation with IDA.&#13;
3.74  ECDF will enter into financing and implementation agreements with the&#13;
community or village level entities. The practice followed during the pilot will be&#13;
continued during the expanded program: ECDF will sign "Financing Agreements" with&#13;
Village Administrations, which are established at the village and district levels by&#13;
Regulation of the Ministry of Local Government to ensure people's participation in the&#13;
development process through the encouragement of local initiatives. The Regulation&#13;
confers authority on these committees to enter into contracts and receive public funds. In&#13;
the pilot Savings and Credit program ECDF will sign with Village Administrations or&#13;
other financial intermediaries a Financing Agreement before opening any line of credit.&#13;
H. ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS&#13;
3.75  The Government aims to ensure that no sub-project will have a negative impact&#13;
on the environment. The appraisal process for each sub-project is designed to ensure that&#13;
any potential negative environmental impact will be identified at an early stage and&#13;
discussed with the community to reach an agreement on appropriate mitigating actions.&#13;
Where no solution can be found, the sub-project will not be further processed.&#13;
3.76  It is anticipated that most ECDF sub-projects are unlikely to have any adverse&#13;
impact on the environment. As the roads component of the project will consist almost&#13;
exclusively of the rehabilitation or upgrading of existing feeder roads and footpaths, no&#13;
major environmental issues are envisaged for this component. However, attention will&#13;
need to be paid to preventing potential erosion of slopes bordering rural roads financed&#13;
under the project. As most of the potential environmental problems that are likely to&#13;
occur can be dealt with through special features of project design, close monitoring and&#13;
technical support to communities, the project has a limited potential for environmental&#13;
harm. Thus the project has been rated category B.&#13;
3.77  The Fund also anticipates receiving requests for a number of proposals with&#13;
potentially positive environmental impacts, such as the establishment of tree nurseries&#13;
and woodlots for communal and individual use, the provision of tree seedlings for&#13;
fuelwood, fruit and construction material, the planting of fodder grasses, fertilizer and&#13;
seed to enhance hillside closures, construction of grasstrips, bunding, terracing, drainage&#13;
ditches, check-dams to control run-off, and measures for gully stabilization. A guiding&#13;
principle will be that such measures should be based on a clear commitment by the&#13;
community and individuals concerned, to maintain such investment without further&#13;
incentives through food or cash.&#13;
3.78  ECDF staff will receive training in order to enable them to identify potential&#13;
environmental issues and to take appropriate action to ensure that these can be avoided or&#13;
minimized. The Project Officers will be assisted in their sub-project design, appraisal and&#13;
supervision by a series of sector-specific environmental check-lists as part of an&#13;
environmental assessment handbook. Agreement on the terms of reference for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
handbook, including content of the environmental checklists for each sub-sector, has been&#13;
reached at Appraisal. Further details of environmental issues and analysis are contained&#13;
in Annex I&#13;
1. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
3.79   The total cost for the five year project period is US $49.68 million equivalent with&#13;
a foreign exchange cost of US $13.57. The cost projections are based on the pilot&#13;
experience, a review of sector-specific unit costs and projections of the implementation&#13;
load that can be carried by the proposed ECDF staffing levels (ifull details of these&#13;
projections are contained in the project files). Table 9 shows the indicative financing&#13;
plan. The IDA credit of US $17.5 million equivalent will cover about 35 % of the total&#13;
project cost. The Govermment will cover approximately US $7.50 million (15% of the&#13;
total cost) and the communities are expected to cover about US $4.50 million (9% of the&#13;
total project costs). Other donors are expected to finance US $20.12 million (41%).&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
3.80  In addition to covering a large part of the operational costs, the Government's&#13;
contribution will finance: (a) recruitment of ECDF staff; and (b) operation and&#13;
maintenance of ECDF offices.&#13;
J. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.81   ECDF will operate in accordance with detailed procurement procedures specified&#13;
in the Operational Manual which have taken into account the unavailability of contractors&#13;
or construction materials in most of the rural areas and the relatively weak capacity of the&#13;
Regional Branches. Project arrangements for procurement are, therefore, designed to&#13;
enable ECDF to progressively and incrementally delegate procurement responsibility to&#13;
Regional Branches and community groups proportionally with the increase in contracting&#13;
capacity and availability of construction materials. For example, it is anticipated that&#13;
before the end of the first project year, it may be possible to delegate limited procurement&#13;
and contracting responsibilities to the Region I Branch (Asmara), provided necessary&#13;
institutional building activities have been successfully completed.&#13;
3.82  Procurement Management. Procurement will be the responsibility of the&#13;
Logistics Unit in the Management Office, headed by a Logistics Officer. In the regional&#13;
offices, financial officers will be in charge of handling procurement, preparing documents&#13;
for review by the Management Office, and monitoring and supervising procurement&#13;
within their regions. Procurement training for all staff is an important component of the&#13;
capacity building program.&#13;
3.83  The Financing Agreement signed between the Community Project Committee and&#13;
ECDF will specify procurement arrangements for each sub-project. Where Community&#13;
Project Committees do not have institutional capacity to conduct procurement, it will&#13;
either select a suitable intermediary like a voluntary association to act on its behalf or&#13;
authorize the ECDF to do so. In all cases, however, the Community Council will be&#13;
responsible for monitoring and following up procurement of goods, the storage and&#13;
release of goods and materials, supervision of the contractors on a daily basis, and&#13;
management of community contribution.&#13;
3.84  Unit-Costs Data Base. ECDF will maintain both at the central and at the&#13;
regional levels, a data base of unit costs, which will be updated on a quarterly basis, as&#13;
part of the cost control system and to assure that contract selection is transparent and&#13;
economic. The Engineering Unit will establish costs and rates for at least 40 of the most&#13;
commonly required items based on project costs during the previous three months or&#13;
from a random sample of suppliers and employers. Such unit prices will be updated at&#13;
least on a quarterly basis. Unit prices for other required items will be updated on a&#13;
rotational basis so as to be updated at least two times a year. For purposes of collection&#13;
and updating of unit costs, ECDF will make a data base of employers and suppliers from&#13;
whom such unit prices will be collected on a rotational basis. The MIS will use the unit&#13;
prices to calculate compound prices for commonly required items of work. The data base&#13;
will be used in appraisal and monitoring, as a tool to review the project budget in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
Financing Agreement and as a guide when procurement is through direct contracting.&#13;
The establishment of such databases will be a condition for Credit Effectiveness.&#13;
3.85  Civil Works. Civil works contracts are small, ranging mainly from US $ 7,000 to&#13;
US $ 300,000. They are scattered around the country and unlikely to attract international&#13;
contractors. ICB for works is, therefore, not anticipated. Procurement will be done in the&#13;
following way: (i ) civil works contracts, not to exceed US $ 300,000 each, amounting to&#13;
US $15.63 million (IDA: US $ 6.5 m) in aggregate, will be procured through National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB). Bidding documents used for the pilot phase have been&#13;
revised in conformity with Bank Guidelines, (ii) in remote areas, where NCB is not&#13;
practical, works or labor up to an aggregate of US $ 2.79 (IDA: US $ 1.75) . each&#13;
individual contract not to exceed US $ 75,000, will be procured through limited&#13;
competition with contractors selected from a shortlist. Such shortlist will be prepared for&#13;
areas where the ECDF will operate in and the list will be updated on a regular basis; (iii)&#13;
in order to encourage community participation and increase project sustainability, an&#13;
estimated US$ I million in IDA financed contracts (individual contracts not to exceed&#13;
US$ 75,000) will be implemented through self-help projects contracted out to&#13;
community-based agencies such as Community Project Committees. Criteria for&#13;
selection of such implementing agencies will be established in the Operational Manual&#13;
and procurement arrangements will be defined in the financing agreements. The unit cost&#13;
data base will guide the negotiation of the labor components; (iv) given the experience in&#13;
the pilot, in a number of areas, it is difficult to find more than one contractor to execute&#13;
the works. In such cases, direct contracting for works or labor will be permitted up to a&#13;
total of US $2.17 million (IDA: US $ Im), each contract not to exceed US $ 50.000.&#13;
Prices for such contracts will be negotiated on the basis of the unit rates database, and (v)&#13;
the Government has stressed the need to use Force Account to implement sub-projects in&#13;
remote areas where neither contractors nor communities are capable of undertaking&#13;
implementation. This will mostly be in the case of sub-projects in the road sector, and is&#13;
estimated to amount to US $3.61 million, with IDA financing a total of US $0.75 million.&#13;
In such cases, it is expected that the Fund will request the local government bureau in the&#13;
locality to provide the labor and technical assistance, while the community or ECDF will&#13;
provide the construction materials. Each individual contract will not exceed US&#13;
$200,000. The Government and IDA have agreed on a list of areas and regions were&#13;
Force Account will be allowed during Negotiations.&#13;

Includes US$ I million through self-help projects contracted out to community based agencies such as&#13;
private voluntary organizations or Community Project Committees.&#13;
3.86   Goods and Materials will be procured according to the following procedures: (i)&#13;
vehicles and office equipment, totaling up to US $1 million (IDA US$ 1.00 million), will&#13;
be procured through International Competitive Bidding; (ii) given the nature of the ECDF&#13;
activities, other contracts for goods are small and scattered, and are not expected to&#13;
exceed US $50,000 per contract. This procurement will therefore be conducted through a&#13;
formalized form of National Shopping up to an aggregate of US $ 12.23 million (IDA:&#13;
US$ 4.00 million). A computerized data base of all suppliers of goods and construction&#13;
materials commonly used by the ECDF will be maintained both at the central and sub-&#13;
unit levels. Price quotations will be solicited from all suppliers listed, and in no case from&#13;
less than three suppliers. The Evaluation Committee will review the price quotations&#13;
received from the suppliers and issue the final award; and (iii) where it is not possible to&#13;
get a minimum of three quotations or where small amounts of materials or goods are&#13;
required, goods or materials will be procured through direct contracting procedures up to&#13;
an aggregate of US $3.05 million (IDA: US $ 0.5 million), with each individual contract&#13;
not to exceed US $ 15,000.&#13;
3.87   Consultant Services. Consultant service contracts will be awarded in accordance&#13;
with World Bank Guidelines, "Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the&#13;
World Bank as Executing Agency" (Washington D.C., August 1981) which has been&#13;
included in the Operational Manual. These will be mainly small contracts for the training&#13;
of ECDF staff, community participants, and the staff of other agencies involved in&#13;
implementation of sub-projects. These contracts are expected to total US $1.75 million,&#13;
spread over a period of five years and a substantial proportion of this will be procured&#13;
locally. It is estimated that US$ 0.5 million will be financed by IDA.&#13;
3.88   Prior review combined with financial audits and technical reviews will ensure that&#13;
procurement is in compliance with agreed procedures. All ICB contracts and all contracts&#13;
above US$ 200,000 will be subject to the Bank's prior review procedures. Other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
contracts and bids will be subject to selective ex-post review by Bank staff during regular&#13;
supervision missions. All contracts for consultancy and training services estimated to&#13;
cost above the equivalent of US $50,000 in the case of consulting firms, and US$ 25,000&#13;
in the case of individuals, will require prior review by IDA. All single source&#13;
consultancy or training contracts, regardless of their value, will be subject to prior&#13;
review. A technical review of all procurement will be condlucted 12 months after&#13;
effectiveness to evaluate the economy and efficiency of procurement arrangements and&#13;
the suitability of the procurement arrangements will be reviewed. A draft terms of&#13;
reference has been agreed upon between the Government and IDA during Negotiations.&#13;
3.89   All contracts will be available for Bank review on request and for supervision&#13;
missions. In addition, the Management Office will also maintain and have available for&#13;
IDA supervision missions, copies of appraisal reports for all sub-projects. A Procurement&#13;
Plan has been finalized and agreed upon during Negotiations. The procurement&#13;
arrangements for the project is provided in Table 11 above.&#13;
3.90   Pilot Savings &amp; Credit Program. Micro-credit sub-projects will involve&#13;
procurement of small goods and services each estimated not to cost more than (US$&#13;
15,000). They will be procured in accordance with established private sector-commercial&#13;
practices. The micro-credit component is estimated to be US $ 3.11 (IDA US $ 0.50).&#13;
3.91   Retroactive Financing. In order to keep the momentum of project&#13;
implementation started under the pilot ESRF, retroactive financing will be made available&#13;
for expenditures incurred after December 1, 1995 up to US$ 1.75 million ( 10 percent of&#13;
the IDA credit) for social and economic infrastructure and services sub-projects, and&#13;
capacity building and training activities.&#13;
K. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
3.92   The project is estimated to be disbursed over a period of five years. Annual IDA&#13;
disbursements are shown in Table 12. Estimates are based on credit effectiveness by&#13;
June 1996, and satisfactory implementation experience under the pilot phase. Allocation&#13;
and disbursement of the IDA Credit are provided in Table 12.&#13;

3.93   Several special accounts, as may be required under the co-financing arrangements,&#13;
will be opened in a freely convertible currency with a commercial bank acceptable to&#13;
IDA. The authorized allocation to the special account(s) will be set at a level sufficient to&#13;
cover about four months of estimated expenditures eligible for financing by IDA and any&#13;
other donors funds managed by IDA. In the case of the IDA Special Account, the&#13;
authorized allocation will be US $1.5 million. However, until cumulative disbursements&#13;
reach US $5.0 million equivalent, the initial deposit to the Special Account will be&#13;
limited to 50% of the authorized allocation. For local currency expenditures and&#13;
operational costs not financed by the Bank, the Central Office of the ECDF will open a&#13;
second account in local currency into which the Government contribution will be deposited.&#13;

3.94   The Management Office will be responsible for preparing disbursement&#13;
applications for submission to IDA. Applications for (a) direct payments, and (b)&#13;
issuance of special commitments in guarantee of letters of credit for payments in excess&#13;
of the equivalent of US$ 100,000 will be submitted directly to IDA. Expenditures for&#13;
contracts for individual consultant services not exceeding US$ 25,000 and for all other&#13;
contracts not exceeding US$ 50,000 will be claimed on the basis of statements of&#13;
expenditures. All other expenditures in excess of these amounts will be fully documented&#13;
when submitted to IDA for disbursement. Replenishment applications for the special&#13;
account(s) will be submitted at monthly intervals, irrespective of the volume of&#13;
transactions during each month, together with the required documentation. All&#13;
documentation supporting SOEs, both consolidated and regional, will be available at the&#13;
Management Office to facilitate inspection by Bank supervision missions.&#13;
3.95   The special account(s) and the project account will be under the financial&#13;
management of the Management Office. Each Regional Branch will open one account to&#13;
fund the sub-projects, and another account to fund its operating expenses. Funding&#13;
requirements for the first quarter will be submitted by each sub-office to the Management&#13;
Office which will make an initial advance to each of the two accounts sufficient to cover&#13;
the estimated outlays for the period. Thereafter each sub-office will submit&#13;
replenishment applications in accordance to the Operational Manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
3.96  Disbursement arrangements for sub-projects are detailed in the Operational&#13;
Manual. Advance payments up to 20% of the total project costs will be permitted,&#13;
without any bank guarantee, in the case of self-help projects and in civil works contracts&#13;
below US$ 50,000 in order to encourage the development of grassroots contracting&#13;
industry. All subsequent disbursements will be made on the verification of work having&#13;
been satisfactorily performed and disbursements will be proportionate to the works&#13;
completed. Administrative or overhead expenses of implementing agencies will be&#13;
permitted as stated in the Financing Agreement but will in no case exceed 3% of the total&#13;
project costs. Such costs will be itemized and identified in the Financing Agreement.&#13;
3.97  Project Preparation Facility. An advance from the Project Preparation Facility&#13;
equal to the amount of US S 300.000 has been approved to finance expenditures related to&#13;
the institutional strengthening of ECDF, including the MIS.&#13;
3.98  Depositing of the Government's share of project financing for the first three&#13;
months of project implementation (equal to US $ 0.4 million), will be a condition for&#13;
credit effectiveness.&#13;
L. ACCOUNTING, AUDITING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING&#13;
3.99  In the expanded phase of the Project, the accounting system will accommodate the&#13;
significantly expanded size of the program. Those Regional Branches located in towns&#13;
with banking facilities will be provided with advances to allow the purchase of locally&#13;
available materials and labor. These advances will be on an imprest basis and local&#13;
accounting responsibilities will be limited to summarizing payments and receipts, and&#13;
submitting such records with all supporting documents to the Management Office in&#13;
Asmara. All accounts will be maintained by the Management Office.&#13;
3.100 Fund accounts are presently being maintained in accordance with Generally&#13;
Accepted Accounting Standards (GAAS) on a PC-based accounting program designed by&#13;
the Fund. In order to facilitate production of financial information in a manner which&#13;
will allow it to be linked to technical and operational data, a new Windows-based&#13;
accounting program will be acquired to permit full integration of accounting information&#13;
into the Windows-based Management Information System. This program will also have&#13;
a module integrating the preparation of withdrawal applications into the accounting and&#13;
MIS. Existing accounting staff in the Management Office are thought to be sufficient to&#13;
cope with the accounting requirements of the expanded program, once the existing&#13;
manual accounts (which have been maintained on a parallel basis to check the validity of&#13;
the PC-based program) are no longer maintained. An accountant will be employed for&#13;
each Regional Branch with its own advance float. Training will be provided under the&#13;
capacity building program to familiarize staff with the new accounting and MIS&#13;
programs.&#13;
3.101 The annual financial statements ofthe ECDF will be audited in accordance with&#13;
International Standards of Auditing by independent auditors acceptable to the&#13;
Association. The audited financial statements with the auditor's report thereon and the&#13;
auditor's management letter covering internal control and accounting procedures&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
weaknesses discovered as a result of the audit, will be sent to IDA within six months of&#13;
the end of the period audited.&#13;
M. POVERTY CATEGORY&#13;
3.102 The project is mainly targeted at rural communities, particularly those living in&#13;
the poorest, most neglected, and war affected areas of the country. While the&#13;
infrastructure and services provided by ECDF will benefit the community as a whole,&#13;
special attention will be given to maximize the benefits for particularly vulnerable&#13;
groups, such as returning refugees, demobilized soldiers, poor women. Also the pilot&#13;
Savings and Credit component, while not restricted to any specific target group, will&#13;
provide special benefit to disadvantaged groups.&#13;
3.103 The project will contribute to poverty reduction by providing poor communities&#13;
with basic infrastructure and services to improve productive outputs and incomes, and&#13;
improving the quality of basic health care, education, nutrition, and access to water.&#13;
N. IMPACT ON WOMEN&#13;
3.104 In line with the Government's strong emphasis on the economic and social&#13;
development of women, the ECDF has developed a full set of actions to increase and&#13;
assess the benefits of sub-projects on poor women. These actions include: (i) the&#13;
commitment to give special priority to proposals with women as major beneficiaries, or&#13;
which are prompted by women; (ii) a special focus on women in community&#13;
participation, and training to encourage the active role of women in Community Project&#13;
Committees; (iii) efforts to hire women as staff, and as local facilitators, particularly for&#13;
the implementation of the pilot Savings &amp; Credit component, in order to maximize&#13;
benefits to women and encourage their participation; and finally (iv) the inclusion in the&#13;
MIS of specific indicators to measure gender impact. More details about these activities&#13;
are given in the Gender Action Plan, provided in Annex N.&#13;
0. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
3.105 Already during the pilot phase, sustainability has been a major concern for the&#13;
Fund, and training and capacity building for local communities, mainly aiming at&#13;
improving the quality of the maintenance of the infrastructure, has been built in the sub-&#13;
projects. In the expanded phase these issues will be dealt with in a more systematic way,&#13;
through the Capacity Building Program, whose major component is related to building&#13;
within local communities the capacity necessary to adequately build and maintain the&#13;
assets and services created with the ECDF's support.&#13;
3.106 The capacity building process will start with the assessment of the community&#13;
ownership during the sub-project appraisal, by ensuring that only sub-projects that&#13;
respond to the needs expressed by the community, and that the community has identified&#13;
will be financed. It will continue by ensuring a strong community involvement during all&#13;
phases ofproject implementation, with special attention to maintenance arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
(care to maintenance arrangement has also been a good practice during the pilot phase).&#13;
Finally, in line with the Government policy, ECDF will promote and facilitate community&#13;
involvement in the-management of the assets and services financed.&#13;
3.107 The steps taken to support the sustainability of ECDF-financed sub-projects will&#13;
also include: (i) an assessment of community commitment and capacity during the sub-&#13;
project appraisal, which will ensure local ownership and motivation to maintain assets&#13;
created with ECDF support; (ii) capacity building and participative processes to&#13;
strengthen the involvement of local communities in all phases of project implementation,&#13;
with special attention to maintenance arrangements; (iii) community investments in sub-&#13;
project costs, and contracts on their maintenance responsibility; (iv) prior to sub-project&#13;
financing decisions, clear commitment from sector agencies to budget recurrent costs for&#13;
utilization and maintenance of ECDF-financed infrastructure; (v) selection of&#13;
technologies that lend themselves to community-based maintenance; and (vi) training of&#13;
sector experts and community specialists in technical aspects related to maintenance. The&#13;
size and cost of each component have been reviewed during Appraisal on the basis of&#13;
need assessments and of the estimated implementing capacity of the country. Recurrent&#13;
costs implications have been calculated (see section 3. E), and found insignificant.&#13;
P. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
3.108 With the single exception of the RRPE, the ECDF is the first operation that the&#13;
Bank is financing in Eritrea. The Bank's strategy, in line with the Government's policy,&#13;
has a major target the alleviation of poverty. The results of the analytical activities&#13;
carried out define four major sets of activities to achieve these objectives: (i) supporting&#13;
the participation of communities in the development process, including the provision,&#13;
management, and maintenance of basic social services, and building community&#13;
managerial and implementation capacity; (ii) strengthening the role of private sector in&#13;
local development efforts; (iii) improving cost-efficiency and maximizing cost-recovery&#13;
in the provision of services; and (iv) focusing on the social and economic advancement of&#13;
women, and on environmental conservation. The ECDF would provide an important&#13;
vehicle to implement this strategy.&#13;
3.109 Moreover, the Bank has supported social funds in almost every region of the&#13;
world. Like the pilot ECRF they have shown that community-initiated infrastructure&#13;
projects can be implemented at a lower cost than equivalent publicly managed projects&#13;
(see section on experience of the pilot ECRF). The social fund mechanism can be an&#13;
effective way of attracting community investments for development, which reduces the&#13;
costs to public funds and establishes a basis of ownership around which maintenance&#13;
arrangements can be built. Successful social funds have made a valuable contribution to&#13;
community development, by building managerial competencies, encouraging community&#13;
decision making on shared assets, and developing a sense of achievement and self-&#13;
reliance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
Q. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
3.110 Benefits. The ECDF will contribute to the much needed rebuilding of social and&#13;
physical infrastructure in Eritrea. Since it is a demand-based project and will finance&#13;
only those sub-projects that are requested by the communities, it is not possible to predict&#13;
in advance the composition of the project. However, based on data gathered from the&#13;
pilot phase, the following results are expected. It is expected that 22 primary and junior&#13;
secondary schools will be built per year, increasing their total number from 575 now to&#13;
687 by the end of the decade. Based on the current norm of about 500 students per&#13;
school, the new schools would provide enrollment opportunities for about 55,000&#13;
additional students, or an increase of over 20%. These schools would be built in villages&#13;
and communities which do not have any facility at all, and it expected that they would be&#13;
fully utilized since communities will have asked for them. There is not enough data yet&#13;
in Eritrea to calculate the rate of return to this investment, but estimates for other&#13;
countries show an average private rate of return of 41% to basic education in sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa (higher than in any other part of the world) and a social rate of return of 24%.&#13;
Additionally, there are other social benefits through the impact of education on health and&#13;
fertility. It is also expected that about 20 health stations/centers will be built per year,&#13;
increasing by two/thirds the number currently existing (160). Data on outpatient visits&#13;
nationwide show that about 15,000 visits occur per year per health facility, translating to&#13;
an average of less than one visit per person. This is exceptionally low; in other Sub-&#13;
Saharan countries the number of visits is 1.5-2, and in more affluent countries it is 7-8. it&#13;
is reasonably expected that with the project the utilization rate will increase closer to the&#13;
regional average, with current improvement in health status. The ECDF would provide&#13;
drinking water facilities to 230 communities covering 5% of the rural population. While&#13;
there is no data on the availability of safe water in rural areas, it is known that most&#13;
Eritreans have access only to unprotected wells and rivers. A study of 244 villages&#13;
estimated that per capita consumption of clean water was only 2.5 liters per capita per&#13;
day. For this meager amount women and children may travel up to 2 hours each way,&#13;
contributing substantially to a long working day lasting 14-16 hours. School-age&#13;
children, particularly girls may be held back from school (a study of distance to water&#13;
facilities and school attendance in Nigeria has shown a strong correlation). The health&#13;
consequences of polluted water are well-known; for example the percentage of deaths of&#13;
children under five in Eritrea due to diarrhea is as high as 13% (double the rate in Uganda&#13;
and Tanzania), and diarrhea is one of the leading causes of death for this group.&#13;
3.1 11 The project is also expected to rehabilitate and improve about 1,200 km of rural&#13;
roads (about 50% of the feeder/local/minor roads network). In a country where nearly&#13;
100% of these roads are classified to be in poor or very poor condition, this component&#13;
can be expected to provide a major impetus to increased economic activity, as well as&#13;
better access to the social infrastructure being built. The micro-credit component will be&#13;
tested on a pilot basis. Preliminary analysis of data on poverty collected in a Rapid&#13;
Appraisal Survey (1993-94) shows that self-employment and trade is critical for growing&#13;
out of poverty. The share of income from these activities, generally in the informal&#13;
sector, is 21% for the non-poor, compared to about 10.5 for the poor. Experience&#13;
elsewhere suggests that the provision of small amounts of capital can make a substantial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
difference. Experience with the pilot project demonstrates and enhances the cost-&#13;
effectiveness and feasibility of realizing these benefits.&#13;
3.1 12 Risks. The main risk to the success of the project concerns the weakness of local&#13;
implementation capacity in some of the poorest and most isolated regions of the country,&#13;
most in need of ECDF support. Therefore the identification of capacity building and&#13;
training needs for all parts involved in sub-projects' implementation --ECDF staff,&#13;
provincial offices staff, communities, facilitators-- as well as the design of the relevant&#13;
capacity building and training activities will be of particular importance in project's&#13;
preparation.&#13;
3.113 A second risk relates to the quality of some types of infrastructure to be developed&#13;
with ECDF support. To respond to this risk, the ECDF has established a collaborative&#13;
program with the relevant sector agencies to build capacity, produce rigorous standards,&#13;
and improve the design and monitoring of the construction. This will be supported by&#13;
outside experts that will promote technical and supervision assistance. Another risk&#13;
relates to the sustainability and effective utilization of the assets created with ECDF&#13;
support. High priority is being given to measures that will enhance sustainability,&#13;
including careful planning of maintenance programs, training of communities in&#13;
maintenance routines, and assurances that recurrent costs will be allocated to support both&#13;
utilization and maintenance.&#13;
R. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
3.114 Conditions for Credit Effectiveness. The Government will have:&#13;
(a) established a Local Account in the name of ECDF and deposited counterpart&#13;

that any proposed changes to the Operational Manual would be subject to&#13;
agreement by IDA;&#13;
(b) twelve months after effectiveness, the Government of Eritrea will require an&#13;
independent entity to conduct a procurement assessment, on terms of reference to&#13;
be developed in consultation with IDA, to evaluate the economy and efficiency&#13;
of procurement and identify the need for any modifications to procurement&#13;
arrangements;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
(c) the Government of Eritrea and IDA will conduct a mid-term review of project&#13;
implementation and impact;&#13;

of the ECDF will at all times have qualifications commensurate to their duties;&#13;
(f) the Government of Eritrea will make quarterly deposits of amounts representing&#13;
its share of project costs in to the account established for that purpose;&#13;
(g) the Government and IDA will review annually the interest rate applied from&#13;
ECDF to Village Administrations or other financial intermediaries for the Pilot&#13;
Savings and Credit Program; and&#13;
(h) ECDF will annually submit to IDA for review an assessment of the progress&#13;
made in the work program and planned for the following year, including the&#13;
activities for the Pilot Savings and Credit Component.&#13;
3.116 Subject to the above conditions and assurances, the proposed project constitutes a&#13;
basis for an IDA credit of SDR 11.8 million (US$ 17.5 million equivalent) to Eritrea at&#13;
standard terms with 40 years maturity.&#13;

Summary of the Evaluation of the Pilot Project&#13;
1.    Background of the Mid-term Evaluation. A mid-term evaluation of the Pilot&#13;
Community Rehabilitation Fund was carried out in September 1994 by a team composed&#13;
by local and international independent consultants, and its finding were discussed with&#13;
the Government during a supervision mission carried out in February 1995. The&#13;
objectives of the evaluation were to (i) assess the quality of sub-projects implementation&#13;
and community participation; (ii) analyze the balance of ECRF's project portfolio; (iii)&#13;
determine the relevance of ECRF-financed sub-projects to community needs; (iv) assess&#13;
the management of sub-project operations; and (v) assess the scope for an expansion of&#13;
ECRF activities, including the identification of capacity building needs. ECRF's overall&#13;
performance was assessed as satisfactory, especially given the uncertainties due to the&#13;
country situation in the immediate aftermath of the war, and the severe constraints (in&#13;
terms of staffing and equipment) under which the Fund had to operate during its initial&#13;
stage of operations. The evaluation identified the ECRF's greatest asset as its dedicated&#13;
staff and their problem solving capacity and determination to succeed against substantial&#13;
obstacles. At a greater level of specificity, the evaluation judged the most important&#13;
achievements of the ECRF to be: (i) its outreach capacity to communities, specially in&#13;
remote areas; and (ii) the quality and cost-effectiveness of the sub-projects implemented.&#13;
2.    Content of the Evaluation. The evaluation focused on the following areas: (i)&#13;
characteristics and structure of the ECRF; (ii) the project cycle; (iii) community&#13;
participation and contribution; (iv) major achievements of ECRF; and (v)&#13;
recommendations for an expanded phase. Section (i); (ii); and (iii) have been&#13;
summarized in the main SAR. Section (iv) is summarized in the following paragraphs.&#13;
3.    Recommendations for an Expanded Phase. The evaluation made&#13;
recommendations concerning four major areas relating to: (i) capacity building, staff&#13;
training and recruitment; (ii) expansion of ECRF activities; (iii) ECRF operations; and&#13;
(iv) social infrastructure projects. Regarding capacity building, staff training, and&#13;
recruitment the evaluation suggested that ECRF: (a) strengthen its outreach capacity&#13;
through training for ECRF staff, (b) develop an improved salary scale and system of&#13;
incentives to retain experienced staff, and attract the new staff necessary for the expanded&#13;
phase; and (c) consider a phased program of decentralized responsibility to ECRF Sub-&#13;
Units in the provinces, to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of ECRF's services&#13;
to the communities.&#13;
4.    Regarding the expansion of ECRF activities, the evaluation recommended that&#13;
ECRF: (a) develop a strategy to strengthen community participation, through the&#13;
provision of training in the design, management, implementation, and evaluation of sub-&#13;
projects to baito members, development committees, community facilitators, and other&#13;
local groups involved in assisting ECRF activities; (b) conduct a rapid assessment of the&#13;
needs and implementing capacity in all the provinces of the country, as basis for planning&#13;
the staffing of ECRF Sub-Units and the provision of training for local facilitators of&#13;
implementation; and (c) develop a strategy to transfer technical skills at the community&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
level to increase their participation in project design and to improve their capacity to&#13;
maintain and service assets built with ECRF financing.&#13;
5.     Regarding ECRF operations, the mid-term evaluation emphasized the need to: (a)&#13;
build upon the present level of collaboration with local technical specialists to assist the&#13;
implementation of more sophisticated types of sub-projects during the expanded phase&#13;
(such as small-scale irrigation, feeder roads, income-generation ventures); (b) evaluate&#13;
and improve the appraisal methodologies used by the ECRF, especially with regard to&#13;
rural feeder roads, rural water supply, and micro-credit sub-projects; (c) improve the&#13;
facilities of the ECRF Sub-Units to ensure effective community outreach and frequent&#13;
supervision of implementation; and (d) revise the Operational Manual to reflect the nature&#13;
of the expanded project, with particular attention to monitoring project impact on&#13;
beneficiaries.&#13;
6.    Finally, regarding social infrastructure the evaluation emphasized the need to: (a)&#13;
improve the design of health stations to fit climatic variations; (b) include the&#13;
construction of junior secondary schools in the types of projects eligible for ECRF&#13;
financing, because of their vital significance in the structure of basic education in Eritrea;&#13;
(c) build on the present close collaboration with the line ministries, at the central and&#13;
provincial level; and (d) take measures (such as training for local communities) to ensure&#13;
the sustainability and maintenance of social infrastructure built with ECRF financing.&#13;

Management Information System (MIS) and Monitoring Indicators&#13;
1.    Monitoring and evaluation are the two purposes of the ECDF Management Information&#13;
System, which will provide managers of the Fund with access to physical and financial&#13;
information about the progress of project activities and the financial commitments and&#13;
expenditure of the Fund. It will provide the necessary information to generate monthly, quarterly,&#13;
and annual reports. It will also store information to respond to ad-hoc queries, and to carry out&#13;
periodic assessments of the impact of ECDF activities on beneficiaries. The system is essentially&#13;
a centralized one with networked microcomputers all maintained in the various offices of the MO&#13;
(finance, logistics, engineering etc.). Certain MIS functions, including project data entry and&#13;
project monitoring, will however be progressively transferred to the regional Sub-Offices as the&#13;
capabilities of these are strengthened. The system allows password access and updating of the&#13;
centralized project files by each section. Information will be gathered from each stage in the&#13;
project cycle, and reported in one or more of the fonnal project reports.&#13;
MIS and the Stages in the Project Cycle&#13;
Stage 1: Project request, appraisal and approval.&#13;
Input         Project Request Form, Field Visit Report, Appraisal Report and&#13;
documents:   Budget prepared by the Project Officer (PO) entered into ledger in the Sub-&#13;
Office, and then transferred to the Management Office and entered in MIS by&#13;
the Engineering Unit. Additionally, the Engineering Unit will enter the outcome&#13;
of the evaluation committees assessment.&#13;
Outputs:     Quarterly status report about progress in processing new project applications:&#13;
analysis of new applications by sector, beneficiaries (including gender) and cost;&#13;
analysis of contracted projects by type, beneficiaries (number, gender etc.), costs,&#13;
community contribution, technical features, and environmental aspects; and&#13;
analysis of requests by outcome (rejection, further study, deferral, or acceptance).&#13;
Stage 2: Implementation Monitoring Through to Project Completion &amp; Handover&#13;
Inputs:       Monthly reports will be prepared for each sub-project, up until completion by the&#13;
POs in the regional Sub-Office, and forwarded to the Management Office for&#13;
entry into the MIS. The PO will also prepare Handover Certificates and&#13;
Completion Reports for each sub-project at the end of the implementation phase,&#13;
after discussion with representatives of the beneficiaries and Community Project&#13;
Committees as well as, where applicable, the local govemment authority.&#13;
Outputs:      The data will be forwarded monthly to the Management Office where it will be&#13;
entered into the MIS. It will be used to generate monthly analysis of projects&#13;
under implementation by work done, and by funds disbursed. In addition,&#13;
analysis of projects completed will be produced quarterly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex C&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
Stage 3: Post completion monitoring and follow-up.&#13;
Inputs:       All projects will be visited by the PO at least once after sufficient time has&#13;
elapsed to enable a settled pattern of utilization to have become established, and&#13;
for important features of sustainability such as maintenance and participatory&#13;
management to have started. (The period between completion and the post-&#13;
completion follow-up review will initially be set at six months but may, in the&#13;
light of experience, be extended to twelve months). Information will be collected&#13;
using the technical checklist developed for the relevant sector. The PO will then&#13;
be responsible for producing a Post-Completion Monitoring Report. From the&#13;
information in the post-completion report, the PO will make an assessment of&#13;
project performance using the following system of ratings.&#13;
Project Officer's Assessment&#13;

Cooperating Agency Obligation&#13;
Codes:&#13;
A - Satisfactory compared with appraisal expectation.&#13;
B - Not satisfactory, but Committee taking appropriate action to resolve the problem(s).&#13;
C - Not satisfactory. Action needed but not being taken. ECDF may need to intervene.&#13;
Z - Not relevant.&#13;
Outputs:      The ratings, together with some quantitative data would be computerized and&#13;
would be one of the criteria used to analyze performance, to select sub-projects&#13;
for subsequent visits and for impact assessment.&#13;
MIS for the Pilot Savings and Credit Program&#13;
2.     The MIS system will focus on the collection by the Savings and Credit Committee (SCC)&#13;
bookkeeper of all information on savings transactions (deposits and withdrawals) and loan&#13;
transactions (loan disbursements, and principal and interest collection) by individual program&#13;
participants. Each transaction should require only two entries, one on an individual account card,&#13;
and one on the consolidated cash ledgers. At the end of each month, the ECDF zonal credit&#13;
officer will help reconcile the consolidated cash ledgers with cash balances held by the SCC.&#13;
He/she will also, together with the SCC bookkeeper, prepare a monthly list of all loans delinquent&#13;
for over 30 days in the village. Finally, at the end of each quarter, the zonal credit officer will,&#13;
with the assistance of the SCC bookkeeper, calculate repayment and delinquency rates for the&#13;
village. At the end of each quarter the zonal credit officer will also compile the simple&#13;
information contained on individual credit applications for the village, including borrower&#13;
gender, age and the size of loans - such information to be used by ECDF to help evaluate the&#13;
socio-economic impact of the program.&#13;
3.     Zonal credit officers will consolidate on a monthly basis the information contained in the&#13;
forms submitted by individual SCC in the zone. That will allow him to produce summaries of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex C&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
loan and savings activity, and a reconciliation of cash balances for the zone. At the end of each&#13;
quarter, he will also calculate consolidated collection rates and delinquency rates for the zone.&#13;
4.     Forms summarizing the loan activities and cash transactions will be sent monthly, and&#13;
forms summarizing collection and delinquency rates will be sent on a quarterly basis to central&#13;
level and imputed into the computerized MIS. The MIS will produce: (i) monthly summaries of&#13;
loan and savings activities for the entire program; (ii) monthly cash reconciliation statements;&#13;
and, (iii) quarterly calculations of collection and delinquency rates per zone.&#13;
5.    Finally, a performance summary will be produced, consolidating key performance&#13;
indicators for each zonal officer. These indicators, which will comprise the number of village&#13;
banks constituted, total number of members of these banks, savings collected, loans made, and&#13;
collection and delinquency rates, will serve as a basis for the evaluation of the performance of&#13;
each zonal officer. As soon as produced, the monthly MIS output will also be discussed between&#13;
the manager of the micro-credit program and the ECDF project manager. On the basis of MIS&#13;
data and other information, progress towards the achievement of program goals will be discussed&#13;
and problems identified and addressed.&#13;
ECDF Reviews and Reports&#13;
6.     Monthly Reports. Short monthly disbursement reports and summaries of sub-&#13;
projects in the pipeline will be produced by the ECDF. These reports will include:&#13;
- Monthly sub-project processing summaries (covering the numbers of sub-projects&#13;
appraised, under implementation and completed, by type of sub-project for the relevant&#13;
month and the year to date);&#13;
- Summary of funds committed and disbursed by sub-project;&#13;
- Current analysis of time and cost performance.&#13;
7.     Quarterly Reports. The Quarterly Report will be submitted to within 6 weeks of&#13;
completion of the quarter in question. The essential components of this report will be:&#13;
- Manager's progress report for the quarter with reference to annual plan;&#13;

Implementation Plan&#13;
1.    The Eritrean Community Rehabilitation Fund was established to support the&#13;
rehabilitation of the basic social and economic infrastructure of the country, specially in&#13;
those areas most affected by the war and recurrent droughts, and to respond to the needs of&#13;
particularly vulnerable groups such as returning refugees, women head of household,&#13;
demobilized soldiers, and orphans. Since ECRF activities during the pilot phase have&#13;
demonstrated the success of its community-based approach, the Government has decided to&#13;
expand ECRF into one of its most important instruments for poverty alleviation.&#13;
2.    The Eritrean Community Development Fund (ECDF) has been established pursuant a&#13;
Government Directive dated January 2, 1996, as an autonomous institution within the&#13;
Ministry of Local Government. It has suitable procurement and disbursement procedures&#13;
and a transparent management and financial system, and operates on the basis of an&#13;
Operational Manuals prepared by the borrower and accepted by the Bank.&#13;
3.    The Operational Manual. The Operational Manual consists of five sections. The&#13;
first one describes the ECDF's role and mandate in the framework of the overall Government&#13;
development policy, and strategy for poverty alleviation. The second section covers the&#13;
structure of the Fund, its organization and functions, the operating procedures, and the&#13;
administrative and staffing guidelines and rules. The third section deals with the rules and&#13;
procedures of the sub-project cycle, including the standards that must be respected at&#13;
different parts of the cycle within each sub-sector. The fourth section covers the&#13;
administrative and financial procedures regarding disbursement and procurement; as well as&#13;
the administrative and financial procedures regarding accounting, financial reporting and&#13;
auditing, the ECDF budget, and the selection and management of staff. Much of the material&#13;
of the four sections was already included in the Operational Manual used during the pilot&#13;
phase. The fifth section deals with the pilot Savings and Credit component. The Manual has&#13;
been officially adopted by ECDF.&#13;
4.    Handbooks. The Operational Manual will be supplemented by technical Handbooks&#13;
on Rural Water Supply, Environment, Rural Feeder Roads and MIS. The implementation of&#13;
capacity building and training activity will be supported by a Capacity Building Support&#13;
Document. The Handbooks will include project design, appraisal, and implementation&#13;
guidelines; technical standards and specifications; training materials for communities and&#13;
other agents involved in implementation. The Handbooks will be prepared by the&#13;
Management Office in collaboration with local or international consultants (if needed), on&#13;
the basis of terms of reference agreed upon during Appraisal (TOR are available in the&#13;
project file). It has also been agreed that work on the Handbooks will start before the&#13;
beginning of the expanded phase, and that it will be completed before the end of the first&#13;
year of project implementation.&#13;
5.    The Role of the World Bank during Project Implementation. During the start-up&#13;
phase the Bank and the ECDF will organize a "project launch workshop" which would focus&#13;
on: (i) introducing the Fund's objectives, approaches, project appraisal and approval&#13;
procedures and implementation arrangements; (ii) project monitoring and implementation&#13;
arrangements, including reporting to the Bank; and (iii) procurement and disbursement&#13;
requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
6.    During the implementation phase the Bank's main concern woald be the supervision&#13;
of the project. The Bank's supervision, mid-term review, and mid-term evaluation missions&#13;
would examine the following: (i) the effectiveness of the Fund in attaining its objectives; (ii)&#13;
the compliance of the Fund's financial management, accounting and disbursement operations&#13;
and procurement practices with the Operational Manual; and (iii) the utilization of the results&#13;
of the monitoring activities for project management decisions.&#13;
7.    Supervision Plan. Intensive supervision will be carried out during the first 30&#13;
months of the project, until the mid-term evaluation. Supervision missions will be carried out&#13;
in collaboration with other involved donors and ECDF staff, and will consist of extensive&#13;
field visits to the sub-project sites, as well as visits to the Regional Branches to verify their&#13;
implementing capacity and the opportunities for major decentralization. Supervision will&#13;
start before the beginning of the expanded phase, to review the preparatory steps agreed&#13;
upon, and due to be undertaken in the framework of the capacity building project (this phase&#13;
will start immediately after negotiation). These steps will include: (i) recruitment of high&#13;
level staff for the Management Office and the Regional Branches; (ii) preparation of the&#13;
Technical handbooks on the basis of the TORs agreed upon; (iii) intensifying the promotion&#13;
activities with local communities; (iv) completing the design of the MIS.&#13;
8.    During the first 30 months, there will be three supervision missions each year (one&#13;
every four months). After the mid-term review, and if its results are positive, the supervision&#13;
pace might be reduced to two missions per year. Intensive supervision will be undertaken for&#13;
the pilot Savings and Credit program during the whole life of the project, due to the&#13;
experimental nature of this component. An important component of the supervision&#13;
activities will be the organization of consultation meetings with the beneficiaries, in which&#13;
the impact of the activities financed by ECDF will be discussed. Impact analyses will also&#13;
be carried out through the research fund, managed by the ECDF Management Office, and&#13;
included in the Capacity Building Support Program.&#13;
9.    The Role of the Capacity Building Support Program. The role of the Capacity&#13;
Building Support Project will be crucial to ensure that: (i) there is an effective and adequate&#13;
promotion activity, which guarantees a wide and diversified outreach; (ii) capacity is built in&#13;
the local communities to play an effective role in all the different phases of project&#13;
implementation, as well as in the maintenance and sustainability of the assets and services&#13;
created with the Fund's support; (iii) capacity is built in the Fund's Management Office and&#13;
Regional Branches to appraise, prepare, implement, supervise, monitor, and evaluate sub-&#13;
projects in each sector; and (iv) adequate technical capacity is built in the Fund, as well as in&#13;
the line ministries, and other public and private institutions involved in sub-project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
10.   Financing Plan. The expected Bank financing, donors inputs, government and&#13;
community contributions of the project have been agreed upon. It is expected that some&#13;
donors may made available financial resources to start the preparation for the expanded&#13;
phase before effectiveness.&#13;
11.   Specific Steps to Attain Development Objectives. The following steps would be&#13;
taken before and during the start-up phase of the ECDF expanded phase:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
(a) recruitment of professional staff for the Management Office and Regional Branches&#13;
(the process to recruit all the additional staff for the Management Office, and at least&#13;
one additional project officer, and the micro-finance specialist for those regions&#13;
where this activity will be started on a pilot basis will start after negotiation and will&#13;
be completed before effectiveness);&#13;
(b) securing of adequate office space (the Fund has already an operating Branch in each&#13;
region, but in a few cases the structure may not be sufficient for the increased staff);&#13;
(c) orientation programs would be carried out for the ECDF staff of the Management&#13;
Office and Regional Branches starting after negotiation;&#13;
(d) promotional activities would be intensified;&#13;
(e) existing staff would share the experience of other social funds through study tours&#13;
and participate in short term specialized courses.&#13;
10.   Project Accounting and Monitoring. Agreement on the additional requirements&#13;
necessary for the present Accounting and Monitoring Management Information System have&#13;
been reached during Appraisal. The Accounting and Monitoring Management Information&#13;
System will be operational before effectiveness.&#13;

Environmental Analysis&#13;
I.     Background. The purpose of this analysis is to assess whether: (i) the activities to be&#13;
implemented under the project can be undertaken in a sound and sustainable manner; (ii) what&#13;
scope there is to mitigate or minimize any potentially negative impacts or to promote&#13;
environmentally positive actions; and (iii) whether the overall policy and institutional context as&#13;
well as the technical capacity of the project staff are adequate for the purpose of ensuring that&#13;
environmental issues can be given due weight and treated effectively during Project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
2.     The Policy Context: the National Environmental Management Plan for Eritrea&#13;
(NEMP-E). In Eritrea, environmental issues have been assigned a high priority by the&#13;
Government. This stems from a recognition that the sustainable use of the country's natural capital&#13;
will be essential if the country's overall strategy for long-term growth is to be realized. This&#13;
commitment, endorsed at the highest level of government, provides the backdrop to all major&#13;
development programs being initiated and implemented in Eritrea and supplies an important&#13;
impetus for the incorporation of environmental objectives into the activities of the ECDF.&#13;
3.     In terms of the impact on income, productivity and human welfare, land degradation and&#13;
the associated problem of deforestation are two areas of great concern in Eritrea. The other broad&#13;
area of concern is the scarcity and poor quality of water resources. In the rural areas, year round&#13;
access to drinking water is problematic while bacteriological contamination of water contributes to&#13;
high morbidity rates among children. Lack of reliable water supply also affects agricultural and&#13;
livestock productivity. The poor in Eritrea are the most vulnerable in situations of environmental&#13;
degradation given their extensive reliance on the natural resource base around them. Consultations&#13;
with communities during the preparation of the Government's National Environmental&#13;
Management Plan for Eritrea (NEMP-E) revealed an acute awareness on the part of communities of&#13;
the declining quality of their environment, yet little leeway to effectively address the problems.&#13;
Lack of financial resources, limited knowledge of viable solutions or alternatives to harmful&#13;
practices, and short-term planning horizons by farmers and households have all contributed to the&#13;
perpetuation of environmental problems.&#13;
4.     The Government of Eritrea has recently adopted a National Environmental Management&#13;
Plan for Eritrea (NEMP-E). This document, which has been the result of a process of extensive&#13;
consultation with and between both community organizations and all major ministries of the&#13;
Government, was presented for review, comment and discussion at a National Conference on the&#13;
Environment in February 1995. The main objective of the NEMP-E is to provide a framework for&#13;
coordinating the protection and enhancement of Eritrea's natural resource base so that optimal&#13;
social and economic development can be achieved. To this end the plan examines the&#13;
interconnections between population, resources and environment within the Eritrean context, the&#13;
relationship between NEMP-E and other national initiatives such as development planning and&#13;
macroeconomic policies, and lays out a number of guiding principles for the integration of&#13;
environmental objectives into the national planning process. The plan also highlights the main areas&#13;
of environmental concern in the country. These cover issues relating to environmental health,&#13;
natural resource management, including land, water, forests and the preservation of coastal areas&#13;
and bio-diversity, and transboundary environmental issues. The plan also outlines the&#13;
recommended institutional arrangements necessary to implement the plan and includes a&#13;
compilation of programs and projects to support the objectives of the NEMP-E.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
5.     Implementation of the NEMP-E. The NEMP-E must be considered a starting point for&#13;
the development of programs of action to address specific environmental issues and to lay the basis&#13;
for evolving environmental standards and regulation. The real challenge now facing the country is&#13;
to put the vision of the NEMP-E in practice. While the overall political will is high at the central&#13;
level, implementation capacity remains weak and it could be several years before effective&#13;
mechanisms are developed to enable the integration of environmental concerns into the mainstream&#13;
development processes of the country. Institutional arrangements are yet to be finalized and&#13;
recommended structures will take time to establish on a fornal basis. Most legislation relating to&#13;
different aspects of resource management and environmental standards is at a very preliminary&#13;
stage of development. The exception is the recent 'Land Proclamation' which effectively replaces&#13;
all preceding forms of land tenure in the country with lifetimes usufruct rights to land. The&#13;
proposed land reforns are initially to be implemented on a pilot basis and nationwide adoption will&#13;
happen at a later date. Meanwhile there is a lack of information on the natural resource base,&#13;
essential for sound environmental planning and management.&#13;
6.     Although the general institutional and legislative context for environmental management in&#13;
which the ECDF would operate will be sketchy, there is nevertheless scope for ensuring that the&#13;
Project can pursue the environmental objectives outlined in the NEMP-E. First, there would be a&#13;
concerted effort to develop ECDF's own capacity for environmental assessment and monitoring.&#13;
Indeed one of the underlying themes of the NEMP-E is that the environment should be treated not&#13;
as a separate sector requiring specialist inputs, but as an integral component of all sectors. The&#13;
Eritrean Agency for the Environment (EAE), established as an interim secretariat within the&#13;
Ministry of Local Government, but with a high degree of autonomy, will act as catalyst and&#13;
coordinator of environmental activities in the country with corresponding environmental councils to&#13;
be located at the regional level. It will also work at building up the skills and awareness of existing&#13;
Government staff in the line ministries and strengthening the capacity of individual ministries to&#13;
oversee the implementation of environmental assessments for projects within their respective areas&#13;
of responsibility.&#13;
7.     Second, through its close working associations with other Government departments, it is&#13;
expected that the Project would be able to benefit from on-going efforts at building up and&#13;
strengthening the data and information base on natural resources, particularly in the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture and the Department of Water Resources.&#13;
8.     Third, with its close working relationship with community groups and organizations, it is&#13;
envisaged that ECDF could make a considerable impact on environmental issues by interacting&#13;
directly at the local level. In fact, the NEMP-E envisages that better environmental practices can be&#13;
encouraged through a collaborative partnership between communities and the government, based&#13;
on an ongoing dialogue that would respect the traditional knowledge of communities while in turn&#13;
raising public awareness and supporting communities in finding more sustainable ways of&#13;
interacting with their environment. This is a process that need not depend on the existence of&#13;
formal government mechanisms for implementation. Instead it is expected to rely on the&#13;
traditionally strong organizational and mediating capacities of local village baitos to educate,&#13;
mobilize and enforce local level regulations in pursuit of environmental objectives.&#13;
9.     Environmental Issues Relating to Sub-Projects. Any program of poverty alleviation&#13;
such as the ECDF, and particularly if targeted at the rural areas, will inevitably entail activities&#13;
which impinge in some way on the local natural resource base. In a country such as Eritrea, where&#13;
a high degree of economic vulnerability prevails, a major concern is to ensure that efforts at&#13;
alleviating poverty should not result in the degradation of the natural resource base or in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
environmental health hazards that exacerbate this vulnerability. The objective of the Government&#13;
of Eritrea under the ECDF is to achieve a fine balance between encouraging the productive use of&#13;
the natural resource base and ensuring the protection and conservation of these same resources. In&#13;
most cases the negative environmental impact of the individual micro-project to be funded under&#13;
the ECDF is expected to be localized and limited. However, a number of environmental issues can&#13;
be highlighted under each sub-sector as follows:&#13;
10.    Water Supply. Water supply projects under the ECDF could generally be expected to&#13;
yield positive environmental outcomes for the communities concerned. Two main issues deserve&#13;
attention:&#13;
(i) Use of water points for watering livestock. In the lowland areas in particular, there may&#13;
be the risk of increased livestock concentrations around new water points with adverse&#13;
effects on surrounding grazing land. However, it is anticipated that most of the requests for&#13;
water points would emanate from sedentary farming communities who would be expected&#13;
to assume responsibility for regulating the use of such water points primarily for domestic&#13;
consumption.&#13;
(ii) Contamination of water source through poor maintenance of the wvater point&#13;
surroundings. The risk of such contamination can generally be offset by proper design of&#13;
the water point and training of community members in appropriate maintenance practices.&#13;
11.    Road Construction, As the road-works envisaged under this project would consist mostly&#13;
of the upgrading of existing footpaths and rehabilitation of existing small-scale feeder roads, the&#13;
adverse environmental impact is not anticipated to be significant. The following points may need&#13;
particular consideration, however:&#13;
(i) Erosion and slope stability. Local erosion problems can be exacerbated and slope&#13;
stability disturbed by road construction. These can be the result of deficient drainage or&#13;
modification of water flows. In most instances, potential problems can be avoided or&#13;
mitigated through appropriate design or by taking measures such as the prompt replanting&#13;
of vegetation on road embankments.&#13;
(ii) Impact on the local water system. Construction of a road could contribute to changes in&#13;
the flow and quality of surface water and groundwater, sometimes resulting in increased&#13;
flooding, siltation, or drying up of natural groundwater reserves/supplies. Most of the roads&#13;
envisaged under the ECDF are likely to be too small to have any major impact on water&#13;
flows.&#13;
12.    Social Infrastructure Projects. The environmental impact of these structures is likely to&#13;
be minimal. The only potential area of concern, would be to ensure the safe disposal of hazardous&#13;
materials from health centers. This can be achieved through the separation of degradable and non-&#13;
degradable materials and the construction of protected disposal pits for the more hazardous&#13;
materials. Meanwhile there would be scope to encourage environmentally positive measures under&#13;
this category of sub-projects. For instance the construction of pit latrines that can also serve as&#13;
demonstration sites could have a positive impact on hygiene practices, particularly amongst school&#13;
children, while the inclusion of properly designed roof catchments could help to improve the&#13;
availability of water.&#13;
13.    Pilot Savings and Credit Program. The Government anticipates that a wide range of&#13;
micro-enterprise and income-generating proposals would be received. Given the small-scale of the&#13;
activities envisaged, relatively few are expected to raise issues of any real consequence to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
environment. Typically the proposals are expected to include such activities as bee-keeping,&#13;
garnent making, establishing of grinding mills, etc., all of which are reasonably benign activities as&#13;
far as their impact on the environment is concerned. Obvious exception would be proposals&#13;
involving intensive use of raw materials such as wood for fuel or construction (e.g. brick-making&#13;
kilns), or activities generating potentially hazardous wastes (e.g. metal works, or skin and hides&#13;
production). Such proposals would be specifically reviewed with the community concerned in order&#13;
to find appropriate alternative materials or solutions for waste management.&#13;
14.    Soil, Water, and Forestry Conservation.. The government is also envisaging the&#13;
implementation of a number of "natural resources management" projects. These projects would&#13;
generally consist of hillside terracing, tree-planting and construction of check dams in catchment&#13;
areas or on road embankments. While these kinds of activity are aimed at environmental&#13;
improvements, a number of points will need to be kept in mind:&#13;
(i) Terracing. The beneficial effects of terracing are likely to be increased water infiltration&#13;
and hence recharging of local aquifers, as well as increased agriculture productivity.&#13;
However, in some catcliment areas, given low rainfall levels and high evapo-transpiration&#13;
rates, extensive terracing can also have the effect of reducing the amount of water that&#13;
drains into the catchment ar;a. It would thus be important at the design stage of the project&#13;
to obtain at least a basic picture of the main hydrological characteristics of the catchment&#13;
area so as to give a reasonably informed estimate of the extent of terracing required to yield&#13;
positive environmental effects. It would be also important to assess whether any&#13;
productivity and hydrological benefit can be achieved.&#13;
(ii) Tree planting. Tree planting has been widely encouraged in Eritrea because of the acute&#13;
shortage of wood and tree products in most areas of the country. It is also thought to have&#13;
the added benefit of helping to stabilize slopes and reducing surface run-off and soil loss.&#13;
Some of these benefits can be expected to accrue under the present project. However,&#13;
attention will need to be paid to the siting of tree plantation and to the kind of species&#13;
promoted. Given low rainfall and high evapo-transpiration rates, tree planting, in some&#13;
locations, may have the unintended effect of reducing groundwater availability and of&#13;
depriving surrounding vegetation of moisture. The effect can be particularly serious if fast&#13;
growing but water-hungry species such as eucalyptus are planted in areas which are already&#13;
water scarce. It would be important for the Project staff to have a sound understanding of&#13;
the local ecology of areas to be planted and to ensure that appropriate species are used if&#13;
planting is to proceed. Enforced enclosures that encourage the regeneration of natural&#13;
vegetation on hillsides imnay often be a more effective form of environmental conservation&#13;
than tree plantations.&#13;
(iii) Ensuring maintenance of terrace.: A problem reported by many agencies that have&#13;
sponsored large-scale terracing programs in Eritrea, is that of maintenance of the structures&#13;
once in place. The problem has often been that community members do not see any direct&#13;
benefit to themselves in undertaking such work and are hence reluctant to devote time to&#13;
maintenance unless compensated by food or cash. Poor maintenance of terraces can&#13;
sometimes cause greater problems than they were originally designed to address as the&#13;
collapse of any one part of a terrace can lead to the formation of deep gullies that only&#13;
exacerbate soil loss and run-off. The ECDF would experiment various community&#13;
approaches and incentive measures to ensure the long-term commitment of communities to&#13;
the maintenance of terraces or, where appropriate, tree plantations. For example, one&#13;
approach would be to introduce low-cost measures such as grass-strips, using vetiver grass,&#13;
soil and stone bunds, and encouraging retention of dung and crop residues on cropland to&#13;
improve ground cover, enhance soil fertility, and ultimately improve yield. The low-cost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
provision of fuelwood as an energy alternative to dung, fuel saving stoves, and improved&#13;
cut-and carry fodder as a substitute for crop residues are important elements of this&#13;
strategy.&#13;
15.    Environmental Categorization. The above analysis highlights that while it is anticipated&#13;
that there will be a number of environmental issues requiring particular attention during the&#13;
implementation of the project, most potential problems can be resolved through dialogue and&#13;
negotiation with communities, technical advise and by incorporating special features into the design&#13;
of specific sub-projects. It can be seen that the Project also presents possibilities for promoting sub-&#13;
projects or sub-project components that could in fact have a positive impact on the environment. In&#13;
this case, care would be taken not to impose activities or solutions on communities, but rather to&#13;
present them with a range of options and information on what other communities have already tried&#13;
and succeeded at.&#13;
16.    Because the Project may have specific environmental impacts of a limited nature, it is&#13;
judged that the appropriate environmental categoryfor the project is category "B", in accordance&#13;
with the World Bank's Operation Directive number 4.01 on Environmental Assessment. In the&#13;
context of a project of this nature, however, where the specific activities of the ECDF cannot be&#13;
determined with any accuracy before the start of operations, there is limited scope to define the&#13;
measures to be taken on the ground to mitigate potentially negative environmental impacts. This&#13;
analysis is thus limited to: (a) flagging potential problem areas; and (b) ensuring that appraisal and&#13;
monitoring functions of the ECDF are designed in such a way to ensure that each sub-project is&#13;
properly assessed and monitored for potential environmental effects and dealt with on a case&#13;
specific basis.&#13;
17.    Capacity Building. The key to ensuring that sub-projects will be environmentally sound&#13;
and that positive actions can be taken, where appropriate, to promote better environmental&#13;
management, is the building up of capacity of ECDF staff and of village level representatives&#13;
responsible for project implementation. A number of measures will be necessary to this end. First,&#13;
there would be a need to establish systematic procedures to adequately screen, appraise and monitor&#13;
micro-projects. Secondly there would be the need to train ECDF staff to apply these procedures&#13;
effectively. Although staff of the ECDF are already technically competent and aware of potential&#13;
environmental effects of various development activities, they have little experience in applying&#13;
rigorous environmental assessment procedures to project appraisal processes. The Capacity&#13;
Building program would include targeted training for ECDF staff in the Management Office and in&#13;
the Regional Branches. Thirdly, community members would need to be part of the process of&#13;
translating environmental objectives into actions through practical training and provision of&#13;
technical advice.&#13;
18.    An environment focal point would be appointed in the Management Office to: (i) maintain&#13;
responsibility for environmental training and up-dating of the Environment Handbook; and (b)&#13;
serve as contact point for the Eritrean Agency for Environment.. Moreover, the existing ECDF staff&#13;
would be trained to integrate appropriate environmental approaches into their mainstream activities.&#13;
19.    Screening and AppraisaL The process by which sub-projects would be screened,&#13;
appraised and approved, would be designed in such a way that potential negative environmental&#13;
impacts or other environmental issues could be identified at an early stage and adequate measures&#13;
taken to modify the project design or undertake other mitigating actions in consultation with the&#13;
communities concerned. Primary responsibility for assessing the environmental impact of micro-&#13;
projects would rest with the Regional Branches Project Officers. In cases where a project is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 6 of 6&#13;
thought to have a number of environmental issues to resolve, it would be the responsibility of the&#13;
Project Officer to discuss these issues with the community and arrive at a satisfactory conclusion&#13;
before the project is transmitted to the Management Office for review. If necessary the Project&#13;
Officer could flag issues of a technically complex nature to be followed up by the Management&#13;
Office.&#13;
20.   Environmental Assessment Handbook In order to assist Project Officers in the&#13;
screening and appraisal process, a concise environmental assessment handbook would be prepared&#13;
including checklists that would help Project Officers to identify potential environmental issues and&#13;
propose appropriate mitigating actions. The handbook would be prepared by consultants at the&#13;
earliest stages of the Project and be used initially for the training of ECDF staff. It is estimated that&#13;
four weeks of a team of national and international consultants would be necessary to complete the&#13;
handbook.&#13;
21.   Training of ECDF Staff. The training to be provided to ECDF staff would be broad based&#13;
and would have the purpose of providing staff, particularly at the regional level, with a general&#13;
understanding of the purpose and process of environmental assessment across the various&#13;
categories of activities being undertaken by the ECDF and to equip them with the skills to identify&#13;
potential environmental problems and propose appropriate mitigating actions. It is anticipated that&#13;
one initial basic training session of two to three days would be required with possibly one refresher&#13;
training session to be held at a later stage of the project cycle. The participants would be technical&#13;
staff of the Management Office and Regional Branches of ECDF. Its duration would be 2/3 days.&#13;
22.   Training at the Community LeveL Training at the community level would be aimed at&#13;
members of the village development committees and village baitos. The training would be&#13;
undertaken by staff of ECDF who would use specific sub-projects as the entry point for their&#13;
interventions. Such training would be very pragmatic and focused on presenting community&#13;
members with practical advice on ways of coping with environmental issues that impinge on their&#13;
daily life. Training would be of a short-term nature and spread over the lifetime of the project.&#13;
Care would be taken to avoid lecturing communities on bad environmental practices, concentrating&#13;
instead on identifying options and solutions for everyday problems.&#13;
23.   Monitoring and Evaluation. It would be important that an appropriate monitoring system&#13;
be established to ensure that environmental concerns are appropriately incorporated into the sub-&#13;
projects. During the initial stages of sub-project appraisal and design, there would need to be a&#13;
strong reliance on the skill and commitment of Project Officers to identify relevant environmental&#13;
issues and to monitor that those responsible for designing and implementing the different sub-&#13;
projects undertake the necessary studies or other technical activities necessary to deal with the&#13;
issues identified. The ECDF MIS system would support the task by including a provision for the&#13;
classification of each sub-project according to its environmental impact (e.g. category A - negative&#13;
impact; category B - negative but able to be mitigated; category C - environmentally benign;&#13;
category D - environmentally positive), together with of a brief description of the issues of concern.&#13;
Although care would be taken not to overburden the ECDF staff or community representatives&#13;
with too many functions or responsibilities, a number of basic indicators would be identified to&#13;
enable staff to keep track of whether the environmental issues identified are being appropriately&#13;
pursued and to evaluate whether or not the appraisal process as a whole is resulting in&#13;
environmentally sound projects on the ground. These indicators would also be incorporated into&#13;
the MIS system.&#13;

Education and Health Sector Related Projects&#13;
I.    Premises. The following factors have been taken into account to determine the volume&#13;
of activities that ECDF would implement in the education and health sector: (i) anticipated&#13;
number of community-initiated proposals and related cost; (ii) preparation and monitoring&#13;
capacity a the Regional Branches level; (iii) local construction capacity; and, (iv) acceptable&#13;
share of the available annual ECDF Budget based on sectoral priorities for the country and the&#13;
regions. During the past two years, the pilot Fund has completed 34 elementary schools. Sixteen&#13;
elementary schools are in the 1995 project pipeline and included in the preliminary planning and&#13;
budgeting. It is expected that accepted proposals in the period 1996-2001 would number about&#13;
20 per year, a figure that is considered in line with the implementing capacity of the construction&#13;
sector. In the health sector the pilot Fund has completed in the past two years 17 health stations&#13;
and 9 health centres. It is expected that the annual number of qualifying requests for the period&#13;
1996-2001 exceed the 1995 work volume. It is not expected that local construction capacity be a&#13;
limiting factor. The projections proposed in this annex are based on the standard models (for&#13;
both health and education infrastructure) for convenience purpose, but the size and structure of&#13;
each facility would be individually decided on the basis of the catchment-population, and other&#13;
relevant factors.&#13;
2.    Education Infrastructure: Elementary School. A standard elementary school&#13;
comprises 6 classrooms, I staff/meeting room, I office, I store room, I six-unit teachers'&#13;
residence, I eight-unit dry latrine block. Based on the price levels experienced during the pilot&#13;
phase, the average cost per standard 6-classroom elementary school (total area 505 m ),&#13;
including latrines, staff accommodation, and furniture, amounts to US$ 82,500 for the highlands&#13;
and US$ 90,000 for the lowlands. Assuming a highland-lowland ratio of 1:4 as in the pilot&#13;
phase, the overall average cost would amount to US$ 88,500 (average 1995 price level). If the&#13;
standard dry pit latrine is exchanged (as recommended) for 2 number 5-cubicle VIP latrines, the&#13;
cost is expected to increase by US$ 500. The inclusion of a sizeable (30 mi3) underground rain&#13;
water collection tank, including gutters and pipe work, adds US$ 3,500 to the cost of a school.&#13;
Therefore, the total costfor one improved standard school should be US$ 92,500. For budget&#13;
purposes, this price is increased by US$ 1,500 a year to cover inflation.&#13;
3.    Junior Secondary School. A junior secondary school is estimated to cost&#13;
approximately 11% per square metre more than the elementary school. The total cost of a&#13;
standard junior secondary school is estimated at US $ 280,500 (average 1995 price level),&#13;
including furniture. The building includes 20 classrooms, 1 library plus laboratory block, 1&#13;
administration block, 2 six-unit teachers' residences and 3 pit latrine blocks (total area 1455 m2&#13;
and modifications in the plans to include VIP-latrines (3 times 2 blocks) and 2 rain water&#13;
reservoirs, gutters and pipe work, are estimated to cost US $ 8,500 extra. The total cost of one&#13;
improvedjunior secondary school would be US$ 289,000. For budgeting purposes, this price is&#13;
increased by US$ 4,500 a year to cover inflation..&#13;
4.    The budget for the education sub-project is based on a work volume equivalent to more&#13;
than 70 standard elementary schools with ancillary facilities, such as staff quarters and improved&#13;
sanitation, water storage and furniture. Since the MOE has flexible construction standards,&#13;
which take into account the catchment student population and other variable factors, it is&#13;
expected that the final number of infrastructure will be about 100, among school buildings of&#13;
different size and construction techniques.&#13;

S.     Health Infrastructure: Health Station. The standard health station consists of the&#13;
clinic building, a dry latrine block, a health staff residence, an elevated water tank, and an&#13;
underground water reservoir. Based on the pilot phase, the average cost per standard health&#13;
station (total built-up area 251 m2), comprising I four-unit health staff residence, I six-unit dry&#13;
latrine block, an elevated water tank, and an underground water reservoir, but not including&#13;
furniture, is US$ 67,000 for the highlands and US$ 77,000 for the lowlands. Assuming a&#13;
highland-lowland ratio of 1:4 as in the pilot phase, the overall average cost amounts to US$&#13;
75,000 (average 1995 price levels). If the water supply/catchment reservoir and the sanitation&#13;
systems can be rationalised, it is estimated that the extra cost incurred for construction of a larger&#13;
rain water catchment reservoir is equivalent to the omission of the elevated water tank. The&#13;
small additional cost for providing 2 three-unit VIP latrine blocks (male/female, each with 2&#13;
units for patients and I unit for staff) and for a medical waste/placenta pit with cover is&#13;
equivalent to the omission of internal flush toilets. The cost of the furniture and the solar-&#13;
powered refrigerator, which so far was never included in the project cost, is estimated to be 10%&#13;
of the construction cost. The total cost for one improved standard health station would be US$&#13;
82,500 (1995 price level). For budget purposes an annual increase of US$ 1,250 is foreseen to&#13;
cover inflation.&#13;
6.     Health Centre. The standard health centre, consisting of the centre building, I six-unit&#13;
dry latrine block, and I four-unit staff residence, costs US$ 245,000 in the highlands and US$&#13;
341,000 in the lowlands. Population densities in the highlands more easily justify the&#13;
establishment of a health centre than in the more sparsely populated lowlands. For budget&#13;
reasons, the ratio highland-lowland is assumed to be 1:1. The average cost per health centre is&#13;
US$ 293,000 not including furniture. As for the health station, it is estimated that rationalisation&#13;
of the water, sanitation and waste disposal systems can take place in a cost-neutral way. The&#13;
cost of furniture and solar powered refrigerator is estimated to be 10% of the construction cost,&#13;
or US$ 29,300. The total costfor one improved health centre would be US$ 322,300 (1995 price&#13;
level). For budget reasons, this price is increased by US$ 5,000 per year to cover inflation.&#13;
7.     The budget for the health sector is based on a work volume of more than 70 among&#13;
standard health stations and centers with ancillary facilities, such as staff quarters and improved&#13;
sanitation, water storage, furniture and solar power refrigerator. Since the standards of MOH are&#13;
flexible, and take into account variables such as the catchment population to determine the size&#13;
of the facilities, it is expected that ECDF will finance a larger number of facilities (about 100).&#13;

8.    Implementation Arrangements.. ECDF's experience with implementation has mainly&#13;
been with labour-only contracts with local contractors, community participation in cash, labour&#13;
and/or materials, procurement of materials by the Fund, and hired transport for delivery of&#13;
materials. The involvement in the procurement and the responsibility for the delivery of&#13;
materials has become a heavy burden for the ECDF. To reduce the work load in this field, it is&#13;
foreseen that in the expanded phase a substantial amount of the civil works contracts would be&#13;
turn-key contracts. The contractors would not only provide labour, but also purchase, transport&#13;
and store materials, and be responsible for site organisation and construction management.&#13;
9.     Project Management and Supervision In the pilot phase, the Provincial ECRF Sub-&#13;
unit, often in close collaboration with the Reconstruction and Development Division and the&#13;
Provincial Engineer, carried out the regular supervision, evaluation and handing-over visits to&#13;
the construction sites. As soon as the number of turn-key contracts increases, the need will grow&#13;
to supervise closely and undertake timely evaluations. This is due to the nature of the contracting&#13;
business, where cash liquidity to buy materials and pay wages is important. The increasing work&#13;
load for Regional Branches Project Officers, supervisors and quantity surveyors may necessitate&#13;
the involvement (or hiring) of additional expertise. This expertise might be found at district&#13;
level for daily supervision, or at regional or national level for evaluations and progress&#13;
monitoring, and quality control.&#13;
10.   Community Involvement. During the pilot, the community's involvement has been&#13;
mainly in terms of contributions towards the construction (labour, materials and cash), but&#13;
sometimes the community took an active part in the management of project materials and the site&#13;
organisation. If supervising capacity can be found locally, the community would be able to play&#13;
a role in the daily supervision. It is also possible that, in addition to the community's&#13;
contribution, local labour (and/or craftsmen) is hired by the contractor of a turn-key project.&#13;
I.    There is a large range of implementation options. The following box summarises&#13;
potential roles and responsibilities for each implementing agent:&#13;

- monitoring only, all supervision by community&#13;
12.    Education and Health Training Activities. The Fund would facilitate non-&#13;
infrastructure initiatives related to education and health. Elementary or middle school facilities,&#13;
as well as health stations and health centres, can cater to additional social functions. Adult&#13;
education, literacy classes, environmental health, conservation, public sanitation, community&#13;
mobilisation are amongst possible community interests. The Fund would also consider financing&#13;
training costs, relevant documentation, reference and training literature, instruction aids, and&#13;
other activities and items aimed at building knowledge and skills in the community (for example&#13;
in the fields of marketable basic crafts, first aid, homestead cultivation and husbandry, business&#13;
skills, and the like). For basic social non-infrastructure training projects, it is assumed that there&#13;
would be a gradual increase in requests, as the possibilities to use the Fund for this purpose&#13;
become known and the benefits visible.&#13;

Rural Water Supply&#13;
I.     Background. On the basis of proposals received during the pilot phase, and needs&#13;
assessments carried out during the preparation of the expanded project, it is estimated that ECDF&#13;
would provide improved drinking water supply to more than 230 communities representing&#13;
about 5% of the rural population. The total cost of the rural water supply component is&#13;
estimated at US $ 4.15 million. The water supply component of ECDF would (i) rehabilitate&#13;
and/or augment existing supplies, and (ii) develop new supplies. Rehabilitation is an important&#13;
element of the component as a large number of existing systems (40-50%) are inoperative due to&#13;
inadequate maintenance. Most water supplies are currently unprotected. The construction of&#13;
new supplies would primarily consist of three major typologies (Table 1) - hand dug wells&#13;
(49%), drilled wells (40%) and piped water supplies (5%). These represent the most common&#13;
technological solutions, however, in exceptional cases and only where these schemes would not&#13;
be technically feasible, other alternatives (6%) sub-project typologies would be considered.&#13;

2.     Actual costs of each proposed typology would vary from one scheme to another&#13;
depending on topographical and hydrogeological characteristics, population size, and settlement&#13;
patterns. It is intended that the Government will standardize handpumps in the near future.&#13;
Mark II handpumps will be phased out and Mark III handpumps will become the standard&#13;
VLOM (Village Level Operation and Maintenance) pump. Mono-handpumps and motorized&#13;
pumps will also be used.&#13;

3.     Hand Dug Wells. Traditional hand dug wells in Eritrea are generally quite shallow.&#13;
Over 71% are estimated to be less than 5 meters deep. It is proposed that hand dug wells of up to&#13;
25 meters be considered by ECDF. Hand dug wells are typically constructed by communities.&#13;
Technical assistance may only be required for headworks and installation of handpumps. Bucket&#13;
lifts could also be installed where yields are not adequate. Costs of fitting handpumps on&#13;
existing hand dug wells are estimated to be about 60% of the full cost of a hand dug well.&#13;
Table 4 Unit Cost for Hand-Dug Well&#13;
Hand Dug Well:              Unit Costs (Birr)&#13;
Labor and materials                   31,000&#13;
Equipment handpump                    10,000&#13;
Supervision/software                   2,500&#13;
Total Cost                            42,500&#13;
4.     The calculation of this unit cost is based on the following assumptions:&#13;
- depth (average)                                15 meters&#13;
- population served                              250&#13;
- skills available within proximity of community  Yes&#13;
- estimated implementation time                  7 months&#13;
- handpump                                       Mark III&#13;
- per capita investment                          170&#13;
5.   Drilled Wells. Drilled wells of between 40 and 70 meters would be fitted with hand&#13;
pumps. Community participation in siting is essential and could also involve construction of&#13;
headworks and fencing. Inadequate hydrogeological information could result in a high failure&#13;
rate (dry wells). -There are presently 10 drilling rigs in the country (6 within Government)&#13;
capable of drilling an estimated 450 boreholes per year. The average annual drilling requirement&#13;
of the ECDF is about 20 boreholes per year.&#13;
Table 5 Unit Cost for Drilled Well&#13;
Drilled Well                        Unit Costs (Birr)&#13;

Total Cost                               90,000&#13;
6.     The calculation of this unit cost is based on the following assumptions:&#13;
- depth (average)                                55 meters&#13;
- population                                     500*&#13;
- estimated implementation time                  6 months&#13;
- handpump                                       Mark III&#13;
- per capita cost                                180 Birr&#13;
7.     Piped Water Supplies. On a per capita cost basis, piped water supplies would be most&#13;
suitable for communities of 3000 and above. Construction costs for a scheme consisting of a&#13;
hand dug (15-25) or drilled well (40-70m), motorized pump, 50m3 reservoir, distribution&#13;
network of 2000 meters, 4 distribution points and 2 livestock watering points is estimated to cost&#13;
190 Birr per capita for a community of 3000 persons. Distribution points would be located&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex K&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
within proximity of social infrastructure (clinics and education facilities) and troughs for&#13;
livestock watering at the outskirts of the community. Costs of augmenting existing supplies by&#13;
constructing distribution networks are about 14% less than new piped supplies.&#13;
Table 6 Unit Cost for Piped Water Supply&#13;

- Labor - trench excavation and pipe fitting  200,000&#13;
- equipment  motorized pump                 106,000&#13;

- 4 distribution points and 2 cattle troughs  22,000&#13;
- pumphouse                                  31,000&#13;
Total Cost                                  571,000&#13;
8.     This unit cost is based on the following assumptions:&#13;
- population                              3000&#13;
- estimated implementation time           17 months&#13;
- length of distribution network (average)  2000 meters&#13;
- per capita cost                         190 Birr&#13;
- motorized pump                          mono-pump with lister engine&#13;
9.     Operation and Maintenance Arrangements. In considering the development of new&#13;
sources, as well as in the appraisal of rehabilitation of existing schemes, previous initiatives&#13;
taken by communities to operate, maintain and improve the management of their schemes would&#13;
be taken into consideration. In particular, efforts to collect revenue for operation and&#13;
maintenance would be reviewed and built upon. Where operation and maintenance funds are not&#13;
customarily collected, communities would be required to establish an operation and maintenance&#13;
fund and collect a minimum 10% of the annual O&amp;M cost of the ECDF financed sub-project as a&#13;
pre-condition before sub-project appraisal.&#13;
10.    The role of the Government in providing technical support to communities for operation&#13;
and maintenance would decline over the project period. The Water Resources Department which&#13;
currently has full responsibility for operation and maintenance of piped water supplies and&#13;
handpumps would be phasing out this support over several years as and when adequate capacity&#13;
for operation and maintenance is built up. The establishment of Technical Teams at the sub-&#13;
zonal level comprised of 5 trained individuals (possibly from the private sector) has been&#13;
proposed by the Government. Communities would pay for intermediate or major repairs to be&#13;
carried out by these teams whenever necessary. The Government will finalize its strategy on this&#13;
and other key operation and maintenance issues at a National Meeting on Operation and&#13;
Maintenance of Water Supply and Sanitation to be held in late 1995/early 1996.&#13;
11.   Implementation Capacity. Lack of information on water resources, particularly&#13;
hydrogeological data is likely to cause some difficulties in developing groundwater sources in&#13;
the short term. Reliance on groundwater sources is further complicated by pastoral activities in&#13;
the lowlands, and settlement patterns in the highlands - Villages are commonly situated on&#13;
hilltops above farming areas. A hydrogeological study to be carried out by with EU support will&#13;
substantially improve the availability of information on groundwater, and difficulties caused by&#13;
inadequate geophysical siting and ariilling capacity will decrease as private sector capacity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex K&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
grows. There are currently 10 drilling rigs in Eritrea of which 6 are in the Ministry of Energy,&#13;
Mines and Water Resources. All rigs are based in Asmara. As part of its reform program, WRD&#13;
has transferred its drilling equipment to a newly formed drilling parastatal company which will&#13;
provide drilling services on a competitive basis. The capacity of the private sector to undertake&#13;
civil works has been demonstrated in the pilot ECRF. However due to difficulties in procuring&#13;
necessary materials and equipment, it is anticipated that there may be some implementation&#13;
difficulties. To help alleviate these constraints, it is proposed that procurement assistance and&#13;
training be provided to the private sector.&#13;
12.    Capacity Building. A key element of the water component of ECDF would be capacity&#13;
building support for communities, institutions such ECDF staff, MOLG, and WRD, and private&#13;
sector institutions involved in the implementation of the sub-projects. Technical assistance to&#13;
supporting agencies would ensure that communities have the capacity to participate in sub-&#13;
projects during project implementation and after project completion. The establishment of&#13;
effective District Technical Teams, to provide backup maintenance support to communities,&#13;
would also contribute to this objective. Capacity building would be provided at four different&#13;
levels: (i) national; (ii) provincial and district; (iii) community/village water committee; and (iv)&#13;
private sector.&#13;
13.   Implementation Arrangements. Implementation arrangements for water sub-projects&#13;
will be somewhat different from those in other sectors. As communities are expected to be&#13;
responsible for the full recurrent costs of their schemes, they must be involved in project&#13;
planning, design, supervision, and operation and maintenance. This will necessitate adequate&#13;
capacity for consultation and involvement of the community, and for providing training in&#13;
operation and maintenance of facilities, including financial and general management to water&#13;
committees. Key steps in the preparation of water sub-projects include community mobilization&#13;
and awareness creation; assessment of community capacity to raise adequate funds to cover&#13;
capital contribution and recurrent costs; involvement of communities in technology selection&#13;
including discussion of operation and maintenance requirements of different technology options;&#13;
reaching agreement on cost-sharing arrangements - including the option of increasing the&#13;
community contribution if a higher level of service is selected; reviewing options for&#13;
institutional support to the community - including the role of NGOs, local government, the&#13;
private sector, and others.&#13;

Rural Roads And Transport Component&#13;
1.    The Road Network. The road network of Eritrea has been estimated in various reports to&#13;
measure more than 6,000 km in length including about 4500 km of seasonal, or dry weather rural feeder&#13;
roads distributed throughout the six regions. The Road Transport and Construction Department (RTD)&#13;
of the Ministry of Construction (MOC) is currently preparing a road inventory summary showing road&#13;
length by class, surface type and condition. Preliminary summaries covering a total of about 4,250 km&#13;
of what may be termed the classified road network. have been prepared in November 1994. The roads&#13;
are functionally classified into primary, secondary, local and minor, and described by four road&#13;
(surface) types, namely, paved, gravel, earth and roads essentially considered "tracks". It is significant&#13;
to note that about 14% of Secondary roads and about 86 percent of the Local roads may now be&#13;
considered tracks.&#13;
Table 1 Length of Classified Roads by Surface Type (Kmi)&#13;

2      Road Network Condition. The condition of the overall road network is generally poor or very&#13;
poor, and it is expected to be worse than the summary of classified roads condition presented in Table&#13;
2. Only 5 percent may be described as being in good condition, while about 80 percent are in poor or&#13;
very poor condition.&#13;

3.     Lessons from the Pilot Community Rehabilitation Fund. During the Pilot phase, the ECRF&#13;
implemented the following sub-projects in the road rehabilitation sector: (i) rehabilitation of a 5 km&#13;
section of the 42-km IndaGeorgis-Maimne feeder road; (ii) a bridge on the road to Adi Hawisha off a&#13;
junction about 13 km along the Asmara-Decemere road; (iii) a bridge near Tsada Christian; and (iv) two&#13;
fords or river crossings at Adi Neamn (45 km from Asmara). The road was constructed by using labor,&#13;
tools and some material inputs from the beneficiary communities. The Provincial Road Transport&#13;
Construction Branch (PRTCB) provided technical assistance and limited equipment support. The road&#13;
serves about 40 communities with an estimated beneficiary population of 48,000. Though feeder roads&#13;
rehabilitation has been a relatively minor activity for the Pilot ECRF, it has demonstrated that it is&#13;
feasible to carry out feeder roads and bridge improvement by using domestic private contractors, and&#13;
involving communities, and local administrations. The expanded ECDF would complete road&#13;
improvement initiatives (which focus on the classified rural road network) by supporting improvements&#13;
to levels of transport service below that provided by all-weather roads and motor vehicles. ECDF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex L&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
would be used for testing (i) community participation processes, as well as (ii) environmental protection&#13;
measures for RRT infrastructure including traditional tracks and trails used by donkeys, camels,&#13;
bicycles, and animal drawn carts.&#13;
4.     The Pilot phase has also shown that the implementation of rural road interventions will require&#13;
technical support for design and supervision from MOLG or ECDF, the Regional Administrations, and&#13;
the Roads and Transportation Department (RTD). Low technical capacity for design and supervision,&#13;
however, remains an important issue to address for the whole road sector. Capacity of the RTD and its&#13;
branches are being built up and strengthened for the management, supervision and execution of road&#13;
sector programs. There is also a need to build up capacity at the regional and local levels. The&#13;
grassroots institutional basis for developing and implementing an expanded community supported rural&#13;
roads and transport program already exists. The expanded ECDF program, therefore, would provide a&#13;
good vehicle for testing various implementation modalities. Evaluation of these modalities would&#13;
provide information for preparing a rural road and transport mid-term strategy.&#13;
5.    Implementation Modalities. The ECDF would employ private contractors to execute the&#13;
feeder road improvement works except in remote locations where the capacity may be low or non-&#13;
existent. In such locations, the ECDF would contract the roadworks out to Construction Units in the&#13;
regional administrations. At present, only Denkel province has a Construction Unit. There are up to&#13;
133 contractors registered with the Ministry of Construction. Most contractors are registered as&#13;
building contractors, and some masons and other artisans are available, and they can be contracted for&#13;
the construction of the box culverts and river crossings. With training, most of the contractors can&#13;
execute the road works using labor-based techniques. The ECDF would carry out a contractor survey to&#13;
determine the numbers and availability of contractors for the works in the various regions, as well as&#13;
their training and capacity building needs, before the beginning of the expanded phase. This exercise&#13;
would be part of initial capacity building activities.&#13;
6.     A register for consultants, professional engineers and architects, graduate engineers and&#13;
architects, engineering aides and associate engineering aides has been established for construction&#13;
works, structural engineering, surveying and drafting. ECDF would advertise its proposed program in&#13;
order to record and register potential consultants for interview and recruitment for the program.&#13;
Consultants, especially for roads and bridges survey and design, would be recruited to support ECDF&#13;
staff.&#13;
7.     RRT improvements providing levels of service below that provided by all-weather roads and&#13;
motor vehicles could be implemented by the beneficiary communities themselves, usually (but not&#13;
necessarily) with the assistance of intermediaries (such as NGOs). The same applies to all-weather&#13;
local access roads and tracks which do not meet national standards. Rural road improvements which are&#13;
intended to meet national standards would be implemented by, in order of preference, (i) labor-based&#13;
contractors; (ii) labor-based force account units of the PRTCB (Provincial Road Transport&#13;
Construction Branch); (iii) equipment-based contractors; and (iv) equipment-based units of PRTCB.&#13;
Where beneficiary communities are contributing to the sub-project cost by providing free labor,&#13;
implementation may be done by labor-based units of PRTCB in order to avoid possible exploitation by&#13;
contractors. In the case of spot improvements and staged-development of rural transport routes which&#13;
are expected to be eventually taken over and upgraded to national rural road standards by the PRTCB,&#13;
the alignments selected and structures built should meet the requirements of the responsible PRTCB.&#13;
Possible packages of institutional responsibilities for the implementation of the six types of RRT&#13;
improvements are given in Attachment A.&#13;
8.     Maintenance Modalities: Pre-conditions. The maintenance of rural roads improved by the&#13;
project would not be carried out unless it is: (i) adequately funded; (ii) properly organized and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex L&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
programmed; (iii) properly supervised; and (iv) the responsibilities of the various parties are clearly set&#13;
out and agreed. ECDF Project Officers would ensure that all of these pre-conditions for effective&#13;
maintenance are met before the road proposal is appraised. Wherever possible, improved rural roads&#13;
should be maintained by labor-intensive methods employing labor from the communities along the&#13;
road. It is unreasonable to expect people to work regularly on road maintenance (albeit part-time)&#13;
without payment, and maintenance workers should receive fair compensation for their efforts, either as&#13;
contractors or as employees.&#13;
9.     Methods: The following common methods of labor-intensive routine maintenance of roads&#13;
would be implemented: (i) by single-man contractors or lengthmen, each of whom is responsible for&#13;
keeping a short section of road (usually 1-2 km) up to a certain standard and is paid by results; (ii)&#13;
length-gangs, as in (i) but, with groups of 4 or 5 people, under gang leaders, maintaining 6-10 km&#13;
sections of road; (iii) section contracts, where clearly defined maintenance responsibilities for&#13;
substantial lengths of road are put out to contract, preferably on a lump sum basis but possibly on the&#13;
basis of unit rates for various tasks; (iv) village contracts, as above but where maintenance contracts&#13;
are given to village administrations; (v)functional contracts, whereby contractors carry out specific&#13;
tasks, according to need or season (e.g. grass cutting, drain and culvert clearing, carriageway repairs,&#13;
etc.) and are paid on a lump sum basis; (vi)force account road maintenance by gangs operating out of&#13;
road camps or depots, but this is the least effective or desirable option.&#13;
10.    Most of the above-mentioned maintenance methods are applicable, to a greater or lesser extent,&#13;
to community roads and can be adapted to suit local circumstances. For example, village contracts can&#13;
be tumed into inter-village agreements. The maintenance method adopted for particular sections of&#13;
road would be determined after considering: (i) the availability of labor along the road; (ii) local&#13;
preferences for working as individuals or in groups; (iii) the availability of competent contractors; and&#13;
(iv) the willingness and competence of village administrations to take on road maintenance contracts.&#13;
Possible packages of institutional responsibilities for maintenance of the assets created under the six&#13;
types of RRT improvements are given in Attachment A.&#13;
11.    Environmental Protection. The proposed rural road improvements satisfy conditions under&#13;
Environmental Category B by virtue of their concentration on spot improvements, rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance of existing rural roads, their exclusion of rural road improvements which involve&#13;
significant amounts of realignment or new construction, as well as the emphasis given to appropriate&#13;
environmental protection measures. A detailed checklist for mitigating the adverse effects on the&#13;
environment would be included in the Operational Manual, on the basis of the following principles:&#13;
(i)    The ECDF RRT component should serve as a testing ground and as a training/demonstration&#13;
facility for environmental protection measures for RRT improvements. This would entail not&#13;
only carrying out normal environmental protection measures within the road/track reserve but&#13;
also rectifying (or at least halting) previous environmental damage and extending&#13;
environmental protection measures beyond the road/track reserve to ensure that the RRT&#13;
improvements do not cause environmental problems elsewhere, especially downstream of&#13;
rivers.&#13;
(ii)    Every effort should be made to minimize adverse environmental impact from RRT&#13;
improvements in villages by providing adequate drainage and safety for pedestrians.&#13;
12.    Technical Assistance, Training and Capacity Building. The RRT component would require&#13;
a substantial amount of capacity building and training (especially as regards labor-based works) which&#13;
should focus on the following players and activities:-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

-     on-the-job training in labor-based implementation and maintenance methods for gang&#13;
leaders/headmen and workers.&#13;
13.   The training in labor-intensive/labor-based methods would comprise classroom and on-the-job&#13;
training for selected works supervisors/foremen and engineers from ECDF, PRTCB and other&#13;
implementing agencies.&#13;
14.   Technical assistance for a total of 18 man-months would also be provided through support&#13;
(comprising intermittent visits of three months on average, but not exceeding six months per tour by&#13;
experts recruited through the ILO/ASIST (based in Harare and Nairobi) to train a mobile team of&#13;
trainers to provide the various forms of training needed by beneficiary. The aim would be to build on&#13;
the experience already available in the country and the training could be provided by the ECDF itself&#13;
after the engineer has received training as above, or through a competent NGO, or consultant with&#13;
similar experience.&#13;

The Pilot Savings and Credit Program&#13;
1.    Background. There are an estimated 247,000 people working in informal sector&#13;
activities in Eritreat, many of which belong to the 80% of households that are involved in small-&#13;
scale agriculture. These micro-entrepreneurs lack access to the needed resources to invest in&#13;
their enterprises. To assess their needs, the Income Generating Committee set up within the pilot&#13;
Community Rehabilitation Fund completed a comprehensive nation-wide survey of income-&#13;
generating activities, using a questionnaire at the household, community, district, and zonal&#13;
levels. A separate study was undertaken of Ekubs, a traditional, informal village savings&#13;
mechanism found mainly in the highlands and which operates similarly to the group-based&#13;
lending system proposed in the program. The study indicates that while the major source of&#13;
livelihood in the interior is tied to agriculture and pastoralism, a large number of agriculture-&#13;
related and off-farm economic activities were identified in each region.&#13;
2.   Objectives and Priorities. The goal of ECDF's pilot Savings and Credit Program will be&#13;
to demonstrate the effectiveness of institution-building efforts aimed at creating new income and&#13;
employment in poor communities and at contributing to the improvement of living standards and&#13;
to increased overall prosperity of these communities. This goal will be achieved through:&#13;
(a)   Developing the capacity of Village Administrations to manage a village-based&#13;
Savings and Credit Program that will deliver needed financial services to target&#13;
beneficiaries.&#13;
(b)  Developing the capacity of ECDF to manage a large-scale, cost-effective,&#13;
financially rigorous micro-credit program.&#13;
(c)   Providing credit to the income-generating activities of substantial numbers of&#13;
Eritreans.&#13;
(d)  Reaching women, the poor, and those living in isolated towns and villages, making&#13;
use of both their entrepreneurial capacity and their sense of responsibility.&#13;
(e)   Creating the basis for a permanent, self-sustaining Savings and Credit institution&#13;
that will serve an expanding number of communities after the completion of the&#13;
ECDF program.&#13;
3.   The Program Model. One of the most interesting innovations of the last two decades has&#13;
been the emergence of programs that have assisted the informal businesses of some of the&#13;
poorest residents of a country, by the thousands, hundreds of thousands, and even millions (in the&#13;
case of the Grameen Bank), while covering most of their operating costs through the interest and&#13;
fees charged on loans. These programs are based on the creation of autonomously functioning&#13;
"village banks," typically with 30 to 50 members. The "banks", which elect their own officers,&#13;
create their bylaws, manage their loan funds, and review and approve loan requests, have proved&#13;
to be virtually the only types of business assistance programs that:&#13;
(a)   Reached truly substantial numbers of the rural and urban poor, especially women.&#13;
Loans are uncollateralized and do not require co-signers, or land titles or other&#13;
securities, which insures that the poor participate.&#13;
1 A report prepared by the Ministry of Trade and Industry in May, 1995 estimates that these 247,000 people&#13;
working as owners and employees support 1. 1 million people. These figures exclude unestimated handicrafts&#13;
in the urban and rural areas, construction and transport, which would make these estimates much higher.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex M&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
(b)  Provided a step-by-step approach to enterprise development, starting with very&#13;
small loans, issued quickly so that a business can start making a productive&#13;
investment, and progressing in steps to loans of several hundred dollars.&#13;
(c)  Produced impressive results in terms of generating new income, which then&#13;
translated into improved nutrition and better housing, education and health care,&#13;
especially when assistance was directed to women.&#13;
(d)  Proved to be an excellent organizational platform for introducing simple notions of&#13;
business literacy, and other services such as basic health education for women,&#13;
where the messages are reinforced by the cohesive structure that emerges in the&#13;
group. These services can often be provided by other agencies at no additional cost&#13;
to the program.&#13;
(e)  Encouraged the formation of village-run collective businesses, such as grain storage&#13;
facilities, financed by the savings and interest income mobilized from the members.&#13;
(f)   Achieved a consistently high loan repayment rate of at least 95%, and more&#13;
typically of 98%. One of the basic tenants of this model is that continued access to&#13;
credit depends on the village bank canceling its entire debt to the intermediary, so&#13;
group support and pressure insures high loan repayment.&#13;
(g)  Have proved to be an effective mechanism of mobilizing local savings that can&#13;
gradually supplant the need for the injection of outside capital into the loan fund.&#13;
(h)  Proved they can pay for the costs of the intermediary promoting the program within&#13;
a few years, if an adequate interest charge is paid on capital made available by the&#13;
intermediary.&#13;
(i)   Have proved to be a powerful tool to free the poorest from the high interest rates&#13;
charged by money lenders.&#13;
4.   Village Banking and the Baitos. Applying lessons learnt from the above models, it is&#13;
proposed that the pilot Savings and Credit Program operate through Village Administration&#13;
Committees or other institution such as NGOs and community development institutions which&#13;
may in the future offer an established capacity to implement program activities. The Village&#13;
Administration Committees are democratically elected and, although there are doubtless great&#13;
variations in capacity, have been found to share a common concern for the development of the&#13;
community, and especially of its more disadvantaged members. It is proposed that the program&#13;
be administered at the village level through a Savings and Credit Unit established by the Village&#13;
Administration and consisting of three members, including: the Village Administration&#13;
Chairperson, a manager responsible for accounts and record keeping, and one other member. At&#13;
least one of the three Unit members will be a woman, in order to insure that women receive a&#13;
representative share of available loan capital. The woman representative will be elected by all&#13;
women in the village.&#13;
5.   The Village Administration Unit will be responsible for: promoting the program within&#13;
the community. They will also be responsible for: (a) orienting and supervising "solidarity&#13;
groups" of five to eight borrowers within the village, who would band together to approve and&#13;
guarantee each other's loans; (b) keeping records on savings and loan payments; and, (c) deal&#13;
with payment problems. Each group would choose its own members and elect its officers. To&#13;
insure that women receive credit early on in the program in each village, at least one of the initial&#13;
groups would be comprised of women. A majority of the first cycle of loans would also go to&#13;
poorer, yet entrepreneurial and responsible, community residents. Further access to credit for&#13;
any member in the group would depend on all members being current with their loans. In&#13;
addition to serving as a guarantee for the loans, the groups would promote mutual support and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex M&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
encouragement as well as develop leadership and management skills. They would also foster&#13;
joint marketing and production in the village.&#13;
6.   If a group missed a payment, the Village Administration Unit would encourage the group&#13;
to pay. If the group could not or would not pay, the Village Administration Unit would be liable&#13;
for the payment, so ECDF could be paid in full. This requirement will ensure that the Village&#13;
Administration Units take seriously their responsibility for prudently managing the program.&#13;
The Unit would review the loan decisions of the groups, keep complete records on loan&#13;
transactions and savings accounts, collect payments and savings from the groups, and deal with&#13;
payment problems that the group couldn't resolve. The Unit would also be the link between the&#13;
local groups and the ECDF Savings and Credit Officer. The Village Administration Unit would&#13;
receive extensive training on program operation, including group formation and training, project&#13;
assessment, and record keeping. This training would also include development by each Village&#13;
Administration Unit of a set of bylaws. The bylaws would establish criteria for selecting village&#13;
members to join the program, along with rules for approving loans, and the actions the Unit&#13;
would take in case of late or non-payment. Solidarity group chairpersons and other community&#13;
leaders would also receive training as the groups emerged. The ECDF Savings and Credit&#13;
Officer would visit village programs on a monthly basis. In addition, the books of each Unit&#13;
would be reviewed by a traveling ECDF auditor twice a year.&#13;
7.   Lending and Savings Activities: Micro-loans. Group members would become eligible&#13;
for loans after having successfully accumulated savings for a period of three months. Initial&#13;
loans could amount to up to Birr 750 per borrowing group member, and would be repaid in 3&#13;
months. Subsequent loan amounts would be increased in steps to, possibly, a maximum of Birr&#13;
1,500, repayable in 6 months; Birr 3,000, repayable in up to one year, and Birr 6,000, repayable&#13;
in up to two years. Receiving the next size loan would be contingent on the group paying the&#13;
previous loans in full.&#13;
8.   Second Tier Loans. While the major thrust of the program would be the micro-loans&#13;
described above, a "second tier" of the program would finance larger (Birr 10,000 to 100,000)&#13;
small business loans that would provide benefits to the entire community for the financing of, for&#13;
example, irrigation pumps, oil extraction presses, grain mills, and small food processing&#13;
installations, as well as other businesses able to generate new employment, such as carpentry&#13;
shops, or tailoring operations. These second-tier loans will provide added flexibility to the S&amp;C&#13;
program by filling gaps in availability of financing for larger, somewhat more formalized&#13;
ventures which would still have no access to commercial bank credit, because of the absence of&#13;
formal banking sector in rural areas. These businesses could be owned individually or&#13;
collectively, but, in contrast to the micro-loans that will be processed through the solidarity&#13;
groups and the Unit, these projects would be only screened initially in the field by the Unit&#13;
together with the regional S&amp;C specialist. They would then be subject to a formal feasibility&#13;
study by the ECDF Management Office, with the involvement of credit specialists from the&#13;
commercial Bank of Eritrea. In order to ensure repayment, equipment and other assets would be&#13;
pledged against the loan. Second-tier loans would be approved only after assessing the strength&#13;
of the program in the applicant's village. To minimize the risk of default, only Village&#13;
Administration Units that have demonstrated good management and repayment in the S&amp;C&#13;
program would be allowed to sponsor second-tier loans.&#13;
9.   Interest Rates. The program's long-term financial sustainability can only be insured if&#13;
borrowers are charged an interest rate which: (a) covers operational costs (including the cost of&#13;
loan defaults); and (b) compensates for the Fund's erosion through inflation. ECDF will make&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex M&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
funds available to Village Administration Units and other institutions at an interest rate sufficient&#13;
to cover the above. At the retail level, Village Administration Units will be free to determine the&#13;
interest rate charged to individual borrowers. Such rate would in any case cover the true cost of&#13;
lending to an economic group with no normal access to commercial credit and which does not fit&#13;
lending conditions applied by formal lending institutions (absence of collateral, high cost of&#13;
lending to very small, widely-dispersed borrowers).2 The above policies are fully consistent with&#13;
policies and regulations applicable to the functioning of financial markets, as confirmed by the&#13;
State Bank of Eritrea.&#13;
10.  Those interested in borrowing would begin by saving through their group for at least six&#13;
months, to demonstrate group solidarity and their commitment to the S&amp;C Program. Potential&#13;
borrowers would be required to save at least 10% of the loan amount before a loan was granted.&#13;
Savers would receive a 5% interest on their deposits (which is competitive with the interest rate&#13;
paid by the Commercial Bank of Eritrea on deposits). The savings of a borrower would be at&#13;
risk in case of default, and would constitute a loan loss reserve on each loan for the Village&#13;
Administration Unit. Those not borrowing would also be encouraged to save, in order to build&#13;
up the local fund and thus lessen, through internally-generated savings, the need for external&#13;
capital provided by ECDF through the loan fund.&#13;
11.  Administration of the Program: Management Office Level. The Savings and Credit&#13;
Central Unit will: (a) develop and perfect the program methodology; (b) be responsible for&#13;
overall management of the loan fund; (c) hire, train and supervise the regional-level staff; (d)&#13;
track program performance at the regional level; and, (e) give final approval of second-tier loans.&#13;
The unit will also contract program advisors, undertake program evaluations, and manage the&#13;
program overall.&#13;
12.  Regional Level. ECDF will staff the program in each region with a Savings and Credit&#13;
Specialist At the beginning of the second year, one Savings and Credit Agent would be hired, if&#13;
necessary, to expand the program within the region. At the beginning of the third year, another&#13;
Agent would be hired. Each Specialist and Agent will serve an average of 15 village banks with&#13;
a total of 750 members. Their chief responsibilities will be to select the Village Administration&#13;
Units that will participate in the program, train and supervise the village banks, and carefully&#13;
monitor the entire program. The Savings and Credit Specialists will be responsible for&#13;
supervising the agents, and making the initial assessment of the second-tier loans in the region.&#13;
13.  Village banks will be ranked on a five-point scale each six months by the ECDF staff and&#13;
by a roving auditor. This ranking will include such variables as the amount lent, the proportion&#13;
of the loans that went to poor women and other poor and vulnerable groups, and loan repayment&#13;
record. Communities that receive the highest rating during the six-month reviews will be&#13;
permitted to expand their loan portfolios rapidly with additional advances from the ECDF Fund.&#13;
Those that receive a very poor rating will be phased out of the program, while those with&#13;
2  The interest rate would be calculated on the basis of the following assumptions: (i) ECDF to village banks&#13;
or other financial intermediaries: 12 percent (intended to cover an estimated inflation rate of 10 percent, plus a&#13;
modest administrative fee of 2 percent); and (ii) Village Bank to final borrower: at a rate to be determined by&#13;
the village bank, but sufficient to fully cover: (a) the cost of the funds (12 percent as above); (b) cost of&#13;
administration of the loan portfolio (taking into account experience with similar programs worldwide); and (c)&#13;
loan loss provision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

intermediate ratings will receive either a reduced advance from ECDF, or will see further&#13;
advances suspended until internal management problems are resolved. Each month, Village&#13;
Administration Units will be advanced funds to meet their projected cash needs, within the limits&#13;
reflecting their rating. The amounts advanced will be determined during monthly visits to each&#13;
Village Administration Unit by ECDF staff. Monthly advances will minimize the risk of storing&#13;
large amounts of unlent cash in areas where banks are not available.&#13;
14.  Program Implementation. The implemenitation projections below reflect an approach to&#13;
expansion of this pilot program that avoids the dual pitfalls of a program growing too rapidly--&#13;
with the strong possibility of the program failing in some areas--, and a program growing so&#13;
cautiously that little of the demand for loans is actually addressed. the following steps are&#13;
foreseen:&#13;
(a)   Starting immediately after Negotiation, ECDF staff will receive intensive training in&#13;
managemenit of the program. At the end of the formal training, detailed program&#13;
procedures and manuals will be tested in select villages, preferably in one or two&#13;
areas near Asmara. The program will only expand modestly in these areas until full&#13;
project financing is available.&#13;
(b)   Once full funding is secured. the pilot program will begin in earnest in three village&#13;
clusters for a two-year period, usin1g the S&amp;C specialists.&#13;
(c)   By the middle of the first year of operations, an additional three regional managers&#13;
will be hired. T hey will be assigned to a six-month apprenticeship in the areas&#13;
where the program is already underway, so that they can fully familiarize&#13;
tihemselves with the program before they are assigned to their own program areas.&#13;
(d)   By the start of the second year, and after the trainees have completed their four-&#13;
month apprenticeship, they will be assigned to three new areas. This will bring the&#13;
total of village clusters served to six.&#13;
(e)   In the second and again in the third year that a region has an operational program, a&#13;
Savings and Credit Agent will be hired to expand the program in the area. Each&#13;
region will thus have a team of three to promote the program, with each one&#13;
responsible for traininig and supervising an average of 15 village banks. Agents&#13;
may be hired from village Administration UJnits members who have demonstrated&#13;
an exceptional level of capacity and commitment to the program.&#13;
15.  Performance Projections. It will take four years. then, for the program to be fully staffed&#13;
with Savings and Credit Specialists and S&amp;C Agents in all six village clusters. The same go-&#13;
slow, purposeful expansion approach will be reflected in the projected expansion of the program&#13;
in a given cluster:&#13;
(a)   S&amp;C activities will be concentrated in a fairly densely populated zone within each&#13;
cluster, in order to minimize logistical problems. It may be necessary to station&#13;
Specialists and Agents in different areas within a regioni to maximize coverage.&#13;
(b)  It is assumed that each Specialist or Agent will select, train and supervise five&#13;
village banks, averaging 50 members each, during their first year of service. They&#13;
will expand the number of village banks they work with to 15 by the end of their&#13;
third year of service.&#13;
16.  By the end of the fifth year of operation in a region, the team of one Specialists and two&#13;
Agents would then be supporting and supervising 45 village banks with approximately 2,250&#13;
members. As the program expands to all six regions, the program would be reaching 270 village&#13;
banks with 13,500 members. In addition to the grouip member loans, the program should have&#13;
funded 90 Tier-2 loans by the end of the fifth year, an average of one per three village banks.&#13;

Gender Action Plan&#13;
I.     Background. Eighty percent of Eritrean women live in rural areas. Many of them have&#13;
limited access to education and healthi services, and even lower employment and income-&#13;
generating opportunities. Although the present civil code, approved by the Provisional&#13;
Government immediately after liberation, guarantees them basic rights, especially concerning&#13;
land ownership, marriage, and divorce, it will take time to bring about changes at the level of the&#13;
communities, most of which continue to follow patriarchal customary laws and traditions. The&#13;
Government has recently ratified a Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of&#13;
Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which aims to establish the framework to accelerate&#13;
progress in strengthening the legal and social status of women. A key element in the&#13;
Government development strategy is to improve the access of girls and wvomen to education and&#13;
MCfI services, and to support women's participation in credit and income-generating programs.&#13;
2.     Objectives of the Gender Action Plan. In line with the objectives of the Government's&#13;
policy and the Fund's mandate, the ECDF has developed a Gender Action Plan to ensure that&#13;
women benefit equally from ECDF-financed activities, and play an active role in identification,&#13;
design, and management of sub-projects. The plan not only gives special attention to&#13;
maximizing benefits to poor women, but also identifies any potential negative consequences for&#13;
women and proposes mitigatory measures.&#13;
3.     Key Elements of the Gender Action Plan. The key elements of the Gender Action&#13;
Plan, are summarized in the following tables:&#13;

Main Assumptions&#13;
Discount Rate                  12%&#13;
Real Exchange Rate            Constant 1995 prices&#13;
Time Horizon                  health, education, rural water supply, rural feeder roads (25 years)&#13;
Project Composition              Based on experience with the pilot, it is expected that the&#13;
composition of this demand-driven project will be as follows:&#13;
Health, Education, Rural Water, Feeder Roads, Natural Resources&#13;
Management and Pilot Savings and Credit&#13;
Nature of Benefits&#13;
Health Component              Reduction in (a) incidence of illness due to preventive care -&#13;
Expanded Program for Immunization, Maternal and Child Health,&#13;
Family Planning and (b) duration of illness due to curative care.&#13;
Benefits calculated from Health Survey 1994. Productivity gains&#13;
from fewer sick days valued at opportunity cost-shadow wage&#13;
Education Component           Incremental lifetime earnings net of opportunity cost of children's&#13;
time&#13;
Rural Water Supply Component  Reduction in water-borne infectious diseases. Benefits: (a) lower&#13;
medical care cost; (b) productivity gains from fewer sick days; (c)&#13;
productivity gains from release of women's time valued at&#13;
opportunity cost.&#13;
Rural Feeder Roads            Reduction in transportation costs&#13;
Risk:                           The project is not without some risk (mainly for institutional&#13;
reasons) but the potential benefits are so very high that the risks are&#13;
well worth taking. Also, with such high net benefits, the project&#13;
could perform significantly worse than expected and still be&#13;
economically justified&#13;
Main Beneficiaries&#13;
Health Component              800,000 people served by 100 primary health facilities&#13;
Education Component           55,000 children every year - more girls than boys&#13;
Rural Water Supply Component  11,250 people served by 236 water supply facilities, women&#13;
preferentially benefited.&#13;
Rural Feeder Roads            500,000 Farmers approximately&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Eritrea Community Development Fund
            Project (ECDF) will finance community-based sub-projects
            which in turn will: 1) support the rehabilitation and
            development of basic social and economic infrastructure
            critical to the improvement and development of the economic
            and social conditions of the population, especially in the
            remote and war devastated areas of Eritrea; and 2) improve
            the income-generating capacity of poor people and
            households. The sub-projects will include such social sector
            projects as the rehabilitation and construction of schools,
            health stations and clinics, water supply sources, and
            sanitation equipment. The sub-projects will be beneficial to
            the environmental conservation in areas affected by soil
            erosion and deforestation. The sub-projects will also
            provide communities with techniques for identifying
            development priorities, managing project implementation, and
            maintaining assets. The ECDF will not implement projects,
            but will support and facilitate the efforts of local
            communities and will ensure the provision of technical
            expertise in project implementation and management wherever
            the community needs. The implementation of the
            rehabilitation works will be carried out in a decentralized,
            pragmatic, and flexible way, and will give a large
            responsibility to the community for preparation and supervision.
