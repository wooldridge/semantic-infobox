               I. CONFLICT,RECENTPROGRESS,ANDTHECHALLENGEAHEAD&#13;
&#13;
1 ,     The Republic of the Congo (Congo) is gradually emerging from adecade ofpolitical&#13;
instability and conflict. In 1993-94, in 1997,and again in 1998-99, the country was torn by&#13;
violent conflicts, betweenforces loyal to various political leaders. War and civil disturbance,&#13;
compoundedby the sequels of a longperiod of mismanagement and corruption, have taken a&#13;
heavy toll on the country and its 3 million people. Physicaldamage is extensive, institutions are&#13;
inshambles, andpercapitaincomehasdeclinedfrom US$1,300 in1982to US$630in2000 (a&#13;
decline compounded by the devaluation of the CFA). Still, progress over the last three years&#13;
towards reconciliation and economic reforms have createdhopesthat the conflict trap -the cycle&#13;
of conflict and impoverishment -can be broken.&#13;
&#13;
A.      Impactof the Conflict&#13;
&#13;
2.      The conflicts have hada severe impact throughout Congo. The impact ofthe first two&#13;
conflicts (1993-94, and 1997)was concentratedinthe city of Brazzaville (which i s home to&#13;
about one quarter of the total population). The 1998-99 war brought havoc to southernCongo&#13;
(except the area around Pointe-Noire) andpartsof central Congo. Overall, damage and&#13;
disruptions are extensive, anda large partof the populationhas gone through horrendousordeals.&#13;
The country still has to deal with the legacy ofthese conflicts, including:&#13;
&#13;
    0   Social and humanitarian crisis. The 1998-99 war causedlarge population movements,&#13;
        affecting about 810,000 people (almost athird of the population). Displacedpersons&#13;
        sought refuge inthe forests, where they livedinappalling conditions for up to one year.&#13;
        UNICEF estimates that about 250,000 peoplewere still displaced in2002. Inparallel,&#13;
        humanrights abuses were widespread-causing great physical andpsychological&#13;
        hardship. These events have severely damagedthe social fabric ofthe Congolesesociety,&#13;
        andcreatedan environment where explosions of social violence are not uncommon.&#13;
&#13;
    0  Extensive looting. The conflicts were accompaniedby extensive looting of public as well&#13;
        as private assets. As a result, many institutions have been left inshambles (with damaged&#13;
        facilities, looted equipment, and lost records). Key private sector operatorshave closed&#13;
        down or reduced activities (non-oil activity, already weakened by the first conflicts,&#13;
        contractedby a further 19percent as aresult ofthe last war). A number of schools and&#13;
       healthcare facilities are no longer functional, leaving poor people with no access to basic&#13;
        services. Many families have losttheir few assets (50 percent of agricultural tools were&#13;
        destroyed and 75 percent of livestock was lost).&#13;
&#13;
    0  Infrastructure damage. Infrastructure suffered from bothfighting and sustainedlack of&#13;
        maintenance. The roadtransport network is no longer functioning, many localities can&#13;
       only be accessed by air andmost feeder roads are impassable. The railway line between&#13;
       Pointe Noire and Brazzaville, the economic umbilical cord of the country, was destroyed&#13;
        inseveralpoints. Thishasbrought economic exchangealmost to ahalt andis inhibiting&#13;
        agricultural growth- andhence itrepresents a major obstacleto economic recovery.&#13;
       Utilities, including telecommunications, water, and electricity services, were severely&#13;
       disrupted. Despite abundanthydroelectric resources, Congo is increasingly relyingon&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                 2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         electricity imports. Telecommunications services are not available outside the five main&#13;
         urban areas (Brazzaville, Pointe Noire, Dolisie, Ouesso, andNkayi), and where available&#13;
         are too expensive for most of the population.&#13;
&#13;
        Legacy of war-time mismanagement of economic resources. Public debt increased&#13;
         dramatically over the 1990s, which substantially reduces Government's capacity to&#13;
         address some of the problems it faces. At the end of 2001total medium-and long-term&#13;
        external debt, includingarrears amountedto 196percento f GDP. Domestic debt was&#13;
        about 30 percent of GDP in2000. Arrears are equivalent to about 94 percent of GDP. In&#13;
        parallel, many commercial banks becameinsolvent and illiquid-andhenceno longer&#13;
        havethe capacity to contribute to the revival of economic activity.&#13;
&#13;
    0   Increased incidence ofpoverty and unemployment. Dueto the combination of looting,&#13;
        lack of infrastructure, and a deterioratedpolicy environment, economic activity is very&#13;
        limited. This has translatedinto massiveunemployment (above 50 percent ofthe labor&#13;
        force) that leavesmany, especially the young, disenfranchised, socially excluded, and&#13;
        without prospects for a better future. The incidence of poverty has increased- with about&#13;
        70 percent ofthe population, mostly women, youth, and rural people, below the poverty&#13;
        line.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Spread of HIV/AIDS. War-time displacements and sexual violence have acceleratedthe&#13;
        spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemics. While detailed figures are not available, this has&#13;
        become one o fthe critical risks for Congo's medium-termdevelopmentprospects.&#13;
&#13;
B.      Progress Towards Peace and Reconciliation&#13;
&#13;
3.      Over the last three years, there has been continued progresstowards peace and&#13;
reconciliation. Since the cessationof hostilities inthe endof 1999, andthe signing of ceasefire&#13;
agreementsbetweenthe Government and key rebel leaders in2000, the security situation has&#13;
improved dramatically inBrazzaville and throughout the country. Progresshas been&#13;
consolidated inthe recent periodwith the demobilization anddisarmament o f some key militias&#13;
andthe signing on March 17,2003 of an agreement betweenthe Government and the last rebel&#13;
group, ledby "Pastor Ntumi", which had causedan upsurge of violence inMarch andJune, 2002&#13;
andagain from October 2002 to January 2003 inthe Pool Region. Still, the situation remains&#13;
fragile, andmost observers underlinethat significant efforts need to be made to address the&#13;
current social crisis for the progress o fthe last years to be sustainable.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Inparallel, progresshasbeenmadetowards national reconciliation, withinthe context of&#13;
the five-year politicaltransition period agreeduponwithinthe Forum National. Reconciliation&#13;
efforts culminated on April 14,2001 with the adoption of a new constitution (by 84 percent of&#13;
registeredvoters), and on March 10, 2002 with the peaceful holding ofpresidential elections.&#13;
Legislative, andsenatorial elections were heldover the summer of 2002, leading to the&#13;
installation of all institutions stipulated by the constitution inAugust 2002 -andthe Parliament&#13;
andthe Senate, bothdominated bythe coalitionassociatedwith President SassouNguesso,&#13;
startedtheir work. Local assemblies at the municipal and sub-regional levels were also elected&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                   3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(prefects and deputy prefects, incharge o fregional administration, are appointedby the&#13;
Government).&#13;
&#13;
C.      ProgressTowardsEconomicReform&#13;
&#13;
5.      The recovery process needs to be accompanied by a deep shift ineconomic policies.&#13;
Since independence in 1960, the successive Governments have not been able to translate the&#13;
country's rich economic potential into an actual improvement o f living conditions for the largest&#13;
part ofthe population. Despiteabundant oil resources, poor economic management under a&#13;
centrally-planned economy, compounded by severe transparency issues, have resulted ina&#13;
worsening of social and poverty indicators -which is seen as a substantial source o f instability in&#13;
the current fragile post-conflict context.&#13;
&#13;
6.      For the last year and a half, the Government has embarkedon a program o f economic&#13;
reforms, supported by the Bretton Woods Institutions, and inparticular by the Bank under an&#13;
Emergency Recovery Credit and by the IMF under the emergency post-conflict assistance&#13;
policy, and later a Staff Monitored Program. In-depth structural reforms have been launched in&#13;
the areas of economic governance, public expenditure management, poverty reduction,&#13;
transparency, financial sector, andpublic enterprises. Implementationis going well, andthere&#13;
are solid prospects for an access to the IMF Poverty Reductionand Growth Facility (PRGF) after&#13;
completion o fthe current Staff Monitored Program (which covers the period January to June&#13;
2003), possibly as early as Fall 2003.&#13;
&#13;
D.      The ChallengeAhead&#13;
&#13;
7.      Despiteprogress over the last years, Congo has yet to tackle the factors which&#13;
underpinned earlier rounds of conflict. For Congo, the key challenge over the coming years i s to&#13;
transform the relative political and economic stability achieved over the last couple o f years into&#13;
sustainable peace and economic recovery -that is, to break the cycle o f conflict and&#13;
impoverishment. Earlier lulls have been followed by renewed fighting within a few years. To&#13;
avoid a repetition o f such events, efforts have to focus on both addressing urgent needs and&#13;
tackling some o f the deep-rooted causes o f conflict (and inparticular the unequal distribution o f&#13;
oil revenues, the over-centralization o f a state-managed economy, and the disenfranchisement o f&#13;
large sectors o fthe population).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                  4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  11.     GOVERNMENT'S    RESPONSE&#13;
&#13;
A.      Economic Reform&#13;
&#13;
8.      The Government i s committed to pursuing the implementation of its economic reform&#13;
program, which is supported by the Bretton Woods Institutions, to maintain macro-economic&#13;
stability, while tackling some of the structural constraintsto economic growth andpoverty&#13;
reduction:&#13;
&#13;
   0    Economicprogram. The Government's 2003 program, underpinnedby the austerity&#13;
        budget, approved by Parliament inJanuary2003, aimsto: (i)       improve the health ofpublic&#13;
        finance; (ii)strengthentransparency inpetroleumsector transactions; (iii) upthe&#13;
                                                                                     free&#13;
        resources neededto reduce poverty; and (iv) normalize relations with creditors and&#13;
        reduce indebtednessto the banking system. The macroeconomic objectives are: (i)      real&#13;
        economic growth o f 2 percent despite amarked decline inoil production; (ii)    arate of&#13;
        inflationat 2 percent; and (iii)  aprimary budget surplus o f 9.3 percent of GDP.&#13;
&#13;
   e    Revenue. Inaddition, because of the downward trend inpetroleum output, whichwill&#13;
        only beturned around in2005, the mobilization of non-oiltax revenueassumes particular&#13;
        urgency. The Government is committed to apply rigorously the newmeasuresregarding&#13;
        forestry (increase of the forestry royalty from 4 to 8.5 percent) and custom reforms.&#13;
&#13;
   e    Expenditure. Regarding expenditure, the Government has taken steps to ensure strict&#13;
        adherenceto budgetary procedures. To contain current expenditure, a system of monthly&#13;
        expenditureceilings by ministrywas introduced inJanuary 2003. The Governmentwill&#13;
        also conduct targeted value-for-money audits to ensure the efficacy and legality of public&#13;
        expenditure. The Government has also endeavoredto re-orient budgetary expenditureto&#13;
        priority social sectors.&#13;
&#13;
        Oil sector. Inthe oil sector, to strengthentransparency, the Government has launcheda&#13;
        series of audits o f the national oil company (SNPC). Oil revenues are being transferred&#13;
        infullto the Treasury, to finance budgetarypriorities. The Government intendsto&#13;
        continue inthis direction, andto broadenthe anti-corruption effort to other sectors.&#13;
&#13;
   0    Debt. The Government intendsto pursueandintensify its policy of normalizing relations&#13;
        with all creditors. Paymentshave beenmadebothfor current service andto reduce&#13;
        arrears -which has allowed, inparticular, for the resumption o fthe African Development&#13;
        Bank's institutional support.&#13;
&#13;
9.      Implementation to date has been encouraging, although there remain solidly-entrenched&#13;
vestedinterests. Despite the resistance it faces insome quarters, the Government has keptthe&#13;
overall effort on track and made noticeable progress insome key areas.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                 5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B.      T h e Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper&#13;
&#13;
10.     The Government's responseis framedwithinthe context ofthe preparationofa Poverty&#13;
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The PRSP is currently under preparation (an InterimPRSP is&#13;
being finalized and is expectedto be publishedby late Summer 2003), but a consensushas&#13;
already emergedaround its overarching goal -to consolidate peaceand economic reform. The&#13;
paper is expected to be articulated around five major strategic building blocks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0    Strengthening the macro-economic framework topromote growth -including: (i)&#13;
        attracting private investmentfor rehabilitating socio-economic infrastructures; (ii)&#13;
        restructuring andprivatizing key public enterprises; (iii)reformingthe financial sector;&#13;
        (iv) improvingthe business environment inorder to facilitate a diversification ofthe&#13;
        economy; and (v) tackling the debt issue;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0    Ensuringgrowth ispro-poor -and inparticular supporting the integration and&#13;
        participation of poor and socially excluded people. This will require action in:(i)&#13;
                                                                                          human&#13;
        development; (ii) development; and (iii)&#13;
                           rural                       specific programs for minorities and&#13;
        disadvantagedcitizens;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0    Promoting good governance, strengthening capacity, and civilpeace -through: (i)&#13;
        institutionalreforms; (ii)strengthening of democratic institutions and processes; (iii)&#13;
                                  a&#13;
        fight against corruption; and (iv)judiciary reforms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0    Improvingaccess to basic socio-economic in3astructure and services andpreserving the&#13;
        environment -includingactivities inthe education, health, water, and electricity sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0    Fighting the HIVAIDS epidemic -through bothprevention andtreatment.&#13;
&#13;
C.      Decentralization&#13;
&#13;
11.     To implementthis ambitious agenda, while remedyingto the over-centralization ofthe&#13;
past, the Government has also embarkedon an in-depthdecentralization program. Accordingto&#13;
recently-passedlaws, there will be severallevels of Government:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0    The Central Government, which includes inparticular all sectoral administrations and to&#13;
        whom branchoffices will continue to report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0    Ten "dkpartements" (formerly "regions"), covering the entire territory, with a population&#13;
        typically ranging from 80,000 to 200,000 people each. DCpartementalinstitutions&#13;
        include anelected council, an executive office of the council, andan elected presidentof&#13;
        the councilwho has the executive authority over technical services. The dkpartementis&#13;
        sub-dividedinto districts, rural communities, and villages and also includes&#13;
        municipalities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0    Six "municipalities corresponding to urban areas of more than20,000 people. These&#13;
                            'I,&#13;
        include Brazzaville (about 800,000 inhabitants), Pointe Noire (about 600,000&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                   6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        inhabitants), and four "smaller municipalities" with population rangingfrom 20,000 to&#13;
        70,000 people. Other urbancenters inCongo are only small towns with population&#13;
        below 10,000 people. Municipal institutions include an elected council, an executive&#13;
        office o fthe council, and an elected mayor, who has the executive authority over&#13;
        technical services. The municipalities are divided into "arrondissements".&#13;
&#13;
12.     Departements andmunicipalities together are called "local collectivities". While decrees&#13;
defining the responsibilities to be handled at local level are still to be issued insome sectors,&#13;
local collectivities are expected to have expanded responsibilities inthe following areas:&#13;
planning, urbanism, education, health, social action, environment, agriculture, public works,&#13;
transport, mining, energy, employment, and general administration. Although financial&#13;
constraints and the continued control by the Governmentalauthorities over local branches o f&#13;
sectoral administration may prevent local collectivities from playing an active role inthe day-to-&#13;
day delivery o f social services, elected assemblies at the dipartemental and municipal level are&#13;
the most legitimate bodies for the definition o f investmentpriorities inthe relevant geographical&#13;
areas.&#13;
&#13;
13.     It is expected that the decentralizationeffort, ifproperly implemented, will help empower&#13;
local communities and improve local governance - and hence contribute to the gradual&#13;
stabilization o fthe political and social situation by tackling one o fthe key issues underlyingthe&#13;
repeated bursts o fviolence o f the 1990s. This is particularly important for about half o f Congo's&#13;
3 millionpeople who live outside the two main cities (Brazzaville andPointe Noire).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                  7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                            111.   INTERNATIONAL     AND IDA RESPONSE&#13;
&#13;
A.      InternationalResponse&#13;
&#13;
14.     Over the last years, the international community has gradually re-engagedinCongo, and&#13;
has shiftedits focus from humanitarian aid to development-oriented programs. Key donors&#13;
include: the EuropeanUnion (EU), France, and the UnitedStates -who are involvedina variety&#13;
ofinfrastructure rehabilitation, community development, and capacity enhancement programs.&#13;
Inparallel, UNagencies, inparticular the UnitedNatiops DevelopmentProgram(UNDP),&#13;
launchedspecific programs to support local communities and strengtheninstitutions. Still, the&#13;
country has not yet received a level of support commensurateto its needs or comparable to other&#13;
post-conflict countries -and assistance has remainedfocused on the most accessibleareas -&#13;
particularly the cities o f Brazzaville and PointeNoire.&#13;
&#13;
15.    With recent developments, however, this support i s expectedto gradually increase, as&#13;
Congo is meeting some o fthe pre-requirementsset by some donors -inareas such as&#13;
democratization, decentralization, and economic reforms. Inthis context, a Donor Information&#13;
meeting is expectedto be heldinJuly 2003 to review the Government's progress over the last&#13;
period and to discuss ways by whichthe international community could support the stabilization&#13;
andrecovery processina more robust manner. This could pavethe way for abroader&#13;
involvement of donors.&#13;
&#13;
B.     IDA Response&#13;
&#13;
16.    The Bankre-engagedinCongo in2001 within the context of aTransitional Support&#13;
Strategy (TSS), which was discussedby the Board on January 16,2001. A newTSS is under&#13;
preparationandshould be submittedto the Board inFall 2003. Underthe current TSS, the Bank&#13;
launcheda number o f activities, including:&#13;
&#13;
    0  Lending operations. Since early 2001, the Bankhas approved: (i)     aUS$38 millionPost-&#13;
       Conflict Economic Rehabilitation Credit (inJuly 2001) to help Congo inthe aftermath of&#13;
       its clearanceo f its large arrears to the World Bank and support implementation of key&#13;
       structural reforms, helpto better manage fiscal resources, and assist inimproving&#13;
       governance andtransparency inthe oil sector; (ii)   a US$5 million Emergency&#13;
       Demobilizationand Reintegration Project (inJuly 2001) to facilitate the reintegration of&#13;
       about 10,000 ex-combatants into civil life; (iii)aUS$7 millionTransparency and&#13;
       Governance Capacity BuildingProject (inFebruary 2002) to accompany reforms&#13;
       supportedunder the Post Conflict Economic Recovery Credit; and (iv) a US$40 million&#13;
       Infrastructure Rehabilitation andImprovement of LivingConditions Project (inApril&#13;
       2002) to rehabilitate key infrastructure (including portions o fthe key railroad link,roads,&#13;
       andhealth facilities) andhelpmitigate unemployment issuesthrough avariety of labor-&#13;
       intensive micro-projects. An HIV/AIDSProject is also under preparationto help contain&#13;
       the rapidly spreading epidemics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0  Non-lending activities. Inparallel, the Bank has initiateda Public Expenditure Review&#13;
       (PER), a study on natural resourcesmanagement, and a labor-market analysis. These&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                    8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        efforts are expected to help tackle some o fthe key transparency and effectiveness issues&#13;
        the country i s facing with regardto economic management.&#13;
&#13;
C.      Rationale for the Project&#13;
&#13;
17.     For the full benefits o fthe recovery effort supported by earlier IDA-funded projects to&#13;
materialize, however, the benefits o freform and recovery needto be distributed to all&#13;
communities throughout the country. Mucho fthe assistanceto date has been limitedto the most&#13;
accessible areas, namely the cities o f Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. There is a widespread&#13;
consensusthat support to other parts o fthe country is critical to prevent the returno f civil unrest&#13;
and violence, as well as the further deterioration o f living conditions throughout Congo.&#13;
&#13;
18.     The Project is hence a response to calls by the Government and Congolese stakeholders&#13;
for the Bank to provide support to the recovery o f communities throughout the country. The&#13;
Project is fully consistent with the objectives o f the TSS and i s expected to complement efforts&#13;
already underway to help the Government tackle some of the root causes o f the conflict -by&#13;
supporting further economic reforms and focusing on areas outside Brazzaville and PointeNoire.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                         9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                             IV.      OVERALLPROJECT       DESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
A.         Objectives&#13;
&#13;
19.     The objective o f the Project is to assist the recovery o f communities living insmaller&#13;
municipalities and rural areas (Le. with a focus on areas outside the two cities o f Brazzaville and&#13;
Pointe Noire). This i s critical for sustaining the momentum o f reconciliation and economic&#13;
reform, and for consolidating the achievements o fthe last two years - so as to prevent new&#13;
eruptions o f violence.&#13;
&#13;
20.     To that effect, and inline with the objectives outlined inthe TSS, the Project aims to&#13;
support interventions infour parallel directions: (i) financial support for the&#13;
                                                        provide&#13;
implementation o fpriority, small-scale rehabilitationand economic revitalization activities inall&#13;
departements; (ii) support activities initiated by local NGOs and community-based organizations&#13;
inall dkpartements; (iii) instrengthening administrativecapacities, at boththe central and&#13;
                          assist&#13;
local levels o f Government to facilitate implementation o fthe economic reform and&#13;
decentralization programs; and (iv) provide balance o fpayments support to finance critical&#13;
imports for the delivery o f basic social services by local governments.&#13;
&#13;
21.     Detailed performance indicators for the project are provided inAppendix F.&#13;
&#13;
B.      EmergencyNatureof the Project&#13;
&#13;
22.     Inview ofthe fragility ofthe social situationbrought about andexacerbated bythe&#13;
conflict, and o fthe urgency to provide support to consolidate peace andmaintain the pace o f&#13;
reforms, the Project will be processed under OP8.50 on emergency recovery assistance. The&#13;
criteria for usingOP 8.50 procedures are being met, as follows:&#13;
&#13;
    Impact on economicpriorities and investmentprograms. The impact o f the conflict on the&#13;
    economy and living conditions has been devastating. The Project i s expected to: (i)       support&#13;
    the strengthening o f local government, which is key for the effective provision o f basic social&#13;
    services inthe local collectivities; (ii)help maintainthe pace o f economic reforms; and (iii)&#13;
    contribute to improving living conditions inareas which have received limited external&#13;
    support and where poverty i s acute.&#13;
&#13;
    Frequency. The emergency is the result o fa cycle o fwars -not o frecurring natural events.&#13;
&#13;
    Urgency. The conflicts have causedtremendous suffering, widespread economic disruption,&#13;
    andweakened institutional andhumancapacities. Most observers fear that unless "dividends&#13;
    o fpeace" are rapidly provided inthe interior o fthe country, poverty and social crisis could&#13;
    generate renewed violence and insecurity, as exemplified by last year's events inthe Pool&#13;
    region.&#13;
&#13;
    Prospectsfor reducingfuture hazards. The Project is part o f a series o f operations which are&#13;
    aimed at tackling some o f the root causes o fthe cycle o fwar -to helpprevent the recurrence&#13;
    of conflict. For this effort to be successfbl, however, the Project is critical as it i s one o f the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                    10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   only channels to assist available communities insmall towns and rural areas intheir recovery&#13;
   efforts.&#13;
&#13;
a  Expected economic benejts. The Project i s expected to help rehabilitate vital local&#13;
   infrastructure, provide short-term employment, and improve economic governance - all&#13;
   activities which would yield important economic and social benefits, andwould contribute to&#13;
   stabilizing a volatile social situation.&#13;
&#13;
C.       Overall Design&#13;
&#13;
23.    Components. The Project will include four complementary components:&#13;
&#13;
   Two components are directly aimed at implementing rehabilitation and economic&#13;
   revitalization activities inthe ten dkpartements, through processes which are expected to help&#13;
   strengthen social capital and create short- and medium-term employment opportunities.&#13;
   Component A will provide resources for the development o f consultative processes to select&#13;
   investment priorities at the level o f each dkpartement, and for the actual implementationo f&#13;
   these priority activities. Component B will provide support to local NGOs and community-&#13;
   based organizations inimplementing community-level activities, and instrengthening their&#13;
   capacities.&#13;
&#13;
   Two components are aimed at supporting the economic reform and decentralization&#13;
   processes, with a view to maintaining the pace o f reforms and improving economic&#13;
   management inthe dkpartements and municipalities. Component C will provide resources&#13;
   for capacity enhanckment activities at boththe central and local levels o f government.&#13;
   Component D will provide balance o fpayments support, to help the Government finance&#13;
   critical imports to facilitate the effective provision o f services by local levels o f government.&#13;

other activities under a broadstrategy of support to Congo infacing the challenges associated&#13;
withpost-conflict recovery.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Other IDA Activities: The Project will consolidate the benefits from ongoing projects,&#13;
        and expandtheir scope to areas outside Brazzaville andPointeNoire -placesthat have&#13;
        upto now, received little support. Itwill complement activities under the Infrastructure&#13;
        Rehabilitation and Improvement o f Living Conditions Project (mainly focused on&#13;
        Brazzaville and PointeNoire) and underthe Transparency and GovernanceCapacity&#13;
        Building Project (by providingfurther capacity enhancement insupport of reforms).&#13;
&#13;
    0   Other Donors: The Project will also buildon and complement actions by key donors&#13;
        includingthe European Commission (EC), France, UNagencies, particularly the United&#13;
        Nations Development Program (UNDP), andthe UnitedStates -who are involvedina&#13;
        variety of infrastructure rehabilitation, community development, and capacity&#13;
        enhancement programs.&#13;
&#13;
25.     Sustainability. Sustainability of individualrehabilitation andeconomic revitalization&#13;
activities financed under components A and B will be ensuredthrough aprocessof priority&#13;
selection which will exclude all proposalsfor which there is insufficient commitment to, or&#13;
provisions for, operation andmaintenance. Sustainability ofthe capacity enhancement activities&#13;
financed under component C and ofthe decision-making processes to be developedunder&#13;
component A will be ensuredthrough: (i)      continued involvement and support over arelatively&#13;
long implementation periodto provide sufficient time for key reforms to "take root"; (ii)&#13;
involvement of stakeholders for the monitoringof reforms implementation (e.g., regular&#13;
publication o f audits); and (iii)&#13;
                                policy dialogue betweenthe Bank, and where relevant the IMF,&#13;
andthe Government to guide the selection of specific activities to be financed.&#13;

&#13;
E.     Lessons Learned Reflected in Project Design&#13;
&#13;
28.    A numberof lessons havebeen learned through Bank interventions inother post-conflict&#13;
countries, as well as through earlier interventions inCongo. These lessons have been reflected in&#13;
the overall designo fthe operation, as well as inthe technical design o feach component.&#13;
&#13;
29.    The most important lessons for the overall design o f the project include:&#13;
&#13;
       Importance ofpeace and reform dividends. Experience inpost-conflict countries shows&#13;
       that the rapid and effective provision o f support ina fragile political and social context i s&#13;
       critical to restore hope incommunities, and hence allow for consolidating peace and&#13;
       implementing economic reforms. Such support can consist insmall investments or in&#13;
       supporting local economic activities, but it should be widely distributedthroughout the&#13;
       country to have its maximal impact.&#13;
&#13;
       Importance of a successful decentralization process. Incomplex post-conflict&#13;
       environments, decentralization is often critical to stability. Still, the process needs to be&#13;
       managed to prevent the fragmentation o fthe country, and the deterioration o f social&#13;
       services delivery. Critical elements o f success include: (i) the capacity o f local levels o f&#13;
       government; (ii)  the existence o fparticipatory mechanisms involving all relevant&#13;
       stakeholders, inparticular to strengthen accountability o fpublic authorities; and (iii)  the&#13;
       adequacy o f fiscal resources available to local levels o f government, whether local taxes&#13;
       or fiscal transfers.&#13;
&#13;
       Importance offlexibility and demand-driven mechanisms to effectively respondto&#13;
       rapidly-changing needs. Inrapidly-changing situations where the difficulties to come&#13;
       cannot be fully foreseen, experience shows the importance o f designing implementation&#13;
       mechanisms which allow for a flexible and rapid response to emerging needs -so as to&#13;
       allow for the removal o f critical bottlenecks as they appear. Still, flexibility should go&#13;
       hand-in-hand with focus, to ensure a maximal impact o f the assistance -andhence the&#13;
       importance o f a specific definition o f priority areas. Projects with mechanisms for&#13;
       flexibility, andprojects relying on demand-drivenmechanisms are best suited to provide&#13;
       the type o fresponses needed insuch environments.&#13;
&#13;
       Relevance of community-level interventions. A growing body o f evidence from Bank-&#13;
       financed projects demonstrates that community-level projects are particularly appropriate&#13;
       for post-conflict environments. Inthe Rwanda Community Reintegration and&#13;
       Development Project, for example, close attention to usingjoint community activities to&#13;
       promote reconciliation between ethnic groups has been so successful that the Rwandan&#13;
       Government has extended the post-conflict designinto its national development plan.&#13;
       Another benefit o f this approach inpost-conflict environments is its speed. The East&#13;
       Timor Community Empowerment Project was able to attain national coverage within one&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                             13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     year of appraisal (albeit inavery small country), and it has beenretained by the post-&#13;
     transition government. These projects have demonstrated conflict managementoutcomes&#13;
     thereby reducing tensions betweenresidents. Subprojects selectedthrough a local&#13;
     planning processare also usually better maintained thanprojects built on the basis of an&#13;
     external master plan, particularly incountrieswith tight budgetary constraints for local&#13;
     maintenance work.&#13;
&#13;
     Importance offinancial support at critical times to keep reforms on track. Experience&#13;
     shows that, where there i s the capacity to manage funds with adequatetransparency, the&#13;
     provisionof early balanceofpaymentssupport is critical to keep economic reforms on&#13;
     track -particularly inthe context of heavily-indebted countries.&#13;
&#13;
     Importance of targeted institutional support. There is ample evidence to suggest that the&#13;
     strengtheningof key institutions is a critical ingredient for the success of complex&#13;
     economic programs inthe aftermath of a conflict. InDRC, programs similar to those&#13;
    proposedunder component C, have provenkey to helping designandimplement some of&#13;
     the most important economic reforms ofthe last years -thereby allowing for satisfactory&#13;
     performance under the program supportedby the Bretton Woods Institutions.&#13;
&#13;
30.  The most important lessonsfor the designof implementation arrangements include:&#13;
&#13;
     Thefeasibility of overcoming the dfficult capacity constraints in the Congolesecontext,&#13;
     as demonstratedthrough the early success inimplementing the Emergency&#13;
     Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and Living Conditions Improvement Project. Proposed&#13;
     implementation arrangementswill buildon this experience.&#13;
&#13;
    Importance of simplicity in the design of implementation mechanisms. Implementation&#13;
     arrangements should be kept simpleto accommodatelimitedcapacity. Where&#13;
     institutional capacity i s lacking, non-governmental partnersand international agencies&#13;
     can provide useful and effective assistance inimplementing parts of emergency projects.&#13;
&#13;
   e Theneed topay particular attention to issues of transparency. This is critical not only to&#13;
     ensure proper use o f emergency resources, but also to facilitate the mobilizationof&#13;
    further donor support. Allprojects currently funded by the Bank inCongo have&#13;
     successfully dealt with transparency issues.&#13;
&#13;
     The importance of close supervision and hands-on support by the Bank during&#13;
    implementation. Particular attention needs to bepaidto the quality and sustainability of&#13;
    selectedactivities, as well as to the level of inclusion o f women andmarginalized groups.&#13;
&#13;
31. Lessons gained from consultations withNGOs active inCongo include:&#13;
&#13;
    A consensus that creating economic opportunities in rural areas would go a long way&#13;
    towards stabilizing the social situation and improving the security situation inbothrural&#13;
    areas andurbancenters (which would benefit from increasedsecurity and better supplies&#13;
    of agricultural products). Small-scale rehabilitation projects carried out through labor-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                          14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  intensive mechanisms as well as employment generation activities can play a critical role&#13;
  inproviding poor andvolatile populationswitheconomic opportunities. This couldalso&#13;
  provide an important outlet for demobilized soldiers inneed o freintegration, without&#13;
  providing perverse incentives by singling them out.&#13;
&#13;
eA consensus that Congolesestakeholders can effectively participate inplanning activities&#13;
  as well as in monitoringeffective implementation. There is concernthough, that local&#13;
 NGOs often have limitedcapacity and needto be strengthened before or as they are&#13;
  beinggiven responsibility for implementation of significant activities.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                    15&#13;
&#13;
                           v.     DETAILED    DESCRIPTIONOFCOMPONENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ComponentA : Financingof PriorityLocalInvestments(US$14 million)&#13;
&#13;
Objective&#13;
&#13;
32.      This component aims to help relieve the economic and social hardship caused by the&#13;
successive crises inareas that have received little external support over the last years, while&#13;
strengthening participatory mechanisms for decision-making at local level. It will help address&#13;
some o f the rehabilitation challenges inthe dkpartements andtackle unemployment issues by&#13;
promoting the use o f labor-intensive methods. Wherever possible and/or appropriate, special&#13;
attentionwill be given to providing employment to disenfranchised groups including former&#13;
combatants, unemployed youth, and female heads o f households. Activities under this&#13;
component will also facilitate the establishment o f an adequate consultative mechanism for&#13;
selecting local investment priorities at the dkpartement level. This is expected to help improve&#13;
local governance over time and could eventually form the basis for preparation and monitoring&#13;
o f poverty reductionprograms at the local level withinthe context o f the PRSP process.&#13;
&#13;
Allocations&#13;
&#13;
33.      Upon effectiveness, each dkpartement will be communicated a maximum allocation for&#13;
activities on its territory. This initial allocation will be based on a formula set by the Ministry of&#13;
Finance (75 percent of the amount distributedthrough equal allocations and 25 percent in&#13;
proportion to the population), for a total o f US$8 million. After eighteen months o f&#13;
implementation, a second allocation will be provided, for a total corresponding to the amount&#13;
remaining available under the component. The second allocation will be based on an adjusted&#13;
formula, which will reflect implementationperformance for the first allocation.&#13;
&#13;
Selection and Financing of Activities&#13;
&#13;
34.      Allocations will be communicated to the dkpartements by the entity tasked by the&#13;
Government to execute component A (executing entity A). Onthe basis o f the allocations, the&#13;
executing entity A will facilitate a consultative decision-making process to set priorities ineach&#13;
beneficiary entity. It i s expected that a strong promotional campaignwill be undertakenby the&#13;
implementingagency duringthe initialperiod after effectiveness. The campaignwill&#13;
particularly draw on networks that are represented throughout the country and that have access to&#13;
poor districts and households (e.g., churches). The executing entity A will encourage and&#13;
facilitate the necessary consultationbetweenkey stakeholders and relevant technical entities, for&#13;
a set o f local priorities to be agreed upon betweenthese representatives. Inorder to help&#13;
empower elected local assemblies, this process and its outcome will have to be validated by the&#13;
dkpartemental assemblies. Once the priorities are approved, andprovided the activities are&#13;
eligible for financing under the Project, the executing entity A will be responsible for procuring&#13;
the necessary works, goods, and services, and for supervisingproper execution o f the activities.&#13;
While looking for a broadparticipation o fall stakeholders, the implementing agency will be&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                   16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
responsible for ensuring that the consultationprocess does not extend beyond two months after&#13;
launch inaverage.&#13;
&#13;
35.      The executing entity A will also be responsible for advertisingthe decisions made and&#13;
mobilizing communities insupport o f monitoring and evaluation. Allocations and lists o f&#13;
priority investments will be published innational media, including radio, as well as locally.&#13;
Specifics on each activity (amount, implementation schedule, respective responsibilities) will be&#13;
posted by the executing entity A inkey locations for the beneficiary communities (e.g. schools,&#13;
etc.).&#13;
&#13;
36.     Eligibility criteria for activities financedunder the component will be as follows:&#13;
&#13;
    Nature of the activities. Selected activities should yield benefits widely distributed within the&#13;
    relevant dtpartement and contribute to improving living conditions withinthe community.&#13;
    Activities that can be financed may include, but will not be limitedto: social infrastructure&#13;
    (e.g., primary schools, dispensaries, community centers), economic infrastructure (e.g.,&#13;
    water, markets, slaughterhouses, transport, and energy), environmental and sanitation (e.g.,&#13;
    rehabilitationo f sewage and drainage networks, public squares) and other labor-intensive&#13;
    rehabilitation projects with a positive impact on the community. Works, furniture,&#13;
    equipment, materials andthe delivery o f services (such as training o f teachers or nurses, and&#13;
    campaigns to prevent the spread o f infectious diseases) can be financed- with no mandatory&#13;
    thresholds for community participation.&#13;
&#13;
    Commitment to operation and maintenance. Realistic and sustainable mechanisms for&#13;
    operation and maintenance (including financing) o fthe rehabilitated infrastructure and&#13;
    facilities should be devised prior to the selection of the activity. This should include clear&#13;
    financing plans, as well as the namingo f individuals incharge. Particular attention will be&#13;
    paidto long-term sustainability, so that actions taken duringthe emergency situation (e.g. job&#13;
    creation) do not have long-term adverse consequences on institutions and programs (e.g. poor&#13;
    quality o frehabilitated facilities).&#13;
&#13;
    Local contribution. An upfront contribution inthe form o f a provision corresponding to&#13;
    resources necessary for one year o f operation and maintenance will be required from the&#13;
    beneficiary local collectivity. This contribution could include in-cashand in-kindelements.&#13;
&#13;
    Expected labor content. For activities to be approved, wage costs should represent a large&#13;
    part o fthe total cost o f the project. Initial negotiation with the communities will be grounded&#13;
    ontargets to be set by the Government andthe executing agency based on experience to date&#13;
    inCongo. These targets will be revisedbasedonthe experience gainedalong duringthe&#13;
    implementation phase. The selection process will favor activities with the highest job created&#13;
    by US$invested ratio. Particular attention will be given to the share o f employment&#13;
    opportunities accessible to women and former combatants.&#13;
&#13;
    Maximal size and duration. Individual activities should not exceed US$200,000, andit&#13;
    should be possible to complete them within 12months after inception, keeping inmind&#13;
    seasonal constraints.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                   17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ImpLementation&#13;
&#13;
37.     The executing entity A will be employed by the Government through aservice contract.&#13;
Itwill have fullresponsibility for carrying out the activities financed underthe component, on&#13;
behalf of the Government, and inparticular for procurement and financial management-within&#13;
the context o f an operational manual approved by IDA as a condition o f effectiveness. It will&#13;
directly enter into contracts with local enterprises to carry out the relevant activities, and will&#13;
supervisethe execution o fthis contract, with a close involvement o fbeneficiaries inthe&#13;
monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
38.     Part o f the resourcesunderthe componentwill be usedfor financing the executing entity&#13;
A's operating costs directly related to the implementation ofthe component, as per a budget and&#13;
staffing planagreeableto IDA.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ComponentB: Support to CommunityOrganizations(USS3 million)&#13;
&#13;
Objective&#13;
&#13;
40.     This component aims to support small-scalelocal initiatives andto strengthensocial&#13;
capital inall dkpartements as a key element of a successful decentralization and empowerment&#13;
process. By strengthening community-based organizations, the Project aims to create the type o f&#13;
social organizationthat i s necessary for stakeholdersto participate effectively inthe definitionof&#13;
key priorities for poverty reduction, as well as for eventually increasing accountability oflocal&#13;
authorities vis-&amp;vis the population. To that effect, the component will finance bothactivities&#13;
initiated by localNGOs and associations (whichare expectedto focus on economic&#13;
development) andprograms to enhance technical and managerial capacity of these organizations.&#13;
&#13;
41.     The component i s critical inan environment where social capital has been severely&#13;
erodedby a decade of conflict andpolitical instability duringwhich large groups ofpeople were&#13;
forced to flee their homes and communities, andwere subjectedto large-scalehuman rights&#13;
violations. Restoring some organizational structure inthe non-government sector i s essentialfor&#13;
the eventualsuccess ofthe decentralization effort as well as for the stabilization ofrural areas&#13;
and small towns. Inthis context, the component builds on lessons learned inimplementing&#13;
demand-drivencommunity development projects inAfrica and elsewhere -inparticular as&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                18&#13;

regards: (i) importance o f empowering communities, inview of the role that such empowered&#13;
             the&#13;
communities can play inimproving design, implementation, andmonitoringof poverty reduction&#13;
strategies; and (ii)the needto accompany the provision of financing for activities with capacity&#13;

&#13;
Financing of Activities&#13;
&#13;
42.      The componentwill finance demand-driven activities initiated by localNGOs and&#13;
associationswhich meet a numberof pre-set criteria.&#13;
&#13;
    Nature of the NGO andor association. Eligibility criteria for the beneficiary organization&#13;
    will include: (i)being registered under Congoleselaw; (ii) inexistencefor more than&#13;
                                                                 being&#13;
    six months, andhave acquired experiencewhich i s relevant for the activities to be financed&#13;
    under the Project; (iii)beingbasedor having hadprior activity inthe relevant dipartement;&#13;
    and (iv) having adequateprocesses andproceduresinplace for accounts to be certified and&#13;
    auditedwith regardto activities financed under the component, including owning abank&#13;
    account ina financial institutionacceptableto the Bank. Where capacity is insufficient to&#13;
    meeteligibility criteria, localNGOs or associationsmay be askedto collaborate with other&#13;
    reputablenational or international NGOs, dependingon their records.&#13;
&#13;
    Nature of the activity to bejnanced. The activity should help address a priority needfelt by&#13;
    the community/group andmightinclude: small-scaleinfrastructure repairs; development of&#13;
    community assets; small socio-economic infrastructure for community use suchas markets&#13;
    and storage facilities; provision of agricultural inputs andtools; establishmento frevolving&#13;
    funds; provisionof social service; purchaseoftraining or technical services; purchaseof food&#13;
    processingand other appropriate technologies; and community centers and cultural activities.&#13;
    Additional criteria will include: (i) of the requiredfunding, should not exceed&#13;
                                         size&#13;
    US$20,000 per activity; (ii)  complexity of the activity, should be commensuratewith the&#13;
    initiatingorganization's capacity and experience; (iii)  commitment to operation and&#13;
    maintenance as appropriate, demonstratedthrough the existence of a realistic andfunded&#13;
    operation andmaintenanceplan; and (iv) compliance with legal and regulatory requirements&#13;
    for the activity considered.&#13;
&#13;
43.      Inaddition, efforts will bemadeto ensure awide distribution ofactivities across allten&#13;
dipartements andrelevant technical areas. Specific mechanisms will be definedinthe&#13;
Operational Manual to ensure such distribution.&#13;
&#13;
44.     LocalNGOs and associationswill submit proposals-including evidence of eligibility&#13;
and adetailed description o fthe proposed activity -to the entity taskedby the Government to&#13;
execute component B (executing entity B). The activity will be financed underthe component, if&#13;
the initiatingagency andthe proposedactivity bothmeet eligibility criteria. Recipient&#13;
organization will be requiredto make an upfront contribution (which could include in-kind&#13;
contributions) inthe form o f aprovision for the first year of operation andmaintenance.&#13;
Beneficiary NGOs and associationswill be encouragedto obtain complementary support from&#13;
other entities such as private providers, NGOs, UNAgencies, and government technical&#13;
agencies.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                      19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
45.     With the support o fthe executing entity B-and withinthe context o f an operational&#13;
manualto be prepared by the executing entity B and approved by IDA as a condition o f&#13;
effectiveness -, the beneficiary NGOs and associations will be responsible for the&#13;
implementation o fthe activities they have selected. Financial support will be disbursed in&#13;
several tranches, following a schedule agreed uponbetweeneach beneficiary organizationand&#13;
the executing entity B. The first tranche, will bepaidat inception, andsubsequent tranches will&#13;
be paid after the executing entity B has verified the effective use o f earlier tranches (e.g., the&#13;
actual completion o f a pre-agreed part o fthe works, the effective purchase o f pre-agreed inputs&#13;
or equipment, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
CapacityEnhancement Support&#13;
&#13;
46.     This component will assist beneficiary organizations insub-project implementation and&#13;
management by providing financial and supervisory support andby enhancing managerial and&#13;
technical capacities. This will be a critical factor for the sustainability o f activities financed by&#13;
the project, as well as for the medium-term strengthening o f social capital inthe country.&#13;
&#13;
47.     Inconsultationwith the potentialbeneficiaries, the implementingagency will select&#13;
appropriate intermediariesto provide the requisite technical assistance to local groups inthe&#13;
coordination, design, implementation, monitoring, supervision and operation o ftheir selected&#13;
activity, The executing entity B will procure the corresponding services. A symbolic fee will be&#13;
requiredfrom those entities benefiting from these programs.&#13;
&#13;
PromotionalActivities&#13;
&#13;
48.     A strong promotional campaignwill be undertaken bythe executing entity Bduringthe&#13;
initial period after effectiveness. The campaign will particularly draw on networks that are&#13;
represented throughout the country and have access to poor districts and households (e.g.,&#13;
churches).&#13;
&#13;
Implementation&#13;
&#13;
49.     The component will be implementedthrough a service contract betweenthe Government&#13;
andthe executing entity B. The executing entity Bwill enter into contractual arrangements with&#13;
the beneficiary organizations (which will procure the necessary works, goods, and services).&#13;
Part o fthe resources under the component will be used for financing the executing entity B's&#13;
operating costs directly relatedto the implementationo fthe component, as per a budgetand&#13;
staffing planagreeable to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
CostBreakdown&#13;

Component C: Capacitv Enhancement Support (US$8 million)&#13;
&#13;
Objective&#13;
&#13;
51.     This component aims to complement existing programs with a view to assistingthe&#13;
Government address some o fthe key issues associatedwith the process of decentralization and&#13;
economic reform. The project will particularly aim to:&#13;
&#13;
        Improve economic management in the newly-created dkpartements and municipalities&#13;
        which have been entrustedwith significant responsibilities inthe social and infrastructure&#13;
        sectors. These entities currently have very limitedeconomic management capacity -&#13;
        whether for the selection of investment priorities or for the preparationandexecution of a&#13;
        proper budget. Their administrative capacity has severely suffered from the conflicts&#13;
        through the loss of staff, infrastructure, equipment andrecords. Inaddition, they are&#13;
        chronically under-fundedpartly due to inefficiencies inthe revenue collection systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   8    Provide the central Government with both technical assistance and institutional support&#13;
        inorder to strengthencapacity inkeypublic institutions andto implementsome ofthe&#13;
        economic reforms which are critical to restoring sustainedand sustainable economic&#13;
        growth throughout the country.&#13;
&#13;
52.     These efforts will build on activities that have beensupportedby the Bank over the last&#13;
two years, withinthe context of the economic dialogue supportedwith the Post-Conflict&#13;
Economic Recovery Credit andthe Transparency and Governance Capacity Enhancement&#13;
Project as well as by the IMFunder the StaffMonitoredProgram. These projects have focused&#13;
on helping the Government manage donor assistance, support good governance and economic&#13;
management, and carrying out detailed sectoral studies to preparefor in-depthreforms. Much&#13;
has been learned inthe process, as regards the selection ofpriority areas and implementation&#13;
mechanisms-butrenewedefforts are neededto helpthe Government pursuethe economic&#13;
reform processand to tackle the specific challenges associatedwith the decentralization process.&#13;
&#13;
Strengtheningof Local Capacitiesfor SoundEconomic Management&#13;
&#13;
53.     The component will provide capacity enhancement support to all dkpartements andall&#13;
municipalities (inthe form o ftechnical assistance, training, and equipment) as well as to the&#13;
local branchesofthe central revenue collection agencies. Activities financed under the Project&#13;
will focus on: (i)&#13;
                 gradually improving the preparation, execution, and monitoringof local&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                   21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
budgets; and (ii)   identifyinguntapped sources oflocal revenues, and helpingto de-bottleneck&#13;
collection efforts. Resources under the component will also be used to finance regular audits o f&#13;
budgetexecution (which will be communicatedto localNGOs and published inthe local press).&#13;
&#13;
54.      Duringthe first year o fimplementation, the Component will finance individualized&#13;
assessmento f capacity enhancement needs inall local collectivities. Activities for further&#13;
financing will be identified on the basis o f these assessmentsand on the overall&#13;
recommendations o f the Public Expenditure Review currently underway, so that they can be&#13;
tailored to each collectivity's specific situation.&#13;
&#13;
55.      Duringimplementation, activities to be fundedunderthe Projectwill be selectedjointly&#13;
by the Ministry o fFinance, the Ministry incharge o foverseeing local collectivities and the&#13;
relevant local collectivities inclose consultation with the Bank and the IMF. The Government&#13;
will formalize these needs through semiannual implementation andprocurement plans (including&#13;
terms o freference and technical specifications), which will be submitted by the Ministryo f&#13;
Finance to the Bank for no-objection. Once the no-objection i s provided, activities will be&#13;
procuredby the implementation unit, as per agreed procurement rules (which may include&#13;
further no-objections). An initialprocurementplanfor the first semester satisfactory to the Bank&#13;
has already been prepared.&#13;
&#13;
CapacityEnhancementfor Economic Reforms&#13;
&#13;
56.     Needs for institutional strengthening are expected to evolve rapidly as the process o f&#13;
decentralization andeconomic reform unfolds. Experience inother countries shows that&#13;
flexibility is key to providing the type o f support that i s needed infragile and rapidly-changing&#13;
post-conflict environments, such as Congo's. Experience also shows that capacity enhancement&#13;
activities similar to those to be financed under the component that have been funded inother&#13;
countries have proven very instrumental infacilitating the design and implementation o f critical&#13;
economic reforms. The design o f the component consists therefore o f two elements:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Mechanismsforflexibility - to ensure that responses canbe provided with the adequate&#13;
        degree o f flexibility throughout project implementation; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Narrow list ofpriority areas to avoid that the necessary flexibility results ina dispersion&#13;
                                       -&#13;
        o f efforts.&#13;
&#13;
57.     Mechanismsforflexibility. Support under the component will include the provision o f&#13;
external expertise, training, and equipment (such as computers) insupport o f capacity&#13;
enhancement activities inpriority areas. Specific needs will be identified by the Government&#13;
throughout the implementation period, inclose consultation with the Bank andthe IMFwherever&#13;
relevant. The Government will formalize these needs through semiannual implementation and&#13;
procurement plans (including terms o f reference and technical specifications), which will be&#13;
submittedbythe Ministry of Financeto the Bank for no-objection. Once the no-objection is&#13;
provided, activities will be procured by the implementationunit, as per agreed procurementrules&#13;
(which may include further no-objections). An initialprocurementplanfor the first semester&#13;
satisfactory to the Bankhas already beenprepared.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                 22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
58.     List ofpriority areas. Inview ofthe limitedresources available, selectivity i s critical.&#13;
The Project will therefore support only a limitedset of activities, aimed at addressingcritical&#13;
issues for which rapidprogress i s possible. Support will aimto complement efforts under the&#13;
Transparency and GovernanceCapacity EnhancementProject and IMFtechnical assistance&#13;
program, to implement soundeconomic governance andmacro-economic policies. Priorities&#13;
areas will be:&#13;
&#13;
        Continued implementation of the economicprogram supported by the Bretton Woods&#13;
        Institutions -through the financing of selected studies and audits, the strengtheningof&#13;
        institutional capacity incritical areas, andexternal assistancefor the design and'&#13;
        preparation ofkey technical measures;&#13;
&#13;
       Preparation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper; this will inparticular aimto&#13;
        support the transfer of experience from other countries, sectoral and thematic studies as&#13;
        may be needed, andthe overall facilitation ofthe PRSP process.&#13;
&#13;
       Implementation of thepublic service reform recently initiatedwith the support ofthe&#13;
        Bank; the reformis aimedat improvingpublic capacity to deliver key services, for which&#13;
       there i s strong Government ownership;&#13;
&#13;
       Fine-tuning of theforest reform initiated by the Government. This reform i s aimed at&#13;
       reforming forest institutions (which should focus onpolicy and monitoring functions&#13;
       while relinquishing production andother activities that are better performedby the&#13;
       private sector), improving governance (particularly interms o f law enforcement andlocal&#13;
       participation), and increasing revenuecollection inthe sector;&#13;
&#13;
       Decentralization. Support will aim to help establishat the central Government level&#13;
       transparent and effective mechanisms andinstitutional arrangements for fiscal transfersto&#13;
       "ddpartements" and municipalities. Activities funded under the Project may include&#13;
       technical expertise (e.g., to transfer experiencefrom other countries), training, and&#13;
       equipment. Fundswill also be available to finance regular audits andhelpadjust&#13;
       processes andprocedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0   Implementation of the telecommunications andpostal services reforms which are&#13;
       underway (and were developed with the support ofthe World Bank). These reforms aim&#13;
       inparticularto strengthen the legal andinstitutional framework (for telecommunications,&#13;
       postal services, and informationtechnology), as well as to restructure the Societe&#13;
       TClCcommunications du Congo (SOTELCO) and the SociCtC des Postesdu Congo&#13;
       (SOPECO) so as to improve service andpreparefor increasedprivate participation.&#13;
       Preparationfor these reforms is well advanced, andthey could be launched with&#13;
       relatively limitedadditional support.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                     23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Implementation&#13;
&#13;
59.     The component will be implemented underthe responsibility o f a Project Coordination&#13;
andImplementationUnit(PCIU) established inthe Ministry of Finance. The PCIUwill in&#13;
particular be responsible for procurement o f all works, goods, and services, for the component.&#13;
Part o fthe resources under the component will be used for financing the PCIU's operating costs,&#13;
as per a budget and staffing plan agreeable to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
CostBreakdown&#13;
&#13;
60.     The Component will finance a number o f activities, the exact nature and scope o f which&#13;
i s expected to evolve during implementation. An initial cost breakdown is detailed in the table&#13;

&#13;
Component D: Balance o f payments support (USS13 million)&#13;
&#13;
Objective&#13;
&#13;
61,     This component i s aimed at helping the Government put inplace adequate mechanisms&#13;
for the transfer o f fiscal resources from the central Government to the local collectivities - and&#13;
for the monitoring o f their effective use. It will complement efforts under Component C by&#13;
focusing on the audit and monitoring aspects and by providing balance o f payments support to&#13;
help finance critical imports to facilitate the effective delivery o f basic social services by local&#13;
collectivities.&#13;
&#13;
Current Status of the Economic Reform Program&#13;
&#13;
62.     Since the endo f the war, macro-economic stability has been restored, with contained&#13;
inflation (3.4 percent in2002), andeconomic growth (4.1 percent in2002). Over the last year,&#13;
an ambitious program o f in-depth structuralreforms was launched, inparticular inthe areas o f&#13;
economic governance, privatization, management o fthe oil sector, public expenditure&#13;
management andtransparency, and forestry. A Public Expenditure Review i s well underway and&#13;
i s expected to be finalized inthe coming months. It provides a framework for improved&#13;
transparency and effectiveness inthe use o f Government resources.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                    24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
63.     These reforms are supported by the Bretton Woods Institutions, inparticular within the&#13;
context o f an IMF SMP. Implementationto date i s encouraging. Provided performance i s&#13;
maintainedand adequate measures taken inkey areas, Congo could access a PRGF inFall 2003.&#13;
&#13;
64.     The situation at the local level, however, i s worrisome, as most local collectivities do not&#13;
have revenues commensurate with their new responsibilities, inparticular for social services&#13;
delivery. As the country moves towards decentralization, local expenditures are expected to rise&#13;
rapidly. Restorationand/or establishment o f fair andeffective revenue collection systems will&#13;
take time and a significant gap i s expected to emerge at least duringthe transition period. In&#13;
view o f the fiscal situation on the Government side, external assistance will be needed to help&#13;
finance this transitional gap andhence allow for the overall reformprogram to remain on track.&#13;
&#13;
65.     The Bank has gained experience inproviding such support, with the successful&#13;
implementation o fthe Post-Conflict Economic Recovery Credit. This credit played a key role in&#13;
the normalization o f Congo's relations with its external creditors andwas instrumental in&#13;
supporting the earlier stages o fthe economic reform process. Resources provided through that&#13;
project were putto good use andhave contributed to restoring minimal capacity for both&#13;
economic governance and social services delivery. The provision o f further support to the&#13;
balance o fpayments therefore appears a viable way to support the recovery process.&#13;
&#13;
Continued Debt Burden&#13;
&#13;
66.     With a stock o f debt estimated at over US$6 billion, Congo is one o fthe world's most&#13;
indebtedcountry per capita. Efforts are underway to settle arrears with major creditors, building&#13;
on the clearance o f Bank arrears inJuly 2001, But debt service has reached very highlevels and&#13;
increased from 60.4 percent o f Government revenues in2001 to 68.1 percent in2002.&#13;
&#13;
67.     Inclose coordinationwiththe IMF,the Bankhasproposed atwo-fold strategy to address&#13;
thisissue: (i) the burden, through an accessto the EnhancedHighlyIndebtedPoor&#13;
               reduce&#13;
Countries (HIPC) initiative as soon as economic performance allows; and(ii)      helpthe&#13;
Government increase its capacity to mobilize fiscal revenues (e.g., inthe forestry sector) and&#13;
control expenditure. Still, inthe short-term, the Government does not have sufficient roomto&#13;
supportkey activities necessary for economic and social recovery. External assistance is needed&#13;
to help face these challenges, and keep the overall program on track.&#13;
&#13;
Design&#13;
&#13;
68.     The Government is committedto implementing the type o freforms supported bythe&#13;
component. Inview o f the existing track record, and to avoid cross-conditionality with other&#13;
operations supporting the implementation o f the economic program, there will be no specific&#13;
macro-economic trigger for the release o f funds. This i s consistent with OP 8.50 (Operational&#13;
Policy on Emergency Recovery Assistance) under which the Project is prepared.&#13;
&#13;
69.     The positive list of imports which could be financed under the Project (listed inAppendix&#13;
C) includes a list o f items essential to support the recovery o f the economy, and o f the agriculture&#13;
sector inparticular. The fast disbursing component would contribute to stabilizing the macro&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                 25&#13;

&#13;
economy by reducing the fiscal deficit, andmakingadditional foreign exchange available.&#13;
Additional budgetary resources would permit the continuation o f key recovery programs,&#13;
otherwise likely to be affected by fiscal resource constraints caused by the needto respond to the&#13;
emergency. Inaggregate, the imports financed on Government's account andthe counterpart&#13;
generated fromprivate sector imports will be usedto support the transfer o f resources to local&#13;
Governments, so as to facilitate an effective delivery o f social services indepartementsand&#13;
smaller municipalities. Retroactive funding could cover imports contracted as o f April 1,2002,&#13;
upto anaggregate value o fUS$2.6million.&#13;
&#13;
70.     Balance o fpayments support provided under the Project will be disbursedinone tranche&#13;
upon effectiveness. Fundswill be deposited into a special deposit account opened inUS dollars&#13;
andheldinthe name o fthe Ministry o f Finance at the regional central bank (Banquedes Etats de&#13;
I'Afrique Centrale,BEAC). These resources willbe usedto constitute a counterpart fundthat&#13;
the Government can use to finance part o fthe fiscal transfers necessary for the proper&#13;
functioning o f local collectivities, including the resumption o f salary payments for key civil&#13;
servants. Implementation o f the component will be overseen andmonitored by the Ministryo f&#13;
Finance, and will be discussed within the context o fthe policy dialogue with the Bank.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                  26&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
A.         ProjectCoverageandImplementationPeriod&#13;
&#13;
71.      The Project will be implementedover four and ahalfyears (June 2003 to December&#13;
2007). This is expectedto allow for sufficient time to strengthencapacity inlocal governments&#13;
andNGOs ina gradual and sustainablemanner-as well as to overcome existing limitations on&#13;
institutional capacity to implement arelatively large program of community activities.&#13;
&#13;
72.     Activities under components A andB will cover all parts ofthe country except for the&#13;
municipalities o f Brazzaville and Pointe Noire (which correspondto about halfof Congo's 3&#13;
million inhabitants). Activities under component C will be implementedthroughout the country&#13;
as may be necessary.&#13;
&#13;
B.         ImplementationArrangements&#13;
&#13;
ComponentA&#13;
&#13;
73.     To facilitate rapid andeffective implementation of the priority rehabilitation activities,&#13;
this componentwill be implementedthrough a serviceagreementbetweenthe Governmentand&#13;
an international organization with extensive experience inCongo inworking with community-&#13;
based organizations, facilitatingconsultative processes, andmanaging small-scale rehabilitation&#13;
activities. Basedon a review of NGOs currently active inCongo and an assessment oftheir&#13;
capacity and qualifications, the Agence dYide b la Coope'ration Techniqueet au De'veloppement&#13;
(ACTED), was selectedby the Government inconsultation with the Bank as the executing entity&#13;
for component A (executing entity A).&#13;
&#13;
74.     ACTED has been active inCongo since 1997, and is currently implementing about US$2&#13;
million ayear o fprojects financed by various bilateral andmultilateral donors (ACTED'S&#13;
worldwide turnover is o f about US$20-25 million a year). ACTED has about 20 staff inCongo,&#13;
including 3 expatriates, andcurrently has active programs inthe Pool, Bouenza and Lecoumou&#13;
dkpartements. Supervision, procurement andaccounting activities are basedon international&#13;
standardpractices, andhave been reviewed by Bank Financial Management and Procurement&#13;
Specialists who found them adequate to implementa Bank-financed project. ACTED has&#13;
preparedanimplementationplanandhas identifiedadditional capacity to strengthenits team for&#13;
the implementation ofcomponent A.&#13;
&#13;
ComponentB&#13;
&#13;
75.     Similarly, component Bwill be implementedthrough a service contract betweenthe&#13;
Government and an international organization already active inCongo, and with extensive&#13;
experienceworking with community-based organizations, helping them develop their capacities&#13;
and implementing small-scale activities. Basedon areview of agencies active inCongo and an&#13;
assessment oftheir capacities andqualifications, the Government inconsultation with the Bank&#13;
has selectedthe UnitedNations Development Program (UNDP), which i s already implementing&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
similar activities (partly fundedby the Bank), as the executing entity for component B (executing&#13;
entity B).&#13;
&#13;
76.     The UNDP office was establishedinBrazzaville inthe 1970sand since thenithas&#13;
developed solidproject implementation capacity, with a particular focus on community-driven&#13;
activities and support to the local civil society. UNDP is implementing 10projects, including 3&#13;
(for US$6 million) directly. One of these projects is fundedby the Bankthrough a US$1 million&#13;
grant fromthe Post Conflict Fundand implementation is proceeding well. The organization&#13;
operates inmost dtpartementswith aparticular focus on the Pooland inthe Southernregions. It&#13;
has demonstratedcapacity to adjust to the guidelines andprocedures o f various bilateral donors,&#13;
including IDA. A Financial Management Assessment and a Procurement Assessment havebeen&#13;
carried out by specialized Bank staff, andprocesses andprocedureshave been found adequate&#13;
for implementation of Bank-funded activities.&#13;
&#13;
Component C&#13;
&#13;
77.     The component will be implementedby the PCIUestablished inthe Ministry of Finance.&#13;
A Director has been appointed, a Procurement Specialistwith experienceinimplementing Bank&#13;
projects has been identified, and recruitment of other staff i s expectedto be completed by July 1,&#13;
2003. Hands-on external support i s expectedto be provided under the Project inthe first months&#13;
of implementation, to helpthe PCIU become rapidly operational. The PCIU will also draw&#13;
extensively on the experienceacquired inimplementing the Transparency and Governance&#13;
Capacity Enhancement Project andthe Emergency Reconstruction, Rehabilitation, and Living&#13;
Conditions Improvement Project. Inparticular, this component ofthe Project will be&#13;
implementedwiththe sameprocurement, financial management, andreporting proceduresas for&#13;
the Transparency and Governance Capacity EnhancementProject, inaccordance with World&#13;
Bank guidelines andprocedures.&#13;
&#13;

goods and services.&#13;
&#13;
86.     Small GrantsAgreements (Community sub-projects). Under Component B, the Credit&#13;
andthe Grantwill finance small grants to local organizations (community sub-projects), for an&#13;
estimated total amount o f US$2.30 million. These organizations will include associations,&#13;
NGOs, communities, cooperatives andprivate organizations working with communities ineach&#13;
o fthe ten departements and four smaller municipalities. Beneficiaries will be selected through&#13;
transparent procedures acceptable to IDA, to be detailed inthe Operational Manual. They will&#13;
enter into contractual arrangements with the implementationagency (UNDP), as per standard&#13;
documents acceptable to IDA, to be detailed inthe Operational Manual. Contracts will not&#13;
exceed US$20,000 per organization per year. They may include procurement o f works, goods,&#13;
andservices, and will be executed by the beneficiaries, as per procurementprocedures&#13;
acceptable to IDA, to be detailed inthe Operational Manual. The implementation agency will be&#13;
responsible for monitoring the compliance with agreed procedures and the proper use o f Project&#13;
resources&#13;
&#13;
87.     Each implementation agency will be responsible for the quality o f the procurements and&#13;
adherence to Bankprocedures. Each implementation agency is expected to prepare an&#13;
Operational Manual acceptable to the Bank, which will spell out processes andprocedures for&#13;
selection o f activities andprocurement, as well as a procurement planfor works, goods, and&#13;
services to be procured during the first implementationsemester, as a condition o f effectiveness.&#13;
For each subsequent six-month period, the procurement plan will be updatedand submittedto&#13;
the Bank for review andapproval.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                 30&#13;

D.         DisbursementArrangements.&#13;
&#13;
88.     The IDA Credit and IDA Grant will finance 100 percent of all expenditures, net o ftaxes&#13;
and duties. The disbursement schedule i s expected to be as follows: 38 percent inFY04, 14&#13;
percent inFY05, 18 percent inFY06, 19 percent inFY07, and 11percent inFY08.&#13;
&#13;
ComponentsA and B&#13;
&#13;
89.     Payment conditions for the executing entities under Components A andB will be&#13;
specified inthe service agreements betweenthe Government and these entities (respectively&#13;
ACTED andUNDP). ACTED and UNDP will be expected to submit an invoice on a quarterly&#13;
basis to the Government Separate invoices will be submitted for the management fee for the&#13;
Components and for the funds released to finance the implementationo f local projects. The fees&#13;
will be calculated on the basis o f specifications inthe service agreements, the financing o f&#13;
activity will be based on an exhaustive list and cost details o f activities, inaccordance with&#13;
payment modalities contained inthe respective ACTED andUNDP service agreements. Upon&#13;
receipt o fthese invoices, the Government will forward them to the Bank within ten working&#13;
days. The Bankwill make paymentsdirectly to ACTED andUNDPrespectively.&#13;
&#13;
ComponentC&#13;
&#13;
90.      To facilitate implementation andreduce the volume o f withdrawal applications, a&#13;
Special Account will be opened inUS dollars ina commercial bank on terms and conditions&#13;
acceptable to IDA. The Special Account will be managed by the PCIUandwill finance all&#13;
eligible expenditures under component C. The authorized allocation will be US$600,000&#13;
corresponding to about four months o f eligible expenditures. When conditions for disbursement&#13;
for the relevant component are met, IDA will make an initial deposit, inthe amount o f&#13;
US$300,000 into the Special Account, representing fifty percent o fthe authorized allocations.&#13;
The remaining balance will be made available when the aggregate amount o f withdrawals from&#13;
the credit/grant account plus the total amount o f all outstanding special commitments entered&#13;
into by the Association shall be equal or exceed the equivalent o fUS$4,100,000. Inview o fthe&#13;
expected small size o fthe contracts, it is expected that a very large majority o fpayments will be&#13;
processedthrough the Special Accounts. Further deposits by IDA into the Special Accounts will&#13;
be made against monthly withdrawal applications supported by appropriate documents.&#13;
Withdrawal applications will be signed by the PCIUDirector or the Minister of Finance, as&#13;
designated authorized representatives o fthe Borrower.&#13;
&#13;
ComponentD&#13;
&#13;
91,     Uponapproval o f the Project, the Ministryo f Finance will open a Special Deposit&#13;
Account at the regional Central Bank (Bunque des Etuts de l 'Afrique Centrale, BEAC). IDA&#13;
will deposit the proceeds o fthe Credit under component D inthis account. The Ministryof&#13;
Finance i s expected to set up accounting andtracking arrangements, similar to those under the&#13;
Post-Conflict Economic Recovery Credit, to ensure that resource from the Credit are committed&#13;
andexpended inaccordance with the provisions o fthe Credit. Government expenditure&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                 31&#13;

Conflict Economic Rehabilitation Credit, approved inJuly 2001. Since then, they have been&#13;
reinforcedwithin the context of the ongoing Public Expenditure Reviewandwith hands-on&#13;
technical assistance from the IMF. The Ministryof Financei s expectedto set up accounting and&#13;
tracking arrangements, similar to those under the ERC, to ensure that resourcesfrom the Credit&#13;
are committed and expended inaccordance with the revised budgetary proceduresand&#13;
expendituretracking arrangements. The use of the finds depositedby the Bank inthe deposit&#13;
account will be subject to annual audits by auditors and on terms of reference acceptableto IDA.&#13;
&#13;
Use of Statements of Expenditures&#13;
&#13;
92.     Disbursementsfor all expenditureswill bemade against full documentation, except for&#13;
items of expendituresfor: (a) contracts for works, goods and equipmentinan amount inferior to&#13;
US$200,000; (b) contracts for consulting firms inan amount inferior to US$lOO,OOO; (c)&#13;
contracts for individualconsultants inan amount inferior to US$50,000; as well as all (d)&#13;
operating costs. Paymentsunder contractsbelowthose thresholds will be authorized on the basis&#13;
of Statementof Expenditures(SOEs). All supporting documentation for SOEs will be retained&#13;
at a suitable location and will be made readily accessiblefor review by IDA supervision missions&#13;
and external auditors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
E.      FinancialManagement,Reporting, andAuditing&#13;
&#13;
Financial Management&#13;
&#13;
93.     The executing entity for each componentwill be responsible for financial management.&#13;
A financial managementassessment ofbothACTED andUNDP has beencarried out, andboth&#13;
organizationshave beenfound to have financial management systems (FMS) satisfactory to the&#13;
IDA. However, inorder to strengthentheproject managementandfinancial management&#13;
system, an agreed action planhas been developed. This action plan-part of the FMS&#13;
assessment report -is available infiles. The financial management system of the PCIUwill be&#13;
developed inthe coming period, building on systems existing for other Government Project&#13;
ImplementationUnitsresponsible for ongoing operations -and its effective establishment&#13;
(including recruitment of key staff) will be a condition of effectiveness. Details are provided in&#13;
Appendix E.&#13;
&#13;
94.     Payments to contractors under ComponentsA and C will beprocessedas per standard&#13;
practices. Payments by UNDP will be made on the basis of financing agreements signed with&#13;
the entities as describedinthe Operational manual. UNDP, after verifying the documents and&#13;
checking the availability o f funds will processthe payment.&#13;
&#13;
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs)&#13;
&#13;
95.     UNDP is familiar withthe proceduresfor quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports on&#13;
IDA-financed projects. The PCIU andACTED are expected to receive training inthe use of&#13;
these proceduresby Boardpresentation. Bank guidelines regarding FMRs were discussedwith&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                             32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
all three organizations by Bank Financial Management Specialistsduring appraisal. The three&#13;
organizations have agreedto submit quarterly FMRswithin 45 days following the first day of&#13;
each calendar quarter after effectiveness. The formats andthe contents of the FMRsandthe&#13;
Annual Financial Statements will be discussedand agreedprior to effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
AnnualAudits&#13;
&#13;
96.     The PCIU at the Ministry ofFinance will be responsiblefor organizing the annual audits&#13;
ofthe overall project. The annual financial statements, the movementsinthe SpecialAccount&#13;
(for component C) andthe Statementsof Expenditures (SOEs) ofthe implementation agencies&#13;
will be audited separatelyby anexternal auditor selectedwithterms ofreferencesacceptableto&#13;
IDA. The cost ofthe audit will be financedunder componentC ofthe project. For the purposes&#13;
of the audit ACTED and UNDP have agreedto keep inplace the original of accounting&#13;
documents and invoices. The terms of referencesfor the external auditor will be developed&#13;
immediately after effectiveness and submittedto the Bank for approval.&#13;
&#13;
F.      Readinessfor implementationandconditionsof effectiveness&#13;
&#13;
97.     The Ministryof Finance has establishedthe PCIU, and appointed aPCIUDirector as&#13;
well as key staff, andhas agreedto use the same systemsandproceduresusedbythe PCIUfor&#13;
the ongoing Transparency and Capacity Building Support Project. BothACTED andUNDP&#13;
have experienceinimplementing activities similar to those under componentsA andB (although&#13;
not inthe same geographical areas). They have preparedProject ImplementationPlans which&#13;
have beendiscussedwith the Government andthe Bank.&#13;
&#13;
98.     There will be no conditionfor Boardpresentation. The government hasconfirmed that it&#13;
agrees with the FinancingAgreement as negotiated. The Credit andthe Grant will be effective&#13;
after the Bank has received confirmation, through a Legal Opinion, that the Financing&#13;
Agreement has been duly ratified; andafter the following conditions have beenmet:&#13;

&#13;
100.     Reviews will be carried out every year after effectiveness to assess progress, achievement&#13;
o f overall objectives, role o f the different partners, and to eventually reorient the Project if&#13;
neededto ensure achievement o f objectives. The PCIUwill be responsible for: (i)         preparingthe&#13;
necessary documentation for the reviews, and (ii)     planningthe review meeting. Inparticular, the&#13;
PCIUwill contract an independent consultant for each review (under financing from Component&#13;
C) to review and assess the progress o f implementation andprepare the necessary documentation&#13;
for the review. The reviews will involve visits to selected sites for first-handassessment o f&#13;
executing entities' performance.&#13;

101,     The Project is classified as environmental category B becauseno activity funded under&#13;
the Project is expected to have a significant negative environmental or social impact. It should&#13;
be notedthat the emergency was inno way relatedto inappropriate environmental management&#13;
practices. Operational manuals to be prepared for components A and B will include screening&#13;
procedures, to ensure that no activity with a potential negative environmental or social impact is&#13;
selected for financing, without appropriate mitigation measures. These procedures will be&#13;
adjusted to reflect the findings andrecommendations o f an Environmental and Social&#13;
Management Framework and a Resettlement Policy Framework to be preparedwithinone year&#13;
o f effectiveness (as allowed for emergency projects processed under OP 8.50).&#13;

                                   VII.      BENEFITSAND RISKS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A.          Benefits&#13;
&#13;
102.     The proposedProject is expectedto contribute to Congo's stabilization andrecovery&#13;
process. Inparticular, it will provide four types of benefits: (i)  contribute to improvingliving&#13;
conditions inareas which to date have received limitedexternal support and where poverty is&#13;
acute, by financing priority investments; (ii) maintain the pace o f economic reforms, in&#13;
                                                 help&#13;
particular inthe key areas ofpublic service reform, decentralization, PRSPpreparation, forestry,&#13;
andtelecommunications; (iii) strengthen civil society inrural areas and small towns, which&#13;
                                  help&#13;
i s a key element for local governance and improved service delivery inthese areas; and (iv)&#13;
facilitate the decentralization processand the effective provisionof basic social servicesby&#13;
supporting economic management inlocal collectivities which have recently been entrusted with&#13;
important responsibilities inthese areas.&#13;
&#13;
B.         RisksandMitigationMeasures&#13;
&#13;
103.     Inlight ofthe Republic of Congo's fragile political situation andits relatively weak&#13;
implementation capacity, the risks are significant. Implementation o fthe Project andthe&#13;
materialization o fthe expectedbenefits could bejeopardized ifone o f several criticalrisks came&#13;
to materialize, including:&#13;
&#13;
         Regional instability and threats to thepeaceprocess. The peaceprocess inCongo is&#13;
         intrinsically linkedto progressthroughout the region. Wars and civil conflicts have&#13;
         engulfed a large part o f Central Africa over the last decade, including three of Congo's&#13;
         five neighbors. Recovery cannot be isolated, andwill require a stabilization of the entire&#13;
         sub-regionto be sustainable.&#13;
&#13;
         The Project aims to helpreduce the odds for renewedconflict inCongo. These actions&#13;
         are expectedto be complemented by parallel programs both in Congo and inother&#13;
         affected countries inthe region with a view to promoting an overall returnto stability.&#13;
         The situation inCongo itselfwill be closely monitored (inconjunction with key&#13;
         bilaterals), so as to allow for the mitigationof political and social risks as they emerge.&#13;
&#13;
         Localized eruptions of violence. Over the last years, there have been sporadic explosions&#13;
         ofviolence insome areas (mostly inthe Pool Region). While tensions have subsided,&#13;
         andagreementshave been signedwith all rebel groups, violence or insecurity could re-&#13;
         emerge inlocalized areas and compromise Project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
         The Project will be implementedonly inthose areas where Bank and implementation&#13;
         agencies staff can effectively travel to supervise activities. Incase of localized&#13;
         insecurity, implementation may be temporarily suspendedby the implementation agency&#13;
         -butshouldresumeassoonasorderhasbeenrestored.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                               35&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0   Dfjculties on the reform path. Strong anti-reform constituencies remain influential in&#13;
       Congo -withinthe administration as well as among private operators. Recent reforms&#13;
       could be overturned by a newteam (although this will become more and more difficult as&#13;
       time passes and reforms are takingroots) or delayed by unwillingstakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
       The Project aims to help strengthen the pro-reform constituencies to mitigate this risk.&#13;
       Progress will be closely monitored by the Bretton Woods Institutionsthrough an&#13;
       intensive policy dialogue, so as to react to slippages early on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0   Compromised administrative capacity. After a decade o f conflict and instability,&#13;
       implementation capacity remains limited, whether for Government-initiated policy&#13;
       reforms or for Bank-fundedprojects. This could become a critical obstacle to the&#13;
       effective implementation o f the reform program and support projects.&#13;
&#13;
       The proposed implementation arrangements build on early success inimplementing other&#13;
       projects inCongo. This experience shows that difficulties can be overcome, but regular&#13;
       reviews will pay particular attentionto the issue o f implementation performance, and&#13;
       may propose adjustments to strengthen it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0   Fiduciary risk. Although the Government has launchedan effort to attack corruption, the&#13;
       fiduciary environment inCongo remains risky. This is a critical risk, which is reflected&#13;
       inthe riskratingfor procurementandfinancial management.&#13;
&#13;
       The proposedimplementation arrangements have been designed to minimize this risk, by&#13;
       relying on three different executing entities (including two foreign entities) and by&#13;
       ensuring that proper safeguards inprocurement and financial management procedures are&#13;
       inplace. Inview o fexperience to date inimplementing Bank-fundedoperations in&#13;
       Congo, such arrangements should be adequate to mitigate the fiduciary risks.&#13;
&#13;
104.   Itshould beunderlinedthat while the risks of actionare significant, the risks o finaction&#13;
may be even higher ina context like Congo, where there have been three rounds o fviolent&#13;
conflict over the last decade. International support i s critical for the Government, andthe&#13;
Congolese society at large, to break the conflict trap.&#13;

the procurementsand adherence to Bank procedures. The tasks ofthe executing entities will&#13;
comprise: (a) maintaining registers of all interested bidders; (b) maintaining a detailed list o f&#13;
technical specifications of goods and services to be financed by the project; (c) preparing and&#13;
updating procurement plans andcalendars; (d) preparing and/or finalizing bidding documents&#13;
andrequests for proposals; (e) preparing bidevaluation reports; (f) approving contracts; (g)&#13;
processinginternational and local price quotations; (h) receiving o f goods and services and&#13;

&#13;
ProcurementCapacityAssessment&#13;
&#13;
108.   A procurementcapacity assessment ofthe executing entityA (ACTED) was carried out&#13;
during project appraisal, to confirm procurement capacity ofthese agencies. The result is&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                41&#13;
&#13;
includedinan action plandrawn upto enhance procurement capacity before and during project&#13;
implementation, includingtechnical assistance andtraining. For the executing agency for&#13;
Component B (UNDP), which will haveto handleactivities of a limitedsize (less than&#13;
US$20,000) procurement capacity was deemedadequate for the execution ofthe project, which&#13;
will be executedon the basis of a Manual of Procedures. As regards Component Cysince the&#13;
PCIUis recently created, it is not possibleto assess its procurement capacity. However, the core&#13;
staff ofthe PCIUwill include a senior procurement agent familiar with World Bank's&#13;
procurementprocedures as reflected inthe Terms of Reference approvedby the Bank. The&#13;
senior procurement agent will: (i) all procurement activities ofthe Project; (ii)&#13;
                                    monitor                                              supervise&#13;
compliance by the executing entities withthe agreedprocurement guidelines for the execution of&#13;
Components A and By(iii) enhance capacities of executing entities which have insufficient&#13;
                            help&#13;
procurement capacities as needed.Procurementprocedures and responsibilities inthe PCIU are&#13;
identical to those underthe Transparency andGovernance Capacity Enhancement Project&#13;
currently under implementation. The recruitmentof corresponding staff, inamanner satisfactory&#13;
to the Bank, is a condition o f effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
ProcurementPlan&#13;
&#13;
109.    For component Cya draft ProcurementPlan for goods and servicesto beprocured during&#13;
the first implementation semester of the Project has been discussedduring appraisalandhas been&#13;
agreedupon betweenthe Government andthe Bank during negotiations. For each subsequent&#13;
period, an annual procurement planwill bepreparedand submittedto the Bankfor review and&#13;
approval. These annual plans will include procedures for procurement, contract packagesfor&#13;
goods, works, and consultants services and training, estimated cost and the procurement/&#13;
selectionmethod. It is mandatory that all procurement be carried out inaccordance with the&#13;
formally agreedannual procurement plan (original and formally up-dated).&#13;
&#13;
Procurementmethods&#13;
&#13;
110.    Procurementof Works. The project will finance works contracts under components A, By&#13;
and C for an estimatedtotal amount of US$8.60 million equivalent. This will include&#13;
rehabilitation and improvement of existing social infrastructure (e.g., primary schools, health,&#13;
community centers) and economic infrastructure (e.g., water, markets, slaughterhouses,&#13;
transport, and energy), and labor-intensive rehabilitation works. Under component A, no&#13;
contract is expectedto exceedUS$200,000. Undercomponent Byno contract is expectedto&#13;
exceedUS$20,000. Works will beprocured through National Competitive Biddingfor contracts&#13;
estimatedto cost less than US$200,000 and more thanUS$50,000. Small works estimatedto&#13;
cost less than US$50,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$3.00 million equivalent&#13;
may beprocured under lump-sum,fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations&#13;
obtainedfrom three qualified domestic contractors invitedinwriting to bid. The invitation shall&#13;
includeadetailed descriptionof the works, includingbasic specifications, the required&#13;
completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptableto IDA, andrelevant drawings where&#13;
applicable. The awards will be madeto the contractors who offer the lowest price quotation for&#13;
the requiredwork, provided they demonstratethey havethe experienceandresources to&#13;
completethe contract successfully.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                 42&#13;
&#13;
 111.    Procurementof Goods. The project will finance the purchaseof goods under components&#13;
A, B, andC, for anestimatedtotal amount ofUS$6.80 millionequivalent. Thiswill include:(i)&#13;

equipmentfor the rehabilitation of social and economic infrastructure. Undercomponent A and&#13;
Cyno contract is expectedto exceedUS$200,000. But contracts abovethis amount will be&#13;
procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Under component B, no contract is&#13;
expectedto exceedUS$20,000. Most of the goods will be procured as packagesthrough: (i)&#13;
National Competitive Bidding(NCB) when costing betweenUS$50,000 and US$200,000; (ii)&#13;
Shopping (based on the evaluation of at least three quotations and inaccordancewithprovisions&#13;
of paragraph3.5 and 3.6 of the Guidelines) for contractsbelow US$50,000.&#13;
&#13;
112.    For NCB procedures, the Government has given assurances during negotiations that: (i)&#13;
bidswill be advertisedinnational newspaperswith wide circulation; (ii)    methods used inthe&#13;
evaluation of bids andthe award of contracts are made known to all biddersandare not applied&#13;
arbitrarily; (iii)&#13;

BiddingDocuments to beusedfor NCB will bereviewed by IDA before effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
113.    National andInternational Shopping solicitations will (a) be issued inwriting to at least&#13;
three reputable suppliers (it may be better to approachfive or six suppliers because not all three&#13;
suppliersmay respond, so that at leastthree competitive quotations are received), (b) include&#13;
specifications, and ifgoods are not immediately available, the delivery time, (c) give the&#13;
estimated cost, including cost of inlandtransportation and insurance, (d) be openedat the same&#13;
time for evaluation, and (e) inthe case of International shopping quotations, be solicited from at&#13;
least three suppliers intwo different countries.&#13;
&#13;
114.    Equipment,suchas computers andvehicles to cost less thanUS$200,000 canbeprocured&#13;
from the UnitedNations Agencies (IAPSO), upto anaggregate of US$0.5 million equivalent, in&#13;
accordancewith the Bank Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
115.    Direct Contracting. Goods which must bepurchasedfrom the original supplierto be&#13;
compatible with existing equipment or are o f aproprietary nature up to an aggregate amount no&#13;
to exceedUS$200,000 equivalent, may, with the Association's prior agreement, beprocured in&#13;
accordancewith the provisions of paragraph3.7 of the Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
116.    Procurementof imports (under Component D). The Project will finance the import of&#13;
goods for atotal amount of US$13 million equivalent, which will be procured undermodified&#13;
international competitive biddingprocedures. Commonly traded commodities will beprocured&#13;
under simplifiedprocedures, inaccordancewiththe provisions ofparagraph 2.65 ofthe&#13;
Guidelines. Public sector imports estimatedto cost less the US$750,000 per contract will be&#13;
procured under contracts awarded inaccordancewith the Government's establishedprocurement&#13;
proceduressatisfactory to the Association, inaccordance with the provisions ofparagraph2.63&#13;
and 2.64 ofthe Guidelines. Imports by the private sector, estimatedto cost less than&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                  43&#13;

 paragraph 2.63 and 2.64 o f the Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
 117.     Consultancv Services. The Project will finance the contracting o f consultancy services&#13;
 under components A, B, and C, for an estimated total amount o f US$6.80 million equivalent.&#13;
 This will include studies, technical assistance, and training services. The standard Request for&#13;
 Proposal, as developed by the Bank, will be used for appointment o f consultants as well as the&#13;
 Sample form of Evaluation Report for the Selection o f Consultants. Simplified contracts will be&#13;
 used for short-term assignments, i.e. those not exceeding six months, carried out by firms or&#13;
 individual consultants. To ensure that priority is given to the identificationo f suitable and&#13;
qualifiednational consultants, short-lists for contracts estimated at or less than US$lOO,OOO&#13;
equivalent may be comprised entirely of national consultants (inaccordance withthe provisions&#13;
o fparagraph 2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines), provided that a sufficient number o f qualified&#13;
individual or firms (at least three) are available. However, ifforeign firms have expressed&#13;
interest, they would not be excluded from consideration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     0   Firms. Such services are expected to include: (i)  professional services for communities&#13;
         andlocal governments; and (ii) and audits for implementation o fkey economical&#13;
                                          studies&#13;
         reforms (including inthe forestry and telecommunications sector). All firms will be&#13;
         recruitedthrough Quality and Costs Based Selection (QCBS) procedures. For contracts&#13;
         estimated to cost less than US$50,000, firms may be recruitedthroughConsultant's&#13;
         Qualification (CQ) procedures.&#13;
&#13;
    0    Individuals. Individuals will be recruited where a firm is not needed, for contracts, which&#13;
         are not expected to exceed US$50,000. Such individuals will be selected and recruited&#13;
         on the basis o f C V and references inaccordance with Part V o f the Consultants'&#13;
         Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
118.     Service agreements. The Project will finance operating costs o f the implementation&#13;
agencies for components A and B through service agreements between the Government and each&#13;
of these agencies. Inview ofthe nature o fthe activities to be undertaken, which require specific&#13;
qualification and local experience, and inview o f the lack o f alternative implementingpartners&#13;
with adequateexperience inCongo, these service agreements will be entered into under single-&#13;
source selection procedures (as per Consultants Guidelines, paragraph 3.9). Operating costs will&#13;
include: (a) expenditure for the contracting o f auxiliary personnel required for the&#13;
implementation o fthe project; (b) expenditure and supplies for the operation and maintenance o f&#13;
facilities required for the implementation o fthe project (such as expenditures for office supplies,&#13;
rental fees, services, operation and maintenance of equipment financed out o f the proceeds o fthe&#13;
Credit and the Grant); (c) expenditure for domestic andinternational travel and per diems related&#13;
to project implementationactivities; and (d) overheads. Operating costs for the implementation&#13;
agency for component C will also be financed under the Project. All procurement withinthis&#13;
category shall be done according to the procedures defined above for goods and services.&#13;
&#13;
119.     Small Grants Agreements. Under Component B, the Project will finance small grants to&#13;
local organizations, for an estimated total amount o f US$2.30 million. These organizations will&#13;
include associations, NGOs, communities, cooperatives andprivate organizations working with&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                               44&#13;

&#13;
Advertising&#13;
&#13;
120.    Since a large portionof the Credit andthe Grant funds will beusedfor technical&#13;
assistance and consulting assignments, early attention will be given to advanceplanning of&#13;
recruitment and timely search for expressions of interest through international advertising to&#13;
obtain the best possible pool of candidatesfrom which strong short lists can be compiled. A&#13;
generalprocurement notice (GPN) will bepreparedand issued uponBoard Approval inthe&#13;
UnitedNations Development Business listing all contractsabove US$200,000 for consultants. It&#13;
will be updatedannually for any outstanding major procurement. Specific ProcurementNotices&#13;
(SPN) for works to be procured by QCBS will be advertised inthe national press of wide&#13;
distribution andinternationally. The related bidding documents, as applicable, will not be&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                  45&#13;
&#13;
released-or the short list for consultant services will not be prepared -before eight weeks after&#13;
the GPN has beenpublished. Expressions o f interest for contracts to be procured under N C B&#13;
will be advertised inat least three nationalnewspapers of wide circulation and sufficient time&#13;
will be allowed to obtain biddocuments andto prepare bids.&#13;
&#13;
IDA Review&#13;
&#13;
121. Draft standard biddingdocuments for N C B will be reviewed and agreed upon with IDA&#13;
withinthe context of the finalization o fthe Operational Manuals, to be submittedas a condition&#13;
o f effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
122.    Prior Review. All ICB and all direct contracts for works and goods will be subject to&#13;
IDA'sprior review, inaccordance with paragraph 2, Appendix 1o fthe guidelines. Also, for&#13;
each procurementmethod (for works: quotations; for goods: national competitive bidding,&#13;
shopping; for services: QC,recruitment o f individual consultants), the first three contracts will&#13;
be subject to IDA's prior review.&#13;
&#13;
123.    All consultingcontracts for costingUS$lOO,OOO equivalent or more for firms and&#13;
equivalent US$50,000 or more for individuals, the first three contracts under this threshold&#13;
would be subject to IDA prior review. Itwill concern the qualifications, experience, all terms o f&#13;
reference and terms o f employment o fthe consultants. Any amendments to existing contracts&#13;
raising their values to levels equivalent or above the prior review thresholds are subject to IDA&#13;
review. It would be also applied to all single-source selection o f consultants, including: Annual&#13;
training plans for local and overseas training and workshops, including terms o f reference and&#13;
estimated budgets, he program, containing names o f candidates, content o f courses, periods of&#13;
training, and selection o ftraining institutions. Prior review i s expected to amount to about 30&#13;
percent o f the total value o fthe works, goods, and services contracts through prior review.&#13;
&#13;
124.    Post review. IDA will also review 15 percent o fthe total number o f contracts through&#13;
post-review. Inthe event samples ofpost reviews indicate major problems, additional reviews,&#13;
financed by the Borrower, should cover the remaining portion of contracts. The use o f IDA's&#13;
standardbiddingdocuments will considerably expedite the prior review process as IDA review&#13;
will primarilyfocus on invitations to bid, biddata sheets, contract data, technical specifications,&#13;
bill o fquantitieskhedule ofrequirement andother contract specific items. The implementation&#13;
agencies will be requiredto maintain all relevant procurement documentation for subsequent&#13;
review by IDA. The implementation agencies will submit to IDA periodic procurement&#13;
schedules detailing each procurement package inprogress and completed as part o f the normal&#13;
project reporting exercise.&#13;

municipalities andrural areas. Such support is criticalto help mitigate the ongoing social crisis&#13;
inthe target areas, to createopportunities for communities which are amongthe mostdestitute,&#13;
andto facilitate the continued implementation ofthe economic reform and decentralization&#13;
programs.&#13;
&#13;
Project structure and costing&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
129.   Three implementing agencies will be directly involvedinthe managementofthe project&#13;
funds namely the Project Coordination andImplementation Unitwithinthe Ministryof Finance&#13;
(PCIU), ACTED, andUNDP.&#13;
&#13;
   0   ThePCIU (Agence de Gestion de Projet) has beencreatedwithin the Ministryof&#13;
       Finance. It will coordinate project implementation and directly managethe funds&#13;
       allocated under component C.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0   ACTED is anNGO basedinParis, France and operating worldwide. Its consolidated&#13;

&#13;
11) Strengths andweaknesses&#13;
&#13;
130.    UNDP is familiar with the procedures for quarterly FMRsandannual audits of IDA&#13;
financed-projects. ACTED and the PCIU are expectedto receive training inthe use of these&#13;
procedures.&#13;
&#13;
131.    The following chart outlined the issues identifiedduring the FMS assessment andthe&#13;
correspondingremedial actions.&#13;
&#13;
                     Issue                     Agency               Remedial action&#13;
    Accountants are not familiar with the      ACTED      Train staff on Bank's FMS&#13;
    Bank's FMSrequirements (reporting                     requirements.&#13;
    andmonitoring).&#13;

submittedto the Bank for approval. The Auditor will express separate opinionon each&#13;
implementation agency involvedinthe project andthe report will be submittedto IDA within six&#13;
months after the end of eachfiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
142.    ACTED activities are audited by an independentexternal auditor. The audit for 2001&#13;
activities was unqualified. The annual statementswill be audited by the auditor selectedby the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                               50&#13;

agreementbetween IDA andUNDP, the Bank will exercise the option of asking for annual&#13;
audits of UNDP Brazzaville expendituresunder the Project. Financial statements are preparedin&#13;
Brazzaville, and the original vouchers and supporting documents are kept inBrazzaville, which&#13;
makes it possible to the auditor to audit Brazzaville expenses inthe field.&#13;
&#13;
VII) Reportingand monitoring&#13;
&#13;
144.    IDA'Srequirementsas regardssubmissionofquarterly Financial ManagementReports&#13;
(FMRs) will have to be agreeduponwith the PCIUat the Ministry ofFinancepriorto&#13;

generatingaccurate and timely data andreporting as requiredby IDA. The software will have to&#13;
beoperational withinthree months after effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
149.    ACTED Accounting system is base on SAGA software that is able to manage projects&#13;
and subprojects separately. This software requires some adjustmentsto helpproducetimely and&#13;
accurate information for managing and monitoringproject activities.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                 51&#13;

            Republic of Congo - Emergency Recovery and
            Community Support Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Emergency Recovery
            and Community Support Project for the Republic of Congo is
            to assist the recovery of communities living in smaller
            municipalities and rural areas (i.e. all areas outside the
            two main cities of  Brazzaville and Pointe Noire). The
            program comprises four components: (i) Financing of priority
            local investments; (ii) Support to community organizations
            (iii) Capacity enhancement for central and local
            governments; and (iv) Balance of payments support. The
            Project is  expected to assist Congo's stabilization
            and recovery process by: (i) contributing to improving
            living conditions in areas which to date have received
            limited external support and where poverty is  acute; (ii)
            helping strengthen civil society in rural areas and small
            towns; (iii) facilitating the decentralization process and
            the effective provision of basic social services outside
            Brazzaville and Pointe Noire; and (iv) helping maintain the
            pace of economic reforms. The main risks are the possibility
            of renewed violence in some areas, difficulties on the path
            to reform, and a compromised administrative capacity for implementation.
