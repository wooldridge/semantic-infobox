                                    I.BACKGROUND&#13;
&#13;
1.       Senegal i s located on the West Coast o f Africa and i s part o f the West African&#13;
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). With a population estimated at about 10&#13;
million, its economy i s dominated by a few strategic sectors, including groundnut,&#13;
fisheries, and services. The role of the agricultural sector has declined over time, from&#13;
almost 15 percent of GDP in 1960 to 7 percent in 2004. The informal sector accounts for&#13;
about 60 percent o f its economy. Its rural economy frequently suffers from drought, and&#13;
lacks access to basic services and infrastructure, leading to low productivity, high&#13;
emigration and higher poverty rates inrural areas. As a result, it i s estimated that almost&#13;
half o f the population lives in cities, including 30 percent in Dakar.        This ratio is&#13;
projected to increase up to 60 percent by 2015.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Over the past years, Senegal has enjoyed a stable political climate, and has&#13;
remained largely unaffected by regional instability. A peace agreement was signed inthe&#13;
Casamance at the end o f 2004, generating donor support for the construction effort,&#13;
including from the World Bank. InApril 2000, Mr.Abdoulaye Wade, third President o f&#13;
the Republic of Senegal, and a new Government assumed office, representing the first&#13;
transition to another politicalparty since independence. A new Constitution, approved in&#13;
January 2001, reducedthe lengtho f the presidential term from seven to five years and the&#13;
unlimited number of terms to two. Legislative elections were concluded in April 2001,&#13;
saw a majority o f seats in Parliament won by the President's Party (Senegalese&#13;
Democratic Party). The next eight months will see an increase inpolitical activities with&#13;
legislative and presidential elections scheduledto take place inFebruary 2007.&#13;
&#13;
                11.RECENTMACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE&#13;
&#13;
3.        Over the past decade, real GDP grew on average by about 5 percent annually,&#13;
marking the first sustained increase in average per capita growth in Senegal since&#13;
independence.     The authorities continued to implement appropriate macroeconomic&#13;
policies in 2004 and 2005, consistent with Senegal's three-year arrangement under the&#13;
IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The Government maintained its&#13;
focus on enhancing revenue mobilization and a tight control on current expenditure,&#13;
while allowing for further increases in capital and pro-poor spending. Supported by a&#13;
well-targeted fiscal stimulus and a moderate easing o f monetary conditions by the Central&#13;
Bank o f West African States, the economy remained on a solid growth and low inflation&#13;
trajectory.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                      - 2 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.         Economic performance was strong in2004 and 2005. Despite rising petroleum&#13;
prices and the adverse consequences o f the locust invasion, real GDP growth is estimated&#13;
to have exceeded 6 percent, supported by the dynamism o f the telecommunication and&#13;
construction sectors. While industrial activity slowed down as oil prices rose, the impact&#13;
onthe overall economy was limited. Inflationremained subdued, with the annual average&#13;
CPI risingby about 0.5 percent in2004 and 1.8 percent in2005, reflectingthe low weight&#13;
o f energy in the CPI basket and limited rise in some food prices owing to abundant&#13;
supply.&#13;
&#13;
5.         Although the overall fiscal deficit increased to 3.3 and 3.5 percent of GDP in&#13;
2004 and 2005, the fiscal stance remained consistent with the authorities' goal o f&#13;
preserving debt sustainability.              Public sector external debt declined by about 12&#13;
percentage points, to 42.8 percent o f GDP at end-2005. This good performance reflected&#13;
larger than expected revenues and grants, an accumulationo f deposits o f public entities at&#13;
the treasury, and a decline in current expenditures.'               It was also the result of a series of&#13;
tax reforms aimed at reducing tax rates and broadening the tax base, especially on direct&#13;
taxation, paving the way to further tax reforms in 2005 and 2006. These developments&#13;
offset a sharp increase in capital expenditures caused by a faster than expected rate o f&#13;
project implementation, notably in projects funded by external sources.                             Spending&#13;
irregularities o f about 1percent of GDP occurred inmid-2003 (but came to light inJune&#13;
2004), requiring the authorities, in consultation with the Bank and the IMF, to adopt a&#13;
series of measuresaimed at improving procurement practices, including curtailing the use&#13;
o f emergency procedures (without competitive tender).2&#13;
&#13;
6.         The recent economic growthhas been associated with a widening of the current&#13;
account deficit from 6.0 percent o f GDP in 2002 to 7.6 percent o f GDP in 2005. This&#13;
deterioration was driven by strong domestic demand, mainly from the public sector, and&#13;
lackluster export performance. However, substantial private capital inflows, combined&#13;
with debt relief, led to an increase of 23 percent in the net international reserves o f the&#13;
Central Bank. The gross official reserves reached about 4.7 months o f imports at the end&#13;
o f 2005.&#13;
&#13;
7.         The macroeconomic objectives for 2006 include real GDP growth of about 4.5&#13;
percent and consumer price inflation of about 2.6 percent, a slight deterioration due to&#13;
two shocks (permanent increase in international oil prices and the financial crisis in the&#13;
largest industrial company in Senegal).3 The overall fiscal deficit (including grants), i s&#13;

Update, June 2006.&#13;

PRGF, January 2006.&#13;
3 The macroeconomic projections for 2006 are being revised around a GDP growth o f 4.0 percent and&#13;
higher fiscal and current account deficits as the result o f several factors that took place during the first&#13;
semester o f 2006. While it i s difficult to quantify the expected impact o f higher international oil prices on&#13;
domestic economic growth, the Government estimates indicate that a US$5 per barrel increase inoil prices&#13;
above the current World Economic Outlook projections would cut average annual GDP growth rate by&#13;
about 0.6 percentage points during 2006-2010, and would worsen the external current account deficit by&#13;
about 0.6 percent o f GDP per year during the same period. The financial crisis in the chemical company&#13;
(ICs) may induce a decline inGDP growth o f about 1percent according to recent government's estimates.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
expected to increase to about 4.0-4.3 percent o f GDP, partly because of compensating&#13;
measures required to absorb external shocks (oil price and flood) and higher&#13;
infrastructure pend ding,^ but it should be almost entirely financed by higher tax revenues&#13;
and external resources. The external current account deficit (including official transfers),&#13;
i s projected to remain around 7.6 percent o f GDP in 2006, as a result o f the larger than&#13;
expected energy imports and the lack o f impetus in exports. As discussed in the next&#13;
section, giventhe favorable initial macro-economic conditions, low debt levels, absence&#13;
o f central bank financing, and little risk of crowding out the private sector from the credit&#13;
market, such a level o f fiscal and external deficits should be accommodated without&#13;
underminingmacroeconomic stability.&#13;

      111.    MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
&#13;
8.         The medium-term scenario i s based on real GDP annual growth o f about 5&#13;
percent and continued low inflation during 2007-10. This growth rate is about the same&#13;
level as the average growth rate since the devaluation o f the CFAF in 1994.                             Its&#13;
attainment would require the continuous implementation o f sound macroeconomic&#13;
policies, market-oriented structural reforms, and an efficient government investment&#13;
program. Private savings should increase moderately, facilitated by rising real per capita&#13;
income and financial sector development. Reflecting these trends, the external current&#13;
account deficit (including official transfers) would decline marginally from the projected&#13;
7.6 percent of GDP in2006, to around 6.3 percent by 2010. While globally positive, the&#13;
medium-term outlook is subject to a number o f downside risks. Senegal's economy&#13;
remains vulnerable to exogenous shocks, including higher oil prices, severe droughts,&#13;
locust invasion, and severe political strife inthe WAEMU region. The relative fragility&#13;
o f the external balance also emphasizes the need to promote private sector development,&#13;
especially export-oriented activities. At this stage, the Senegalese export sector lacks&#13;
dynamism, as it needs to diversify beyond traditional resources such as vegetable oil and&#13;
phosphoric acid.5&#13;
&#13;
9.         With monetary and exchange rate policies determined at the regional level,&#13;
fiscal policy will remain the main instrument o f macroeconomic policy in Senegal,&#13;
supported by structural reforms. Over the recent years, fiscal policy has been conducted&#13;
in a prudent manner, leading to low primary deficits.                    This fiscal stance has been&#13;
buttressed by the cautious monetary policy of the BCEAO, which is aimed at&#13;
underpinningthe exchange rate anchor, and delivering low inflation. The authorities&#13;
have rightly put increasing attention on the needto improvethe allocative and operational&#13;
efficiencies o f public spending as a way to maximize the impact of their fiscal policy on&#13;
growth and equity. On the structural front, reforms have been implemented in the&#13;
groundnut and electricity sectors, sometimes with delays and occasional backtracking on&#13;
initial plans, hindering the realization o f the country's growth potential and its poverty&#13;
reduction goals. Nevertheless, the Government has privatized many public enterprises,&#13;
enhanced the environment for private sector activities, and made some improvements in&#13;
the country's infrastructure. Looking forward, the authorities should continue prudent&#13;
fiscal policies, and give priority to addressing the structural bottlenecks in order to&#13;
enhance the efficiency o f the economy, particularly inthe export sector.&#13;
&#13;
10.        Senegal has exited from the enhanced HIPC Initiative with a good basis for&#13;
maintaining sustainable external debt levels over the medium term, especially if&#13;
borrowing remains at concessional terms. This positive assessment has been reinforced&#13;
by its recent qualification to the Multilateral Debt-Reduction Initiative (MDRI),&#13;
equivalent to a savings o f about US$60 million indebt-service per year. The preliminary&#13;
result of the Debt-Sustainability Analysis (DSA) conducted by the IMF and the Bank&#13;
&#13;
5 A clear indication of the concentration of Senegal's exports is that in2002, the top five exports at the 8-&#13;
digit Harmonized System levelrepresented over 40 percent oftotal exports (petroleum, crude vegetable oil,&#13;
phosphoric acid, lobster and shrimps).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                 - 6 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
reveals that the level o f public external debt will be as low as 11 percent o f GDP at the&#13;
end of 2006.6 This unprecedented low ratio indicates that Senegal's public debt should&#13;
be sustainable over the medium term, even in the case o f negative shocks, such as a&#13;
decline ineconomic growth and/or deterioration inthe terms o f trade.&#13;

         IV. PROGRESSINIMPLEMENTING THE REFORMPROGRAM&#13;
&#13;
Overview&#13;
11.        The Private Sector Adjustment Credit (PSAC) is an integral part of the Bank&#13;
strategy set forth in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Senegal presented to the&#13;
Board on April 17,2003, as well as innew CAS currently under preparationwith Board&#13;
submission scheduled for later in FY07. The objective o f the Credit is to support the&#13;
Government in the implementation of sector reforms aimed at improving the investment&#13;
climate and accelerating private sector growth and employment. The PSAC supports the&#13;
government's Poverty Reduction Strategy through improving the investment climate and&#13;
implementing key sector reforms by: (i)        restructuring the edible oil sector by improving&#13;
the competitive environment in which it operates, through elimination or reduction o f&#13;
policy distortions associated with non-tariff barriers and other domestic protection&#13;
mechanisms, and o f public interventions; (ii)       supporting the implementation o f a private&#13;
enterprise tax regime that stimulates investmentsthrough a level playing field and lower&#13;
taxes, and allocates user fees more effectively for private sector purposes; (iii)          reforming&#13;
postal services by introducing greater competition into the sector, restructuringthe postal&#13;
enterprise so as to enhance its sustainability and to create an autonomous financial&#13;
subsidiary that would provide savings and payment and transfer services; and (iv)&#13;
bringingchanges to the pensions system to make it financially sustainable and improve&#13;
its corporate governance.&#13;
&#13;
12.        To date, an edible oil tranche release was made on January 28, 2005 following&#13;
project effectiveness which was confirmed on January 12, 2005. This was followed by a&#13;
first floating fiscal tranche release that was released on September 27, 2005. Interms o f&#13;
the two outstanding tranche releases - for the postal and pensions sectors - after a period&#13;
of delay, there has been considerable progress since the November 2005 IDA supervision&#13;
mission when the IDA team formally confirmed that the project would not deliver on its&#13;
outstanding project commitments before the December 2005 project closing date.&#13;
Following consultation with the key reform stakeholders responsible for the two&#13;
outstanding tranche conditions, the Government made a request for a project extension&#13;
which, as per IDA advice, was supported with a detailed implementation plan. On this&#13;
basis, IDA approved a 14-month first extension until February 28, 2007.The IDA&#13;
supervision mission o f February 2005 reviewed and determined that there had been&#13;
successful progress to date against actions and milestones set out inthe implementation&#13;
plan-inparticular inrespect of the postal reform.&#13;
&#13;
13.        While there has beennotable progress over the past ten months inrespect o f the&#13;
outstanding tranche conditions pertainingto the postal and the pensions sectors, there has&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
also been the need to address some recent policy actions taken by the Government that&#13;
impact the PSAC-related reforms undertaken to date inthe edible oil sector. This matter&#13;
i s dealt with more fully inthe following section.&#13;
&#13;
Edible OilSector Reform&#13;
&#13;
14.       About 30 percent o f the Senegalesepopulation directly or indirectly derives part&#13;
of its livelihood from the groundnut sector. The overall liberalization efforts pursued by&#13;
the Government inthe 1990s, and more recently in2001 with the divestiture o f the seeds&#13;
distribution subsidiary o f the monopolistic groundnut processing public enterprise&#13;
(SONACOS), have encouraged some efficiency gains. A major further step was taken&#13;
with the completionofthe SONACOS privatizationprocess inApril 2005.&#13;
&#13;
15.       A sector reform strategy, outlined inthe government's Edible Oil Sector Policy&#13;
Letter calls for the following broad actions to be taken: (i) elimination of trade policy,&#13;
and other regulatory and financial sector distortions; (ii)divestiture of SONACOS; (iii)&#13;
complementary sector reforms, involving diversification o f production in groundnut&#13;
producing areas, as well as possible downstream measuresto meet untapped demand; and&#13;
(iv) clearance of accumulated liabilities, estimated at under CFAF 10 billion, through a&#13;
one-time financial restructuring o f the sector.&#13;
&#13;
16.       The PSAC focuses on eliminating the most serious trade policy and domestic&#13;
distortions.   These eliminations are seen as key to the effective development and&#13;
diversification of the sector. The following condition o f effectiveness was substantially&#13;
met in December 2004, after three extensions, when the President signed the law&#13;
eliminating the taxes that provided protection to SONACOS:             "the Borrower has&#13;
implemented the agreed action plan for the edible oil sector reform regarding the&#13;
elimination or reduction, as the case may be, of the economic distortions in the areas of&#13;
trade, domestic market andfinancial sector policy, inter alia, through the elimination of&#13;
the TCIand Taxe Spe`cifiqueon edible oils."&#13;
&#13;
 17.       The Government first        suspended the application of the TCI (Taxe&#13;
Conjoncturelle d'Importation) benefit to the edible oils through administrative action&#13;
carried out at the level o f the Director General of Customs.        This action was then&#13;
complemented by the passage, on December 14, 2004 of law No. 2004-34, which&#13;
involvedthe abrogation andreplacement of article 360 ofthe General Import Code with a&#13;
revision that eliminates the protective tax (Taxe Spe`czfique) imposed on both processed&#13;
and unprocessed edible oils. This law was scheduled to go into effect on December 31,&#13;
2005, the original closing date o f the PSAC. Due to an upsurge o f palm oil imports in&#13;
2004 and 2005, the Government additionally sought further protection to the domestic&#13;
edible oil industry and passed, on December 16, 2005, a new protective law that extends&#13;
protection against all importededible oils, regardless of their origin. This law, however,&#13;
didnot comply with WAEMU rules and WTO provisionsregarding safeguards measures;&#13;
and it constituted, in the Bank's view, a potential reversal o f policy commitments made&#13;
under the PSAC. Following extensive consultations between the Bank and the&#13;
Government and based on in-depth analysis on international and regional trade&#13;
regulations, the Government passed a corrective legislation on July 13, 2006 providing&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                            - 8 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
for a transitory protection which conforms with WTO and WAEMU rules. This i s&#13;
accepted as consistent with the terms of reform agreedto under the PSAC.&#13;
&#13;
Tax Reform&#13;
&#13;
18.       The government's decision to proceed with a tax reform initiative arose out o f&#13;
in-depth diagnostic work undertaken in collaboration with FIAS. Investment in Senegal&#13;
was being deterred by excessively high tax rates, further complicated by a multitude o f&#13;
taxes, user fees and heavy administrative arrangements. The system was recognized to&#13;
lack transparency and encourage rent-seeking.&#13;
&#13;
19.       The tax reform process commenced with the prior Trade Reform and&#13;
Competitiveness Credit (Cr. 3419) which assisted in the implementation o f reforms&#13;
covering VAT, tariffs and business taxation. The PSAC extends this reform drive further&#13;
with a program to reduce a number of taxes, including the Marginal Effective Tax rate&#13;
(METR) which decreased from 45 percent to 28 percent. Additionally, the reform&#13;
package harmonizes the vocational training tax treatment o f national and foreign workers&#13;
and allocates 30 percent ofproceeds, which the Ministry ofthe Economy and Finance has&#13;
confirmed amounts to US$1 million for 2006, to a matching grant facility in operation&#13;
under the Private Investment Promotion Project (Cr. 3767). Discussions are under way&#13;
between the Ministry of the Economy and Finance and the private sector to agree on the&#13;
modalities for the deployment of this allocationto the matching grant facility.&#13;
&#13;
20.       The reform also includes the rationalization of investmentcode waivers granted&#13;
in regard to the consumption tax and import duties to bring these in line with the&#13;
WAEMU Common External Tariff and the Value-Added Tax Scheme. This tax reform&#13;
programhas been widely supported by the Government as well as the private sector, with&#13;
a further METR reduction to 25 percent, which goes beyond even the original objective&#13;
of the PSAC tax reform activities.&#13;
&#13;
Postal ServicesReform&#13;
&#13;
21.       The postal sector reform inthe PSAC is based on the Government o f Senegal's&#13;
Letter o f Postal Sector Policy o f April 17, 2003, which includes actions to: (i)improve&#13;
overall performance through a progressive sector liberalization and increased private&#13;
sector participation; (ii)modernize the legal and regulatory framework and strengthen&#13;
sector regulation; (iii)&#13;
                       safeguard the right to basic communications for all citizens through&#13;
a funding mechanism to support the cost o f universal postal services obligations; (iv)&#13;
transform the historicalpostal operator into a modem and performing corporation through&#13;
the definition and implementation of a new corporate strategy; and (v) promote the&#13;
sustainable development o f postal financial services in order to improve access o f the&#13;
population to basic financial and savings services, and channel these savings towards&#13;
private investment funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22.       The PSAC supports (i)   ongoing reforms aimed at introducing more competition&#13;
in postal services, strengthening corporate governance, and restructuring the postal&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                - 9 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
corporation so as to improve its sustainability and its service quality; and (ii)&#13;
implementation o f the required financial restructuring o f the operator. The policy and&#13;
institutional reform actions set out in the PSAC postal tranche release conditions are&#13;
further supported by a complementary capacity building and capital investment program&#13;
financed out of the Private Investment Promotioninvestment credit (PIPP).&#13;
&#13;
23.         After an initial period o f satisfactory progress, the postal services reform was&#13;
slowed considerably in late 2004 for about eight months, mainly due to the change o f&#13;
managing director and the lack of sustained support from Government. However, since&#13;
September 2005, La Poste and its stakeholders have proceeded purposefully and&#13;
effectively with the PSAC elements o fthe overall sector reform agenda.&#13;
&#13;
24.         The PSAC conditionalities were initially designed to ensure long-term&#13;
sustainability o f the reform impact interms of increased contribution o f the postal system&#13;
to the national economy. A new legal and regulatory framework i s now inplace, and La&#13;
Poste yielded a small net result in 2005, for the first time in more than a decade.&#13;
However, human resources management, including personnel status and indebtedness,&#13;
remains an issue that needs to be addressed by the Board o f Managers together with the&#13;
recommendations o f the Task Force that was set up earlier this year with the intention to&#13;
make proposals to the Board of Managers by August 2006.&#13;
&#13;
25.         While financial sustainability of the Socie`te` Nationale de La Poste (SNP) has&#13;
significantly improved over the last three years, the balance remains fragile. SNP i s not&#13;
profitable enough to self-fund capacity investments. Without those investments, it will be&#13;
difficult to implement the new development objectives in terms o f information and&#13;
communication technology. Yet, investment in Information Communication Technology&#13;
(ICT) and interconnection of the post offices are an absolute prerequisite for a postal&#13;
operator to move into the e-economy. SNP's shareholder will need to continue supporting&#13;
the company on a fair andtransparent level.&#13;
&#13;
Pension Reform&#13;
&#13;
26.         World Bank engagement inpensions inSenegal dates back to 1999. By 2001, a&#13;
comprehensive report on the various pension schemes was producedby a team o f experts&#13;
working closely with the Government o f Senegal.7 Through its analysis of the Fonds&#13;
National de Retraite (FNR) scheme, the report contributed to the parametric reform that&#13;
was implementedin early 2002. The government's pensionreform strategy i s described&#13;
in the sector policy statement dated June 6, 2003. This was followed by the pension&#13;
component o f the PSAC, wherein the Government committed to undertake a number o f&#13;
policy measures with a view towards incremental pension reform. The implementation&#13;
o f these policy changes requires a series o f concrete steps including improvements to the&#13;
governance systems; management and fiduciary controls o f key pension schemes,&#13;
including changes to existing information systems; professional advice regarding&#13;
investment policy; and, fiscal actions to address sustainability issues facing some of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   "Building a secure, sustainable and modern pension system in Senegal" (2001). The report was also&#13;
translated to French.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                             - 10-&#13;
&#13;
schemes. The implementation requirements o f this reform effort are being supported&#13;
under the pension sub-component ofthe PIPP.&#13;
&#13;
27.       To date, two o f the five measures required to satisfy tranche release&#13;
conditionality have been met. These include: (i)      creation o f the Conseil de Supervision&#13;
et Re'gulation des Institutions de Se'curite'Sociale (COSRISS) and (ii)  clearance o f arrears&#13;
between the Government and I' Institution de Pre'voyance Retraite du Se'ne'gal (IPRES).&#13;
Further to the June 2006 supervision mission, the Government and IDA have agreed on&#13;
the specific steps required to satisfy the three remaining conditions concerning private&#13;
pensions, the IPRES investment policy and the actions to be taken on the question o f&#13;
integrating IPRES and FNR. Based on milestones established in consultation with the&#13;
technical team andthe Minister o f Labor, who ledthe government's team duringthe June&#13;
2006 mission, release conditions for the final pensionfloating tranche will have been met&#13;
by the end of October 2006. What will be key to successful outcomes inregard to these&#13;
remainingtranche condition milestones will be the proactive leadership of the Minister o f&#13;
Labor to steer this stage of the reform effort through to its conclusion.&#13;
&#13;
            V. PROGRESS AGAINST TRANCHE RELEASE CRITERIA&#13;
&#13;
28.       The government has maintained a satisfactory niacroeconomic framework, as&#13;
agreed with the Bank and the IMF. This has been confirmed by the recent Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy (CAS) preparation as described in section 111. Further, the Bank i s&#13;
satisfied with the progress achieved and maintained by the program. The first tranche&#13;
was disbursedupon effectiveness on January 12, 2005. The conditions o f release o f the&#13;
floating tranche related to the Tax Reform Plan were met and this tranche was released&#13;
September 27,2005.&#13;
&#13;
29.       The conditions ofrelease ofthe floating tranche listedinPart B of Schedule 2 of&#13;
the Development Credit Agreement betweenthe Borrower and IDA related to the Postal&#13;
Services Reform state that the following conditions mustbe fulfilled:&#13;
&#13;
1.    The effective transfer of responsibility for the regulation of postal services from&#13;
      SNP (Socie'te' nationale de La poste) to ART (Agence de rigulation des&#13;
      telecommunications) - This condition has been met.&#13;
&#13;
Two laws (No. 2006-01 on postal sector; No. 2006-02 modifying the 2001&#13;
telecommunication sector law) were passed and endorsed in early January 2006. In&#13;
addition to opening the sector to competition on the letter segment up to 500g, with a&#13;
view to progressively lowering this threshold towards international standards (50g and&#13;
below), this new legal framework entrusts the postal regulation to Autorite' de Regulation&#13;
des Telecommunications (ART), transformed into Autorite' de Regulation. des&#13;
Telecommunications et des Postes (ARTP). There i s ongoing technical assistance with&#13;
ARTP aimed at supporting the new regulator to get started, notably concerning the postal&#13;
universal service obligations and funding mechanisms, and the licensing and&#13;
liberalization processes.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                            - 11-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.      Performance-based agreement entered into between the Borrower and SNP for&#13;
        the operation ofpostal services - This conditionhas beenmet.&#13;
&#13;
The 2005-2007 performance-based agreement was signed between the Borrower and&#13;
SNP on November 16, 2005, with retroactive effectiveness as o f January 2005. Annexes&#13;
o f the agreement provide with performance indicators for operational, management and&#13;
financial performance. Stakeholders have started to assess the first year implementation&#13;
o f the agreement, with a view to preparing a thorough monitoring report at its mid-term,&#13;
expected to be transmitted to IDA by the end September 2006. This agreement provides&#13;
the platform for an improved performance-based monitoring o f the State-owned company&#13;
that will allow the enterprise and its shareholder to look at the cost structure and financial&#13;
performance from a strict corporate angle.&#13;
&#13;
3.      A subsidiary of SNP is created and is in charge of postal financial services&#13;
        previously managed by SNP - This conditionhasbeenmet.&#13;
&#13;
The creation of the postal financial subsidiary (PosteFinances)was effective on February&#13;
20, 2006 when the statutes of the company were signed by the shareholders (SNP,&#13;
Mutuelle d`kpargne et de cridit des agents du secteur public et parapublic (MECAP),&#13;
personnel), completing an institutional process that consisted inter alia o f the decision o f&#13;
SNP's Board of Directors (December 2005) to create the subsidiary fully owned by the&#13;
Government of the postal savings books (Caisse nationale d'epargne) and the compte-&#13;
cheques postaux (CCP). SNP provided for FCFA 250 million o f initial capital by end&#13;
March 2006. An increase to FCFA 1 billion i s scheduled by the end o f 2006, to meet&#13;
Commission bancaire de 1`Afrique centrale (COBAC) recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
This scheme reflects the compromise reached in the summer of 2005 after a Financial&#13;
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) report, prepared by the International Monetary Fund&#13;
and the World Bank's financial sector department, ruledthat the postal financial services&#13;
subsidiary should in a first period strengthen its current operations before harnessing&#13;
private sector participation and moving into lending operations. Inthis respect, an ad hoc&#13;
specific prudential regime i s also under definition for PosteFinances,which will apply as&#13;
long as the firm i s not formally under the Central Bank's regulation.&#13;
&#13;
Duringthis coming transitional period until the new subsidiary can become independent&#13;
o f the mother company for working capital and cash flow. a number o f measures are&#13;
being taken: (i)new convention for clearing o f the "comptes-chequespostaux" (CCP)&#13;
                 a&#13;
with the Treasury is being drafted and should be finalized by September 2006; (ii)         an&#13;
accounting scheme i s being introduced to track         all cashflows as well as financial&#13;
transfers provided byLa Poste.The subsidiary i s to refundits mother company as soon as&#13;
its working capital and cash flows are stabilized; (iii) transitional organizational chart&#13;
                                                          a&#13;
was established and its personnel assigned early in February. In coordination with the&#13;
unions, a new personnel status, based on national bank branch models, is being drafted&#13;
for the subsidiary employees. The 190 staff currently assigned to PosteFinances will&#13;
have until December 2006 to decide whether they want to remain with the subsidiary&#13;
(under a new status) or returnto the mother company.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                           - 12-&#13;
&#13;
                                   V. CONCLUSION&#13;
&#13;
30.      In view of the overall progress with the implementation of the Postal Sector&#13;
Reform Program supported by the Credit and in compliance with the specific conditions&#13;
of release described in Section IV, para 19 items 1-3, the Association has informed the&#13;
Borrower of the availability of the Postal Services Reform floating tranche inthe amount&#13;
of SDR 6 million.&#13;

            Project : release of the second floating tranche - full compliance
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Government of Senegal has maintained
            a satisfactory macroeconomic framework, as agreed with the
            Bank and the IMF. This has been confirmed by the recent
            Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) preparation. Further, the
            Bank is satisfied with the progress achieved and maintained
            by the program. The first tranche was disbursed upon
            effectiveness on January 12, 2005. The conditions of release
            of the floating tranche related to the Tax Reform Plan were
            met and this tranche was released September 27, 2005. In
            view o f the overall progress with the implementation of the
            Postal Sector Reform Program supported by the Credit and in
            compliance with the specific conditions of release described
            in Section IV, para 19 items 1-3, the Association has
