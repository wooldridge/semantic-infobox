This report was based on the findings of preparation missions which visited Jamaica in January&#13;
and May 1995 led by Mr. Emesto Cuadra (LA3HR). A pre-appraisal mission in December 1995&#13;
and an appraisal mission in March 1996 were led by Ms. Jill Armstrong (Economist), LA3HR.&#13;
The appraisal mission included: Patrick Noonan (Financial Specialist, consultant); Reynaldo&#13;
Pastor (Lawyer, LEGLA); and William Gallagher (Systems Specialist, consultant). Errol&#13;
Graham, Patricia Shako-Daly and Sarah Adam from the Jamaican Resident Mission all made&#13;
significant contributions during project preparation. Margaret Grosh (Senior Economist,&#13;
PHRHD) reviewed targeting criteria; James Hanna and Cesar Fort (LA3PS) helped develop the&#13;
institutional framework and the sensitivity analyses; Aracelly Woodall (LA3HR) developed the&#13;
project costing module. Peer reviews were submitted by Nancy Mcinemey-Lacombe (AF2PE)&#13;
and Jamil Salmi (LA2HR). The project was prepared under the direction of Julian Schweitzer&#13;
(Chief, LA3HR) and Paul Isenman (Director, LA3).&#13;

LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:          Government of Jamaica&#13;
Beneficiaries and&#13;
Executing Agencies: Ministry of Finance and Students' Loan Bureau&#13;
Loan Amount:       US$ 28.5 million&#13;
Terms:             Seventeen years including a five year grace period at the standard interest&#13;
rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans.&#13;
Commitment Fee:  0.75 percent on undisbursed loan balances beginning 60 days after&#13;
signing, less any waiver.&#13;
Relending terms:   US$ 27.0 million of the Bank loan would be provided by the Borrower to&#13;
the Students' Loan Bureau (SLB). The SLB would relend the loan&#13;
proceeds to approved financial institutions (AFIs). The AFIs, in turn, will&#13;
onlend the proceeds of the loan to eligible students to finance their tuition&#13;
fees on similar terms and conditions as those between the SLB and the&#13;
AFIs. During the period students are in school and for a grace period of&#13;
6 months after leaving school, 15% fixed interest rate would be charged&#13;
annually and capitalized. During the repayment period, the average&#13;
passbook savings rate for deposits in Jamaican Dollars paid by&#13;
commercial banks in Jamaica plus 5 percentage points would be charged&#13;
and adjusted annually on January 1 st. The maturity of the loans would be&#13;
a maximum of 7 years, but could be shorter if mutually agreed by students&#13;
and AFIs. AFIs would receive a margin of 3.5% to cover administrative&#13;
costs.&#13;
Financing Plan:    See para. 3.6.&#13;

STUDENT LOAN PROJECT&#13;
1. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND STRATEGIES&#13;
MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT&#13;
1.1   Jamaica is the largest English-speaking Caribbean country. Its population of 2.5 million (1993)&#13;
is growing at 0.86% per year and is roughly divided between urban and rural areas. In 1994, per capita&#13;
GNP was US$1,420. Jamaica is well-endowed with natural resources and possesses a well-developed&#13;
financial system. The economy is highly sensitive to international price and demand changes, and is&#13;
entirely dependent on imported oil for commercial energy consumption. The principal economic&#13;
activities are tourism, bauxite/alumina mining and processing, manufacturing, and, in terms of&#13;
employment, agriculture. Together, these sectors account for over half of the country's GDP and&#13;
employment, and over three-quarters of its foreign exchange earnings.&#13;
1.2  In the 1970s and 1980s, Jamaica went through a long period of economic decline and stagnation&#13;
coupled with macroeconomic instability and structural disequilibrium. At the end of the period, per&#13;
capita GDP declined by about 20% in real terms, inflation was running at more than 20% per annum,&#13;
the public sector was overextended, and the accumulated external debt was claiming over half of public&#13;
expenditures. In order to break this cycle, the Government that came into office in 1989 adopted a&#13;
reform program consisting of macroeconomic stabilization, structural adjustment, privatization and&#13;
rationalization of the public sector. An important feature of the adjustment process was to restore the&#13;
flow of funds to the social sectors, to reduce poverty and promote human capital development. Despite&#13;
strong reform efforts from mid-1993 and until mid-1995, growth in the 1990s has been slow (at about&#13;
1% p.a.) and there remain deep structural problems (notably the financial and public sectors and the&#13;
labor market, plus crime and violence). Growth has been uneven across sectors, with the continuing&#13;
decline in the manufacturing sector dominating minimal growth in others. Since mid-1995, the Jamaican&#13;
dollar has depreciated against the US dollar, and public sector surpluses have fallen, partly in response&#13;
to attempts to maintain the Jamaican dollar and sharply rising government wage settlements. Inflation&#13;
has shown signs of accelerating from a monthly average of 1% during the first six months of 1995 to&#13;
almost 3% per month during the period September to November, and 4.3% in December 1995, giving&#13;
an annualized rate in 1995 of 22%, nearly double government's target. Projected real GDP growth for&#13;
1995 is marginally positive. The Government's strategy is to continue with short-term macro&#13;
stabilization policies, while simultaneously enhancing growth prospects through rebalancing&#13;
public/private sectors, and reducing pervasive poverty.&#13;
OVERVIEW OF THE EDUCATION SECTOR&#13;
1.3   Because of the importance of education for sustained economic growth and poverty reduction,&#13;
the Government of Jamaica (GOJ) has assumed the role of principal provider and funder of education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
Declining government resources, however, have resulted in insufficient funds to ensure the standard of&#13;
education to which the government is committed to providing. Although extensive in its coverage,&#13;
Jamaica's education system is characterized by poor quality, significant inefficiencies and inequity in the&#13;
provision of resources and opportunities, particularly across socio-economic groups. Too many&#13;
students are leaving the formal education system with limited earning potential and without&#13;
qualifications necessary to fill the country's labor demands.&#13;
1.4   The Ministry of Education, Youth and Culture (MOEYC) manages and operates almost 1,400&#13;
public primary, secondary, vocational and tertiary institutions employing 20,000 teachers and serving&#13;
nearly 700,000 students. Primary school education is compulsory and coverage is nearly universal with&#13;
a 98% net enrollment rate. The ratio of girls to boys is even, and access across consumption groups is&#13;
relatively equal. However, quality varies greatly among primary and all-age schools as reflected by&#13;
differentials in repetition and examination pass rates. The high primary enrollment figures also mask&#13;
average daily attendance rates of 70% with the result that only 70% of students are functionally literate&#13;
at the end of Grade 6. Reforms are underway at the primary level to improve curriculum, provide other&#13;
inputs and revise the assessment system. At the secondary level, average enrollment drops sharply from&#13;
85% in Grades 7-9 to 45% in Grades 10-11. Secondary level education is provided in a stratified and&#13;
inequitable system characterized by wide disparities in the type and quality of programs offered.&#13;
Schools serving children from relatively wealthy families receive more and better quality inputs.&#13;
Presently, the government is undertaking a Reform of Secondary Education (ROSE) Program which&#13;
aims to improve the quality and equity of lower secondary education (grades 7-9), especially for those&#13;
from lower income groups.&#13;
1.5   Tertiary Education. Public tertiary education is offered by a diverse set of institutions&#13;
including the Mona Campus of the regional University of the West Indies (UWI), the University of&#13;
Technology (UTech--until November 1995 known as the College of Arts, Science and Technology),&#13;
eight teachers' colleges, six multi-disciplinary colleges, the College of Agriculture, Science and&#13;
Education, the Edna Manley College, and several small institutions. Total enrollment at higher&#13;
institutions increased from 18,370 in 1988/89 to almost 25,000 in 1992/93, representing approximately&#13;
9.5% of the relevant age cohort. Enrollment rates at the tertiary level are above the regional average of&#13;
7.8%, but below the average for middle-income countries (14%).&#13;
1.6   Access to higher education is constrained by two factors. First, the number of places is&#13;
insufficient. For example, UWI's social science faculty received 2,250 applications in 1994 for less than&#13;
500 places. The medical science faculty admitted 110 students out of 450 Jamaican applicants. The&#13;
number of qualified students wishing to pursue tertiary education can be expected to increase more&#13;
rapidly as a result of ROSE. The first cohort to receive the new secondary curriculum could enter&#13;
tertiary programs in about three years. Moreover, the Government has indicated that tertiary level&#13;
output needs to double in order to create and sustain an economic turnaround.&#13;
1.7   The second factor constraining access to tertiary education is the high private cost of tertiary&#13;
education (i.e. tuition, other fees, maintenance and books). Coupled with the fact that there are limited&#13;
financing mechanisms, these costs serve to restrict enrollment, particularly among students from low-&#13;
income families and rural areas.&#13;
1.8   UVWI. The University of the West Indies--a regional institution serving 14 Caribbean countries--&#13;
offers certificate, degree, diploma and postgraduate programs in the faculties of Agriculture, Arts and&#13;
General Studies, Education, Engineering, Law, Medical Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Social&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
Sciences. There are campuses in Jamaica, Trinidad and Barbados. Ninety percent of all students at the&#13;
Mona Campus in Kingston are Jamaicans. In 1992/93, there were approximately 6,300 Jamaican&#13;
students enrolled in first degree, higher degree, certificate and diploma programs (Annex I, Table 1).&#13;
Female enrollment is about 62% of the total. Since its inception, UWI has awarded approximately&#13;
18,000 first degrees, 3,300 certificates, 2,500 diplomas and 270 advanced diplomas to Jamaicans.&#13;
Jamaican undergraduates are heavily concentrated in social sciences, natural sciences and liberal arts,&#13;
while most advanced degrees are in social sciences, natural sciences and medicine. Social sciences,&#13;
especially public administration and management studies, dominate enrollments in certificate and&#13;
diploma programs.&#13;
1.9   The University of Technology (UTech) offers degree, professional, diploma and certificate&#13;
courses in eight departments: architecture, building, commerce, computing, engineering, institutional&#13;
management, science, and technical teacher training. The School of Architecture offers a masters level&#13;
program. In 1993/94, there were nearly 6,000 students enrolled in full and part-time programs at&#13;
UTech (Annex I, Table 2). The Commerce Department enrolls 35% of students followed by&#13;
Engineering (19%). Total enrollments of men and women are almost equal; however, 95% of the&#13;
engineering students are male while 70% of the commerce students are female. Enrollment during the&#13;
1980s exceeded projections. This was primarily the result of the growth in part-time and modular&#13;
programs which currently enroll about 56% of all students. The enrollment rate has slowed since&#13;
1990/91 as a result of financial and related capacity constraints rather than a decrease in the number of&#13;
qualified applicants.&#13;
1.10  Teachers' Colleges. There are eight teachers' colleges with a total enrollment of 3,500 in&#13;
1992/93. Approximately 10% of enrollment was in the Post-Certificate program under which practicing&#13;
teachers are upgraded to the Diploma level. Enrollment in teachers' colleges increased 28% between&#13;
1988/89 and 1990/91, but has slowed to a modest 4% to 5% since then. The number of places at&#13;
teachers' colleges is determined by the projected need of the teaching service and the Ministry of&#13;
Education's budget.&#13;
1.11  Multi-disciplinary Colleges. In 1992/93, five multi-disciplinary colleges enrolled&#13;
approximately 7,300 students in A-level and pre-university programs, professional, commercial and&#13;
vocational and community-oriented courses. Approximately 46% of enrollment is by part- time&#13;
students. Women account for 63% of full-time enrollments.&#13;
EDUCATION FINANCING&#13;
1.12 Reflecting the priority that the Government places on education, the MOEYC commands the&#13;
largest share of total government non-debt expenditure--14.4% in 1995/96. However, Jamaica's&#13;
increasing debt burden has adversely affected efforts to increase education's share of government&#13;
expenditure and inflation has eroded the value of education expenditures. In real terms, GOJ&#13;
expenditures on education in 1994/95 will barely exceed 1982/83 expenditures. Tight fiscal conditions&#13;
have resulted in declining and insufficient funds to ensure quality across all levels of the education&#13;
system. As a share of public expenditures, education has fallen from just over 13% in 1989/90 to 8.5%&#13;
in 1995/96. And, as a share of GDP, education spending has fallen from 7% in 1981 to an estimated&#13;
4.7% in 1994/95. Within education, the government's stated priority is basic education (Grades 1-9).&#13;
In terms of the allocation of resources within education, 33% of recurrent spending in 1995/96 was&#13;
allocated to preprimary and primary programs, 29% to secondary, and 28% to tertiary. However, over&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
the last three years, the share of tertiary has risen from 20% in 1993/94 to 28% in 1995/96. In per&#13;
student terms, in 1993/94 the GOJ spent J$2,177 for primary, and $4,325 for secondary students; for&#13;
tertiary students the expenditure was J$34,472 --fifteen times that of primary and almost eight times&#13;
secondary level per capita expenditures.&#13;
1.13  Even though tertiary institutions enjoy high administrative autonomy, they rely heavily on&#13;
government funding. In particular, the GOJ provides more than two-thirds of UWI's operating&#13;
expenses. However, the government has little ability to contain costs or impose fiscal discipline at UWI&#13;
because of the institution's regional nature; Jamaica is only one of 14 Caribbean countries represented&#13;
on the governing council. The GOJ has now taken a policy stance that it is no longer prepared to&#13;
finance UWI's overdrafts.' The Government also funds about 50% of UTech's budget, 84% of the&#13;
teachers' colleges expenses and two-thirds of the recurrent costs of multi-disciplinary colleges. Tuition&#13;
fees, fund-raising and research grants make up the rest of their operating budgets.&#13;
1.14  Although the public sector finances the bulk of expenditures for education, a significant source is&#13;
from students and parents. Until recently, this has been in the form of informal cost sharing at&#13;
secondary level and more formal cost recovery from students attending tertiary institutions. In the past,&#13;
inflows from these sources accounted for less than 5% of the MOEYC's recurrent budget. Due to tight&#13;
fiscal conditions and recognizing the need for mobilizing additional resources to raise the quality of&#13;
education, the MOEYC implemented a formal cost-sharing program at the secondary level in 1993/94.&#13;
Secondary schools are required to set and collect fees to cover non-salary recurrent expenditures;&#13;
government continues to pay school-level salaries.&#13;
1.15  At the tertiary level, the governmental university levy (the "Cess"), which was introduced in&#13;
1986 and set at approximately 7.3% of economic costs, was abolished in 1993/94. It was replaced by&#13;
fees collected directly by the institutions based on guidelines that fees cover approximately 15% of&#13;
economic costs. In subsequent years, however, economic costs were not adjusted for price and wage&#13;
increases, resulting in declining value of fees as a proportion of total economic costs (currently they are&#13;
about 10.7%). Beginning in 1996/97, further reductions in funding levels to tertiary institutions are&#13;
planned given additional expected fee increases. For UWI, proposed fees will cover 15% of economic&#13;
costs in 1996/97 for new students--equivalent to a doubling of current fees--and rising to 20% by&#13;
1997/98. Returning students will pay an increase in fees equivalent to 10.7% of economic costs.&#13;
PRIVATE COSTS AND FINANCING OF TERTIARY EDUCATION&#13;
1.16  Private costs of tertiary education include tuition, fees, books and maintenance (Annex I, Table&#13;
3). Students draw on a combination of private financing (family, relatives and personal savings),&#13;
student loans, scholarships and bursaries to meet the private costs of tertiary education. Approximately&#13;
75% of students attending the University and UTech seek some form of assistance to help meet a share&#13;
of tuition and other expenses. The two existing student loan schemes meet only a portion of the&#13;
expenses facing tertiary students: the government's Student Loan Bureau (SLB) scheme covers less&#13;
1 In 1994, the GOJ assumed responsibility on an exceptional basis for outstanding overdrafts and debts of the Mona&#13;
Campus and University Hospital of UWI for J$ 1,400 million (about US$42 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
than half the present level of tuition fees, and only about 10% of total student financing needs; when&#13;
combined with the Banker's Loan Scheme, students can finance up to 40% of their total requirements.&#13;
Existing Student Loan Schemes&#13;
1.17 The Student Loan Bureau Scheme. A revolving Loan Scheme administered by the Students'&#13;
Loan Bureau began operations in 1970. Under the 1971 Students' Loan Fund Act, the SLB became a&#13;
statutory body authorized to make loans to Jamaican nationals pursuing courses of higher education at&#13;
prescribed tertiary institutions in Jamaica and overseas. A Students' Loan Council establishes policy for&#13;
the SLB.&#13;
1.18  The SLB has approved approximately 53,000 loans since it was established. The average&#13;
number of loans processed annually increased from 1,000 in 1970 to over 3,100 in 1993 (Annex I, Table&#13;
4). During the same period, the average loan increased from J$1,600 to J$9,000. However, the real&#13;
value of a loan in 1993 was less than one-tenth the value of a loan granted in 1970. The maximum loan&#13;
available from the SLB presently covers only 45% of fees at UTech, 40% at UWI, 28% at the teachers&#13;
colleges and 17% at other institutions. The SLB conducts assessments of financial need that determine&#13;
whether the student qualifies for a loan on income grounds and the amount of the loan (the course of&#13;
study and related fees are also taken into account). In 1989, approval was granted to over 95% of&#13;
applicants (with over 90% receiving the maximum), suggesting either some lack of rigor in evaluating&#13;
applications, self-targeting or a generous family income ceiling (US$12,000 equivalent).&#13;
1.19  The Student Loan Fund was intended to operate as a revolving fund maintained by investments,&#13;
repayments of beneficiaries and government contributions. The Fund has remained heavily dependent&#13;
on injections from Government and externally funded projects, including two IDB projects (in 1971 for&#13;
US$8.0 million and in 1976 for US$8.5 million)2 and by the World Bank's Education Program&#13;
Preparation and Student Loan Project (1987, US$3.5 million). In 1993, less than a quarter of inflows3&#13;
were derived from the proceeds of loan collections (see Annex I, Table 5). Over half of the SLB's&#13;
operating budget came from income on investments (32%) plus Government injections and externally-&#13;
funded projects (more than a quarter).&#13;
1.20  Three factors have impacted negatively on the sustainability of the revolving fund scheme:&#13;
interest rate subsidies; default rates; and, administrative costs. The fixed interest rate of 12% per annum&#13;
results in high interest rate subsidies. In addition to the initial interest-free period (ranging from 1-4&#13;
years), prolonged periods of high inflation have meant that the real interest rate charged has been&#13;
negative. For example, the annual average rate of inflation during 1970-1983 was about 20%. Higher&#13;
inflation since 1990 has exacerbated this, despite the doubling of the interest rate on student loans after&#13;
1987. Second, although the SLB was able to reduce the default rate from about 40% of loan&#13;
disbursements in the late 1980s to 28% in more recent years by use of vigorous collection efforts,&#13;
2 In 1971, the loan fund of US$8.0 million consisted of the IDB financing of US$4.7 and US$3.3 million from the&#13;
Government of Jamaica. In 1976, the SLB received the replenishment of loan fund from the 1DB loan of US$5.3&#13;
million together with the Government's contribution of US$3.3.&#13;
3 Net of the "Cess" which the SLB collected until 1993/94 on behalf of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
default rates remain high.4 A third factor affecting the sustainability of the revolving scheme has been&#13;
the high share of administrative costs, which in 1994 accounted for just over 60% of loans disbursed&#13;
to students. The combination of these three factors has contributed to the decapitalization of the&#13;
revolving loan fund over time, necessitating fresh injections of government funds to continue the&#13;
program.&#13;
1.21   The high administrative costs and default rates can be partly attributable to the features of the&#13;
SLB. First, the SLB has a large number of staff (62 positions) given the annual number of new loans&#13;
processed (about 3,000) (Annex II, Chart A). Of the filled posts, five staff are on secondment from the&#13;
Bank of Jamaica. Although the staff complement is high, the SLB suffers from both vacancies of&#13;
critical staff and high staff turnover reflecting low salary levels.5 For example, the SLB has been unable&#13;
to attract a Systems Administrator or Financial Controller, arguably two of the most critical positions&#13;
given the functions of the SLB. The SLB has been also unable to retain an Internal Auditor. The lack&#13;
of these staff has resulted in the need to hire expensive consultants, usually billed on an hourly basis&#13;
(e.g. computer technicians, auditors). The staff the SLB is able to attract tend to be inexperienced (the&#13;
most glaring example is that the Data Processing Department is less than half staffed with non-computer&#13;
specialists running the system). A second major factor affecting the ability of the SLB to efficiently run&#13;
and monitor the Student Loan scheme is the weak financial information system. Recent reviews have&#13;
revealed that the computer system is not only obsolete, but is unable to handle the volume of work such&#13;
that loan accounts are maintained manually on green notecards. The system is unable to generate&#13;
accurate reports for such things as overdue accounts or loans in default; borrowers are also unable to be&#13;
told when the loan will be paid off or often, even it is has been.&#13;
1.22 The GOJ/Bankers' Association Student Loan Scheme. The maximum SLB loan covers only a&#13;
portion of fees and a fraction of the estimated total financing requirements of the student. In response&#13;
to the inability of the SLB scheme to meet the demand for student loans, a second student loan scheme&#13;
was launched in 1993 under the auspices of the Jamaican Bankers' Association (JBA) at the GOJ's&#13;
request; it is presently in its third year. The Bankers' Scheme consists of the following elements: (i) the&#13;
funding of loans through an Education Bond issued by the SLB and subscribed to initially by JBA&#13;
members and later other private companies; (ii) the management of the resulting trust fund by the West&#13;
Indies Trust Company (WITCO); (iii) loan processing by the SLB which determines eligibility and&#13;
recommends loans to banks; (iv) loan disbursement and collection by commercial banks; and (v) full&#13;
GOJ guarantee of principal and interest in the event of default (Annex II, Chart B).&#13;
1.23   The SLB issued an invitation for the GOJ-guaranteed Education Bond to the members of&#13;
Bankers' Association in an amount not to exceed J$100 million annually. The Bond carries a maturity&#13;
of 10 years, and a fixed interest rate of 15% for first three years and variable rate for the next seven&#13;
years (i.e. savings rate plus 5 percentage points). In addition to the guarantee against loan default, the&#13;
Government offered subscribing banks other incentives, including exemptions from incomes taxes on&#13;
interest income, transfer taxes and stamp duties.&#13;
4A recent Functional Review, (Nembhard &amp; Associates, 1995) indicated that due to the method of calculating arrears&#13;
(expected revenue ninus actual receipts) plus the antiquated state of the computer system, a portion of collections&#13;
reflect over- and pre-payment rather than arrears reduction.&#13;
The functional review found that most salaries were well below comparable levels in both public and private sectors,&#13;
even though the SLB is able to offer non-civil service salaries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
1.24 The SLB entered into a Trust Agreement establishing WITCO as trust fund manager. As part of&#13;
this function, WITCO pays a 1% annual commission on the outstanding loan portfolio to the&#13;
commercial banks to defray administrative costs. At this point, it is not clear whether actual&#13;
administrative costs are, or will be covered by this commission, especially when serious collection&#13;
efforts commence. The SLB will execute the full government loan guarantee on behalf of the GOJ by&#13;
reimbursing the principal and interest on loan accounts in default (i.e. in arrears for more than 6&#13;
months).&#13;
1.25  Students submit loan applications to the SLB, which processes them and makes loan&#13;
recommendations to the bank of students' choice for final approval.6 There is no means testing for the&#13;
Bankers Scheme and students may apply to both schemes. Banks then disburse the loans directly to the&#13;
tertiary institution which pays students the remaining balance after deducting tuition and fees. Finally,&#13;
banks request reimbursement from WITCO for the amount of loans paid out. In 1993/94, the second&#13;
scheme mobilized and disbursed J$81 million (US$3.1 million) to 3,291 students, with an average loan&#13;
size of J$24,650 (US$948). The amount disbursed under this scheme is almost four times that of the&#13;
SLB.&#13;
1.26  While enrolled, the interest rate is fixed at 15% (up to three years), and converts thereafter to a&#13;
variable rate (i.e. the prevailing savings rate plus 5 percentage point spread). Unlike the SLB loans,&#13;
interest begins to accrue upon loan disbursement and is capitalized. Loan repayment commences upon&#13;
graduation with no grace period or if a student leaves school. The interest rate subsidy (at about 2%&#13;
assuming an inflation rate for the life of the loan at 20%) is substantially less than in the case of the SLB&#13;
loan. Since the scheme has just begun to collect loan repayments, it is not possible to accurately&#13;
determine default rates. However, it is expected that because of the commercial nature of this scheme&#13;
and its more efficient loan collection infrastructure, the default rate would likely be lower than that of&#13;
the SLB. Commercial bankers have indicated that they expect the default rate to be similar to other&#13;
unsecured consumer credit, which hovers around 4% of the outstanding loan portfolio. However, the&#13;
full government guarantee of principal and interest might create negative incentives for due diligence in&#13;
loan collection. Firm estimates of the administrative costs of this scheme are unavailable, but at a&#13;
minimum they include a handling fee of 1% of loan portfolio that is reimbursed to the banks from the&#13;
Education Bond fund, as well as incremental costs incurred by the SLB for processing the loan&#13;
applications (equivalent to approximately 0.5% of loan disbursements). The long-term viability of this&#13;
scheme is a serious concern because it was created by a somewhat ad hoc arrangement and&#13;
understanding (based largely on goodwill) between the Government and the Bankers' Association.&#13;
Existing Scholarship and Grant Programs&#13;
1.27  UWI and UTech administer scholarships, bursaries, grants and loans to assist students with&#13;
educational costs. Funding for about two-thirds of the scholarships and bursaries comes from the&#13;
private sector. In 1993/94, UWI awarded more than 60 scholarships and 80 bursaries worth&#13;
approximately J$4.8 million and UTech administered over 100 scholarships totaling about J$3 million.&#13;
For most of the scholarships, eligibility is based on varying combinations of academic achievement,&#13;
6 The SLB hires additional staff to process the GOJ/Bankers' loan applications. These incremental administrative costs&#13;
are subsequently reimbursed to the SLB by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Culture (MOEYC). In 1993/94, the&#13;
MOEYC reimbursed the SLB J$322,929 (equivalent to 0.5% of loans disbursed) and is expected to reimburse&#13;
J$495,478 in 1994/95.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
need, extra-curricular activities, and interview performance. The Government awards a limited number&#13;
of performance-based scholarships to study at UWI on a competitive basis. The amount of each&#13;
scholarship varies, but most cover tuition plus a maintenance and book grant. In 1994/95, these awards&#13;
totaled J$3.6 million.&#13;
1.28  The University and UTech also administer small grants and short-term loans to students solely&#13;
on the basis of need with funds supplied by the Government's Social and Economic Support Program&#13;
(SESP) and institution-based welfare funds. The eligibility criteria for assistance at both institutions&#13;
include: enrollment in a full-time course; proof of inability to meet maintenance budget as attested to by&#13;
a minister of religion, Justice of the Peace, last school principal or employer; and good academic&#13;
standing except if lack of funds has contributed to poor academic performance. The financial assistance&#13;
schemes do not fund first-year students, as the grants and small loans are primarily a mechanism for&#13;
helping students cope with sudden changes in financial circumstances. As students in greatest need are&#13;
often those most reluctant to request assistance, both institutions rely on referrals of needy students by&#13;
wardens, lecturers, medical center staff and friends. In 1993/94, UWI disbursed 91 grants worth&#13;
approximately J$0.2 million and 182 loans worth about J$0.9 million. During the same year, UTech&#13;
disbursed J$ I million, mostly in grants. About 100 students participate in an Earn and Study Program&#13;
which provides jobs to students on campus for eight to twelve hours per week. The hourly rate,&#13;
currently J$30, is set so that students working eight hours can cover their lunch and bus fare.&#13;
GOVERNMENT'S EDUCATION STRATEGY&#13;
1.29        The Government's stated priority in the education sector is to provide a solid basic&#13;
education (i.e. Grades 1-9) to produce a literate, numerate and trainable population. Major reforms are&#13;
underway to improve the quality of both primary and lower secondary levels. In order to support this&#13;
priority area, the GOJ has indicated that over time it intends to increase the level of resources to basic&#13;
education by redirecting resources from tertiary education to lower levels where the social returns are&#13;
higher. A key element of this strategy is that budgetary subventions to tertiary institutions will be&#13;
reduced, as tuition fees are raised. In order to meet the increased demand for student loans, reform of&#13;
the student loan program is of high priority to the GOJ as a means to begin to rationalize the use of&#13;
resources in education, while at the same time contribute to the improvement of higher level human&#13;
capital development, and lay the foundation for future reforms in the financing of higher education (see&#13;
Letter of Sector Policy, para.2. 1 and Annex III).&#13;
BANK'S ROLE AND STRATEGY&#13;
1.30  Bank involvement in the proposed project is consistent with the Bank's country assistance&#13;
strategy: stimulating growth; reducing poverty and building human capital; and, improving&#13;
public/private sector balance. Reducing the government's share of financing of tertiary education by&#13;
sharing the costs with students and their parents is consistent with government's (and the Bank's')&#13;
strategy in the education sector. This would release public resources for priority areas within the&#13;
education sector (i.e. basic education). At the same time, the project would expand financial access to&#13;
higher education to students least able to afford the financial costs of tertiary education. Operationally,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
the Bank has already supported the Student Loan Bureau through an earlier project (Education&#13;
Program Preparation and Student Loan). The Bank is also providing major external assistance for the&#13;
government's Reform of Secondary Education Project (US$32 million). That project is expected to&#13;
expand the pool of students eligible for tertiary education, especially those from lower income groups.&#13;
LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
1.31  Since 1966, the Bank has supported five education projects in Jamaica totaling US$70 million.&#13;
In particular, the Education Program Preparation and Student Loan Project (US$8.3 million, effective&#13;
1988 and closed 12/94) supported the student loan program. With project proceeds the Government&#13;
transferred US$2.6 million to the SLB on a grant basis. In addition, the project sought to improve the&#13;
management and operation of the SLB and also provided computer equipment. While some&#13;
improvements were introduced during loan preparation (e.g. new procedural guidelines for loan&#13;
appraisal, aggressive collection strategies), an important agreement in the appraisal report, which stated&#13;
that the interest rate "should remain positive in real terms and in the long term cover normal costs of&#13;
operation", was not enforced during project implementation. In fact, it was not made an explicit legal&#13;
covenant, nor was it reviewed during Bank supervision visits (in part due to the rapid disbursement of&#13;
that component). As noted above, real interest rates were not maintained and contributed substantially&#13;
to low overall loan recovery rates and called into question the long-term financial sustainability of the&#13;
SLB's revolving student loan fund. In addition, administrative costs have been high and despite&#13;
improvements in the default rate due to the more aggressive collection strategies adopted as a result of&#13;
the project, (from 40% in the mid-1980s to 28% in 1989), non-performing loans (as estimated by the&#13;
SLB) are still high.&#13;
1.32  Experience worldwide with student loan schemes has tended to mirror the Jamaican experience.8&#13;
Heavily subsidized interest rates, high default rates and high administrative costs have resulted in low&#13;
recovery ratios. A common characteristic of many of these schemes is that they have been administered&#13;
by government ministries and agencies rather than by financial institutions such as banks. The&#13;
involvement of banks and other financial institutions can help make loan schemes more financially&#13;
sustainable, but the public sector must continue to bear some of the risk because banks are generally&#13;
unwilling to accept students' future earnings as collateral. Other requisites for sustainable schemes&#13;
include effective collection agents with incentives to minimize evasion and default and the maintenance&#13;
of positive real interest rates. The proposed project design has sought to address these problems and has&#13;
built in features which will help to increase the financial sustainability of a student loan scheme. The&#13;
commercial banks are involved in disbursing loans and will assume some of the repayment risk;&#13;
graduated payment schedules have been introduced to reduce both repayment burdens and default rates.&#13;
As opposed to the previous project, this project focuses only on student loans and hence supervision&#13;
will run the course of the project.&#13;

2. THE PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.1    At its very broadest level, the project supports the government's objective of shifting public&#13;
resources towards levels of education where the social returns are highest; (i.e., basic education).&#13;
Specifically, the project would: (a) provide Jamaican students (especially the neediest) with adequate&#13;
financing options to pay for their share of higher education on an ongoing basis; (b) increase equitable&#13;
access to tertiary education and improve targeting of subloans; and (c) increase financial sustainability&#13;
and administrative efficiency of the SLB through a consolidated student loan program. (Annex III)&#13;
PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
2.2   The project would support: (i) the restructuring of the SLB to focus on loan approval,&#13;
improved loan targeting and impact evaluation; (ii) the expansion of a targeted student loan program&#13;
administered by the commercial banking system; (iii) the establishment of a Grant-in-Aid Fund for&#13;
students least able to pay; and (iv) the development and implementation of a public awareness&#13;
campaign to inform students and their families of policy changes with respect to cost recovery and&#13;
financing options for tertiary education, including the Grant-in-Aid program.&#13;
Component 1: Institutional Strengthening (US$2.6 million, including contingencies)&#13;
2.3   The future role of the SLB will be to process loan and grant applications, monitor the overall&#13;
loan portfolio to determine performance and impact of the new scheme, and in collaboration with the&#13;
MOEYC and tertiary institutions, implement a public awareness campaign. In addition, the SLB will&#13;
continue to manage its existing loan portfolio until it is collected.9 The SLB will no longer disburse or&#13;
collect student loans directly to students under the expanded scheme; nor, will it make individual grant&#13;
disbursements to students. These functions will be handled by approved financial Institutions and&#13;
tertiary institutions, respectively.&#13;
2.4   The project would improve the management efficiency of the SLB through restructuring its&#13;
organization and staffing. A new SLB organizational structure has been proposed which reflects the&#13;
revised mandate of the SLB and scope of work (Annex II, Chart C). Overall, the number of positions&#13;
has been reduced from over 60 in the present Bureau to about 25 full-time staff&#13;
2.5   The project would also strengthen operational procedures, particularly loan application&#13;
processing, means testing and targeting. An Operational Manual defining the operational procedures&#13;
for the SLB, including its linkages with commercial banks and tertiary institutions, targeting criteria, and&#13;
monitorable indicators has been prepared. As a condition of effectiveness, an Operational Manual must&#13;
be adopted by the Borrower and the SLB and a functioning management information system (MIS)&#13;
must be operating in a manner satisfactory to the Bank (para. 7.2 (a)). A functioning MIS would be&#13;
capable of processing student financial assistance applications, determine their eligibility for subloans&#13;
and/or subgrants and be able to verify information from AFIs regarding the names of the students and&#13;
9 Given the low interest rate (12%) on existing loans and the proportion of delinquent loans that are overdue by more&#13;
than one year, the net present value of the existing SLB loan book is extremely low. Therefore, the SLB will&#13;
passively collect existing loans (e.g. maintain a collection window) in order to minimize administrative costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I1&#13;
the amounts of the corresponding Subloan Agreements and be able to generate an automated&#13;
withdrawal application request for reimbursement from the Bank's loan account.&#13;
2.6   As described below, it has been estimated that approximately one-third of tertiary students&#13;
would be eligible for student loans. However, the actual distribution of tertiary students by&#13;
consumption quintile is not known with complete accuracy. So although the means test would target&#13;
students from the poorest three quintiles (which on a national sample would represent 60% of the&#13;
population), it is not precisely known what proportion of tertiary students would be eligible. Therefore,&#13;
this component would support two rounds of a special survey of tertiary students (based on the&#13;
methodology to carry out the Survey of Living Conditions) to determine both the distribution of&#13;
benefits of the student loan and grant-in-aid programs by consumption quintiles, and the effectiveness of&#13;
the targeting and means testing conducted by the SLB (Annex IV). The first round would be conducted&#13;
in early 1997 based on the loan and grant applications received and reviewed during the first year of the&#13;
project.&#13;
2.7   The following inputs would be supported under this component: (i) technical assistance to&#13;
restructure the SLB; (ii) recruitment, hiring and training of staff, including local training in upgraded&#13;
procedures; (iii) technical assistance to prepare the Operational Manual and application forms and&#13;
support for their reproduction; (iv) upgrading of computer hardware and software for management and&#13;
financial information systems, including linkages with commercial banks; (v) support for studies,&#13;
including impact evaluation of which income groups are served by the loan program; (vi) technical&#13;
assistance for external mid-term and final evaluations; and (vii) one vehicle.&#13;
Component 2: Expanded Student Loan Scheme (US$ 27.0 million; including contingencies)&#13;
2.8  In order to assist students to meet increased private costs of tertiary education, this component&#13;
will provide funding for an expanded student loan scheme. The Bank's loan proceeds would be onlent&#13;
by the SLB to approved financial institutions (AFIs) (Annex V). Funds would then be onlent to tertiary&#13;
students deemed eligible by the SLB.&#13;
2.9   Sub-loan Processing. The SLB would no longer be responsible for the direct disbursement and&#13;
collection of student loans. Under the existing 1971 Students' Loan Fund Act, the SLB is not&#13;
empowered to enter into onlending operations with financial intermediaries, therefore, an amendment to&#13;
the Act is required in order to follow the structure designed by the proposed Project. As a condition of&#13;
effectiveness, an amendment to the Students' Loan Fund Act must be in full force and effect (para. 7.2&#13;
(b)). The SLB's function would be to receive and review a consolidated loan and grant application form&#13;
to determine eligibility on income grounds and ensure that students are in good academic standing. If&#13;
eligible, a loan equivalent up to 100% of tuition fees for the given area of study is reconmmended by the&#13;
SLB and the application is forwarded to an AFI of the student's choice. The AFI then disburses the&#13;
funds (a subloan) to the tertiary institution. Subloans are then consolidated by the AFI which then&#13;
obtains a loan ("Intermediary Loan") from the SLB on similar terms and conditions as those for student&#13;
sub-loans. In addition, AFIs would receive a 3.5% annual margin on the principal disbursed to cover&#13;
administration of the subloans. For all subloans, the government would provide a guarantee in the event&#13;
of death or disability for the period the student is in school and the 6 month grace period. For all loans,&#13;
the repayment length would be a maximum of 7 years. Shorter terms would be acceptable if mutually&#13;
agreed by the AFI and the borrower.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
2.10 Repayment risk. The risk would be shared by the AFIs and the Government of Jamaica as&#13;
follows. For subloans with collateral found acceptable by the AFI (at the time of application), the AFI&#13;
would agree to assume the repayment risk once students have graduated plus 6-month grace period&#13;
(Class "A" loans). For students, who upon graduating find employment satisfactory to the AFI, the&#13;
repayment risk (Class "B" loans) would be assumed by the AFI for the remainder of the sub-loan's term&#13;
(Annex I, Table 6). Those not falling into Class "A" or "B" would receive full GOJ guarantee (Class&#13;
"C" loans), but the bankers would exercise due diligence in collection to maximize recovery.&#13;
2.11   Subloan interest rate. In determining the interest rate to be charged to students, the cost to the&#13;
Government of borrowing from the Bank, including exchange rate risk, and affordability in terms of the&#13;
debt burden were taken into account (Annex I, Table 7 and Annex X). The interest rate charged during&#13;
the in-school and grace periods would be 15% annually but capitalized. Once repayment begins, the&#13;
interest rate converts to the average savings rate for deposits in Jamaican Dollars paid by commercial&#13;
banks in Jamaica plus 5 percentage points, adjusted annually on January 1 st. The average passbook&#13;
savings rate has been relatively stable around 19%. With the spread, a 24% interest rate would&#13;
presently cover GOJ's cost of funds from the Bank (an effective rate of approximately 17%) plus the&#13;
3.5% margin to be paid to the banks. Compared to the average commercial bank lending rate (over&#13;
50%), the interest subsidy is substantial. However, there are two arguments for adopting the structure&#13;
as proposed. First, the loan scheme is targeted to the poorest students. Second, because the subloans&#13;
are disbursed directly to the tertiary institutions for fees, it is unlikely that there will be any leakages to&#13;
allow for this subsidy to distort the general credit market. During negotiations. agreement was reached&#13;
that the interest rate will be at average passbook savings rate for deposits in Jamaican Dollars paid by&#13;
commercial banks in Jamaica plus 5 percentage point spread. adjusted annually on January 1 st (para.&#13;
7. 1 (a)).&#13;
2.12  Targeting. Because of the substantial interest rate subsidy, the loans would be targeted to&#13;
students from poorer backgrounds, approximately one-third of the tertiary student population. Targeting&#13;
will rely on income data submitted on the application form. Income information will be collected using&#13;
the question format contained in the 1993 Survey of Living Conditions (SLC) as this format produced&#13;
valid income data. Information will be collected on earned and unearned income. To determine the&#13;
applicant's available resources, the applicant's projected education costs (i.e. tuition) and the education&#13;
costs of any siblings or dependents who are enrolled in secondary or tertiary institutions will be&#13;
deducted from total income. Available resources will be adjusted for household size. Cutoff points for&#13;
eligibility will be included in the Operational Manual. As noted above (para. 2.6), given the paucity of&#13;
information concerning the present composition of the tertiary student body on income grounds, the&#13;
evaluation study monitoring the distribution of loan beneficiaries during the first year of the project&#13;
would be used to make adjustments cut-off points. Thereafter, cut-off points for eligibility will be&#13;
adjusted annually for inflation.&#13;
2.13  This component would support: (i) funds to expand the Students' Loan scheme; and (ii) margin&#13;
of 3.5% per year to AFIs to administer student subloans during the period students are in school plus 6&#13;
months grace.&#13;
Component 3: Grant-In-Aid Program (US$8.5 million, including contingencies)&#13;
2.14  Although students from poorer backgrounds would be eligible to borrow under the student loan&#13;
program, there will be substantial opportunity costs to them (and their families) in extending their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
education to the tertiary level in terms of foregone family income. Because subloans would not cover&#13;
living expenses, which are substantially more than tuition fees, mobilizing the remaining funds will be a&#13;
significant deterrent for poorer students. And, despite prospective higher earnings, students from poor&#13;
backgrounds may be reluctant to accumulate excessive debt. Therefore the project will also support a&#13;
targeted grant scheme for full-time UWI and Utech students only to help meet a share of outlays not&#13;
covered by subloans for students from low-income families. The component will provide funding for a&#13;
Grants-in-Aid program with overall administration by the SLB. Under the existing 1971 Students' Loan&#13;
Fund Act, the SLB is not empowered to provide grants to students, therefore, an amendment to such&#13;
Act is required in order to follow the structure designed by the Project. As a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
an amendment to the Students' Loan Fund Act must be in full force and effect (para. 7.2 (b)).&#13;
2.15  Student need would be assessed based on a comprehensive review by the SLB of the applicant's&#13;
overall financial requirements and available resources (including subloans, which would be mandatory&#13;
before students could receive a grant).'° Targeting criteria would be an extension of those used to&#13;
determine subloan eligibility; students from the bottom consumption quintile (representing&#13;
approximately 10% of the tertiary student body at UWI and UTech) will be eligible for a grant. For&#13;
second and third year students, UWI and UTech would be consulted in selection of students. Subgrants&#13;
would cover approximately 25% of housing and maintenance costs and books. Actual disbursements to&#13;
students will be handled by UWI and UTech in the form of a block grant to be transfered by the SLB.&#13;
Students would sign for subgrants when disbursed by the tertiary institution.&#13;
Component 4: Public Awareness Campaign (US$0.4 million, including contingencies)&#13;
2.16 The project would support a public awareness campaign to disseminate information among&#13;
students, parents and the general public about policy changes for increased cost sharing and the options&#13;
available for meeting those costs. The project would support technical assistance to develop the public&#13;
awareness campaign, implement mass media campaigns and produce materials designed to: (i) explain&#13;
Government's policy regarding higher education; (ii) explain the operation of financial aid programs&#13;
(loans and grants); and (iii) promote understanding of the significance of debt obligations. In the first&#13;
and fourth years of the project, the evaluation survey will also provide feedback from students on their&#13;
experiences and satisfaction with the student loan program (Annex IV).&#13;
2.17 The SLB would have overall responsibility of the campaign, but would liaise with the MOEYC's&#13;
Tertiary Unit, the tertiary institutions, secondary institutions with prospective students and financial&#13;
institutions in terms of developing and disseminating the materials.&#13;
2.18  Project support would include: (i) local technical assistance to develop suitable materials&#13;
(consultants would work in conjunction with banks and tertiary institutions); (ii) supplies and&#13;
reproduction costs; (iii) rental of TV, radio, and newspaper spots; (iv) one vehicle and per diem travel&#13;
expenses for the SLB public relations person and MOEYC staff.&#13;
10 Exceptions would be made for poor students receiving scholarships or bursaries to cover tuition costs.&#13;

3. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
PROJECT COSTS&#13;
3.1    Project costs. Total project costs, including physical and price contingencies, are estimated at&#13;
US$38.5 million. Foreign exchange costs and local costs excluding taxes and duties amount to US$0.4&#13;
million (1%) and US$ 38.1 million (99%), respectively. Table 3.1 summarizes estimated project costs&#13;
by component. Annex VI provides a further breakdown of project costs.&#13;

3.2    Basis of cost estimates. Project costs are estimated at December 1995 prices. Costs of&#13;
equipment and materials are based on agreed lists of items and on the CIF prices of the items procured&#13;
in the country. Costs of training, local and international consultants and other services reflect local or&#13;
international rates, where applicable.&#13;
3.3    Contingency allowances. There are no physical contingencies, while price contingencies&#13;
(averaging -3% of base costs) were estimated on the basis of expected annual foreign inflation&#13;
averaging 3.2% for the life of the project; and local price increases of 15% for 1996, 12% for 1997 and&#13;
1998, and 10% per year thereafter.&#13;
3.4   Incremental recurrent costs. Total incremental recurrent costs generated over the life of the&#13;
project life are estimated to be US$2.0 million, mostly generated by salaries for the incremental SLB&#13;
staff and by operations and maintenance costs of the new MIS. These costs will be financed on a&#13;
declining basis.&#13;
3.5   Foreign Exchange component. Direct and indirect foreign exchange costs are estimated at&#13;
about J$18.0 million (US$0.4 equivalent), including contingencies. The foreign exchange component&#13;
for the major categories was estimated as follows: student loans (0%); grants (0%); equipment (100%),&#13;
foreign consultants (100%) and training (5%).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
FINANCING PLAN&#13;
3.6   Total project costs are estimated at US$38.5 million. A Bank loan of US$28.5 million would&#13;
finance 74% of total project costs excluding taxes. The loan would cover 75% of investment costs;&#13;
96% of foreign exchange expenditures (US$ 0.4 million) and 74% of the local exchange expenditures&#13;
(US$28.1 million). The Borrower will finance the remaining US$10.0 million. While the Bank loan&#13;
would fully finance the Student Loan Scheme component, the Borrower will be the sole financing of the&#13;
Grant-in-Aid Program component (Table 3.2). The Bank loan would be a single currency loan&#13;
denominated in US dollars, to be repaid in 17 years, including 5 years' grace at the standard interest rate&#13;
for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans.&#13;

3.7    Retroactive financing. Retroactive financing of up to US$2.8 million will be provided for&#13;
expenditures made under components A and D as shown in Table 3.2 in accordance with Bank&#13;
procurement guidelines after August 31, 1995. Disbursements made under the Student Loan Scheme&#13;
component will not be eligible. Retroactive financing is recommended to ensure that technical&#13;
assistance and upgrading of computer hardware and software for financial and management information&#13;
systems necessary for the timely implementation of the project begins with sufficient lead time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
IMLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
4.1   The proposed project will be completed in 5 years, however, most technical assistance and all&#13;
procurement will be completed within 6 months of Loan effectiveness and all recommendations for&#13;
procedural or organizational changes within SLB should be implemented within 6 months of Loan&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
PROJECT MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.2   The SLB will be the executing agency and under existing legislation, the SLB reports to the&#13;
Student Loan Council which is comprised of between 9-1 1 members appointed by the Minister of&#13;
Finance. The Council in turn reports to the Minister of Finance (Annex II, Chart C). The SLB will have&#13;
overall responsibility for project implementation. It will directly execute: processing and approval of&#13;
subloans and subgrants; maintenance of the management information system for the subloans and&#13;
subgrants; administration of an on-going public awareness campaign; liaison with tertiary institutions.&#13;
During negotiations, a Project Agreement between the Bank and the SLB was discussed and agreed&#13;
(para. 7.1 (b)). The SLB will also ensure that budgetary, procurement, contracting, disbursement,&#13;
administrative, accounting, auditing and reporting requirements are carried out in accordance with the&#13;
provisions of the Project Agreement.&#13;
4.3   Key staff for the SLB have been identified and will be in place as of June 1, 1996. These staff&#13;
include: Executive Director, Manager of the MIS unit, and the Public Relations Officer. They will work&#13;
with GOJ staff and consultants to finalize the Operational Manual, adapt and install hardware and&#13;
software systems to administer the Student Loan Scheme, and begin to prepare materials for the public&#13;
awareness campaign. During negotiations, agreement was reached that the SLB will implement the&#13;
proiect in accordance with the agreed Operational Manual, which shall not be changed without the&#13;
Bank's consent (para. 7.1 (c)).&#13;
4.4   Institutional Linkages. The proceeds of the Bank loan will be transferred by the GOJ to the&#13;
SLB (on a grant basis) under a Subsidiary Grant Agreement in order to enable SLB to carry out the&#13;
activities under the proposed Project, including the activities under the expanded Student Loan Scheme&#13;
Component. With respect to the expanded Student Loan Scheme component, the SLB will onlend a&#13;
portion of the loan proceeds to each AFI under a Participation Agreement (the loan from SLB to a&#13;
Financial Intermediary will be called an Intermediary Loan). In turn, the Financial Intermediary will&#13;
onlend a portion of the proceeds of the Intermediary Loan to each eligible student under a Subloan&#13;
Agreement. As a conditions of effectiveness, the Borrower will: (a) execute the Subsidiarv Grant&#13;
Agreement between itself and the SLB: and (b) confirm that at least two Participation Agreements with&#13;
Approved Financial Institutions have been signed (para. 7.2 (c &amp; d)).&#13;
4.5   For the Grant-in-Aid component, the SLB will disburse block grants to tertiary institutions&#13;
based on individual student grant awards. A subgrant agreement should be entered into by the SLB,&#13;
students and the tertiary institutions. Although tertiary institutions will disburse funds directly to&#13;
beneficiaries, students will sign the agreement on receipt of grant funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
4.6    The SLB will liaise with secondary and tertiary institutions and the mass media to inform&#13;
students and their parents about the Students' Loan Scheme and Grant-in-Aid program. The SLB will&#13;
also liaise with tertiary institutions to validate student status to determine eligibility for both subloans&#13;
and subgrants. The SLB will report to the AFIs when the academic status of students changes.&#13;
PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.7    Procurement of goods under the proposed project will be carried out in accordance with&#13;
"Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in January&#13;
1995 and revised in January 1996. The bulk of the loan proceeds (95%) will be handled through&#13;
Financial Institutions. Limited amounts of equipment and consultant services will be procured as shown&#13;
in Table 4.1. Under the Institutional Strengthening component computer equipment, estimated to cost&#13;
$150,000 or less in total, will be procured through Limited International Bidding (LIB) among all&#13;
international suppliers with service facilities in Jamaica. Vehicles estimated to cost US$30,000 or less&#13;
in total, will be procured using international shopping procedures. Other office equipment and supplies&#13;
estimated to cost $15,000 or less per contract and less than $25,000 in total will be procured using&#13;
national shopping procedures. Consultants will be selected and employed in accordance with the World&#13;
Bank "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" published in August 1981.&#13;
Whenever appropriate, Bank-issued standard forms of contract will be used for consulting assignments.&#13;
Prior review would be required for all contracts awarded under LIB and for all consulting services&#13;
contracts regardless of their value.&#13;

4.8    The proposed Bank loan would finance about 74% of the total estimated project cost net of&#13;
taxes. Disbursement percentages for the various categories of expenditure are presented in Annex VI,&#13;
Table 4. For subloans, 100% of the amount onlent by an AFI to a student will be eligible for Bank&#13;
financing. The estimated schedule of disbursements is shown in Annex VI, Table 5.&#13;
4.9    A Special Account in US dollars would be established and maintained to facilitate&#13;
implementation. Due to the rapid disbursements expected within the first months after Loan&#13;
effectiveness, a Special Account with an initial deposit of US$2.8 million would be opened for the SLB&#13;
in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank. The SLB would be authorized on behalf of the Borrower&#13;
to sign applications for withdrawal to implement activities under the project.&#13;
4.10   Required Documentation. Disbursements for subloans, administration fees, training,&#13;
operational expenditures, and goods (other than computer equipment and software) costing less than&#13;
US$150,000 would be made on the basis of SOEs, for which supporting documents would be retained&#13;
in the SLB and made available to the Bank for review during the course of normal project supervision.&#13;
The SLB Executive Director will be responsible for submitting aggregated eligible expenditures under&#13;
each heading and for preparing withdrawal applications for submission to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
ACCOUNTING AND AuDrrs&#13;
4.11  During negotiations. agreement was reached that the SLB will maintain records and accounts for&#13;
each project component and consolidate them into the project accounts and SOEs (para. 7.1 (d)).&#13;
Expenditures under subloans (i.e. Component B) would be disbursed on the basis of statements of&#13;
expenditure (SOEs) submitted by the SLB. Supporting documentation will be maintained by the SLB&#13;
and made available to Bank missions and independent auditors as required.&#13;
4.12  Project accounts, including the special account and SOEs will be audited annually in accordance&#13;
with appropriate auditing principles applied by external private independent auditors acceptable to the&#13;
Bank, with terms of reference for auditors and reports approved by the Bank. During negotiations.&#13;
agereement was reached that the audit reports would contain separate opinions regarding the existence&#13;
and reliability of the supporting documentation for disbursements based on SOEs (i.e. student loans)&#13;
(para. 7.1 (e)). During, negzotiations, agreement was reached that the Borrower select independent&#13;
auditors acceptable to the Bank to audit project accounts, and provide copies of the audited statements&#13;
to the Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal year (para. 7.1 (f)). The cost of the consultant&#13;
services to be employed for the annual audits will be eligible for financing under the loan.&#13;
PROJECT MONITORING, SUPERVISION AND EVALUATION&#13;
4.13  The SLB will be responsible for the timely implementation, monitoring and evaluation of project&#13;
activities. Durine negotiations. the SLB and the Bank agreed on monitorable indicators (para. 7.1 (g)&#13;
and Annex VII). Agreement was also reached that the SLB will: (a) prepare and submit semiannual&#13;
project implementation reports to the Bank by April 30 and October 31 of each year: (b) carrv out.&#13;
alone with the Borrower and the Bank. an annual review of the progeress made in the implementation of&#13;
the project by May 31 of each year: (c) conduct a mid-term review of the project. along with the Bank&#13;
and the Borrower, by May 31. 1998: and (d) prepare the Project Implementation Completion Report.&#13;
including a plan for the future sustainability of the SLB (para. 7.1 (h)). Project performance indicators&#13;
(as specified in Annex VII) will be included in the annual reports in order to track the progress made.&#13;
In addition to annual reviews which would take place in May, interim visits (e.g. in November) would&#13;
continue to review the progress in the implementation of the project soon after disbursements have been&#13;
made to students at the start of the academic year (Annex VIII). The project would require about 15&#13;
staff weeks supervision in the first fiscal year (7 of which in the field) and 9 weeks thereafter (4 of which&#13;
in the field). Where possible use would be made of the social sector specialist in the Resident Mission.&#13;
STATUS OF PREPARATION&#13;
4.14   The Minister of Finance requested the project to respond to tuition increases at the UWI&#13;
effective September 1996. Accordingly, a Bank identification mission visited Jamaica in January 1995,&#13;
followed by a preparation mission in May 1995. A pre-appraisal mission in December 1995 confirmed&#13;
the participation of commercial banks. The project was appraised in March 1996 and negotiations were&#13;
held in June 1996. Loan effectiveness is estimated for August 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
5. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS &amp; SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
5.1   The Bank loan will provide an initial injection to capitalize the student loan scheme for five&#13;
years. Analysis was done to determine whether it is costlier to the GOJ to administer a student loan&#13;
program compared to the government giving pure grants to poor students. The level of analysis focuses&#13;
on the net cost of the loan scheme as opposed to whether or not the program is fully sustainable (see&#13;
Annex IX for more detail). Examining the net fiscal impact of the program was considered appropriate&#13;
given that no student loan program could ever be fully financially sustainable (in the sense of being self-&#13;
financing) because of the offsetting effect of higher interest rates on default rates.&#13;
5.2   The net fiscal costs to the Government were estimated for extending student subloans to one-&#13;
third of tertiary students (about 5,000) over a five year period and compared to the expected tuition&#13;
revenues from that same group of students. The analysis showed that the annual cost of the student&#13;
loan program was less than the value of the fees that would be collected from the portion of students&#13;
receiving loans--thus releasing funds from the tertiary level that could be reallocated elsewhere in the&#13;
education sector. The net present value of the stream of costs for extending loans over a five year&#13;
period was also less than the net present value of the fees paid by the borrowing students. On a per&#13;
student basis, the net subsidy element to a poor student of a J$100,000 loan would be 30%, compared&#13;
to 100% (plus administrative costs) for a grant scheme and nearly 80% for the present student loan&#13;
scheme. The magnitude of the costs in part depends on the default rate. For example, under more&#13;
pessimistic assumptions (i.e. a default rate of 30% with inflation running at 20% annually), the subsidy&#13;
of the loan is 48%, substantially less than the present loan scheme. Nevertheless, containing the default&#13;
potential will be an important strategy in keeping net costs reasonable and containing the subsidy&#13;
element.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
6. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
6.1   The project would: (a) create an enabling environment to mobilize greater private resources at&#13;
the tertiary level thus increasing government's ability to redirect resources toward basic education; (b)&#13;
contribute to human resource development by enabling more Jamaican students to pursue higher&#13;
education; which in turn will provide scarce professional skills in both the public and private sectors; (c)&#13;
increase access to higher education for students from lower socio-economic backgrounds; and, (d)&#13;
contribute to improved quality of education, as students are able to place more legitimate demands on&#13;
quality education commensurate with higher private costs.&#13;
PROJECT RISKS&#13;
6.1   The principal risk is the extent to which potentially high default rates would increase the cost of&#13;
the Student Loan Scheme to the Government. Commercial banks have agreed to accept the repayment&#13;
risk for a portion of students, namely those with adequate collateral at the time of application and those&#13;
students who after graduation had found acceptable employment. For all other students, the&#13;
government would continue to provide full guarantee. To reduce default rates of loans carrying&#13;
government guarantee, banks would treat these as any other commercial debt obligation and fulfill&#13;
minimum defined collection procedures before seeking recourse under the government guarantee.&#13;
Collection efforts will also be monitored by the SLB based on quarterly information provided by the&#13;
banks. Default rates would then be compared across participating banks. Should the default rate for a&#13;
single AFI greatly exceed that of the average of the participating AFIs, the SLB would retain the right&#13;
to revoke the certification of the AFI and suspend new student subloan commitments. To minimize&#13;
default from the perspective of the students, salary deduction orders would be requested by the banks&#13;
where possible. A disclosure waiver to publish the names of students in default and release their names&#13;
to credit bureaus would be sought by the banks when students sign subloan agreements. Lastly, in&#13;
order to reduce the burden of payments, subloan repayment schedules would be graduated.&#13;
6.2   A second risk relates to potential backlash from students and families, primarily those who are&#13;
no longer eligible for subsidized loans (given tighter and more narrow targeting). To address this, a&#13;
public awareness campaign is included in the project to explain to the general public and to parents and&#13;
students the government's policy on financing tertiary education.&#13;
6.3   Finally, as designed, the Student Loan Scheme involves the participation of the AFIs. In&#13;
addition, the SLB will also administer the grant-in-aid program. Therefore, the Students' Loan Fund&#13;
Act (which instituted the SLB and regulates its operations) must be amended to enable the SLB to carry&#13;
out the mentioned programs under the Project. As of today, such amendment has been approved by the&#13;
Borrower's Cabinet. However, to be in full force and effect, such amendment must be approved by the&#13;
Borrower's Parliament and signed by the Governor General. This risk may be minimized by the fact that&#13;
the current government has a majority in Parliament. Additionally, on June 27, 1996 the Bank has&#13;
received written assurances from the Minister of Finance and Planning that the amendment will be in full&#13;
force and effect by late July. The Bank has, however, required that the amendment to the Students'&#13;
Loan Fund Act be in full force and effect as a condition of effectiveness of the Loan Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
7. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
7.1   During negotiations, it was agreed that:&#13;
(a)   the interest rate will be average savings rate for deposits in Jamaican Dollars paid by&#13;
commercial banks in Jamaica plus 5 percentage point spread and that it will be adjusted&#13;
annually on January 1st (para. 2.11);&#13;
(b)   there will be a Project Agreement between the Bank and the SLB, the contents of which&#13;
are also agreed (para. 4.2);&#13;
(c)   the SLB will implement the project in accordance with the agreed Operational Manual,&#13;
which shall not be changed without the Bank's consent (para. 4.3);&#13;
(d)   the SLB maintain records and accounts for each project component and consolidate&#13;
them into the project accounts and SOEs (para. 4.11);&#13;
(e)   the audit reports would contain separate opinions regarding the existence and reliability&#13;
of the supporting documentation for disbursements based on SOEs (i.e. student loans)&#13;
(para. 4.12);&#13;
(f)   the Government select independent auditors acceptable to the Bank to audit project&#13;
accounts, and provide copies of the audited statements to the Bank within six months of&#13;
the end of each fiscal year (para. 4.12);&#13;
(g)   on the monitorable indicators (para. 4.13); and,&#13;
(h)   the SLB:&#13;
(i)   prepare and submit semiannual project implementation reports to the Bank by&#13;
April 30 and October 31 of each year;&#13;
(ii)   carry out, along with the Bank, an annual review of the progress made in the&#13;
implementation of the project by May 31 of each year;&#13;
(iii) conduct a mid-term review of the project, along with the Bank, by May 31, 1998;&#13;
and&#13;
(iv)   prepare the Project Implementation Completion Report (para. 4.13).&#13;
7.2   As conditions of effectiveness:&#13;
(a)   an Operational Manual must be adopted by the Borrower and the SLB and a functioning&#13;
management information system (MIS) must be operating in a manner satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank (para. 2.5);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
(b)   amendment to the Student Loan Fund Act must be in full force and effect (paras. 2.9 and&#13;
2.14);&#13;
(c)   a Subsidiary Grant Agreement between the GOJ and the SLB has been executed (para.&#13;
4.4); and,&#13;
(d)   the GOJ will confirm that it has signed at least two Participation Agreements with&#13;
Approved Financial Institutions (para. 4.4).&#13;
7.3   Recommendation: Subject to the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project&#13;
would constitute a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$28.5 million at the standard interest rate&#13;
for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loan repayable on 17 years including a five year&#13;
grace period.&#13;

Dear Ms. Armstrong&#13;
Re: Government of Jamaica Policy and Financing Education&#13;
1.    Cost-Sharing&#13;
The Government of Jamaica has embarked on a number of activities&#13;
aimed at improving the quality of the nation's education system.&#13;
The Government recognizes that most of the problems facing the&#13;
system can be attributed to the Inadequacy of the resources&#13;
available to the sector. However, Government's efforts to&#13;
finance education compares well with International norms hence,&#13;
sizeable increases In government expenditure on education will&#13;
not be feasible in the short term.&#13;
The Government has embarked on  cost-sharing scheme_. which form an&#13;
Integral part of Its policy on financing education. The schemes&#13;
now operate on the following bases:&#13;
I)    Government provides full support for Primary Educatlon;&#13;
iI)    Private participation through fee payment at the&#13;
Secondary and tertiary levels;&#13;
1ii)   Careful targeting accompanied by support schemes to&#13;
assist those who cannot afford to pay the full fees.&#13;
Support schemes will operate as follows:&#13;
a)     At the secondary level - Grants&#13;
b).... /Over&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
2.&#13;
b)     At the tertiary level - Loans and Grants&#13;
Iv)  Ensure efficeint use of all resources.&#13;
2.   Allocation of Government Resources&#13;
The prioritization of primary education and constraint on&#13;
Government allocation to the sector will require an allocation of&#13;
resources which maintains the viability of the system while&#13;
skewing resources to the basic levels. Government will therefore&#13;
pursue strategies which will re-allocate recurrent expenditures&#13;
within the the next ten years as follows:-&#13;
Early Childhood and Primary           50%&#13;
Secondary                             33%&#13;
Tertiary                               15%&#13;
With the proposed reduction In allocation to tertiary education,&#13;
Government will maintain a targeted students loan and grant&#13;
programme. The loan being negotiated with the World Bank will&#13;
be used to Initiate this programme.&#13;
Yours sincerely&#13;

Annex IV: Evaluation Impact Study&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
Objective&#13;
To determine:&#13;
* the distribution of benefits of the student loan and grant-in-aid programs by&#13;
consumption quintiles;&#13;
* the effectiveness of the targetting and means testing conducted by the SLB; and,&#13;
* the effectiveness of the public awareness campaign.&#13;
Methodology&#13;
The Survey of Living Conditions is a household survey which has been conducted each&#13;
year in November since 1988. Although the information collected through these surveys&#13;
has enabled the GOJ to estimate the population by consumption quintiles, it has not been&#13;
useful for estimating the distribution of tertiary students by such quintiles for the simple&#13;
reason that most students are not living at home when the survey is conducted. However,&#13;
using the core modules of the SLC, (expenditure data, durable goods, housing etc.), it is&#13;
possible to design a special module to assess:&#13;
o incidence of loans by consumption quintile&#13;
o incidence of grants by consumption quintile&#13;
o actual education costs and sources of financing for those costs, including the loan and&#13;
grant program, as well as other sources&#13;
- public awareness and knowledge of the loan and grant programs&#13;
* credit education&#13;
? transaction costs and consumer burden&#13;
- consumer experiences and satisfaction with different aspects of program operation&#13;
Using the SLC as a basis will allow the students' welfare to be compared with the existing&#13;
national distribution. This will make data interpretation relatively simple. It also greatly&#13;
reduces the costs by eliminating the need for most of the design and testing stages of an&#13;
instrument as well as the need for a control group.&#13;
Sample Composition&#13;
The sample of a minimum of 300 students should be drawn from each of four pools:&#13;
Group                           Sample Frame&#13;
All students or non-applicants  Registrars' lists&#13;
Rejected applicants             SLB&#13;
Accepted applicants             SLB&#13;
Grant recipients               SLB or registrar&#13;
It may be necessary to gather information on both the student's household and that of&#13;
his/her parents. This would certainly be the case for dependent students. It may also be&#13;
desirable to gather information on parents of independent students to determine whether&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
"independence" is being manipulated to qualify on income grounds for a loan. It is&#13;
assumed that for each student in the sample, two households would have to be&#13;
interviewed. Therefore, the total sample should consist of 2,400 interviews.&#13;
Implementation&#13;
It is proposed that the evaluation be carried out twice during the project. It should be&#13;
done in the first year, after the award of loans and grants. This would allow for&#13;
adjustments in procedures and thresholds early in the project to ensure that the there is not&#13;
either substantial leakage of loans to higher income groups or, under coverage of the&#13;
poorest students for either loans and/or grants. The evaluation would be repeated in the&#13;
fourth year, again after loan and grant decisions had been made, to assess how the mature&#13;
system was functioning. It is proposed that STATIN would carry out the data collection,&#13;
data entry and construction of the consumption aggregates. The design of the new&#13;
module and the analysis should be contracted out.&#13;
Timing&#13;
Round One: The design of the special module should be done as soon after project&#13;
effectiveness as possible. Following the award of loans and grants by September 1996,&#13;
fieldwork could be carried out in January/February 1997 with analysis to follow in March.&#13;
Incorporation of the findings of the evaluation should be done no later than May 1997 in&#13;
order in enable dissemination of any changes in thresholds or loan processing procedures&#13;
for the following academic year.&#13;
Round Two: As above, in the fourth year of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex V: Certification Criteria for Participation of Approved Financial&#13;
Instituitions (AFIs)&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Exposure of potential Financial Institutions for students loans is very low under the&#13;
current GOJ/Bankers' Scheme Student Loan Program. As Annex V, Table 1 shows, the&#13;
proportion of student loans as a share of both loans and assets is currently less than 1%.&#13;
2.    Assuming that students' expressed preference for banks in the expanded Student&#13;
Loan Scheme continues to be diversified among the handful of banks currently involved in&#13;
the GOJ/Bankers Scheme, and that these banks' asset base and total loan portfolio does&#13;
not grow, then by Year 5 of the project student loans as a share of assets remain below&#13;
3% for all banks. Even for the largest participating bank in the student loan market, the&#13;
share of student loans in total loans is only 7%.&#13;
3.    Under an ongoing World Bank supported project, Private Investment and Export&#13;
Development Project (Ln. 3720-JM, signed April, 1994), technical assistance is being&#13;
provided to the GOJ to improve currently weak reporting requirements for and financial&#13;
regulation governing Financial Institutions. The project also calls for legislation to be&#13;
updated to support these improvements. A dated covenent in this Project requires that&#13;
regulations to the Banking Act and the Financial Institutions Act be adopted and that the&#13;
Prudential Regulations be revised by March 31, 1997.&#13;
Certification Criteria&#13;
4.    Given the size of the student loan portfolio in any potential Financial Intermediary&#13;
and the current weakness of reporting requirements and the general paucity of data on&#13;
which to assess the financial soundness of Financial Intermediaries in great detail, the&#13;
certification criteria for AFIs for the Student Loan Program will be:&#13;
(i)   that the Financial Institution is in compliance with the Financial Institutions Act&#13;
(1992), the Banking Act (1992) or other laws and prudential regulations as determined by&#13;
the Bank of Jamaica. AFIs should also be current in meeting their obligation of having&#13;
their financial statements audited by external auditors. The SLB would have the right at&#13;
any time to revoke the certification of Financial Institutions found by the Bank of Jamaica&#13;
to be in violation of these Acts or regulations.&#13;
(ii)  the SLB also retains the right to revoke the certification of the AFI and suspend&#13;
new student sub-loan commitments should:&#13;
(a) the AFI not exercise due diligence in the collection of subloans in accordance&#13;
with indicators set forth in the Operational Manual; or&#13;
(b) the default rate expressed as the number student sub-loans (Class "C") exceed&#13;
the average of participating AFIs.&#13;

Annex IX: Fiscal Impact of Proposed Scheme and&#13;
Alternative Interest and Default Rates&#13;
This Annex analyzes the proposed project in terms of its fiscal impact in the&#13;
context of government policy of cost recovery at the tertiary level. It addresses the&#13;
question of whether it is costlier to the Govemment to administer a student loan program&#13;
compared to giving pure grants to poor students. The second section discusses altemative&#13;
interest rates considered during project preparation, while the third section presents a&#13;
sensitivity analysis of the impact of different levels of the default rates on the net cost of&#13;
the proposed program.&#13;
A.    Net Cost of the Proposed Program&#13;
The level of analysis focusses on the net cost of the loan scheme and not whether&#13;
the program is fully sustainable. Examining the net fiscal impact of the program is&#13;
appropriate given that no student loan program could ever be fully financially sustainable&#13;
(in the sense of being self-financing) because of the negative effect of higher interest rates&#13;
on default rates. The fiscal impact of two options--a loan scheme and a grant program--&#13;
are considered.&#13;
The net fiscal costs to the Government have been estimated for a ten year period.&#13;
The main cost factors of student loan programs are: (i) interest subsidies; (ii) default&#13;
rates; and (iii) administrative costs. Also included in the cost of the proposed student&#13;
loan program is the cost of borrowing from the World Bank to finance a five-year&#13;
injection of funds. Table 1 compares the cost of extending student loans to one-third of&#13;
tertiary students (about 5,000) over a five year period to the expected tuition revenues&#13;
from that same group of students. Under given assumptions', the cost of the student loan&#13;
program in each year is less than the value of the fees that would be collected from the&#13;
portion of students receiving loans--thus releasing funds from the tertiary level that could&#13;
be reallocated elsewhere in the education sector. The net present value of the stream of&#13;
costs for extending loans over a five year period is J$690.4 million; the net present value&#13;
of the tuition fees paid by the borrowing students is J$1,466 million. Even under more&#13;
pessimistic assumptions (i.e. inflation running at 20% annually and a default rate of&#13;
'Macro-economic assumptions include: Inflation at 15% over the next 10 years; for the devaluation of the&#13;
J$ it is assumed that the 7.5% interest rate on the WB US dollar loan translates into a 17% cost of&#13;
funds figure (assuming an average annual devaluation of 8.5% over the next 5 years); a discount&#13;
factor of 20% representing the opportunity cost of money.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;
30%), the net present value of the stream of costs (J$1,189 million) is still less than the&#13;
net present value of the stream of revenues.&#13;

The net costs per student of a J$100,000 loan are given in Table 2.2 Given the&#13;
assumptions, the loan program  would have a net subsidy (in terns of net present value) to&#13;
poor students of 30%  compared with 100%  subsidy element under a grant scheme, and&#13;
compared to nearly 80% under the government's present student loan scheme. Under the&#13;
more pessimistic assumption of higher inflation (20%) and default rates (30%), the&#13;
subsidy of the loan is 48%, substantially less than the present loan scheme.&#13;

B. Interest Rate Structures&#13;
During project preparation, consideration was given to an interest rate structure&#13;
that ideally would cover repayment of World Bank loan (including any potential foreign&#13;
exchange risk) and reflect a debt burden that is perceived to be, and is, manageable by the&#13;
borrowers. In determining an appropriate interest rate to charge students, it became&#13;
apparent that a trade-off exists between setting nominal interest rates high enough to&#13;
cover real costs and acheiving an acceptable debt burden. As Table 3 shows, as interest&#13;
rates increase, the burden on the student to repay becomes higher, in turn triggering a&#13;
likely increase in the default rate. In particular, two options of benchmarking the interest&#13;
rate were considered: Treasury Bills and average savings rate.&#13;
Option 1: Treasury Bill (TBill) Charging the students a market interest rate&#13;
based on some relationship with the Treasury bill was explored during project&#13;
preparation. The TBill has the advantage of offering an objective benchmark and reflects&#13;
local market forces, but is lower than local lending rates. The yield on 6-month TBills&#13;
jumped from 36% in November to 42.5% in December 1995; average commerical bank&#13;
loan rates rose from 53% to 55% over the same period. The TBill rate includes market&#13;
expectations regarding the inflation and devaluation risks, thus cost recovery (in terms of&#13;
cost of funds plus currency risk) should be achieved. The TBill, however, has wide&#13;
fluctuations, but could still be used as a benchmark by smoothing the fluctuations using a&#13;
six-month or annual moving average of the (6-month) TBill rate.&#13;
Although the T Bill rate would cover exchange rate risks and inflationary&#13;
expectations, it was not considered appropriate as a benchmark for student loans for&#13;
several reasons. At a time when Government is pursing an aggressive monetary policy to&#13;
mop up excess liquidity, it would not be fair to ask students, particularly those from poor&#13;
families, to bear the cost of the policy. Second, given that students will be faced with a&#13;
two-fold increase in fees, market interest rates may not be politically feasible, making&#13;
tertiary education appear even less accessible for students from poor backgrounds. High&#13;
interest rates may also discourage them from even applying for a loan. Finally, the initial&#13;
debt service burden of an interest rate (based on the TBill) of even 35% would be&#13;
equivalent to 26% of a reasonable initial salary of J$230,000, based on a flat repayment&#13;
plan (see Table 3). Under a graduated repayment plan, the initial burden drops to just&#13;
over 20%. Commercial bankers in Jamaica were of the opinion that the debt service&#13;
burden on student loans should not exceed a range of 17-18% of income. An official&#13;
from the U.S. student loan program noted that the rule of thumb in the United States was&#13;
that debt service burden should be in the range of 5-6%.3&#13;
Option 2: Average savings rate A second option that was proposed was the&#13;
average (passbook) savings rate plus a spread of 5 percentage points (the same rate&#13;
charged on the GOJ/Bankers' Scheme). It has the advantage of being relatively stable&#13;

over time--it remains at 18%, but runs a greater risk than the TBill rate of being negative&#13;
in real terms. In terms of debt service, an interest rate of say, 25% would give 20% debt&#13;
service burden assuming a flat repayment schedule. Under a graduated schedule, the&#13;
initial debt service burden falls to 15.8%.&#13;

C.    Default Rates&#13;
The principle risk of the proposed operation is the extent to which potentially high&#13;
default rates increase the cost of the loan program. Table 4 presents a sensitivity analysis&#13;
of the net cost under varying assumptions for default rates. A doubling of the default rate&#13;
from 10% to 20% results in a 30% increase in the net cost of the program.&#13;

            Jamaica - Student Loan Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            At its very broadest level, the Student
            Loan Project supports the government's objective of
            shifting public resources towards levels of education where
            the social returns are highest. Specifically, the project
            will: a) provide Jamaican students with adequate financing
            options to pay for their share of higher education on an
            ongoing basis; b) increase equitable access to tertiary
            education and improve targeting of subloans; and c) increase
            financial sustainability and administrative efficiency of
            the Students' Loan Bureau (SLB) through a consolidated
            student loan program. The project will support: a) the
            restructuring of the SLB to focus on loan approach, improved
            loan targeting and impact evaluation; b) the expansion of a
            targeted student loan program administered by the commercial
            banking system; c) the establishment of a grant-in-aid Fund
            for students least able to pay; and d) the development and
            implementation of a public awareness campaign to inform
            students and their families of policy changes with respect
            to cost recovery and financing options for tertiary
            education, including the Grant-in-Aid program.
