        <abstracts>
            Benchmarking is now well recognized as
            an important mechanism for introducing accountability in
            service delivery. Sustained benchmarking can help utilities
            in identifying performance gaps and effecting improvements
            through the sharing of information and best practices,
            ultimately resulting in better services to people.
            Recognizing its importance, the Ministry of Urban
            Development (MoUD), Government of India, has launched
            service level benchmarking (SLB) covering water; sanitation,
            solid waste management, and storm water drainage. It
            envisages a shift in focus from infrastructure creation to
            delivery of service outcomes. A handbook on SLB has been
            released by MoUD that provides a framework of performance
            indicators, along with detailed monitoring guidelines and
            service goals that need to be achieved in a phased manner.
