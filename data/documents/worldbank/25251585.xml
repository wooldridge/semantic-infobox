x	   Vietnam Affordable Housing&#13;
&amp;#12;Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
A. Summary&#13;
Affordable housing will be instrumental to helping Vietnam achieve its goals for increasing&#13;
productivity and inclusive urban growth. Since Doi Moi, the country has experienced impressive&#13;
economic growth, averaged at 7.4 percent per annum from 1990 to 2008, lowering to an average&#13;
of 6 percent per annum from 2007 to 2013. Strong economic growth has supported a substantial&#13;
reduction in poverty, from 58 percent in 1993 to 17 percent in 20121. Yet, the country has remained&#13;
largely rural, with more than half of its population working in the agricultural sector, which only&#13;
contributed 17 percent of GDP in 20142. In some countries, urbanization has been used as a tool&#13;
to accelerate economic growth and poverty reduction. As Vietnam aims to maintain a high growth&#13;
rate, supporting urbanization, where cities contribute a growing share of jobs and GDP, will be&#13;
an important measure. This structural shift will drive population growth and new demand for&#13;
housing in cities, for which quality and affordable housing options in well-serviced and connected&#13;
settlements will be needed.&#13;
&#13;
There is an opportunity now for government to consolidate and refocus efforts in the housing sector.&#13;
Vietnam has gone through several phases of housing policy. Prior to 1988, the formal housing sector&#13;
was managed through central planning, which shifted to a reliance on market systems following the&#13;
Doi Moi reforms. This has led to tremendous growth in the housing sector, particularly in the high-&#13;
end segment for both the supply and demand sides. Yet, a market-based approach largely has not&#13;
delivered housing solutions accessible to the poor or near-poor. Growth spurred by FDI investment&#13;
and speculation led to significant home price increases in the high-end segment that eventually&#13;
resulted in a real estate bubble from 2009-2012. The 30 trillion stimulus package has helped to&#13;
reorient developers and lenders toward the affordable middle income housing sector with real&#13;
home ownership needs, yet at a high fiscal cost to the government. After these years of crisis, there is&#13;
an opportunity now to enter a new phase of housing policy, which is focused on better management&#13;
of market vulnerabilities, more efficient public spending and affordability for the lowest income.&#13;
&#13;
The 2015 Housing Law sets the framework for reform in the housing sector. Areas of particular&#13;
importance in the Law is support toward self-built housing, the active participation of the private&#13;
sector, addressing the shortage of affordable rental housing as well as high demand for housing from&#13;
low income groups, especially workers in industrial zones of large cities. This report, which includes&#13;
a comprehensive assessment and roadmap for affordable housing in Vietnam, recommends the&#13;
following key messages moving forward:&#13;
&#13;
     1.	Increase Investment: Consolidate and increase housing sector funding in a sustainable way to&#13;
        meet national housing objectives, targeting the lowest two income quintiles and high growth&#13;
        cities, where the need for housing is most urgent.&#13;

&amp;#12;         2.	Prepare Three Flagship Initiatives under an umbrella National Affordable Housing&#13;
            Program: Develop a new generation of interventions in the housing sector and cultivate&#13;
            capable delivery actors, focused on efficient use of public funds and solutions catered to&#13;
            the bottom 40 percent of the population. These include:&#13;
&#13;
            Initiative One. Housing Finance Assistance: Develop specialized housing finance&#13;
            products for formal and informal low-income households and shift to mortgage-linked&#13;
            subsidies to enhance affordability for the middle-class in a more cost-effective way.&#13;
&#13;
            Initiative Two. Affordable Rental Housing: Increase private sector provision of&#13;
            affordable rental housing through a capital subsidy program targeting industrial workers&#13;
            and low income urban residents.&#13;
&#13;
            Initiative Three. Starter Homes: Deliver core housing units that are incrementally&#13;
            expandable for the lowest income households in new urban, peri-urban and rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
         3.	Undertake Two Structural Reforms: To effectively manage the housing sector, undertake&#13;
            two priority reforms, which ensure good coordination, cost recovery and long-term&#13;
            sustainability of policy initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
            Reform One. Institutional Strengthening: Work towards strengthening an over-arching&#13;
            housing and real estate sector coordinating body, to prepare policy and programs, channel&#13;
            subsidies and to support local governments into becoming effective executing agents.&#13;
&#13;
            Reform Two. Land Tax Reform: Make progressive adjustments in the land taxation&#13;
            framework to support local governments with additional local revenues for project funding&#13;
            and to allow better management of land markets.&#13;
&#13;
         4.	Create an Enabling Environment for Affordable Housing: Invest in a suite of activities&#13;
            into the medium-term for strengthening housing sector governance and development&#13;
            of the affordable housing sector. This includes putting in place the building blocks of&#13;
            a functioning housing market, including real estate information systems, a common&#13;
            targeting framework, and strengthening M&amp;E, as well as design of supporting regulatory&#13;
            or administrative reforms and new initiatives in priority action areas.&#13;
&#13;
       Moving forward, design of the market-oriented measures described above will require intensive and&#13;
       careful consultation and engagement with all housing sector actors, particularly the private sector.&#13;
       Private sector will need to play an active role in the early preparation to ensure their participation&#13;
       and commitment that carries through to implementation of policy measures on the financing and&#13;
       supply side.&#13;
&#13;
       B. Sector Assessment&#13;
       Despite economic growth, Vietnam still has a substantial deficit of quality housing. Today,&#13;
       almost 20 percent (approximately 4.8 million households) of Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s 24.2 million households&#13;
       live in poor conditions. Population growth and urbanization have exceeded the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s ability&#13;
       to ensure its citizens have access to safe and affordable housing. The share of the urban population is&#13;
       expected to reach 50 percent by 2040 as Vietnam continues to promote industrialization as a means&#13;
&#13;
xii	   Vietnam Affordable Housing&#13;
&amp;#12;to facilitate economic growth and poverty reduction. This will mean that an estimated 374,000&#13;
additional units are needed in cities annually, with the number of urban households projected to&#13;
increase to 10.1 million in 2020 (from 8.3 million in 2015), as a result of urban population growth&#13;
and a decline in the average household size at 1.1 percent per annum3.&#13;
&#13;
New demand for housing will be concentrated in a few major cities and industrial zones. The two&#13;
largest metropolitan areas, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) will drive urban growth into&#13;
the medium-term. Spatial analysis shows that more than 50 percent of urban land in the country lies&#13;
within the boundaries of these two urban areas, as well as 75 percent of new urban spatial growth. The&#13;
Red River Delta Region (including Hanoi) and the South East Region (including HCMC) account&#13;
for around two-thirds of annual housing demand or an estimated 244,000 out of the 374,000 units.&#13;
&#13;
Current supply has been dominated by self-built solutions. Approximately 75 to 80 percent of units&#13;
are produced by small-scale developers, micro-builders and households themselves. However, low and&#13;
middle income households still face many difficulties in obtaining the necessary resources for a formal&#13;
and decent self-built unit. First, access to formal land for self-built housing is often unaffordable&#13;
due to the costly and lengthy procedures to obtain formal tenure. Secondly, access to finance is a&#13;
constraint to many low income and informally-employed households, due largely to the low level of&#13;
financial inclusion. Technical capacity to ensure quality construction of housing is also a challenge.&#13;
Finally, certain regulatory and administrative requirements push households into informality, such&#13;
as minimum plot sizes (e.g. 50 m2 or more in some cities) and prohibitively costly infrastructure&#13;
requirements. The government has started to increase flexibility for self-builders, taking into account&#13;
sector needs. For example, Decree No. 64/2012/ND-CP allows for exemptions on construction&#13;
permits for small projects, which reflects the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s willingness to support this sector.&#13;
&#13;
The developer-built commercial sector has experienced strong growth, but has been vulnerable to&#13;
cyclical downturns. Following the Doi Moi Reform era, state-owned developers dominated housing&#13;
production until 1998. Since then, a growing number of private developers have entered and become&#13;
active in residential housing. Yet, Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s real estate sector has also experienced three major&#13;
downturns in this period, revealing the weaknesses of the housing system. A volatile market during&#13;
2009-2012 resulted in rising inflation, high interest rates and slowed growth, which deflated the real&#13;
estate bubble. Home prices decreased substantially, particularly in the middle and high-end market,&#13;
leading to a stagnation of housing production, scarcity of liquidity, consolidation of actors and a&#13;
sizable inventory of high-end housing stock needing completion or uptake. Prices for affordable homes&#13;
(priced at below VND16 million/m2) also decreased, but remained relatively stable during this period&#13;
due to continued consumer demand. Unmet market demand, supported by the 30 trillion stimulus&#13;
package, has led to stronger participation by developers in the affordable housing segment, in spite&#13;
of lower margins. As the market stabilizes and investment returns, this interest could be leveraged to&#13;
further increase private sector participation in lower market segments.&#13;
&#13;
Demand for rental housing is high in urban areas and increasing. According to the 2009 Census, rental&#13;
housing makes up around 15 percent of Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s housing stock, or 3.3 million units nationwide.&#13;
Rental housing demand is concentrated in urban areas (up to 26 percent of households in HCMC),&#13;
among migrants (64 percent of migrants in HCMC and Hanoi live in rental housing), youths and low&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3&#13;
 Authorsâ&#128;&#153; calculations based on Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS), 2009 Census&#13;
and 2013 Inter-Censal Survey.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                    A Way Forward         xiii&#13;
&amp;#12;       income households. The need for temporary housing or rental solutions can be expected to increase&#13;
       as Vietnam becomes more urbanized, the population of students and migrant workers rise and the&#13;
       average age of marriage continues to increase, with many young people choosing to settle later in life.&#13;
       Existing affordable rental housing in Vietnam is mainly informal, small-scale and substandard. The&#13;
       low level of formality faced by many tenants has a significant impact on livelihood opportunities and&#13;
       magnifies vulnerability to poverty, particularly for migrants. Despite rising demand, the supply of&#13;
       formal affordable rental housing is limited, due to the low payment capacity of tenants, legal hurdles,&#13;
       and the difficulties for private sector to prepare financially viable projects, which prevents their&#13;
       participation and incentivizes landlords to remain informal.&#13;
&#13;
       Industrial zone workers contribute to a large share of rental housing demand. In Quarter 3 of&#13;
       2014, out of the 15.8 million people who are employed in urban areas, 3.05 million belong to the&#13;
       manufacturing sector, with 2.25 million people working in 295 industrial parks and 15 economic&#13;
       zones across the country4. Among industrial workers, roughly 40 percent are between the ages of 15&#13;
       and 29 and approximately 78 percent, or 1.75 million people, rent their dwellings. It is estimated that&#13;
       formal supply is only sufficient to respond to 10 percent of this rental housing demand, indicating&#13;
       that most people end up renting informally, and there is substantial unmet need in industrial zones&#13;
       for adequate rental and starter home options.&#13;
&#13;
       Despite the need, formal housing solutions are largely not affordable to the low income. Affordability&#13;
       analysis based on income groups indicates that only the top income quintile can afford developer-&#13;
       built commercial units. The 30 trillion stimulus package has extended affordability to middle&#13;
       income households, albeit at a high cost to government, by significantly lowering and fixing interest&#13;
       rates below prevailing market rates. However, as exhibited by Table 1, standard housing units are&#13;
       not affordable for lower-income groups, particularly those below the 40th percentile of household&#13;
       income, as well as informal income or tenure groups.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
       Access to housing finance is a major barrier for increasing affordability. There are large underserved&#13;
       segments of the market that are unable to access housing finance. For example, 68 percent of the&#13;
       labor force have informal income and therefore do not qualify for mortgages. Neither do home-&#13;
       owners with informal tenure and the poor, who have low payment capacity. Innovations in housing&#13;
       finance and lending channels are required to respond to these market needs, which are supported&#13;

&amp;#12;by long-term sources of funds. Furthermore, the real estate downturn in 2009-2012 exposed&#13;
systemic weaknesses in the mortgage sector. Lender underwriting standards are widely varied and&#13;
risk management practices are weak. There is also a need to improve the foreclosure system, develop&#13;
early-indicator tracking tools for the sector and consider counter-cyclical prudential regulations to&#13;
support sustained market stability. These will be important measures to guard against risks through&#13;
market cycles, as growth and investor interest returns to real estate.&#13;
&#13;
Land supply is another key obstacle to affordable housing production. Annually, an estimated 11,500&#13;
hectares of urban land is needed for housing. Formal supply is failing to keep pace with demand,&#13;
which is forcing up prices and reducing affordability. The existing land administration framework is&#13;
complex and inefficient. Key challenges to the delivery of suitable serviced land include: (i) difficulty&#13;
for governments to mobilize vacant or underdeveloped land in cities; (ii) controversy in the Stateâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
land acquisitions and compensation practices; (iii) challenges enforcing and tracking the 20 percent&#13;
land contribution requirement stipulated in Decree 188; (iv) the lack of land value capture tools&#13;
to extract value from new development; and, (v) limited use of integrated land use planning and&#13;
coordination between relevant ministries (i.e. MoC, MoNRE, MoT, MPI).&#13;
&#13;
Land tax rates in Vietnam are currently very low, which contributes to speculation and elevated&#13;
land prices. Land tax only accounts for 2 to 3 percent of total government revenues, due to minimal&#13;
tax rates and below-market valuations prescribed by Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s Committees in the Land Price&#13;
Framework. This significantly limits revenues for providing services, infrastructure and funding for&#13;
other public programs. Adjustments in the land taxation framework is expected to have a significant&#13;
impact on increasing land supply and improving affordability, by reducing incentives for investors&#13;
to hold vacant or underdeveloped land for speculation, thereby lowering land prices.&#13;
&#13;
Existing housing programs have had some positive outcomes, however, most are still ongoing and&#13;
results are unclear. There are almost a dozen housing programs in implementation. They have largely&#13;
been successful at leveraging private sector and reaching a large number of households, notably the&#13;
30 trillion program, the Mekong River Delta flood mitigation program and home improvement&#13;
support to low income rural families. Yet, most programs are designed independently for different&#13;
target groups, using distinct delivery channels that are not coordinated with other efforts in the sector,&#13;
and without clear accounting mechanisms for public expenditure. Several of these programs have also&#13;
struggled to receive the necessary funding for implementation, while others have been implemented&#13;
at high economic cost to the government. Finally, there is a gap in housing policy focus for poor urban&#13;
households. Programs could be made more efficient through consolidating delivery systems and focus&#13;
on developing broad market segments, rather than delivering to independent target groups.&#13;
&#13;
              Box 1 Examples of Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s Government Interventions in Affordable Housing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  30 Trillion Stimulus Package: GoV launched the 30 trillion stimulus package in June 2013 to stimulate the&#13;
  real estate market, while addressing the over-supply of high-end inventories, and reorienting lenders and&#13;
  developers toward real demand from middle and low income consumers. While SBV manages consumer&#13;
  eligibility criteria, loan disbursement and performance on the demand side, MoC is responsible for&#13;
  approving and overseeing projects on the supply side. Although the program has been largely successful at&#13;
  stimulating affordable housing production and lending, aimed to reach an estimated 45,000 households,&#13;
  it struggled initially with slow disbursement and largely benefits the formally-employed middle class at&#13;
  high economic cost to the government. The implicit economic cost of the subsidy for mortgage loans and&#13;
  developer loans is 23.8 percent and 7.1 percent of total capital, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         A Way Forward        xv&#13;
&amp;#12;         Decree 188â&#128;&#153;s 20 percent land contribution requirement: Decree 188â&#128;&#153;s requirement of land contribution to&#13;
         social housing production and provision of complementary development incentives are among the GoVâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
         first efforts to resolve supply-side housing blockages for urban low income segments. Low enforcement&#13;
         and underdeveloped procedures to manage and effectively utilize land reserves at the local level has&#13;
         resulted in developersâ&#128;&#153; reluctance to abide by stringent guidelines and limited supply of land released for&#13;
         social housing through this initiative. This experience demonstrates the need to introduce new procedures&#13;
         by engaging local governments so that they can have input into policy design early and are prepared to&#13;
         implement.&#13;
&#13;
         VUUPâ&#128;&#153;s Housing Upgrade Component: Funding for housing microfinance under the Vietnam Urban&#13;
         Upgrading Program (VUUP) helped to expand and deepen MFI sector activities around micro-loans&#13;
         for housing improvement in urban areas. In conjunction with urban upgrading, USD 15 million was&#13;
         provided to MFIs and community networks to provide preferential credit for home improvement to&#13;
         low income households in HCMC, Hai Phong, Can Tho, and Nam Dinh. Lending in this program reached&#13;
         90,000 households and demonstrated the interest of MFIs to deliver housing microfinance if the right&#13;
         government support is put in place.&#13;
&#13;
         Low income Rural Housing Program: This program targets poor households in rural areas without existing&#13;
         homes. The Vietnam Bank of Social Policy (VBSP) provides low-cost credit for home improvement and&#13;
         incremental construction, as well as basic technical assistance for construction. The Womenâ&#128;&#153;s Union,&#13;
         Farmers Union, and Youth Union are among the community organizations that provide customer&#13;
         interface and operations, from origination and appraisal to disbursement and collection. The program&#13;
         reached 260,587 households by the end of Phase I in 2010 and Phase II aims to reach another 510,700&#13;
         households within 4 years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Difficulties in coordination weaken housing sector governance. The Ministry of Construction (MoC)&#13;
       plays a lead role in regulating and overseeing the housing sector. However, due to the interdisciplinary&#13;
       nature of housing, this role requires convening across almost a dozen separate concerned ministries&#13;
       (including, inter alia, MoC, MoF, MPI, MoNRE, MoT and SBV), which is a difficult task without&#13;
       the necessary tools and support. Many central government bodies act as institutional silos with ad hoc&#13;
       coordination and reporting mechanisms, which limits the ability of MoC to design and deliver cost-&#13;
       effective and integrated housing programs. There is a need to structure a more robust coordination&#13;
       framework, as well as invest further in management information systems in order to improve market&#13;
       information and monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) of the effectiveness of public programs. This&#13;
       will allow the government to more easily measure and improve performance of policy initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
       Fiscal constraints also restrict investment in the housing sector. Though housing was identified as a&#13;
       key development target in the National Socio-Economic Development Plan, there is very little fiscal&#13;
       space to expand budget allocation beyond other priority sectors, for example, education and health.&#13;
       Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s fiscal position has deteriorated since 2006, due to a rise in recurrent expenditures and a&#13;
       drop in government revenues from 25.6 percent of GDP in 2009 to an expected 20.1 percent of GDP&#13;
       in 2015. Public debt has reached above 60 percent of GDP, only slightly below the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s legal&#13;
       limit of 65 percent and the budget deficit has remained consistently above 5 percent of GDP. As a&#13;
       result, there are constraints for the introduction of new programs, a focus on decentralizing resource&#13;
       commitments to local governments and on cost recovery possibilities for public investments.&#13;
&#13;
       Some local governments have prepared innovative housing projects, yet most need support to become&#13;
       more effective in affordable housing provision in their cities. Local governments have the mandate&#13;
       for housing provision, but often do not prioritize housing despite the magnitude of the demand,&#13;
&#13;
xvi	   Vietnam Affordable Housing&#13;
&amp;#12;due to a lack of technical know-how and ability to plan and mobilize resources toward the sector.&#13;
Local Housing Development Funds, which were intended to act as a conduit at the provincial&#13;
level to implement the 2005 Housing Law, have failed to be established in most cities due to lack&#13;
of funding and guidance, and where they have been, have only had limited success. Subsequently,&#13;
government have decided to merge these bodies with the Local Development Investment Funds,&#13;
which have a new provision that allows for investment in public housing programs, yet still no&#13;
guidance on local interventions in the sector. Local governments also depend heavily on central level&#13;
regulatory approval, which can cause delays and restrict innovation in the sector. Nevertheless, there&#13;
has been innovation at the local level, including efforts to pilot land readjustment in the Mekong&#13;
Delta for flood-prone households and Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) between employers and&#13;
local government for mixed-use worker housing in Da Nangâ&#128;&#153;s industrial zones, which provide an&#13;
opportunity for replication and scaling.&#13;
&#13;
The Central Steering Committee (CSC) on Housing and Real Estate Market Policy is an important&#13;
effort toward integration. Headed by the Deputy Prime Minister, this body was established to&#13;
advise the Prime Minister on real estate and housing market interventions. The multi-disciplinary&#13;
working group including all ministries relevant to the sector, as well as the directorates for agricultural&#13;
development, labor federation, and urban management and construction, among others, has the&#13;
mandate to advise and provide inputs into proposed housing programs and also to play a coordinating&#13;
role for respective line ministries, bureaus, and directorates. However, the CSC has yet to possess clearly&#13;
defined mechanisms for coordinating stakeholders, program implementation, and sector oversight.&#13;
&#13;
The Housing Law presents the opportunity for government to consolidate and increase public&#13;
investment in the housing sector. The revised Housing Law, passed by parliament in November 2014&#13;
and effective as of July 2015, provides the legislative framework for government support and reform&#13;
in priority areas for affordable housing. This includes self-built housing, affordable rental housing,&#13;
redevelopment of old public housing blocks, improved sector management, real estate management&#13;
information systems, among other items. The challenge now is to operationalize the 2015 Housing&#13;
Law by building out a set of capable actors, effective delivery systems and initiatives that can be used&#13;
to more effectively manage the housing sector and increase affordability for the lowest income.&#13;
&#13;
C. Roadmap Recommendations&#13;
The Roadmap outlines a strategy to inform and shape the government of Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s interventions&#13;
in the housing sector in the next five years. The primary recommendation is for the government to&#13;
structure a National Affordable Housing Program as a vehicle to realize the objectives of the 2015&#13;
Housing Law. This Program would have three Flagship Initiatives and two Structural Reforms, as&#13;
well as a package of supporting activities to strengthen management and regulation of the housing&#13;
sector and to better target housing support toward the lowest income. The proposed structure of the&#13;
National Affordable Housing Program is shown in Figure 2 and described in the following section.&#13;
&#13;
1. Flagship Initiative: Housing Finance Assistance&#13;
&#13;
The first initiative aims to expand access to housing finance to low income and informal households&#13;
and strengthen the overall lending environment. The main focus is to support development of&#13;
a set of specialized housing finance products to meet the different needs of low income urban&#13;
households, while reducing the marketâ&#128;&#153;s vulnerability to real estate speculation and the variability&#13;
of investment cycles.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                       A Way Forward          xvii&#13;

            Reforms&#13;
                                                      Urban Land Tax Reform&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Firstly, it is recommended to use a more cost-efficient approach to expand access to mortgage finance.&#13;
         This requires restructuring the 30 trillion program by shifting toward a mortgage-linked buy-down&#13;
         subsidy and introducing a broader focus on building the financial sectorâ&#128;&#153;s capacity for lending and&#13;
         managing housing finance risks. Specific activities will include designing and introducing the buy-&#13;
         down subsidy, investigating the feasibility of a secondary mortgage facility to provide a solution to&#13;
         long-term funding for banks, as well as a suite of activities to improve mortgage sector management,&#13;
         such as improved lending standards, risk management tools and monitoring systems. These are&#13;
         described in more detail in the report.&#13;
&#13;
         Secondly, expand the availability of finance for home improvement or incremental expansion with&#13;
         support towards a savings and subsidy-linked housing microfinance product. Please refer to Figure 3&#13;
         for the interaction between actors. In such a program, participating financial institutions will qualify&#13;
         eligible households for a housing micro-loan (e.g. loans up to VND 30 million, for around 3-5 years)&#13;
         that would be linked to a subsidy enhancement provided by government. Credit-worthiness of low&#13;
         income households may be established through a minimum period of savings (e.g. 12 months) or a&#13;
         pre-existing savings or lending history. Construction technical assistance would also be incorporated&#13;
         into the loan to lower costs and improve quality of construction. Home expansion could be used for&#13;
         own-use or for rental purposes, where small landlords will be encouraged to construct an additional&#13;
         room for rental.&#13;
&#13;
         In the medium-term, another specialized housing finance product for development is a savings&#13;
         and subsidy-linked micro-mortgage. This product would target households with informal income&#13;
         for purchase of formal housing units and would also use a savings requirement for participating&#13;
         households (to help financial institutions to qualify people without a credit history or formal&#13;
         employment) and be linked to a government subsidy to enhance affordability for lower-income&#13;
         people. Micro-mortgages could be used in conjunction with the flagship initiative for starter homes.&#13;
&#13;
         2. Flagship Initiative: Affordable Rental Housing&#13;
&#13;
         It is recommended to invest in the development of an affordable rental program, driven by local&#13;
         governments, to increase private sector provision of quality and affordable rental housing in priority&#13;
         areas. This program would initially focus on supply-side support that is complemented by a set of&#13;
         reforms and activities to create an enabling environment for the formal rental market. In time,&#13;
         demand-side assistance can be introduced to assist the poorest and most vulnerable households.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
To incentivize production, government is recommended to structure capital subsidies (e.g. in cash,&#13;
infrastructure or land, where appropriate) in order to engage a set of accredited actors (e.g. investors,&#13;
landlords, NGOs or employers) to provide quality rental housing to target groups. In order to access&#13;
subsidies, rental housing providers must make a commitment to maintain units at affordable levels&#13;
for a set length of time for the target population (e.g. 10 years). Local governments would oversee&#13;
projects, which could include mixed-use and mixed-income elements to support development&#13;
of integrated and well-serviced neighborhoods, as well as the financial viability of projects. The&#13;
initiative can be started with pilots in industrial zones to respond to existing demand, and after&#13;
testing, expanded to address other priority groups in urban areas, including low income households&#13;
(â&#128;&#152;poor listâ&#128;&#153; households and those below the 40th income percentile), students and young families.&#13;
&#13;
To reach the lowest income and most vulnerable households, rental housing vouchers may be needed,&#13;
in order to fill the affordability gap between the monthly payment capacity of the poorest families and&#13;
the rental income required by private sector to ensure adequate returns for the project investment.&#13;
&#13;
3. Flagship Initiative: Starter Homes&#13;
&#13;
The final initiative is focused on a program to support self-built housing with â&#128;&#152;starter homeâ&#128;&#153; core units&#13;
targeted at the lowest-income households, located in well-serviced urban, peri-urban and rural areas.&#13;
Core units are typically one-floor with at least one room of 12 m2 or larger, are move-in ready and can&#13;
be extended incrementally over time by households, according to their changing needs, preferences and&#13;
payment capacity.&#13;
&#13;
Core units allow the lowest income, who are unable to self-provide, to have a formal start in their&#13;
housing career, with basic infrastructure in place. Starter homes mitigate negative externalities that&#13;
arise from completely self-built solutions in slum areas, such as public health issues, and are more&#13;
cost efficient than ex-post neighborhood upgrading.&#13;

      Core units can be developed on a large scale by a private developer, through a cooperative movement,&#13;
      or a mix of both. The â&#128;&#152;starter homeâ&#128;&#153; initiative could involve partnership with an intermediary&#13;
      institution or association (such as MFIs, trade unions, worker unions, womenâ&#128;&#153;s groups), who&#13;
      would play a role in engaging and organizing groups of eligible low income households. Savings and&#13;
      subsidy-linked micro-mortgages can be used for the informally-employed, where households use&#13;
      regular savings to build up a credit-history (e.g. 12 months) to enable them to qualify for housing&#13;
      finance to purchase core house units.&#13;
&#13;
      Local governments would play an important role to identify and develop appropriate land sites for core&#13;
      housing projects (either through land reserved under Decree 188, or other tools, such as land pooling&#13;
      and land readjustment etc.), engaging private sector contractors, and supervising offtake, where units&#13;
      are sold, rented or allocated to eligible households. In time, home-owners may elect to incrementally&#13;
      expand their units through housing microfinance and construction technical assistance.&#13;

&amp;#12;4. Structural Reform: Institutional Strengthening&#13;
&#13;
It is recommended to: (i) develop an over-arching body to carry out sector coordination and&#13;
oversight; and (ii) focus on building capacity of local governments in at least five of Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s high-&#13;
growth cities, to support them to become effective executing agents of national housing initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
An overarching body, hereby referred to as a National Housing Authority (NHA), would act as an&#13;
over-arching coordinating body, across ministries and local governments, to oversee housing sector&#13;
interventions. The NHA need not be a new institution, it could be anchored under a lead ministry,&#13;
determined by GoV, or by establishing a new executive body at a higher level of government, or by&#13;
expanding the mandate and capacity of the existing Central Steering Committee.&#13;
&#13;
Such an agency could have the following specific set of functions:&#13;
&#13;
     - Coordinate and convene public agencies&#13;
     - Carry out policy analysis and development&#13;
     - Channel subsidies and support to local governments&#13;
     - Monitor and evaluate programs&#13;
     - Develop a common targeting framework&#13;
     - Oversee housing and real estate market information systems&#13;
&#13;
The NHA would also engage and support local governments toward preparation and execution&#13;
of the Flagship Initiatives. Local governments play an important role in carrying out local needs&#13;
assessments, identifying target households, facilitating land provision, administering subsidies,&#13;
engaging private sector and reporting back results for the monitoring of programs. By creating&#13;
common delivery systems, clear performance indicators and platforms for training and peer-to-&#13;
peer sharing, central government can support and incentivize local governments to become more&#13;
effective agents in affordable housing provision.&#13;

&amp;#12;        5. Structural Reform: Urban Land Tax&#13;
&#13;
        To build out these housing initiatives in a sustainable way, the government is recommended to consider&#13;
        adjustments in the structure of land taxation.&#13;
&#13;
        It is recommended that, in the short term, steps are taken to progressively increase the LPF so that it is&#13;
        in alignment with the market prices of land, as this can be undertaken within the existing legislation.&#13;
        Secondly, it is recommended that increases in the annual land tax rate or the addition of a levy or&#13;
        property tax5 be considered as part of the review of the implementation of the 2013 Land Law.&#13;
&#13;
        The new structure would raise land tax revenues in a phased and progressive way, to enable local&#13;
        governments to better manage land resources, dampen speculation, raise revenues, and increase land&#13;
        supply for a better functioning market. In order to avoid any adverse effects on the low income, land&#13;
        right use holders may be charged with additional tax increments for multiple and larger land-holdings&#13;
        based on approved land use, whether developed or not.&#13;
&#13;
        With proper implementation, land tax reform would be achieved without any negative consequences&#13;
        to low income households. On the contrary, increased land taxation will reduce incentives for investors&#13;
        to hold idle land and mitigate the inflation of land prices from speculation, thus facilitating affordable&#13;
        housing for the urban poor, and ultimately improving the affordability of new formal housing. Increases&#13;
        in the LPF will also improve the compensation of existing land use right holders whose land is acquired&#13;
        for state-approved development projects.&#13;

                                                                                                 Market&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        5&#13;
         Any fee should be based on the land value (rather than the value of built property) and could be introduced as a&#13;
        surcharge to the land tax, possibly temporarily, in order to finance specific projects (e.g. a betterment levy) or may be&#13;
        considered an option to circumvent the tax rates that are fixed in the Land Law.&#13;

&amp;#12;6. Creating an Enabling Environment for the Affordable Housing Market&#13;
&#13;
Beyond the Flagship Initiatives and Structural Reforms outlined in the proposed National&#13;
Affordable Housing Program, the Roadmap outlines a detailed agenda of supporting regulatory and&#13;
investment activities in six areas of priority action. These will be critical to supporting the success of&#13;
policies and improving management of the housing sector. These are listed below and described in&#13;
the report in more detail.&#13;
&#13;
Housing Finance:&#13;
&#13;
  - Continue to support development of specialized savings and subsidy-linked housing finance&#13;
    products to address the gap in access to housing finance.&#13;
  - Ensure the safety and soundness of the mortgage sector by enhancing prudent lending&#13;
    standards, strengthening monitoring and risk management tools.&#13;
  - Facilitate access to long-term funding by assessing the feasibility of a secondary mortgage&#13;
    facility, in order to deepen the lending capacity of the financial sector.&#13;
  - Develop a framework for financial literacy and borrowersâ&#128;&#153; protection.&#13;
  - Support development of micro-finance regulations.&#13;
&#13;
Access to Land:&#13;
&#13;
  - Build systems to reclaim undeveloped land, which has been allocated to investors, if it is not&#13;
    developed within the specified period.&#13;
  - Introduce land pooling and land readjustment (LPLR) as pilot projects in three cities to&#13;
    improve efficiency and equity of land development and increase land supply.&#13;
  - Design clear bidding frameworks (i.e. Request for Proposals or RFPs) in order to create a&#13;
    more competitive and transparent system for selling and allocating development rights to public&#13;
    land holdings.&#13;
  - Strengthen the implementation guidance of land contribution decrees (e.g. Decree 188)&#13;
    with support to local governments to strengthen enforcement capacity, improve valuations and&#13;
    tracking of land contributions, and systems to release land for social housing programs.&#13;
  - Expand â&#128;&#156;one-stop-shopâ&#128;&#157; model to streamline land-related services and provide local interfaces&#13;
    with district administration.&#13;
  - Replace one-off land use fee with a modest administrative charge to increase incentives for all&#13;
    land holdings and transfers to be registered.&#13;
  - Prepare a coordinating framework, for all land-related functions to improve coordination&#13;
    across involved ministries.&#13;
&#13;
Affordable Rental Housing:&#13;
&#13;
  - Improve market information for the rental sector to increase visibility and understanding of&#13;
    the sector.&#13;
  - Strengthen legislative framework for rental, including landlord-tenant relations, business&#13;
    registration, income tax waivers for rental providers, and introducing more flexibility into rental&#13;
    housing regulations.&#13;
  - Support innovation in rental housing finance e.g. long-term financing for landlords and investors.&#13;
  - Scale the capital-subsidy program to support affordable rental in more priority areas for&#13;
    target groups.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                      A Way Forward          xxiii&#13;
&amp;#12;         - Introduce time-bound rental vouchers to enhance the payment capacity of the lowest income,&#13;
           which could be coupled with supply-side support.&#13;
&#13;
        Self-Built Housing:&#13;
&#13;
         - Expand urban upgrading programs with delivery of infrastructure to under-serviced areas.&#13;
           Upgrade or redevelop in-situ, or voluntarily resettle, as per preferences through community&#13;
           participation.&#13;
         - Scale flagship initiatives for incrementally self-built and core housing.&#13;
&#13;
        Developer-Built Housing:&#13;
&#13;
         - PPPs to improve old housing stock. Develop and implement a model to incent developer&#13;
           participation in redevelopment of public housing blocks (e.g. through development bonuses).&#13;
         - Promote shared tenure models, including condos and coops, with an emphasis on improved&#13;
           Home-Ownersâ&#128;&#153; Associations.&#13;
         - Explore transferable development rights and strengthen mechanisms for payment in lieu of land&#13;
           contributions.&#13;
&#13;
        Housing Sector Governance:&#13;
&#13;
         - Invest in the building blocks of effective governance, including improved management&#13;
           information systems for the housing sector, development of good targeting frameworks and&#13;
           program monitoring and reporting procedures.&#13;
         - Improve regulatory and administrative environment. Assess and standardize administrative&#13;
           processes for land and housing development (e.g. e-systems, simplifying or minimizing steps).&#13;
           Carry out a regulatory audit and make necessary adjustments toward clear and consistent&#13;
           legislation.&#13;

    accounts for approximately 643,000 units,           after satisfying other basic needs (e.g. food,&#13;
    to address overcrowding and substandard             transport), savings and ability to access credit&#13;
    materials.                                          to purchase a property. Housing affordability&#13;

      on the analysis of housing need, demand and&#13;
      affordability are as followed:&#13;
&#13;
      a.	 Low income Q1 and Q2 income segments&#13;
          with no housing, such as migrants and&#13;
          newly-formed families, have the most&#13;
          urgent housing need given their limited&#13;
          savings, income and credit capacity to fully&#13;
          self-provide. These groups will need support&#13;
          for a diverse range of solutions, including&#13;
          rental, rent-to-own and core starter homes,&#13;
          particularly in urban areas.&#13;
      b.	 Low income Q1 and Q2 segments who&#13;
          need housing upgrades will need support&#13;
          to supplement their capacity to self-build&#13;
          through the use of housing microfinance and&#13;
          access to construction technical assistance.&#13;

                                   Box 4.1 Industrial Zones in Vietnam&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Vietnam has had a long-standing goal to transform from an under-developed agricultural country&#13;
  into an industrialized nation. Following the success of industrial parks in Taiwan, Korea and China,&#13;
  Vietnam also adopted this policy to attract foreign investment into export-oriented manufacturing&#13;
  sectors in the late 1990s. This policy was used primarily to accelerate economic growth and shift labor&#13;
  into higher-productivity sectors and has been largely successful. By 2011, industrial manufacturing&#13;
  was the most popular sector for FDI in terms of both registered capital and projects, accounting for&#13;
  7,987 or 58.5 percent of projects and USD 93.05 trillion or 47 percent of total FDI.&#13;
&#13;
  By 2014, Vietnam had developed around 295 industrial parks and 15 economic zones around the&#13;
  country. These industrial zones have been primarily concentrated in peri-urban areas close to Ho Chi&#13;
  Minh City and Hanoi and have prompted large volumes of temporary migrants. There are now an&#13;
  estimated 2.25 million people living and working in industrial zones, of which 75 percent are migrants&#13;
  and 40 percent are between the ages of 15 and 29. Initially these zones were planned exclusively for&#13;
  industry and did not provide space for social services or housing, even though they have attracted a&#13;
  high level of migrants. New regulations on industrial zones now require housing to be incorporated&#13;
  into site plans and there have been 63 social housing projects completed to support industrial&#13;
  workers, primarily dormitories, and several companies have also invested housing for employees.&#13;
  However, creating a healthy environment and ensuring that there is adequate accommodation for&#13;
  workers still remains a major challenge for Vietnam, which will be critical to support the success of its&#13;
  industrialization policy.&#13;

         The Qualitative Assessment of Rental Housing estimated that 80-90% of rental housing contracts were&#13;

      who live in rented housing or shared housing mainly source water from containers (39.6%) and drilled&#13;
      wells (30.6%), which are more expensive than piped sources and are not tested for water quality. 38.3% of&#13;
      rented housing and 50.5% of temporary housing use shared latrines versus 15.8% of households overall.&#13;
      Migrant households are far more likely to have indirect electrical connections (31.5%), as are those in&#13;

                                        Box 4.2 Characteristics of Housing Preferences&#13;
&#13;
       i. Affordability determines how much a person or household can consume. Self-built housing is most&#13;
          flexible to address the affordability question as a household can start with the most basic core unit&#13;
          and incrementally improve the quality and expand the size in line with their savings and earnings&#13;
          capacity as well as housing needs over time.&#13;
       ii. Accessibility is a second key priority as this is critical to income generation opportunities, thus&#13;
          immediately affecting a householdâ&#128;&#153;s social welfare and capacity to pay for housing. This location-&#13;
          based preference includes both the householdâ&#128;&#153;s connectivity to nearby jobs as well as the&#13;
          opportunity to conduct a business within the housing unit successfully. Elements that are&#13;
          important to connectivity would be the distance to business or employment districts, access to&#13;
          public transit, and street frontages for business opportunities.&#13;
       iii. Security is related to the degree of safety for the household away from issues such as burglary or&#13;
          other crimes.&#13;
       iv. Livability indicates access to social amenities, such as education (e.g. schools, kindergartens),&#13;
          health facilities (e.g. clinics, hospitals) and sociocultural facilities (e.g. parks, entertainment).&#13;

Self-built housing can be in a poor condition,         and transfer (e.g., LURC), large minimum lot&#13;

       i. Housing Loans to Informal Sector Households in India&#13;
&#13;
       India provides a valuable example of lenders serving the housing needs of informal sector households.&#13;
       For example, there are two main Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) with a focus on non-salaried&#13;
       consumer segments: DHFL, for middle and low-end segments, and GRUH Finance. GRUH extends&#13;
       loans between USD 1,500 to 150,000, up to 20 years. They are secured both by mortgages and&#13;
       personal guarantees, with LTVs not in excess of 65 percent. Borrowers are existing customers with&#13;

 trades in specific areas. It has developed an internal scoring model on which interest rate scales are&#13;
 based. The credit performance of the GRUH portfolio is very good, with the NPL rate falling to 0.32&#13;
 percent in FY 2013.&#13;

 FNA is a public provident fund mainly covering severance compensation for salaried employees,&#13;
 funded by mandatory savings. FNA also extends housing loans to its affiliates. In 2007, FNA opened&#13;
 its operation to non-salaried households through a voluntary savings plan that entitles them to&#13;
 apply for a housing loan. Applications can be made after a minimum of 12 months and once the&#13;
 savings amount represents the equivalent of one month of income. Stated incomes are compared to&#13;
 household surveys conducted every year by the Colombian Bureau of Statistics, and verified during&#13;
 field visits. To assess applicantsâ&#128;&#153; creditworthiness, FNA looks at credit history if available, and applies&#13;
 an internal scoring model. Housing loans are secured by mortgages. The NPL rate inthis program is&#13;
 lower (5 percent in 2012) than other FNA loans.&#13;

&#13;
       In Morocco, the government set up a specific guarantee fund, FOGARIM that provides partial credit&#13;
       guarantees on mortgage loans extended to households earning low and irregular incomes. The main&#13;
       eligibility conditions are the existence of a first rank mortgage, a monthly repayment charge below&#13;
       a certain ceiling (currently USD 180, and USD 100 in the case of relocated slum dwellers), which is a&#13;
       proxy for a limit on home prices and incomes that are difficult to verify. Lenders can submit claims&#13;
       after 9-months in arrears, and once the foreclosure process has been initiated. The guarantee covers&#13;
       up to 70 percent of the loss, and the premiums range from 0.25 to 0.50 percent per annum, depending&#13;
       on the LTV. FOGARIM supported 115,000 loans since 2004, or about 20 percent of all mortgagesin&#13;
       Morocco, while keeping NPLs at a reasonable rate in spite ofthe risk of the targeted segment.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
           The potential for revenue mobilization through Land Value Taxation (LVT) is significant: for example, in&#13;
           Australia, LVT accounts for 100 percent of local tax revenues (Dye and England, 2010). LVT shifts a share of&#13;
           land value from the land use rights holder to the public sector, thereby aiding in the control of land prices&#13;
           and tempering of speculation. For example, a reasonable tax rate of between 2 and 4 percent captures&#13;
           between 25 and 40 percent of the land value68. For its wide-ranging positive impact, the mission team&#13;
           recommends that serious consideration be given to deepening value capture options in Vietnam.&#13;

         The LPLR workshop in Vietnam in 2014 brought experts from a India, Thailand, Korea, Australia and&#13;

         For example, the Town Planning and Urban Development Act in Gujarat, India statutorily define Town&#13;
      Planning Schemes, whichallow exactions to reach up to 50 percent forroads (15%), parks (5%), amenities&#13;
      (5%), affordable housing (10%), and additional land for auctions for revenue mobilization (15%). The latter&#13;
      also provide the basis for market-based land valuation.&#13;
      73&#13;
         In the case of providing a portion of land to infrastructure developers, similarly to the Land For&#13;
      Infrastructure mechanism, it is important to ensure that the infrastructure developer is selected on a&#13;
      competitive basis. For example, the developer willing to build the infrastructure in exchange for the lowest-&#13;
      value land portion would receive the contract. In addition, land would only be allocated based on output,&#13;
      for example according to a predefined drawdown, ensuring the completion of all works.&#13;

     i. The City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) in India, was established in 1971&#13;
     as a parastatal organization to develop Navi Mumbai to accommodate over 2 million people75. By&#13;
     selling land rights adjacent to and in developments at major transport nodes, CIDCO was able to&#13;
     cover the costs of major road, rail and public utilities provision. The application of LPLR proposals,&#13;
     known as Town Planning Schemes, also enabled the city to grow to its intended population on a&#13;
     largely self-financed basis.&#13;
&#13;
     ii. China Experience. Perhaps the broadest and most comprehensive application of value capture&#13;
     is in China, where municipalities buy adjacent agricultural land from farmers at agricultural use&#13;
     prices, service it with infrastructure, and sell it to developers as urban land with permits for urban&#13;
     development. The difference in price between the landâ&#128;&#153;s urban value and its agricultural value&#13;
     accrues to the municipality, provides a large share of local revenues, and pays for the installed&#13;
     infrastructure76.&#13;

       land administration agencies to capture a reasonable proportion of the added value generated by&#13;
       state action for allocation in the public interest, including:&#13;
       - Land Pooling and Land Readjustment to finance pro-active inclusive urbanization&#13;
       - Betterment charges to recover public investments in technical and social infrastructure&#13;

&amp;#12;              Box 10.5 International Experiencein Supply-Side Rental Housing Programs&#13;
 	&#13;
 There is extensive experience over the past century of public investment in rental housing programs.&#13;
 Although an argument can be made for keeping land and housing assets in public ownership to&#13;
 ensure that there is space in the city for the most vulnerable, such an approach is not easily scalable&#13;
 and is insufficient to respond to the magnitudeof the demand. Increasingly, governments are shifting&#13;
 toward the use of more efficient instruments, such as land-use controls and targetedsubsidies to&#13;
 engage and leverage private sector investment and expertise in low-cost rental housing production&#13;
 and operations.&#13;
&#13;
 i. South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s Social Housing Program. In 2004, South Africa began to develop a sophisticated&#13;
 social rental housing program. A new entity, the Social Housing Regulatory Authority (SHRA) was&#13;
 created to design regulations, accredit Social Housing Institutions (SHIs), administer grants and&#13;
 support development of the sector.SHRA offers two types of subsidies, the Restructuring Capital&#13;
 Grant for specific projects, and the Institutional Subsidy direct to qualified SHIs. The SHRA, along&#13;
 with the National Association of Social Housing Organizations (NASHO), and the South Africa Local&#13;
 Government Authority (SALGA) work together on capacity-building of SHIs and local governments,&#13;
 as well as undertaking market studies to support development of the rental housing sector78.&#13;
&#13;
 ii. Subsidized Rental Housing in the United States. The U.S. has a long history of investment in&#13;
 affordable rental housing. From 1935-1970, large-scale rental projects were built and managed&#13;
 entirely by public sector. Poor location choices (adverse selection of land use alternatives), clustering&#13;
 of the urban poor (â&#128;&#152;income concentrationâ&#128;&#153;), and untrained public-entity owner/ managers led to&#13;
 severe social and health issues in public housing. From 1970-2015, all new US affordable rental&#13;
 housing has been via PPPs with the private sector (for-profit and non-profit), principally through an&#13;
 investor-targeted capital subsidy tied to long-term affordable use. The dominant resource today is&#13;
 the Low income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), plus soft-debt funding via HOME or state-level housing&#13;
 production initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
 - The LIHTC provides tax credits to private investors in return for equity investments in privately-&#13;
   owned rental housing developments with restricted rents (often set below 18 percent of the&#13;
   median household income). This program has been active since the late 1980s and produces&#13;
   between 60,000 and 100,000 units per year.&#13;
 - The HOME program is a housing block grant to city, county and state â&#128;&#156;participating jurisdictionsâ&#128;&#157;.&#13;
   Cities can choose how to use funds, though most use a substantial portion of the grant for rental&#13;
   housing production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

        Rental price     A large number of voucher holders could push up rent prices. This could also occur where&#13;
        inflation        landlords artificially inflate rental prices to the maximum allowable level of the program. In order to&#13;
                         mitigate this risk, in-depth assessments of the local market should be carried out in order to design&#13;
                         a voucher that minimizes distortions. Vouchers could also be rolled out incrementally in order to&#13;
                         first test the market impact.&#13;
&#13;
        Limited supply There may also be reluctance by landlords to rent to low income households that qualify for&#13;
        of rental units vouchers if the administrative steps are too complex, or the government becomes involved (i.e.&#13;
                        rent must be reported), and upon non-renewal of the voucher the landlord would have to find&#13;
                        another tenant. The voucher program should be designed with engagement and input from&#13;
                        potential landlords to ensure that it supports maximum participation.&#13;
&#13;
        Beneficiary      If the voucher is means-tested or means-adjusted, perverse incentives arise where recipients are&#13;
        reliance on      penalized for earning more money, marrying (and adding an income), or other self-improving&#13;
        program          activities. A flat-subsidy is recommended to avoid these issues and also due to the difficulty to&#13;
                         reliably measure household income in Vietnam.There should also be efforts to coordinate voucher&#13;
                         eligibility with other livelihood and savings programs, so that beneficiaries have an exit strategy.&#13;
&#13;
                         Administering 1-on-1 landlord-tenant arrangements is management-intensive; many steps are&#13;
        Poor program     involved. There is a risk that substandard units or households with incomes above the maximum&#13;
        administration   threshold are allowed to participate, or that local governments do not have sufficient resources&#13;
        by local         to properly manage the program. Local governments need to be trained, capable, transparent,&#13;
        governments      and reliable in identifying qualifying households and rental units for the program. Only those local&#13;
                         governments that comply with these minimum standards will be able to participate.&#13;

&amp;#12;                        Box 10.6 International Experiencesin Rental Housing Vouchers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Rental assistance schemes are becoming increasingly common in countries around the world.&#13;
     These include the Housing Choice Voucher Program in the US, the housing benefit in the UK, the&#13;
     Commonwealth Rental Assistance (CRA) program in Australia, as well as rental assistance to low&#13;
     income households and students in Netherlands and France, and many others. These international&#13;
     examples show that there are a number of options in the design of a rental housing voucher program,&#13;
     based on overall objectives. For example, use of a flat subsidy structure can avoid complexities of&#13;
     measuring incomes79 and the negative incentives on income that result from an income-based&#13;
     subsidy80. Also, it should be decided whether housing subsidies can be stacked or not81, whether&#13;
     vouchers are a universal right or limited in number on a first-come, first-served or waiting list&#13;
     basis82. Also, rental assistance programs are often integrated with other social support and income&#13;
     generation activities to better leverage support to help households out of poverty.&#13;
&#13;
     i. The U.S. Housing Choice Voucher Program. The U.S. has a tenant-based rental assistance&#13;
     program administered by the local Public Housing Authorities. Households contribute 30 percent&#13;
     of their income toward rent, and a voucher is paid to the landlord by the federal government up&#13;
     to a â&#128;&#152;fair market rentâ&#128;&#153; (FMR). The FMR is based on a percentile of market rents in the local housing&#13;
     market as determined by periodic survey. Target households must be poor (income 50% or less of&#13;
     area median income, adjusted for family size), and they must use the voucher (find and rent a flat)&#13;
     within 60 days of receipt, or they lose it. In 2010, the federal government provided over $50.2 billion&#13;
     in housing assistance to over 2.2 million households.&#13;
&#13;
     ii. Chileâ&#128;&#153;s Rental Housing Subsidy. Introduced in 2013, Chileâ&#128;&#153;s rental housing subsidy is aimed at&#13;
     low- and moderate-income young families. The Ministryâ&#128;&#153;s 15 regional offices carry out application,&#13;
     enrollment and housing inspections. Administration of the rental subsidy relies heavily on private&#13;
     banks. Chile uses a flat-rate, time-limited subsidy that offers a degree of administrative simplicity&#13;
     and payment flexibility for tenants facing income volatility. There is a considerable amount of&#13;
     flexibility built into the program â&#128;&#147; landlords agree on terms and tenants can miss a payment three&#13;
     times during their tenure before eviction proceedings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10.3.C. Other Market-Making Measures to                   improving market information, supporting&#13;
Support Affordable Rental Housing                         development of suitable financial products and&#13;

revision of the legal and taxation framework,             rental include the following:&#13;
&#13;
79&#13;
   In the UK, the rental subsidy program is considered complex and difficult to both understand and&#13;
administer. The complexity of the calculation of the rate of rental subsidy leads to the occurrence of errors&#13;
in the administrative process, resulting in over-payment (Â£840 million in 1997/98) and delays in payment.&#13;
The US is similar to that of the UK. HUD estimates that there is an overpayment of US$2 billion (HK$15.6&#13;
billion) for all housing assistance each year because of incorrect rental calculations.&#13;
80&#13;
   In the U.S., households must pay 30% of their income, which acts like an income surtax, and incentivizes&#13;
them to avoid formal employment.&#13;
81&#13;
   In Australia, the CRA is exclusive of other forms of social housing assistance (i.e. public housing tenants&#13;
are not eligible). In the US, and particularly the UK, there is stacking of rental demand and supply-side&#13;
assistance in order to reduce rents to more affordable levels. In the UK, this is also used to provide the&#13;
cash flows necessary to secure private financing of capital loans for new social housing development.&#13;
Accordingly, there is a symbiotic relationship between rental assistance and separate supply programs.&#13;
82&#13;
   In Australia, France, Netherlands and the UK, the rental housing benefit programs are a means-tested&#13;
universal entitlement and thus broadly subscribed by low income households. In the US, roughly 1 in 4 eligible&#13;
households receives assistance, and the average time on a waiting list is many months, often many years.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     Thailand has had a successful experience in providing long-term credit for rental housing production&#13;
     via the Government Housing Bank (GHB). In Thailand, the GHB encourages small landlords that own&#13;
     land to construct low-cost rental apartments with very affordable loans. GHB provides up to 100&#13;
     percent of total construction cost with long repayment periods of up to 15 years. This compares to&#13;
     an average 5-7 year repayment period across other lenders.Rent for GHB-supported apartments is&#13;
     limited to between Bt2000 to 4000 per month (VND 1.3 â&#128;&#147; 2.6 million). Currently, more than 8,000&#13;
     landlords have developed rental apartments and rental housing loans outstanding have grown&#13;
     steadily from USD 489 million in 2006 to USD 2.1 billion in 2011 (an average increase of about 34&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
       Sites and services and incremental housing programs at suitable locations and with cross-subsidies&#13;
       between different land uses are considered an international best practice. Davidson &amp; Payne (2000)&#13;
       and Caminos &amp; Goethert (1978) provide excellent textbooks on the matter. Governments, with&#13;
       support of bilateral and international agencies, have facilitated the development of many million&#13;
       housing units worldwide:&#13;
&#13;
       i. The Egyptian case of â&#128;&#152;Build Your Own Homeâ&#128;&#153; demonstrates a process for incremental expansion&#13;
       into multi-story homes, to address high land costs.This is made possibly through a clear incentive&#13;
       framework, allocating subsidies based on a timely construction process and vertical growth of the&#13;
       house. The allocation of appropriate land and physical planning of the districts are the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
       core responsibilities, including the arrangement of the plots and the provision of infrastructure and&#13;
       services â&#128;&#147; such as access to water, electricity and sanitation. Successful applicants receive a plot for&#13;
       self-development after a down-payment of 10 percent. The rest is financed over a period of seven&#13;
       years. To promote timely construction, beneficiaries are exempt from repaying any outstanding&#13;
       installments, once the three-floor house is completed and externally finished. In addition, the&#13;
       government subsidizes the construction of the ground floor unit in order to make it easier for the&#13;
       household to move in, and to speed up the construction process. This approach may be suitable for&#13;
       middle income households.&#13;
&#13;
       ii. The Ciudad BachuÃ© incremental housing project in BogotÃ¡, Colombia provides walk-up&#13;
       blocks with expandable starter apartments. Ground floor maisonettes, sometimes with a fill-in&#13;
       mezzanine, are expanded horizontally. Upper floor apartments expand vertically on the rooftop.&#13;
       The structural core is designed to support up to 5 floors, which is enforced through collective&#13;
       action. The multi-story buildings and improved finishings provide an attractive modern image for&#13;
       a neighborhood. This approach could be adapted in locations with high land cost. In addition,&#13;
       the project provides single-story starter core row houses on narrow lanes, which are expanded&#13;
       vertically. This approach may be suitable for areas with low and medium land costs. Finally, the&#13;
       different characteristics of the stacked maisonettes and row houses suggest combining the two&#13;
       approaches on a single site, differentiating between locations with higher and lower land values, for&#13;
       example on larger access roads and smaller side lanes.&#13;
&#13;
       iii. PREVI in Lima, Peru, is a famous international architecture competition facilitated by the&#13;
       government in collaboration with the UNDP: the competition sourced solutions from national and&#13;
       international experts for designing high-density, incrementally expandable starter homes. The&#13;

     competition winner entries were later constructed, providing incremental housing for the middle&#13;
     class. Such an approach could be used to find innovative solutions.&#13;
&#13;
     v. The case of Pekine in Dakar, Senegal validated the incremental concept by the fact that for every&#13;
     $1 of public funds, some $8.2 of private funds had been invested in housing in the neighborhood&#13;
     within approximately 5 years. However, the project also illustrates the risk that too high standards&#13;
     may lead to rapid gentrification through sale to higher income households.&#13;

           beneficiaries establish a savings and credit history. Building on this history, residents are eligible to a&#13;

           optimal, incremental way. The program is complemented through enhancement of tenure security&#13;
           through a no-eviction guarantee, enabling the delivery of microfinance. The fact that no formal&#13;
           tenure is given also reduces the likelihood that better-off households capture subsidies (see on&#13;
           downzoning below). This case is a suitable example that, together with Vietnamese experiences such&#13;
           as VUUP, could inform the scaling up of a national urban poverty reduction and home improvement&#13;
           program.&#13;
&#13;
           ii. Baan Mankong Upgrading Program, Thailand is a good example of a community-government&#13;
           partnership, which channeled government funds, infrastructure subsidies and soft housing loans&#13;
           directly to the poor who then jointly design and execute improvements to their homes, environment&#13;
           and basic services while managing the budget themselves. In 2003, the Thai Government announced&#13;
           an ambitious policy to address the housing needs of the urban poor,as part of this program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      89&#13;
        At present, VUUP loans are mainly VND 15 million. However, loan sizes may increase if reaching out to&#13;
      Q2 households.&#13;

       A famous reference for a participatory framework is the Million Housing Program in Sri Lanka&#13;
       based on Community Action Planning (Hamdi &amp; Goethert, 1997). The program became possible&#13;
       through national leadership and international cooperation, including the World Bank and&#13;
       leading international academic institutions (MIT, UCL) that provided the technical assistance. The&#13;
       community-driven development framework was anchored in national law and regulations, based&#13;
       on the strategy developed by national policy makers and international experts and an evolution of&#13;
       lessons from initial pilot projects and replication and scale up. The Community Action Planning and&#13;
       variations thereof are used by UN-Habitat, the Cities Alliance, the Asian Coalition for Community&#13;

&#13;
           i. In Turkey,TOKI, a state-owned enterprise (SOE), is a PPP co-developer of middle income&#13;
           housing. Over the last 15 years, TOKI91, the National Housing Development Administration, has&#13;
           emerged as the principal driver of housing development and urban renewal in the Republic of&#13;
           Turkey. With consolidated powers including rights to all state-owned land, the power to override&#13;
           local zoning and impose new zoning, and the power of eminent domain, TOKI has established&#13;
           itself as a national developer or co-developer of housing, either directly (by hiring general&#13;
           contractors) or indirectly (via individual PPP joint ventures) whereby the resulting housing is&#13;
           typically a mixture of income levels, tenure options, and price points. As a result of this, TOKI is&#13;
           self-financing and has been responsible for supply of more than 640,000 homes created over the&#13;
           last 15 years92.&#13;
&#13;
           ii. Singapore: Employer-assisted housing and provident funds. A â&#128;&#152;provident fundâ&#128;&#153; is a&#13;
           form of mandatory savings, deducted directly from the payroll of formally employed workers,&#13;
           that is used in later life for life needs: education, health care, retirement income, or housing.&#13;
           Singaporeâ&#128;&#153;s Central Provident fund (CPF) was begun in 1955 under British colonial rule and&#13;
           continues today; due to its large contributions (16% from the employer on top of salary, 20%&#13;
           from the employee), it has accumulated enormous capital sums, which it allocates among four&#13;
           accounts, one of which (the Ordinary Account) can be tapped for housing loans. The housing&#13;
           loans, in turn, are mainly used to buy new or existing flats developed by Singaporeâ&#128;&#153;s state-owned&#13;
           developer/ regulator, the Housing and Development Board (HDB; http://www.hdb.gov.sg/). In&#13;
           general, pries at both purchase and eventual sale are controlled and managed by the HDB, which&#13;
           acts as a monopsony (universal buyer) across the vast majority of all Singaporean housing. The&#13;
           system works extremely well in Singapore, in part because that is an island city-state which&#13;
           had an uninterrupted many decades of authoritarian-democratic rule coinciding with rising&#13;
           economic prosperity. Other countries often use employer-based provident funds, particularly&#13;
           where there are large employers who face challenges of employee retention and find lending on&#13;
           housing a good means of building employee loyalty93.&#13;

Strategic Context. Existing measures around               of delivering on Inclusionary Zoning (IZ)&#13;
payments in lieu of the social housing                    promises â&#128;&#152;in kindâ&#128;&#153; (i.e. with land contributions&#13;
requirement, as outlined in Decree 188/2013,              or affordable housing actually produced),&#13;
provides an alternative to developers who prefer          introduce alternative mechanisms fordevelopers&#13;
not to participate in social housing production.          to make contributions, either by making a&#13;
Local governments will need to establish                  stipulated cash payment (e.g. per apartment or&#13;
mechanisms around receipt, management, and                square meter of IZ land that would otherwise be&#13;
distribution of linkage payments. The model               required) or by buying a TDR from a successful&#13;

                Box 10.12 Examples of Development Right Incentives for Social Housing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Linkage payments from commercial developers in lieu of IZ requirements. For example, in a development&#13;
 of 100 flats, a developer would ordinarily be expected to deliver land that would support 20 percent, or&#13;
 20 flats, at, for easy demonstration, 50 mÂ² per flat, or 1,000 mÂ² of â&#128;&#152;buildable FARâ&#128;&#153;. A linkage payment of,&#13;
 for example, VND 1 million per mÂ², would amount to VND 1 billion of linkage payments, to be paid in&#13;
 installments starting at groundbreaking and ending at completion. The accumulative linkage payments&#13;
 would go toward funding the cityâ&#128;&#153;s or provinceâ&#128;&#153;s affordable housing development. This would replace&#13;
 the current stipulation under Decree 188/2013 where developers are able to make a contribution&#13;
 equal to the land price framework value of the required 20 percent land contribution in lieu of on-site&#13;
 development. The GoV might also consider limiting linkage payment only to semi-urban and peri-urban&#13;
 sites, while requiring on-site affordable housing delivery for all centrally located projects.&#13;
&#13;
 Transferrable development rights (TDRs) to commercial developers from affordable housing&#13;
 production. For demonstration purposes, a TDR model would have the GoV implementing TDRs&#13;
 at a â&#128;&#152;three-quarterâ&#128;&#153; (Â¾) rule: e.g. for each 4 mÂ² of affordable housing built by a qualified entity (QE)&#13;
 (and approved as affordable housing by the locality), the QE is issued a â&#128;&#152;Transferable Development&#13;

           Right Certificateâ&#128;&#153; for 3 mÂ². Now the developer in the preceding commercial 100-flat properties needs&#13;
           1,000 mÂ² of TDR Certificates, so it has to find a QE that has developed at least 1,333 mÂ² (1,000 Ã· Â¾) of&#13;
           approved affordable housing. The market developer buys that certificate from the QE, for cash, at&#13;
           whatever price they agree upon94. The cash flow generated by the sales of TDR by the QE would qualify&#13;
           toward funding the QEâ&#128;&#153;s next affordable housing project.&#13;

&#13;
      Currently, FAR is at 5.0 for residential                  for exemption allowances that are adjusted&#13;

                            Box 10.13 International Examples of Development Right Incentives&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           i. Transferable Development Rights (TDRs) in India. In India, particularly the major cities (e.g.&#13;
           Mumbai, Delhi), well-located downtown parcels can become extremely valuable if they are allowed&#13;
           an increase in FAR. The government instituted aTDR scheme in Mumbai where, as described in Box&#13;
           10.12, there are Â¾ contributions. Hence, each 4 mÂ² of affordable housing built by suitable developers&#13;
           (usually non-profits) yields a TDR Certificate for 3 mÂ² of increased FAR elsewhere in the city. The TDR&#13;
           market in Mumbai has existed for well over a decade, with prices rising and falling with changes in&#13;
           the cityâ&#128;&#153;s economy and thereal estate development market.&#13;
&#13;
           ii. Linkage payments95, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Since 2000, under a series of decrees&#13;
           (executive orders96) issued by the long-serving mayor of Boston, developers seeking city approval&#13;
           for any scheme were and are required either (a) to include a stipulated percentage of affordable&#13;
           housing (i.e. mandatory IZ) or (b) to â&#128;&#152;buy their way out of the requirementâ&#128;&#153; by making a payment&#13;
           equal to so much per IZ apartment not produced; the figure started at $52,000 per apartment in&#13;
           2000 and is now $200,000 per apartment. Bostonâ&#128;&#153;s linkage payment model has worked in that (a)&#13;
           it is mandatory, because in practice all zoning in the city of Boston is controlled by a single city&#13;
           agency, the Boston Redevelopment authority (BRA), and (b) throughout the relevant period, the City&#13;
           of Boston has always been an attractive place to develop high-density downtown property (office,&#13;
           hotel, or residential).&#13;
&#13;
           iii. Housing Overlay Zones, California, USA. In a Housing Overlay Zone (HOZ), a locality defines a&#13;
           target area (an aging downtown, say, or along the path of a proposed new public transportation&#13;
           network), in which new â&#128;&#152;voluntaryâ&#128;&#153; zoning/ development/ density rules are available, at the property&#13;
           ownerâ&#128;&#153;s election; thus the existing zoning remains in place but the owner (or a developer) may elect&#13;
           the HOZ optional zoning for any property that also meets affordability targets (e.g. 30% affordable&#13;
           instead of 20%). HOZs often include greater FAR, higher height limits, fast-track permitting, and other&#13;
           exemptions or incentives. HOZs have become popular in California as they enable a progressive&#13;
           city council/ mayor to work with the business community on strategically targeted higher-density&#13;
           growth, without requiring rezoning or changes in the cityâ&#128;&#153;s zoning laws.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      94&#13;
         In Mumbai, the market price for TDRs fluctuates with supply and demand.&#13;
      95&#13;
         Some other US cities have also used similar linkage payments or impact fees.&#13;

   on development and construction permits                    HOAs in more detail or provide support&#13;

&amp;#12;                   Box 10.14 Urban Renewal Areas and Redevelopment Authorities (RDAs) in the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Starting in the 1950s, older urban cores in American cities experienced blight, as higher-end&#13;
           households moved to the newly expanding suburbs, leaving the urban core to be re-occupied by&#13;
           rural-to-urban immigrants of much lower income. Many of these neighborhoods saw disinvestment,&#13;
           so the cities created urban renewal authorities (URAs) that became development arms of city&#13;
           government, with the broad power to acquire parcels via eminent domain (expropriation) or&#13;
           foreclosure of real estate tax liens97, to rezone or upzone land, and to convey the property to private&#13;
           developers for revitalization efforts. Several such authorities persist today in cities such as Boston&#13;
           and San Francisco98, and have become the critical urban-planning nexus for city government.&#13;
           Additionally, many jurisdictions have adopted a model of redevelopment areas (RDAs) that&#13;
           may use tax increment financing (TIF); in these models, the municipality designates an area for&#13;
           redevelopment, then commits to use a stipulated portion of the increase in real estate taxes in that&#13;
           area derived from rising property values as a dedicated source of subsidy for affordable housing,&#13;
           as one example. The rising revenue stream can in turn be financed in the capital markets, so that&#13;
           the municipality has up-front cash to fund its portion of urban renewal infrastructure that attracts&#13;
           employers and jobs. The model has been widely used throughout the US.&#13;

      does not pay the real estate tax arrearage, then the locality may foreclose and seize the property (land). These&#13;
      are called â&#128;&#152;in rem foreclosuresâ&#128;&#153;. This is apowerful tool necessary for the recapture of blighted or abandoned&#13;
      parcels or properties.&#13;

 i. Egypt: Social Housing Fund. With a post-revolution focus on affordable housing, Egypt&#13;
 established the Social Housing Fund (SHF) within the Ministry of Housing, Utilities and Urban&#13;
 Development in 2014. The SHF was created as a consolidation of several entities that come under&#13;
 theMinistry to transform the housing sector, improve the housing conditions of the underserved low&#13;
 income population (below 40th percentile of the income distribution) and fulfill the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
 commitment to deliver one million homes for low income households. SHF is charged with&#13;
 designing housing laws and regulations, social housing programs, providing oversight for their&#13;
 implementation in consultation with relevant housing entities, and managing financial resources&#13;

           ii. Morocco. Al Omrane. Morocco consolidated its housing sector in 2003, after insecurity in bidonvilles&#13;
           (slums) prompted King Hassan to establish a National Urban Strategy. Under the broad direction of&#13;
           Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s Ministry of Housing, the NUS specifically sought to prevent or alleviate the proliferation&#13;
           and expansion of informal settlements through new affordable housing production, mainly via&#13;
           PPPs. In addition to the MoH, Morocco in 2004 established Al Omrane Group99, as a consolidation&#13;
           of over a dozen public construction companies, to act as the main government entity to implement&#13;
           housingprograms and coordinate a number of government entities. With 14 subsidiaries regionally, Al&#13;
           Omrane implements four main programs: the Social Housing Program (via PPPs), Villes sans Bidonvilles&#13;
           (â&#128;&#152;Cities without Slumsâ&#128;&#153;) for slum upgrading. A program for very low income housing (Logements a&#13;
           Faibles Valeur Immobiliere Totale, FVIT), and the development of new towns.&#13;

 Established in 2004 as a resolution by the Thai Cabinet, the REIC is a part of the Government Housing&#13;
 Bank though directed by its independent Board of Directors. The REIC missions are to (i) become the&#13;
 Real Estate Industryâ&#128;&#153;s consultant center and knowledge base, (ii) develop housing and real estate&#13;
 research, analysis and forecasting capabilities, (iii) build tools and indicators that reliably forecast&#13;
 the Thai property marketâ&#128;&#153;s demand, supply and price levels and (iv) disseminate relevant real estate&#13;
 information to both the public and private sectors. The REIC is funded primarily by the Thai Ministry&#13;
 of Finance (through the Government Housing Bank), although over the last several years, around10&#13;
 percent of its budget has come from fees derived from services it provides to the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
 The REIC collects data from three key sources:&#13;
&#13;
 -	 Government Ministries (Department of Land, Bank of Thailand - the Central Bank, Ministry of Public&#13;
    Works, Ministry of Urban Planning, Bangkok Metro Public Company Ltd., National Statistics Office,&#13;
    National Housing Development Board, Legal Execution Department for foreclosure data);&#13;
 -	 Primary housing starts and housing completion data from key developers;&#13;
 -	 Quarterly consumer survey conducted across the 77 provinces outsourced by external research&#13;
    agencies.&#13;
&#13;
 The REIC publishes a real estate annual report that includes data relating to home sales, housing&#13;
 starts, land allotment permits, building permits, housing transfers, housing completions, housing&#13;
 mortgages, a housing developer sentiment index and a condominium price index.&#13;

       b.	 Conduct a â&#128;&#152;regulatory and administrative&#13;
           auditâ&#128;&#153; and introduce reforms to streamline&#13;
           procedures and increase flexibility. Launch&#13;
           a study that engages local governments,&#13;
           households and private sector to identify&#13;
           the key blockages in affordable housing&#13;
           delivery. A regulatory audit would identify&#13;
           the costs associated with regulations on&#13;
           housing construction and consumption,&#13;
           with the aim to minimize these and enhance&#13;
           affordability for lower income segments. The&#13;
           result would be a suite of reforms to simplify&#13;
           administrative steps, reduce time delays and&#13;
           costs, where possible.&#13;

       c.	 Create a platform for local governments for&#13;
           peer-to-peer knowledge sharing. GoV could&#13;
           create a collaborative environment where&#13;
           local governments can share best practices&#13;
           and lessons around urban development and&#13;
           affordable housing development. This can be&#13;

       Fund (HEPRF), and social workers. From              across the city. Throughout the process, the&#13;

       The projectâ&#128;&#153;s main challenges occurred after&#13;
       residents began living in the resettlement&#13;
       apartment blocks. Geographical relocation and&#13;
       formal vertical living caused many households&#13;
       to lose their informal jobs as peddlers and&#13;
       home-based workers. The savings groups were&#13;
       hardly maintained, and residents were not&#13;
       effectively educated about microfinance. Loss&#13;
       in employment and failed savings schemes led&#13;

            Vietnam - Affordable housing : a way forward
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Affordable housing will be instrumental
            to helping Vietnam achieve its goals for increasing
            productivity and inclusive urban growth. Since Doi Moi, the
            country has experienced impressive economic growth, averaged
            at 7.4 percent per annum from 1990 to 2008, lowering to an
            average of 6 percent per annum from 2007 to 2013. Strong
            economic growth has supported a substantial reduction in
            poverty, from 58 percent in 1993 to 17 percent in 20121.
            Yet, the country has remained largely rural, with more than
            half of its population working in the agricultural sector,
            which only contributed 17 percent of GDP in 20142. In some
            countries, urbanization has been used as a tool to
            accelerate economic growth and poverty reduction. As Vietnam
            aims to maintain a high growth rate, supporting
            urbanization, where cities contribute a growing share of
            jobs and GDP, will be an important measure. This structural
            shift will drive population growth and new demand for
            housing in cities, for which quality and affordable housing
            options in well-serviced and connected settlements will be
            needed. Areas of particular importance in the Law is support
            toward self-built housing, the active participation of the
            private sector, addressing the shortage of affordable rental
            housing as well as high demand for housing from low income
            groups, especially workers in industrial zones of large
            cities. This report, which includes a comprehensive
            assessment and roadmap for affordable housing in Vietnam,
            recommends the following key messages moving forward:
            increase investment, Prepare Three Flagship Initiatives
            under an umbrella National Affordable Housing Program,
            Institutional Strengthening, Land Tax Reform, and Create an
            Enabling Environment for Affordable Housing. Moving forward,
            design of the market-oriented measures described above will
            require intensive and careful consultation and engagement
            with all housing sector actors, particularly the private
            sector. Private sector will need to play an active role in
            the early preparation to ensure their participation and
            commitment that carries through to implementation of policy
            measures on the financing and supply side.
