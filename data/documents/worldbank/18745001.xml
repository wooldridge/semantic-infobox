&#13;
ZIEGLER: Today is February 15th, 2006. My name is Charles Ziegler, a consultant with the&#13;
World Bank Group Oral History Program. I have with me at the Archives of the World Bank&#13;
Group Mr. Dennis de Tray. Mr. de Tray joined the World Bank in 1983 as the chief of the Living&#13;
Standards Unit, Development Research Department. In 1986, he became policy adviser in the&#13;
Development Research Department.&#13;
&#13;
From June 1987 until the end of 1990, Mr. de Tray was the research administrator in the Policy,&#13;
Planning and Research senior vice presidency. He became senior economic adviser in the&#13;
Development Economics vice presidency in 1991.&#13;
&#13;
In January 1992, Mr. de Tray switched to operations. He became the chief ofthe Bolivia,&#13;
Colombia and Dominican Republic Country Operations Division in the Latin American and&#13;
Caribbean Region.&#13;
&#13;
In April1994, things really became interesting, as he became director ofthe resident staff in&#13;
Indonesia, being appointed as one of the first decentralized country directors, in this case for&#13;
Indonesia, in July 1997. As such, Mr. de Tray had a front-row seat for the Indonesian segment of&#13;
the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s.&#13;
&#13;
In September 1999, Mr. de Tray was appointed senior resident representative of the International&#13;
Monetary Fund in Hanoi, Vietnam. In August 2001, he returned to the World Bank, briefly&#13;
holding the post of senior adviser, Central Asia County Unit, Europe and Central Asia Region.&#13;
&#13;
In October of 2001, Mr. de Tray was appointed regional director for Central Asia, Europe and&#13;
the Central Asia Region, and was based in Almaty, Kazakhstan. He retired from World Bank in&#13;
January 2006. Well, we're very glad to have you here, Dennis, and to start things off, would you&#13;
just put things in autobiographical context? When and where were you born?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Thank you, Chuck. I was born in Napoleon, Ohio, aptly named, as my ancestors are&#13;
French, in 1944. I grew up for the first six years of my life there and then-my father is a&#13;
veterinarian-we moved to Mexico for a year, and then to the East Coast, to Maryland, near the&#13;
Beltsville Research Station, where my father was working.&#13;
&#13;
My overseas experience began in earnest in 1954, when my father moved the family to Nairobi,&#13;
Kenya, where I eventually graduated from the Prince of Wales High School, returning to the&#13;
States to attend Cornell University, graduating from Cornell in the absolute heat of the Vietnam&#13;
War era, deciding that graduate school was better than going to Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
I went to Utah State for what turned out to be a little over a year-and-a-half, where I met my&#13;
wife. I got a master's degree and was eventually accepted to the University of Chicago for the&#13;
                                     Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                    February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Ph.D. program. So it was a very productive year. I graduated from the University of Chicago,&#13;
and then began my professional career.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I note there is a publication from the Prince of Wales School, The Old Cambrian&#13;
Society, and it notes that your school nickname was Texas. I wonder how that came about.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: I was the only-and maybe the first-American in the Prince of Wales. This was&#13;
back in the mid- to late '50s. It was still very much a colonial era, still a segregated society, so&#13;
the school was all white. It was a boarding school-and I was a boarding student-that drew&#13;
from many parts of eastern and southern Africa, from Rhodesia to Kenya. So it had a mix of&#13;
Afrikaners, of British, of others there, and back in the days when Kenya was known as a wild&#13;
and woolly place.&#13;
&#13;
But, anyway, I was the only American, and for most of the world at that point from cowboy&#13;
movies, etcetera there was only one state in the United States. That was Texas, so I was Texas.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That's interesting. My wife is British, and she said it was the same thing in England&#13;
when she was growing up at about the same time. American was the Wild West.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Absolutely. One of my earliest recollections during that period was the incredible&#13;
need to be accepted, and I had just enough of a British accent that when I came back here I was&#13;
teased for that, and just enough of an American accent that when I was there, I was obviously not&#13;
British. So it was one of those things that always stuck with me, our innate desires to be accepted&#13;
by our peers.&#13;
&#13;
And the other thing I can remember distinctly-it was a fantastic time. You know, Kenya was a&#13;
paradise in those days, and still remains a place near and dear to my heart.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: But corrupt now.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: An enormously sad story. I took my family back there on a sort of roots trip in the&#13;
late 1980s, and it was one ofthe most wonderful, most amazing vacations we've ever had. My&#13;
kids were at that point 16 and 10, I think, two boys. My older son was just graduated from high&#13;
school. He would have signed up for the duration if he could have found a job. He loved it. We&#13;
went to Masai Mara. It was truly one of those great events oflife, and for me wonderful to see&#13;
the joys and the high points of Kenya. But also it was very sad even in those days to see what&#13;
was happening to what should be a great country.&#13;
&#13;
I can remember leaving Kenya in 1961 and, first, incredibly excited to return to the United&#13;
States. I thought the streets would be paved with gold, that it was going to be just wonderful and&#13;
that all the things that bothered me about Kenya wouldn't be there. I was determined to find a&#13;
small town and settle down and never travel again. That was my aim in life then, but things&#13;
turned out quite differently.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Prior to joining the World Bank, what were some of your earlier work experiences?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                    February 15 and 21 and March 21, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: I left the University of Chicago in 1971 and joined the RAND Corporation, which&#13;
is a policy research institute on the West Coast.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now, one thing-that was more of a defense think tank?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: It was started after Second World War by the Air Force as a defense research tank,&#13;
working on very broad, strategic issues. By the time I arrived in 1971, it had begun to develop&#13;
what it called the domestic side of its research program, and that's the side that I joined.&#13;
Domestic research was about 45 percent of RAND's activities at that point, and it focused on&#13;
issues of welfare reform, population analysis, labor regulations, and so forth-U.S. domestic&#13;
policies, and that's what I was hired to do.&#13;
&#13;
I continued to work in those areas until 1976, when, almost as a lark, my wife and I decided we&#13;
would take a leave of absence and join the Population Council for two years under a USAID&#13;
[United States Agency for International Development]-funded project. I served as the resident&#13;
research adviser to the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics in Islamabad, Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
It wasn't a lark. It turned out to be a very interesting thing to do, but it was certainly a major&#13;
adventure-we had at that point a three-year-old son, our first child. We went over and had a&#13;
marvelous time. I was the only expatriate in PIDE [Pakistan Institute of Development&#13;
Economics], and that gave us a very special "in" to Pakistan society, especially to the young,&#13;
bright people that were associated with the research institute. So it was a grand time.&#13;
&#13;
Most importantly, it was a time that shaped my career. Before I went there, I was an economist&#13;
interested in U.S. welfare issues and the U.S. labor markets. When I came back, I was convinced&#13;
that the interesting questions and issues were in the developing parts of the world, that I could be&#13;
one of 1,000 or 10,000 economists working on U.S. developed-country issues, or I could actually&#13;
try to take the best of economics to the really difficult issues of developing economies.&#13;
&#13;
You may recall that in those early days-and this is sort ofthe end ofthat period-development&#13;
economics was almost a separate field in economics. It was right at the end of the period when&#13;
economists still viewed developing countries as operating under a different set of economic&#13;
rules. That view no longer exists, and I was very fortunate to study with people who helped&#13;
change that image-T. [Theodore] W. Schultz and others at the University of Chicago.&#13;
&#13;
By the way, one factoid: I was one of very few people that had two Nobel Laureates on my thesis&#13;
committee. I didn't ever go that far, but that ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Who were they, if I may ask?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Gary [S.] Becker and Schultz. They were fantastic people. The University of&#13;
Chicago was a life-shaping experience for me. It was a great university and that's where I began&#13;
to understand what economics was all about.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Was [Friedrich von] Hayek there at the time?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                    February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: It was after his period, but it was in the heyday ofthe University of Chicago&#13;
Economics Department. It was ranked the number one graduate program in the world at that&#13;
time.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In the world?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: In the world. It was the time ofMilton Friedman and [George J.] Stigler and [H.&#13;
Gregg] Lewis, and ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That's W. Arthur?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: No. Gregg Lewis, who was a labor economist.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Oh, okay, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: And who else was there at the time? [Arnold] Harberger, and-Stigler I got. But&#13;
aside from the names, which at that point MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] and&#13;
Harvard also had, it was an environment in which the faculty made the students feel like they&#13;
were the most important people that they were dealing with. Access was terrific. The support we&#13;
got was fabulous. We were treated with respect, as serious people. A marvelous experience-so&#13;
it was a great early start to my career.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, we went to Pakistan, and I came back to RAND and was determined to shift gears and&#13;
work on development issues. Fortunately, at that time some of my colleagues at RAND had been&#13;
working on something called the Malaysia Family Life Survey, which was an effort to&#13;
understand over time the way households evolved and responded to their environment and policy&#13;
changes.&#13;
&#13;
I came back and decided to put together something called the Family in Economic Development&#13;
Center, which was financed by, I believe at the time, the largest single research grant that&#13;
USAID had given, a million-[$] 1.8 million, or something like that.&#13;
&#13;
It was a substantially large research grant in those days, and it supported me for, I think, five&#13;
years. Through that we launched a program that continues to operate at RAND today. That&#13;
experience paved the way for what I eventually did when I first got to the Bank. It introduced me&#13;
to the ins and outs of the collection of household data, and also to what kinds of data from&#13;
households researchers needed to analyze interesting questions and issues.&#13;
&#13;
I got a call in 1983 from Anne [0.] Krueger, who was then the Vice President for Research and&#13;
Economics at the Bank, the Bank's chief economist, whom I knew a bit from my research days&#13;
and who had been a colleague of a colleague ofmine, Paul Schultz, Ted Schultz's son. She asked&#13;
me ifl would be interested in joining the Bank to take over the living standards measurement&#13;
study.&#13;
&#13;
I can to this day remember calling Ted Schultz at the University of Chicago, somebody I turned&#13;
to for advice almost until he died. And I said, "What do you think?"&#13;
                                     Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                    February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "You know, Dennis," he said, "I think the World Bank needs you," which was&#13;
wonderful advice.&#13;
&#13;
So I decided, okay, I'd go.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, as you say, you began your career as chief of the Living Standards Unit.&#13;
What kind of work did you do there? What was the work of the unit, its major accomplishments&#13;
during your period there, and the major obstacles and challenges that you faced?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: When I arrived to take over the unit, it was-I think it's not too extreme a&#13;
description-sort of moribund. It had started in 1979 under [F.] Graham Pyatt's guidance, and it&#13;
had really gotten bogged down in minutia-debates among survey experts about what could and&#13;
couldn't be done. It had lost its way.&#13;
&#13;
I think my success in that period was because I brought in some very good people to work with,&#13;
but also that I told those people that within 18 months we were going to have a survey in the&#13;
field or we were going to close shop.&#13;
&#13;
I said, "We cannot keep spinning wheels. We have to do something. If we get into the field and it&#13;
fails, so be it. We have to do something on the ground to test this out." It was a wonderful&#13;
experience, something that has influenced me ever since. If you give good people clear stretch&#13;
goals, it's amazing what they will deliver.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: If they're the right people.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Case in point: one ofthe aspects ofthis work that distinguished it eventually was&#13;
the speed with which the data became available. In those days, researchers got data that were&#13;
often two or more years old. In the fast-changing world of developing countries, that's okay for&#13;
basic research, but not good for policy research and policy design. We wanted a process that&#13;
would yield data not in years, but months. I was lucky that PCs [personal computers] were just&#13;
coming of age. I wanted an entry system that allowed computer-illiterate people in developing&#13;
countries-high school grads-to add data in a way that at the end of it we could press a button&#13;
and we would get the basic set of reports out.&#13;
&#13;
I asked the Bureau of the Census if this was possible and if they would help. They said, "Yes, it's&#13;
possible. It would probably take 18 months to two years to develop." I didn't have 18 months. I&#13;
was in Cote d'Ivoire on a Bank mission, and I met a Chilean, Juan Munoz. Juan Munoz ran a&#13;
small survey firm in Santiago. We met at the Hotel Ivoire. He was working with a friend, and we&#13;
spent an evening together. I happened to have brought one of the first-ever laptops with me. This&#13;
was a Radio Shack. It was one of the little things, completely useless in today's terms, but it was&#13;
months, if not weeks old, so it was a hot item.&#13;
&#13;
Juan was fascinated with it, so he asked if he could borrow it. I think he stayed up most of the&#13;
night, and by morning he had managed to program this to do some amazing things.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                    February 15 and 21 and March 21, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I said to Juan, "I have a serious problem. I want a program that will be bullet-proof, that we can&#13;
put on a PC with very simple instructions so people can enter these data. It has to have&#13;
safeguards that won't let them do the wrong thing. It has to have consistency checks so that if&#13;
somebody makes a mistake and puts in 10,000 instead of 1,000, the machine will say, 'Are you&#13;
sure?"' I asked him, "Do you think it's possible."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Sure."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "How long will it take?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "It might take me two months."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "You're hired."&#13;
&#13;
A long story short, I brought him to the Bank for two years, and he developed a whole software&#13;
structure for the Living Standards Measurement Survey.&#13;
&#13;
When we first took this survey to the field in the Cote d'Ivoire, two months after the final&#13;
household survey, we had not only usable data but results-tables and some basic analysis. In&#13;
those days that was absolutely revolutionary. Nobody had ever seen this done before. That&#13;
methodology still underpins the Bank's efforts to monitor welfare change in households, and in&#13;
many other places-the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and&#13;
others.&#13;
&#13;
When Anne Krueger met me after she left the Bank, she very kindly said that she considered one&#13;
of her greatest accomplishments at the Bank the work that was done under the Living Standards&#13;
Measurement Study. It was one of the more lasting things that I can point to that I've done. It still&#13;
exists. It was an institutional investment, but I think it has really paid off.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: How has it evolved since then?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: It is now widely used in all of our poverty assessments. It's an almost regular&#13;
feature of most of our poor country dialogues. It's part of the monitoring program that people use&#13;
in everything from CPIA [Country Policy and Institutional Assessment] assessments of&#13;
countries' performance. It has fueled a massive amount of research on everything from labor&#13;
force participation to school attendance, to health outcomes, to the role of credit markets.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So it has had a wide-ranging influence within the Bank even on ...&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Within the Bank and outside the Bank. It has, in my judgment-and I haven't kept&#13;
that close tab on it-it has taken too much of a research tum. I wanted this to be a direct tool for&#13;
policymakers in developing countries. I think the team could claim considerable success for&#13;
producing data that were timely and of a quality and a breadth that would serve to inform&#13;
policymakers if they chose to be informed.&#13;
&#13;
We were much less successful at integrating this into the decision making that policymakers in&#13;
                                     Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                    February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
developing countries do. It was probably something that was a bit before its time. Even today in&#13;
many countries, they really don't have the capacity to go beyond the immediate challenges they&#13;
face. But the data do begin to inform programs to allocate resources in countries by identifying&#13;
where the poor are and who they are. When the Bank strengthened its focus on the poor, this was&#13;
a tool that really came into its own.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The Bank's research program began in 1971. In 1984 the Research Policy Co.uncil,&#13;
which had been established the previous year, felt that while the Bank's research program would&#13;
remain eclectic, it was necessary to shift its focus at the margin to meet new concerns and needs.&#13;
It therefore sought to translate the continuing broad objectives of Bank research into specific new&#13;
research priorities.&#13;
&#13;
It noted that a useful and policy-relevant applied research program in the social sciences must be&#13;
concerned with testing and changing beliefs and behavior based on premises about how the&#13;
world could, should or does work. In this task, both basic research and applied research are&#13;
relevant, and the beliefs are based both on logical deductions-that is, abstract theorizing-as&#13;
well as inductive empirical evidence on various aspects ofthe economy.&#13;
&#13;
How did this shift affect you, specifically, as chief of the Living Standards Unit, and did you&#13;
have any input into the decision to make this shift?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: The Bank has always struggled to find its niche in the research community. The&#13;
debates that were taking place at that time-in some ways the design and use of the Living&#13;
Standards Measurement Survey methodology was really a microcosm of that debate.&#13;
&#13;
My view was that if it didn't have a policy outcome, I was not interested in supporting it. I never&#13;
viewed the Bank as a basic research organization. Universities are basic research organizations,&#13;
think tanks are basic research organizations. The Bank should be taking that knowledge and&#13;
applying it to better the lives of people. This was a theme that went through both the Living&#13;
Standards Measurement Survey and my work as research administrator.&#13;
&#13;
It's something I still think is relevant today because the Bank does too much research that is&#13;
indistinguishable from university research. In my view, that's not right. We have some of the&#13;
highest paid researchers in the United States, and that work could be done quite well at much&#13;
lower cost outside the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So in the Bank historically, over time, there has been a push-well, not a push, but&#13;
how shall I put it-a bias toward basic research, as opposed to more policy-oriented ...&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: The challenge, particularly in PREM [Poverty Reduction and Economic&#13;
Management] and among economists, is what master will they serve. They want to be part of a&#13;
professional community that rewards publications and refereed journal articles and cutting-edge&#13;
research. That is not what the Bank should do.&#13;
&#13;
We need to do a little of it because it's a part of creating our enabling environment and giving us&#13;
credibility in debates, but we should limit it a lot. What we really should focus on is extracting&#13;

the lessons from what we do. We're a unique organization. I say "we" even though it's no longer&#13;
we, but you understand.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: When you say "we" ...&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: The Bank, the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes, but extracting the lessons-when you say what we do, you mean more than&#13;
just research, but the whole-everything?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: No, it's precisely what we do outside of research that makes us unique.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: We do I don't remember how many projects a year. Every one of them is an&#13;
experiment in development. There is no consistent focus on learning the lessons in a systematic&#13;
way that maximizes the returns to this extraordinary wealth of information.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Not even the Operations Evaluation [Independent Evaluation Group], for instance?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: The problem with Operations Evaluation are twofold-one, what they're being&#13;
asked to do is incredibly difficult because often they're being asked to speculate on the&#13;
counterfactual. What would have happened if this instrument or that project or policy hadn't been&#13;
put in place? A very difficult question under any circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
Two, they're being asked to tease out what this particular project or policy did in a policy&#13;
environment that's very messy and in a global environment in which a thousand things are&#13;
changing. Where we miss-and it has gotten better, but I don't think it's as good as it should&#13;
be-is that we need to design projects and policies with a capacity to evaluate them later-better&#13;
baseline surveys, maybe some random assignment of the treatment; you would stand a much&#13;
better chance of understanding what the treatment actually did. We just haven't done enough of&#13;
that.&#13;
&#13;
There's also a sense in which our analysis is hampered by the fact that we're an institution that&#13;
wants to succeed. The research focus is one thing, but for me the issue is one of learning the&#13;
lessons from our own history and our own activities.&#13;
&#13;
If one wants to see why this is not working, go to a meeting on an early concept of something to&#13;
do with institutional development. More often than not, what's recommended by the experts has&#13;
failed 27 times in a row. If you ask them, "Can you give me a case where it has worked in this&#13;
environment?" the answer is silence. That's not good enough&#13;
&#13;
Our institution is a development institution. Our relationship with clients and the project and&#13;
policy dialogue is our key product; everything else should serve it. So the incentive structure&#13;
should be for the research community in the Bank-very smart and very good-to have to do&#13;
stuff that's being demanded by the operations side ofthe Bank, except, as I said, for a small&#13;

ZIEGLER: More latitude.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: .. big bang stuff-one needs that-and to represent the Bank in big think&#13;
discussions. But we're a long ways from the right margin in that setting.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In 1986 you became policy adviser in the Development Research Department.&#13;
What occasioned that promotion?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Greg [Gregory K.] Ingram, who was my first director, was looking for a deputy to&#13;
help him manage the Research Department, and I like to think that the success of the Living&#13;
Standards Measurement Study program, and maybe some other contributions I had made along&#13;
the way, made Greg think about somebody inside his group.&#13;
&#13;
It was not an uncontroversial appointment. I can remember an unnamed colleague who I still&#13;
know and I'm still friends with, saying to me, "What makes you think you can give me policy&#13;
advice?" Reminds me of my being senior economic adviser to Larry [Lawrence H.] Summers.&#13;
Nobody advises Larry Summers on economics, so these are sort of ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Or anything else.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Or almost anything else. We'll come to that later. But my point is that "policy&#13;
adviser" is a term that covers a multitude of sins, and my job was really to help Greg think&#13;
through the direction the department was going.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes. I was going to ask you what your primary duties were.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Pretty eclectic: a bit review; a bit strategic thinking; some management support for&#13;
the department-keeping the trains running on time-but it was only tangentially "policy&#13;
advice." It was inputs into a variety of work that the department was doing and that Greg was&#13;
overseemg.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In November 1986, during your time as policy adviser, a report on the World Bank&#13;
Research Program, Part One, report number 6505, November 1986, noted, quote, "The Bank's&#13;
research program continues to be guided by four objectives: to support all aspects of the Bank's&#13;
operations; to broaden understanding of the development process; to improve the Bank's capacity&#13;
to provide advice to member countries; and to assist in developing indigenous research capacity&#13;
in member countries." How did you and your colleagues proceed at that time in pursuit of those&#13;
objectives? You've talked about this to some extent already, but I'm looking here at specific&#13;
activities you undertook at that time.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: This is as policy adviser?&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Uh-huh.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: The question is actually for me more relevant in my next job, which was research&#13;
administrator. But in this case nothing comes springing to mind that was directly related to this&#13;
job except a general statement that Greg was partly responsible as director of the Research&#13;
Department. I codified the general platform on which the Bank's research program was being&#13;
driven at that point.&#13;
&#13;
It was at a time when, as I recall, Deepak Lal and Anne Krueger were dominant figures in the&#13;
Bank's research program, and somewhat controversial figures. Deepak had his famous&#13;
comparative studies program.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And he's still writing books, too. He's got some interesting ones around.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: He's a very smart guy.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Unintended Consequences [MIT Press, 1998]. Isn't it the title of it?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: But anyway, I think it had no direct bearing on what I was doing, except that it was&#13;
the filter through which we were putting our decisions on resource allocation. The Research&#13;
Department had its own budget and did its own things, and then there was the Bank's research&#13;
program, which the research administrator was running at that point.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The report on the Bank's research program cited earlier notes that the four&#13;
objectives of the program" .. guide the current Bank's research program as they underline the&#13;
twin functions that research performs in the Bank, both supporting Bank operations as an&#13;
intermediate input-important for the Bank's role as policy adviser to developing countries-and&#13;
as one of the important final outputs of the Bank in keeping the Bank in the forefront of thinking&#13;
on the economics of developing countries and sharing research results with the development&#13;
community."&#13;
&#13;
In your view, did the intermediate input over the years that you were involved provide value to&#13;
the Bank's operational work commensurate with the cost of producing those products, and if so,&#13;
could you cite some examples?&#13;
&#13;
Now, again, you've been touching on this quite heavily. I've always been-for no reason other&#13;
than sheer intuition, which is most likely wrong, but I've always had trouble seeing how the&#13;
research-! mean, I can see how it could input into the Bank's operations, but does it? And that's&#13;
really my question.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Your instincts are correct to ask the question. You can cite, for example, the work&#13;
we did on the Living Standards Measurement Study, which has become a standard operational&#13;
tool that informs the allocation of resources in developing countries, informs the allocation of&#13;
Bank resources in developing countries, is the touchstone against which we judge the poverty&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
mandate of the Bank. It had clear, practical significance which remains in effect today. That's a&#13;
sustainable institutional impact.&#13;
&#13;
I think far too much of the research we've done has been at a level of generality that makes it&#13;
very unhelpful to those on the front line. I am not a fan of big, splashy studies, as an operations&#13;
person. As a positioning instrument for the Bank, yes, the WDR [World Development Report]&#13;
works. It's probably way more expensive than it needs to be, but it has a niche that carries the&#13;
Bank's intellectual capital forward on a regular basis.&#13;
&#13;
But I had a long debate with my ex-colleagues in ECA [Europe and Central Asia Region] about&#13;
our regional studies program. No decentralized operational manager, whether a country manager&#13;
or country director, none that I was dealing with found any of those studies useful. They were&#13;
simply too abstract, too generalized, and often came out with research statements that you could&#13;
have written before they did the research that bore an amazing resemblance to common sense.&#13;
They were lost opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
The real reason that I don't think the Bank should do basic research is that in many respects we&#13;
know what the objectives are that we're trying to achieve. We know, broadly speaking, the&#13;
instruments that we need to use to achieve them. Where we fail is on implementation, and so the&#13;
research should inform that. We do not have a good paper in the Bank's cadre of work that tells&#13;
you how to develop the private sector where there is no banking system, no rule of law, no&#13;
courts, and property rights are weak.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Good luck to you.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: But we're asked to do it every day. For countries in the bottom half ofthe IDA&#13;
[International Development Association] income distribution we're told, "Make the private sector&#13;
work in this country." How do you make a banking system work where none of the prerequisites&#13;
exist?&#13;
&#13;
We spend money, technical assistance, lend money on doing this without having answers to&#13;
basic questions. Those are the questions that we should be focusing on as an institution. It's&#13;
something I feel quite strongly about as someone who has had one foot in research and one foot&#13;
in operations for a very long time.&#13;
&#13;
I think we answer general questions that make for grand documents and that allow us, as&#13;
somebody put the statement at a conference I was at the other day, to operate at 30,000 or 40,000&#13;
feet in the air, but not to actually move the ball forward on the ground in the countries that we&#13;
need to help.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes. You're particularly interesting because you've been on the research side, and&#13;
then you were on the receiving end, so to speak.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Exactly.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So I think you have an unusual perspective. I don't think that transition happens too&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
frequently.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: I'm amazed it doesn't. First, I will tell you when I left RAND, I knew I wanted to&#13;
be in operations at the Bank. Ifl wanted to be a researcher, I would have stayed at RAND. It's a&#13;
great place to do research. My frustration was not being closer to the action. I didn't want to&#13;
advise people. I didn't want to write papers that somebody else implemented. I wanted to have&#13;
the buck to stop on my desk. I wanted to be the person that was trying to sell a change to the&#13;
person who was going to implement the policy. I could not have been an elected official, but I&#13;
wanted to be as close as I could be.&#13;
&#13;
It took me eight years to shed my research background, and I was lucky that [S. Shahid] Husain&#13;
took a flyer on me and let me into LAC [Latin America and the Caribbean Region]. And the rest&#13;
is history. I loved it. It remains an enormous mystery to me why people that come to the Bank&#13;
don't go the route I went. The real excitement of the Bank is what I did, not in research. Being a&#13;
researcher for 8 or 10 years and moving into operations is exactly right. You get this broad basis&#13;
of knowledge, and then you get an opportunity to use it.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes. I was going to ask did it help in your ...&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Absolutely, particularly if you're going to move in the direction of country manager&#13;
or country director. In those places, you need a broad base because you're making difficult&#13;
tradeoffs among sectors, within sectors, among instruments, stuff that really nobody can grasp in&#13;
the full.&#13;
&#13;
But if you dealt with all this through your research career and read the literature a bit, had some&#13;
sense of the debate and what is going on and developed some instincts, it holds you in good stead&#13;
when you come to the operations side. I have absolutely loved being in operations at the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Lumps and all?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Absolutely, and there have been some major lumps, as we'll get to.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: I've asked some of my research colleagues, who have been at the Bank for 20 years&#13;
and always in research, why they didn't move to operations. They say, well, you know, we're&#13;
pretty happy where we are. But it's just not where it's at, so I'm puzzled why more people don't&#13;
do what I did. I think it's exactly the right path.&#13;

&#13;
ZIEGLER: ... mentioned previously, did the research program, in your view, indeed keep the&#13;
Bank in the forefront of thinking on the economics of developing countries?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: There's no simple answer to that question. It did in some areas; in some areas it did&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
cutting-edge work. As I say, my concern was not that the Bank did or did not have the ability to&#13;
do cutting-edge work, but should we be doing cutting-edge work?&#13;
&#13;
The more basic and cutting-edge the work would appear to me as a policy adviser, and later as&#13;
research administrator, the less I was likely to support it unless it was cutting-edge, as I said, on&#13;
understanding implementational failures or institutional failures that would be directly relevant&#13;
to the work that operations staff did.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank has produced over the course of the years some seminal work. The WDR series is a&#13;
compendium reference work in a particular area that is turned to by many, many people. They&#13;
are very high-quality and very well done, and usually done by some of the Bank's best and&#13;
brightest. But they are positioning documents that keep the Bank in play intellectually, as does&#13;
the Annual Bank Conference on Development Economics, which I started with Stan [Stanley]&#13;
Fischer. These are not arenas in which you debate the nitty-gritty of on-the-grourid&#13;
implementation or policy issues.&#13;
&#13;
So it's not a matter of yes or no; it's a matter of how much. My sense is that the Bank spends too&#13;
much money on positioning. Maybe it should do one big report a year that thinks about the sort&#13;
of big-ticket issues. The rest of the Bank, the intellectual property of the Bank, should be aimed&#13;
at improving our impact on the ground.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In the September 1988 issue ofthe Bank's World you were quoted as saying with&#13;
regard to the dissemination of the results of research projects in the Bank, quote, "The problem is&#13;
that we have done a less than adequate job of disseminating the output of research projects in a&#13;
form that is accessible to development practitioners, as well as to active researchers," unquote.&#13;
&#13;
How were the results of research actually disseminated, both internally and externally, at that&#13;
time, and how did you proceed to address the problem of dissemination of the results of research&#13;
projects?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: This problem of dissemination remains until today, in my judgment. It is&#13;
fundamentally the problem that the Bank's research is not developed in a market environment.&#13;
Nobody has to buy it.&#13;
&#13;
When I was at RAND-RAND is a non-profit organization, and it does have a chunk of money&#13;
that comes from the Defense Department as a funding base, but a large part of its annual&#13;
revenues comes from competitive grants and contracts. It has to be market-sensitive, and&#13;
dissemination was hugely important. RAND had an entire department that did nothing but&#13;
review what today would be referred to as PowerPoint presentations that would go back to&#13;
Washington, a small, but very, very effective department. You had to dry run your presentation,&#13;
and inevitably they took it apart and put it back together again because researchers instinctively&#13;
get it wrong. Their main aim in life is to tell you how hard they worked, and all the nitty-gritty&#13;
details of what they did, something that 99 percent ofthe world doesn't care about. Eventually&#13;
they may actually tell you what they found, but almost never did they tell you why it mattered.&#13;
So we tried to reverse that and to get people to focus on the "why." When people came in to ask&#13;
for research money, one of the tests was, "Why don't you write down what you think most likely&#13;
                                      Dennis N. de Tray&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
you're going to find? Guess, and then prove to me that it matters."&#13;
&#13;
Researchers would come in and tell me, "Population is a very important problem for&#13;
development. Therefore, you should give me money to do population research." It doesn't&#13;
follow. What would we do differently if you find "x" or "y" or "z" or "a?" If you're a basic&#13;
researcher, you don't have to tell me that. If you're an applied policy researcher, you have to tell&#13;
me why it's going to matter, or we cannot go forward.&#13;
&#13;
We tried, I think, with only limited success to move the Bank out of the Stone Age era of&#13;
dissemination to one that actually tried to package the output of research in ways that would&#13;
impact on the audience we were trying to influence.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In June 1987, you became research administrator in what shortly became the&#13;
Policy, Planning and Research Senior Vice Presidency. What were your primary duties in this&#13;
position? Now, clearly, you were running the research aspect ofthe Bank, but could you just be a&#13;
little bit specific about what you ...&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: The Bank's central research program was in those days a $5-$5.5 million grants-&#13;
based competitive program. People applied for the money, and there was a review committee&#13;
that I chaired. We also were responsible for helping promote dissemination of Bank research.&#13;
There were at that point two Bank journals. One was somewhat more theoretical, and one was&#13;
more applied.&#13;
&#13;
We began, as I said, when Stan Fischer came in after Anne Krueger left, to develop a&#13;
dissemination program built around the Annual Bank Conference on Development Economics,&#13;
ABCDE, an acronym that Stan Fischer himself came up with.&#13;
&#13;
We were trying to do two things: one, to inform the world about the research the Bank was&#13;
doing, but, almost as importantly, to connect Bank researchers to the rest of the world. Bank&#13;
researchers can be very isolated. They often don't have to publish in refereed journals. They're&#13;
not as visible in the conference circuit. Oftentimes, they're very insular, and that's not healthy.&#13;
Often, they re-discover the wheel because they don't know it has been discovered twice before.&#13;
&#13;
Each year we had to take to the Board the Annual Report on Bank Research, which was a report&#13;
on research across the Bank: work done in the operations complexes, work done outside, and&#13;
work done inside the centrally-funded Bank research program.&#13;
&#13;
We tried to create some sense of coherence in all this research and give the Board a sense of the&#13;
directions we were trying to take in the future. And that was under the broad remit the Bank's&#13;
chief economist.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: How did the Board usually react to-how were your interactions with the Board?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: I have always enjoyed interacting with the Board. I have ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That sounds-that's probably unusual. I don't know.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: It may be, but again, it's one ofthose things that puzzles me. I have found it&#13;
extremely easy to work with the Board, and one thing that I think has made a difference is that I&#13;
never hesitated to tell them what was true. I never pulled the wool over their eyes. I never played&#13;
any bureaucratic games.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Not the mushroom theory of management?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Not the mushroom theory. I treated them like adults. The research reports were&#13;
always really quite well received. It's a kind of noncontroversial part of the Bank, so it was a&#13;
nice entree into the interaction with the Board.&#13;
&#13;
Through my early days in operations, which we will come to, I found that being open and honest&#13;
with the Board was repaid with respect and understanding. I have always looked forward to&#13;
taking strategies or operations to the Board because it's an interesting interaction. The Board was&#13;
always supportive of the research program, and we got good marks on that.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In the summer of 1987, the World Bank underwent a thorough reorganization, or as&#13;
some of us think, a disorganization. Among the results was the establishment of a Policy,&#13;
Planning and Research Senior Vice Presidency. Did you have any role in formulating and&#13;
establishing this new organization entity?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: As were most senior staff at that time, I was part of the broader dialogue and was&#13;
consulted on the research side. But this was a study on how not to do a reorganization, as we all&#13;
know, and so I don't want to claim too much credit for anything that went on there.&#13;
&#13;
For an institution that preaches the gospel of incentives, this reorganization provided the worst&#13;
set of incentives to deliver on the objective it was trying to deliver I've ever seen. You put a&#13;
minus sign in front of everything that you're trying to achieve and that's what you ended up&#13;
getting. It was not a very well-thought-through reorganization.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: How did the reorganization of 1987 affect you personally?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: It was very good for me because I was selected as research administrator. That was&#13;
a major promotion from my previous position, and it gave me a point of visibility in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
I may have been the last, if you will, research czar at the Bank. After that, the position of&#13;
research administrator really became much more administrative and much less substantive. I was&#13;
very fortunate to work under people, particularly Stan Fischer, whom I've known since my&#13;
Chicago days.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Oh, you knew him ...&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: He was a post-doc [post-doctoral student] at [the University of] Chicago, and he&#13;
and I have remained close friends since those days. He's a man I have enormous respect for, and&#13;
a man whose life and mine intertwined in amazing ways over the years. This was one of those&#13;
                                     Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                    February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ways. He came in as the Bank's chief economist, and he was extremely supportive of the work&#13;
we were doing in the centrally-funded research program. And as I said, we worked very closely&#13;
together on the conference and many other things. He was the best boss I ever had.&#13;
&#13;
I was fortunate. Research administrator was still a position of interest and some authority. It did&#13;
have a role in shaping the research program. I didn't have dictatorial powers but what I didn't&#13;
want done didn't get done. It was my job, I thought, to bring a sense of direction and quality to&#13;
the program.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Is it better to have what you would call a research czar, as you were, compared with&#13;
what you have now, where it's a more administrative job?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: I think it's more administrative now because the structure has changed so much&#13;
within the Bank with the networks. Now, you've got a vice president for DEC [Development&#13;
Economics], Francois [J.] Bourguignon. You've got a whole process that looks after this, and to&#13;
whom the research administrator reports, and it is an administration role now. So is that bad?&#13;
Good? Maybe just different.&#13;
&#13;
The work from those days-! think we did some interesting things. As I say, the Board seemed&#13;
to like what we were doing and gave us kudos for it.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The report on the World Bank research program, report number 7125, February&#13;
1988, published a few months after you became research administrator, notes, quote, "Four shifts&#13;
in research spending between the early 1980s and 1987 are noteworthy. First, the share of&#13;
departmentally-approved research rose from 42 percent to 51 percent, meaning that less research&#13;
is subject to central review and coordination. Second, the share of research on sectoral topics has&#13;
fallen from 65 percent to 42 percent, reflecting a growing emphasis on macroeconomic and&#13;
international trade issues. Third, the centrally-funded research portfolio was dominated by four&#13;
large comparative studies and an array of small projects, with relatively few medium-size&#13;
projects in the $100,000 to $300,000 range. Fourth, the share of centrally-funded research&#13;
managed by regional staff continued to decline."&#13;
&#13;
Taking each of these shifts in turn, or even just generally if you prefer, from your perspective&#13;
were they positive or negative developments?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Some were positive and some were negative. They are related. The shift to macro&#13;
and trade and the four large studies are the same thing. Anne Krueger was a trade economist;&#13;
Deepak Lal was interested in macro issues, and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
The four large comparative studies were not all macro, but they largely would have been-would&#13;
have fallen in that category, and they dominated in that period of time. That was more Anne&#13;
Krueger's time through Stan Fischer, too, after he came in.&#13;
&#13;
The shift away from Regional staff research to center, I personally thought was a good thing. I've&#13;
never really understood why the Bank felt that operations staff would make good researchers. It's&#13;
a specialty that needs to ask the right question, but in terms of writing ability and being up to&#13;
                                     Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                    February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
date on methodologies, why would somebody who is in the midst of an operations complex&#13;
qualify, except by chance?&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I \vas thinking more like real-world perspective, adding ...&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: That's a very correct assessment and an important point. There should be another&#13;
name for what people write about the operations work aside from research. I don't know,&#13;
experience or notes or something. The shift away from centrally-funded research to non-&#13;
centrally-funded research was, at the time, worrisome because it meant less coherence in the&#13;
research program and therefore harder to defend. And I think it's still true today.&#13;
&#13;
In those days, either Anne or Stan was responsible not just for the research under their mandate&#13;
but the Bank's research program more widely. So the coherence issue and whether it all added&#13;
up, or the sum was greater than the parts was an important issue. The less oversight there was in&#13;
what got done and the more it was driven by different agendas across the Bank, the less&#13;
coherence there was. So it was a tough tradeoff.&#13;
&#13;
On the one hand, by no means do you want everything centralized. That's not a good thing. On&#13;
the other, you needed some mechanism to provide coherence to the process. So ... But the&#13;
period '80 to '87 was Anne Krueger. Anne, who remains a very dear friend and colleague, and&#13;
was one of the key reasons why I came to the Bank, did take the Bank's research program in a&#13;
very specific direction. She had a very clear agenda. She was very much influenced by Deepak&#13;
Lal and what he wanted to do and what he thought was right, and that imprint is all over the&#13;
numbers you cited.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The February 1988 report we just mentioned also addresses a matter of direction&#13;
for the future of Bank research in the post-1987 reorganization era, quote, "The highest priorities&#13;
for current and future research include: one, finding ways for countries to adjust their economies&#13;
and at the same time to sustain growth; two, developing strategies and tools for solving the debt&#13;
problems of highly-indebted countries; three, spurring the development of Sub-Saharan Africa;&#13;
and, four, alleviating poverty.&#13;
&#13;
"Three additional areas that have emerged as new priorities for the Bank, and thus for Bank&#13;
research, are: five, the preservation of the environment; six, the problems and possibilities for&#13;
women in development; and, seven, the best approaches for enlarging the private sector's&#13;
contribution to development.&#13;
&#13;
"Within this broad agenda, the recent evolution of the Bank's lending program points to the need&#13;
for an analysis of the Bank's experience with policy-based lending and the management of&#13;
adjustment programs."&#13;
&#13;
How did these priorities evolve during your period as research administrator? A rather large&#13;
topic there.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: My first reaction is, you could have been reading out a list of issues for today.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                    February 15 and 21 and March 21, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I was thinking the same thing, yes.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: And I think that's the answer to your question. There is little new under the sun. The&#13;
issues-the broad sets of development issues that the Bank has struggled with for years-are still&#13;
here today and were there in 1987. And the list you read is really the list ofkey issues that the&#13;
Bank has been and continues to struggle with, and therefore ought to be the basis for the research&#13;
that we do.&#13;
&#13;
As with most things that we do in the Bank, it's much too broad. We are a victim of the breadth&#13;
of demands on our time, our skills, our staff. I could put that list in front of any current Bank&#13;
staff and say, "Do you think this currently describes the issues that the Bank faces today," and I&#13;
bet you nine out of ten would say yes.&#13;
&#13;
So I think the answer is-what is the right quote? It's always been with us, and always will be.&#13;
So, country assistance strategies have an unfortunate tendency to have the same boxes checked:&#13;
environment, women, private sector development, Africa, poverty, adjustment, growth. That's&#13;
our business. So the criticism of a list like this, as I've said, is it's far too broad to be valuable.&#13;
There's no way of excluding anything-everything fits in this agenda somewhere.&#13;
&#13;
Now, was that a conscious effort? No, but obviously anybody who's putting together a strategy&#13;
for research wants to give himself or herself as much flexibility and wiggle room as possible&#13;
going forward. Later, when you try to align outputs with objectives, you don't want to be to be&#13;
caught out in some way. But looking back on this list, yes, these are the key topics of&#13;
development, and were the key topics of development in 1987.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, some of them emerged-for instance, women in development,&#13;
environment-about 1970 or so.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: This was the beginning ofthe Bank's movement into some of these types of&#13;
issues--environment, women, private sector development. You know, the late [RobertS.]&#13;
McNamara, early [Alden Winship "Tom"] Clausen years were the years when the Bank began&#13;
the move from a project institution to a policy institution. It was, as Ernie [Ernest] Stem argued,&#13;
always doing policy stuff, but the focus became much more clear with structural adjustment.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Not always successfully, though.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: No, not always, maybe not mostly.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That has always been a controversial ...&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Absolutely, and an interesting and long debate. These were issues, almost&#13;
foundational issues of what we deal with. My guess is ten years from now the same list would&#13;
apply.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In which of these priorities was the Bank research most successful and in which&#13;
was it the least successful, in your assessment?&#13;
                                      Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                     February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Bank research? That's a tough question. I don't actually think, without going back&#13;
and looking at what we were doing specifically, I could answer it. The Bank as an institution&#13;
really hasn't had a great deal of success in Africa yet. We still haven't figured out how to solve&#13;
the debt problem, probably because we aren't thinking about it correctly.&#13;
&#13;
The experience in the former Soviet Union suggests we didn't get adjustment and sustainable&#13;
growth right. Poverty will be with us forever. We've probably made some progress on&#13;
environment in the sense of visibility and maybe being a little more tuned to the issue. Women:&#13;
we've done some important work. Private sector development: again, I'm not sure we're&#13;
thinking about it right, but that's a different set of questions.&#13;
&#13;
But I confess it would be hard for me to tell you where research has had the greatest impact. The&#13;
area I know best is our work on poverty, and certainly we've made a notable and noticeable&#13;
contribution to the world's knowledge on poverty. The Bank has really led that work around the&#13;
world, and I take some credit for that. Much of the information that was used for that work came&#13;
out ofthe Living Standards Measurement Study. But maybe I was following that work more&#13;
closely than on other areas.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Did the influx to the Bank of a large number of formerly centrally-planned&#13;
economies, especially those that had been formerly constituent elements of the Soviet Union,&#13;
significantly affect the research program?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: It threw down an enormous gauntlet to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
I remember a wonderful anecdote on that front. It was after Johannes [F.] Linn had been the vice&#13;
president for ECA for some time. There was an event of some sort, and Johannes was talking&#13;
about the mess he found ECA in when he took over. Wilfried [P.] Thalwitz was sitting in the&#13;
audience, the guy who created the mess, and at some point I remember Johannes looking at&#13;
Wilfried and realizing where he was headed and back-peddling-he is a very smart guy-to get&#13;
out of it.&#13;
&#13;
That's a long-winded way of saying that we were scrambling so hard to get traction in an&#13;
incredibly fast-moving environment in the former Soviet Union that I don't think there was much&#13;
research done at all. There was a lot of effort to tap into what we knew on privatization, and so&#13;
forth.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And that didn't go all that well either, in any event.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: No, but this was an unprecedented event, so we really had very little experience to&#13;
follow. As you know, there's been quite a lot of research done since then, the work that ECA has&#13;
done among others, and I think that's good and interesting work.&#13;
&#13;
There was certainly research that went on during that time, but it was more that the new ECA&#13;
just appeared one day.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: One ofthe few Bank reorganizations that I thought made sense.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: They did amazingly. It was, "Throw out the rule book and get it done," and that's&#13;
how they had to do it. You needed tough hombres to do it, and they had the right hombres in&#13;
there. So, no, I don't think there was a major influence on research.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Aprill989 saw the first of the Annual Bank Conferences on Development&#13;
Economics. What was your role in establishing what became a long series of ABCDE&#13;
conferences?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: As I mentioned earlier, Stan Fischer carne up with this idea that it would be good to&#13;
have an event each year, very carefully organized, on a limited number of topics that didn't make&#13;
the same mistakes that most research conferences make, that was designed to showcase what the&#13;
Bank was doing, but also to provide a venue for a real conversation about some of the key issues&#13;
facing development.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What are those mistakes, by the way, briefly?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Conferences are generally incredibly badly managed. People design them on the&#13;
premise that we're spending a lot of money on this, therefore, we have to pack them as full as we&#13;
can. There is never enough time for discussion. There are too many topics, too many speakers,&#13;
no time to explore ideas. ABCDE was designed exactly to avoid those problems.&#13;
&#13;
As I recall, in the days that I was managing it, we would have at least two two-and-a-half-hour&#13;
sessions on every topic, maybe one, two speakers, lots of time for discussion from the audience.&#13;
This did come out of my research background. I had been to lots of conferences, and I found&#13;
most of them boring and frustrating.&#13;
&#13;
Stan was the person that carne up with the name. He loved the ABCDE name, and it stuck. When&#13;
Stan left the Bank, he gave a goodbye speech. I was not present, but the ABCDE was one of the&#13;
successes that he mentioned. He mentioned that, in fact, he and I had done it together, and he&#13;
was very proud of that. He thought it was one of his important legacies.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: As you've mentioned, the ultimate objective of this series is to improve both the&#13;
member country and Bank policyrnaking by enhancing knowledge bases. Do you believe these&#13;
conferences have been successful in that regard?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: I haven't followed them more recently, but I believe they were to start with. I think&#13;
they have now taken on a different role, and one that I am less supportive of.&#13;
&#13;
They take pla,ce now every other year outside of the Bank. That's a contradiction of the ABCDE&#13;
that I was involved in. It was exactly as it states, to 1nforrn Bank staff, so the audience for this&#13;
was Bank staff. It was an intellectual feast that was to take place once a year, open to Bank staff&#13;
in Washington, bring in the best and the brightest, have a real discussion of issues, and energize&#13;
people, get them informed.&#13;

                    February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
You can't do that if it's in St. Petersburg, where you're freezing to death. It's a different&#13;
objective. Good, bad, I don't know, but different. I think it should have stayed focused. Now it&#13;
has become more a showcase outside of the Bank. It's very much a research showcase-rather&#13;
than a way of energizing Bank staff.&#13;
&#13;
There are other events, including the sector weeks, and so forth, that also try to do that. So, as I&#13;
say, the world has changed since then, but I remain convinced that our original notion was the&#13;
right notion.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In 1991 you became the senior economic adviser in the Development Economics&#13;
vice presidency. What occasioned the move from your position as research administrator, and&#13;
what were your primary duties as senior economic adviser?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: In 1991 Larry Summers took over as the Bank's chief economist. In late 1990 I&#13;
went to Stan Fischer and said, "I want to leave the Bank's research administration position and&#13;
move to operations. That's what I came to the Bank to do."&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Oh, so you actually initiated the change to operations?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: I wanted to move out, and I said, "I came here, I served my time, and I want to get&#13;
into operations now."&#13;
&#13;
Stan said to me, "Dennis, would you do me a personal favor? Would you stay one more year?&#13;
Larry needs somebody who understands the Bank and who understands the role of the chief&#13;
economist, and you've worked with two, Anne Krueger and myself, and he's going to need a lot&#13;
of support. Would you stay a year, and then we'll hopefully get some institutional commitment&#13;
to move you into operations."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Sure, but not until I talk to Larry," whom I didn't know. I knew him by reputation, but I'd&#13;
never met him. So I flew up to Cambridge, and we spent an afternoon together, and it was his&#13;
choice. I said, "Larry, it's your call, but Stan said you do need somebody who knows the ropes&#13;
around here."&#13;
&#13;
What were my duties? Well, they certainly weren't to advise Larry on economics. It turned out to&#13;
be a period of-I don't know what the right non-pejorative word is-"educating" Larry on&#13;
working in a bureaucracy.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes, because he had come from an academic environment.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: He was 36, the hottest economist around, the best blood line, et cetera, the youngest&#13;
full professor at Harvard, one of the smartest guys I've ever worked with, but as recent events&#13;
have suggested, not one of the most diplomatic people you will meet.&#13;
&#13;
A lot of my early time with Larry was spent trying to get him to understand that being right&#13;
might be important and might be the name of the game in academics but it was not the name of&#13;
the game in a bureaucracy. To be effective you had to build coalitions. Beating everybody down&#13;

                     February 15 and 21 and March 21, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
by scoring debating points every time you walked into a room was not the way to get people&#13;
committed to your ideas. Whether Larry ever appreciated that, I don't know.&#13;
&#13;
My other main job was to try to get him to dress right. Larry has the kind of figure that doesn't&#13;
hold together, and he was constantly losing his shirt out of the back of his trousers, walking&#13;
around with his jacket on and his white tail behind him. Finally, I bought him a pair of&#13;
suspenders and said, "This is not my job, but why don't you try this for a while?" And he did, to&#13;
his credit. He also then lost them and never wore them again. And I think he then finally found&#13;
somebody who could make him trousers that would stay on.&#13;
&#13;
It was an interesting and slightly stormy relationship. I think I wasn't quite what Larry wanted,&#13;
and it wasn't the job I wanted, but we parted friends, and it was fine. I can't remember who took&#13;
the job after me, but they tended to be more detail-oriented, follow-up people. I'm much more&#13;
conceptual and strategic. That's what I like to do. As I say, Larry and I have remained friends.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I know you have to go very shortly, but we can wind up this session in a moment&#13;
and then proceed on operations next time.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You've already touched on a lot ofthis, but maybe you could make some&#13;
observations or comparisons and contrasts between the senior Bank economists whom you've&#13;
known-Anne Krueger, Stanley Fischer, and Larry Summers-and maybe touch on some of the&#13;
other colleagues who have particularly impressed you during your time in the research complex.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: I was very fortunate to work with an extraordinary group of people. Each had his or&#13;
her strengths and weaknesses, but all of them were open to discussion and ideas, and were&#13;
patient with my idiosyncrasies and inability to keep my mouth shut.&#13;
&#13;
Anne brought me into the Bank. She was always willing to listen, and I was willing to talk. We&#13;
had some pretty strong conversations at times about her approach to the Bank. She was also one&#13;
of those people who didn't fit into the Bank's bureaucracy comfortably. She never quite trusted&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Was she was more comfortable in the Fund, do you think?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Yes, and she is-and she said so to me it was because the Fund is run by&#13;
economists and she understands economists. And she said, "I never really understood the Bank&#13;
because there was nothing that I could get my hands around there." She didn't always have the&#13;
best advice around her in terms of how to deal with bureaucracy. We had many conversations&#13;
about that, and to her credit she was always prepared to listen. I never felt she held any of my&#13;
sometimes fairly strong statements about how she should change against me.&#13;
&#13;
Stan, as I said, was one of the people in the world I have the greatest respect for. He is a true&#13;
gentleman, a great scholar, and a great manager.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: He's, what, governor ofthe Bank of Israel now?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: He is now governor ofthe Bank oflsrael, which I think just speaks volumes for his&#13;
dedication. He left a very influential and lucrative position at Citigroup to become governor.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: And they really didn't want him to leave. He's a committed person, and a very great&#13;
role model.&#13;
&#13;
Larry, as I've said, was at a major transitional point in his life. You know, he was probably the&#13;
wrong person for the position in some ways. He really needed a special assistant to look after&#13;
him, and probably a more junior person would have been better. He is, along with Milton&#13;
Friedman and a few others, among the smartest people I've ever known-fast, great instincts. He&#13;
has a great sense of people. He has huge courage to take on tough issues. He's very committed to&#13;
women, to the environment, things like that, but he will not hide behind politically-correct mush&#13;
statements, for which I respect him enormously. We'll see if he survives the current mess at&#13;
Harvard.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That was a red herring from the beginning.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: There's another one now ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Oh.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: .. more recently that I think is a real problem. He is a person, as I've said, who&#13;
stands behind his principles and is prepared to fight for them even if it means a lot of&#13;
uncomfortableness. He doesn't like to back off of an issue. I have a lot of respect for Larry. I like&#13;
him a lot.&#13;
&#13;
His selection and promotion ofNancy Birdsall, my current boss at the Center for Global&#13;
Development, is an indication of Larry's ability to identify talented people whom other people&#13;
saw as good but never realized that they had the potential that Larry saw in them. Nancy went on&#13;
to do wonderful things and continues to great work today. So, as I say, they were all terrific&#13;
people to work for, and I learned an enormous amount from them. So it was a good time.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Any other colleagues, you know, briefly, at your level, above, below?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: I've got to go, so why don't I think about that and let's make that the opening&#13;
question for the next round?&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Okay, thank you very much.&#13;

[Begin Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Today is February 21, 2006. My name is Charles Ziegler, a consultant for the&#13;
World Bank Group Oral History Program. I have with me here in the World Bank Group&#13;
Archives Mr. Dennis de Tray, for the second session of his oral history interview.&#13;
&#13;
Well, glad to have you back, Dennis. Today we will start with your switch to operations. From&#13;
January 1992 to March 1994, you were the chief, Bolivia, Columbia and the Dominican&#13;
Republic Country Operations Division in the Latin America and Caribbean Region. What were&#13;
the circumstances under which you made the move from research activities to operations?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: When I left the RAND Corporation in '83, it was with the objective of getting into&#13;
operations, but one's past tends to haunt one, so it took me eight years to get out of research and&#13;
into operations.&#13;
&#13;
As we mentioned in the last session, I had agreed to spend my last year out of operations as&#13;
Larry Summers' senior economic adviser and, at the end of that period, began to look for an&#13;
assignment in operations.&#13;
&#13;
I learned quickly that even though I was relatively well known in the Bank and on a first name&#13;
basis with most of the operational VPs [vice presidents], it wasn't that easy to make the switch.&#13;
There were concerns about "you have never done this; therefore, so you can't do it." I was also at&#13;
a fairly senior management level, I guess in that time a grade 25, and operations division chiefs&#13;
were grade 24 mostly.&#13;
&#13;
To cut a long story short, Shahid Husain, for reasons that I am not entirely sure of, agreed to take&#13;
me on and to give me the job that I was looking for, as a country operations division chief.&#13;
&#13;
I wanted something that spanned the spectrum of development issues and was concerned with&#13;
broad strategy of country development rather than a specific sector. I could have gone into, for&#13;
example, the Human Development Division in Latin America but decided against that, and I am&#13;
very pleased I made this decision.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Was Latin America your choice, or was that just what was available?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: It was serendipitous. I didn't speak Spanish, so it wasn't as if it was a natural&#13;
calling. I found Latin America interesting because it spans the range of development challenges,&#13;
and indeed I liked it very much.&#13;
&#13;
There is an interesting similarity to the beginning and end to my operations career. I started in&#13;
operations with three countries that spanned much of the range of development challenges the&#13;
Bank faces as an institution. The Dominican Republic was a relatively low income, difficult&#13;
policy environment, with an autocratic ruler who was not popular internationally. The Bank had&#13;
                                     Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                    February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
a difficult program there and was struggling to find a foothold. Bolivia was and has always been&#13;
a donor darling for the Bank. Enormous amounts of resources have been put into it with not a&#13;
great deal of permanent effect, I think. And Colombia was a middle income country, very&#13;
sophisticated in some respects and facing very serious development challenges in others.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And political challenges, too-just ...&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Serious political challenges. In my last assignment at the Bank in Central Asia I&#13;
faced these same characteristics, and I must say I liked those assignments. It gave me the breadth&#13;
of the perspective of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What were the main challenges in moving from research to operations? You&#13;
mentioned that some people were saying, "Well, you can't do this sort of thing," and, clearly, you&#13;
did. But what were the challenges you faced?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: There were really two. One was, I suppose you might say, a change in mind set. In&#13;
operations you can't just offer advice-on the one hand, on the other. You have to come to a&#13;
decision.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You can't offer advice to whom?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: You can offer advice to countries, but in the end, you are going to be making&#13;
decisions that involve judgments about whether to go forward or not go forward, whether to&#13;
impose a penalty or not.&#13;
&#13;
One of my clearest recollections of my early days in Latin America was two or three weeks after&#13;
I had taken the job, when I was still very much struggling to understand what it was. I had to go&#13;
to Bolivia-to La Paz-to meet with the minister of mines to tell him that we were suspending a&#13;
loan that was designed to close one ofthe major mines in Bolivia-a state enterprise and&#13;
completely uneconomic. The government had reneged on the policy agreement underlying this&#13;
loan, and we were going to cease disbursements on it.&#13;
&#13;
I got down there and, of course, I didn't speak any Spanish, barely knew Bolivia, and certainly&#13;
didn't know the project. I met the minister and said, "It is difficult to be meeting in these&#13;
circumstances." We are working on Bolivia, but in this case, I was bringing bad news, and, of&#13;
course, he knew it was coming.&#13;
&#13;
As we were walking out, I said to the interpreter, "How did it go?"&#13;
&#13;
And she said, "Oh, it went fine."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "It was a little difficult to hear because of all the noise outside." There were all these&#13;
boom, boom, booms.&#13;
&#13;
But she said, "Yes. Those were. the miners."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                     February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I said, "What were they doing?"&#13;
&#13;
She said, "They were throwing sticks of dynamite up in the air as a protest against your visit&#13;
here."&#13;
&#13;
I have to say, to this day that has been a defining moment when I realized the difference between&#13;
doing research and doing operations. In operations you are dealing with real lives, real people,&#13;
real policies, real workers, real conflicts, no first-best solutions, lots of compromise.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The Bolivian miners are pretty tough, too, I understand.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: They were. The Bolivian lower middle class, as we are currently finding out, is&#13;
generally a very tough independent group of people. The miners were indigenous, as opposed to&#13;
of Spanish decent. So they were making themselves known in very obvious ways, which really&#13;
did bring home to me how different operations was to giving advice on research.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In your operations experience, starting with this particular assignment, did you&#13;
actually experience the ways in which Bank research informed the way in which the Bank&#13;
operations were conducted?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Yes, in the sense, in the broad sense that when one was in the process of engaging&#13;
in dialogue with governments, often reticent governments, to try to get them to adopt a policy&#13;
that was perhaps politically unpopular or gored somebody's ox, one did need to have the breadth&#13;
of knowledge that research gives one to make the case that a particular approach that was being&#13;
suggested was based not in ideology but in facts, that there had been lots of experiences like that,&#13;
and that what was being suggested built on those experiences. So in that sense, the knowledge&#13;
generated by research and ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: But the knowledge generated in general or simply, for instance-what I mean is,&#13;
you were pretty much the head man in research when you transferred over. So you would have a&#13;
lot of this in your mind, but say, not you, but, you know, some-a manager, just a normal&#13;
operations manager, without that kind of background, that is what I am really trying to get at. I&#13;
am personally-for not very good reasons, I suppose-somewhat skeptical of how much&#13;
research actually informs operations in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: That is a fair skepticism, and I share it. I believe I mentioned last time that I was&#13;
surprised at how good spending 20 years in research was as a foundation for operations. You&#13;
really do learn a lot, and you have a broad sense of what is important and what is not important.&#13;
A great deal of policy is built on facts and research, but it's the judgment oftradeoffs involved&#13;
that really moves you from the elements of policy research to the elements of policy&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
As I mentioned before, the Bank's research community has not done a particularly good job of&#13;
either codifying the lessons of experience of the Bank in a way that is accessible to ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That is what I'm trying to get at, yes.&#13;
                                     Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                    February 15 and 21 and March 21, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: ... overworked Bank managers or, indeed, to extract from the more cutting edge&#13;
types of research that academia does, or the Bank sometimes does, the implications for&#13;
operations.&#13;
&#13;
We spend a lot of money on doing what is technically good analytic work, but far, far too little&#13;
money in disseminating it. And that doesn't mean doing conferences or writing volumes. It&#13;
means figuring out how to make it accessible to the clients who we are trying to serve. And&#13;
oftentimes these are country clients, but very frequently they are Bank clients, operations clients.&#13;
&#13;
 ZIEGLER: It is the accessibility I am thinking about, because, of course, I never worked in&#13;
 operations, but I have known people who have, and these are busy people. They don't have time&#13;
Â·to go through stacks and stacks of research reports. They need fairly small, bite-size pieces of&#13;
 knowledge, so to speak.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: There are two sides to that coin. On the one hand, I don't think there is enough&#13;
oversight and incentive on the operations side to get over-taxed task managers to actually seek&#13;
the knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
There are processes that try to do it, but they do it, I find, in an artificial way. But much more&#13;
importantly, the unmitigated truth of what has gone before is often difficult to find.&#13;
&#13;
We are an institution that is both judge and jury, and oftentimes the judge is a part of another&#13;
jury, and so forth. So you get, not intentional conflicts of interest, but groups of expertise for&#13;
whom it is in their self-interest to see the glass as half full.&#13;
&#13;
In much of our institutional development work-public sector reform work-the track record is&#13;
pretty abysmal, and yet you don't hear enough up-front criticism of trying to do the same old&#13;
thing again and again when you get those people together and have them review a new project or&#13;
a new policy stance.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What were the main issues that you had to address in the&#13;
countries covered by your division in Latin America?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Colombia was precursor to the whole middle income debate going on right now.&#13;
How do you work in a country that is both technically quite sophisticated-! mean, our&#13;
counterparts there were, in many respects, better economists than we were, very bright people.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Were they U.S. educated?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Yes, in the best universities, and some very, very good people, often with a lot more&#13;
experience than certainly I was bringing to the operational table at the time, in a very politicized&#13;
environment that was struggling with the drug issue, with the guerillas and so on.&#13;
&#13;
A new oil field in Cusiana was just coming online that had the potential to create "Dutch&#13;
Disease" problems in Colombia. So they were interested in technical advice and in some money,&#13;
                                      Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                     February 15 and 21 and March 21, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
but the money was really secondary. But they were interested ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Technical advice.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: .. they were interested in the best technical advice. So I was able, for example, to&#13;
bring, interestingly, Indonesian experts in to tell them how Indonesia managed its oil reserve.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: We were talking about Colombia and their excellent economists.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Right. A key to success in Colombia was the ability to bring in people that had ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You had an Indonesian expert.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: .. similar experiences on the oil revenue front. I must say, I respect the Colombians&#13;
because Indonesia was, in some respects, a less developed country than Colombia, but Indonesia&#13;
did very well in managing their oil resources, and the Colombians wanted to know how that&#13;
happened.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That is interesting. Given the known corruption in Indonesia, they still managed to&#13;
do a decent job with their oil.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: I'll come to that later. They did one of the best jobs managing their oil.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, Bolivia was a long-term development challenge, everything from infrastructure to&#13;
human development, an IDA country, resource-constrained, difficult political circumstances in&#13;
the sense of a division between the elites and the indigenous Bolivians, a country that had a very&#13;
up-and-down history: hyperinflation, military dictatorships.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Political instability.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: And when I got there, it had come out of most of that, and was on relatively benign&#13;
path.&#13;
&#13;
As I stated, the Dominican Republic was a country run by. a dictator. A challenge to figure out&#13;
how to operate, and what sectors in which we could do some good without doing harm.&#13;
&#13;
So that assignment spanned a range of, I think, development challenges.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Were there any persons with whom you dealt in those countries who made a&#13;
particularly strong impression on you? You mentioned, for instance, some of the economists in&#13;
Colombia. Anybody in particular that stands out in your mind?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: I remember the minister of finance, Rudi [Rudolf] Holmes, from whom I learned a&#13;
great deal. I know it is supposed to be the other way around. He was U.S. trained, might have&#13;
                                     Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                    February 15 and 21 and March 21, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
even been from my alma mater, Chicago, but I don't think so, but maybe. Very smart guy, very&#13;
savvy politically.&#13;
&#13;
Let's see, in '92, I would have been in my late 40s and Rudi was probably a decade older, and it&#13;
showed. He had been in this business a long time. He was very tolerant of the advice we would&#13;
give, often smiled quietly, but, you know, he could have been on either side of the table.&#13;
&#13;
I suppose in Bolivia there was a whole group of people whose names I am not going to&#13;
remember who were there when I first arrived. There was bunch of others, Goni [Gonzalo]&#13;
Sanchez de Losada. Goni, who was an American-raised Bolivian, spoke Spanish with an&#13;
American accent. A real character, but was a duly-elected Bolivian. He put together a very good&#13;
technocratic government. We brought them to the Bank for almost a week and put them through&#13;
a course on development, about what needs to be done, about what we knew about the Bolivian&#13;
economy and so forth. An amazingly productive and useful week, and very good people to work&#13;
with.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: From April 1994 to March 1999 you served, first, as director, resident staff in&#13;
Indonesia, and then country director for Indonesia. In both cases, you resided in Jakarta. What&#13;
were the circumstances that led to this appointment?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Again, I owe it to Shahid Husain, who by that time had left LAC and was the vice&#13;
president for personnel, an interesting appointment for Shahid.&#13;
&#13;
While I had been country operations division chief I had done a couple of country assistance&#13;
strategies that caught Shahid's eye. One of them he sent around and said, "This is what I want to&#13;
see in other countries."&#13;
&#13;
So he seemed to like the way I did business, and at one point he called me up in early 1994 and Â·&#13;
said, "Dennis, I have an opening that I would like you to take. It is to run the Bank's liaison&#13;
office in London."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Shahid, my wife is going to kill me, but I didn't come to the Bank to go to London. I&#13;
really came to the Bank for development, and I'm not so sure I would be good at the liaison job&#13;
anyway."&#13;
&#13;
External relations liaison requires one to be "on message," and I am not a very good "on&#13;
message" person. I tend to say what I believe, and sometimes that is not the right way to make&#13;
progress.&#13;
&#13;
So I turned him down. About a week or two later, he called me and he said, "Okay. I have got&#13;
another assignment for you." He said, "There are three major country offices opening up, Delhi,&#13;
Dhaka and Jakarta. Which one of those would you be interested in?"&#13;
&#13;
So I did some quick research and, historically, Indonesia had been one of the Bank's premier&#13;
field assignments, as had the other two. But most importantly, I had a son then who was just&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                     30 .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
best in the world. So I said I was interested in Jakarta, and they went through the process. And at&#13;
that time Marianne Haug was the country director. I met with Marianne. She didn't object. I don't&#13;
know if she cared. And so I got the assignment.&#13;
&#13;
I got the offer on a Friday, and I went home and told my family that this was the best overseas&#13;
assignment I was ever going to be offered with the Bank. So we had a fundamental decision to&#13;
make. Were we ever going to go overseas or were we not? I said to my wife and my one son who&#13;
was home at that point, "Think about it overnight. I have a job I love, my life will go on, it is not&#13;
a problem, but this is an opportunity."&#13;
&#13;
So the next morning, my son came to me, he was a freshman, and said, "Dad, I have a strong&#13;
sense I am not going to like this, but I think it is the right thing to do." This is a very mature thing&#13;
to say for a freshman in high school.&#13;
&#13;
My wife, who was at that point running her own catering firm here, also agreed it was probably&#13;
an opportune time to leave, although she didn't really want to shut her business down.&#13;
&#13;
So we agreed as a family to do it, and on that Monday I said yes.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You were one ofthe first ofthe new-style decentralized country department&#13;
directors. How did it feel to be such a pioneer?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: It was an interesting issue because ofthe particular nature of the Jakarta office. The&#13;
director of the resident staff in Jakarta, while not the country director ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: At that time.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: .. at that-when I first started ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: . :had an enormous amount of autonomy and authority anyways, but ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And had for a long time, starting with Bernie [Bernard R.] Bell, I think.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Bernie Bell was a vice president, and he was the first "country director" for&#13;
Indonesia. There was a decline over time of the status of the job as country directors migrated to&#13;
Washington, or were in Washington and pulled back the authority that the country managers and&#13;
country directors had had in the field.&#13;
&#13;
But nonetheless, because of the size of the office and the 12-hour time difference, there was a lot&#13;
of authority. It is a great assignment, even as director of the resident staff.&#13;
&#13;
I had a rather unusual ",.,.. ,.... ..-.. .,                                                good&#13;
instincts in development,                                                                  There was&#13;
a sort of odd and never quite clear division of labor.&#13;
                                      Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                     February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Along came the '97 reorganization and Jean-Michel Severino, who was the vice president and&#13;
himself quite new in the Region. I was one of two c&lt;;mntry managers, or whatever you want to&#13;
call them, who were in situ, and who were given the director assignments without going through&#13;
the competitive process.&#13;
&#13;
I wanted it very badly. I had invested three years in Indonesia and I wanted another two. So I&#13;
was very pleased, very happy to get the assignment. It was extremely exciting. I was very, very&#13;
much committed to decentralization and to the value of being in the field, and my time in&#13;
Indonesia had done nothing but convince me that that was the right way to do development.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Was your family enjoying it at that point?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Very much. I have come to decide moving has three phases no matter where you&#13;
move. When we moved from California to here, it was the same thing.&#13;
&#13;
For the first year, your family barely speaks to you. For the second year, they sort of think it is&#13;
okay. By the third year, they don't want to leave, and, the fourth year, they don't even want to&#13;
talk about leaving.&#13;
&#13;
So the first year was a bit tough. My wife had given up her business. She had to learn how to&#13;
reintegrate herself into a community, which she does magnificently now. She became involved&#13;
in culture and heritage, and eventually became the president of the Indonesian Heritage Society&#13;
and left a real impact on Jakarta.&#13;
&#13;
My son, within three or four weeks of starting at JIS [Jakarta International School], liked the&#13;
environment, liked the friends, got into varsity soccer, became, eventually, president of the&#13;
school.&#13;
&#13;
It was terrific for all of us. The last two years were a little tough, as we will get to, but as a&#13;
family experience, we all look back on it as extremely positive because it was a life-changing&#13;
expenence.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: How would you characterize the day-to-day relations between the country office&#13;
and headquarters? And, presumably, this would have changed somewhat from your initial&#13;
assignment there, which was just as head of the resident office, and then becoming country&#13;
director.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: One of the aspects of the Bank decentralization that I have learned--and we will get&#13;
to the other side of this when we get to my last assignment--is that when you are dealing with a&#13;
large country that is a major element of the Bank's overall portfolio, a country that has attracted&#13;
the best and the brightest in the Bank for many years, as a decentralized country director, you&#13;
have the best of both worlds.&#13;
&#13;
You are in the country, dealing with the government on a day-to-day basis, on the one hand; on&#13;
the other, the Bank comes to you. You are too important, you are too attractive as a program to&#13;
                                      Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                     February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ignore. It was easy to get good people to work on Indonesia. People call you up and say, "Can I&#13;
come work in your country?" So in some ways managing the Bank side of the matrix was not a&#13;
problem.&#13;
&#13;
Even so, I don't think I did it as well as I should have. I had a very good country program&#13;
coordinator Oscar de Bruyn Kops, who was my alter egoin Washington, but I did learn that&#13;
managing Washington is a real challenge.&#13;
&#13;
You have a tremendous sense of esprit de corps and team in Jakarta, but transferring that to&#13;
Washington turns out to be really difficult, because you are not there, because of the 12-hour&#13;
time difference. Unless you decide to stay up every night until midnight, you really don't interact&#13;
with Washington as much as you would like to.&#13;
&#13;
And when you are back in Washington, you are usually back running to meetings and other&#13;
Board events that keep you very, very busy. So you don't have the "corridor time" that you have&#13;
if you are stationed in Washington.&#13;
&#13;
And while I was aware it was a problem, until the crisis hit I didn't realize how serious a problem&#13;
this was. And until I got to Central Asia, I didn't realize how different it is for a large country&#13;
than for small countries.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: How would you characterize your relations with local staff and what were their&#13;
main concerns? Because it is quite an extensive locally-recruited staff there, as I recall.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: The Jakarta office was one ofthe oldest offices in the Bank's country office system.&#13;
It had recruited a number of very good local staff along the way, who had worked their way into&#13;
positions of confidence and respect with Washington staff.&#13;
&#13;
Nonetheless, one of the great challenges that I saw was that these really good country staff were&#13;
not being used to their full potential. There- was still too much of a sense that they were in service&#13;
in support of Washington-based task team leaders.&#13;
&#13;
They had capacities to do, for example, "continuous supervision." They knew Indonesian, they&#13;
knew the country, they knew the culture, they could really do it, and often they knew what was&#13;
going on under the surface much better than our international staff did.&#13;
&#13;
One of the obsessions that I have had since I became a decentralized country director is to try to&#13;
get the Bank to give more authority to national staff. In those days, it was "we can't do this&#13;
because they are going to come under pressure from friends and relatives"-the corruption issue.&#13;
I didn't see it. What I saw were a group of people that took corruption much more seriously than&#13;
we did because it was their country. So I have always been a great believer in giving national&#13;
staff more authority.&#13;
&#13;
It also was a period that really shaped my perspective on decentralization, when I began to&#13;
realize that the real problem with decentralization is not its cost but the cost of Washington.&#13;
Washington was a very expensive place. For decentralization to work there had to be a transfer&#13;
                                      Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                     February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  33&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
of responsibilities to field offices and a concomitant reduction in international staff in&#13;
Washington to offset the costs of those transfers.&#13;
&#13;
The reason that decentralization is seen as expensive is because the second never happens. You&#13;
basically build up more capacity in the country offices but you don't reduce capacity in&#13;
headquarters. That is by definition cost-enhancing and is not going to work.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I remember when I visited the Jakarta office-this was 1997--one of the concerns&#13;
expressed by the local staff was the quality of medical care. They were all-I shouldn't say all,&#13;
but there was a hope that there would be more ability to go to places like Singapore for serious&#13;
medical treatment, if necessary.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: This was before the "one staff' policy.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes. Yes, it was.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: That was one ofthe more serious elements ofthe different treatment of&#13;
international staff and national staff. It was never an easy issue. We hire in local labor markets.&#13;
The question is, did we also provide benefits based on the local labor markets. The Bank is a&#13;
very good employer in Washington and a very good employer in Jakarta for its national staff. I&#13;
am not sure I can remember the incident, but that when it was deemed essential, we would send&#13;
even national staff to Singapore, if we thought the health services were not adequate.&#13;
&#13;
One of the challenges of being a decentralized country director is that sometimes you have to&#13;
make decisions in an hour that you would love to have some advice on. I remember that one of&#13;
our colleague's wife got very sick and ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: National staff?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: No. International staff. I authorized her MEDEVAC [medical evacuation] at a very&#13;
significant expense in a matter of hours; on the basis of a doctor in Jakarta. The doctors in&#13;
Singapore said that another 24 hours and she might not have made it. You have to make those&#13;
kinds of decisions along the way. I guess that is what you get paid for.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The Strategic Compact was implemented in early 1997. Under the Compact, an&#13;
additional $100 million was authorized in each ofFY-98 and FY-99, with an additional $50&#13;
million in FY-2000. Also, there was to be a return by FY-01 to the FY-97 net administrative&#13;
budget level, in real terms, subject to dem~nd for the Bank's approved products and services.&#13;
&#13;
Under the Strategic Compact, there were to be better project results ratings, more resources&#13;
devoted to front line efforts, that is to say, 60/40 compared to 50150; new products, relevant and&#13;
timely; greater technical expertise; further decentralization to country offices; and a world class&#13;
knowledge management system, among other things. The Bank was to be faster and&#13;
organizationally flatter, lower cost, more efficient and flexible, with a better trained staff.&#13;
&#13;
That is quite an order. Did the Strategic Compact have any effect on your work in Indonesia?&#13;

                     February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: The Strategic Compact was agreed to in 19 ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Around February-the first half of 1997.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: The simple answer is very little, but the reason is important. (I have views on the&#13;
Compact, but that is a separate set of issues.) For my program in Indonesia, first, I was there&#13;
during the money phase of the Compact and not during the reduction phase.&#13;
&#13;
By the time the Compact was beginning to take effect in FY98, the Indonesian crisis was under&#13;
way. No Compact, nothing but that crisis mattered for the next two years, until I left in April of&#13;
'99. So in that sense, it didn't play a very large role, and I really didn't follow the debate much&#13;
because I had many other things on my agenda.&#13;
&#13;
I was always a bit puzzled by the agenda, by the Compact. As I mentioned earlier, I think one of&#13;
the great flaws in the process of decentralization is that the Bank never understood that there had&#13;
to be fewer staff in Washington in order to make it budget neutral. And when the people&#13;
managing the staff are sitting in Washington next to the people who have to go, there is no way&#13;
they are going to let that happen.&#13;
&#13;
So it was a serious conflict of interest in the way the decentralization process was set up. You&#13;
had a budget debate taking place in Washington, with all the special interests in the Bank,&#13;
virtually completely outside the sphere of influence of decentralized country directors. We were&#13;
not even at the table for the serious budget discussions.&#13;
&#13;
What you got is a Compact that didn't deliver on what it was supposed to deliver on, which is a&#13;
leaner, more efficient, more effective Bank. It didn't deliver on a sustainable decentralization&#13;
process. It should have produced more decentralization, not less. It basically created a debt for&#13;
the institution with the Board that we were constantly trying to defend.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The day after you took up your post in Indonesia can be said to mark the beginning&#13;
of the East Asia financial crisis, for on that day Thailand abandoned its longstanding policy of&#13;
pegging its currency, the Thai baht, to the dollar. This crisis, of course, very soon engulfed&#13;
Indonesia, even though it had been held up as an exemplary model of development for many&#13;
years by the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
A little over a year later, a World Bank document entitled Indonesia in Crisis: A Macroeconomic&#13;
Update, dated July 16, 1998, assesses the situation in Indonesia at that point:&#13;
&#13;
       Indonesia is in deep crisis, but words alone cannot describe the numbing shock that has&#13;
       been inflicted on this country of 200 million people, the fourth largest country in the&#13;
       world.&#13;
&#13;
       Just a year ago, Indonesia was enjoying its 30th year of virtually uninterrupted rapid&#13;
       growth. Investors were beating a path to its door, demanding to participate and contribute&#13;
       to its growing prosperity.&#13;
                                     Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                    February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      35&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Inflation was low, foreign exchange reserves plentiful, and the government budget in&#13;
       surplus. The comforting proximity of other booming East Asian economies generated&#13;
       synergies for Indonesia through trade and capital flows.&#13;
&#13;
       These, mixed with high levels of domestic savings and investment, promised little&#13;
       interruption to continued rapid development and poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
       Within the space of one year, Indonesia has seen its currency fall in value by 80 percent,&#13;
       inflation soar to over 50 percent, the economy swing from rapid growth to even more&#13;
       rapid contraction, unemployment climb rapidly, and the stock exchange lose much of its&#13;
       value.&#13;
&#13;
       Foreign creditors have withdrawn. Investors have retreated. Capital and entrepreneurs&#13;
       have fled. Longstanding defects in governance, earlier camouflaged by rapid growth,&#13;
       have now been unasked as fatal flaws.&#13;
&#13;
       Unfortunately, the crisis hit when Indonesia was experiencing its worst drought in 50&#13;
       years and the international oil price was registering a sharp decline.&#13;
&#13;
       Social unrest and erupted and shaken to its very core the political stability of the nation.&#13;
       Years of development and poverty reduction are at risk.&#13;
&#13;
       No country in recent history, let alone one the size oflndonesia, has&#13;
       ever suffered such a dramatic reversal of fortune.&#13;
&#13;
Not a very auspicious beginning to your tenure in Indonesia. What actions were taken by the&#13;
World Bank to address the crisis in Indonesia?&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: We were just talking about the situation in Indonesia and what actions were taken&#13;
by the World Bank to address the financial crisis there.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: I think to understand the Bank's program you have to understand that the crisis can&#13;
be seen as having three phases: an early macroeconomic phase, a middle and critical credibility&#13;
phase-like the better title-and a rebuilding or restructuring phase to try to hold the country&#13;
together as the crisis burned itself out.&#13;
&#13;
In the early phase oflndonesia's crisis, that is, following the devaluation of the Thai baht, many&#13;
observers, and I was one of them, thought Indonesia was not going to be seriously affected by&#13;
the crisis. I don't think anybody thought the East Asian crisis was going to evolve into what it&#13;
did.&#13;
&#13;
Peter [L.] Woicke, who used to be the head of the IFC [International Finance Corporation], was,&#13;
at that point, a banker in Singapore. And Peter told me later that his bank, Standard Charter, as I&#13;

recall, was betting on the continued strength of the rupiah through the end of August.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That is the Indonesian currency.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Yes. The rupiah, the Indonesian currency, through the end of August 1997.&#13;
&#13;
There was nothing in the macroeconomic management of this country that suggested a serious&#13;
economic crisis in the offing, and, indeed, this was not primarily a public macroeconomic crisis.&#13;
It was a private debt crisis, if you will, a private sector crisis.&#13;
&#13;
In the first phase a contagion began to take place, and East Asian countries generally began to be&#13;
affected by the notion that just maybe East Asia's time had come and things were going to&#13;
decline, that people were way overexposed in East Asia, something we had warned against.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: When you say "people" you mean outside investors.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Private, outside investors. The rate of foreign direct investment into Indonesia had&#13;
always been high, but had accelerated at an increasing rate throughout 1996 and 1997-take it&#13;
from January 1997 to July 1997. There was no sense that the private sector detected the crisis in&#13;
the making in Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
Now, that was not true in Thailand. The Thais had a problem that was well known then and later&#13;
analyzed many times.&#13;
&#13;
As the contagion started to affect Indonesia, the initial reaction was to see this as essentially a&#13;
macroeconomic crisis. That's the territory of the IMF.&#13;
&#13;
Professor Nitsastro Widjojo, who was, and still is, the architect of Indonesia's enormously&#13;
successful growth period from 1966 to 1996, and I spent many, many hours talking about what to&#13;
do with that crisis. It was interesting that I was, at that particular point in time, without a lead&#13;
economist. So I was playing that role, as well. And Widjojo and the minister of finance, Mari&#13;
Muhammed, and Ali Wardhana, another adviser to the president, were all engaged in daily&#13;
conversations about what to do.&#13;
&#13;
The initial reaction of the government was basically to out-Fund the Fund. It raised interest rates&#13;
very high by taking liquidity out of the banking system-all of the standard recommendations&#13;
the Fund would have brought, had it been there, in order to strengthen the rupiah. If you don't&#13;
have rupiah liquidity, you can't buy dollars and, therefore, you can't depreciate the rupiah and&#13;
appreciate the dollar.&#13;
&#13;
Even with all these really quite draconian measures on the part of the Indonesian government,&#13;
the rupiah continued to slide, and nobody quite knew why. I think it all has to do with the second&#13;
part of the agenda, the credibility side, which we will get to in a moment.&#13;
&#13;
In the end it was agreed, and Widjojo, with my concurrence, agreed that we would ask the Fund&#13;
to come and do an analysis. And the rationale was that the Fund would be able to certify that&#13;
                                      Dennis N. de Tray&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
what the government was doing was correct and give it credibility, thereby providing confidence&#13;
to the foreign exchange market, reducing pressure on the rupiah.&#13;
&#13;
The first Fund team that came was headed by Bijan Aghevli, and he immediately began to&#13;
develop a program that was aimed at the governance side of the agenda, the corruption and&#13;
cronyism. They did this in complete isolation from the World Bank, something that I have been&#13;
extremely vocal about and was vocal about then. It wasn't that we thought it was right or wrong.&#13;
We just weren't consulted. And the Fund hadn't been seriously in Indonesia for something like 17&#13;
years.&#13;
&#13;
Cutting a long story short, the main part of this program was the reform of the banking system, in&#13;
which the IMP was going to close insolvent and illiquid banks. That proved to be a major error&#13;
on the part of the Fund, and I think is recognized as such now because, of course, they ended up&#13;
closing far too few banks. There was a run on the banks that were left, causing a banking crisis.&#13;
There was no Plan B, and this was a highly predictable event.&#13;
&#13;
A key question that I think remains far too little understood is why the initial macroeconomic&#13;
program that the government implemented didn't work. I think the answer lies in something that&#13;
is outside of economics. Nineteen ninety-seven had been a year of when almost all Indonesians,&#13;
the Javanese particularly, saw serious "spiritual" signals that Suharto was perhaps coming to the&#13;
end of his god-given right to rule. Even some very well-educated Javanese saw Suharto as a&#13;
Javanese king and Javanese kings ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: As opposed to a simple military dictator.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Very much so. Javanese kings were either given the spiritual authority to rule, or&#13;
didn't have it. There was no half-way house.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The Chinese have something like that, too.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Very similar. There had been, as I recall, two or three major airplane crashes. There&#13;
had been major fires, a serious drought, and a series of things that people were beginning to&#13;
interpret as signals from on high that the end was near. That was part of the beginning of the end&#13;
of Suharto's absolute authority over Indonesia. Once it became accepted in the minds of&#13;
Indonesians that Suharto's time was over, the crisis was simply a matter oftime.&#13;
&#13;
You have to remember Indonesia's history. The last time there was a change in presidency in&#13;
Indonesia, in 1965, between Sukarno and Suharto, nearly half a million people died. There were&#13;
many, many people in Indonesia in 1997 who remembered that. They remembered it very&#13;
clearly. The ethnic Chinese remembered it particularly clearly because many of their relatives&#13;
ended up being killed during that period.&#13;
&#13;
As the crisis continued it became a self-fulfilling prophecy. The Indonesians began to believe&#13;
that Suharto no longer had the capacity to rule. They lost confidence in Suharto and in his&#13;
economic management and in the rupiah.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                    February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This was, and is, an open economy. The first thing they wanted to do was get out of the rupiah&#13;
and into something safer-to move into dollars. Every day in which there was a little more&#13;
uncertainty and a little more pressure on the rupiah convinced Indonesians, particularly the&#13;
ethnic Chinese, that the likelihood of the transition out of the Suharto regime was increasing.&#13;
That brought with it the prospect of a very, very painful and serious disruption in not just the&#13;
Indonesian economy but the Indonesian society, as happened 30 years before.&#13;
&#13;
So what took place was a series of programs managed by the IMF. I, as the Bank's country&#13;
director, recognized from day one the Fund's presence there, that you can only have one leader&#13;
in the crisis and the Fund is that leader. But as I said, I simply couldn't understand why they&#13;
weren't more interested in understanding our perspectives and tapping into our knowledge, but&#13;
they were very secretive and very Fund-like.&#13;
&#13;
I happened to have an open access to Stan Fischer, who was the First Deputy Managing Director&#13;
then.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I think you had mentioned last time that you had known him very well.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Stan had been a postdoc at Chicago when I was getting my degree there in the late&#13;
'60s and early '70s, and we have remained friends ever since. I had served as his research&#13;
administrator when he was the Bank's chief economist. I have a great deal of respect to him, and&#13;
I guess he had some respect for me.&#13;
&#13;
So at some point in December of '97 I sent Stan the only personal e-mail I sent him during the&#13;
crisis, in which I said, "This is simply unacceptable and unbelievable. I wouldn't care if it was&#13;
just me who was being essentially ignored. This is bad for Indonesia and I won't accept it. Bijan&#13;
and his team are not taking advantage of the in-depth knowledge that the World Bank has of this&#13;
country, both politically and economically, and that is leading up to a great many mistakes. We&#13;
need a better partnership in this. You guys can continue to lead, but you need to draw us in."&#13;
&#13;
Stan wrote back and said he understood, and he would see what he could do. That was very late&#13;
in December.&#13;
&#13;
On the eighth of January, which is my birthday, the rupiah had one of its most serious crisis&#13;
days. It dropped something like 50 percent in a few hours.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: This is 1998?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: In 1998. There was, for the first time in the crisis, panic in the streets of Jakarta. All&#13;
the shops were stripped of everything, especially food items. It was the day when I actually&#13;
became seriously concerned about the complete collapse of Indonesia, concerned that the place&#13;
could really, really come apart in a 1965 sense, that there would be massive killings and lootings.&#13;
&#13;
Within three days, by the 11th of January, Stan Fischer was in Indonesia. Stan Fischer was the&#13;
best person the Fund had for this kind of activity. And Stan and Hubert Nice, who was the&#13;
Director for East Asia, which is the vice president level in the Fund, arrived and took over the&#13;
                                     Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                    February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
program. And Stan remained engaged at a very intimate level from then on, although&#13;
Hubert ran the program and spent a great deal of time in Indonesia. He virtually lived there for&#13;
the next year, 1998.&#13;
&#13;
I met with Hubert and Stan for a couple of hours when they had arrived, and we talked through&#13;
the program and the issues. And then Stan took me into his room and he sat me down and said,&#13;
"Okay, Dennis, tell me what you really think."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Stan, what I really think is that there is nothing that you or I could do. This is not an&#13;
economic crisis. We just don't have the tools. We don't have the instruments to help. This is a&#13;
crisis of confidence in Suharto. It is deeply Javanese, deeply Indonesian, deeply historical,&#13;
deeply cultural. My personal view is that there is nothing that we can do short of waiting for Mr.&#13;
Suharto to leave that is going to end this crisis. But we are obligated by our institutional&#13;
mandates to do something, and the best I can suggest is that we convince Suharto that he needs a&#13;
serious reform package." Every reform package that the IMF had offered had failed to surprise&#13;
the markets, and without that surprise, the decline of the rupiah continued. We needed a program&#13;
that really shocked the market. I said, "Either Suharto has to signal that he gets it now and is&#13;
prepared to change the way he does business, or he has to go.':&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And he hadn't gotten it up to that point.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: No, not at all. So we put together a program that basically attacked all of the sacred&#13;
cows in unison: the car factory, the clove monopoly that his son had, the airplane factory, a&#13;
whole bunch of things.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: These were all run by Suharto's cronies or his family.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: His cronies or his children. They were actually relatively unimportant in an&#13;
economic sense, but in the form of signals they were critical.&#13;
&#13;
We helped put together this package with Stan and his staff. They led it, but we provided most of&#13;
the inputs into it.&#13;
&#13;
And there was the famous signing ceremony in which [Michel] Camdessus was pictured with his&#13;
arms folded, standing over Suharto, for which I blame Suharto's staff. Camdessus was&#13;
completely innocent. He was just standing there, trying to helpful. He happens to be French. He&#13;
happened to cross his arms. He happened not to have read Culture Shock!: Indonesia [1986] and&#13;
didn't know that was a bad thing to do, and Suharto was below him, which is bad. Javanese&#13;
kings always have to be above you. Indonesia is a country that is very spiritual, both very much&#13;
the way it was five hundred years ago and very modem. So it is a wonderful mix.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I remember the photograph, and it looks like the "strict schoolmaster and the erring&#13;
student" pose.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: The signing should have never been arranged that way. I mean, I heard from a&#13;
number of sources that it was something that Camdessus really grew to almost detest because it&#13;
                                     Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                    February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
was such an innocent gesture on his part and so much was read into it. It really haunted him for&#13;
many, many years.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And he is a pretty smooth operator, too. He doesn't put a foot wrong very often.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: That is why I think this was so frustrating because he didn't think he put a foot&#13;
wrong. He had come out to add his weight to what was seen as the ultimate program for&#13;
Indonesia. So that was a bad start.&#13;
&#13;
The signing took place, I think, on a Friday morning. We went back to the office. Of course, we&#13;
were watching by the minute the rupiah. It appreciated several hundred rupiah, five or six&#13;
hundred, quite quickly. We were ecstatic. We went out to celebrate and have a beer. By the time&#13;
we got back to the office, it was already down below its morning start. So it hadn't even lasted an&#13;
afternoon. Why? Because the Indonesian people knew what we didn't know, which was that&#13;
Suharto had no intention of actually doing any of what the package promised. He apparently told&#13;
his cabinet in a closed session that, "Don't worry about it; we will take care of this later." They&#13;
didn't believe him because he wasn't believable.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: "They" meaning the Indonesian people.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: The Indonesian people, particularly the ethnic Chinese. And without their belief,&#13;
the crisis continued.&#13;
&#13;
By this time, international capital was either stuck in Jakarta or gone. Any subsequent declines in&#13;
the rupiah were all domestically driven, with the Chinese rushing to get money out. And indeed,&#13;
the crisis, as it worsened in late December through early January, was virtually all the Chinese&#13;
taking their money to Singapore. They were the big money holders there. They knew how to&#13;
work the system. They knew how to get money out of the central bank. There was a huge run on&#13;
the central bank. And before the Fund got its act together and figured out that there was a run on&#13;
the central bank, hundreds of millions, billions of dollars were taken out. The effect on the rupiah&#13;
and on inflation is well known.&#13;
&#13;
When that package failed, it was really just a matter of a holding action until the politics played&#13;
itself out. We went through a phase when the government was seriously considering Steve [H.]&#13;
Hanke's currency board recommendation.&#13;
&#13;
Hanke was selling a bill of goods to the government, but for a couple of months, which was an&#13;
eternity in this period, there was virtually no dialogue between ourselves, the IMF, and the&#13;
government because we simply wouldn't accept that they were going to adopt this principle. A&#13;
currency board would have been a disaster. None of the precursors to a successful currency&#13;
board existed in Jakarta at the time, and most currency boards have failed over time anyway. So&#13;
it wasn't a great idea.&#13;
&#13;
But, anyway, negotiations stopped again. There was another election. The "crony" cabinet came,&#13;
which was another signal that the end game was moving forward.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                    February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Suharto was pulling back into his history. He surrounded himself by people that he trusted. Bob&#13;
[Mohamad] Hasan [The Kian Seng] became minister of trade. Bob Hasan was the plywood&#13;
baron who had run the plywood industry and was a billionaire several times over, essentially&#13;
Suharto's money man. He was ethnic Chinese, but very smart, very rich, very smooth, and very&#13;
dependent on Suharto.&#13;
&#13;
Suharto's genius was to create balance between the ethnic Chinese, who had the wealth, the&#13;
ethnic Indonesians, who had voting power, and the military. He was able to give all of them&#13;
enough independence and power so that nobody rocked the boat. That was his genius in creating&#13;
a stable and very successful economy over a period of 30 years.&#13;
&#13;
So, the crony cabinet came in, and things continued to deteriorate. There was an effort to begin&#13;
to resolve the private debt issue, which was the core of the restructuring problem.&#13;
&#13;
The real economic flaw in Indonesia was not macroeconomic management but the fact that the&#13;
private sector was borrowing offshore in dollars to invest in projects in Indonesia that generated&#13;
revenues in rupiah-and often they were borrowing relatively short-term for the long-term&#13;
investments. So there was a currency and time mismatch because they had never had any&#13;
problem rolling over borrowing. They borrowed in dollars. They didn't hedge. Revenues were in&#13;
rupiah. So a ten percent decline in the rupiah was like a ten percent increase in their dollar debt,&#13;
and an 80 percent decline in the rupiah essentially bankrupted the country.&#13;
&#13;
So all rules were off. The banking system was illiquid and insolvent, but not because they were&#13;
holding lots of offshore dollar debt. They were insolvent because they held rupiah debt that was&#13;
held by corporations that were now bankrupt. The system was in complete paralysis. And one of&#13;
the really difficult challenges, which we never really figured out how to do, was how to create a&#13;
way out of this, how to create the equivalent of a functioning bankruptcy process in Indonesia&#13;
that would allow debtors and creditors to negotiate the settlements needed to get the economy&#13;
going again. It just turned out to be virtually impossible.&#13;
&#13;
In May the serious challenges to Suharto began, as did perhaps the most difficult professional&#13;
time I have ever had. Things had been tough up to that point, in no small part because it was&#13;
clear that a number of Bank staff felt that we shouldn't be in Indonesia at all. So in some ways, I&#13;
was fighting on two fronts.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Bank staff in Washington mostly?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: In Washington. Mostly in Washington, but some ofthem in Jakarta. It was a lonely&#13;
job.&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia was going to hell in a handbasket. The longstanding critics of Suharto, who had been&#13;
waiting for 30 years to say this is all a sham, were now having their moment. The NGOs&#13;
[nongovernmental organizations] were all over us. If we tried to help the poor during that period,&#13;
it was seen as supporting the government. If we didn't, it was abrogating our responsibilities as a&#13;
development institution. So it was a very tough position to defend.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[James D.] Wolfensohn was extremely unhappy about the way Indonesia was being managed&#13;
generally and, for a very long time, blamed me personally for what had happened. Not an&#13;
economist, he simply couldn't believe we didn't know this was coming, that we were all&#13;
incompetent, buddy-buddy with the government. It is not true, but it didn't help.&#13;
&#13;
I had a relatively weak vice president in Jean-Michel Severino, who was young and new and&#13;
didn't get along with Wolfensohn. So I had no way of providing the defense I needed in&#13;
Washington to what we were trying to do out there.&#13;
&#13;
Wolfensohn hated the Fund and was being pressured and pushed into large financing packages&#13;
that ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Not only in Indonesia, but in Korea, for instance.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Yes. It was not a pleasant time.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
May came. The riots in Jakarta came. One of the most astonishing times in my life. I remember&#13;
standing at the window of my office in the stock exchange building. I couldn't see the crowds&#13;
because it was too far away, probably five miles. But I could see puffs of smoke. It turned out the&#13;
rioters were going gas station to gas station and lighting them on fire. And I could see these&#13;
pillars of black smoke coming up and listening to my secretary, marvelous woman, talking to her&#13;
husband on her cell phone, trying to save their kids, because their compound was-she was&#13;
ethnic Chinese-was surrounded by the Pribumis, native Indonesians. He was on the roof, trying&#13;
to protect their kids. She was still doing her job in the office at the same time that her husband&#13;
was trying to sneak their kids out of their compound on the back of a motorcycle.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Did they make it?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: They made it. In fact, we didn't lose a single staff. That night, Van [Robert V.]&#13;
Pulley, who was the assistant to Mr. Severino, called the person on my staff who was responsible&#13;
for our security plan, and told him that he wanted everybody evacuated in three hours.&#13;
&#13;
And I got a call from this person, and he said, "What am I supposed to do?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Don't do anything," and called Van. I doubt that I have ever in my life spoken to&#13;
                                     Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                    February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 43&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
anybody as strongly as I spoke to Van. I said, "You are not to talk to anybody in this country but&#13;
me. You are not to guess what is going on here without talking to me." I went on that "it would&#13;
be suicidal to try to get people to the airport today. They are safe at home. I am making the&#13;
judgment that they should stay there for now."&#13;
&#13;
Once the U.S. Embassy evacuated, it was clear the rest of us had to go. It is almost a legal&#13;
requirement that when an important bilateral agency takes its people out, the Bank has to follow&#13;
suit. So we put together an evacuation plan, and the next night Severino called me and said, "I&#13;
want all the staff out as soon as you can get them out."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "We are going to send most everybody out, but I would like to -keep a core group of&#13;
people here with me."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "No. I want everybody out."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Sorry, I am not going. We have been in this country for 30 years. I have national&#13;
staffthat are my responsibility. If you think for a moment I am leaving, you are simply wrong.&#13;
You can fire me after this, but in any case I am staying."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "I will call you back." So he hung up, he was upset. And he called me back later and he&#13;
said, "All right, Dennis. You can stay, although it is against my judgment." He had lost people&#13;
who had stayed behind in West Africa in an evacuation.&#13;
&#13;
I told him, "This is not West Africa. I know what is going on here. I am not at risk. I am not a&#13;
brave person. I am staying because my staff needs me, not because I want to put myself at risk."&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Did you feel in personal danger at any point?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: No, but that may have been a bit naive on my part. The night that the riots took&#13;
place, Bakti Sudaryono, the senior Indonesian in the office, came into my office and said, "Okay,&#13;
Dennis ... "&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I think I met him. He was the senior administrative guy. Yes.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Fantastic guy. Came in and said, "Dennis, we have to get you out ofhere, because it&#13;
is not clear how much more of a window we are going to get."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Okay, I will go, but I want everyone else to go to the Hilton [hotel]"-which was&#13;
walking distance from our office-" get rooms, and stay there. Nobody is to try to get home&#13;
tonight."&#13;
&#13;
So Sutano, my driver, took me home. I called back immediately when I got home. The staff had&#13;
tried to walk across the bridge that spans the Sudirman, the big highway there, and had been shot&#13;
at by the troops, thinking they were another part of the crowd. Bakti Sudaryono negotiated with&#13;
the troops for safe passage, so he is a real hero. There were so many heroes there.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
But I went home. Ben [Howard Benjamin] Fisher and others helped me put together an&#13;
evacuation plan that was, to this day, a model for the Bank. We didn't get ripped off by anybody.&#13;
Nobody was ever in danger. We got everybody to Singapore without panic, without problem. We&#13;
took them out Saturday morning.&#13;
&#13;
I was at the Hilton because that was our staging area. And I must say I can remember the&#13;
incredible sinking feeling as I stood there alone and watched these two buses pull out with my&#13;
entire staff.&#13;
&#13;
We took the UN [United Nations] out as well. There was absolutely no way they were going to&#13;
get organized enough to do it themselves. Their security system didn't work. I never rely on it.&#13;
&#13;
We found the plane. We hired it. We got it in and out. It was a model of sensible crisis&#13;
management, one I was really proud of.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Was there any input later from that plan to the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Yes. Batki has actually been asked to advise others on what we did. It was not clear&#13;
whether law and order was going to be restored. So we rented two apartments in the Hilton.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Who was left now? You were left.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: I was left with David [M.] Hawes, who was married to an Indonesian and couldn't&#13;
be made to go, and that was about it, plus my Indonesian staff.&#13;
&#13;
We rented two apartments in the Hilton and brought all of the families and children of our ethnic&#13;
Chinese in, and put them there for two, three nights, as long as they wanted.&#13;
&#13;
We offered to take our Indonesian staff to safe havens in either Sumatra or Bali. They had all&#13;
rejected it, which is what I would have done in their position. We stayed behind and helped them&#13;
look after themselves. Leadership at a time like that means somebody needs to be there who can&#13;
give confidence to people and say, "Do it and do it now." That was my job.&#13;
&#13;
You need safe apartments-do it. We will pay for it later. You need a plane-get it, at $130,000,&#13;
don't even think about it. We will do what is right, and we will figure out how to justify it later.&#13;
You want to get the UN out-take them out. We will deal with the consequences later. You have&#13;
some Americans who were left behind from the American evacuation, or whose brides or&#13;
whatever weren't American and couldn't get out-take them out. You simply do not ask, "Is this&#13;
right?" You know it is right, and you do what is right.&#13;
&#13;
That time was, for me, my proudest moment. I did what is right. I did it in the face of opposition&#13;
from my management, and it is something that, to this day, I am immensely proud of.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Did you face any adverse consequences as a result, after things had calmed down a&#13;
bit?&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                 45&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Right after everyone else left, I was really on the edge. Under a terrific mental&#13;
strain. I think I was very close to a nervous breakdown. I can remember sitting-it might have&#13;
been the day after everyone left, Friday or Saturday, in my living room-watching television, on&#13;
the floor by myself, suddenly realizing I was crying. I was just a basket case. The next day, thank&#13;
God, an Indonesian friend of mine said, "Dennis, you really need to get out of here." So he took&#13;
me out to the tea estates near Jakarta, which are gorgeous, and we just walked around and I&#13;
found some normalcy. It gave me time to get back into myself and take a deep breath of fresh air.&#13;
&#13;
Then I went back in, and then I began to focus on trying to make sure that Indonesia held&#13;
together. That is when I got in trouble. [Bacharuddin Jusuf] Habibie was the vice president.&#13;
When Suharto resigned, he became president. He put together a cabinet, the economic&#13;
component of which was very good. It was full of people that we had worked with in the past,&#13;
liked and respected. And I was, I think, the first person to say, "Look, I don't know about the rest&#13;
of Mr. Habibie's cabinet, but the economic team is a good team, and we can work with them."&#13;
Somebody had to say something, in my judgment, for the sake of the country. It might have been&#13;
reputationally risky for the World Bank, but I wasn't then worrying about the World Bank's        Â·&#13;
reputation. Again, something I am not sorry about; I think I did the right thing for the country.&#13;
&#13;
I appeared on several BBC [British Broadcasting Corporation] and others' programs, supporting&#13;
the economic team at a time when the Bank wanted a very low profile in Indonesia. Finally, I&#13;
think the week after the evacuation, Severino called and ordered me back to Washington for&#13;
"consultation." It was a very difficult time.&#13;
&#13;
We then moved through a period of rebuilding, where we were putting together these very large&#13;
loans to try to bolster Indonesia's revenue side, and at the same time, help get people through the&#13;
crises. Although it was really an urban crisis, not so much a poverty rural crisis, but there were&#13;
some pockets of poverty outside of Jakarta.&#13;
&#13;
It was an emotional, traumatic, testing time, very difficult on my wife, incredibly hard. We were&#13;
under enormous pressure. Through that whole period of 1998 we were under attack. I was under&#13;
personal attack. There were allegations of corruption, all sorts of bad things, and it was a time&#13;
when you just couldn't stop to think. You had to keep focusing on what was right, what had to be&#13;
done. It was the business you were in, and everybody wishes they had an opportunity to do that.&#13;

[Begin Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Today is March 22, 2006. My name is Charles Ziegler, a consultant with the World&#13;
Bank Group's Oral History Program. I have with me here in the World Bank Group Archives&#13;
Mr. Dennis de Tray for the third session of his oral history interview.&#13;
&#13;
Well, Dennis, it's good to have you back again, and last time we left off we were talking about&#13;
your fascinating experiences in Indonesia, and we'll continue with that, if we may. How would&#13;
you characterize your relations with the Indonesian government, local NGOs and other&#13;
Indonesian stakeholders?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Thanks, Chuck, and it's good to be back.&#13;
&#13;
One of the good or bad things about my experience in Indonesia is that I had been there three&#13;
years before the crisis hit. If one wants to be useful at the time of a crisis, you have to have built&#13;
the relationships on which you can draw. You can't build those in a crisis-it's a different&#13;
relationship.&#13;
&#13;
So by the time the crisis hit, I had very close relationships with all the key decision-makers in the&#13;
government and access to almost anybody I needed access to at that point. I also had what I&#13;
would characterize as a good relationship of respect and a good working relationship with the&#13;
NGO community. We had been quite active in our outreach to NGOs, and indeed not simply&#13;
because it was the thing to do, but because it was a useful part of our development work there.&#13;
So on that basis I felt that I was well positioned to lead the Bank's work as it evolved during the&#13;
CflSlS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Okay. World Bank President James D. Wolfensohn made several trips to Indonesia&#13;
during the time you were there. Can you relate some of the incidents during these visits that&#13;
particularly stick in your mind?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Well, there are many. Mr. Wolfensohn came to Indonesia early in his tenure, I think&#13;
in 1998.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: He came to the Bank in June '95.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: No. It would have been '95-it would have been '96, early '96, because it was one&#13;
of the first three or four trips he took. It was a very difficult trip. He was at the end of a long trip.&#13;
He had been to Vietnam and Singapore before. He was very tired. He was coming down with a&#13;
very bad cold, which eventually put him in bed, so he wasn't in the greatest of moods.&#13;
&#13;
It was in the days when Mr. Wolfensohn and Elaine, his wife, were still learning their way&#13;
around the culture of the Bank. And their handlers were creating a sense of utter terror in those&#13;
of us who had to prepare for these trips.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Who were their handlers, Bank staff?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Bank staff. First, there was his own office, which was in a way a large part ofthe&#13;
problem, or at least Mr. Wolfensohn thought they were a large part of the problem. But at that&#13;
point he was using trip assistants-! forget what they were called-but they were essentially&#13;
bright, relatively young Bank staff, Young Professional types, who had stood out, and then                                   '.-f'&#13;
would be plucked out for a period of three to four months to prepare his trips.                                              ~&#13;
                                                                                                                                :_&#13;

The first time that Mr. W olfensohn and his wife landed, they went to Bali to rest up a bit. We                                ()&#13;
                                                                                                                              ;.:&#13;
had dinner, all of us on the team, and then he sent the rest of them away, and he and I stayed                                Ul&#13;
&#13;
behind. I said to him, "Jim, I have to tell you I'm a very great believer in the things you're trying&#13;
to do for the Bank, making it more responsive and more accountable and the other things, and&#13;
that's why I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you. I have to tell you that in preparing for&#13;
this trip, the impression that your staff leaves of you and Elaine with my staff was not good-&#13;
extremely demanding, very status-conscious, and so forth. And I'm sure that's not you and I'm&#13;
sure it's not Elaine. I've met you and you're decent people. But this is a problem. It's not good&#13;
for you as the leader of a large development institution. I'm sure this doesn't sit well, but I felt&#13;
it's important to tell you."&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "Yes, that's great. I really appreciate it. I've told my damn staff not to do this," et&#13;
cetera, etcetera. But as time went on, I think all of us learned that it was as much Mr.&#13;
Wolfensohn as it was his staff. It got better over time, but those were in the early days, and that&#13;
trip was a really tough trip for everybody. It was not an experience any of us who were involved&#13;
in look back on with much joy.&#13;
&#13;
When he came again, it was during a crisis. By that time, he had already, I think, decided&#13;
Indonesia was not one of his favorite places. He just didn't connect with Indonesians and the&#13;
people, didn't like Mr. Suharto at all.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I was just going to ask you how he got on with Suharto.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: He had several conversations with Mr. Suharto. Mr. Suharto had dealt with many,&#13;
many powerful people around the world and Jim Wolfensohn was just another one. Jim was not&#13;
all that good at delivering tough messages, and Mr. Suharto was very good at blocking them&#13;
because he had the success of Indonesia over the past-that previous 30 years at his disposal as&#13;
he made the arguments that while things were tough and there was certainly a lot of corruption&#13;
around, he-Mr. Suharto---doubted very seriously that things could be quite as bad as Mr.&#13;
Wolfensohn and others were saying. How did the country grow at 7 or 8 percent? How did&#13;
poverty fall from 75 to 11 percent? How did exports grow so rapidly, not just yesterday, but over&#13;
30 years? And, to be honest, Mr. Wolfensohn didn't have an answer to those questions. So it was&#13;
not a good relationship from the beginning.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                    48&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
By the time the crisis was into 1998-he came, I think, in January or February, early in that&#13;
year-he was really upset with Indonesia generally because of what it was doing to the Bank's&#13;
reputation and his reputation as a fighter of corruption. I think he actually might have at one&#13;
point thought I might be complicit or responsible for some of this, and that didn't create a good&#13;
working relationship.&#13;
&#13;
So the second time he arrived it was a very tense relationship, and he was not at that point getting&#13;
along with Jean-Michel Severino, the vice president in charge of East Asia. It was a tense, tense&#13;
time. He was very focused on his legacy and his reputation. He didn't like the way the Bank&#13;
interacted with the IMF and the difficult position he was in.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: With regard to Indonesia, in this case?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: It was, I believe, one of his early, if not his first major global crisis where he began&#13;
to understand the limits to what he could do and what the Bank could do.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: It has been said that prior to the 1997 economic crisis in Indonesia-which, of&#13;
course, was part of the larger East Asia economic crisis-the World Bank was reluctant to&#13;
confront the Indonesian government on the high level of corruption in the country and that its&#13;
reports on Indonesia took a soft approach on corruption, thus feeding perceptions that the&#13;
country's problems weren't undermining the economy. How did you address the corruption&#13;
issue?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: First, I think it's important to put that statement in context. It's hard to imagine,&#13;
given what happened to Indonesia in 1997 to 1998, why an institution like the World Bank&#13;
wouldn't put corruption and governance front and center. But the fact of the matter is, in the&#13;
decade preceding the crisis Indonesia grew at over 8 percent a year, every year, on average. This&#13;
growth was definitely trickling down. Real wages were actually growing faster than the overall&#13;
per-capita growth rate.&#13;
&#13;
It was very, very hard to make an empirically-bas~d argument that there was something deeply&#13;
wrong with the Indonesian economy. So it was fine to say it was corrupt environment. It was,&#13;
and nobody, including the president or anyone else, denied it. But it was much harder to draw the&#13;
conclusion that the corruption was actually debilitating, that it was slowing growth. There was no&#13;
other large country that was doing better than Indonesia at that time. So-- and while we&#13;
continuously pointed out that corruption in the banking sector, weaknesses in the banking sector,&#13;
the civil service and the legal system were all systemic problems that Indonesia had to deal with&#13;
if it was going to sustain its growth, it was simply intellectually dishonest to draw the conclusion&#13;
that those things represented a current, immediate crisis.&#13;
&#13;
Many people took the crisis of 1997-the East Asia crisis and Indonesia's participation in it-as&#13;
a reflection of a "house of cards," an economy built on corruption and bad governance, which is&#13;
factually wrong. It was a political crisis. It was fueled, sparked, whatever the right metaphor, by&#13;
the East Asia crisis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                    February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      49&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Had Mr. Suharto been five years or ten years younger, I doubt that Indonesia would have&#13;
participated in the crisis at all. The contagion really occurred because Mr. Suharto had been&#13;
weakened over that year, and it was clear to many Indonesians that his time was nearly up.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Weakened physically, politically?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Everything. I reported in an earlier session that the Javanese are very spiritual, and&#13;
there was a sense that Mr. Suharto had lost his spiritual right to rule. There were many signs that&#13;
the gods had sent; at least many Indonesians believed so.&#13;
&#13;
By the way, it was not simply the cab drivers. This feeling could be found through the whole&#13;
intellectual spectrum of Indonesia. It became a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. When people&#13;
decided Mr. Suharto was on the last phase of his rule, the Chinese panicked and the money left,&#13;
and the rest is history. It's where the crisis came from.&#13;
&#13;
A bit of an aside: before the crisis I had asked Steve [Stephen R.] Dice to do an anecdotal report&#13;
on what our own colleagues and counterparts knew about corruption. None of it had to be&#13;
documented or based on concrete evidence, just generally the hearsay. That report I took to Mr.&#13;
Ginanjar Kartasasmita, who was then the coordinating minister for the economy, I believe, and&#13;
said, "You know, this is what we're dealing with, this is what we need to do something about.&#13;
We're not going to condition our assistance because there's no evidence here. But it is the&#13;
perception that needs to be fixed or, in my judgment"-and I told Mr. Ginanjar at the time-&#13;
"within three to five years it may be very difficult for the World Bank to lend to Indonesia." He&#13;
agreed that it was important, that we needed to take it to Mr. Suharto. Unfortunately, the next&#13;
day the crisis hit, and the Fund was in Jakarta within a few weeks, and that was the end of our&#13;
work on the corruption issues until the crisis was over.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Toward the end of your assignment in Indonesia, you delivered an address to the&#13;
Indonesia Forum of Economists in Jakarta. In it you said, quote, "The final message of this&#13;
experience for me is that culture matters. Now, of course, everyone knows this. We are taught to&#13;
be sensitive to different cultures. We've all read Culture Shock: Indonesia, but I am convinced&#13;
that we really do not understand the implication of cultural differences in designing&#13;
interventions, especially in times of crisis. I am sure that culture will be part of the ultimate&#13;
explanation of what happened in East Asia. Different cultures really do look on business&#13;
relations differently. This is no more clearly illustrated than the area of conflict of interest. It is&#13;
just not a concept that is in the people's vocabulary here in Indonesia. It is not understood. In&#13;
fact, the opposite is true. It is my obligation to help you as a friend and colleague," unquote.&#13;
&#13;
You went on to say, quote, "In the negotiations that the international financial institutions have&#13;
had here with the government, I have watched our technical people become extraordinarily&#13;
frustrated because they can't impose their highly Western, aggressive, conflictual program that&#13;
requires people to admit their errors and be very open and transparent. These are antithetical to&#13;
the cultural foundation of much of this country. That's a fact. It's not good or bad, just a fact,"&#13;
unquote.&#13;
&#13;
These are interesting observations and I think it would be useful if you could elaborate on them.&#13;

                     February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  so&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Let me underscore the point with three illustrations. One is that the program that the&#13;
IMF was attempting to develop in Indonesia was built on the correct presumption that a key&#13;
element in Indonesia's crisis was Mr. Suharto's personal credibility as a leader and related to our&#13;
earlier conversation about the fact that he was losing trust of the people for a variety of very&#13;
Javanese reasons.&#13;
&#13;
The Fund felt that in order to move forward, Mr. Suharto and his colleagues needed to make a&#13;
clean breast of it and say, "We're going to do things differently because we did them wrong in&#13;
the past." This is something that no first great leader will do, period, and no Javanese leader&#13;
could even imagine doing. Yet in the end, in the famous meeting with Mr. Carndessus, that's&#13;
exactly what was required and was done.&#13;
&#13;
If one stops to think about it, you were literally asking Mr. Suharto to commit cultural suicide in&#13;
front of his people. It is therefore no wonder that his people didn't believe him. They simply&#13;
could not imagine that any Javanese leader would do that. So in a way the basic premise of the&#13;
Fund's program, which was to admit fault and therefore signal that we've found religion and&#13;
we're moving to this new paradigm, was a non-starter.&#13;
&#13;
A second example: If you're going to do business in Asian cultures, and particularly in Indonesia,&#13;
you never confront the decision-maker and the power-holder directly. You never bring a problem&#13;
to someone.&#13;
&#13;
Let me illustrate. When I was first in Indonesia, I had a meeting with the minister of trade, and I&#13;
knew that there had been a letter delivered to the minister and to his staff that raised a serious&#13;
problem in one of our projects. That was my first meeting with the minister. After pleasantries, I&#13;
said, "Well, I understand, Mr. Minister, there is a problem."&#13;
&#13;
And he looked at me and he said, "A problem? We do not have a-I don't have a problem."&#13;
&#13;
I mentioned it, and he said, "No, no."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Sorry, my mistake."&#13;
&#13;
Mine was absolutely the wrong cultural approach. He knew that I knew that he knew, but you do&#13;
not say this in a public meeting with other people around. Even in private, it's a difficult thing to&#13;
do. So when the crisis erupted, one of my roles was to find back-door ways of getting to Mr.&#13;
Suharto, which was not easy.&#13;
&#13;
One of the venues for that was Mr. Bob Hasan, who was considered to be the president's closest&#13;
confidante. He played golf with him twice a week, and was his money man.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: He was Chinese, too, wasn't he?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: He was ethnic Chinese. It was one ofSuharto's very carefully worked-out strategies&#13;
to have a balance between the wealth-generating capacities of the ethnic Chinese, the civil&#13;
society, ethnic Indonesians-the Priburni-and the military. His success in Indonesia carne from&#13;
                                      Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                     February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   51&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
creating a balance among those three forces.&#13;
&#13;
I remember one day a meeting took place in my office during the crisis. One of the key elements&#13;
that was really at the core ofthe crisis was the president's own children. Perhaps the worst was&#13;
the president's son, Tommy [Hutomo Mandala Putra] Suharto, who controlled the clove&#13;
monopoly. Cloves were put into kretok cigarettes, which are the clove-based cigarettes that&#13;
Indonesians love. Tommy had been systematically destroying the clove industry by taxing them&#13;
and treating it as his own private bank account. One of the elements of the reform program was&#13;
that this would no longer happen. The clove industry would be liberalized and the clove farmers&#13;
could sell their cloves to anybody. At this meeting I was told by a very knowledgeable colleague&#13;
in the private sector who was in banking that it was well-known in the government and in the&#13;
private sector that Tommy Suharto was now getting his take by taking a percentage of the tax&#13;
stamps that went on top of the kretok cigarettes.&#13;
&#13;
This was an example of how endemic and difficult this corruption was in this environment. I&#13;
learned that Tommy was still on the take at about eight o'clock at night. I knew that if it became&#13;
public it would destroy the reform program by destroying any credibility that the Fund and the&#13;
Bank had in the agreements that we had struck with the government. I was by myself at this&#13;
point. All the international staff had been evacuated. I drove to Mr. Hasan's house. Fortunately, I&#13;
knew him well enough so that I could drive to his house to talk to him. I sat him down-or he sat&#13;
me down-and I said, "I don't want you to react to what I'm going to tell you, just listen, and&#13;
then I'm going to leave." And I told him what I had heard. At the end of it I said, "Bob, if I&#13;
know this, I'm sure you know it. If you and I know it, I'm sure it's about to come out publicly. If&#13;
you want this program to continue, if you want your country to be stabilized by these programs,&#13;
fix this, and fix it tomorrow." I left, and it got fixed.&#13;
&#13;
And that's the kind of relationship you have to have in Indonesia. You're dealing with Mr. Hasan,&#13;
who eventually went to jail for corruption. But you use those contacts for the greater good. It's&#13;
not that you particularly like to do business with Mr. Hasan, but ...&#13;
&#13;
The third example of why culture matters so much was one of my quite close friends, Mr. Tangri&#13;
Abeng, who was a very close associate of Habibie, then vice president and later president after&#13;
Mr. Suharto stepped down. Tangri had been president of the major business interest of Mr.&#13;
Habibie's. He was very nice, very urbane, very smart, Western-educated, a delightful man. He&#13;
entered the government as the minister of privatization of state enterprises, or something like&#13;
that. I can't remember the title, but it had to do with the privatization process. One day he called&#13;
me up and said, "Dennis, can we have lunch, just the two of us?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Sure."&#13;
&#13;
So we went out, and he was chatting away, and suddenly he said, "You know, I really have a&#13;
problem. I really don't understand what corruption is, and I'm afraid. I'm afraid that some of the&#13;
things I'm doing are corruption, but I don't know."&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And he was genuine about this?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                52&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: One hundred percent. This was a very good friend.&#13;
&#13;
There was something called KKN [Corruption, Collusion, and Nepotism]. It was the acronym for&#13;
all the bad things there, and Tangri said, "Please help me understand what these things mean and&#13;
what qualifies and doesn't because I don't want to get in trouble."&#13;
&#13;
You just have to take my word for it. He was genuinely concerned. He was afraid of going to jail&#13;
later. He was a smart man, and he didn't know what counted and what didn't count.&#13;
&#13;
That really just underscored how seriously the issue of culture enters this conversation. I'm sure&#13;
he had done corrupt things that he knew were corrupt, but there was a broad gray area that he just&#13;
didn't know how to deal with, that he didn't know what it was that he was going to get called on&#13;
the carpet for. Fortunately, he did not, because he was one of the troops, but he wasn't one of the&#13;
generals.&#13;
&#13;
But it really brought home to me how we go in with a pre-conceived Western notion-the Bank&#13;
and the international community-of concepts that are completely antithetical to the culture of&#13;
the people that we're dealing with, and then we wonder why things don't work.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: How would you characterize your relations with the IMF, Asian Development&#13;
Bank and the NGOs during the Indonesian economic crisis? In particular, I understand that you&#13;
were close with Stanley Fischer, the IMF's first deputy managing director at that time, who&#13;
showed up in Jakarta during the crisis to craft a bail-out package for Indonesia. What was his&#13;
take on the situation in Indonesia?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Stanley and I go back many, many years. He was a post-doc when I was getting my&#13;
degree at Chicago, so we've known each other since the late '60s. He's one of my heroes. He's a&#13;
terrific guy.&#13;
&#13;
My relationship with the IMF depended entirely on which phase of the crisis one speaks about.&#13;
In the early phases it was extremely tense because the leader ofthe IMF mission was-we didn't&#13;
go through all this last time?&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Some of it, to some extent.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: I'll be quick then. The leader ofthe IMF mission was, ifl might say so, classically&#13;
IMF. His view was, "It's none of your business; we'll call you when we need you."&#13;
&#13;
The IMF hadn't been active in Indonesia for several decades. The Bank had been there&#13;
continuously. It was a ridiculous situation, and finally I sent a very strong private note to Stan&#13;
saying, "My pride is not the issue. This is bad for Indonesia." And when the crisis really hit on&#13;
January 8th, 1998, when the rupiah dropped by 50 percent and there was panic buying, they sent&#13;
Stan out. Then relationships improved. But I do remember we went through all of this the last&#13;
time because we talked a bit about my advice to Stan.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In September 1999, you delivered a most interesting presentation to World Bank&#13;

staff in the H Building auditorium, now the Eugene R. Black Auditorium, entitled "Why Did&#13;
Things Go Wrong: Lessons from the Trenches oflndonesia." In the course of that presentation&#13;
you stated, quote, "The Bank is not a crisis organization. It was slow to adapt to the pace of crisis&#13;
decision-making. There was too much of a gap between decision-making in Washington and the&#13;
pace of crisis, as Jakarta was in flames. We're not going to be allowed to withdraw from this&#13;
arena of managed crisis situations, so we need to adapt the way we manage them, if it means&#13;
dividing operations between development lending and crisis management."&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: The contrast between the way the Fund operates and the Bank operates is really&#13;
very telling on that front. The Fund is hierarchical, militaristic in the way it's managed, very&#13;
secretive, very centralized. All of those characteristics are good for managing a crisis and bad for&#13;
doing development. So the Fund is a bad development institution and a good crisis institution.&#13;
The Bank is exactly the opposite. It's a good development institution and a bad crisis institution.&#13;
&#13;
My point to my management and colleagues in that talk was, "Look, you can't expect the&#13;
mechanisms you've set up to do development to be effective during a crisis. You have to have a&#13;
separate process-and you better think about that now. It's like evacuations. Don't think about&#13;
them when you need them; think about them beforehand."&#13;
&#13;
The support structure that I had in Indonesia was simply not coherent. It wasn't consistent. There&#13;
was no way of offsetting the weight of the Fund if we had wanted to do so. I couldn't do it alone.&#13;
&#13;
I had a manager in Jean-Michel Severino who, under the guise of strong decentralization and&#13;
devolution of responsibilities, said, in effect, "It's your crisis, you deal with it."&#13;
&#13;
But I said, "Jean-Michel, I'm sorry, it's not my crisis. This is the World Bank's crisis, and it needs&#13;
many others' attention."&#13;
&#13;
The role that Mr. Severino played, the role that Joe [Joseph E.] Stiglitz played were just not&#13;
constructive. In a way, nobody seemed to get their feet planted, and partly that was Mr.&#13;
Wolfensohn's discomfort with Indonesia. We never decided just which side of the fence we were&#13;
on, and that made for an interesting time. I was the fence.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What was your perception of the situation in Indonesia when you left for a different&#13;
assignment in March 1999?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: I thought it had come through the crisis. I thought that people were being extremely&#13;
naive at how quickly the political situation would settle down, and I think history proved me&#13;
right with Habibie as the first president and then [Sukamoputri] Megawati. During that whole&#13;
period, it was very hard to argue that there was much progress onÂ· corruption or economic&#13;
performance or anything else. It was just a period of stabilized chaos, if you will.&#13;
&#13;
One of the things that I tried to make to my colleagues as I left was that if you think that the&#13;
election which eventually brought Megawati in is going to somehow create an environment in&#13;
which it's going to be easy for you to do business here, you are wrong. I was right about that.&#13;
But it was also true that the country had come through a crisis with much less pain than it carne&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
through the 1965-66 transition of power, when half a million people died. In some small way I&#13;
believe I contributed to that, so I was pleased.&#13;
&#13;
It was a very painful departure. Indonesia was my life. If somebody had offered me a job outside&#13;
of the Bank that would have kept me comfortable there I would have stayed in a minute. My&#13;
wife loved it there, I loved it there. You know, in a time of crisis like that, you make very close&#13;
Indonesian friends in ways that you can't do otherwise. I didn't want to leave. I would have&#13;
stayed another year. But it was the right thing to do for the Bank. It was time for me to go. It&#13;
took me two months to really sort of sleep again. It had been a very long year.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In an article in the Wall Street Journal on July 14, 1998, you were quoted as&#13;
saying, quote, "I will admit to having a very strong sense of not fully understanding why things&#13;
are so bad in Indonesia. Believe me, I've spent night after night thinking what could we have&#13;
done to avoid having so many millions suffer. I will probably think about it for the rest of my&#13;
life," unquote. With the benefit of the passage of years, are you closer to an answer to that&#13;
question?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Yes. I honestly don't think that the external community could have done more&#13;
because this was not an economic crisis. It was a political crisis. It was a crisis of transition of&#13;
leadership. It was a deep civil crisis that had to do with Indonesia's stumbling step toward&#13;
democracy.&#13;
&#13;
It was a huge transition. It happened to take place during the time of an economic crisis. And a&#13;
lot of people suffered during it; mainly, it turns out, the middle class. Indonesia's income&#13;
distribution today is more equal than it was before the crisis because the main people hurt were&#13;
middle and upper-income people, urban people. The poor recovered. Rural communities&#13;
recovered very quickly, and many of them didn't get hurt at all.&#13;
&#13;
Were there things that I would have done differently? Yes, but overall, in terms of things that&#13;
would have made any difference in the outcome of the crisis? The answer is no. That is basically&#13;
my bottom line.&#13;
&#13;
There's an arrogance in the international community about just what we can and cannot do in&#13;
countries. We don't vote. We're not part of the electorate. We're not part of the civil society.&#13;
There are some things, by the way, including corruption, that can only be dealt with at that level.&#13;
We can help where there is commitment, but we can't make it happen, and that is the main&#13;
lesson.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: From September 1999 to August 2001, you were the IMF senior resident&#13;
representative in Hanoi, Vietnam. What occasioned your switch from the Bank to the Fund?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: When I came back from Indonesia in, I guess, June of 2001, I was, I confess, a little&#13;
bitter about the way Bank senior management had treated me. I felt I had been scapegoated a bit.&#13;
I, to this day, think I did a fantastic job. I'm incredibly proud of what I did in Indonesia and of&#13;
the tough decisions I took, of standing up for what I thought was right, of not doing the easy&#13;
things. And I sleep very comfortably on that at night. I was very upset that nobody at the Bank&#13;
                                      Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                     February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    55&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
seemed to recognize that. It wasn't that I didn't get promoted to vice president. It was that nobody&#13;
cared. That was what really bothered me.&#13;
&#13;
The second thing was nobody seemed to see that Indonesia represents for the Bank one of the&#13;
truly great development experiences, bad and good. Nobody seemed to care about trying to learn&#13;
everything they could from me when it was still fresh. They ignored me. I just found that&#13;
unacceptable and pathetic.&#13;
&#13;
So it became clear to me that I needed to go on and do something else. I looked far and wide and&#13;
decided I was going to leave development banking. Then I got a call from the Fund saying they&#13;
had this position in Hanoi. It was right at the time of the introduction of the Poverty Reduction&#13;
Strategy Facility and Paper.&#13;
&#13;
I talked to Stan and I talked to management at the Fund, and we agreed it might be a useful thing&#13;
to have a non-traditional Fund person in that environment. I knew Andrew [D.] Steer very well.&#13;
It would make a nice partnership, which is not always the case between the Fund and the Bank.&#13;
So that was why I decided to do it. I had been to Hanoi, and my wife and I both thought it would&#13;
be an interesting assignment.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: How did you find working for the Fund different from working for the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: The problem in answering that question is that there are two aspects to it. One is&#13;
that the role that the Fund accords resident missions is so vastly different than the role that the&#13;
Bank gives its resident staff. Resident missions for the Fund are still essentially mail drops. The&#13;
people there aren't even formally a part ofthe country team or the management that runs the&#13;
programs. Res reps [resident representatives] are actually managed out of another part of the&#13;
Fund. It's an archaic situation.&#13;
&#13;
I learned very quickly, to my dismay, that my management wasn't, in fact, at all interested in&#13;
changing the way they did business. The Fund is a very calcified organization. It's not going to&#13;
change. It doesn't want to change. It doesn't see any reason to change. Stan and I discussed this&#13;
through private e-mails a bit, but in the end he wasn't going to use his personal power to push&#13;
anything. So my time at the Fund was not a good marriage.&#13;
&#13;
There was a Washington-based mission leader, as the Fund always has, a woman from Thailand&#13;
named Chainpen Pukatikom, and Chainpen had a reputation in the Fund for being difficult.&#13;
There are lots of "difficult people" in the Fund, so the fact that she stood out meant that she was&#13;
a really tough person to work with and for.&#13;
&#13;
I loved working with the Vietnamese. I think in part the Fund eventually had a program there&#13;
because of my relationships with Vietnamese counterparts. They learned to trust me, which is&#13;
something I value enormously. Because of that they were willing to at least try a relationship&#13;
with the Fund. It didn't in the end work because of the cultural differences I was talking about,&#13;
and I don't think Vietnam ever drew on the facility that was set up.&#13;
&#13;
So even though we loved Vietnam, I decided' that the Fund was not a place that I was going to be&#13;
                                     Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                    February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   56&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
comfortable with in the long term, that they were not serious about exploring different ways of&#13;
doing business. I still think they probably shouldn't be in the poverty-reducing business. They&#13;
shouldn't be doing business in places like Vietnam which have no macroeconomic problem.&#13;
&#13;
Great experience in Hanoi, a learning experience for me in terms of what I care about. I learned I&#13;
wanted to be in a development institution. I did have a strong reentry guarantee to the Bank&#13;
because there were a number of people, including Richard [D.] Stem, who was at that point the&#13;
vice president for human resources, who felt I had not been well treated by the Bank and gave&#13;
me a very strong reentry guarantee to the Bank. But I didn't really have to use it, but we can get&#13;
to that when we get to Central Asia.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You touched on some ofthe difficulties in Vietnam. What were the major issues&#13;
that you confronted during your time there, a quick summary?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Well, first, there was a tremendous sense of distrust between governments and the&#13;
Fund.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The governments generally?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Generally, yes, and there was particularly strong distrust between the Vietnamese&#13;
government and the Fund. They didn't fully understand what the Fund was trying to do, and the&#13;
Fund's style really grated on a country that was and is extremely proud of its independence and&#13;
its heritage.&#13;
&#13;
Many of the issues in Vietnam were structural and long-term, and the Fund is not good at these&#13;
issues, so there was conflict there. There doesn't have to be, but depending on the personalities,&#13;
there can be a very high degree of distrust between the Fund and the Bank. I saw that in&#13;
Vietnam. I was right in the middle of it. Quite remarkable, truly amazing levels of distrust, to the&#13;
point of insult.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: This is in Vietnam?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Yes. I mean distrust to the point that there were suggestions that the Bank was&#13;
making up the numbers. Really left me open-mouthed. The Bank lead economist and Chainpen&#13;
had a visceral and personal dislike of each other. It was hard to be in the same room with them.&#13;
&#13;
And at one point they were yelling at each other, and I said, "I'm sorry, I'm leaving. This is&#13;
unprofessional and a waste of my time. I'm not going to sit here and listen. When you're done&#13;
and you want to talk substance, call me." And they shut up, but it was really pathetic. Both&#13;
parties were guilty, but I have to say in this case Chainpen, she just really disliked the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Were your relations with the Vietnamese complicated by any residual ill feeling&#13;
concerning the American engagement in Vietnam that ended in 1975?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: The American War, as the Vietnamese call it. One of the most remarkable surprises&#13;
and great pleasures to my wife and me was the fact that not only was there no residual animosity&#13;
                                     Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                    February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
from the war between the United States and Vietnam, but being an American was actually a plus&#13;
in Hanoi.&#13;
&#13;
With one exception in the entire two years we were there, I can't think of anyone who didn't&#13;
reach out more strongly to us than they did, for example, to Europeans. The French were not&#13;
terribly welcome. Somehow, the Vietnamese liked Americans.&#13;
&#13;
Bill [William J.] Clinton came during our visit, and people just fell in love with him. And of&#13;
course, he's great with people anyway. But we had a marvelous time there, and we were treated&#13;
with affection and respect, and made friends with Vietnamese families in ways that we could&#13;
never have imagined.&#13;
&#13;
During Tet [Vietnamese New Year], there's this wonderful tradition where all the Vietnamese&#13;
open up their houses to friends and family. During Tet there were no cars in the streets. It was&#13;
completely dead, and you just went around from house to house to house, meeting friends,&#13;
strangers. It was just marvelous. It was truly a great experience. We will, both of us, always have&#13;
a very soft place in our heart for the Vietnamese.&#13;

&#13;
ZIEGLER: In 2001 you returned to the World Bank, and the following month you were&#13;
appointed the Bank's regional director for Central Asia in the Europe and Central Asia Region,&#13;
based in Almaty, Kazakhstan. What occasioned this re-transfer, ifl can call it that?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: I had signaled, as I said earlier, to my colleagues in Washington that I wanted to&#13;
come back to the Bank, and I wanted to come back as a country director. Being a decentralized&#13;
country director for the World Bank is the greatest development position in the world.&#13;
&#13;
That took some doing because Mr. Wolfensohn, while he told Shengman Zhang that I was&#13;
certainly welcome back, wasn't so sure he wanted me back as a country director. Fortunately,&#13;
Shengman was a supporter. Mark Baird, Johannes Linn, people I knew well I like to think&#13;
respected me and accepted that I would do a decent job.&#13;
&#13;
Johannes told me that he was looking for somebody to run Central Asia. Would I be interested? I&#13;
went to the website and did some research, and decided this was actually quite an interesting part&#13;
of the world.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: It takes you back to [J. Rudyard] Kipling's "great game," almost.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: My wife, Mary, and I are very interested in history and culture, Mary, especially.&#13;
Central Asia is a wonderful part of the world for that. It also struck me as a very interesting part&#13;
of the world from the standpoint of development challenges, which we will get to in a minute.&#13;
&#13;
But, anyway, Almaty seemed like an acceptable place to work. And by the way, my predecessor,&#13;
Kiyoshi Kodera, had been in Washington. So the first part of this assignment was actually in&#13;
                                     Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                    February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       58&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Washington for six to eight months because I had to arrange for the decentralization of the&#13;
program, my office, and the staffthat goes with it.&#13;
&#13;
Kiyoshi is a wonderful man and a good friend, but was not the world's best country director. He&#13;
has many other strengths. weÂ·had to do a little rebuilding of staff and program in those early&#13;
days. It took Johannes and Shengman about three or four months to get Jim Wolfensohn&#13;
comfortable with the idea that I might be okay, and for Johannes to find the right time 'to say to&#13;
Jim, in effect, "Look, Jim, this is my decision, and I'll take the responsibility for it. If it turns out&#13;
to be a bad decision, you hold me accountable." I owe Johannes a lot for that. I personally didn't&#13;
think it was a big risk, but Jim can be hard to handle.&#13;
&#13;
So we came back to Washington in August 2001 and then went out to Almaty in June 2002.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What were some of the activities you had to undertake to set up this office, because&#13;
it was kind of a pioneering effort there, I mean, being a regional director?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: First, we had to think through the whole structure ofthe program. The challenge&#13;
that I put before my management colleagues in ECA was that I knew and supported and was&#13;
comfortable with the benefits of decentralization to a large country like Indonesia. I knew the&#13;
strengths that decentralization brought to the program and why it worked there. But the overhead&#13;
associated with decentralizing was not something that a small country could bear. So, how could&#13;
one bring the benefits of large-country decentralization to small countries? And out of that came&#13;
the idea of having a regional hub in Almaty, so you would, in effect, treat Central Asia as a&#13;
country, even though they were five separate countries. You would be serving 56 million people&#13;
and 40-45 projects, which was not Indonesia, but it was a substantial program&#13;
&#13;
Unfortunately, ECA was one of the least decentralized Regions in the Bank, and my&#13;
management colleagues there were not terribly behind the decentralization mantra. It took a long&#13;
time to convince them. While we didn't get as far as I wanted to get in terms of the nature of the&#13;
program-ECA came under lots of budget pressure, and because of that the whole&#13;
decentralization process was brought into question-we did make substantial progress.&#13;
&#13;
I think we did demonstrate-and we can get into that a bit later-that a well-managed,&#13;
decentralized team can change the nature of the program on the ground, and improve qualitative&#13;
and quantitative measures of success.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now the World Bank, as I understand it, has country offices in the capitals of each&#13;
of the countries under your purview. Were there any particular challenges in coordinating the&#13;
work of five different offices?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: The Central Asia job is like being vice president to a small group of countries, and,&#13;
as all Regional vice presidents in the Bank do, I spent a great deal of time traveling. It was the&#13;
travel aspects of the job that I miscalculated. The first year I was there, I traveled 217 days, or&#13;
something like that. And the next year it was like 210. Half of that, my wife was with me, so it&#13;
wasn't quite as bad as it sounds because she usually traveled whenever I traveled in Central Asia&#13;
unless they were very short trips, and some of it was back to the States on longer trips, on which&#13;
                                       Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                      February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   59&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
she also accompanied me.&#13;
&#13;
One essential element of running a country program like that was to have very good senior-level&#13;
country managers in each of these capitals because you simply shouldn'tand cannot manage five&#13;
separate country programs on your own. I was very proud of the quality and the character of the&#13;
people that I brought in. Within the first six months, four of the country managers turned over&#13;
the-Turkmenista n actually had a local liaison officer who was running our very small program&#13;
there, but the other four turned over, and the people that I hand-picked were all first-rate people&#13;
that ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Oh, so you selected your immediate subordinates there in the country offices?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Not one ofthem came through the Bank's standard personnel system because&#13;
nobody showed up, nobody wanted to go work in Central Asia. Chris [James Christopher]&#13;
Lovelace had been the director ofHD [Human Development] Network in the center and a very&#13;
highly-respected HD person in the Bank, the Bank's most senior HD. He had signaled to Annette&#13;
Dixon that he was interested in doing something different, and at that point I was looking for a&#13;
very senior HD person in my Almaty office. Annette suggested I talk to Chris.&#13;
&#13;
I had never met Chris before, but when I called him, I really liked his enthusiasm. He came&#13;
highly recommended, and Annette really backed him. So I said, "Great, Chris, why don't you&#13;
come out to Almaty and be my HD person?" to which he agreed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                    I wasn't sure, but I thought&#13;
maybe  I'd better move sooner rather than later. I had signaled to everybody  that I wanted a .&#13;
turnover. We needed new blood ...&#13;
                                                                                                          r:rJ&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So there were people out there already?                                                        ~~&#13;
                                                                                                        E-&lt;-&#13;
                                                                                                        u::r:&#13;
DE TRAY: Yes. There were country managers everywhere. So I called Chris back up and told ~ ~&#13;
him, "If you really want to do something different, if you really want to understand development,~g&#13;
be my country manager for the Kyrgyz Republic." Chris was an !-level staff, as I was, so it was et: ~&#13;
an unusual situation.&#13;
&#13;
And to his credit-and I really mean that-Chris thought about it for a few days and called me&#13;
back and said, "You know, it might be interesting." He was outstanding, just outstanding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         I eventually talked to Lou [Loup J.] Brefort, who was the senior H-level infrastructure&#13;
and energy person in my Almaty office, about moving to Astana. This was a bit of stealing from&#13;
Peter to pay Paul because I lost a very good infrastructure guy, but I found somebody good who&#13;
was prepared to go to Astana and work in very difficult conditions with the new government. He&#13;
did a great job.&#13;
&#13;
Uzbekistan is a really difficult country to deal with. I was in Osh, in the Kyrgyz Republic, and&#13;
                                      Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                     February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  60&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Martin Raiser, who was at that point the second or third most senior economist at the European&#13;
Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD], an absolutely outstanding intellect,&#13;
somebody that I had worked with, and was recognized as an absolute star, very highly thought of&#13;
in EBRD, came up to me and said, "Dennis, I hear that David Pearce is leaving." David had to&#13;
retire.&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "It's true."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "I'm sure that there's no point in it, but I'm thinking of a field assignment, and&#13;
Uzbekistan sounded interesting."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Martin, you apply for this job, and if I have to kill somebody, you're going to get it."&#13;
I almost did have to kill somebody, but he did get the job, and he was fantastic. He's now leaving&#13;
to move to Kiev. He was at that point 32 or 33 years old. I thought he was 42. He looks it and he&#13;
acts it. One of the two or three most outstanding people I've worked with in 25 years, and I got&#13;
him to work on Uzbekistan.&#13;
&#13;
That's what good managers do. That's what I'm proudest of-the team I put together, a great&#13;
team of people. We turned that program around in three-and-a-half years, and the numbers show&#13;
it. So that was a good ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I was just going to ask you about that because in the statement to the Board in&#13;
December 2004 you noted, quote, "Before September 11, 2001, the Bank's Central Asia program&#13;
had plateaued. We were facing a declining program in Kazakhstan, serious dialogue problems&#13;
in Uzbekistan, project implementation problems in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and a need to&#13;
reenergize our Kyrgyz program." How did you proceed to address these issues? Well, clearly,&#13;
part of it was getting a good team in place.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: A major part of it was getting a good team in place, and part of it was instilling in&#13;
that team a sense that the challenges of Central Asia were the challenges of the Bank. If we could&#13;
provide innovative leadership, we could really make a difference, not just to Central Asia, but to&#13;
the entire Bank. We really needed to step back and look for different ways to do business&#13;
because the Bank's standard ways of doing business in these countries weren't working.&#13;
&#13;
We spent three years building a relationship in Kazakhstan that went from negative when I first&#13;
arrived, to the Bank as the single closest adviser to the government. The government didn't do&#13;
anything without talking to us first. They turned to Loup Brefort and Pedro [L.] Rodriguez, the&#13;
lead economist, immediately upon wanting anything. We introduced a joint economic research&#13;
program, in which they paid half and we paid half, which is one of the most innovative ESW&#13;
[economic and sector work] programs in the Bank. We transformed literally 180 degrees the&#13;
relationship in Kazakhstan.&#13;
&#13;
We went from a program in Uzbekistan that was entirely confrontational, based on a CAS&#13;
[Country Assistance Strategy] that the Uzbeks disowned at the time it was presented to the&#13;
Board, to a program in which we could demonstrate progress and the influence we were having&#13;
on health and education and local public services. We disagreed on many important things, but&#13;
                                       Dennis N. de Tray&#13;
                      February 15 and 21 and March 21,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   61&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
we had a dialogue that was working.&#13;
&#13;
Tajikistan moved from a program that was disbursing at 8 or 9 percent a year to at one point&#13;
being the highest-disbursing program in ECA, at around 33 percent, a complete turnaround in the&#13;
quality of the portfolio. Why? We brought in good people. We had Will em Zijp as an operations&#13;
manager. We had good people on the ground who supported the country managers.&#13;
&#13;
We had Martin Raiser in Uzbekistan and Cevdet A. Denizer in Tajikistan-young&#13;
macroeconomist countiy managers who were great at the dialogue but needed help on the&#13;
portfolio. It was exactly this ability to provide something that you couldn't provide country by&#13;
country but you could provide out of the hub in Almaty that led to a sea change in the way we&#13;
did business there. I'm completely convinced that the successes we had there could not have&#13;
happened if the program had not been decentralized.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The countries for which you had responsibility all tended to be more or less&#13;
strongly authoritarian countries with rankings well into the lower half of Transparency&#13;
International's 2005 Corruption Perception Index, thus making them similar to Indonesia in at&#13;
least those respects.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Right.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: How did your experiences in Indonesia inform your work in these countries?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Having worked five years in Indonesia and two years in Vietnam was actually a&#13;
very good training ground for coming to Central Asia. Indonesia demonstrated that the impact of&#13;
corruption on development, growth, sustainability, poverty reduction was much more&#13;
complicated than the kind of zero and one image that it was painted in many-by Transparency&#13;
International, for example. You could, if you were good, find ways to get countries to grow and&#13;
alleviate poverty even as corruption remained a problem.&#13;
&#13;
Vietnam taught me that you had to go beyond, if you will, the rhetoric about state-driven&#13;
mandates and look at the reality on the ground. Vietnam was growing very well then, with lots of&#13;
private investment in a communist regime.&#13;
&#13;
Vietnam also taught me that location, as in housing, is everything. Vietnam and Indonesia are&#13;
located in one of the hotspots of the world in terms of growth and exports. Vietnam has 1,200&#13;
kilometers of coastline. Central Asia is one of the most locationally-disadvantaged places you&#13;
can imagine, and that really does change the development challenge.&#13;
&#13;
What it did not do for me was to improve my credibility in the dialogue with the Central Asians.&#13;
They didn't believe they could learn anything from Vietnam or Indonesia, which was dead&#13;
wrong. Central Asians are a very arrogant group of people, who see themselves as middle-&#13;
income people who have fallen on hard times. Don't even mention Africa. Latin America-not&#13;
really, but we'll listen a little. Basically, Eastern Europe and Europe is what they look to as their&#13;
standards. And yet my lessons all came from countries to the east. It was an interesting&#13;
challenge, dialogue-wise.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The World Bank news release announcing the completion of your tenure in Central&#13;
Asia states, quote, "Under Mr. de Tray's leadership, the World Bank in Central Asia has moved&#13;
to a more flexible, innovative and responsive partnership approach in line with the rapid&#13;
economic and political changes taking place in the region and growing pressure from&#13;
governments to provide quicker and better-targeted development assistance." Could you just&#13;
elaborate a little bit on the various aspects of this flexible, innovative and responsive partnership&#13;
approach?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: You know, Chuck, the Bank, it has a wonderful record of saying the right things. If&#13;
they would just do what they said, they would, I think, make significantly greater progress on the&#13;
development front. We talk a lot about partnerships with countries, about country ownership, and&#13;
about the need to respect the views of countries. We don't walk that talk.&#13;
&#13;
It started with Kazakhstan, because Kazakhstan is at the front end of a huge oil boom. It not only&#13;
doesn't need our money, it doesn't want the World Bank's money. It already has a sterilization&#13;
problem, and doesn't want more dollars flowing in. Its parliament and its president kept asking&#13;
why the country should be borrowing with one hand when it's parking, I think it's now up to $8&#13;
or $9 billion of reserves offshore, with the other hand, just to keep them out of the Kazakhstan&#13;
economy. Yet it's a country with Third World infrastructure and systems. So how do you operate&#13;
in that kind of setting?&#13;
&#13;
The first thing you have to do is to convince the government (a) that you respect them, (b) that&#13;
you're on their side, and (c) you listen, and (d) you have something of value to bring to the table.&#13;
The first meeting I had with our principal counterpart would have been early 2002. Kirat&#13;
Kelimbetov, who was minister of economy, is a young guy; he was very aggressive, really&#13;
dressed me down for lots of things the Bank had done. Completely unexpected. I was absolutely&#13;
open-mouthed and could have gotten quite angry, but decided it probably wasn't worth it. Mr.&#13;
Kelimbetov is now one of my best friends in Kazakhstan. That took three years, and it took a&#13;
tremendous team and great work on the part of Loup Brefort, the country manager, and&#13;
particularly Pedro Rodriguez, who was the economist in charge. Pedro had the perfect&#13;
combination of economic skills and schmoozing skills to get inside the door, and he delivered,&#13;
and that's what they wanted. It completely transformed the relationship.&#13;
&#13;
We took key government ministers to Geneva for two days of talks before our last CAS process.&#13;
It was a really open set of discussions. We got lectured, and we got told what was right and&#13;
wrong, and we told them what was right and wrong. The payoff was intangible but huge. We'd&#13;
started a real conversation, and they now knew we were prepared to listen to them. We&#13;
developed the single most flexible country assistance strategy, country partnership strategy-we&#13;
were among the first to use the phrase-ever to get through the Board. Mr. [Alexey] Kvasov, the&#13;
Russian ED [Executive Director], called it "revolutionary" in the Board. It was 14 pages long. It&#13;
had no lending table, no ESW table. It was built on the government's own annual business plan.&#13;
That's responsive and real flexibility.&#13;
&#13;
Even the Thailands, the Brazils, the Mexicos of the world, haven't achieved that level of country-&#13;
driven, demand-driven program. Did we give up our principles? Absolutely not. If we don't agree&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
with, we don't do it.&#13;
&#13;
The core of that program was the Joint Economic Research Program, which was financed by&#13;
both the Bank and the government.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That was going to be my next question, about the 2004 country partnership strategy&#13;
in Kazakhstan that was built around a unique Joint Economic Research Program.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: That program is, I believe, unique. There are other reimbursable technical&#13;
assistance programs in the Bank for Saudi Arabia, for Chile, for others. But this program was not&#13;
reimbursable technical assistance.&#13;
&#13;
What made this program valuable was that both parties, the Bank and Kazakhstan, put money on&#13;
the table, and both parties were accountable for the use of that money. My colleagues now&#13;
negotiate each year a work program built around this mutual accountability that has several&#13;
aspects. Its main focus was on economic and sector work, with some technical support in those&#13;
areas where the government's programs and interests coincide with ours.&#13;
&#13;
That work often led to project ideas that then would eventually spin off into projects, and it&#13;
forced an honest level of engagement, a real discussion. You knew at the end of the&#13;
conversations that we had about this program that we agreed on where we could add value. The&#13;
government was sufficiently interested to put their own money on the table. This was some of&#13;
the most carefully monitored money that the government spent. The government had to report to&#13;
the parliament on this money. It was only about $1 million, but it was very visible in the&#13;
government's budget. They reported to the parliament, they reported to the president's&#13;
administration, and to. the president himself. So they had to have a good story, and they had to&#13;
tell what difference it was making.&#13;
&#13;
A fantastic program. To this day, I don't understand why it is not standard in every middle-&#13;
income country. Every country above the $1500, $2000 per capita income mark has money in&#13;
their budget to put $1 million or $1.5 million in a joint program. It is the dynamics that the&#13;
program creates, the relationship it creates, that is so special. It is the core of our program in&#13;
Kazakhstan, and completely turned the relationship around.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Does it owe anything to your time spent earlier in the Bank's research complex, or&#13;
did this evolve subsequently?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: It does, in a way. One ofthe criticisms that I remember discussing earlier was the&#13;
lack of connection between the ESW work that the Bank staff do, which is often too supply-&#13;
driven, and government needs. And governments don't own most ofESW, they don't understand&#13;
it, and they certainly very seldom read it. So I wanted a program that was demand based and in&#13;
which we could demonstrate that the government really wanted it. It was the co-financing that&#13;
really made it work. So I think, yes, I did inherit the notion that I wanted a mechanism that&#13;
created the right incentives on both sides of the table in the ESW program.&#13;
&#13;
I want to get to Tajikistan in a minute. The interesting thing for me is that we used this same&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
model of relationship-building in our poorest country, Tajikistan. Kazakhstan is $3000 per&#13;
capita, Tajikistan is $300 per capita. We had an okay program in Tajikistan, but the government&#13;
was a long ways down the capacity scale, and they were really not taking seriously their role.&#13;
&#13;
So we took the key ministers to Warsaw, and we spent two days convincing them that they had&#13;
to make the decisions on the allocation of our IDA resources, not us. We couldn't say yes to&#13;
everything. There was a fixed pool of money, and if they wanted $5 million more for this, they&#13;
had to tell us where they wanted to take the $5 million from. We weren't going to make that&#13;
decision. We had a broad framework of activities, all of which we agreed were important. And&#13;
we laid out a strategy going forward.&#13;
&#13;
At one point in the discussion in Warsaw, the head of the delegation, Mr. Kolboboyev said,&#13;
"Dennis, this is all well and good, but this is really not what we're interested in. We're interested&#13;
in" this, this and this.&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Okay, Mr. Kolboboyev, I'm going to call a coffee break right now, and you go&#13;
caucus with your people. When you're ready to tell us what strategy you do want, you come&#13;
back."&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "No, no, no, no."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "No, it's coffee time, and you just let us know when you're ready to come back in."&#13;
&#13;
Fifteen, twenty minutes later, we reconvened. They said, "Okay." And, of course, it was part of&#13;
what we had, and a couple of new things.&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Fine, terrific." They as a government had to make the decision. We had another meeting&#13;
in Dushanbe, and there was a particular pet project that the government and the central bank&#13;
wanted-$5 million for a credit line, which I thought was completely useless. But I said, "Mr.&#13;
Alimardanov, if you want that project, fine, but we have to take it out of the infrastructure&#13;
project."&#13;
&#13;
The infrastructure people went berserk. I said, "Fine, I'm not making this decision. You're the&#13;
government. It's your IDA money. You tell me how to do it."&#13;
&#13;
Alimardanov said, "All right, you win, Dennis, we'll put it back in infrastructure."&#13;
&#13;
Of course, I told them my views, but I did not make the decision. The challenge was getting&#13;
them to take responsibility for the program. That was part of this relationship-building, and very&#13;
critical. It's just as important in the poor IDA countries that have to have us there as in the rich&#13;
middle-income countries. Success is a relationship issue.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In the Kyrgyz Republic I understand that you took an innovative approach to&#13;
poverty reduction called the Village Investment Project, which is based on a model developed in&#13;
Indonesia.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Right.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Could you please relate how this initiative evolved from your experiences in&#13;
Indonesia?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: There was a village infrastructure project in Indonesia, the VIP [Village&#13;
Infrastructure Project] project, the first of its kind. Scott [H.] Guggenheim developed it. Then it&#13;
moved to something called the Kecimatin Development Project, which was at a slightly higher&#13;
level of government. Both projects had the same general characteristic, which is that in order to&#13;
try to bring more accountability into the system and hopefully less leakage and less corruption.&#13;
Decision making took place at village or Kecimatin level. Local people decided how to spend the&#13;
money, within some bounds. They were supported by village engineers who could advise them&#13;
on whether the bridge was going to stay up or not, if they wanted a bridge. They had to account&#13;
for the money. These were fairly large projects, in the $70,000 to $100,000 range.&#13;
&#13;
The Kyrgyz village infrastructure project was a much more community-based project, same&#13;
concept, but smaller amounts of money, built on the same principles. A very successful project,&#13;
disbursed rapidly, did what it was supposed to do. Every survey that we were able to do said the&#13;
accountability that we tried to build into the system worked, that the civil society, the citizens of&#13;
these villages were holding their representatives accountable for this money, were actually&#13;
saying no when they thought it wasn't being used well, demanding it back when it was going in&#13;
the wrong direction. A very successful project. It was a good but all-too-infrequent example of&#13;
cross-fertilization of ideas from one country to another.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: How did the military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq affect your work in&#13;
Central Asia?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: In a very interesting sense. When I took the job in the summer of.2002, Central&#13;
Asia was a back-water, and I was interested in trying to bring some attention to it. September&#13;
11th changed that dramatically. Indeed, my first visit to Central Asia-or my second visit, I&#13;
guess-was to the Fergama Valley. My first visit was with Johannes Linn in mid-October. It was&#13;
the only trip I ever took that my father called me and asked me not to take.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: This was 2001?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Right. It was a month after September 11th. It was silly for people to worry. You&#13;
were safer in Uzbekistan than in Washington, D.C. I assure you, I don't take risks; I don't like&#13;
them. We were down about 10 kilometers from the air base that the U.S. was setting up near&#13;
Karshi. It was an interesting trip.&#13;
&#13;
I took another trip later that year through the Fergama Valley, which is the heartland of Islam in&#13;
Central Asia, in December of 2001. The coldest trip I've ever in my life taken. A trip that was&#13;
designed to give me credibility when I argued that things were not falling apart in Central Asia.&#13;
There wasn't an uprising in the making, which was good because I didn't have any great game&#13;
plan for one. A phenomenal trip.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
There was a kind of moment in the sun for Central Asia following September the 11th, then the&#13;
effect of the U.S. military investments in the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan to support the&#13;
Afghanistan campaign, and subsequently the relationship that [Islom Abdug' aniyevich] Karimov&#13;
and Uzbekistan had with the U.S., which made him a little over-confident in terms of what he&#13;
thought he could get away with. The "Dutch Disease" resources problem driven by expected&#13;
assistance from the United States, which didn't materialize. This really upset Mr. Karimov.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In November 2004 Mr. Wolfensohn visited Almaty. What were some of the&#13;
significant events of that visit? And I hope it was a little more upbeat than his visit to Jakarta.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: It was actually a visit to all of Central Asia.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I've seen photos. I had to process some photos of that trip and it looked quite&#13;
interesting.&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: Mr. Wolfensohn came back from the trip, went to the Board and said it was the&#13;
most interesting trip he had ever taken in his time at the Bank. Now he may say that about every&#13;
trip he comes back from, but he loved Central Asia. He loved the culture of it. He was fascinated&#13;
by the leadership. He was interested, as many people are, in how different it is from what you&#13;
think it's going to be.&#13;
&#13;
Johannes Linn was along. I kept my mouth shut, which helped, I'm sure, make it a great success.&#13;
We all flew back with Jim to Paris, and then I went on to Washington. On Jim's plane we had&#13;
one of the most interesting debriefing sessions, where Jim went through his notes from the trip,&#13;
and we took it all down. Mr. Wolfensohn will never be the easiest travel companion. But he liked&#13;
that trip. He behaved well, and came back very enthusiastic.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Did relations with headquarters in this posting differ in any significant respect from&#13;
those in your posting in Indonesia?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: The problem with answering that question is the context. I became country director&#13;
in Indonesia. When I was director of the resident staff in Indonesia during the first three years of&#13;
the stay, Marianne Haug was the country director. That was pre-1997; it was an entirely different&#13;
system ofrelationships. A great job. It was almost like being a country director but different.&#13;
Then in mid-1997 I became country director, and within a month and a half the crisis hit. That&#13;
dominated my time as Central Asia was a more standard relationship, but it did bring home to me&#13;
one truth, which is if you're decentralized and working on a large, attractive country like&#13;
Indonesia, the Bank comes to you. If you're working on five not-so-attractive countries in the&#13;
middle of nowhere, you have to go to the Bank. It was a much greater challenge for me to&#13;
manage the Washington part of the matrix while I was in Central Asia than when I was in&#13;
Indonesia. If I ignored the Washington half of the matrix in Indonesia, it took care of itself. It&#13;
had to-there was just too much business and too many people not to be engaged.&#13;
&#13;
If I wanted good people to work on Central Asia, I had to find them, one by one. I could work&#13;
with my country managers, had recruited them, could make them enthusiastic. Harder for&#13;
Washington staff. Until the crisis hit, I spent very little time back in Washington when I was in&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia, probably a couple weeks a year. I would be back here four or five times a year from&#13;
Kazakhstan, and it's a long, difficult trip. I even got to the point where I would come back for&#13;
three weeks or so with no schedule, just so I could spend time with my D.C. colleagues and&#13;
really manage the Washington side of the program. That was the big difference in the process.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, Dennis, I've come to the end of my questions, and is there anything that we&#13;
have not covered that you would like to raise or add to this?&#13;
&#13;
DE TRAY: First, Chuck, I'd like to thank you for the opportunity and I'd like to thank you for&#13;
your patience and hard work in putting together this material. It has been enormously helpful in&#13;
JOggmg my memory.&#13;
&#13;
The only bottom line for me is that it was a fantastic 23 years, not without its bumps, but if you&#13;
didn't have bumps, you wouldn't know the good times. I had a wonderful run at the Bank, and as&#13;
I said in my goodbye speech, I really thank everyone who contributed to that run. It was a&#13;
privilege to work here. During the good times and the bad times. Again, thank you for doing this.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And thank you for participating in the Bank's Oral History Program.&#13;
