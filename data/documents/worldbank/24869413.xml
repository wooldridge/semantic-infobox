auppoaed to be an espert on technical aaaiatance.        It ia in that suiae       OLIVBR.:     We arâ&#128;¢ talkin&amp; about 1960 or a-.thina like that.&#13;

          The Algerian experience was absolutely faacinetina.       We found a           Africa'l&#13;

            In November 1985, Munir P. Benjenk was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Professor Robert W. Oliver. During his
            tenure at the Bank from 1963 to 1984, Mr. Benjenk, worked in
            the following areas: in the development services department
            as a technical assistance officer (1963-1965); in the Africa
            department as deputy director (1965-1967); in the Europe,
            Middle East and North Africa department as deputy director
            (1967-1970), director (1970-1972), and vice president
            (1972-1980); in external relations as vice president
            (1980-1984); and at the Economic Development Institute (EDI)
            as chairman (1983). His transcript concerns his tenure at
            the Bank. Mr. Benjenk spends some time elaborating on when
            the World Bank at one time concluded that Morocco had
            violated a clause in a loan agreement and the manner in
            which it was handled during the presidency of George Woods.
