BRAZIL&#13;
RIO GRANDE DO SUL STATE HIGHWAY MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
I. TRANSPORT SECTOR OVERVIEW&#13;
A. The Transport Sector in the Economy&#13;
1.01   The transport sector accounts for a rather low R$13 billion or 4.3 percent of Brazil's GNP. Road&#13;
transport alone accounts for about 3.2 percent. But these figures exclude the very important segments of&#13;
own-account transport, services by truck owner-operators, and private automobile use, which are not&#13;
accounted for in GNP calculations. Total transportation expenditures amount to about US$90 billion&#13;
equivalent, and road transport accounts for 85 percent of that total (Table 1, Annex 6). The transport&#13;
industry has grown at rates which have systematically exceeded those of GDP. In the 1970s, when GDP&#13;
increased at an average 8.5 percent per year, the transport industry grew at over 11 percent per year; in the&#13;
1980s and early 1990s, when GDP grew at an average two percent per year, the transport industry grew at&#13;
three percent per year on average (Table 2, Annex 6).&#13;
1.02   Public investments in transport, which used to account for about 40 percent of total public capital&#13;
formation in the 1960s and the early 1970s and reached 3.3 percent of GNP in 1975, have sharply&#13;
decreased to below one percent of GNP since 1981. Road expenditures in particular had to be curtailed&#13;
severely, which resulted in the deterioration of large portions of the networks built in the 1950s and 1960s.&#13;
The unsatisfactory operational and financial performance of the railways also led to underinvestment,&#13;
insufficient maintenance, and to the deterioration of railway tracks, motive power and rolling stock.&#13;
Because of the size of the transport industry, its direct impact upon the productive sectors, the extensive&#13;
involvement of the government and the fiscal implications, the performance of the transport sector is&#13;
critical to the success of the Government's economic stabilization and growth efforts.&#13;
B. Sector Policy and Institutional Reform&#13;
1.03   The management of the transport sector is undergoing significant changes. A number of reforms,&#13;
which aim at reducing government expenditures in the sector, at deregulating and privatizing transport&#13;
services so as to allow market forces to be the primary determinant of the services provided, and at&#13;
decentralizing expenditure and financing responsibilities to lower levels of government, have been recently&#13;
undertaken or are about to be implemented. The Concession Law, enacted in February 1995, establishes&#13;
the legal framework for private concessions of public services. A proposal for a new Transport Law,&#13;
which would redefine the entire transport system under federal jurisdiction, is currently being considered by&#13;
the Congress. The following paragraphs summarize the status of these reforms.&#13;
1.04   Highways. The Constitutional reform of 1988 decentralized fiscal revenues, transferring road user&#13;
taxes to States and Municipalities, but kept unchanged the distribution of responsibilities among the three&#13;
administrative levels. The reform has affected the ability of the Federation to rehabilitate and maintain an&#13;
extensive federal highway network, and to finance needed capacity investments. The Govermment has&#13;
decided to reduce the size of the road network under federal jurisdiction to the interstate highways and&#13;
intemational connections, to transfer the operation and maintenance of high-traffic highways as well as&#13;
capacity investments to private concessionaires where feasible, and to transfer other highways to state&#13;
jurisdictions. A highway concession program has been developed and initiated, with five concessions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
already awarded. Agreements have been reached with the state governments on the highways to be&#13;
transferred from federal to state jurisdictions and on the main conditions of the transfers (section E).&#13;
1.05   Railways. The Government is currently restructuring the federal railways (RFFSA) into six&#13;
regional operations and concessioning these operations to private operators, with assistance from the Bank&#13;
under the Federal Railways Restructuring and Privatization Project (Loan No. 4046-BR). About 15,000&#13;
redundant staff had their employment terminated and received severance payments, partly financed under&#13;
the Bank loan. Many are being retrained and will receive outplacement assistance. Five concessions have&#13;
been successfully auctioned and contracted, and the first ones already show substantial operational&#13;
improvements. Similarly, the Government of the State of Sao Paulo has decided to restructure and to&#13;
privatize Ferrovia Paulista S.A., following a similar model. Finally, the Federal Government decided to&#13;
privatize CVRD, including the railways owned and operated by CVRD.&#13;
1.06   Ports. The Government closed the National Port Holding Company "Portobras" in 1990 and the&#13;
Congress approved a law for a broad deregulation of the port system in February 1993. The Port Law&#13;
liberalizes port activities, enabling private terminals to operate for public use and private port operators to&#13;
compete with the port administrations. It also decentralizes normative and tariff setting responsibilities to&#13;
newly-created local Port Authority Councils, and establishes port labor management entities. Some ports,&#13;
including Santos and Rio Grande, have made progress in implementing the reform. The Government has&#13;
recently developed an action plan for the full implementation of the reform, including the privatization of&#13;
the ports and terminals.&#13;
1.07   Multimodal Transport. The rapid evolution and expansion of intra- and inter-regional trade,&#13;
fostered by regional trade bloc initiatives and by agricultural expansion and industrial development in the&#13;
interior of Brazil, will require important changes in the national and international transport systems. Freight&#13;
carriers will be required to provide efficient and comprehensive logistical services to agricultural, industrial&#13;
and commercial shippers, and for this purpose they will have to seek innovative multimodal transport&#13;
solutions which maximize productivity and quality of service. This in turn will require a much better&#13;
integration of the transport systems, particularly railroads and ports, which represent the major bottlenecks&#13;
in the present transport system. The restructuring and privatization of railroads and port terminals, if&#13;
adequately completed, is expected to resolve the bulk of the intra- and intermodal bottlenecks.&#13;
C. The Road Transport Industry&#13;
1.08   Road Freight Transport Industry. The country's 15,000 commercial trucking firms together&#13;
own about 25% of the truck fleet, and truck owner-operators operate another 25% of the fleet. Own-&#13;
account trucking therefore represents the remaining half of the truck fleet. Trucking firms are highly&#13;
specialized as to the type of market served and service provided, including routes and products. Larger&#13;
firns concentrate their services on denser routes, while smaller firms appear more frequently in less dense&#13;
or more specialized links. Owner-operators generally operate older, medium-size trucks with conventional&#13;
open bodies, on medium and long-distance hauls. Own-account trucking is most important in pick-up and&#13;
delivery services in the cities, and in the inter-city transport of cargoes which require specialized equipment.&#13;
1.09   The trucking industry overall is efficient. Truck rates reveal a competitive position in relation to&#13;
rail transport. The share of operational expenses to revenues varies from 50% to 70%, and total expenses&#13;
are about 90% of revenues. There is no evidence of above-normal profits. Investments, however, have&#13;
tended to decline in relation to GNP since the mid-1970s. Medium-size trucks have been substituted for&#13;
smaller trucks and pick-ups in urban services, and for heavier trucks in inter-city services. The number of&#13;
owner-operators has been decreasing gradually since the mid-1970s and their fleet is rapidly aging.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.10   The trucking industry is largely unregulated. The role of the Government has essentially been to&#13;
provide and maintain the road infrastructure. The Government influenced operations only indirectly&#13;
through pricing and taxation of inputs, and license fees. In 1983 a law was passed authorizing the&#13;
Government to regulate the industry, and some important restrictions were introduced. But insufficient&#13;
political support and means of enforcing legislation have made the impact of these restrictions negligible. In&#13;
1990, the Government revoked all these restrictions.&#13;
1.11   Road Passenger Transport Industry. Passenger transportation in Brazil is considered to be a&#13;
public service. Entry into the sector is regulated by government through licenses or concessions. Federal,&#13;
State, and municipal governments set rates, routes, frequencies, and safety and quality standards in&#13;
practically all market segments. There are a few publicly-owned and operated firms in some of the largest&#13;
cities. Private enterprises, however, are predominant in number and hold the largest share of the market.&#13;
The majority of these firms are small to medium in size. In the interstate segment and in dense inter-&#13;
municipal connections, however, there are a few firms providing services in complex networks, operating&#13;
fleets of more than a thousand buses. In the urban segment, large firms are rare; they usually serve a&#13;
strictly defined geographic zone, operating a fleet of up to two or three hundred buses from a single garage.&#13;
D. The Highway Networks, Maintenance Condition and Policies&#13;
1.12   Brazil's road system has a total length of&#13;
about 1.6 million km. The system is divided into  Table 1.1: Brazil's Road Networks (Thousand Kin.)&#13;
three administrative levels: (a) a federal network         Paved      Unpaved        Total&#13;
of about 67,000 km under the jurisdiction of the    Federal  52          15           67&#13;
National Roads Department (DNER); (b) state    State        85          115          200&#13;
networks totaling about 200,000 km under the&#13;
responsibility of the 26 states, two federal    Municipal   1,&#13;
territories and the Federal District; and (c)    Total      152        1,505        1,657&#13;
municipal networks extending over some 1.4&#13;
million km under the jurisdictions of over 4,000 Municipalities (Table 1.1 and Annex 6, Table 3).&#13;
1.13   The federal network is paved over 75% of its length, i.e. about 52,000 km. The majority of the&#13;
unpaved network is located in the Amazon region, where traffic volumes are still too low to warrant costly&#13;
paving improvements. Built mainly between the 1950s and the 1970s, the federal network has suffered&#13;
extensive deterioration as a result of age, heavier-than-expected traffic volumes and axle-weights, and&#13;
inadequate maintenance. In the early 1980s, the situation of the federal network was dramatic, with the&#13;
proportion of pavements in bad condition, because of major structural problems, reaching 30%. From that&#13;
time, however, DNER, scaling down new construction programs, has placed major emphasis on&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance. About 25,000 km were rehabilitated or resurfaced, half of which with&#13;
assistance from the Bank under three completed projects (Sixth Highway Project, Loan no. 1557-BR,&#13;
Federal Highways Sector Project, Loan no. 2446-BR, and Highways Management and Rehabilitation&#13;
Project, Loan no. 3169-BR). Pavement condition surveys carried out in 1996 show that the condition of&#13;
the network has effectively improved in terms of both structural capacity and surface defects, with about&#13;
10% of the network being considered in poor condition (Table 4, Annex 6).&#13;
1.14   The state networks comprise approximately 200,000 km, i.e. 12% of Brazil's total road length.&#13;
About 85,000 km (or 43% of total state network length) are paved, 64,000 km (or 32%) are graveled, and&#13;
50,000 km (or 25%) consist of earth roads. Network length has been increasing at a steady rate of 7% p.a.&#13;
over the past 30 years. The density of state roads, however, is still very low (23 meters per km2 and 700&#13;
inhabitants per km of road, as an average). Five states (Goias, Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, Mato Grosso and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Bahia) together account for half of the total length, and four states (Sao Paulo, Parana, Bahia and Minas&#13;
Gerais) account for half the length of the paved networks (Table 5, Annex 6). Traffic on state networks is&#13;
estimated at about 50 billion vehicle-km, i.e. about 25% more than on the federal network, and it is&#13;
growing faster (at about 9% p.a.), which leads to a substantial need for pavement maintenance and&#13;
strengthening, as well as for new paving and capacity expansion programs.&#13;
1.15   The surface condition of the paved&#13;
state networks is now worse than that of the    Table 1.2: Condition of State Paved Networks, 1989&#13;
federal network, despite the younger age of             Good    Regular    Poor     Total&#13;
the pavements (the weighted average age   OOO'Km.        34.0     28.0     20.0     82.0&#13;
being about 13 years).  A comparative                             35%      23%      100%&#13;
study of the maintenance condition of the&#13;
federal and state networks, carried out in&#13;
1989 under the coordination of the Brazilian Association of the DERs (ABDER), showed that about 42%&#13;
of the paved state highways were in good condition, 35% in regular condition, and 23% in poor condition;&#13;
and about 75% of those in good condition were less than five years old and 80% of those in regular&#13;
condition were in the five to ten year age range. The majority of the pavements in poor condition are more&#13;
than twelve years old. These results confirm that after a relatively slow but increasing deterioration&#13;
process in the first ten years, paved highways deteriorate very rapidly when adequate maintenance is not&#13;
carried out. The paved networks are therefore now reaching a critical phase of rapid deterioration, thus&#13;
requiring intensive rehabilitation and maintenance efforts. The condition of the unpaved network is also a&#13;
source of concem: 36% of the roads are in good condition, 39% in regular, and 25% in poor condition.&#13;
Also, almost 25,000 km of gravel roads have traffic volumes above 200 vehicles per day, and are&#13;
candidates for paving to reduce road maintenance and vehicle operating costs.&#13;
1.16   State govemments urgently need to develop and implement well-balanced road programs which&#13;
give adequate priority to routine and preventive maintenance, and to pavement strengthening and&#13;
rehabilitation, while keeping upgrading and paving programs consistent with the financial capabilities of&#13;
the state. For that purpose, state governments need to strengthen their highway agencies, through technical&#13;
assistance and training of their personnel, with a view to monitoring the condition of their networks, and&#13;
developing efficient rehabilitation and maintenance strategies and programs.&#13;
E. Highway Administration and Decentralization&#13;
1.17   Responsibilities for administering the country's road network are shared between DNER&#13;
(67,000 km), the 26 state road departments (DERs, 200,000 km), and the 4,000 or so municipalities&#13;
(1.4 million km). Following the 1988 constitutional and fiscal reforms, which have transferred the bulk of&#13;
road user tax revenues to the states and municipalities, the Federal Government has also decided to&#13;
decentralize responsibilities for administering the road networks. In particular, the size of the federal&#13;
network is to be reduced to the main interstate highways, through gradually transferring to the state&#13;
governments the responsibility for the other highways of predominantly local interest. The Federal&#13;
Government has prepared a plan, including the relevant draft legislation, for the transfer of about 17,500&#13;
km of roads from federal to state jurisdictions. Agreement has been reached with most states on the&#13;
specific highways and on the conditions and timing of their transfers.&#13;
1.18   DNER and many of the DERs have developed into large organizations to administer the extensive&#13;
construction programs of the previous decades. There are still substantial needs for building new roads, in&#13;
particular in the Center-West Region, and for capacity investments in the South and Southeast regions.&#13;
However, since large portions of the networks are now reaching a critical age, highway maintenance is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
becoming, or it should become, the main activity of most agencies. Therefore, the agencies have to make&#13;
important institutional adjustments, in particular to develop appropriate road maintenance planning and&#13;
management systems, and to rely more systematically on the more efficient private contractor industry&#13;
rather than force account even for routine maintenance activities. DNER and some DERs have undertaken&#13;
such reforms under Bank-financed projects.&#13;
1.19   The decentralization process will require a broad reform and strengthening of the highway&#13;
institutions. The Federal Government has developed a strategy and an action plan to implement this&#13;
administrative reform of the highway subsector, including actions to: (a) gradually transfer the federal&#13;
highways of predominantly local interest to the state governments; (b) develop appropriate capabilities at&#13;
the federal level, for subsector policy formulation, planning, research and technological development,&#13;
including the management of the reduced federal network; (c) reorganize and streamline DNER in&#13;
accordance with its new responsibilities; and (d) assist the state governments in developing appropriate&#13;
capacity within the DERs for the management and maintenance of the state networks, including the&#13;
transferred highways. The recently-completed Highway Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (Loan&#13;
3169-BR) helped prepare programs (a) to (c). The ongoing and the proposed State Highway Management&#13;
Projects support the implementation of program (d) in a number of states.&#13;
F. Highway Financing&#13;
1.20   Road User Charges. The system of road user taxes underwent substantial changes with the fiscal&#13;
reform of 1989. The federal level lost its power to impose taxes on petroleum and alcohol products and on&#13;
motor-vehicle ownership, retaining only the petroleum import tax (IIP). The states gained from the&#13;
inclusion of petroleum and alcohol products and of inter-state and inter-municipal transport services in the&#13;
base of the value added tax (ICMS) and the right to tax motor-vehicle ownership. The municipal level&#13;
increased its participation in the revenues of the value added tax from 20% to 25%, and in those of the&#13;
motor-vehicle ownership tax (IPVA) from 40% to 50%; and they gained authority to impose a tax on sales&#13;
of gasoline and alcohol (IVVC). The ICMS imposed on petroleum and alcohol products has resulted in a&#13;
net increase in tax revenues and in an improved structure of road user taxes, as compared to the previous&#13;
tax, which was levied at a reduced rate on diesel oil and from which alcohol was exempted. Toll revenues&#13;
are marginal, but DNER and some states are planning to expand toll collection on high-traffic highways&#13;
through concessions. Overall, the states' and municipalities' revenues from road user taxation have&#13;
increased substantially, while those of the Federation have been reduced. The three administrative levels&#13;
recover at least the total costs of the appropriate operation, maintenance and rehabilitation of their road&#13;
networks. State and municipal governments are also able to recover from road users all or a substantial&#13;
portion of their road upgrading and construction expenditures (Table 6, Annex 7).&#13;
1.21   Fuel Prices. The prices of motor-vehicle fuels at the pump, in the first quarter of 1997, were&#13;
about US$0.80, US$0.43 and US$0.66 equivalent per liter of gasoline (which includes up to 20% of&#13;
ethanol), of diesel-oil, and of alcohol (or hydrated ethanol), respectively.  These prices have been&#13;
consistently maintained well above international prices, including the necessary adjustments for taxes,&#13;
distribution costs and retailers' margins. The Government has gradually reduced the implicit subsidy on&#13;
alcohol, and intends to eliminate it by 1998. The implicit subsidy is currently comparable to the estimated&#13;
environmental benefits derived from the use of ethanol as compared to gasoline.&#13;
1.22   Funding of Road Agencies. Road expenditures used to be funded mainly through revenues from&#13;
road user taxes, which were shared between the three levels of government and earmarked for that purpose.&#13;
In the 1980's, however, tax earmarking was gradually discontinued with a view to restoring central control&#13;
over public expenditures. The road agencies have consequently seen their resources erode drastically since&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
general budget allocations did not make up for the loss of earmarked funds, and their construction and&#13;
maintenance programs were affected. The proposed project would assist DAER in preparing appropriate&#13;
road programs based on sound technical and economic criteria, and help ensure adequate funding for the&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance programs (para. 3.06).&#13;
G. Bank Sector Experience and Strategy&#13;
1.23   The Bank has made 31 loans im the transport sector since the early 1960s: 15 for highways and&#13;
feeder roads, six for railways, two for ports, and eight for urban transportation, in addition to financing&#13;
rural roads under a number of agriculture projects. Until the mid-1970s, the projects concentrated on the&#13;
expansion of the trunk highway network and on the improvement of the railway and mass transit systems.&#13;
In subsequent years, emphasis gradually shifted to the maintenance and rehabilitation of the interstate and&#13;
trunk highway network, to the planning and implementation on a decentralized basis of feeder roads&#13;
programs, to the rehabilitation of important railway corridors, and to the improvement of public bus&#13;
transport and traffic management in the major cities. More recently, the Bank has been supporting the&#13;
rehabilitation and decentralization of urban train systems with four loans, highway rehabilitation,&#13;
maintenance and decentralization with one loan to the Federation and five loans to states, and the&#13;
restructuring and privatization of the federal railways with a recently approved loan.&#13;
1.24   The Bank's involvement in the transport sector has been successful.  The projects' physical&#13;
objectives have generally been met, although the more recent difficult economic conditions and related&#13;
funding problems have sometimes caused delays. Progress has been made on policy reforms and&#13;
institutional strengthening though it has taken more time than expected, due to the size and complexity of&#13;
the sector, the large number of government agencies and public enterprises involved, and the difficulty of&#13;
reaching the needed consensus for policy reforms. Under the recently-completed Highway Management&#13;
and Rehabilitation Project (Loan No. 3169-BR), the Federal Government, in consultation with the state&#13;
governments, developed a broad reform and decentralization of the highway administration. The ongoing&#13;
State Highway Management Projects have already achieved substantial progress in re-orienting the&#13;
participating states' highway programs to ensure appropriate priority for maintenance, and in strengthening&#13;
the planning and maintenance management capabilities of the DERs.&#13;
1.25   The assistance of the Bank to the transport sector of Brazil will remain oriented by broader country&#13;
objectives, particularly: (a) stabilization and consequent need to contain public expenditures, increase&#13;
revenue mobilization and to improve resource utilization; (b) economic growth, ensuring efficient and&#13;
reliable infrastructure services to targeted growth sectors of the economy; (c) redefinition of the role of the&#13;
state, strengthening its regulatory functions, withdrawing from operations and promoting private sector&#13;
participation in infrastructure; (d) administrative decentralization; and (e) environmental management.&#13;
1.26    Emphasis will be upon the formulation and effective implementation of appropriate transport&#13;
policy and institutional reforms including: (a) restructuring and privatization of railways and ports; (b) re-&#13;
design of sector regulations, establishment of appropriate regulatory agencies, and effective implementation&#13;
of regulatory reform, which, together with efficient pricing mechanisms and privatization measures, aim at&#13;
restoring the role of market forces in the sector; (c) institutional reform, including effective decentralization&#13;
of government responsibilities, seeking an appropriate balance between fiscal revenues and responsibilities,&#13;
strengthening the normative and monitoring functions at the center, and the planning, management and&#13;
environmental control capabilities of the decentralized entities; (d) privatization of operation and&#13;
maintenance services through concessions and management contracts; and (e) public investment&#13;
programming and private sector investment promotion based on appropriate economic, environmental and&#13;
project finance analyses, aiming in particular at facilitating intra and inter-regional trade flows.&#13;

II. RIO GRANDE DO SUL HIGHWAY SYSTEM&#13;
A. Overview of the State's Economy&#13;
2.01   The state of Rio Grande do Sul, with an area of 280,000 km2 (or half the size of France) and a&#13;
population of 10 million (i.e. 6 percent of Brazil's population), accounts for 7 percent of Brazil's GDP and&#13;
12 percent of exports. The state's economy has a strong base on cattle farming, agriculture and industry.&#13;
The state is a major producer and exporter of meat, rice, corn and soybeans. Its industrial value added&#13;
accounts for about 33% of GDP. It is particularly developed in manufacturing of capital and durable&#13;
consumer goods, as well as shoes and leather-related goods. The state is particularly well situated, at the&#13;
borders of Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, to benefit from the Mercosul Trade Agreement. Recent&#13;
economic performance, however, has been disappointing.&#13;
2.02   The major factors of the poor economic perfornance have been the decline of the agriculture&#13;
sector, inadequate economic management, and the consequent deterioration of the public sector and of the&#13;
public infrastructure. Recent economic policies and public management were characterized by recurrent&#13;
fiscal deficits, increasing government borrowings, and excessive public employment. The state's fiscal&#13;
balance showed substantial primary deficits during most of the 1980s. The state's debt increased up to 200&#13;
percent of net current revenues in the early 1990s. The primary surpluses in the early 1990s were&#13;
insufficient to meet debt service obligations. Excessive personnel is the major expense item. The&#13;
infrastructure services provided by loss-making state-owned enterprises have generally been ineffective.&#13;
The inefficient public expenditure programs, giving priority to new construction projects at the expense of&#13;
the maintenance of the existing infrastructure, led to the deterioration of large portions of the public&#13;
infrastructure. In particular, the poor standards and condition of the state road network is an important&#13;
deterrent to more intensive private investment in agriculture and industry, and an obstacle to the&#13;
development of the state.&#13;
B. The Reform of the State&#13;
2.03   The Government has recently developed and initiated a broad reform of the state. The reform&#13;
focuses on improved tax collection, reduced expenditures particularly through staff retrenchment, and&#13;
privatization or concessioning of public utilities and infrastructure services. Since it does not have control&#13;
over the rate of the sales tax (ICMS), which constitutes the bulk of state revenues besides federal transfers,&#13;
the state plans to increase revenues through improvements in tax administration, particularly tax audits and&#13;
legal enforcement. The civil service reform aim to rationalize the structure of the government, eliminating&#13;
redundant administrative units, restructuring and downsizing others with a view to reducing the wage bill.&#13;
Recent progress was made with a program  of voluntary departures.  Further progress on staff&#13;
retrenchment, however, depends on the repeal of the federal protection of public servants.&#13;
2.04   The Government has developed a broad reform of the delivery of infrastructure services, which&#13;
encompasses the privatization of power and telecommunication utilities, and the concessioning of water,&#13;
ports and roads systems. The state's proposed road concession program is discussed in section E. The&#13;
reform is expected to substantially improve the state's fiscal situation and increase the efficiency of the&#13;
infrastructure sector. In March 1997, the Bank approved a State Reform Loan (Loan No. 4139-BR),&#13;
which will assist in the implementation of the reforrn, including with the concessioning of roads. The&#13;
proposed project would deepen the reform in the roads sector of the state, which accounts for a major share&#13;
of government expenditures.&#13;
&#13;

C. The State's Highway Network, Maintenance Condition and Policies&#13;
2.05   Network classification. The state of Rio&#13;
Grande do Sul has a total road network of about           Table 1: Network Classflcation&#13;
139,000 kIn, of which 7.3% is paved. Some 5,500  Jurisdlction   Paved (Ian)  Unpaved(kfm)  To4a(km)&#13;

unpaved, fall under municipal responsibility. The  Municipal  330      123,400    123,730&#13;
state road department (DAER) is responsible for a  Total     10,170    128,585    138,755&#13;
network of approximately 9,500 kIn, of which about&#13;
50% is paved. In 1980, the length of state paved roads was only 1980 km but a sustained upgrading and&#13;
paving program enabled to increase that figure to nearly 4700 kIn, thus an average rate of paving of about&#13;
170 km per year. In addition, a total of approximately 2,500 km of federal roads are expected to be&#13;
transferred to the state's jurisdiction as part of the federal government decentralization program, and 500&#13;
km of those would be rehabilitated in the transfer process.&#13;
2.06   Network  condition.   The  state's paved&#13;
network mostly consists of granular base-course    Fig I Surface Condition of Paved Network&#13;
overlaid over almost 60%  of its total length with&#13;
asphalt concrete and 40%  with surface treatment.                       49%&#13;
According to a survey made in 1995 which included   E  1500&#13;
objective  measurements  of surface  defects  and   c  i ooo&#13;
roughness, the paved network has 26% of its length in  cn  500&#13;
good condition, 50% in fair or regular condition, 17%                               m  I&#13;
in critical condition and about 8% in poor condition.    0&#13;
Comparative surveys carried out since 1992 indicate         Good   Falr  Critical  Poor&#13;
that although the proportion of roads in poor condition         Surface Condition&#13;
has consistently been between 16% and 20% over the&#13;
last four years, the percentage of roads in good condition fell from 50% in 1992 to about 26% in 1996,&#13;
thus suggesting the need to halt the tendency for further deterioration. Deflection measurements carried out&#13;
in 1996 indicate that pavement structures are fairly strong over almost 2/3 of the length of the network with&#13;
average deflection values below 0.65 mm. The proportion of weak pavements exhibiting deflection values&#13;
above 0.65 mm is about 30%. The above figures are consistent with the age distribution pattem of the&#13;
network which shows that about 10% of the pavements are less than five years old, while 30% have&#13;
exceeded their 15-year service life. Regarding the unpaved network, most of it is graveled and can be&#13;
traveled year-round by light vehicles at an average speed varying between 40 and 60 km/hour, with a&#13;
corresponding roughness of between 12 and 15 IRI. There is also need for improvement since adequate&#13;
grading and regraveling operations would reduce the level of roughness to less than 10 IRI, enabling&#13;
average speeds of up to 70-80 km/hr to be attained.&#13;
2.07   Traffic. The average annual daily traffic is uniformly distributed on the state's paved network,&#13;
generally ranging between 500 and 5,000 vehicles according to the latest, 1994 data available. Almost&#13;
30% of the length of paved roads are traveled by more than 2,000 vehicles per day. The average daily&#13;
traffic corresponds to about 1,200 vehicles per day (1,600 on asphalt concrete roads, and 750 on surface-&#13;
dressed roads). On the unpaved network, traffic volumes are lower, although quite appreciable, varying&#13;
between 100 and up to 1,000 vehicles per day, with a percentage of trucks of about 30%. About 3,000 km&#13;
of unpaved roads (or 63% in length), which carry more than 250 vehicles per day, require extensive&#13;
maintenance from DAER's districts. These roads are candidates for upgrading and paving, which, subject&#13;
to appropriate economic analysis, could be justified in economic terms through the reduction of both road&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
maintenance and vehice operating costs. The distribution of the paved and unpaved network lengths by&#13;
traffic ranges is shown on Figures 2 and 3 hereafter.&#13;
2.08   Maintenance Strategy.    About 50%  of&#13;
routine maintenance activities on the paved network are  Ig 2 Daily Traffic on Paved Network&#13;
contracted out. On the unpaved network, maintenance  1600&#13;
has been carried out essentially by force-account. In    1200&#13;
order to improve efficiency, DAER intends to contract    1000    2. &#13;
Ego&#13;
out all routine maintenance on the paved network over   E 600{&#13;
the next three years, and on the unpaved network by the  400                   .3%&#13;
end of 2001.  In addition, a pilot project for the  200                    4%    3.9%&#13;
rehabilitation and subsequent maintenance during five  0  _                 1       -&#13;

unpaved roads under a performance-type contract is                        0 n       A&#13;
scheduled to start shortly. The proposed project will         Average DailyTraffic&#13;
build upon this first experience and assist DAER in&#13;
implementing  such  maintenance  policies  and       Fig3 Daily Traffic on Unpaved Network&#13;
networkwide.  The state also initiated a toll road&#13;
program in 1992 to shift the maintenance cost burden  2000    37% 36.&#13;
from the treasury's general fund to road users. Tolls    1500             26%&#13;
are collected on three roads of a total length of about       1000i&#13;
150 km by a private company contracted by DAER.     500&#13;
Toll revenues are used to finance rehabilitation and  0&#13;
maintenance works, as well as the widening to a dual       5°&#13;
carriageway of one of the roads.  Neighborhood&#13;
commissions  assist DAER  in  supervising  and                Average Daily Traffic&#13;
monitoring toll collection and in deciding on the&#13;
application of toll revenues. Finally, an important concession program involving about 2,500 km of high&#13;
traffic roads is being initiated (section E).&#13;
2.09   Maintenance Policies. A set of maintenance policies were developed by DAER using the HDM&#13;
III model; they were reviewed and found satisfactory by the appraisal mission. Pavements in good to fair&#13;
condition showing roughness level of less than 3 IRI and carrying traffic volumes below 1,000 vehicles per&#13;
day require only routine maitenance. For these roads, routine activities include essentially patching of all&#13;
potholes and the maintenance of the drainage system, horizontal marking, and vertical signs. When traffic&#13;
exceeds 1000 vehicle per day and deflection is high, routine maintenance is no longer sufficient and&#13;
periodic overlays using 4 to 8 cm of asphalt concrete should be applied when roughness exceeds 4 IRI. For&#13;
the unpaved network, the maintenance policy will consist in applying at least 6 gradings per year, including&#13;
regraveling operations, whenever the residual thickness of gravel reaches 5 cm. Such policies will help&#13;
maintain the network at an average level of 6 to 8 IRI, with a year-round traveling speed of about 70&#13;
km/hr. The economic analysis also showed that upgrading and paving operations are justified whenever&#13;
traffic volumes exceed about 500 vehicles per day, providing the unit costs of such works are kept within&#13;
reasonable limits, i.e., substantially below US$200,000 per km (Annex 2, section E).&#13;
2.10   Rehabilitation Policies. In order to restore and preserve an adequate level of service over the&#13;
portion of the paved network which presently shows signs of fatigue and deterioration, a rehabilitation&#13;
program was prepared on the basis of a matrix representing the actual condition of the network and the&#13;
traffic that it carries. The program was designed using the HDM and EBM model with updated unit costs&#13;
for rehabilitation activities and vehicle operations. The VOC submodel was calibrated to reflect modem&#13;
vehicle technology with adjusted fuel and spare parts consumption. The optimized rehabilitation program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
resulting from the economic analysis comprises two sets of standards: (a) resurfacing of about 1,850 km of&#13;
roads in regular condition, using a thin 4 cm asphalt concrete carpet; and (b) strengthening of about 840&#13;
km of roads in critical or poor condition, using 5 to 8 cm thick asphalt concrete overlays or reconstruction&#13;
(Annex 2). These interventions will nonnally prolong the service life of the pavements for about 10 years&#13;
whereupon a new overlay program will need to be implemented.&#13;
D. The State's Highway Expenditure and Funding Program&#13;
2.11   Upgrading and Paving Program.  On roads        Fig 4 Evolution of the State Paved Network&#13;
where total transport costs have become excessive as a             since 1980&#13;
result of traffic volumes and costly grading and   Es&#13;
regraveling operations, their upgrading and paving was  u- 6000&#13;
shown to yield significant economic returns (Annex 2).   500&#13;
DAER  prepared a five-year upgrading and paving        3000&#13;
program  comprising about 1,000 km  of the highest   * 2000&#13;
priority road sections of the unpaved network.  The   0  1000&#13;
objectives of the program are to: (i) provide adequate, '  0&#13;
all-year round  traffic  conditions  for agricultural   L    1980  1985  1990  1995  2000&#13;
production; (ii) connect important centers of agricultural            Year&#13;
and industrial production with the main intermodal&#13;
transport system; and (iii) facilitate trade with other MERCOSUL countries. The upgrading and paving&#13;
program is also expected to help reduce transport costs and the risks of accidents on these roads. The&#13;
Government recently negotiated a loan with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in order to help&#13;
finance the program. The Government also intends to upgrade and pave an additional 800 to 1000 km of&#13;
state roads over the next 5 years if the fiscal situation of the state allows it. The IDB-financed program&#13;
alone would bring the total length of the paved network to about 5,700 km in the year 2001 (Fig 4 herein).&#13;
2.12   The State Govermnent's five-year&#13;
highway public expenditure program,               Table 2: Five-Year State Highway Program&#13;

paving of about 1,000 km of high priority   IDB (150M) + Japan Eximbank (75M)&#13;
roads with clear economic justification.&#13;
The cost of this base case program of works is estimated at about US$515 million equivalent over 1997-&#13;
2001. In the event that the state's fiscal situation permits, the Government could proceed with a&#13;
supplementary upgrading and paving program which could require up to US$190 million equivalent. The&#13;
total cost of the program, including DAER's staff payroll and pensions, administrative expenses and debt&#13;
service, is estimated at US$850 million equivalent over the five-year period, or at US$1,040 million&#13;
equivalent if the supplementary program is included (Anmex 4, Table 3).&#13;
2.13   The program of works is expected to be funded as follows: (a) the rehabilitation component would&#13;
be partly financed by the proposed Bank loan of US$70 million equivalent; (b) the maintenance component,&#13;
also included in the proposed project, would be fully funded by the State Treasury; (c) the upgrading and&#13;
paving program would be partly financed by the recently-negotiated IDB loan (US$150 million equivalent)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- I1 -&#13;
and by a proposed parallel loan from the Export-Import Bank of Japan (US$75 million equivalent) to be&#13;
negotiated. The State's counterpart expenditures under this program would amount to about US$220&#13;
million over the five-year period, or US$410 million if the supplementary upgrading program is carried out.&#13;
The state's annual capital expenditures on highways would therefore remain below or equivalent to the&#13;
corresponding annual expenditures made during the last three years (Table 3, Annex 4). Also, the State&#13;
currently recovers from road user taxes the total costs of operation, maintenance and rehabilitation of its&#13;
road network, as well as all its road upgrading and construction expenditures.&#13;
E. The State's Highway Concession Program&#13;
2.14   The State Government developed and is implementing a highway concession program which aims&#13;
at increasing private sector participation in the management and financing of highways. The program&#13;
involves about 2,500 km of two-lane highways with traffic volumes of at least 2,000 vehicles per day,&#13;
averaging 3,200 vehicles per day. Of the 2,500 km of roads to be concessioned, about 2,100 km are&#13;
currently under federal jurisdiction, but they have recently been delegated to the State under agreement&#13;
between the Federal and the State Governments. Some of the delegated highways are expected to be&#13;
transferred to the jurisdiction of the state under the decentralization program. The concession program&#13;
comprises about 40 road sections with individual lengths ranging from 50 to 300 km and distributed into&#13;
nine star-shaped systems around major cities. The concessionaires of each system will collect tolls on three&#13;
or more roads converging to the city and will use the proceeds to operate, rehabilitate and maintain the&#13;
concessioned network in good condition. The Government will fix the maintenance condition and minimum&#13;
works required, as well as the initial toll fare, acceptable by users, which will then be adjusted for inflation.&#13;
The concession will be awarded for 15 years to the bidder which proposes to maintain the longest length of&#13;
road within the system. A supervision fee, but no royalty, will be paid to the concessioning authority.&#13;
2.15   DAER determined the operation and maintenance parameters and the investments required over the&#13;
period of the concession on the basis of appropriate engineering and economic analyses, and estimated the&#13;
length of roads that could be effectively operated and maintained by the concessionaire of each system on&#13;
the basis of a financial feasibility analysis. The aggregated cost of operation and maintenance of the 2,500&#13;
km was estimated at about US$40 million equivalent per year. Emergency repairs, signalization and other&#13;
short term investments were estimated at about US$180 million equivalent, and rehabilitation and&#13;
improvements at about US$390 million over the first five years. The concession program has been&#13;
evaluated to be self-supporting, and should be sustained over the long term without subsidies from the State&#13;
Treasury. The Government is currently establishing a State Regulatory Agency to regulate and supervise&#13;
all the state's public service concessions, including roads, and to monitor concessionaire performance, as&#13;
specified in Law no. 10.931 of January 9, 1997. DAER will provide technical support to the regulatory&#13;
agency. The first concession contract (Gramado) has recently been awarded. Bids are currently being&#13;
evaluated for the other eight concessions. The highway concession program was appraised under the&#13;
recently-approved Rio Grande do Sul State Reform Loan (Report No. 6982-BR, pages 38-42). The&#13;
proposed project includes technical assistance and training of staff to assist DAER in providing the&#13;
necessary technical support to the regulatory agency (para. 3.07 and Annex 4).&#13;
F. The Reorganization of the State 'Highway Department&#13;
2.16   The State Highway Department (DAER), a state agency with moderate autonomy, is responsible&#13;
for administering the state's highway network.  DAER developed into a large, rather centralized&#13;
organization in the 1960s and 1970s to administer the state's road construction programs and to maintain&#13;
the road network by force account. In 1995, DAER had a staff of 4,200, many times more than necessary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
if one considers the concession and contract maintenance programs. In addition, an inactive staff of about&#13;
3,800 retirees was also paid from the State Treasury. Altogether, DAER's payroll amounted to about 20%&#13;
of the operating budget. In 1996, about 800 staff left under the state government's incentive program for&#13;
voluntary separation; but further staff reductions are needed. The Government prepared a plan and is&#13;
committed to gradually reduce DAER staff to 1,500 by the end of 2002 (para. 3.08 and Annex 4, Table 2).&#13;
If an amendment to the National Constitution which is currently before the Congress to revise the terms of&#13;
job security for public servants is approved, the Government would be in a position to dismiss redundant&#13;
staff. Otherwise, the Government would develop and implement new incentive schemes for voluntary&#13;
retirement or separation.&#13;
2.17   DAER, like the other highway agencies in Brazil, which have been funded through earmnarked&#13;
revenues from road user taxes until the mid-1980s, never developed an effective capacity for economic&#13;
planning. Political considerations rather than economic analyses have often influenced DAER's&#13;
expenditure programs and priorities, which also contributed to discouraging planning efforts. In the course&#13;
of project preparation, however, DAER started to develop such planning capability to prepare and evaluate&#13;
road expenditure programs on the basis of appropriate economic criteria and methodologies. Similarly,&#13;
DAER will need to reorganize its operations in line with the above-mentioned policy changes, particularly&#13;
with regard to contract maintenance and concessions. In particular, the maintenance units will need to&#13;
gradually phase out their force account capacities and instead strengthen their contract management and&#13;
technical supervision capabilities. The proposed project would include technical assistance to help DAER&#13;
develop and effectively implement the above-mentioned reorganization (para. 3.08 and Annex 3).&#13;
2.18   The reorganization of DAER in order to be successfull will require the effective training of&#13;
DAER's management personnel and technical and administrative staff, emphasizing the following areas:&#13;
(a) network maintenance planning and management systems, techniques of network surveys and pavement&#13;
diagnosis, economic evaluation using the HDM-4 Model; (b) maintenance management systems, including&#13;
procurement, management and supervision of contracts, as well as monitoring of projects and programs; (c)&#13;
environmental management, including environmental cost-benefit analysis and dissemination of&#13;
environmental guidelines for highways; and (d) supervision and monitoring of concession contracts, and&#13;
related regulatory aspects. In the course of project preparation, DAER prepared a training plan for this&#13;
purpose. The project would include a training component to help DAER implement such plan (para. 3.08,&#13;
Annex 3).&#13;
G. Environmental and Safety Management&#13;
2.19   Brazil has appropriate environmental legislation which requires that any major civil works project&#13;
be subject to an appropriate environmental impact assessment to measure its effects on the inhabitants and&#13;
on the natural environment in the project area. The Ministry of Transport and DNER developed&#13;
environmental standards, norms and guidelines respectively for the transport sector and for the highway&#13;
subsector, and they strengthened sectoral capabilities for monitoring compliance with these standards under&#13;
the Highway Management and Rehabilitation Project (Loan No. 3169-BR). On this basis, DAER has&#13;
developed environmental norms for state roads and has established an environmental unit, staffed with two&#13;
qualified specialists, in the engineering division of the Planning Department, to implement them. The unit&#13;
is responsible for supervising the preparation of environmental assessments and the implementation of&#13;
related prevention or mitigatory measures. The state environmental agency (FEPAM) has established a&#13;
small work group for reviewing DAER's environmental assessments, licensing and supervising the works,&#13;
and for enforcing the environmental regulations. The project would include technical assistance and&#13;
training of DAER and FEPAM staff to effectively implement the environmental norms and guidelines&#13;
(para. 3.16).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
2.20   Traffic accidents in Rio Grande do Sul total nearly 6,400 every year, of which about 300 are fatal,&#13;
2,500 involve physical injuries and the remaining 3,600 result in material damage. The engineering designs&#13;
and technical specifications for the rehabilitation works under the proposed project would incorporate&#13;
appropriate safety standards, including adequate pavement markings and vertical signs with special safety&#13;
systems at intersections, bridge and town-crossings. Also, technical assistance is to be provided to DAER&#13;
under a recently-negotiated loan from the IDB for the development of an integrated highway safety program&#13;
and the relaterd training of DAER's staff. Apart from improving traffic safety standards in engineering&#13;
designs, the program will provide for the setting-up of a comprehensive and updated traffic accidents data&#13;
base, as well as the auditing for traffic safety of all road projects.&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Origin, Objectives and Rationale&#13;
3.01   Project Origin. The project's concept originated from the combination of three main factors:&#13;
(a) the broad administrative decentralization, which Brazil initiated with the 1988 Constitution, combined&#13;
with the decision to reduce the federal network to interstate highways and to transfer other highways to&#13;
state jurisdictions, have increased the importance of the states in the management of the road network;&#13;
(b) the experience with the states' highway programs, gained under the Feeder Roads and the recent State&#13;
Highways Management Projects has highlighted the need to allocate adequate priority and resources to the&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance of the state networks and to improve the effectiveness of the road&#13;
maintenance activities of state highway departments; and (c) the recent progress made by the Government&#13;
of Rio Grande do Sul in developing and starting up a broad reform of the state, which provides an&#13;
opportunity to reform the state's highway programs and agency.&#13;
3.02   Project Objectives. The project' s main objective is to improve the serviceability of the state&#13;
highway network with a view to reducing road transport costs, through:&#13;
(a)  more efficient resource allocation and use in the sector;&#13;
(b)  increased participation of the private sector in the management of roads;&#13;
(c)  improved capacity of DAER to manage the state's road programs; and&#13;
(d)  rehabilitation of selected sections and maintenance of the entire paved highway network of the&#13;
state.&#13;
Achievement of these objectives would be measured and monitored during implementation through a set of&#13;
key indicators (para. 4.09 and Annex 4, Table 2).&#13;
3.03   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's country assistance strategy for Brazil, discussed by&#13;
the Board of Executive Directors on June 29, 1995, with an update on June 20, 1996, identifies human&#13;
capital and infrastructure development as the principal bottlenecks to Brazil's social and economic&#13;
development. The emphasis is on structural reforms aimed at stabilization and resumption of broad-based&#13;
growth, including the deregulation and privatization of infrastructure services, efficient allocation of&#13;
resources in the public sector, and on rebuilding and expanding a deteriorated and insufficient&#13;
infrastructure in partnership with the private sector. The proposed project is fully supportive of this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
strategy.  By helping develop and implement efficient state road policies and programs, including&#13;
concessions and contract maintenance, it would deepen the broader reform of the state in the roads sector,&#13;
thus complementing the State Reform Loan. By helping strengthen DAER's technical and management&#13;
capabilities, particularly for maintenance and concessions, the project would contribute to the highway&#13;
decentralization and concessioning objectives of the Federal Government, and complement the proposed&#13;
Federal Highway Rehabilitation and Decentralization Project.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
3.04   The project, a sector operation, would consist of:&#13;
(a)  a policy and institutional development component (2% of total project cost), including technical&#13;
assistance, equipment, software, and training of staff to: (i) prepare and monitor efficient state road&#13;
expenditure and funding programs (SRP) in accordance with policies, standard and economic&#13;
criteria satisfactory to the Bank, thereby strengthening DAER's planning, programming, budgeting&#13;
and monitoring systems; (ii) supervise and monitor the implementation of the state's highway&#13;
concession program and the transfer of maintenance activities to private contractors; and (iii)&#13;
restructure DAER's operations in accordance with the above policy changes, downsizing&#13;
operational divisions and strengthening technical, environmental, management and supervision&#13;
capabilities, and establishing clear goals and accountability to implement and monitor the state's&#13;
highway programs; and&#13;
(b)  a rehabilitation and maintenance component (98% of total project cost), consisting of the&#13;
rehabilitation, resurfacing, and routine maintenance components of the state's 1997-2001 road&#13;
programs, and related studies, engineering designs and works supervision.&#13;
(a)  Policy and Institutional Development&#13;
3.05   The policy and institutional development component would consist of technical assistance, training&#13;
of staff, equipment and software, which are necessary to implement appropriate action programs to achieve&#13;
the above-mentioned development objectives. Agreement was reached during loan negotiations on: (a) the&#13;
objectives of the action programs (paras. 3.06-3.09); and (b) a Project Implementation Plan (PIP) detailing&#13;
the actions to be taken and the timetable (para. 4.03), and the monitoring indicators and targets (Annex 4,&#13;
Table 2), with reference to: (c) the Program Operational Manual (POM), satisfactory to the Bank, defining&#13;
the administrative procedures and technical and economic criteria and methodologies; and (d) the Terms of&#13;
Reference (TOR) for technical assistance and staff training (Annex 3).&#13;
3.06   Preparation and Monitoring of Efficient State Road Programs and Budgets. The objective of&#13;
this action program is to prepare and monitor efficient annual state road expenditure and funding programs&#13;
(SRP), in accordance with policies, standards and economic criteria satisfactory to the Bank, ensuring&#13;
adequate priority to maintenance and rehabilitation, and thereby strengthening DAER's planning,&#13;
programniming, budgeting and monitoring systems. During project preparation, DAER developed efficient&#13;
maintenance policies and a five-year expenditure program using the HDM III model. On this basis, DAER&#13;
would prepare and evaluate each year the state's annual road program (SRP) and the individual&#13;
subprojects, taking into account implementation progress and funding expectations, in accordance with&#13;
policies and economic criteria included in the POM, satisfactory to the Bank. The Bank would review the&#13;
SRPs and related analysis for quality assurance and to ensure that priorities remain adequate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
3.07   Monitoring of Concession and Contract Maintenance Programs. The objective of this action&#13;
program is to supervise and monitor the implementation of the state's highway concession program and the&#13;
gradual transfer of maintenance activities to private contractors. In the course of project preparation,&#13;
DAER developed a program to concession nine networks totaling about 2,500 km, including federal&#13;
highways delegated to the state; bids have been invited and are being evaluated. DAER also contracted out&#13;
the rehabilitation and maintenance for seven years of a network of about 300 km on a pilot basis through a&#13;
performance-type management contract. DAER would, with technical assistance provided under the&#13;
project, supervise and monitor the implementation of the concession program, supervise and evaluate the&#13;
pilot contract maintenance subproject, finalize its maintenance strategy on the basis of the results of the&#13;
pilot subproject, and monitor the transfer of network maintenance operations to private contractors.&#13;
3.08   Reorganization of DAER. The objective of this action program is to restructure DAER's&#13;
operations in accordance with the above policy changes, downsizing operational divisions, strengthening&#13;
technical, management and supervision capabilities, and establishing clear goals and accountability to&#13;
effectively implement and monitor the state's highway programs. DAER's management prepared a&#13;
preliminary organizational restructuring plan, including staff retrenchment targets. DAER, with technical&#13;
assistance provided under the project, will finalize the reorganization plan, including a staffing plan, a staff&#13;
training program, an inventory of physical assets, and an asset sales program.&#13;
3.09   Environmental Management. The objective of this action program is to effectively implement the&#13;
environmental norms and guidelines for the state roads which were prepared by DAER. For this purpose,&#13;
DAER has established an environmental unit and will strengthen it with technical assistance and through&#13;
staff training. The unit will be responsible for coordinating the preparation of environmental assessments&#13;
(EAs) and for supervising the implementation of the prevention and mitigatory measures. Also under the&#13;
project, the state's environmental agency (FEPAM), which has established a work group for roads projects,&#13;
will strengthen its supervision and enforcement capabilities with technical assistance and through&#13;
appropriate training of staff.&#13;
3.10   Project Management. In order to effectively coordinate the implementation of the project, DAER&#13;
would strengthen its Project Management Unit (PMU), which has effectively coordinated project&#13;
preparation, with technical assistance, and finalize its Computerized Project Management System (CPMS).&#13;
(b) Rehabilitation and Maintenance Program&#13;
3.11   The rehabilitation and maintenance program would include rehabilitation and resurfacing works on&#13;
segments of the paved network, and routine maintenance activities on the entire paved network. In the&#13;
course of project preparation, DAER has developed appropriate network maintenance strategies with the&#13;
help of the HDM III model. The maintenance strategies for the paved network consist of carrying out:&#13;
(a) resurfacing works on paved sections which would otherwise soon reach a level of deterioration requiring&#13;
extensive rehabilitation, through appropriate slurry seal, surface treatment, or asphalt concrete overlay&#13;
techniques, depending upon traffic levels; (b) pavement rehabilitation works on sections which have already&#13;
reached or exceeded their lifetime, through appropriate techniques ranging from asphalt concrete overlays&#13;
to complete reconstruction of pavement; and (c) routine maintenance works as needed. The maintenance&#13;
and rehabilitation strategies are discussed and evaluated in Annex 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
3.12    The state government intends to carry&#13;
out the entire rehabilitation program  over a            Table 3.1: Rehabitation and Maintenance Program&#13;
period of five years. The resulting five-year                        ifflometers)&#13;
program  is presented in Annex 2, and is   ConDonent           1997    1998   1999   2000    2001   Total&#13;

program  has an aggregated scope of about&#13;
2,540 km for rehabilitation and resurfacing,   Resusfacing       50      300    439    439      475  1,703&#13;

maintenance.       The   rehabilitation   and&#13;
maintenance program  will be reviewed and updated annually on the basis of the gradually improved&#13;
information and analytical tools of the pavement and mnaintenance planning systems, implementation&#13;
progress and updated funding expectations. They will be presented to the Bank for review as part of the&#13;
annual state road programs.&#13;
3.13    First-year program. The first-year program would include rehabilitation and resurfacing works&#13;
on the highest priority road sections which need urgent attention. It would consist of 19 subprojects&#13;
totaling about 463 km in length, and a total estimated cost of about US$25 million (Annex 2, section E).&#13;
The majority of these roads are located in the north and northeast part of the state, and presently carry&#13;
volumes of traffic ranging from 2,000 to 5,000 vehicles/day. They also exhibit high deflection, above 0.6&#13;
mm, and high roughness values, usually between 3.5 and 5 IRI. The works, which would be carried out&#13;
during 1997-1998, will generally consist of 4 to 8 cm thick asphalt concrete overlays. The increase in&#13;
structural strength provided by the overlays will help the pavements to withstand traffic loading over the&#13;
next 10 years.&#13;
C. Project Cost and Financing&#13;
3.14    The total cost of the project is estimated at&#13;
US$168 million equivalent, including US$120 million          Table 3.1: Estinated Project Costs and Financing&#13;

prevailing local and foreign specialist-month rates, and those for training are based on unit prices of recent&#13;
contracts. Project cost estimates are detailed in Table 1, Annex 4, and are summarized in Table 3.1&#13;
herewith.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
3.15 The project would be financed from the proposed Bank loan of US$70 million (42% of project&#13;
cost) and from State Government counterpart funds (US$97.9 million or 58%). The project financing plan&#13;
is shown in Table 1, Annex 4, and is summarized in Table 3.1 above. The Bank loan would be disbursed&#13;
against: (a) rehabilitation and resurfacing works at the rate of 50% of total payments (US$60.0 million);&#13;
(b) supply of goods at the rate of 100% of foreign or local (ex-factory cost) expenditures and 85% of other&#13;
local expenditures (US$ 1.0 million); (c) studies at the rate of 50% of total payments (US$6.0 million); and&#13;
(d) technical assistance and training at the rate of 100% of total expenditures (US$3.0 million). The State&#13;
Government would fund 100% the maintenance of the network and provide counterpart funds for project&#13;
components partly financed by the Bank. Supplementary financing would be provided under the recently&#13;
approved Rio Grande do Sul State Reform Loan (Loan No. 4139) for the rehabilitation and resurfacing&#13;
works in an amount not exceeding US$15 million equivalent. Agreement was reached during loan&#13;
negotiations on: (a) Borrower guarantee of counterpart funds; and (b) in order to enable starting up urgent&#13;
rehabilitation works and technical assistance, retroactive financing, in an amount not exceeding US$7.0&#13;
million equivalent (10% of the loan amount), for works and consultant and training expenditures incurred&#13;
after March 1, 1997 and not earlier than twelve months before the signing of the loan agreement.&#13;
D. Environmental and Economic Analyses&#13;
3.16   Environmental Analysis. The project works, which consist of the maintenance and rehabilitation&#13;
of existing roads, would not have significant impacts on the environment. The project has been rated "B"&#13;
by the Bank for environmental assessment purposes.  The environmental impacts of road works are&#13;
primarily related to quarries and borrow pits, disposal of used pavement materials and other wastes, and&#13;
the activities of road crews. Prior to inviting bids, DAER will revise its norms and specifications for road&#13;
engineering and works in order to incorporate appropriate requirements for environmental quality of the&#13;
works, make payments to contractors subject to compliance with these requirements, and will carry out&#13;
adequate supervision and control. The institutional component of the project, by strengthening DAER's&#13;
environmental management capacity and FEPAM's road-related functions through technical assistance and&#13;
staff training, is expected to help prevent or mitigate the adverse environmental impacts of the state's road&#13;
programs, including their components which are not part of the proposed project.&#13;
3.17   Project Benefits. The objective of the project is to improve the serviceability of the state highway&#13;
network with a view to reduce the cost of road transport and consequently support the resumption of&#13;
growth in agriculture, industry and exports.  Road users, and producers and consumers of goods&#13;
transported by road, will benefit from reduced vehicle operating costs and from passenger time savings, as&#13;
well as from fewer accidents and improved comfort. DAER, the Government, and ultimately taxpayers&#13;
will benefit from the reduced recurrent costs of maintaining rehabilitated or resurfaced road sections, and&#13;
from highway concessions. Although they are not easily quantifiable, the benefits from economic growth&#13;
induced by the reduction of road transport and logistics costs could also be important, especially with the&#13;
new opportunities resulting from the Southern Cone Trade Agreement (MERCOSUR). Both the policy and&#13;
institutional and the rehabilitation and maintenance components of the project, which are not separable,&#13;
would contribute to the above benefits.&#13;
3.18   Economic Analysis. The design of the project was optimized through the economic analysis. The&#13;
methodology consisted in comparing the Net Present Value (NPV) of altemative network rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance strategies and associated programs, and selecting the strategies which maximize the NPV&#13;
under various budget constraints. The costs and benefits of each altemative were quantified with the help&#13;
of the Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance Standards (HDM III) Model. The optimum rehabilitation&#13;
and maintenance strategy and associated program for the agreed budget constraint (US$25 million per&#13;
year) was then selected using the Expenditure Budgeting Model (EBM) (Annex 2, sections A to C). The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
selected alternative would reduce the portion of the network in very poor condition (IRI superior to 5) from&#13;
5% to 2.5% and would increase the portion in good condition (IRI inferior to 3) from 52% to 85% at&#13;
project completion. If the project is not undertaken, the portion of the network in poor condition would&#13;
increase to about 50% by 2001, the vehicle operating costs would increase by over 10%, and the&#13;
subsequent costs of rehabilitation and maintenance of the network would be twice the costs of the project,&#13;
i.e. about US$50 million per year. Accounting only for the direct benefits, the project has an estimated Net&#13;
Present Value (NPV) of about US$615 million at a 12 percent discount rate, and an estimated Internal&#13;
Economic Rate of Return (IERR) of about 98 percent (Annex 2, sections D and E). The project costs&#13;
would have to be about eight times higher, or the project benefits eight times lower, than the appraisal&#13;
estimates for the NPV to become negative; these are highly unlikely scenarios.&#13;
E. Project Risks&#13;
3.19   Risks. The main risks are: (a) Government failure to provide the necessary counterpart funds,&#13;
especially in the event that the reform of the state is reversed; (b) DAER's ineffective management of the&#13;
project; and (c) unexpected problems, including legal challenges, in implementing the road concession&#13;
and/or contract maintenance programs. To minimize these risks, the experience acquired with completed&#13;
and ongoing highway projects has been incorporated in the project's design. In particular, the scope of the&#13;
project has been limited to the essential rehabilitation and maintenance of the existing road network,&#13;
excluding the highway sections which will be concessioned. Counterpart fund requirements will therefore&#13;
be minimal as compared to recent public expenditures in the sector. The recently-approved Rio Grande do&#13;
Sul State Reform Loan will also help ensure appropriate allocation of public resources, including&#13;
counterpart funds for the proposed project. A detailed Project Implementation Plan has been agreed on,&#13;
which includes organizational arrangements to strengthen DAER's key planning, management and control&#13;
systems, and well-defined indicators and conservative targets to monitor procurement, physical and&#13;
financial execution of work programs, network condition, and institutional performance. With the&#13;
proposed technical assistance and training program, DAER is expected to have adequate project&#13;
management and implementation capabilities. A comprehensive Program Operational Manual, improved&#13;
with the experience acquired under previous projects, will provide effective guidance for project&#13;
implementation. Annual reviews of the State's road expenditure and funding programs would be carried&#13;
out at the time of budget preparation to ensure adequate budget allocations. The Bank will have the right&#13;
to exercise appropriate remedies, including suspension of disbursements or cancellation, if the Borrower&#13;
defaults on the obligation to achieve the agreed targets.&#13;
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
A. Institutional Responsibilities&#13;
4.01   The State Government, through the state road agency (DAER), would be directly responsible for&#13;
implementing the project in accordance with the Project Implementation Plan (PIP), including&#13;
organizational arrangements (section B), a Project Implementation Action Plan (section C), procurement&#13;
arrangements (section D), disbursement, accounting and audit arrangements (section E), and project&#13;
monitoring and reporting arrangements (section F), for which detailed guidelines are provided in the POM.&#13;
The Bank would monitor and supervise project implementation in accordance with the project monitoring&#13;
and supervision plan (section F). The Loan Agreement between the State of Rio Grande do Sul and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
Bank would specify all the above. The Federal Government would guarantee the loan through a Guarantee&#13;
Agreement between the Federative Republic of Brazil and the Bank.&#13;
B. Organizational Arrangements&#13;
4.02   DAER has set up appropriate organizational arrangements to carry out the project. DAER has&#13;
established and would maintain an appropriately staffed Project Management Unit (PMU) headed by a&#13;
qualified and experienced project manager, who reports directly to DAER's Director-General. DAER has&#13;
assigned and would maintain staff with adequate qualifications and experience to coordinate DAER's&#13;
technical support to the Government's highway concession program. DAER has also established an&#13;
environmental unit responsible for the implementation of the environmental norms and guidelines. With&#13;
these arrangements and the proposed technical assistance, DAER will have the capacity needed to carry out&#13;
the project efficiently. Assurances were obtained during loan negotiations that DAER would maintain&#13;
organizational arrangements for project execution satisfactory to the Bank, including: (a) a Project&#13;
Management Unit, with TOR and staffing, and headed by a project manager with qualifications and&#13;
experience, satisfactory to the Bank; (b) staff with adequate qualifications and experience for coordinating&#13;
DAER's technical support to the Government's highway concession program; and (c) an environmental&#13;
unit with adequately-trained professionals responsible for coordinating the implementation of the&#13;
enviromnental norms and guidelines.&#13;
C. Project Implementation Action Plan&#13;
4.03   The State Government is committed to carrying the project in accordance with the Project&#13;
Implementation Action Plan which is summarized hereafter, and with the project implementation&#13;
monitoring indicators and targets presented in Annex 5, Table 2. The actions summarized below have been&#13;
confirmed during loan negotiations:&#13;
(a) Preparation and Review of State Road Programs and Budgets&#13;
(i) DAER will: by April 30 of each year, carry out a survey of its road network's surface and&#13;
structural condition, traffic and accidents, and organize the results of such surveys in a&#13;
computerized road database, in accordance with guidelines set forth in the POM; and, by August&#13;
15 of each year, prepare the state road program (SRP) in accordance with policies and economic&#13;
criteria set forth in the POM, and with the annual physical implementation and funding targets set&#13;
forth in the PIP, and present such SRP together with the survey results to the Bank for comments,&#13;
and&#13;
(ii) The Borrower will take into account DAER's programs and the Bank's comments in preparing its&#13;
annual budget proposals, and DAER will implement the SRP so as to achieve the implementation&#13;
targets set forth in the PIP.&#13;
(b) Monitoring of Concession and Contract Maintenance Programs&#13;
(i) DAER will provide technical support to the Government's highway concession program, so as to&#13;
achieve the concession tendering targets set forth in the PIP; and&#13;
(ii) DAER will, by December 31, 1997, present to the Bank for comments a plan to contract out the&#13;
maintenance of the road network, and thereafter, taking into account the comments of the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
carry out through private contractors the maintenance of an annually increasing portion of the&#13;
network under its jurisdiction in accordance with the targets set forth in the PIP.&#13;
(c)  Reorganization of DAER&#13;
(i) The Borrower will, by June 30, 1998, present to the Bank for comments a plan to restructure&#13;
DAER's operations, including a staffing plan, a training program, an inventory of DAER's&#13;
physical assets, an asset sales program, and a timetable, and thereafter implement it, taking into&#13;
account the Bank's comments; and&#13;
(ii) The Borrower will keep the total number of DAER staff within the agreed annually-decreasing&#13;
targets set forth in the PIP.&#13;
(d)  Strengthening of Environmental Management&#13;
(i) DAER will, prior to inviting bids for road works but in any event not later than December 31,&#13;
1997, put into effect environmental norms and guidelines for state roads, satisfactory to the Bank,&#13;
and incorporate these norms and guidelines in the general specifications for engineering and works&#13;
contracts; and&#13;
(ii) DAER, through its environmental unit, will ensure the effective implementation of the&#13;
environmental norms and guidelines, including the preparation of appropriate environmental impact&#13;
assessments for its major road projects.&#13;
(e) Project Management and Monitoring&#13;
(i) DAER will establish a computerized project management system to plan, monitor and report on&#13;
project implementation, in accordance with guidelines included in the POM, not later than 90 days&#13;
after the date of the loan effectiveness, and inform the Bank through quarterly progress reports, as&#13;
specified in the POM; and&#13;
(ii) in order to carry out the above action programs efficiently, DAER will, by December 31, 1997,&#13;
have contracted one or several consulting firms in accordance with Bank Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants (August 1981) and on the basis of terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
(f)  Preparation and Economic Evaluation of Specific Investments&#13;
(i) DAER will select the road segments to be included in the annual rehabilitation and resurfacing&#13;
programs on the basis of the results of the surveys and the technical and economic criteria and&#13;
methodologies specified in the POM;&#13;
(ii) Prior to initiating detailed engineering designs, DAER will prepare and submit to the Bank draft&#13;
applications in a fortn specified in the POM providing information on each proposed investment in&#13;
the annual program. The Bank will approve the financing of the engineering designs under the loan&#13;
on the basis of a review of the draft applications;&#13;
(iii) After completing detailed engineering designs and prior to contracting the works, DAER will&#13;
finalize the applications as required to reflect the final engineering designs and cost estimates, and&#13;
present them to the Bank. The Bank will approve the financing of the investments under the loan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
on the basis of the review of the final application forms. All the investments included in the&#13;
subprojects would have estimated internal economic rates of return exceeding 12 percent.&#13;
D. Procurement Arrangements&#13;
4.04   Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.1 hereafter.&#13;
4.05    All civil works estimated&#13;
to cost US$5 .0 million or more                              Table 4.1: Procurement Method&#13;

through   National  Competitive   _&#13;
Bidding (NCB) procedures, based on standard bidding documents, which were approved by the Bank and&#13;
are included in the POM. Works estimated to cost less than US$350,000 per contract, up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$3.0 million, may be procured under lump-sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of&#13;
price quotations from at least three eligible contractors. The value of individual civil works contracts is&#13;
expected to vary between US$0.3 and US$10.0 million (total cost about US$120.0 million). Miscellaneous&#13;
road laboratory and office equipment and software would be purchased by shopping on the basis of price&#13;
quotations from at least three eligible suppliers, when they cannot be packaged in contracts exceeding&#13;
US$100,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$1.0 million. NCB procedures would be used for contracts&#13;
for goods exceeding US$100,000 and below US$350,000 in the event that such contracts are required.&#13;
Consultants for detailed engineering, construction supervision, technical assistance and training programs&#13;
would be selected and engaged following Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August 1981) and&#13;
the standard contract issued by the Bank would be used for complex, time-based assignments.&#13;
4.06   DAER is the principal implementing agency, responsible for carrying out the project, including all&#13;
procurement. DAER's organization for and experience with procurement were reviewed during appraisal&#13;
and found to be satisfactory. The Borrower's procurement law (Law no. 8.666 of June 21, 1993)&#13;
specifically authorizes executing agencies to procure goods and services financed by multilateral&#13;
institutions in accordance with the norms and procedures of the financial institutions. All ICB contracts,&#13;
the first two NCB contracts for civil works, all contracts for goods estimated at US$350,000 equivalent or&#13;
more, all contracts with consulting firms estimated at US$100,000 equivalent or more, and all contracts&#13;
with individual consultants estimated at US$50,000 or more would be subject to the Bank's prior review of&#13;
all procurement documentation and decisions. These prior-review arrangements would cover contracts&#13;
totaling about 65% of the total cost of Bank-financed works, goods and services. The balance of contracts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
would be subject to selective ex-post review by the Bank after contract award. Agreement was reached&#13;
with the Borrower during loan negotiations on the above procurement arrangements.&#13;
E. Disbursements, Accounting and Audit Arrangements&#13;
4.07   Within the 50% of cost sharing, net of taxes and duties, the Bank would disburse for: (a) civil&#13;
works, at the rate of 50% of total expenditures; (b) equipment, at the rate of 100% of foreign expenditures&#13;
and 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory cost, excluding taxes), and 85% of other local expenditures;&#13;
and (c) consultant services and staff training at the rates of 100% of expenditures for technical assistance&#13;
and training, and 50% of expenditures for studies, engineering designs and works supervision. The&#13;
allocations of the proceeds of each loan is shown in Table 3, Annex 4. Based upon experience with similar&#13;
projects and the relevant standard disbursement profile for highway projects, the implementation period for&#13;
the project is estimated at six years. The project completion date would be June 30, 2002, and the Closing&#13;
Date would be December 31, 2002. The loan disbursement schedule is shown in Table 4, Annex 4.&#13;
4.08   In order to reduce the interval during which the Borrowers would finance the Bank's share of&#13;
subproject cost with their own resources, the Borrower would establish a Special Account (SA) in US&#13;
dollars in a commercial bank to cover local and foreign currency expenditures of the project. The Bank&#13;
would deposit up to US$6.0 million in the SA. The Bank would replenish the SA for the amount of&#13;
withdrawals on account of eligible expenditures at the request of the Borrower. DAER has adequate&#13;
accounting control to enable disbursement to be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures.&#13;
Supporting documentation with respect to expenditures against contracts valued at up to US$5.0 million&#13;
equivalent for civil works, US$350,000 equivalent for goods, and US$100,000 equivalent for consulting&#13;
firm services, and US$50,000 for individual consultants would be retained by DAER, be available for&#13;
inspection during project supervision missions, and be subject to auditing by DAER's extemal auditors.&#13;
Expenditures for contracts above these limits would be documented. During loan negotiations, agreement&#13;
would be sought with the Borrower on: (a) the above disbursement arrangements; and (b) DAER to retain&#13;
independent auditors, acceptable to the Bank, to audit the project accounts, Special Account and&#13;
Statements of Expenditures, and to furnish the auditors reports to the Bank not later than six months after&#13;
the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
F. Monitoring and Supervision Plan&#13;
4.09   The Bank would monitor and supervise the implementation of the project in accordance with the&#13;
Monitoring and Supervision Plan presented in Annex 5. The Bank would monitor the implementation of&#13;
the project against the time schedule and the monitoring indicators and targets, which are set forth in the&#13;
PIP (Chart 1, Table 2, Annex 4). The estimates of Bank monitoring and supervision inputs into key&#13;
activities are shown in the Table 1, Annex 5.&#13;
4.10   DAER is developing and would establish an appropriate Computerized Project Management&#13;
System (CPMS) to manage the implementation of the project. The system is designed to produce adequate&#13;
information to report to DAER management, the Government, and to the Bank to permit effective&#13;
monitoring of project implementation against the agreed monitoring indicators and targets.  During&#13;
negotiations, agreement would be sought with the Borrower on: (a) the CPMS to be fully installed not later&#13;
than 90 days after the date of effectiveness of the loan ; and (b) quarterly progress reports satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank, to be sent not later than one month after the end of each quarter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
4.11   In supervising the implementation of the project, the Bank would in particular review the following&#13;
documents: (a) the state's annual road programs and budgets; (b) the applications forms for specific&#13;
investments included in the annual programs and related documentation; (c) procurement documentation for&#13;
contracts under the rehabilitation and resurfacing programs, ex-ante for all ICB-procured and the first two&#13;
NCB-procured contracts, and ex-post, on a sample basis, for other NCB-procured contracts; (d) terms of&#13;
reference, invitation letters, short-lists, proposal evaluation reports and draft contracts for consultant and&#13;
staff training services, in accordance with the prior-review thresholds set forth in para 4.06.&#13;
4.12   A comprehensive Mid-Term review of the implementation of the project would be carried out by&#13;
December 1999 or when 50 percent of the loan amount has been disbursed, whichever is earlier. The&#13;
review would cover all the agreed actions, target dates, and implementation indicators included in the PIP&#13;
and the status of compliance with all covenants of the Loan Agreement. Particular importance would be&#13;
given to: (a) the Borrower's commnitment to provide adequate funds for maintenance and rehabilitation;&#13;
(b) DAER's performance under the institutional development component, including staff reductions,&#13;
training and technical assistance; and (c) progress under the rehabilitation and maintenance programs. The&#13;
Borrower would be committed to implement all the proposed measures as necessary to ensure the efficient&#13;
completion of the project and the attainment of its objectives. The Bank would have the right to exercise&#13;
appropriate remedies if performance is not satisfactory.&#13;
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
5.01   During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government of Rio Grande do Sul on the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a)  preparation and annual review of the state road programs and budgets, and related policies,&#13;
criteria, and methodologies (paras. 3.06, 4.03 (a) and Table 2, Annex 4);&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RIO GRANDE DO SUL STATE HIGHWAY MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Bank Experience with Highway Projects in Brazil&#13;
A. Highway Project Summaries&#13;
1.    The Bank approved twelve loans for highways and three loans for feeder roads in Brazil&#13;
between 1968 and 1991. This section provides a summary for each project.&#13;
2.    The First Highway Project (Loan 567-BR, US$26 million, October 1968) was instrumental in&#13;
setting the framework for Bank involvement in the Brazilian transport sector. Together with this loan,&#13;
the Bank reached agreement with the Government on a Plan of Action which included, among other&#13;
elements, the reorganization of DNER, the revision of road-user charges, the reduction of railway&#13;
deficits and the improvement of port administration. The project included detailed engineering,&#13;
construction, paving, and supervision of seven road sections totaling 429 km in four states. The&#13;
project was successfully completed in September 1972, about a year later than expected. The delay&#13;
was mainly due to design changes and problems with earthworks. Despite cost overruns in some&#13;
sections, total project costs were lower than anticipated. The audit reestimated rates of return for the&#13;
roads were, except for one road, equal to or higher than the appraisal estimates; they ranged from 14%&#13;
to 40% (PPAR No.626 dated Feb.12, 1976).&#13;
3.         The Second Highway Project (Loan 676-BR, US$100 million, May 1970) included&#13;
construction and paving of 2,136 km of roads, detailed engineering of 2,369 km, and feasibility studies&#13;
of 3,256 km. The project provided technical assistance to strengthen the planning and supervisory&#13;
capabilities of DNER. Problems were encountered during construction, and delays occurred. As a&#13;
result, the project was not completed until August 1976, two years behind schedule. Final cost was&#13;
about 6% above appraisal estimates. The audit rate of return for the project was higher than the&#13;
appraisal estimate (36% as against 27%), mainly because of much higher-than-anticipated traffic&#13;
growth. This was the first major road project carried out entirely by Brazilian firms under strict&#13;
specifications and quality controls agreed with the Bank. The experiences gained by the Brazilian&#13;
construction industry and DNER during the execution of the project were considerable, as&#13;
demonstrated by the performance of follow-up projects (PPAR No. 644, dated June 21, 1977, PCR&#13;
dated October 27, 1976).&#13;
4.    The Third and Fourth Highway Projects (Loan 813-BR, US$89 million, April 1972, and&#13;
Loan 854-BR, US$51 million, August 1972) included construction of 1,849 km, paving of 681 km of&#13;
roads, and related supervision. Civil works in both projects faced the same problems encountered&#13;
during the Second Highway Project. Completion of both projects, initially scheduled for 1976, was at&#13;
the end of 1977. Underestimation of physical quantities and acceleration of inflation in 1973 and 1974&#13;
caused substantial cost overruns. Reestimated rates of return, however, were considerably above&#13;
appraisal estimates: 45% and 29% against 25% and 16% respectively. The PPAR noted that&#13;
inadequate detailed engineering for these two projects contributed to substantial quantity and cost&#13;
increases. It also pointed out deficiencies in traffic forecasting (PCR dated May 30, 1978, PPAR No.&#13;
2571 of June 8, 1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -                                Annex 1&#13;
5.     The Fifth Highway Project (Loan 1075-BR, US$110 million, January 1975) set the basis for&#13;
Bank involvement in road maintenance, rehabilitation and strengthening. The project included: (a)&#13;
construction and upgrading of 612 km of federal highways; (b) highway maintenance and rehabilitation&#13;
programs in the States of Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul and technical assistance to DNER to&#13;
improve maintenance planning; (c) Phase I of a Weighing Station Program; (d) detailed engineering for&#13;
road construction, upgrading and rehabilitation; and (e) feasibility studies for three new highways&#13;
totaling about 900 km. The project achieved its original objective in upgrading, and increasing the&#13;
capacity of, congested road links included in the project, although these works were completed with&#13;
about three years' delay and substantial cost overuns. The technical assistance achieved less than&#13;
expected, partly because the systems developed by consultants were too complicated and did not take&#13;
local conditions into account. Largely because of inadequate preparation, the weigh bridge program&#13;
was delayed and only partially completed, with significant cost overuns (PCR dated May 8, 1985).&#13;
6.    The Secondary and Feeder Roads Project (Loan 1207-BR, US$55 million, March 1976) was&#13;
conceived as a line of credit extended to Brazil's National Economic Development Bank, BNDES, to&#13;
finance about 50% of subloans extended by BNDES to state DERs or municipal road consortia to carry&#13;
out secondary and feeder road programs in support of agricultural production.  Subprojects were&#13;
prepared and evaluated in accordance with agreed and well-publicized criteria embodied in a manual.&#13;
The loan helped finance 18 subprojects in 12 States comprising 5,400 km of roads and 110 separate&#13;
bridges. The project was slow in starting because beneficiaries took more time than anticipated to&#13;
establish their working relationships with BNDES. Implementation has also been slowed by financial&#13;
problems, which were resolved through the Bank's Special Assistance Program, by providing&#13;
supplementary subloans under the Second Feeder Road Project. The project was completed in mid-&#13;
1984, with a three-and-a-half year delay (PCR dated June 14, 1985, PPAR dated September 23, 1986).&#13;
7.      The Sixth Highway Project (Loan 1557-BR, US$114 million, August 1978) continued to&#13;
support rehabilitation and maintenance. The project included (a) rehabilitation of about 2,300 km of&#13;
paved federal highways and detailed engineering for another 3,000 km of rehabilitation works; (b) a&#13;
highway maintenance and rehabilitation program in the State of Parana; (c) Phase II of the Weighing&#13;
Station Program; and (d) consulting services to the Road Research Institute (IPR) to carry out research&#13;
on pavement overlay design and to GEIPOT to complete research on the Highway Design and&#13;
Maintenance Model.  Project implementation was delayed from the start,  because of lack of&#13;
counterpart funding, until mid-1983 when the Bank's Special Action Program, by increasing&#13;
disbursement percentages, helped the project to be completed in the second half of 1985. The weigh&#13;
bridge program remained incomplete. DNER's pavement research program, completed in late 1984,&#13;
introduced a new standard for pavement overlay design. DER-Parana's maintenance operations were&#13;
successfully strengthened (PCR dated March 20, 1987, PPAR dated November 16, 1989).&#13;
8.      The Second Feeder Roads Project (Loan 1730-BR, US$110 million, June 1979) was to&#13;
provide continuity to the program initiated by the First Project and implemented through BNDES. The&#13;
19 subprojects in 13 states together consisted of the construction or improvement of 255 road links&#13;
totaling about 4,900 km, and of the construction of 370 bridges. Lack of counterpart funds slowed&#13;
down implementation in 1982 and 1983. The Bank's Special Assistance Program helped resolve the&#13;
funding problems. Part of the loan was used to provide supplementary financing under the first&#13;
Project. The project was completed and the loan fully disbursed by the end of 1986, in line with the&#13;
appraisal schedule. By requiring economic analyses and appropriate engineering standards, the first&#13;
and second projects helped state road administrations improve planning, engineering and management&#13;
of feeder roads programs country-wide. But maintenance capabilities remained weak in many states&#13;
(PCR dated November 6, 1989, PPAR No. 9367 dated February 15, 1991).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

9.     The Northwest Region Development Program, Highway Project (Loan 2062-BR, US$240&#13;
million, November 1981), consisted of: (a) construction of the Campinas-Ariquemes section (about&#13;
1,084 km) of the Northwest Highway, BR-364; (b) strengthening of Rondonia State Highway&#13;
Department (DER-RO); and (c) construction and improvement of about 1,000 km of roads in the States&#13;
of Rondonia and Mato Grosso through BNDES' feeder roads program. The construction of the&#13;
Northwest Highway, after initial delays due to inadequate funding, accelerated in the second half of&#13;
1983 with the Bank's Special Action Program, and was completed in late 1984, one year ahead of&#13;
schedule. The program for strengthening the State Highway Department of Rondonia made little&#13;
progress due to delays in contracting the consultants and to subsequent suspension of disbursements for&#13;
delays under environmental components of the Northwest Region Development Program. The feeder&#13;
road component was completed on schedule. In mid-1985, the Bank agreed to re-allocate about US$60&#13;
million of loan savings for an emergency flood rehabilitation program in six Northeastern states, which&#13;
was completed by mid-1987. The highway project upgraded the region's transport system but the&#13;
Northwest Development Program, of which the project was only one component, failed in its basic&#13;
objective of harmoniously developing the region. The improvement of the highway and feeder roads&#13;
and failures or delays in implementing the environmental and indigenous people protection programs&#13;
under the associated projects led to a destructive and disordely colonization process, with long-term&#13;
damage to the environment, encroachment onto Amerindian and natural reserves, and concentration of&#13;
migrants in ill-equipped urban settlements (PCR dated April 15, 1991).&#13;
10.       The Third Feeder Roads Project (Loan 2224-BR, US$154 million, December 1982)&#13;
supported the continuation of the National Feeder Roads Program, administered by BNDES, including&#13;
strengthening of project management. The project was to build or improve 8,000 km of roads at a cost&#13;
of about US$500 million over the period 1983-mid 1989, and to improve the maintenance capability of&#13;
subborrowers through technical assistance for advisory services and training of staff . The project was&#13;
implemented expeditiously, within the original timeframe. Physical results exceeded targets by more&#13;
than 20%. Almost 10,000 km of roads were built or improved, 70% in the low income states in the&#13;
North, Northeast and Center-West regions. The three feeder roads projects helped develop state&#13;
capacities for preparing, evaluating and implementing feeder roads programs on the basis of&#13;
appropriate selection criteria and methodologies, and technical norms and standards.  BNDES&#13;
strengthened its management of the program, but the fiscal reform and decentralization introduced with&#13;
the 1988 constitution led to the termination of the program (PCR dated June 11, 1993).&#13;
11.       The Federal Highways Sector Project (Loan 2446-BR, US$210 million, June 1984)&#13;
supported DNER's 1984-1987 Investment Program, including highway rehabilitation, road safety,&#13;
training of DNER and state highway maintenance personnel, and technical assistance for a pavement&#13;
management system, an equipment management system, and highway research studies. Implementation&#13;
was expeditious, despite DNER budget cuts on several occasions.  Physical targets of highway&#13;
rehabilitation were exceeded by one-fifth. Procurement led to lower-than-expected bid prices but&#13;
subsequent contract modifications led to increased costs. The impact of road safety investments was&#13;
difficult to judge because of the absence of monitoring. The training program for the DERs was&#13;
successful, but DNER gave priority to physical investments over technical assistance, which had&#13;
minimum results (PCR dated June 15, 1992).&#13;
12.   The Sao Paulo State Highway Management Project (Loan 2830-BR, US$174 million, June&#13;
1987) comprised: (a) rehabilitation and periodic maintenance works on about 5,100 km of state&#13;
highways; (b) equipment rehabilitation; (c) training of highway staff; and (d) technical assistance for&#13;
transport sector policy, planning and operations, pavement and bridge management systems, and road&#13;
research. The project started only in July 1988 due to administrative difficulties for loan signing. It&#13;
made good progress until mid-1991, but remained virtually stalled until early 1995 due to the serious&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -                                  Annex 1&#13;
financial difficulties of the state. Implementation resumed in 1995, after the state government cleared&#13;
significant arrears owed to contractors and the Bank extended the closing date to December 1995. The&#13;
scope of the project was reduced, and about US$32 million was canceled from the loan. In spite of the&#13;
implementation difficulties, 4,000 km of roads were rehabilitated, reducing the portion of the network&#13;
in poor condition from about 40% to 6%, and the institutional component was substantially completed&#13;
at closing (PCR dated October 25, 1996).&#13;
13.   The Highway Management and Rehabilitation Project (Loan 3169-BR, US$310 million,&#13;
February 1990, closed December 31, 1996) helped redefine the federal highway network, restructure&#13;
the national highway department, rehabilitate and maintain highways in major transport corridors,&#13;
improve sector policy formulation and strategic planning, and develop and improve compliance with&#13;
environmental standards in the transport sector.  Project startup was delayed by modifications&#13;
requested by the incoming government and approved by the Board. Implementation was affected by&#13;
Government stabilization efforts and consequent insufficient counterpart fund transfers.   But&#13;
implementation improved after the Bank increased disbursement percentages and canceled US$40&#13;
million from the loan in early 1995. The appraisal targets for the works were met or exceeded. The&#13;
policy and institutional component, which had been affected by the numerous changes of sector&#13;
administration, was also succesfully completed.&#13;
14.   The State Highway Management Project (Loans 3547-BR and 3548-BR, US$88 million,&#13;
December 1992) is helping rehabilitate and maintain the state highway networks in the states of Santa&#13;
Catarina and Alagoas, and to strengthen the state highway agencies' (DERs) planning, contract&#13;
maintenance and environmental management capabilities.   Both the physical and institutional&#13;
components of the Santa Catarina subproject have progressed satisfactorily in spite of the recent&#13;
financial difficulties of the state. But progress under the Alagoas subproject has been unsatisfactory.&#13;
Because of the financial difficulties of the State and insufficient counterpart funding in 1994-95, a&#13;
number of rehabilitation contracts had to be terminated. The subproject was restructured in early&#13;
1996, increasing disbursement percentages and cancelling US$18 million from the loan. The reforms&#13;
introduced by the state government in 1996 have enabled the works to be re-tendered and re-initiated in&#13;
accordance with the available counterpart funds. The institutional component, which initially made&#13;
slow progress due to the numerous changes of administration, is now progressing satisfactorily.&#13;
15.   The State Highway Management II Project (Loans 3713-BR, 3714-BR &amp; 3715-BR, US$220&#13;
million,  March 1994) is assisting the states of Piaui, Tocantins and Maranhao to develop and&#13;
implement efficient road expenditure programs, with adequate priority to maintenance, and to&#13;
strengthen the planning, contract maintenance and environmental management capabilities of the states'&#13;
highway agencies. Project startup has been satisfactory in the three states. The monetary reform&#13;
introduced with the Plano Real in mid-1995, however, has substantially affected the financial capacities&#13;
of the states, particularly Piaui and, to a lesser extent, Maranhao. Implementation targets at the end of&#13;
1995 were substantially met in Tocantins. But the two subprojects in Piaui and Maranhao were&#13;
restructured in November 1995 in line with the states' financial capacities, reducing the upgrading and&#13;
paving targets while keeping maintenance and rehabilitation targets, canceling US$18 million from&#13;
each loan, and increasing disbursement percentages. With this project restructuring and the reform&#13;
measures introduced by the state governments, the performance of the two subprojects substantially&#13;
improved in 1996 and is now satisfactory.&#13;
B. Lessons Learned&#13;
15.   The following important lessons learned from the experience with the above projects have been&#13;
incorporated into the design and preparation of the proposed project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -                                  Annex 1&#13;
16.   Counterpart Funding, Budgets. The counterpart funding problems have been recurrent and&#13;
have adversely affected the implementation of the physical investment components of most projects.&#13;
Government efforts to contain public expenditures in order to achieve important economic stabilization&#13;
objectives have been the main reasons. Despite the recent measures taken by the Government to give&#13;
the highest priority to Bank-financed projects, insufficient and unreliable counterpart transfers from the&#13;
Treasury have continued to affect project implementation. In addition, the budgetary process, which&#13;
enables the Congress to change individual allocations for specific road sections, often results in&#13;
inconsistent budgets and inefficient execution of contracts. In order to substantially reduce the impact&#13;
of such unreliable counterpart transfers on the execution of individual contracts and on project&#13;
implementation, disbursements could be made in quasi-tranches against eligible expenditures after&#13;
compliance with agreed physical and institutional implementation monitoring targets.&#13;
17.   Project Implementation Plan and Monitoring Indicators. With the exception of the recently&#13;
approved state highway management projects, the projects did not include detailed implementation&#13;
plans, appropriate indicators and targets, and computerized project management and monitoring&#13;
systems to effectively monitor project implementation, progress in fulfilling the development&#13;
objectives, and the performance of the implementing agency. As a consequence, project managers and&#13;
Bank supervision missions were unable to identify implementation delays and issues early enough to&#13;
seek timely remedial measures. The lack of detailed implementation plans, monitorable indicators and&#13;
adequate and timely project information was a major factor in the substantial delays encountered in&#13;
subproject/ investment engineering and procurement of contracts.&#13;
18.   Expenditure Planning and Programming, Network Management. The investments financed&#13;
under the highway and the feeder road projects have been justified in economic terms, and technical&#13;
solutions have been optimized at the level of each individual investment. But technical solutions and&#13;
priorities have not been optimized and justified from a network management perspective, taking into&#13;
account existing resource constraints. This shortcoming has led to substantial over-dimensioning of&#13;
individual investments, to the postponment of other essential expenditures, in particular maintenance,&#13;
and, as a consequence, to the deterioration of the overall network condition. It is therefore essential to&#13;
assess and compare alternative expenditure policies and strategies in order to optimize highway&#13;
expenditure programs and individual project investments on the basis of appropriate technical and&#13;
economic criteria and budget constraints. Experience was gained with the recent state highway projects&#13;
in carrying out regular network condition surveys, in establishing a network database, and in&#13;
optimizing expenditure strategies and programs using the Highway Design &amp; Maintenance Standards&#13;
(HDM III) Model.&#13;
19.   Maintenance by Contract. Experience with earlier highway and feeder roads projects in&#13;
Brazil and worldwide has shown that highway maintenance, when carried out by force account, is&#13;
generally ineffective. In addition to the difficulties in ensuring the necessary and timely transfers of&#13;
resources from the Treasury, government road agencies have demonstrated their inability to effectively&#13;
manage the numerous activities, the personnel and the equipment required for highway maintenance.&#13;
Since the early 1980s, DNER has contracted out the (routine) maintenance of the federal highway&#13;
network, except for highways in Amazonia; the experience has been successful in ensuring the&#13;
effective delivery of routine maintenance services at reasonable costs.  The forms of contracts,&#13;
however, still require heavy supervision from DNER. New forms of (performance) contracts, which&#13;
would pay contractors on the basis of the level of service maintained rather than of the quantities of&#13;
work performed, could be more effective and should be tested. Also, the state highway agencies, most&#13;
of which still maintain their networks by force account, should now initiate contract maintenance&#13;
programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -                                 Annex 1&#13;
20.   Design and Implementation of Institutional Components. Borrowers and executing agencies&#13;
have generally given higher priority to physical investments than to the institutional components,&#13;
which often fell short of achieving their objectives. The frequent changes in sector administrations and&#13;
management personnel have been an important factor. But the scope and timetable of the agreed&#13;
institutional components have often been over-optimistic, and have underestimated the difficulties of&#13;
the reforms. In order to be effective, the institutional components of projects need to be focused on&#13;
addressing a few essential issues. Their design and timetables should be realistic, and based on a&#13;
detailed analysis of the capacities of the organizations to implement them. If possible, disbursements&#13;
for the physical components should be linked to progress made under the institutional components.&#13;
21.   Environmental Management.   The experience with the Northwest Region Development&#13;
Program showed that highway and feeder road investments can lead to significant long-term&#13;
environmental damage by enabling destructive and disorderly colonization and economic activities, if&#13;
the necessary measures to prevent or mitigate the potential adverse impacts are not promptly&#13;
implemented. Also, road works can have more direct adverse environmental effects, such as increased&#13;
soil erosion. The ongoing Highway Management and Rehabilitation Project has been successful in&#13;
developing and disseminating Environmental Guidelines for the transport sector and for the highway&#13;
subsector, and in training federal transport sector staff.  The recent State Highway Projects are&#13;
effectively helping participating state governments to establish appropriate road environmental&#13;
management capabilities. These efforts should be continued and expanded countrywide.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RIO GRANDE DO SUL STATE HIGHWAY MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Economic Analysis of State Network Maintenance Policies and Program&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.    In order to prepare the multi-year (1996-2001) road maintenance program and define adequate&#13;
budgetary needs as well as priorities for resource allocations, the State Road Department carried out an&#13;
economic evaluation of the paved state highway network, using the latest version of the Bank's Highway&#13;
Design and Maintenance Standard Model (HDM-III and HDM Manager) associated with the Highway&#13;
Sector Expenditure Budgeting Model (EBM-HS).&#13;
2.     The HDM III is designed to make comparative cost estimates and economic evaluations of different&#13;
construction and maintenance options, including different staging strategies, either for a given road section&#13;
or an entire network. The model simulates total life cycle conditions and costs and provides economic&#13;
decision criteria for multiple road design and maintenance alternatives. The primary cost set for the life&#13;
cycle analysis includes the costs of road construction and maintenance and vehicle operating costs to which&#13;
travel time costs can be added as a special option. The concept can be simply outlined as follows:&#13;
determining costs, adding the set of costs over time and comparing the total cost streams for various&#13;
maintenance and construction alternatives. The basic data requirements are the road or network description,&#13;
construction options, maintenance standards and unit costs, vehicle characteristics and unit costs, traffic&#13;
volumes and projections, exogenous benefits and costs, analysis period and discount rates. The essential&#13;
references for understanding and running the model are contained in "The Highway Design and&#13;
Maintenance Standards Model. Model description and User's Manual" by Thawat Watanatada et al,&#13;
published for the World Bank in December 1987 by the John Hopkins University Press.&#13;
3.    The HDM Manager is a user-friendly shell environment developed over the last three years by the&#13;
World Bank for specific customized applications of HDM. For the economic evaluation of the federal&#13;
highway network, the latest version (Version 3) dated December 1994 was used in association with the full&#13;
HDM III software package. HDM Manager is designed to evaluate a set of road agency strategies,&#13;
including congestion analysis, applied to paved and unpaved roads. It stores the input data efficiently and&#13;
creates all the input files required by HDM. It then transfers, from within the shell, the data to HDM III&#13;
which in turn computes the road deterioration, the costs streams and the economic indicators used to&#13;
compare the set of strategies analyzed. Finally HDM Manager collects and presents the results in a&#13;
practical way. However, unlike the main HDM program, HDM Manager is not able to divide links into&#13;
sections and subsections, and execute only one link at a time using five alternative maintenance strategies&#13;
and up to seven vehicle types. For the calculation of vehicle operating costs, it uses the fundamental&#13;
equations derived from Brazil's experiments. Before running the HDM Model, HDM Manager requires the&#13;
user to define in succession (i) the discount rate, analysis period, initial year and currency, (ii) the road&#13;
characteristics, (iii) the vehicle fleet and (iv) the maintenance or construction strategies to be evaluated with&#13;
their respective unit costs.&#13;
4.    The EBM-HS Model is an analytical tool for optimizing multi-year programs of expenditures&#13;
under multiple budgetary constraints. Particularly useful when used in conjunction with the HDM program,&#13;
EBM-HS reads the project data generated by HDM III (as previously stored in an ASCII text file) and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -                                 Annex 2&#13;
finds the optimal maintenance policy (i.e., the policy that maximizes the net benefits) to be implemented,&#13;
under budgetary constraints. It is capable of handling up to 100 projects (i.e. maintenance, upgrading,&#13;
construction, widening, etc...) with 16 mutually exclusive alternatives. Each project-alternative having&#13;
annual values of economic costs and benefits as well as annual amounts of capital and recurrent resources&#13;
needed to implement the alternative, EBM-HS program, when given the optimization command, examines&#13;
the resources consumed and the Net Present Value (NPV) produced from the implementation of each&#13;
project alternative. With the constraint that it must choose only one alternative for each project, the&#13;
program selects the group of alternatives that produces the optimal total NPV for all projects within the&#13;
budget constraint limits which have been defined.&#13;
B. Methodology of Economic Evaluation&#13;
5.    The economic evaluation involved the following step-by-step procedure:&#13;
(i) update the road network inventory, according to a methodology designed to provide the minimum&#13;
but necessary amount of information on traffic, pavement condition and environmental parameters;&#13;
(ii) compile all the data collected from the inventory into a data base that enables the data to be sorted&#13;
and analyzed them in the most efficient manner;&#13;
(iii) identify and estimate the unit costs of the current and most effective maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation (or upgrading) techniques compatible with current experience and material&#13;
resources;&#13;
(iv) analyze and determine the most probable budget constraint scenarios which the State Road&#13;
Department will experience during the next five years or so;&#13;
(v) on the basis of the information obtained from the inventory, design a matrix which would&#13;
disaggregate the road network into homogeneous groups of roads or links suitable for evaluation,&#13;
and formulate maintenance policy altematives for each one of these groups (or cells of the matrix);&#13;
(vi) calibrate the HDM  model to reflect modem  vehicle technology and specific pavement&#13;
deterioration pattems observed in the region; and&#13;
(vii) run the HDM Manager and EBM models to arrive at the optimum set of maintenance strategies&#13;
consistent with budget constraints, and the listing of priorities with corresponding expenditures for&#13;
the 1996-2001 period.&#13;
C. Basic Parameters and Assumptions used in the Analysis&#13;
6.    The basic parameters and assumptions used to run the HDM and EBM models are:&#13;
(a) Network conditions and characteristics, including traffic volumes, composition and growth;&#13;
(b)  Vehicle characteristics and operating unit costs;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33 -                                  Annex 2&#13;
(c) Typical construction, overlay and maintenance techniques with their respective unit costs;&#13;
The values used for these parameters are given below. In addition, the following assumptions were made:&#13;
Discount rate = 12%; Analysis Period = 20 years; Traffic Growth = 3 % per year; Year 1 of&#13;
implementation = 1997; Generated Traffic = 0; Nature of benefits = reduced vehicle operating costs, time&#13;
savings of road users, and reduction in maintenance costs.&#13;
(a) Network Inventory&#13;
7.    The network inventory was made using methodologies for collecting information designed to be&#13;
consistent with the minimum requirements of the economic model to be used (HDM Manager), and also to&#13;
achieve speed at reasonable cost. The inventory covered both the paved and unpaved network and&#13;
comprised the following tasks:&#13;
(a) a definition (identification name, length, age of construction...) of individual homogeneous&#13;
segments forming the state network, based on archives available in the DAER;&#13;
(b) the quantification of the geometrical, structural and environmental parameters characterizing each&#13;
homogeneous segment, i.e., width of pavement and shoulders, pavement surface type, rainfall,&#13;
altitude and topography;&#13;
(c) visual assessment, on a continuous basis, of surface defects enabling the extent (%) of potholes and&#13;
cracking to be determiined for each homogeneous link;&#13;
(d) characterization of the pavement structure for each homogeneous link, including the definition of&#13;
the thickness and geotechnical nature of the materials forming that structure, as well as subgrade&#13;
California Bearing Ratio (CBR) values; this information being obtained either from existing files&#13;
or from a few pits dug in the pavements;&#13;
(e) continuous roughness measurements using calibrated response-type equipment (Mays meter);&#13;
(f) deflection and rut depth measurements at 50 m. intervals over the whole network, thus&#13;
enabling each uniform segment to be associated with representative values of deflection and rut&#13;
depth,&#13;
(g) and finally traffic counts, on each uniform section, of the network; the counts involving the&#13;
assessment of both the volumes and the distribution of vehicles by class; (annual traffic growth&#13;
projection figures being obtained from past records and/or predicted growth of other economic&#13;
indicators);&#13;
8.    The traffic data used were those of 1994; visual surveys and deflection measurements were made&#13;
in 1996, while the roughness measurements were carried out during the third quarter of 1995 (Charts 1, 2).&#13;
9.    Following the collection of data, all the informnation was compiled into a computerized data bank&#13;
designed to enable easy processing and consistency. The worksheets uniformly contained about 30 columns&#13;
representing the road and traffic conditions parameters required by HDM Manager, and as many rows as&#13;
individual road segments within the network. By and large, the average length of each individual section&#13;
varied from 10 km to 40 km. Once the information was entered in the data bank, it was analyzed, checked&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

for consistency, sorted out and rearranged in larger homogeneous groups of roads having similar surface,&#13;
structural, traffic and environmental characteristics.&#13;
(b) Vehicle Characteristics and Operating Costs&#13;
10.      The vehicle characteristics, utilization and costs data necessary for estimating vehicle operating&#13;
costs are presented in Table 1 hereafter. Costs are given in economic terms, financial costs being about 1.7&#13;
times economic costs, on average.&#13;

(economic costs are about 85% of financial costs). More generally, the following equations reflect the&#13;
average financial unit costs of asphalt concrete overlays, reconstruction and paving as a function of overlay&#13;
thickness (h,cm), and equivalent (granular) thickness (t,cm) of reconstructed or new pavement:&#13;
Cost of AC overlay/km    in US$      =        (7160*h) + 11,000&#13;
Cost of reconstructlkm   in US$      =        (474.4*t) - 8292&#13;
Cost of paving/km        in US$      =        2[(4478*t) + 16,0001 ('&#13;
Cost of paving/km        in US$      =        2[(4454*t) + 34,000] (2)&#13;
(') when wearing course is surface treatment, and (2) when it is 5cm of asphalt concrete.&#13;
The above costs include not only pavement execution but also drainage, pavement marking, and&#13;
environmental improvements. In the case of overlays, these additional costs represent between 15% and&#13;
30% of total costs. In the case of upgrading and paving which usually involve geometrical improvement&#13;
(earthworks) and substantial drainage and bridge rehabilitation, additional costs vary between 1/3 and 2/3&#13;
of total cost (on average one-half).&#13;
(d)    Budget Constraints&#13;
12.   The levels of budget constraints likely to be experienced during the next five years were assessed&#13;
on the basis of past allocations. Between 1991 and 1995 state transfers to DAER for current and capital&#13;
expenditures varied between US$107 million and US$215 million, of which 50% to 85% was invested in&#13;
the network. For the economic analysis five budget constraint scenarios were considered, varying between&#13;
a no-budget constraint hypothesis and a minimum of US$10 million per year. The actual budget value&#13;
taken into account for defining the 1997-2001 road rehabilitation program corresponds to US$25 million&#13;
each year during the five-year implementation period. These resources apply essentially to works, and do&#13;
not include personnel or administration costs of DAER, which on average will represent about 20% of total&#13;
expenditures. The following budget constraint scenarios were tested during the analysis:&#13;
Scenario A:   Unconstrained budget&#13;
Scenario B:   US$ 25 million each year, during 5 years&#13;
Scenario C:   US$ 20 million each year, during 5 years&#13;
Scenario D:   US$ 15 million each year, during 5 years&#13;
Scenario E:   US$ 10 million each year, during 5 years&#13;
Starting in year 6, the budget was left unconstrained in order to determine the level of expenditures&#13;
needed in the future. In addition, resource allocations for routine maintenance were left unconstrained.&#13;
(e)    Design of Analytical Matrices&#13;
13.   Prior to conducting the economic evaluation, two matrices were designed in order to disaggregate&#13;
the road network according to surface type. One matrix, the larger one, concerned the paved network and&#13;
included all pavements with asphalt concrete wearing courses on the one hand and on the other, all&#13;
pavements with surface treatments (Chart 3). The second matrix was designed to represent the unpaved&#13;
network.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -                                  Annex 2&#13;
14.   In addition to surface type, the following parameters were considered in designing the matrices:&#13;
(a)    maintenance condition of the paved network, including 4 rating categories: good, fair, critical,&#13;
and poor as a function of roughness, the thresholds used being respectively IRI &lt; 2.5, 2.5&lt; IRI &lt;&#13;
3.5, 3.5 &lt; IRI &lt; 4.5, and IRI &gt;4.5.&#13;
(b)    structural strength, including strong pavements with deflection less than 0.6 mm (or modified&#13;
structural number above 3.5), and weak pavements having mean deflection higher than 0.6 mm (or&#13;
modified structural number below 3.5);&#13;
(c)    traffic level, distinguishing seven classes for the paved network, namely : &lt; 500, 500-1,000,&#13;
1,000-2,000, 2000-3000, 3,000-4,000, 4,000-7,000 and &gt; 7,000 vehicles/day ; and 4 classes for&#13;
the unpaved network, i.e., &lt;250, 250-500, 500-1,000, &gt; 1,000.&#13;
15.    This breakdown gave rise to the identification of homogeneous groups of roads or links, suitable&#13;
for evaluation. By definition, each group, of a given total or accumulated length, normally falls within one&#13;
cell of the matrices as having similar characteristics and is to be subjected to a specific set of maintenance&#13;
policy alternatives, as described below. The matrix for paved roads comprised 56 cells, and the matrix for&#13;
the unpaved network comprised 4 cells, reflecting only the 4 traffic volume categories.&#13;
D. Program Evaluation&#13;
16.   The economic evaluation itself comprised six successive steps: (i) the calibration of the HDM&#13;
model; (ii) the formulation of maintenance policy alternatives for each cell of the matrix; (iii) the HDM&#13;
Manager runs at the link group (or cell) level, which allows for comparisons of the retums to be expected&#13;
from each maintenance strategy alternative; (iv) the EBM runs which optimize, at the network level, the set&#13;
of strategies analyzed by HDM Manager, taking into account various budget constraint scenarios; (v) the&#13;
selection of the set of strategies and priorities which are consistent with the predicted budget constraint&#13;
level; and (vi) a sensitivity and risk analysis for the selected strategy, to assess the impact of cost increases&#13;
and/or benefit decreases, as well as delay in implementation, upon the economic retums.&#13;
17.    Calibration of the VOC submodel. The vehicle operating cost submodel was calibrated by&#13;
updating vehicle costs and characteristics and by adjusting the maintenance parts equations of the HDM III&#13;
model to reflect modern vehicle technology. The recent HDM-4 international study indicates that the&#13;
maintenance parts equations of HDM-III over-estimates parts consumption for modem vehicles and there is&#13;
an inconsistency in the parts consumption rate (sensitivity of parts consumption to roughness) for&#13;
passenger cars that is significantly higher than for other vehicles and that this was probably due to the&#13;
types of vehicles used in the HDM-III study. Therefore, following the guidelines of the HDM-4 study, and&#13;
apart from discarding variation in costs for roughness level lower than 3 IRI, the maintenance parts&#13;
consumption for "new technology" vehicles was taken to be 75 per cent of the "old technology" vehicles&#13;
and the parts consumption rate for passenger cars was adjusted to be the same as for trucks. Thus, in the&#13;
table of optional parameters for the vehicle fleet data contained in HDM Manager, the default values of&#13;
32.49, 1.49, 8.61, and 13.94 used for the constant coefficient CPO in the exponential relationship between&#13;
spare parts consumption and roughness which applied respectively to light vehicles, light trucks, heavy&#13;
trucks and articulated trucks were replaced by 24.37, 1.128, 6.46, and 10.46. Similarly, for cars and&#13;
utilities the roughness coefficient CPq in the exponential relationship between spare part consumption and&#13;
roughness was reduced from 13.7 to a value of 9. The net impact of these changes is a 59% reduction in&#13;
roughness effect for light vehicles and about 42-43% for trucks. Other calibration adjustments made&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -                                   Annex 2&#13;
referred essentially to the energy-efficiency factor and the hourly utilization ratios: the energy-efficiency&#13;
factor which directly affects the prediction of fuel consumption was adjusted by replacing the default value&#13;
of 1 (which applied to vehicles employed during the Brazil studies) by 0.8 in order to incorporate modem&#13;
and more fuel-efficient vehicles makes and models. The hourly utilization ratios which affect the prediction&#13;
of depreciation and interest were adjusted by replacing the default values of 0.60, 0.80, 0.75, 0.85&#13;
respectively used for cars, utilities, buses, and trucks, by 0.20, 0.30, 0.40, and 0.50. Finally, vehicle and&#13;
maintenance labor costs, and service life and hours driven per year were updated as shown in Table 1.&#13;
18.    Calibration of the Road Deterioration Submodel.  The road deterioration submodel was&#13;
calibrated by introducing equivalent standard axle factors for heavy vehicles that take into account the&#13;
overloading observed or expected to occur on the network. Also, for the assessment of pavement residual&#13;
strength and the prediction of roughness and other surface defects, deflection values effectively measured&#13;
on the network were given precedence over structural numbers estimated from theoretical material strength&#13;
coefficients. Considering the low values of deflection measured (about 85% less than 0.75 mm), this&#13;
approach resulted in modified sructural numbers greater than what would have been otherwise calculated,&#13;
and consequently to somewhat slower deterioration patterns. Finally, the roughness progression model was&#13;
adjusted by adopting an environment coefficient of 1.3 to take into account the specificities of regional&#13;
climatic conditions (subtropical, non-freezing).&#13;
19.    Formulation of Maintenance Alternatives. Strategies can be either scheduled in time or&#13;
responsive to a certain threshold of surface condition. For paved roads in good condition and low traffic&#13;
which do not need periodic maintenance actions in the near future, maintenance policies were scheduled to&#13;
occur in years 5, 7, 9, and 11. For medium to high traffic, the policies for these roads were triggered&#13;
sooner, in years 1, 3, 5, and 7. For paved roads in fair, critical or poor condition, and whatever the traffic,&#13;
periodic maintenance actions can be expected to be needed immediately or in the near future, and therefore&#13;
the strategies were scheduled to occur immediately (year 1 of the project). They were also allowed to be&#13;
slightly postponed to the third, fifth, or seventh year of the project in order to test the effect of&#13;
postponement on the economic returns. For unpaved roads, policies are either scheduled (for example, in&#13;
terms of time intervals between grading, or number of grading per year), or responsive (for example,&#13;
regraveling when gravel thickness falls below 5 cm). Upgrading and paving operations are generally&#13;
scheduled to take place either immediately or postponed to a few years later.&#13;
20.    For the paved network, the base strategy (alternative 1) included routine maintenance with 100%&#13;
patching of potholes and reconstruction when roughness reaches a very high level, i.e., 11 IRI. The other&#13;
four maintenance options to which each cell or group of homogeneous roads were subjected were generally&#13;
the following, depending on traffic level and the condition of the pavement:&#13;
(a) for pavements in good condition, resurfacing operations were tested, using slurry seals or thin to&#13;
medium asphalt concrete overlays, 4 and 5 cm thick;&#13;
(b) for pavements in fair or critical condition, medium to thick overlays were tested, with thicknesses&#13;
ranging between 4 and 8 cm;&#13;
(c) for pavements in poor condition, thick asphalt concrete overlays ranging from 5 cm to 10 cm in&#13;
thickness were analyzed, including reconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -                                    Annex 2&#13;
In all cases, future policies included routine maintenance and a 5 cm thick asphalt concrete overlay when&#13;
roughness reaches a value of 4 IRI.&#13;
21.    For the unpaved network and considering the relatively high level of traffic generally observed&#13;
(more than 100 vehicles per day), the base strategy consisted in carrying out routine maintenance and one&#13;
grading every 60 days. The other alternatives included grading every month with regraveling when residual&#13;
gravel thickness falls below 5 cm, and paving at different unit costs ranging between US$100,000 and&#13;
US$400,000/Ian.&#13;

24.    The nearest-to-optimum and more practical          Annual Expenditure (1997-2001) USSM&#13;
strategy consists in investing about US$25 million&#13;
per year over the next 5 years of implementation of  Fig 6 % in Poor Condition in 2001 vs Annual&#13;
the project. This strategy which is consistent with                Expenditure&#13;
DAER's  expected  resource  availability  was         o50&#13;
therefore retained to design the project. The present&#13;

savings discounted at 12%  per year is about        X  2&#13;

US$720 million. The project's Net Present Value&#13;
(NPV) is estimated at about US$615 million, its        10&#13;
Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR) at 98%            02&#13;
and its Benefit/Cost ratio (B/C) at 6.7 (Fig. 1-3).          0    10    15    20    25&#13;

about 25% to nearly 50% by the year 2001. All the    -         in 1997-2001&#13;
backlog will have been made up. Moreover, the    c 40&#13;
structural strength of the network will be increased    _&amp;&#13;
by about 50%  (the average modified structural     3&#13;
number being raised from 2.8 to 4.6, as a result of    E 20&#13;
overlay operations), thus extending the residual life  Z   :o&#13;
of the network by at least 10 years. It is also    &gt; 0&#13;
interesting to note that should the network be left  la  10      15      20      25&#13;
unattended over the next five years (except for            n&#13;
routine maintenance), the proportion of roads in&#13;
poor condition would increase dramatically to about&#13;
50% in 2001, requiring by then annual expenditures   Fig 9 Evolution of % in Poor conadition&#13;
of an amount equal to two-fold the amount resulting    .0       1996-2001&#13;
from implementing the project (Fig. 7). At the same    A  8&#13;
time, road users would see their cost increase by 10  6&#13;
to 20% over the same period.&#13;
26.   Sensitivity analyses show that an increase -  2&#13;
8&#13;
of 25% in investment costs would reduce NPV of    X.&#13;
the project from US$615 million to US$592 million        9     7    8    9 20   20&#13;

25% reduction in road user benefits (or traffic&#13;
volume) would cause NPV to drop to US$438           Fig 10 Evolution of % in Good Condition&#13;
million (about 28%) and IERR  to  77%. A         ,             1996-2001&#13;
simultaneous 25%  increase in cost and 25%      v5&#13;

27.   The  most  likely  risk  in  project&#13;
implementation is the delay that may occur mainly as a result of untimely release of counterpart funds. The&#13;
analyses indicated that if execution of the project takes 6 to 8 years to complete instead of the anticipated 5&#13;
years as suggested by historical evidence from highway projects in Brazil, the project's NPV would be&#13;
reduced by no more than 10%. Assuming an extreme case of implementation period extending over 12 to&#13;
13 years would cause NPV to be reduced from US$615 million to US$434 million, i.e., by about 30%,&#13;
with still a very high rate of return.&#13;
28.   The following table summarizes the estimates of project benefits and costs, in economic and&#13;
financial terms.&#13;

Note: Benefits are reductions in vehicle operating costs (about 90%) and passenger time savings (about 10%)&#13;
29.   The analyses performed also helped determine the most cost-effective maintenance and overlay&#13;
solutions to be applied to the paved network, considering the resources to be allocated. These technical&#13;
solutions which depend on traffic level and pavement condition have been incorporated into a Catalog of&#13;
Structures as shown in Chart 4. The catalog will be included in the Operational Manual of the project and&#13;
will be used to govern the design of resurfacing, overlay or reconstruction operations to be implemented&#13;
under the project. In addition to recommending optimum overlay solutions, the HDM/EBM model analyses&#13;
also indicated the order of priority in which the rehabilitation works should be executed. The year-to-year&#13;
programming of execution is shown in the Cost and Financing table.&#13;
30.   Although the Bank contribution to the project is intended to be used solely for the rehabilitation of&#13;
the paved network, the maintenance of the unpaved network (using local funds) will not be overlooked.&#13;
The HDM analyses indicated that for traffic levels of between 100 and 300 vehicles per day, grading at&#13;
intervals of 60 days including periodic regraveling is an acceptable maintenance policy.  The&#13;
implementation of that strategy will help reduce considerably road user costs on that network, from a&#13;
current value of about US$450 million per year to US$250 million.&#13;
31.   Finally, and considering the unit costs of paving in the state (which presently vary between about&#13;
US$160,000 and US$300,000 per kIn), the analyses indicated that the traffic thresholds that justify paving&#13;
(i.e., yielding a minimum rate of return of 12%), lie between 500 and 600 vehicles per day. More generally,&#13;
the following equation, derived from the analyses, gives, as a function of paving costs, the minimum daily&#13;
traffic volume that will ensure a zero NPV or an IERR of 12% for the investment:&#13;
Minimum ADT = (1.6*C) + 150&#13;
where C is the unit cost in US$ thousands per km of upgrading and paving.&#13;
F. Economic Analysis of First-Year Program&#13;
32.   The first-year rehabilitation program consists of the highest priority road sections identified by the&#13;
HDM/EBM analysis as those in need of urgent attention, and for which the investments to be made yield&#13;
the highest economic return (generally with ratios of NPV/Initial Capital Cost higher than 3 and NPV/km&#13;
greater than US$300,000). The total length of roads to be rehabilitated during the first year of the project&#13;
amounts to about 463 km, at a total estimated cost of US$25 million. Altogether, there are 19 sections&#13;
comprising the program, with individual lengths generally between 12 and 45 km. The majority of these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -                                                 Annex 2&#13;
roads are located in the north and north-east part of the state, and presently carry high volumes of traffic&#13;
ranging from 2,000 to 5,000 vehicles/day. They also exhibit high deflection, above 0.6 mm, and present&#13;
high roughness values, usually between 3.5 and 5 IRI. The rehabilitation works will consist generally in&#13;
asphalt concrete overlays with thickness varying between 4 and 8 cm. The increase in structural strength&#13;
provided by the overlays will help the pavements to withstand traffic loading over the next 10 years or so,&#13;
by which time a new overlay will need to be applied.&#13;
33.      The economic analysis of the first-year program  indicated that the NPV  of the investments is in the&#13;
order of US$336 million, with IERRs in the range of 50% to 150% (averaging 104%). An increase in&#13;
investment cost of 25% or a decrease in benefits of the same proportion will marginally affect the IERR,&#13;
causing it to drop to an average value of 70%. In Table 4 are listed the name of these road sections&#13;
together with their average characteristics, overlay thickness required and total estimated costs, as well as&#13;
the values obtained for the economic indicators (NPV and IERR).&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RIO GRANDE DO SUL STATE HIGHWAY MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Institutional Capacity, Technical Assistance and Training&#13;
A. Institutional Capacity Analysis&#13;
1.    To minimize project risks, an institutional capacity assessment was made during project&#13;
preparation, with special attention given to the institutional weaknesses existing within the State Road&#13;
Department. The following shortcomings were identified.&#13;
2.    The project being the first Bank-financed highway project to be executed by the DAER, the&#13;
agency is not yet fully familiar with Bank's requirements and procedures regarding procurement,&#13;
disbursement, financial reporting and auditing systems. There is therefore a need to strengthen the&#13;
capacity of the agency for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control mechanisms and&#13;
setting up a project management system capable of providing accurate and timely information regarding&#13;
project resources and expenditures, inputs and outcomes based upon appropriate accounting, auditing&#13;
and monitoring mechanisms.&#13;
3.    Although the project design was derived, with Bank's assistance, from a comprehensive HDM&#13;
economic evaluation which helped define a rational multi-year program of road rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance with appropriate strategies and priorities based on a thorough network condition survey,&#13;
further enhancement of the agency's skills in using the economic model to improve, adjust, and update&#13;
the overall planning and programming of road activities in the future is needed.&#13;
4.    DAER has traditionally used force-account to cope with the routine maintenance of the road&#13;
network but has now decided to shift its policy towards more cost-effective maintenance execution&#13;
involving a greater participation of the private sector. To help DAER management achieve this&#13;
objective and meet the targets set out for maintenance by contract (measuring performance not by&#13;
quantity of works carried out but by level of services provided to the road users) the proficiency of the&#13;
agency in the design, procurement and supervision of contracted routine maintenance needs to be&#13;
increased.&#13;
5.    The ambitious scope of the State's road concession program will exert challenging demands on&#13;
the Road Department once concession contracts are underway.  The current capacity of the&#13;
organization to evaluate, supervise, monitor that program  is inadequate.  Further institutional&#13;
strengthening in this area is thus required.&#13;
6.    Although the rehabilitation works to be financed under this project are unlikely to have any&#13;
negative and substantial environmental impacts, the risks involved in the other upgrading and paving&#13;
programs of the State must not be overlooked. An adequate environmental mitigation, monitoring and&#13;
management plan must be established and for that, greater support to DAER environmental assessment&#13;
capacity needs to be provided.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -                                 Annex 3&#13;
7.    The results of the above-mentioned diagnosis served as a foundation to design the objectives&#13;
and tasks of the technical assistance needed to fill the institutional capacity gaps, described above.&#13;
B. Technical Assistance&#13;
8.    Consistent with the institutional environment assessment, technical assistance will be provided&#13;
under the project to strengthen the capacity of the State Road Department, and in particular the Project&#13;
Management Unit, in the following areas:&#13;
*  general program and project management&#13;
*  planning and programming supported by an adequate pavement management system&#13;
&#149;  development of road concession monitoring system&#13;
*  routine maintenance by contract&#13;
*  assessment and mitigation of environmental impact of roadworks.&#13;
9.    The assistance will be provided through the contracting of a consulting firm whose Terms of&#13;
Reference include, inter-alia, the following tasks and responsibilities:&#13;
(a) Develop and implement a computerized information system to adequately monitor the&#13;
implementation performance of the program, including assisting the road agency in: (a) the&#13;
selection, procurement and supervision of consultancy services needed for the final engineering&#13;
designs and supervision of the subproject roads included in the programs; (b) the contracting&#13;
and technical auditing of the firms that will carry out the rehabilitation works; (c) the&#13;
monitoring of project performance targets (physical, financial, institutional), as agreed between&#13;
the Bank and the Borrower, and the identification of necessary adjustments in project design or&#13;
implementation.&#13;
(b) Develop and implement suitable accounting, financial and technical reporting and auditing&#13;
systems capable of providing periodically accurate information regarding project resources and&#13;
expenditures, progress and outcomes, all in accordance with Bank's Guidelines and in&#13;
compliance with the clauses and covenants stipulated in the loan agreement.&#13;
(c) Review and upgrade the technical manual and standard specifications currently used in the&#13;
State for roadworks, incorporating, in particular, appropriate environmental mitigation&#13;
measures or guidelines.&#13;
(d) Develop and implement a coherent road network management system including the&#13;
subnetworks to be rehabilitated, maintained under DAER authorities or concessioned to the&#13;
private sector.&#13;
(e) Assist in the elaboration of updated multi-year road investment and maintenance programs&#13;
based on renewed network condition and traffic surveys, and supported by HDM/EBM&#13;
economic evaluation.&#13;
(f) Assist in the design, procurement, implementation and monitoring of the program of routine&#13;
maintenance by contract, including a study on secured road maintenance financing&#13;
mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -                                  Annex 3&#13;
(g) Assist and give support to the DAER Environmental Unit, including the review and/or&#13;
elaboration of norms, specifications and performance monitoring indicators related to the&#13;
environment and the promotion of studies regarding current or desirable future legislation.&#13;
(h) Prepare a comprehensive training program in all the areas in which skills need to be enhanced&#13;
and contribute to on-the-job training in its specialized field of expertise, as spelled out in&#13;
section C below.&#13;
(i) Develop and implement a computerized system for the management and monitoring of the&#13;
Road Concession Program, including the review of the concessionaires' work-program&#13;
proposals, assistance in the supervision and quality control of the works executed,&#13;
contributions to eventual studies of adjustments of toll rates, and the monitoring of the&#13;
operation of the concession complemented by adequately designed user satisfaction surveys.&#13;
C. Training Program&#13;
10.   Apart from other specific training activities, yet to be defined by the TA Consultant, and which&#13;
may involve participation of DAER staff to seminars and coursed provided abroad or locally, on-the-&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RIO GRANDE DO SUL STATE HIGHWAY MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Project Supervision and Monitoring Plan&#13;
1.    The State's Road Department (DAER), as part of the action program to strengthen contract&#13;
management and program monitoring, would establish an appropriate computerized system to monitor&#13;
the implementation of the project, including producing adequate information to report to DAER&#13;
management, the Government, and to the Bank, in accordance with the specifications included in the&#13;
POM. DAER would forward quarterly progress reports to the Bank, not later than one month after the&#13;
end of the quarter.&#13;
2.    The Bank, as part of its project supervision responsibilities, would review and comment on the&#13;
following documents: (a) state annual road programs (SRPs) and budgets; (b) subprojects applications and&#13;
related documentation; (c) annual procurement and execution programs; (d) procurement documentation&#13;
for all ICB and the first two NCB contracts for civil works; (e) terms of reference, invitation letters,&#13;
short-lists and draft contract for consultant services; and (f) the quarterly progress reports. The Bank&#13;
would approve all subprojects for financing under the loan on the basis of subproject applications&#13;
prepared in the agreed format included in the POM.&#13;
3.    The Bank would monitor project implementation against the PIP, including the sets of actions and&#13;
timetable, procurement, physical and financial execution targets, and development impact (Annex 5,&#13;
Table 2). A mid-term, detailed review of the implementation of the project would be carried out by the&#13;
end of 1999 or when 50% of the loan amount has been disbursed, whichever comes sooner. The review&#13;
would cover all the agreed actions, targets dates, and execution targets included in the PIP and the status&#13;
of compliance with all covenants of the Loan Agreement. Particular importance will be given to: (a) the&#13;
state governments' commitment to provide adequate funds for maintenance and rehabilitation, including&#13;
counterpart funds for the project; and (b) DAER's performance under the agreed institutional development&#13;
component. The Bank will have the right to exercise appropriate remedies, including suspension of&#13;
disbursements and termination of the loan, if the state government and/or DAER default under the&#13;
funding condition and/or DAER's performance is not satisfactory.&#13;
4.    The Bank will supervise and monitor the implementation of the project in accordance with the&#13;
Plan presented in this Annex. The estimates of Bank supervision inputs into key activities, which are&#13;
shown in the table of this annex.&#13;

            Brazil - Rio Grande Do Sul State Highway
            Management Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main objective of the Rio Grande Do
            Sul State Highway Management Project is to improve state
            highway network serviceability with a view to reducing road
            transport costs, through: (1) more efficient allocation and
            use; (2) increasing private participation in road
            management; (3) improving the capacity of the state
            department that manages roads (DAER); and (4) rehabilitating
            selected sections and maintaining the state's entire
            paved highway network. The project's components are:
            (1) policy and institutional development, including
            technical assistance, equipment, software, and staff
            training to (a) prepare and monitor efficient state road
            expenditure and funding programs; (b) supervise and monitor
            implementing the state's highway concession program and
            transferring maintenance activities to private contractors;
            and (c) restructure the DAER's operations according to
            policy changes satisfying stated criteria, downsizing
            operational divisions and strengthening technical,
            environmental, management and supervision capabilities, and
            establishing clear goals and accountability; and (2)
            rehabilitation, including resurfacing, and routine
            maintenance of the state's roads, and related studies,
            engineering designs, and works supervision.
