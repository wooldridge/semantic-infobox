1. THE ECONOMY&#13;
1.1   Jamaica, a small island economy in the Caribbean, has a total area of 11,000 km 2&#13;
and a population estimated at 2.5 million (1994 GNP per capita is US$1,420). About&#13;
45% of the land is used for agriculture. About 55% of the population, which increased by&#13;
0.9 percent in 1993, lives in urban areas. The country is well endowed with natural&#13;
resources, has a relatively well educated and skilled labor force, enjoys proximity to North&#13;
American markets, and has a developed financial system. It is wholly reliant on imported&#13;
oil for commercial energy consumption.&#13;
1.2   The economy is vulnerable to external factors such as foreign demand for&#13;
bauxite/alumina and tourism, its key exports, and the price of oil. The 1994 Country&#13;
Economic Memorandum' (CEM) presents a vision of how the economy can make the&#13;
transition from stabilization to growth and reduce poverty through economic&#13;
development. The following sections summarize the CEM findings.&#13;
A. Recent Economic Developments&#13;
1.3    After rapid development in the 60s, with growth rates on the order of 5%, fueled&#13;
by foreign investment in mining and tourism, as well as favorable terms of trade, the&#13;
economy declined and stagnated in the 70s and 80s. Many of the problems associated&#13;
with this situation can be traced to external shocks, excessive government intervention,&#13;
import-substitution policies and pervasive administrative controls. Expansion of the public&#13;
sector crowded out the private sector and increased the external debt which doubled&#13;
between 1980 and 1985, reaching US$4 billion.&#13;
1.4   In the second half of the 80s, economic policies were revised, the public sector&#13;
deficit was reduced, the import tariff system was restructured, many subsidies were&#13;
eliminated and some trade restrictions were lifted. From 1987 to 1993 GDP grew at an&#13;
average rate of 3%; however, growth has been below 2% in 1993 and 1994.&#13;
1.5   At present, Jamaica has a long-awaited breathing space in which to sustain and&#13;
complete the structural reforms necessary to restore growth. For the first time in almost a&#13;
decade, the country does not face a major financial crisis, macroeconomic imbalance, or&#13;
negative external shock.&#13;
B. CEM Policy Recommendations&#13;
1.6   The CEM emphasizes the following elements for achieving accelerated and&#13;
sustainable growth:&#13;
'Jamaica- A strategy for growth and poverty reduction. Country Economic Memorandum. Report No. 1 2702-JM,&#13;
April 12, 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
*  Government should focus its efforts on tasks that the private sector cannot&#13;
perform adequately and should withdraw from those which can better be&#13;
managed by private enterprise;&#13;
*  Overall economic policy should seek to assure macroeconomic stability in&#13;
order to attract investors;&#13;
*  Public expenditures should be targeted towards infrastructure, environmental&#13;
protection and human resource development;&#13;
*  Efforts to reduce crime and protect property should be increased in order for&#13;
market forces, and policies that work through them, to have their desired&#13;
effects; and&#13;
*  Economic goals should be achieved through the regulatory and incentive&#13;
structures rather than through budget and spending processes.&#13;
C. Government Economic Policy&#13;
1.7   Since 1989, the Government has embarked on an accelerated program of&#13;
economic reform involving liberalization, deregulation and privatization. These are aimed&#13;
at enhancing economic performance and improving social welfare over the medium term.&#13;
As articulated in its current Medium Term Reform Program (1992/93-1995/96) these&#13;
reforms continued to focus on reducing the role of the public sector in commercially-&#13;
oriented and industrial activities while creating a competitive and facilitative environment&#13;
to stimulate private investment and export. Under this program, real GDP growth is&#13;
targeted to improve to 3.5 percent by the mid-1990s.&#13;
1.8   Government policy has been largely successful in applying these policies:&#13;
*  On the macroeconomic front, the public sector continues to generate surpluses&#13;
in recent years;&#13;
*  Average inflation was reduced from 77.3 per cent in 1992 to about 25% in&#13;
1993-94;&#13;
*  The currency has traded freely in the parallel market and foreign exchange&#13;
deposits have grown from zero to over $500 million,&#13;
*  Financial sector policy has improved greatly in the past five years by opening&#13;
more to international markets, evening out the regulatory framework for&#13;
different categories of financial institutions, and lessening the requirement to&#13;
finance public debt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
*  The Jamaican Stock Exchange, although very small, grew rapidly in the early&#13;
1990s (it was the fastest growing market in the world in 1992); and&#13;
*  Privatization has proceeded successfully, with Bank support through the&#13;
Private Sector Development Adjustment Loan; over 50 entities have been&#13;
divested and at least an equal number are slated for privatization.&#13;
1.9   GOJ's economic objectives consist of supporting the stabilization program and&#13;
seeking sustained improvements in the public finances. GOJ is committed to continue&#13;
reducing the size and scope of the public sector and to stimulate efficient investment and&#13;
growth in the private sector. The GOJ has circulated for comment an Industrial Strategy&#13;
which outlines the tactics for growth. A number of externally-assisted reforms are also&#13;
taking place, such as the Bank-supported Tax Administration Reform Project (loan&#13;
amount US$13.2 million) which addresses the need to broaden the tax base, improve tax&#13;
collection and eliminate distortions. These efforts will serve to enhance recently&#13;
implemented tariff and customs reforms.&#13;
D. Bank Lending Strategy&#13;
1.10  The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), attached to the Reform of&#13;
Secondary Education Project (March 1993), updates the development agenda of GOJ.&#13;
The Bank Group's current assistance strategy includes the Private Sector Development&#13;
Adjustment Loan approved on June 15, 1993, designed to support trade reforms, the&#13;
privatization program, and other measures to increase the incentives for private&#13;
investment. A loan for the reform of secondary education in Jamaica was approved on&#13;
March 25, 1993, and a loan for Private Investment and Export Development was&#13;
approved on March 24, 1994. Future Bank lending would consist largely of investment&#13;
loan financing, tax administration reform, public sector modernization, transport, and&#13;
other infrastructure development, social investments, and private sector development.&#13;

2. THE ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
A. Background&#13;
2.1   Jamaica's sources of indigenous energy are limited, comprised of a relatively small&#13;
hydropower potential, bagasse and peat. The country therefore relies on imports, mainly&#13;
oil, to meet its energy needs. Hydropower potential in the country amounts to about 114&#13;
MW, of which 24 MW have been developed to date (about 4% of total installed&#13;
generation capacity). At present there are eight hydroelectric power plants which range in&#13;
capacity from 0.2 MW to 6 MW. Hydropower potential which may be economically&#13;
developed during the next 15-20 years is estimated at about 90 MW. Peat is the only&#13;
indigenous fuel available in Jamaica in relatively significant quantities; however, the&#13;
economic viability of peat development has not been proven and its adverse environmental&#13;
implications have deterred its use. Additional energy resources (other than fuelwood&#13;
which is used to produce charcoal) include substantial amounts of bagasse which is used&#13;
by the sugar industry as fuel for industrial steam and electricity generation. GOJ has tried&#13;
unsuccessfully to broaden and develop the country's indigenous sources of energy through&#13;
on-shore and off-shore drilling. Solar energy promises some economic potential in the&#13;
form of domestic water heating and crop drying. Barring significant discoveries of oil and&#13;
gas, or unforeseen technological breakthroughs, the country will continue to rely on&#13;
imported oil to meet most of its energy requirements.&#13;
B. Institutions and Sector Organization&#13;
2.2   The Ministry of Public Utilities and Transport (MPUT) is responsible for&#13;
overseeing the energy sector and coordinating policies with the Planning Institute of&#13;
Jamaica (PIOJ). In order to bring together various entities and agencies involved, to&#13;
implement energy sector policy with private sector participation, a Minister's Steering&#13;
Committee on Energy Sector Privatization (MSC) was established in 1990 under the&#13;
chairmanship of the Minister of Energy. This Committee is composed largely of policy makers&#13;
from a wide range of institutions; its role has been to oversee and review the implementation of&#13;
energy sector projects. The Committee has been strengthened with the creation of an Energy&#13;
Sector Policy Implementation Unit (ESPTU) in MPUT to ensure timely implementation of&#13;
GOJ's policy and energy sector projects. A Project Manager, with private sector experience,&#13;
presently heads the unit.&#13;
2.3   The operative institutions in the sector are the Jamaica Public Service Co. (JPS)&#13;
and the Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica (PCJ). PCJ is a wholly owned state corporation&#13;
established under the Petroleum Act of 1979, and is a holding company for several subsidiaries.&#13;
The activities of PCJ and its subsidiaries include importing crude oil and petroleum products,&#13;
refining crude oil, exporting some products, distributing petroleum products and the&#13;
exploration, development and management of petroleum resources. It's most important&#13;
subsidiary is Petrojam, which owns and operates the country's only refinery. Under an agreed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5 -&#13;
program with the World Bank, Petrojam is now being privatized. PCJ's other significant&#13;
subsidiaries are the Petroleum Company of Jamaica (PETCOM), a petroleum marketing&#13;
subsidiary established in 1985, and Petronol, established in 1986, which produces ethanol. PCJ&#13;
is in the process of divesting most of these subsidiaries. At the same time, it has reduced the&#13;
size of its headquarters staff. The overall structure of petroleum product marketing and&#13;
distribution is dominated by three local affiliates of international companies (ESSO, Shell and&#13;
Texaco).&#13;
2.4   JPS, the only power utility in Jamaica, has had the sole responsibility for the&#13;
generation, transmission, and distribution of electric power for public consumption. The&#13;
GOJ has 99% ownership of the company which reports to MPUT. In addition to JPS,&#13;
there are a number of private independent generators of electricity who produce power for&#13;
their own consumption, i.e., the bauxite companies, the Caribbean Cement Company,&#13;
sugar estates and hotels. Of these, only the bauxite companies are connected to the grid&#13;
and provide it with a limited amount of electricity. Recently, JPS has entered into a&#13;
number of arrangements with Independent Power Producers to purchase power.&#13;
C. Government's Energy Sector Policy&#13;
2.5   The Government has a well-defined energy policy. The objectives of the energy&#13;
policy are to: (a) ensure stable and adequate energy supplies at the least economic cost&#13;
through a combination of public and private sector participation in a deregulated and&#13;
liberalized environment; (b) diversify the energy base, encourage the development of&#13;
indigenous energy resources where economically viable and technically feasible, and&#13;
ensure the security of energy supplies; (c) encourage efficiency in energy production,&#13;
conversion and use with the overall objectives of reducing the energy intensity of the&#13;
economy; (d) complement the country's industrial policy by recognizing the importance of&#13;
energy as a critical input to industrial growth and stability; (e) minimize the adverse&#13;
environmental effects and pollution caused by the production, storage, transport and use&#13;
of energy; and (f) establish an appropriate regulatory framework to protect consumers.&#13;
investors, the environment and sector entities.&#13;
2.6   The government expects to achieve these policy objectives by creating an enabling&#13;
environment to: (a) encourage private sector participation and investments through a&#13;
policy of divestment and appropriate regulatory framework; (b) promote the development&#13;
of indigenous energy sources where appropriate, technically and economically feasible; (c)&#13;
encourage energy conservation/efficiency on the supply side as well as demand side&#13;
management; (d) fully protect the environment while ensuring that adequate energy&#13;
supplies are available to the country and to sustain the desired rate of economic growth;&#13;
(e) maintain appropriate institutional arrangements to ensure that the stated objectives are&#13;
achieved; and stimulate industrial development by encouraging synergies from co-&#13;
generation. The protection of the environment remains a primary objective of the energy&#13;
policy and as such the environmental guidelines of the National Resource Conservation&#13;
Authority (NRCA) relating to the energy sector will be enforced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
2.7    At present Jamaica imports petroleum and petroleum products on favorable terms&#13;
from Venezuela and Mexico under the San Jose Accord. As long as these contractual&#13;
arrangements remain favorable from national interest point of view, they will be continued.&#13;
When the refinery is privatized, it is envisaged that the country will continue to enjoy the&#13;
benefits of crude oil supplies under the existing contractual arrangements. Given the&#13;
complete deregulation of the petroleum sector all individuals/entities are now free to&#13;
import crude and petroleum products. As the government believes that the processing of&#13;
crude is the desirable option and as such, will encourage refinery operation in the country&#13;
by way of a tariff differential.&#13;
2.8   In this context, the energy policy will: (a) provide competitive advantage for the&#13;
refining of petroleum through the granting of an appropriate differential between tariffs on&#13;
refinery feedstock and the importation of fully refined petroleum products; (b) seek to&#13;
enter into joint venture partnerships with the private sector with regards to the refinery&#13;
and other government owned energy entities; (c) review and optimize specifications for all&#13;
petroleum products to meet modern economic and environmental requirements; (d) ensure&#13;
that importers and marketers of petroleum will be required to supply the appropriate&#13;
ministry with timely and relevant information regarding imports, sales etc. The provision&#13;
of this information will be necessary for proper energy planning; (e) seek to ensure access&#13;
to common terminalling facilities on a transparent basis for all eligible marketers and&#13;
customers; (f) review and establish the policy for the pricing of petroleum products in&#13;
order to achieve the objective of withdrawing subsidies and promoting the policy of&#13;
energy conservation; (g) ensure that petroleum refinery/marketing companies will be&#13;
required to maintain a predetermined level of inventory. This level of inventory will&#13;
guarantee that the nation's petroleum supplies are maintained at the required level; and (h)&#13;
seek to maintain the protection of the environment and the preservation/encouragement of&#13;
natural and cultivated forests. Although, for example, government will cause overall&#13;
removal of subsidy on domestic kerosene to be gradually phased out, it will remain&#13;
committed to some direct subsidy to assist those poor households that can be identified as&#13;
totally dependent on that petroleum product for cooking and lighting.&#13;
2.9   GOJ has already carried out a series of actions to put in place its new sector&#13;
policy. Under support from Energy Sector Deregulation and Privatization Project (Ln&#13;
3502), establishment of ESPIU is assisting MPUT and MSC in the implementation of&#13;
energy related projects financed by multilateral agencies and the implementation of&#13;
privatization programs. Implementation of the energy policy entails that: (a) an&#13;
appropriate ministry will continue to have overall responsibility for the implementation of&#13;
the policy; (b) the ministry will create a central energy conservation and renewable unit&#13;
which will act as a facilitator for all new and renewable energy projects. This unit will&#13;
provide a central point for inputs from the public and the scientific community with regard&#13;
to technological developments etc. Ongoing information to the public will also be&#13;
provided by this unit; and (c) the Office of Utility Regulation (OUR), which will cover all&#13;
utility services, will be established in accordance with the Office of Utilities Regulation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7 -&#13;
Act, 1995. This office will protect the interests of both consumers and the investor in the&#13;
provision and utilization of public utility services. The OUR will have oversight&#13;
responsibility for the regulatory framework for the energy sector.&#13;
D. Energy Consumption and Supply&#13;
2.10  In comparison with countries at a similar stage of development, the level of energy&#13;
consumption in Jamaica is fairly high. This is primarily due to the needs of the bauxite and&#13;
alumina industry which is highly energy intensive. In 1993, Jamaica's gross per capita&#13;
energy requirement was estimated at about 8.7 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) or 1,309 kg&#13;
of oil equivalent (kgoe) which compares with the average per capita consumption of 650&#13;
kgoe for economies at a similar level of per capita income. When corrected for&#13;
consumption in the bauxite/alumina industry, which accounts for around 50% of total&#13;
demand, per capita requirements fall to 650kgoe.&#13;
2.11   Commercial energy accounts for 91% oftotal gross energy requirements. On an&#13;
end use basis, 91 % of commercial energy is used in the form of petroleum, 7% in the form&#13;
of electricity and about 2% in the form of coal by the cement industry. The bauxite&#13;
industry accounts for 50% of total energy use, the transport sector for about 17%, the&#13;
sugar industry for about 5%, and the household sector for about 10%.&#13;
2.12  Jamaica's petroleum demand is mainly met through local refining and direct import&#13;
of refined petroleum products. In 1993, Jamaica imported about 18.3 million barrels&#13;
(MMB) of petroleum and petroleum products. About 6.6 MMB of refined products were&#13;
imported directly by the bauxite/alumina industry. With a nominal capacity of 35.5&#13;
thousand barrels per day (MBPD)2, the refinery imported 5.4 MMB (17 MBPD) of&#13;
feedstock and 6.2 MMB (18.6 MBPD) of refined products. Of the total feed stock, crude&#13;
oil from Mexico and Venezuela accounted for 79.7% and spikes (refined products as part&#13;
of refinery feedstock) accounted for 20.3%.&#13;
2.13   During the past 23 years, gross energy supplies and requirements in Jamaica have&#13;
increased at 1.8% p. a. Non-bauxite demand has increased at a rate of 1.6% since 1989.&#13;
Bauxite industry demand is more erratic (it jumped from 3.2 million boe in 1988 to 4.9&#13;
million boe in 1989) and was 8 million boe in 1993. Historic income elasticity of demand&#13;
for non-bauxite energy is estimated at 1.6. It is assumed that in the long run GDP, in real&#13;
terms, would grow at an average rate of 3% in 1994-95 and at 3.5% thereafter. In the&#13;
bauxite and alumina sector, demand for energy is projected to increase in line with the rise&#13;
in alumina production; for every ton of alumina produced, around 2.48 boe of energy are&#13;
required. Alumina production is projected to increase from 2.9 million tons in 1992 to 3.5&#13;
million tons by 1996; 3.75 million tons by 2000; and 4.25 million tons by 2005. Assuming&#13;
that the energy requirements of the non-bauxite sector increase at 4% p.a., total energy&#13;
2Bottlenecks in the refuning process currently reduce the effective throughput capacity to 26.4 MBPD.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
demand in Jamaica up to 2005 is projected to grow at 3.4% p.a. The energy demand in&#13;
2000 is projected at about 25.8 million boe and in 2005 at 30.6 million boe.&#13;
E. Energy Pricing: Petroleum Products&#13;
2.14   Refinery-gate petroleum prices were decontrolled, in an initial phase, in September&#13;
1990. Every week the refinery publishes ex-refinery billing prices which are based on:&#13;
reference postings in the US Gulf, freight; ocean losses and insurance costs; imputed&#13;
terminal and financing costs to supply products ex-terminal; and a tax element which is&#13;
fixed by the Government. The oil companies add to this price their own operating margins&#13;
and transport costs, and establish wholesale prices to the retailers. The retail traders add&#13;
their operational costs and margins and post ex-outlet prices.&#13;
2.15   Prices from outlet to outlet and company to company vary, and reflect some&#13;
element of competition in the market. While the program of decontrolling petroleum&#13;
prices had proceeded smoothly, it could not achieve the objective of realistic competition&#13;
until the market was fully decontrolled through the introduction of Caricom Common&#13;
External Tariffs (CET) on April 1, 1993. CET allows the import of refinery feed stock at&#13;
a 5% tariff and import of refined products at 15% tariff.&#13;
2.16   As of November 1994, retail prices for gasoline were on the order of US$1.14-&#13;
1.29/US gallon (USG); diesel fuel retailed at US$1.05-1.15/USG. These prices compare&#13;
to FOB US Gulf prices of US$0.70/USG for gasoline and US$0.59/USG for diesel oil.&#13;
The markup is accounted for by duties (US$0.20/USG for gasoline and US$0.1 5/USG for&#13;
diesel), freight, insurance, handling costs and marketing margins.&#13;
2.17   As household kerosene is used for cooking by about 25% of the low income&#13;
population, it continues to be subsidized. To ensure that the intended consumers benefit&#13;
from this subsidy, it is sold to the urban and rural households through kerosene peddlers&#13;
and local shops in tins or bottles. GOJ is considering to decontrol the price of kerosene&#13;
and introduce kerosene stamps to provide direct subsidy to poor population. GOJ intends&#13;
to review taxes on two-burner kerosene and gas stoves to determine how to discourage&#13;
the use of charcoal. The price of kerosene as of October, 1994 was US$0.70/USG.&#13;
F. Lessons learned from previous Bank operations&#13;
2.18   The Bank has made five loans totaling US$150.5 million for power sector&#13;
development.3 These lending operations have involved financing construction of&#13;
generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, and providing technical assistance for&#13;
3These loans include: (i) Power I (No. 454-JM) for US$22 million, approved in 1966 and completed in 1972; (ii)&#13;
Power II (No. 1516-3M) for US$20 million, approved in 1978 and completed in 1984; (iii) Power HI (No. 2188-&#13;
3M) for USS30.5 million, approved in 1982 and completed in 1987; (iv) Power IV (No. 2869-JM) for US$18&#13;
million, approved in 1987 and completed in 1995; and (v) Energy Sector Deregulation and Privatization Project&#13;
(Ln. 3502-JM) for US$60 million, approved in 1992 to finance JPS (US$20 million) and to support a power plant&#13;
in the private sector (US$40 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9 -&#13;
improving operations and maintenance practices and overall efficiency of the JPS'&#13;
operations. The latter was particularly important during the implementation period of the&#13;
second loan (1516-JM of US$20.0 million, 1978) when adverse macroeconomic&#13;
conditions took their toll on the company. In addition, institution-building and training&#13;
and strengthening of sector human resources have all been a prominent focus of all Bank&#13;
lending operations in the Jamaican power sector.&#13;
2.19 The Third Power Project (Loan. 2188-JM, US$30.5 million) and Fourth Power&#13;
Project (Loan. 2869-JM, US$18 million), in addition to financing construction and&#13;
providing technical assistance and training, focused on rehabilitating plants and the&#13;
upgrading of the power system. The lessons learned from the Third Power Project have&#13;
been outlined and discussed in the Project Completion Report (Report No. 10252)&#13;
completed recently. The ongoing Fourth Power Project, approved in 1987, aimed at&#13;
improving operating efficiency within the JPS system by: (i) expanding and upgrading&#13;
transmission lines, substations and the distribution network; (ii) establishing a permanent&#13;
training center and training program; and (iii) providing engineering/consultant services for&#13;
JPS. The project was designed to help JPS meet its power needs through 1992. After&#13;
initial delays, the project is being implemented satisfactorily. The delays were primarily&#13;
due to: (a) the disruption and destruction to the system wrought by Hurricane Gilbert&#13;
which struck Jamaica in 1988; and (b) JPS' intemal procurement processes. The latter&#13;
constraint has been addressed by strengthening the Project Execution Unit (PEI) by&#13;
assigning a full time Project Director, and increasing the number of staff assigned to the&#13;
Unit. The training and studies components of the Project have been successfully&#13;
implemented. JPS also had difficulty in meeting the rate of return covenant of the loan,&#13;
except in 1992/93 when the RoR targets were exceeded. It is in compliance with all other&#13;
covenants. JPS' past financial performance and proposed measures to improve the&#13;
company's financial health are presented in part VI of this report.&#13;
2.20  In the petroleum subsector, the Bank has made one loan, the Petroleum&#13;
Exploration (Loan 2017-JM of 1981 for US$7.5 million), which was aimed at promoting&#13;
the exploration for and development of Jamaica's hydrocarbon potential. Although no&#13;
commercial discovery was reported, the project partially achieved its objectives by&#13;
increasing knowledge of the prospects of offshore and onshore areas. The negative results&#13;
of the exploration activities, and the lack of sound alternative uses led in January 1986 to&#13;
closure of the loan and cancellation of about 50% of the approved funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3. THE POWER SUB-SECTOR&#13;
A. Background&#13;
3.1   The basic legislation goveming the power sub-sector consists of the Electric&#13;
Lighting Act of 1890 and the Electricity Development Act of 1974. The Electricity&#13;
Development Act established the Electricity Authority as the Agency responsible for&#13;
power sub-sector development. In addition, the Electricity Authority is empowered to&#13;
regulate the license-holding utilities. Under the electricity legislation, GOJ granted to JPS,&#13;
in 1978, a 39-year "All Island Electric License", which gives JPS the monopoly to supply&#13;
electricity to all parts of the island, as the sole supplier of electricity for public&#13;
consumption.&#13;
3.2    Although the Electricity Authority exists as a legal entity, in practice the functions&#13;
of this agency are carried out by MPUT. JPS provides monthly financial reports to&#13;
MPUT. MPUT is closely involved in JPS' investment plans and operating budgets. Rate&#13;
adjustment requests are filed to MPUT. After review and analysis, MPUT submits its&#13;
recommendations on rate adjustments to the Cabinet for final approval.&#13;
B. Government's Power Sector Policy&#13;
3.3    GOJ has taken the decision to deregulate and liberalized the electricity sector,&#13;
thereby allowing Independent Power Producers (IPP) to be the main players within the&#13;
sector, with the government becoming a minority partner. In this regard, all new&#13;
generating capacity is to be provided by private developers. GOJ has also announced its&#13;
intention to privatize JPS and invited applications from intemational companies for&#13;
prequalification to bid. These are major policy initiatives which are aimed at moving the&#13;
entire system of generation, transmission and distribution into private sector ownership&#13;
and management. Major policy initiatives, therefore, in the power sector are to ensure&#13;
that an appropriate regulatory framework is put in place to: (a) facilitate the timely&#13;
provision of new power generating capacity and the associated transmission works; (b)&#13;
establish an environment capable of attracting private investments in the power sector and&#13;
capable of supporting long term financing for the private sector; and (c) generally support&#13;
Jamaica's power sector privatization program.&#13;
3.4   The policy is intended to ensure that: (a) all new generation projects are&#13;
undertaken by the private sector; (b) the potential of co-generation to meet some portion&#13;
of electricity supply will be pursued and principles under which the electricity company&#13;
purchases electricity from co-generators, are clearly set out; (c) the company responsible&#13;
for generation capacity planning prepares a periodic least cost expansion plan for review&#13;
and approval of the competent authority; (d) the widespread publication of the indicative&#13;
least cost plan provides guidance to potential private sector investors in the development&#13;
of proposals for new plants; (e) appropriate regulatory oversight is put in place; (f)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
electricity rate setting mechanism reflects the cost of power from private suppliers; and (g)&#13;
the Rural Electrification Programme (REP) is continued in order to maintain the extension&#13;
of electricity to rural areas with a view to fostering economic development and improving&#13;
the quality of life in rural communities.&#13;
3.5   Rate setting principles being followed by the power sector are: (a) rates should&#13;
reflect full costs including duties and taxes; (b) overall revenue requirements to be&#13;
established on the basis of existing loan agreements with international agencies and GOJ to&#13;
meet rate of return and/or self-financing tests; (c) indexing of foreign exchange and fuel&#13;
rate adjustment; and (d) tariffs to be structured according to long run marginal cost&#13;
principles reflecting peak and off-peak costs, voltage levels, capacity and energy costs.&#13;
The cost of long term power purchase agreements would also be reflected in the tariffs. It&#13;
was agreed that JPS will commission a comprehensive long run marginal cost study which&#13;
will be used as a basis for restructuring the tariffs.&#13;
C. Electricity Demand and Supply&#13;
3.6   In FY93/94, JPS's system generated a total of 2,266 GWh and the gross system&#13;
peak was 382 MW. Sales of electricity amounted to 1,838 GWh, delivered to some&#13;
352,700 customers across the island. In the last three years net generation and total kWh&#13;
sales have been stable, showing a relatively low growth (roughly 4.6% per annum) if&#13;
compared with previous years.&#13;
3.7   Market share is accounted for as follows: large commercial and industrial&#13;
customers account for 18.4% of kWh sales, the medium and small commercial and&#13;
industrial user's share is 46.8%, and the residential sector accounts for about 32%. The&#13;
number of customers increased by 9% in the last two years (by comparison, the increase&#13;
during FY90/91-91/92 was only 2.5%). Residential consumers make up 89.3% of the&#13;
total number of clients. Almost 10.3% of the customers belong to the small commercial&#13;
and industrial sector and the remaining 0.1 % are a few large industrial (75) and street&#13;
lighting (306) customers.&#13;
3.8   About 63% of the total population lives in dwellings which have access to&#13;
electricity, compared to 50% in 1985. Electricity consumption is concentrated in the&#13;
metropolitan areas of Kingston and Montego Bay which account for about 65% and 10%&#13;
of the country's total electric energy consumption, respectively. Average electricity&#13;
consumption per capita in 1993 was about 850 kWh/year, based on net generation. 1993&#13;
census data indicates that about 45% of the population lives in rural areas and from this&#13;
total about 40% are connected to the grid.&#13;
3.9   In order to accelerate the integration of the rural areas to the electrical grid, GOJ&#13;
created the REP in 1975, an independent entity, separate from JPS, to administer the rural&#13;
electrification program. The program consists of extensions from existing JPS lines, and&#13;
the provision of loans to assist homeowners in carrying out house installations. REP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
receives soft financing from the Government (through loans from international agencies).&#13;
GOJ will continue to support the rural electrification program to extend electricity service&#13;
to foster economic development and improve the quality of life in rural communities.&#13;
3.10  Demand for electricity is expected to grow at about 5.6% annually in the next 10&#13;
years. The base demand forecast reflects GOJ's assumption on GDP and other economic&#13;
indicators (population growth, per capita electricity consumption, etc.). Annex 3.1 shows&#13;
historical demand and forecasts for the 1995-2013 period. The base demand forecast can&#13;
be summarized as follows:&#13;

3.11  Electricity is generated in four thermal and eight small hydroelectric plants. The&#13;
distribution of generation between plants and type of units during FY 1993/94 was as&#13;
follows:&#13;

3.12  Two types of fuel are used in the thermal plants; Bunker C Fuel Oil (FO) in the&#13;
steam and diesel units, and Diesel Oil (DO) in the gas turbines. Total fuel consumed in&#13;
FY93/94 was 3.75 million barrels of FO and 0.77 million barrels of DO. The most&#13;
efficient units are the diesel sets at Rockfort with an average heat rate of 9,170 BTU/kWh,&#13;
followed by the steam units at Old Harbour with 12,070 BTU/kWh. The gas turbines at&#13;
Bogue have an average heat rate of 16,438 BTU/kWh. The system average thermal plant&#13;
efficiency was around 13,000 Btu/kWh; the target estabiished in the previous Bank loan&#13;
was 12,550 BTU/kWh.&#13;
3.13  At the end of May 1994, JPS's total installed capacity was 621.7 MW, with an&#13;
available maximum continuous rating (MCR) of 568 MW. From this, about 23.6 MW&#13;
(3.7%) correspond to the eight small hydroelectric plants. The thermal generation is&#13;
composed of steam, gas turbines and diesel units, located at four different plant sites. The&#13;
largest plant is Old Harbour (OH) with four oil-fired steam units and a total of 230 MW&#13;
installed capacity. Nominal capacity of each of the two units 3 and 4 at OH are 55 MW&#13;
and 68.5 MW respectively (the largest unit in the system). At Hunt's Bay (HB) there are&#13;
four oil-fired steam units (unit number 2 is considered, for all practical purposes, already&#13;
retired) and five gas turbines, with 116 and 111.3 MW, respectively. At Bogue, in&#13;
Montego Bay, there were five gas turbines with a total installed capacity of 100.8 MW.&#13;
At Rockfort a barge with two identical diesel units of 20 MW each, provides 40MW of&#13;
capacity.&#13;
3.14  On June 3, 1994, an explosion occurred at OH unit number 4 boiler. The&#13;
explosion and subsequent fire, caused almost the complete destruction of the boiler, its&#13;
auxiliary, electrical and control systems, the main stores building and the chemical and&#13;
water treatment laboratory. Parts of the crane, the stack and the turbine-generator set of&#13;
unit number 4 were also damaged. In addition, the boiler of unit number 3 and auxiliaries&#13;
suffered damage. In total 137 MW (about 123 MW available MCR) were lost, equivalent&#13;
to more than 20% of the total available capacity. Subsequently JPS signed a private&#13;
power deal for 42 MW new peaking capacity at Bogue. The proposed project would&#13;
address the restoration of Old Harbour plant and other related power generation reliability&#13;
concerns.&#13;
3.15  The main transmission voltages in the JPS system are 138 and 69 kV. There is a&#13;
total of approximately 270 km of single-circuit 138 kV and 720 km of 69 kV transmission&#13;
lines which interconnect the generating plant with the main load centers. The 69 kV&#13;
system includes a ring and provides the primary supply to most of the main distribution&#13;
substations. The lines and associated substations, of this trunk transmission system are&#13;
relatively new and in good condition.&#13;
3.16  The incident at OH and changes required to accommodate the emergency&#13;
generation recovery plan will create some short term transmission constraints in the&#13;
system. Modifications to the transmission system included in the proposed project will&#13;
address transmission constraint.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
D. System Losses&#13;
3.17  In the last five years average system losses have been in the order of 20%, despite&#13;
major investments in the distribution system and the activities and measures carried out by&#13;
JPS's Power Loss Reduction Unit during the last three years. Total electrical system&#13;
energy losses in FY 93/94 amounted to 19.4%, a reduction of 1.6% from the 21% figure&#13;
for FY 92/93. A breakdown of total losses yields losses of 2.5% in the transmission&#13;
system which are reasonable, but distribution losses on the order of 16.9% (8.5% technical&#13;
and 8.4% non-technical) which are well above the standards for the industry. Non-&#13;
technical losses amount to about 43.5% of total losses. Renewed and more aggressive&#13;
actions are required from JPS on this front. A specific action program to reduce energy&#13;
losses, particularly non-technical losses, is a part of the Corporate Action Plan. The&#13;
progress of this Plan will be monitored during project implementation.&#13;
E. Electricity Tariffs&#13;
3.18   The existing tariff schedule is based on a straightforward structure: (i) a&#13;
Residential Service (Rate 10) with two energy blocks and a customer fixed charge; (ii) a&#13;
General Service (Rate 20) with a flat energy charge and a fixed customer charge; (iii) a&#13;
Power Service (Rate 40) with demand and energy charges, a fixed customer charge, a&#13;
time-of-day option and transformer discount; (iv) a Large Power Service (Rate 50),&#13;
similar to rate 40 except time of day discount applicable to primary service; and (v) a&#13;
Street Lighting Service (Rate 60) with a flat rate per type of lamp. All rates incorporate a&#13;
fuel adjustment clause which provides for six monthly (albeit lagged) adjustments&#13;
according to fuel cost variations, and a foreign exchange adjustment clause which allows&#13;
JPS to recover tariff loss due to exchange rate changes, linked to its foreign currency&#13;
expenses (estimated to be on average 75% of its total costs).&#13;
3.19  Average revenues for JPS are currently on the order of US Cents 12.5/kWh. They&#13;
have decreased from a level of 13.5 to 14.0 US Cents per kWh in October 1992 (date of&#13;
the latest adjustment), despite the automatic adjustment clauses. One reason for this&#13;
decline lies in the absence of an automatic adjustment to track the relatively high local&#13;
inflation. JPS in the recent past has been unable to meet covenanted 8% rate of return on its&#13;
fixed assets. GOJ has taken measures to deal with both this issues. Having announced its&#13;
intention to privatize JPS, GOJ is in the process of revaluing JPS' assets based on their realistic&#13;
market value. Based on a 13.4% requested increase in tariffs at the beginning of the fiscal year,&#13;
JPS has projected that it will yield a 6% return on current valuation of assets. If, as is most&#13;
likely, this increase is delayed until October 1995, the projected return will drop to 4.2%. As a&#13;
consequence of the explosion and streamlining of its organizational structure prior to&#13;
privatization, JPS is expected to incur one time additional expenses of about J$832 million in&#13;
FY95/96. If these expenses were excluded, and the requested tariff increase is only effective in&#13;
October 1995, the rate of return would be about 8.8%. During the mid-term review of the&#13;
ESDPP, JPS' financial performnance will be critically reviewed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
3.20 Concerning tariff levels, C&amp;L performed a preliminary evaluation of long-run&#13;
marginal costs as part of the restructuring study in 1992. The study showed that at that&#13;
time tariffs exceeded the long run marginal costs by about 15%. Additionally, the study&#13;
showed that significant differences existed between tariffs and marginal cost for individual&#13;
customer categories, ranging from +35% for residential customers to -3% for power&#13;
service. C&amp;L forewarned that due to the limited information available on customer load&#13;
characteristics, results for individual customer categories should be used cautiously. As&#13;
part of the Power IV Project (Loan 2869-JM) a load research program is at present in&#13;
place to determine reliable load composition parameters which should be used for the&#13;
assessment and allocation of costs for tariff setting purposes.&#13;
&#13;

4. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Background&#13;
4.1   Following the explosion and consequent fire at OH unit number 4 on June 3, 1994,&#13;
JPS suffered a major reduction in its power generating capacity. In addition to the&#13;
destruction of the unit number 4 boiler and its auxiliaries, the explosion also caused severe&#13;
damage to the unit number 3 boiler. The damage from the incident also included the&#13;
destruction of the control building, control equipment, unit electrical auxiliary equipment,&#13;
damage to the turbine-generator bearings and the destruction of the chemical laboratory&#13;
building and of the stores building. Investigations indicate two possible causes which may&#13;
have led to the incident: (a) fuel explosion in the furnace of the boiler of Unit No. 4; or (b)&#13;
over pressure in the boiler of Unit No. 4, possibly due to generating tube failure. Forensic&#13;
Technology International, an international firm of consultants, has concluded that JPS&#13;
"had adopted reasonable approach to maintaining safe operational conditions."&#13;
4.2   The incident resulted in a reduction of 123 MW capacity thus reducing the&#13;
available baseload capacity by 33%. As a result, the system's installed margin was&#13;
severely reduced from 49% to 17%. The units lost in the incident were two of the large&#13;
base load units in the system. Units 3 and 4 are similar oil-fired steam plants with MCR&#13;
ratings of 55MW and 68.5MW, respectively (Foster Wheeler boilers and General Electric&#13;
turbines). They were installed in 1972/73.&#13;
4.3   The loss of these units has led to much higher load factors on older generating&#13;
capacity normally used for peaking and standby service, with consequent reduction of&#13;
system reliability. This was manifested after the incident by rotating blackouts. The loss of&#13;
two of the lowest operating cost units also resulted in an increased operating cost in&#13;
excess of US$50,000 per day. The costs imposed on JPS as a result of the incident also&#13;
affected other developments planned by JPS. These projects included the restoration and&#13;
upgrade of three gas turbines, telecommunication and energy management system&#13;
improvements.&#13;
B. Emergency Generation Recovery Program&#13;
4.4   Immediately after the explosion, JPS developed and implemented an Emergency&#13;
Generation Recovery Program to:&#13;
&#149; Identify the extent of the damage, scope of work, lead time and cost to restore OH&#13;
units number 3 and number 4 to service.&#13;
&#149; Implement practical emergency measures to alleviate the situation,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
Review and revise JPS's generation strategy to restore the system to normal in the&#13;
shortest possible time and to adjust the long term plans.&#13;
4.5   This plan determined the best effort lead times to restore Old Harbour units&#13;
number 3 and number 4, as follows:&#13;
Lead Time          In-Service Date&#13;
Old Harbour unit number 3      6 months           December 1994&#13;
Old Harbour unit number 4     13 months           July 1995&#13;
4.6   Due to the extent of the loss, JPS has implemented the following steps:&#13;
* An aggressive demand management program and planned load shedding schedule&#13;
* Major adjustments to the planned maintenance schedule&#13;
* The procurement of emergency capacity&#13;
* An aggressive implementation schedule to rehabilitate the damaged units.&#13;
4.7   Emergency capacity has been obtained by negotiating a three-year supply contract&#13;
with Kenetech who will provide 40MW from gas turbine sets at Bogue (peaking units).&#13;
4.8   The decision to repair Old Harbour unit 3 was straightforward: the unit was not&#13;
irreparably damaged and the materials were on-site for the planned overhaul of unit&#13;
number 4; these factors plus an established lead time of 6 months to repair unit number 3&#13;
led to a quick decision to proceed immediately to restore the unit. The decision to replace&#13;
or rebuild unit number 4 required investigation of the lead time to replace the boiler and&#13;
other damaged components as well as the economics of procuring a different plant&#13;
configuration.&#13;
4.9   The replacement options considered were:&#13;
* replace the damaged components by sole source negotiated contract&#13;
*  intemational competitive tender for a new boiler and replacement components&#13;
* discontinue use of unit number 4 turbine and replace the unit with new generating&#13;
equipment&#13;
4.10  To investigate the shortest lead time to repair unit number 4, JPS requested&#13;
proposals from the original boiler supplier, Foster-Wheeler, and from a reputable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
competitor, Babcock-Wilcox. The original supplier submitted a proposal with a 7 month&#13;
schedule from order to first steam; the alternate proposal was based on a schedule of 13.5&#13;
months. An additional two months were considered necessary to complete all the repairs.&#13;
Through this process, JPS concluded a contract with Foster-Wheeler to replace the boiler&#13;
and auxiliaries and rebuild the balance of damaged plant.&#13;
4.11  In addition to the repair and rebuild of the two Old Harbour units, JPS identified&#13;
the feasibility of implementing the life extension and upgrading work on three GE Frame 5&#13;
gas turbine generating sets which have been used by JPS for peaking and standby&#13;
purposes. One of them is located at the Bogue power station and the other two are&#13;
located at Hunts Bay power station.&#13;
C. Project Objectives and Description&#13;
4.12  Objectives. The proposed project has the following objectives:&#13;
*  To restore electricity service to normal conditions as early as possible, thus&#13;
eliminating costly power cuts;&#13;
*  To reduce generation costs through lower running cost plants, save on capital costs&#13;
by upgrading existing facilities and safeguard the system against the breakdown of&#13;
existing units due to extended use;&#13;
* To improve generation security, enhance system reliability and control systems to&#13;
reduce the likelihood of future recurrence of generating plant incidents by&#13;
improving the telecommunications and energy control systems and by reinforcing&#13;
the transmission network;&#13;
*  To improve resource allocation through the reform of electricity tariffs and ensure&#13;
that loss of base load generation capacity does not adversely affect the environment&#13;
for increasing private sector participation in the power sector; and&#13;
*  To reduce and control the environmental impact associated with power system&#13;
facilities.&#13;
4.13   Project Components. To achieve its objectives, the overall project will consist of&#13;
the following elements:&#13;
* Restoration of Old Harbour Unit 3;&#13;
* Restoration of Old Harbour Unit 4 boiler;&#13;
* Life extension of Old Harbour Unit 4 generation turbine;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
* Gas turbine Units 3, 4 and 5 upgrade;&#13;
* Transmission system reinforcements; and&#13;
* Upgrading of the energy control center and associated telecommunications&#13;
facilities;&#13;
4.14  Additionally, consulting services will be required for:&#13;
* technical supervision and project management for the generating system&#13;
components of the project;&#13;
*  engineering and project management for the environmental mitigation component&#13;
of the project.&#13;
-  cost of service and tariff reform studies;&#13;
A detailed description of the components of the project is presented in Annex 4. 1.&#13;
4.15   Restoration of Old Harbour Unit 3. This component of the project comprises&#13;
repairs to the boiler and rehabilitation to both boiler and turbine. JPS has used the&#13;
opportunity to rehabilitate the unit by redirecting a contract which was in place for a major&#13;
overhaul of unit number 4 in order to minimize the lead time required for essential repairs.&#13;
Originally JPS had established the return to service of unit number 3 as of February 1995;&#13;
but, the progress on this portion of the work was ahead of schedule and the unit returned&#13;
to service in December 1994. Financing for this component was provided by IDB.&#13;
4.16   Restoration of Old Harbour Unit 4 Boiler. The work contemplated for this&#13;
component of the project consists of rebuilding the boiler to improved specifications and&#13;
associated fuel handling, fuel burning, steam and feedwater piping, fan and stack which&#13;
were destroyed or damaged. In addition, this component includes rebuilding of the&#13;
control facilities, the chemical laboratory and stores building and their equipment.&#13;
4.17  The costs of repair or replacement plant and structures is covered by an all riskC&#13;
insurance policy. The insurers' liability is limited to replacement or repair of the plant,&#13;
equipment and buildings at the lowest cost and in the most expeditious manner in order to&#13;
limit the consequential losses incurred by higher operating costs. Based oni the&#13;
negotiations and investigations carried out by JPS, it has been determined that:&#13;
* the drums from the damaged boiler on unit numrber 4 can be repaired and reused;&#13;
and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
* the lead time required to return the steamn generating facilities to service could be&#13;
reduced to 7 months from date of order by direct negotiation of a design, supply&#13;
and install contract with the original supplier, Foster-Wheeler.&#13;
4.18   The total estimate for repair, replacement and life extension of unit number 4 is&#13;
about US$31 million. JPS's main problem has been to secure financing for rebuilding the&#13;
plant. JPS is unable to fund the rebuild by itself In their investigation of the lowest cost&#13;
to achieve a return to service, JPS identified alternate financing methods. The sources&#13;
considered were insurance advances, IBRD financing, and supplier credit:&#13;
* The insurers have made advances of about US$2.2 million against the Loss&#13;
Adjuster's recommendation for an advance of US$ 10.0 million. JPS has been&#13;
advised that there is disagreement among the group of insurers about the extent of&#13;
4&#13;
liability between each insurer.&#13;
*  In order to utilize IBRD financing, JPS would be required to seek international&#13;
competitive bids for the repair and replacement. The mission established a best&#13;
effort schedule for this exercise of 18 months based on a lead time required to&#13;
prepare tender documents, bid period, bid evaluation and award of 4 months plus&#13;
12 months from order to first steam and 2 months for final completion.&#13;
*  The main component which defines the 12 month period is the supply of new boiler&#13;
drums. In ongoing negotiations, JPS has received an offer from Foster-Wheeler&#13;
for supplier's credit together with a technical proposal to re-utilize the drums from&#13;
the original boiler and to meet a schedule of 7 months from order to first steam.&#13;
4.19   Accordingly, the only and least cost approach for JPS for the repair and&#13;
replacement of Old Harbour Unit number 4 steam generating facilities and associated&#13;
equipment and buildings was to proceed with finalizing the negotiations with Foster-&#13;
Wheeler, the original manufacturers of the boiler.&#13;
4.20 Life Extension of Old Harbour Unit 4 Generation Turbine. Prior to the&#13;
explosion, JPS had in place a contract to carry out rehabilitation work on Unit 4 in August&#13;
1994; the necessary materials were on order and most of them had been delivered. After&#13;
the incident, JPS established that the shortest time frame required to return Unit 3 to&#13;
service was 6 months; this was based on using the materials and contract already in place&#13;
for the planned work on Unit 4.&#13;
4.21   Having adopted this strategy, JPS developed a new approach to the rehabilitation&#13;
of Unit 4. Considering the replacement of the Unit 4 boiler and auxiliaries with new&#13;
components, an opportunity arose to carry out a comprehensive life extension program on&#13;
the Unit 4 turbine-generating facility to enable JPS to defer the unit's retirement from&#13;
As of the time of negotiation JPS had received US$25 million against the approved US$35 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
2002 to around 2017. The investigation by JPS led to a plan to incorporate detailed&#13;
design modifications to the turbine-generator set as well as some of the turbine auxiliary&#13;
systems. JPS received a detailed proposal from the original manufacturer (GE) and is&#13;
negotiating a contract for implementation in parallel with the boiler replacement&#13;
component. The project preparation mission recommended additional work on turbine&#13;
auxiliaries to improve efficiency and reliability over the extended life of the unit.&#13;
4.22 The only way to ensure that the life extension can be completed in parallel with the&#13;
boiler replacement, is that this component be dealt with by direct negotiation with the&#13;
original manufacturer, GE. This is also shown to be the most cost effective alternative.&#13;
The proposed Bank project will finance this component.&#13;
4.23   Gas Turbines Units 3, 4 and 5 Upgrade. This project component comprises&#13;
restoration and life extension of three Frame 5 General Electric gas turbines. The gas&#13;
turbines were installed in 1973 and 1974 and were scheduled to be decommissioned 1997&#13;
and 1998. The units have been operated as peak load capacity with a total operating&#13;
hours ranging from 26,000 to 45,000 hours. As a result of the loss of generating capacity&#13;
at Old Harbour, these units are now operating at higher load factors.&#13;
4.24  The proposed project component consists of replacing parts of the gas turbines&#13;
with new and modem equipment in order to improve unit efficiency, to increase their&#13;
reliability and to extend the technical life by about 10 years. The anticipated performance&#13;
improvements include an increased output of about 5% and reductions in heat rates&#13;
ranging from 2.3% to 10.5%. The duration of the required work is estimated at two&#13;
months for each unit.&#13;
4.25  Upgrade and life extension programs on existing plant are an increasingly common&#13;
practice in the utility industry due to the capital cost of new plants and the problems&#13;
associated with siting of new facilities. Upgrading of existing plant also permits utilities to&#13;
incorporate the benefits of ongoing research and development work undertaken by the&#13;
equipment manufacturers. In order to ensure the success of such programs, it is common&#13;
practice in the industry to negotiate a contract with the original designer/manufacturer of&#13;
the plant because of the risk of failure to meet expectations involved with trying to&#13;
incorporate components from other suppliers.&#13;
4.26  JPS has negotiated the life extension contract for GTs with GE. Work on GT Unit&#13;
3 started in February 1995 on an urgent basis as this Unit was no longer operable. The&#13;
target date for GT Units 4 and 5, is March 1995. JPS will finance this project component.&#13;
4.27 Telecommunication and Energy Management Systems (EMS). The existing&#13;
EMS, has become obsolete: the system has been abandoned by Harris Computer, the&#13;
initial contractor and training is no longer offered for the present facilities. The same&#13;
considerations apply to the existing telecommunications system; at present, the network&#13;
includes analog microwave radio which spans five major repeater stations; the system has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
various problems such as high fault rates, unreliable Power Line Carrier equipment,&#13;
insufficient standby radio links, an insecure network arrangement, a lack of a&#13;
Communication Control facility, low channel capacity, no expansion capability, and&#13;
dependence on the Public Telecommunications Company.&#13;
4.28   The project will supply a new EMS based on a distributed system architecture and&#13;
will support Automatic Generation Control to reduce system operating costs and&#13;
supervisory control for all Remote Terminal Units in order to improve system reliability.&#13;
The new system will be able to manage incoming alarms in a clear, concise and timely&#13;
manner and will manage load shedding functions under emergency situations. The project&#13;
will supply a digital microwave network consisting of a 2 GHz backbone radio, UHF&#13;
digital radios and the necessary multiplex and auxiliary equipment.&#13;
4.29  Transmission and Substation Reinforcements. To accommodate the scheduled&#13;
addition of 72MW of new generating capacity at Old Harbour (Wartsila/Iamaica Energy&#13;
Partners barge), it is necessary to provide reinforcements to the transmission system to&#13;
assure the interconnection of this new facility and the reliable transmissi n of power from&#13;
Old Harbour. The proposed reinforcements consist of:&#13;
* Construction of 32km of 138kV lines between Parnassus and Spur Tree with&#13;
attendant substation facilities for interconnection;&#13;
X Construction of 16km of 138kV lines between Spur Tree and Kendal with&#13;
attendant substation facilities; and&#13;
* Substation expansion to accommodate the Wartsila/JEP 72MW barge&#13;
The total estimated cost for these transmission and substation modifications is approximately&#13;
US$ 12 million which is being financed by IDB.&#13;
4.30  Environmental Mitigation Measures. This component of the project comprises&#13;
the development and implementation of measures recommended in the EA report for the&#13;
Old Harbour Plant. These measures include:&#13;
* Implementing sulfur dioxide mitigatory measures;&#13;
* Provision of a waste-water treatment plant;&#13;
* Oil spill prevention, containment and counter measures;&#13;
* Environmental training of JPS personnel,&#13;
* Laboratory upgrading; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
Asbestos and PCB surveys and preparation of management plans.&#13;
4.31   Other measures recommended in this and previous environmental reports (such as&#13;
improved boiler controls, stack emissions monitoring and on-line condenser tube cleaning)&#13;
are included in this project component for Old Harbour plant site. A detailed discussion of&#13;
the environmental issues and mitigation plan is presented in Annex 4.3.&#13;
D. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
4.32   The Bank has a long term involvement in the energy sector and so far has financed&#13;
five power and one petroleum sector projects. With the deregulation and privatization of&#13;
public sector entities, the character of the public sector investments is changing with&#13;
increased opportunities for the private sector and IFC investments.&#13;
4.33   The GOJ is clearly committed to sector reform involving regulation and private&#13;
sector participation through its energy sector and power sector policy initiatives. As a&#13;
consequence, JPS is implementing a major restructuring of its corporate organization in&#13;
order to incorporate efficiency incentives through market measures. However, during the&#13;
period JPS is being prepared for privatization, it is essential that its generation facilities be&#13;
maintained. Similarly, a regulated enterprise, should be able to manage its transmission&#13;
system with a high degree of reliability and to dispatch all generation facilities.&#13;
4.34   Bank support for the proposed project will ensure that the system can return to&#13;
normal generating conditions, thereby allowing the power sector reorganization plan to&#13;
proceed smoothly. Given the Bank's recent experience in structuring private sector&#13;
projects and its in-depth knowledge of the country, the project will be implemented on a&#13;
fast track basis. By allowing expanded energy supplies, the project also conforms to the&#13;
Bank's initiative for supporting infrastructure developments which are necessary to&#13;
enhance growth and reduce poverty, as noted in the 1994 CEM.&#13;
E. Status of Project Preparation&#13;
4.35   Project preparation is well advanced for most components. The status of each of&#13;
the components, at the time of negotiations is as follows:&#13;
*  The repair and rehabilitation of Old Harbour Unit 3 is complete;&#13;
* A contract for Unit 4 boiler and auxiliaries replacement and repair of other plant&#13;
components is in its final stages through direct negotiation with Foster Wheeler, the&#13;
selected supplier;&#13;
* The contract rehabilitation and life extension for Unit 4 turbine-generator set is&#13;
now being finalized with GE;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
* The life extension and upgrade of three gas turbines is now being implemented;&#13;
* The telecommunication technical specifications have been completed; basic design&#13;
and feasibility for the expansion of the Energy Management System has been&#13;
completed; and&#13;
*  The environrnental assessment of the project is at final stages and the&#13;
recommended mitigation measures will form part of the proposed project.&#13;
4.36  JPS has a project organization and structure in place for the generation-related&#13;
components. The environmental mitigation component will be addressed by engaging a&#13;
consulting firm to prepare specifications for tendering for the design, supply and&#13;
installation of the required facilities; the consulting firm will also provide contract&#13;
performance assistance to the JPS' Project Executing Unit (PEU). The project also&#13;
includes the provision of consulting services to the JPS project group for the generation&#13;
components. JPS will retain ECC, Inc. in order to prepare functional designs,&#13;
specifications and tender documents for the EMS component.&#13;
F. Project Cost Estimate&#13;
4.37  Project costs at December 1994 price levels are estimated to amount to the&#13;
equivalent of US$ 72.2 million, of which US$ 62.7 million (87%) correspond to foreign&#13;
costs. The estimated costs include physical and price contingencies and exclude taxes and&#13;
duties. Interest during construction (IDC) is estimated to amount to US$ 4.3 million.&#13;
Total financing requirements amount to US$ 76.5 million. Annex 4.4 provides a detailed&#13;
cost estimate. A summary of the estimated project costs is shown in the following table.&#13;

4.38  Due to the scope of the proposed project, the individual components are of&#13;
different nature; consequently different approaches have been used to establish the project&#13;
cost estimates. Approximately 70 % of the base cost estimates are determined from offers&#13;
received from potential contractors and suppliers. This is the case for important project&#13;
components such as the restoration and rehabilitation works at the Old Harbour Power&#13;
Station (OH) units, and the gas turbine upgrade. The estimated cost of environmental&#13;
mitigation measures is to be considered as preliminary; it was based on site inspections at&#13;
the OH Station and cost estimates included in an environmental assessment report&#13;
prepared by a German consulting company. Other project component costs have been&#13;
determined based upon known unit prices and engineering judgment.&#13;
4.39  The cost estimates for the consulting services and project management support&#13;
have been estimated by using different approaches. For the environmental mitigation&#13;
measures the costs are estimated to amount to around 10 % of the base cost estimate for&#13;
that project component, which is in line with common practice for such projects. The cost&#13;
estimates for the remaining parts of the consulting services and project management&#13;
support is based on estimated man-month requirements and needs for technical support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
4.40 For the foreign costs, which mainly include materials, equipment and technical&#13;
support of specialists, a physical contingency of 5% has been added to the base price&#13;
estimates. Physical contingencies for the local currency component, which comprises&#13;
labor costs and some civil works, were estimated at approximately 10 % of the local&#13;
costs. Interest during construction (based on 7.5% p.a.) for a project component is&#13;
calculated as the full interest on the estimated component cost during a period equal to&#13;
half of the estimated implementation time.&#13;
G. Project Financing Plan&#13;
4.41  The project financing plan is shown in the table below. In the proposed project the&#13;
Bank would finance foreign currency project components equivalent to US$ 21 million.&#13;

4.42 Implementation of non-Bank financed components will take place in parallel with&#13;
the IBRD financed project. Financing of US$26-27 million by JPS is expected to originate&#13;
mainly from the insurance settlement. Therefore, the net funding required from JPS from&#13;
its internal cash generation would amount to around US$ 5 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

H. Project Implementation Plan&#13;
4.43  The emergency recovery plan has required an early start regarding recovery works&#13;
at Old Harbour and the preparation and implementation of some proposed project compo-&#13;
nents has already commenced. In particular, this is the case for project components&#13;
directly related to damages caused by the explosion and foreseen to be covered totally&#13;
and/or partly by the Insurer.&#13;
4.44  For project components related to the generation improvement program, the&#13;
procurement activities started in early 1995 and all project components are expected to be&#13;
completed by the end of 1997. The table below shows the implementation schedule for the&#13;
different project components. A Time Schedule for the proposed project is found in Annex&#13;
4.6. The project will be implemented by JPS and the proceeds of the Loan will be onlent&#13;
to JPS by the Borrower at the same terms and conditions of the Loan. For this purpose,&#13;
the Borrower will sign a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with JPS. The signing of this&#13;
Agreement will be a condition for effectiveness.&#13;

4.45  During the project implementation phase JPS will make use of its existing PEU,&#13;
which has gained experience from other Bank-financed projects, such as the Fourth Power&#13;
Project and from the on-going restoration works at the OH Power Station. The PEU will&#13;
be in charge of the proposed project and will appoint a qualified Project Manager. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Project Manager will coordinate the activities with other areas of JPS, such as the&#13;
production and financial sectors of the generation Division. Further, the Project Manager&#13;
will liaise with the environmental department under the Corporate Service Sector of JPS.&#13;
Project management, preparation of engineering and procurement documents, evaluation&#13;
of bids, implementation of physical project components and environmental mitigation&#13;
measures would be performed by the PEU with the assistance of an international&#13;
consulting firm. Within JPS, the present PEU is an integral part of the Transmission&#13;
Engineering Section, which in turn reports to the Senior Director of the division for&#13;
transmission, Transdiv. The overall organization chart of JPS is shown in Annex 6.1; the&#13;
organization of the PEU is shown in Annex 4.2. PEU will submit monthly progress&#13;
reports to ESPIU, which will ensure that project implementation programs run smoothly.&#13;
ESPIU will submit to the Bank quarterly reports.&#13;
4.46  Project Monitoring. Performance targets have been established to: (i) measure&#13;
the timely and efficient execution of the project; and (ii) improve the overall performance&#13;
of JPS. The execution of the project will be monitored against target dates shown in the&#13;
implementation schedule shown in Annex 4.6. The implementation of the environmental&#13;
mitigation measures would be monitored against the plan to be agreed with JPS before the&#13;
loan becomes effective.&#13;
I. Procurement Procedures&#13;
4.47  JPS has established its own procurement procedure for project components not&#13;
financed by the Bank. For those project components which will be financed by the Bank&#13;
the applicable Bank procurement procedures will be applied (para. 4.48). JPS is familiar&#13;
with these procedures; the procurement of Bank financed project components will be&#13;
carried out with the assistance of an experienced procurement consultant, to be financed&#13;
under the project.&#13;
4.48  The following table summarizes the procurement procedure to be applied for the&#13;
different project components:&#13;

4.49   The life extension program of the Old Harbour Unit 4 will require deliveries of&#13;
specially manufactured parts designed for the installed turbine. Due to the special require-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
ments mentioned in paras. 4.22 and 4.25, this project component is proposed to be carried&#13;
out by the original Unit 4 turbine manufacturer under a direct negotiated contract&#13;
estimated to cost US$9 million. The Bank would finance part of this contract&#13;
retroactively (about US$6.3 million or 30% of the loan amount). International&#13;
Competitive Bidding (ICB) will be used for the procurement of goods and works for the&#13;
Telecommunication and Energy Management System and the Environmental Mitigation&#13;
measures. Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures will be used for works contracts&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$150,000, up to an aggregate of US$1.0 million and&#13;
shopping for US$0.1 million. Contracts for small quantities of training material and other&#13;
related equipment, in packages valued at less than US$25,000 each, will be procured using&#13;
local and international shopping procedures. The aggregate amount of such procurement&#13;
will not exceed US$100,000.&#13;
4.50  Consulting services will be contracted following the Bank's guidelines for such&#13;
services. Individual consultants for technical assistance and training of personnel for the&#13;
use and operation of new equipment, will also be hired following the Bank's guidelines.&#13;
4.51   The Bank's prior review of proposed invitations, award recommendations and final&#13;
contracts will be required for: (i) all contracts for works and goods procured under ICB,&#13;
and procured from single source suppliers; (ii) all contracts for consulting services with&#13;
individuals, except those with an estimated cost below US$ 25,000; and (iii) all&#13;
consultancy services contracts with firms. For all consulting services, prior review of the&#13;
terms of reference will be required. Post review by the Bank, for all contracts not subject&#13;
to prior review, will cover the relevant supporting documentation on a selective basis&#13;
during the supervision of the project. As a result of these procedures, the Bank's prior&#13;
review will cover more than 95% of the Bank's financing. For contracts to be procured&#13;
under ICB, the relevant standard bidding documents issued by the Bank will be used.&#13;
Similarly for consulting contracts with consulting firms, the Bank standard form of&#13;
contract will be used.&#13;
J. Disbursements&#13;
4.52  The proceeds of the Bank loan are expected to be disbursed over a three-year&#13;
period. The disbursement schedule was derived from the implementation plan. Proceeds of&#13;
the proposed Bank loan would be used to finance:&#13;
*  100% of foreign expenditures for purchase of equipment, materials and works&#13;
for the Life Extension of Old Harbour unit number 4;&#13;
*  100% of total foreign and local (ex-factory) expenditures and 80% of others&#13;
being procured locally for purchase of equipment, materials and works for the&#13;
telecommunications and EMS component;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
*  100% of foreign and local (ex-factory) expenditures and 80% of other items&#13;
procured locally for purchase of equipment, materials and works for&#13;
Environmental Mitigation Measures at the Old Harbour Power Station, which&#13;
include: (a) ambient sulfur dioxide monitoring; (b) wastewater treatment&#13;
plant; (c) oil spillage containment; and (d) laboratory upgrading.&#13;
* 100% of total expenditures for consulting services, technical assistance and&#13;
studies.&#13;
4.53  The Bank has agreed to retroactive financing, up to US$6.3 million, for&#13;
expenditures incurred after January 1, 1995, to cover expenses incurred for the Life&#13;
Extension of Unit 4. The Bank has granted a PPA in the amount of US$480,000 to assist&#13;
in the recruitment of consultants to help to prepare the restoration program.&#13;
4.54  A special account will be established in Bank of Jamaica with an authorized&#13;
amount of US$500,000 and an initial deposit limited to US$250,000, until disbursements&#13;
reach US$10 million.&#13;
4.55  Audits: All records relating to project expenditures will be kept by the PEU with&#13;
JPS. The audit report for the project expenditures and the special account will be&#13;
prepared, in accordance with appropriate accounting principles, by JPS external auditors.&#13;
The audit will be submitted no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
4.56  JPS will submit by August 1 of each year an updated and approved five year action&#13;
plan and its revenues and expenditures. In addition the PEU and consultants supervising&#13;
the program implementation will produce quarterly reports on the progress of each&#13;
component. JPS will regularly submit these progress reports to the Bank.&#13;
4.57  Disbursement requests would be fully documented except for payments against&#13;
contracts whose value does not exceed US$ 25,000. Claims for lesser amounts would be&#13;
subject to presentation of a statement of expenditures for which the supporting&#13;
documentation would be kept by the borrower for Bank review, on a selective basis,&#13;
during supervision. The borrower would be required to have annual audits for project&#13;
accounts. The closing date of the loan would be June 30, 1998.&#13;
K. Environmental Considerations&#13;
4.58  In March 1994, prior to the loss of Units 3 and 4, JPS contracted Fichtner (a&#13;
German consultant ) to conduct an EA for the Old Harbour Power Plant. The&#13;
recommendations of that EA included: installation of a wastewater treatment plant; oil&#13;
spillage containment; remediation of contaminated soils; installation of an on-line&#13;
condenser cleaning system; and laboratory upgrading.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
4.59  The restoration of Unit 4 will occur just before a new 72MW medium speed diesel&#13;
barge facility is to be installed at the Old Harbour Plant site. The barge facility is being&#13;
developed by Jamaica Energy Partners who have an agreement to provide power to JPS&#13;
for 20 years commencing September 1995. It will be independent of the existing plant but&#13;
will discharge cooling water into the existing cooling water canal. The EA prepared by&#13;
Fichtner did not consider the proposed barge facility. A separate EA is being prepared by&#13;
Dynalytics Corporation (a US consultant) for the developer of the barge facility.&#13;
4.60 A new EA of the Old Harbour Plant is being prepared by HTB-AGRA, an&#13;
environmental consultant. This EA will comply with the Bank's OD4.01: Environmental&#13;
Assessment. It considers the impacts from the operating Units I and 2; the Unit 3 which&#13;
has just been restored (through IDB financing); the Unit 4 which will be restored under&#13;
the proposed Bank loan; and the barge unit which will be financed by a private developer.&#13;
This EA would consider the Jamaican as well as the Bank's environmental requirements.&#13;
The Jamaican requirements include the interim environmental standards. The Bank's&#13;
environmental requirements include the 1988 Environmental Guidelines.&#13;
4.61  Based on the results of the air dispersion model used in the EA, it appears that the&#13;
ambient sulfur dioxide levels proposed by NRCA and recommended by the World Bank&#13;
may not be met without mitigatory measures. It was agreed that JPS shall prepare and&#13;
furnish to the Bank, and thereafter carry out in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, an&#13;
action plan, satisfactory to the Bank and NRCA to implement environmental mitigation&#13;
measures including, inter alia, the measures for reducing emission levels of sulfur dioxide&#13;
(SO2) at the Old Harbour Power Plant in order to comply: (i) by December 31, 1999, with&#13;
the Bank's standards set forth in the "World Bank Environmental Guidelines", published&#13;
by the Bank in September 1988; and (ii) by December 31, 2000, with NRCA's standards&#13;
as of the date of the Loan Agreement. Bank would receive the findings and&#13;
recommendations of this study, carried out under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank,&#13;
prior to effectiveness of the Loan.&#13;
4.62  Wastewater discharges from the steam plant exceeds the Bank guidelines due to&#13;
the lack of a treatment plant to handle the air preheated and boiler waste water. These&#13;
contain high levels of heavy metals which are currently discharged untreated to the cooling&#13;
water effluent. A treatment plant to handle wastewater from all units will be constructed&#13;
as part of this project. The terms of reference for a treatment plant design are provided in&#13;
Annex 4.8.&#13;
4.63  Prior activities have contaminated the site with fuel oil, in the tank farm and along&#13;
the oil transfer piping route. To prevent future contamination the tank farm will be&#13;
contained in an impermeable dike and base and the piping installed in an impermeable&#13;
trench. Remediation of contaminated areas, construction of improved secondary&#13;
containment and a chemical storage area will be undertaken as part of this project. The&#13;
terms of reference are provided in Annex 4.8.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
4.64 JPS has commenced a program of environmental stewardship through the&#13;
mitigation program underway at Hunts Bay and Rockfort Power plants. This involved&#13;
strengthening through the establishment of an organizational structure for monitoring&#13;
environmental performance. This structure will be further strengthened through training in&#13;
such areas as environmental monitoring and spill prevention, control and countermeasures.&#13;
4.65   An asbestos survey is required, followed by a management plan prior to the start&#13;
of construction activities. This will be done by JPS staff who have had asbestos training.&#13;
A PCB survey and management plan also will be undertaken by JPS staff&#13;
4.66  The laboratory of the Old Harbour Plant was destroyed during the June 1994&#13;
explosion. The laboratory will be reconstructed under this project and used for&#13;
environmental monitoring.&#13;
4.67 Considering the environmental improvements that will be achieved with this&#13;
emergency project, the proposed project has been assigned a "B" environmental rating.&#13;
L. Project Risks&#13;
4.68   The identified risks to the project include: continued government commitment to&#13;
privatization of the energy sector; JPS ability to bring down system losses and relapse in NWC&#13;
receivables; and failure to collect on the insurance payments. Under the Private Sector&#13;
Development Adjustment Loan and ESDPP projects, GOJ is proceeding with the agreed&#13;
privatization program. Progress on this program will be confirmed during the mid-term review&#13;
of ESDPP. Concerning the level of system losses, JPS has established an acceptable action&#13;
plan which will be reviewed and updated during the supervision of the proposed project. The&#13;
risk of relapse in the NWC receivables is low because it has now been financially restructured&#13;
and will be able to meet its commitments. Concerning the failure to collect on insurance&#13;
claims, JPS has retained the legal and technical services to assist in the resolution of this matter.&#13;
4.69  Three additional risks to the project may be: cost, technology, organization and&#13;
management. A large portion of the project cost estimates (about 70%) have been&#13;
established in the course of detailed negotiations with suppliers and contractors. This&#13;
reduces the risk of cost overruns to a low risk. The level of risk is reflected in the&#13;
contingency used. There is a significant risk associated with the recovery of losses from&#13;
the insurers. JPS has retained specialist advice which has assessed a 50% probability of a&#13;
long delay in recovery of funds. JPS therefore faces a potential problem with financing the&#13;
restoration of Old Harbour Unit 4 boiler. In addition to this risk, JPS also faces a risk of&#13;
cost increases as a result of planned metallurgical examinations of the turbine during the&#13;
life extension work. JPS is addressing this risk by arranging short term commercial&#13;
financing through government guarantees.&#13;
4.70   The technologies proposed for the various components are adequately tested and&#13;
the most current in use. In the case of the steam generating facilities, the technologies are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
considered proven by the manufacturers and, therefore, the risk of failure to achieve&#13;
expected performance improvements is considered low. It was suggested that JPS&#13;
negotiate suitable performance guarantees from the selected suppliers to support the&#13;
improvements offered. The gas turbine upgrades consist of technological advances made&#13;
since the original design of the machines. In order to protect JIPS's interests, the&#13;
performance predictions proposed should be supported by performance guarantees. The&#13;
environmental measures proposed are all addressable using established technology. In the&#13;
case of the telecommunication and energy management system improvements, this&#13;
component is subject to rapid technological advances and can be rapidly outdated.&#13;
However, such systems are frequently used in utility systems based on a life span which&#13;
reflects the advances of technology.&#13;
4.71  The preferred approach to dealing with Old Harbour Unit 4 is based on the&#13;
technical and schedule advantages which are part of dealing with the original supplier. The&#13;
original supplier can re-utilize the existing boiler drums which yields a schedule advantage&#13;
of about 6 months over selecting a new supplier; adding this to the estimated minimum&#13;
time of 4 months to tender and award an international competitive bid, shows a significant&#13;
advantage in favor of the negotiated contract approach. However, to complement this&#13;
schedule, it is necessary to complete the turbine-generator works in the same time frame.&#13;
There is some risk that this may not be readily achievable. The other components are&#13;
considered to have a low risk due to the flexibility of the implementation timing.&#13;
4.72  The organization and management risks to the project components are considered&#13;
to be low due to the proposed project implementation groups' experience and the use of&#13;
internationally experienced consultants and advisors.&#13;

5. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A. General&#13;
5.1   The economic analysis encompasses the following project components: the&#13;
Restoration and Life Extension of Old Harbour Unit 4 and the improvement to&#13;
telecommunications and EMS.&#13;
5.2   Two modes of economic analysis were used for economic evaluation:&#13;
* A least cost analysis which indicates that the project is the most economical&#13;
alternative for providing service; and&#13;
* A justification of the project per se, whereby the benefits are quantified by&#13;
contrasting the scenario with the project and the scenario without the project; the&#13;
difference in costs between the two scenarios provides the benefits of the project&#13;
and allows the evaluation of its internal rate of return.&#13;
5.3   The least cost analysis was performed in two stages:&#13;
* in a first-cut approximation, a static screening analysis shows the desirability of the&#13;
rehabilitation of Old Harbour Unit 4; and&#13;
*  a second stage consists of verifying that the project component is part of the&#13;
system's least cost generation expansion plan.&#13;
B. Screening Analysis&#13;
5.4   Restoration and Life Extension of Old Harbour Unit 4. The estimated total&#13;
project cost, for a July 1995 commissioning date, amounts to US$31 million. The&#13;
remaining useful life of the unit after life extension work is completed is expected to be&#13;
fifteen years. Fuel costs, in a first approximation, are expected to be on the order of&#13;
$15/bbl and the unit's heat rate is assumed to be 12,50OBtuIkWh, which corresponds to&#13;
the unit's efficiency before the explosion; the installation of a new boiler and life&#13;
extension work are expected to improve it.&#13;
5.5   In a first approximation, the cost involved in rehabilitating Unit No. 4 is compared&#13;
to the costs of Medium Speed Diesel (MSD) units, Slow Speed Diesel (SSD) units, new&#13;
Oil/Steam (OS) and Combined Cycle (CC) plants. The comparative characteristics of&#13;
these plants are summarized in the following table:&#13;

5.6     A screening analysis shows that the rehabilitation of Old Harbour unit 4 enjoys a&#13;
large advantage in investment costs. The lowest capital cost competitor in terms of $/kW,&#13;
the combined cycle units, have the disadvantage of high fuel costs due to their use of&#13;
diesel fuel. In order to compare the various types and sizes of units on a comparable&#13;
basis, the unit generating cost for each is calculated. Table 8 gives a summary of the data,&#13;
assumptions and results of the calculations. It is evident that the rehabilitation of Old&#13;
Harbour unit 4 is the preferred alternative.&#13;

5.7     The costs and operating parameters from Table 7 are applied to an assumed base&#13;
load operation for each type of unit, recognizing that base load operation would be at a&#13;
85% net capacity factor, after deducting allowances for planned and forced outages. The&#13;
next best alternative under this analysis is the new oil-fired steam unit which requires more&#13;
than double the initial capital investment. The capital cost of Old Harbour unit 4 would&#13;
have to be approximately 100% higher (i.e. over $60 million) for a new steam unit to be&#13;
more attractive.&#13;
C. Least Cost Generation Expansion Plan&#13;
5.8     The second approach verifies that the projects are included in JPS' Least Cost&#13;
Generation Expansion Program (LCGEP) . The LCGEP optimization is carried out using&#13;
the WASP III model to simulate annual investment and operating costs over the&#13;
generation planning period. The net present value of these annual expenditures is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
compared for a complete range of candidate generating plant options and expansion&#13;
sequences. The expansion sequence with the lowest net present value is chosen as the&#13;
LCGEP.&#13;
5.9   During appraisal JPS was asked to run additional generation simulations, utilizing&#13;
the latest information available on project costs, timing and fuel price forecasts. The costs&#13;
for committed and proposed privately owned power generation projects and their latest&#13;
on-line schedules were also applied to the runs.&#13;
5.10  The prices for Bunker C and diesel fuel used in the least cost analysis are based on&#13;
current world market prices of crude oil, the Bank's latest (June 1994) projections of&#13;
energy price changes and JPS' recent experience with the differentials between Bunker C&#13;
and diesel fuel delivered prices. These prices are adjusted to remove all duties, subsidies&#13;
and taxes which may be included in the actual cost of fuel. Coal prices are also based on&#13;
world market prices with an allowance for delivery to plant site and escalation according&#13;
to the Bank's projections.&#13;
5.11  Alternatives considered in the LCGEP included low and medium speed diesel&#13;
units, combined cycle units, simple cycle gas turbines as well as coal and oil fired steam&#13;
plants. A 10 MW wind farm is included in the plan on a test program basis.&#13;
5.12  The simulation runs were made for a study period of 1995 through 2013 and the&#13;
results confirm that the rehabilitation of Old Harbour Unit 4 and the repowering of the&#13;
three Gas Turbines are part of the least cost expansion sequence. This result is not&#13;
changed in the case of high or low demand forecasts or variation of the assumed discount&#13;
rate.&#13;
5.13  Since both projects involve short lead times, there are relatively few alternatives&#13;
that can be put in place within the same time frame; consequently the delay in getting low&#13;
cost base load and peaking plants commissioned has a significant impact on annual fuel&#13;
costs. This effect is in addition to the fact that both projects involve extending the&#13;
operating lives of generation resources for less than one half the cost of equivalent new&#13;
capacity (as confirmed by the screening analysis).&#13;
5.14  The least cost expansion sequence is as follows:&#13;
1994  Rehabilitation of OH Unit 3 (55MW MCR); and&#13;
60 MW Emergency Capacity (20MW Steam and 40MW GT units power&#13;
purchase agreements for 3 years)&#13;
1995  Rehabilitation and Life Extension of OH Unit 4 (68.5MW)&#13;
Repowering of GT Nos. 3, 4 &amp; 5 (63MW)&#13;
72 MW Medium Speed Diesel Private Barge&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
1996 60 MW Low Speed Diesel - Private Project&#13;
1997  10 MW Test Wind Farm&#13;
1998  60 MW Base Load&#13;
Renew 40MW Emergency Capacity contract (GT plant)&#13;
2000  60 MW Base Load&#13;
2002  3 x 80 MW Coal-Fired Station&#13;
5.15  The estimated cost of the LCGEP is US$2,082 million at 1995 price levels. The&#13;
least cost plan aims for an addition of a total net capacity of 428MW between 1994 and&#13;
2001 (excluding the coal plant) to the existing 444MW MCR after the explosion; load&#13;
growth during this period is expected to amount to around 180MW. However, during the&#13;
same period, 155MW are scheduled for retirement, including steam and gas turbine units.&#13;
Therefore the expansion program reflects the fact that many of JPS' units are close to, or&#13;
have exceeded, their economic life; given the current performance of these units there is&#13;
no avoiding the immediacy of the massive replacement requirement that now confronts the&#13;
company. Under these circumstances, the proposed expansion program reasonably&#13;
addresses the need for new capacity requirements.&#13;
5.16  As a check on the desirability of rehabilitating Old Harbour Unit 4, an alternative&#13;
was run in which Old Harbour Unit 4 is not considered as an option within the plan. The&#13;
alternative plan produced by WASP in effect replaces Old Harbour Unit 4 by a new steam&#13;
unit in 1999. The corresponding net present value cost amounts to US$2,091 million.&#13;
The rehabilitation of Old Harbour Unit 4 therefore provides a cost reduction on the order&#13;
of US$9 million against the next best plan.&#13;
D. Economic Analysis&#13;
5.17  The final mode of analysis involves a determination of the net benefits of each&#13;
identified project component and calculation of the benefit-cost ratio. The benefits&#13;
accruing to the project are considered to be represented by the additional costs incurred&#13;
over the planning period for the case in which the project is omitted from the expansion&#13;
sequence. The sum of the present values of the annual benefits is then divided by the&#13;
present value of the project investment costs to determine the benefit-cost ratio for the&#13;
project. In addition the Economic Internal Rate of Return is calculated as the discount&#13;
rate which equates the present value of the costs to the present value of the benefits for&#13;
the project.&#13;
5.18  Old Harbour Unit 4. The economic analysis of the restoration and life extension&#13;
of unit number 4 at Old Harbour Power Station assumes a total project cost, for a July&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
1995 commissioning date, of $31 million and a remaining useful service life of fifteen&#13;
years. This cost excludes price contingency and financing (IDC) costs.&#13;
5.19  For the operation of the system without OH Unit 4 the projections assume that the&#13;
capacity and energy contributed by this unit will be made up from other existing units and,&#13;
when these are not sufficient, through a decrease in reliability on the system (increase in&#13;
unserved energy). Moreover, if the unit is not rehabilitated, the insurance payment is&#13;
expected to amount to no more than the book value of the damaged components,&#13;
estimated at US$5 million, against an expected recovery on the order of US$22.5 million&#13;
if the unit is rehabilitated. The results yield a benefit-cost ratio of 1.92 for a discount rate&#13;
of 10% and a corresponding EIRR of 30.8%.&#13;
5.20  Sensitivity Results. The sensitivity of the results of the analysis to changes in&#13;
key variables was tested. The variables selected included the economic value of unserved&#13;
energy, the discount rate, the capital cost and the fuel costs. In the case of fuel costs, the&#13;
impact of adjusting the price differential between Bunker C (3% sulfur) and Diesel to&#13;
reflect the historical world market relationship is also presented. An additional sensitivity&#13;
case assumes that if Old Harbour unit number 4 is not repaired, the insurance settlement&#13;
will only amount to book value of the boiler and other damaged equipment. For purposes&#13;
of this analysis, the book value figure is taken to be US$ 5 million. The results are shown&#13;
below:&#13;

5.21  Telecommunication and Energy Management System. The EMS project&#13;
component capital cost is estimated to be $8.1 million, with implementation proposed for&#13;
October, 1997. The benefits of the project include an assumed reduction in fuel costs of&#13;
2% per year due to more efficient and effective dispatch of units as well as a reduction of&#13;
10% in unserved energy. The period of analysis is taken as fifteen years, although a&#13;
shorter period is considered in the sensitivity testing. The economic analysis compares the&#13;

6. JPS ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCES&#13;
A. Organization and Management5&#13;
6.1    Organization. Annex 6.1 shows JPS's current organizational structure. At&#13;
present the generation division (Gendiv) appears within JPS, albeit with its own financial&#13;
controller, financial administration and purchasing functions. However, this is a temporary&#13;
step towards implementing JPS' reorganization in preparation for privatization.&#13;
6.2    The background studies for the reorganization have been conducted as part of the&#13;
Operations Audit Study (Peat Marwick, 1991) and the sector restructuring studies&#13;
(Coopers &amp; Lybrand, 1992/93). The latter were conducted within the Energy Sector&#13;
Deregulation and Privatization Project (Loan 3502-JM). The restructuring of JPS is&#13;
supported by rDB. Although Coopers &amp; Lybrand's studies recommended JPS&#13;
unbundling into two companies, in charge of generation and transmission and distribution,&#13;
the Government is analyzing other alternatives.&#13;
6.3    The Office of Utility Regulation Act 1995 has been passed by the Parliament.&#13;
Consultant to assist the government to establish the Office of Utility Regulator has been&#13;
appointed. The establishment of the OUR is supported by IDB's Multi-lateral Investment&#13;
Fund (MIF) grant facility. Government has already announced its intention to privatize&#13;
JPS and invited international companies to submit applications for prequalification.&#13;
6.4   JPS has recently established an efficiency review task force to improve JPS&#13;
management and operations. Areas for improvement are: (a) organizational structure and&#13;
consolidation; (b) customer services and quality of service; (c) metering billing and&#13;
collections; d) re-engineering key processors. Recommendations from the Taskforce will&#13;
be incorporated in the corporate action plan, to be reviewed by the Bank. As a result of&#13;
recommendations of this task force, JPS has eliminated 371 positions. As a first step to&#13;
improve metering, a pilot computerized meter reading program would be implemented&#13;
before the final corporate information system is put in place (Cooper &amp; Lybrand, January&#13;
1995 study financed under Power IV Project).&#13;
6.5    Staffing. In FY94/95, JPS had a staff of 2,375 contract and permanent&#13;
employees (there are also about 525 temporaries6). Based on 370,577 customers reported&#13;
for the July/September 1994 quarter, this yields an index of 158 customers/employee (6.3&#13;
employees per 1000 accounts). This index is below the international standards which are&#13;
in excess of 160 customers/employee in reasonably managed enterprises.&#13;
Since the completion of appraisal in December 1994, JPS has undertaken a major restructuring to implement the&#13;
recommendations of the Efficiency Task Force. This restructuring will be reflected in the updated Corporate Action&#13;
Plan.&#13;
6 The term "employees" refers only to the contracted and permanent staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
6.6   JPS staffing has been increasing in the past three years: In 1992/93 there were&#13;
2,022 employees and around 237,300 customers, yielding an index of 167 customers per&#13;
employee. According to current plans, the staffing level is expected to decline to 1,993 by&#13;
FY1999/2000. With an expected number of customers by the end of the decade of around&#13;
424,400, the ratio of customers/employee would increase to 213, a good index (Annex&#13;
6.11).&#13;
6.7   Accounting, Financial Reporting and Auditing. JPS is in compliance with&#13;
requirements concerning audited financial statements. According to external auditors,&#13;
proper accounting records have been maintained, and financial statements comply with the&#13;
provisions of the Companies Act and give a true and fair view of the state of the&#13;
company's affairs.&#13;
6.8   The project entity will continue to maintain its accounting system in accordance&#13;
with sound and internationally recognized accounting principles and practices acceptable&#13;
to the Bank to provide interim financial reports and annual financial statements that reflect&#13;
the financial performance and position of the project and the project entity, from the&#13;
commencement of project execution. An auditor's opinion and reports satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank on such statements will be provided within six months of the close of the fiscal year.&#13;
The auditor's report will include a statement on the adequacy or otherwise of the&#13;
accounting system and internal controls, the reliability of statements of expenditures as a&#13;
basis for loan disbursements, and compliance with financial covenants. The foregoing&#13;
project accounting, financial reporting, and auditing arrangements should provide&#13;
adequate and timely information to the Bank for supervision of the project.&#13;
B. Financial Analysis&#13;
6.9   Introduction. JPS' financial affairs are governed by the Electricity Development&#13;
Act which allows the company to charge a rate that would cover operating costs,&#13;
including depreciation and debt service, and to set aside funds for expansions, extensions&#13;
and others alike. Under the Fourth Power Project, the World Bank financed a study to&#13;
review the tariff structure. Following this study, in December 1991, the GOJ approved a&#13;
mechanism to allow JPS to introduce an automatic adjustments clause to recover changes&#13;
in exchange rates and foreign costs (amounting to 75% of total JPS revenue&#13;
requirements). Rate calculations provide for fuel cost adjustments every six months.&#13;
These adjustments have to be approved by the MPUT. Fourth Power Project had&#13;
covenanted that JPS commission a long run marginal cost (LRMC) study to be used as a&#13;
basis for restructuring tariffs.&#13;
6.10 Following a policy decision by GOJ that Jamaica would acquire all new power&#13;
generation capacity through the private sector (BOO schemes), in 1992 the World Bank&#13;
approved the ESDPP loan. A load research program was carried out on a limited sample&#13;
and based on these results the Jamaica Power Sector Regulatory Framework and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
Privatization Study (January 1993), undertaken by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, prepared a&#13;
prelimninary LRMC. The consultants concluded that JPS' tariffs, on average, were about&#13;
15% higher than the long run marginal cost. However, it recognized that the sample base&#13;
was limited and required a further detailed and wider sample. The study recommended&#13;
that once the extensive load research program is completed, a detailed LRMC should be&#13;
commissioned and used as basis for establishing new tariff structure. The load research&#13;
program is currently underway and is expected to be completed by July, 1995. Following&#13;
the completion of this program, a detailed LRMC will be commissioned under the&#13;
proposed project (paras 3.20 and 7.1 a) and completed by March 31, 1996.&#13;
6.11  Past Financial Performance. The appraisal mission reviewed the financial&#13;
covenants agreed under the Bank's Power Four and ESDPP projects and found JPS to be&#13;
in general compliance except that JPS' receivables from the NWC and other public sector&#13;
entities are still more than 60 days billing; and JPS' RoR is below covenanted 8%. The&#13;
appraisal mission also reviewed the five year Corporate Action Plan (CAP) which was last&#13;
updated in March 1994. A negotiations JPS presented its updated preliminary Action Plan&#13;
showing the steps which are being taken to improve RoR to 8% by FY96/97 and bring&#13;
receivables from NWC and other public sector entities to below 60 days. The Ministry of&#13;
Finance and Planning (MOFP) has assumed the NWC's debt, while NWC remains current&#13;
on regular billings. MOFP has also undertaken to issue warrants to other public sector&#13;
entities and ministries which will enable them to remain current. The government has&#13;
implemented measures which have brought down the overall public sector overdue payments&#13;
from 151 days in June, 1995, to 31 days in July, 1995; comprising one day for NWC and 61&#13;
days for the rest of the government. Although, following the explosion in June 1994, JPS&#13;
had to make adjustments in the targets established in the CAP, it was able to achieve a&#13;
number of original targets. Table 11 shows a comparison of CAP's original targets and&#13;
JPS' performance during past 11 months.&#13;

6.12  Major constraints on the company's performance during FY94/95 and FY95/96&#13;
are: (a) June 1994 explosion, causing island wide power outages and as a result reducing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
sales; (b) increased fuel costs due to higher use of gas turbines, while a decision was taken&#13;
that increased fuel cost will not be passed on to the consumers and would await the&#13;
settlement of insurance claim for consequential losses; (c) delays in settlement of insurance&#13;
claims; (d) increase in 0 &amp; M expenses to restore the reliability of generation system; and&#13;
(e) initial recommendations of an independent Tariff Review Committee that JPS should&#13;
review and reduce its operating costs and improve the financial performance rather than&#13;
receive an outright increase in its base tariffs.&#13;
6.13  Following a review of its financial and operating position, JPS had set up an&#13;
Efficiency Review Taskforce (ERT) to examine cost containment measures, organizational&#13;
structure, number of employees and other opportunities to improve efficiency. The&#13;
Taskforce completed its work in April 1995. Following this, JPS is implementing its&#13;
recommendations and will update the CAP accordingly. In the meanwhile, JPS has&#13;
prepared a monitorable summary CAP for the period 1995-2000. The key objectives of&#13;
this plan are: (a) restore the lost generation capacity to normal conditions by August&#13;
1995; (b) improve system reliability by improving the energy control system and&#13;
reinforcing the transmission network to reduce the likelihood of future recurrence of&#13;
generating plant incidents; (c) continue with the restructuring of the company for&#13;
privatization; (d) maintain tariffs levels to obtain a 8% RoR on average revalued fixed&#13;
assets; (e) complete the long run marginal cost study based on the results of the load&#13;
research program and develop special tariff for select groups such as National Water&#13;
Commission; (f) review corporate organization and staffing aimed at cost containment&#13;
and management efficiency and establish targets to be achieved under the updated CAP to&#13;
be completed by August 30, 1995; (g) conduct a pilot computerized meter reading&#13;
program; (h) develop and implement the financial medium and long range planning&#13;
component in the Integrated Resource Planning Model; (i) conduct benchmark Customer&#13;
Satisfaction Survey once every two years; () initiate environmental mitigation plans and&#13;
develop relevant targets to be incorporated in the CAP; (k) implement the demand side&#13;
management programs; and (1) continue to reap the benefits of the fuel procurement&#13;
strategies which have recently been implemented&#13;

6.19   Overall JPS' financial position has been heavily influenced by the effects of&#13;
exchange rate movements of the Jamaican dollar and also the impact of local and foreign&#13;
inflation. Local inflation moved from 105% in 1991/92 to an estimated out turn of some&#13;
24.9% in 1994/95. The Jamaican dollar moved from J$ 7.9 per US$ in FY91 to J$ 33.3&#13;
per US$ in FY95, thereby resulting in a sharp increase in the net fixed asset base.&#13;
Working capital representing the excess of current assets over current liabilities also grew&#13;
during this period with current ratio fluctuating between 1 .1 and 1.9. During this period&#13;
JPS was able to fund its operations substantially from internal sources thereby limiting its&#13;
need to resort to long-term borrowings. With expected stabilization in the J$,&#13;
improvements in the operational efficiency and the implementation of its Corporate Action&#13;
Plan 1995/2000, JPS is expected to improve its financial position in line with projections&#13;
presented in Annex 6.2 to 6.4.&#13;
6.20   Capital Expenditure. JPS' capital expenditure program for FY95 - FY99&#13;
assumes: (a) all future generation investments, except hydroelectric power plants, would&#13;
be undertaken by the private sector; and (b) the expansion and improvement of the&#13;
transmission and distribution systems as well as rehabilitation of existing plants and&#13;
implementation of ongoing projects will be carried out by JPS. The program which is&#13;
based on projected exchange rates (Annex 6.2) is within the overall public sector&#13;
investment program (PSIP) which has been submitted to MPUT and the Ministry of&#13;
Finance, and forms the part of PSIP to be agreed between GOJ and IMF for FY96. The&#13;
investment program for the five years is estimated at J$ 13.8 billion or US$ 392 million in&#13;
constant terms and J$ 14.6 billion (US$ 416 million) in nominal terms. Of this, foreign&#13;
component is about 68%. The investment program is detailed in Annex 6.10 and&#13;
summarized in Table 15 below.&#13;

6.26  The above financial projections are based on the set of assumptions contained in&#13;
Annex 6.13 and 6.14. The overriding aspect of these projections is the contribution of&#13;
purchased power which increases from 5% in FY95 to 16% in FY96 and 66% in FY2000.&#13;
An application has been made to the government to have all purchased power cost&#13;
included in the fuel charge which would now be described as fuel and purchased power&#13;
cost and would be directly passed on to the consumer. The average price of the fuel is&#13;
based on the weighted mix of fuels, adjusted in line with projected increase in international&#13;
price of fuels during the period. For FY95/96 an increase of 13.4% in base tariffs is&#13;
assumed to be effective from the beginning of the year. However, it is likely that the tariff&#13;
increase will only be effective from the middle of the fiscal year. If this should occur, the&#13;
operating revenues for FY95/96 would fall by about 3% and the rate of return would be&#13;
about 4.2% instead of 6% shown above.7 Total operating revenues also include J$323&#13;
milion excess funds recovered from consumers in previous years as a result of the&#13;
application of the fuel adjustment clause. This is expected to partially compensate for the&#13;
delay in tariff adjustment.&#13;
6.27  Funding. Table 19 sets out the projected funding plan for JPS' investment&#13;
program over the period FY95-FY2000.&#13;
7As a consequence of a delay in effecting an 8.8% tariff increase for FY95/96, the operating margin&#13;
would also drop to 7.8% from 10.9%; and return on equity will be about 2% instead of 2.8%, as shown in&#13;
Annex 6-12.&#13;

6.28  The above financing plan shows the high level of capital expenditure to be&#13;
undertaken by JPS over the next five years will be funded increasingly from internal&#13;
resources after meeting debt service obligations and working capital requirements. New&#13;
borrowings are linked directly with foreign exchange requirements and the level of capital&#13;
expenditures funded internally ranges between 45% in FY97 to 86% in FY98.&#13;
6.29  Financial Position. Detailed projected balance sheets, for the years FY96-&#13;

6.30  The most significant features of the projected balance sheets are the reduction in&#13;
debt/equity ratios from 0.4 in FY96 to 0.3 in FY2000 and growth in liquidity over the&#13;
projection period. The reduction is driven by both enhanced profitability and additions to&#13;
capital reserve arising from fixed assets revaluation. The above projections assume that&#13;
GOJ would continue to allow JPS to automatically adjust its tariffs to pass all fuel and&#13;
purchased power cost to the consumer, thus maintaining the level of unit base tariffs at&#13;
present level in US dollar terms. A full set of key financial indicators is shown in Annex&#13;
6.11 and 6.12.&#13;

JAMAICA PUBLIC SERVICE&#13;
Generation Recovery And Improvement Project Description&#13;
Background&#13;
On June 3rd, 1994 the Jamaica Public Service Company Ltd. (JPS) suffered a significant&#13;
reduction to its power generating capacity due to an explosion and fire at the Old Harbour Power&#13;
Station. The explosion resulted in a complete loss of the unit number 4 boiler and associated&#13;
auxiliaries and substantial damage to the boiler of unit number 3. Further, a substantial part of the&#13;
unit number 4 electrical equipment and cabling were burned and neighbouring buildings were&#13;
destroyed or severely damaged. The incident has resulted in a total reduction of 124 MW from&#13;
the total available capacity of 569 MW prior to the incident.&#13;
As a result of the above JPS reserve margin has dropped from 49% down to 17% causing&#13;
severe system unreliability. JPS is presently taking steps to restore its generating capacity back to&#13;
an acceptable level. Among several steps to be taken is the repair and rehabilitation of the Unit&#13;
number 3 boiler and the procurement and installation of a replacement boiler to be used with the&#13;
existing 68 MW turbine set at the Old Harbour Power Station Unit Number 4. In addition, this&#13;
project will include the replacement of all electric equipment, cabling, instrumentation and switch&#13;
gear, control building, chemical laboratory and stores buildings which were damaged during the&#13;
explosion. JPS will also be pursuing a life extension programme for the Unit number 4 turbine&#13;
generator set and associated auxiliary systems to enable the unit to be operable for a further 20 to&#13;
30 years. Unit number 3 at the Old Harbour Power Station is scheduled to be back in operation&#13;
by February 1995 and the restoration programme is expected to be completed in the third quarter&#13;
of 1995.&#13;
In addition to the recovery and life extension programs on the Old Harbour Power Station&#13;
following the incident, a generation improvement programme will be carried out to improve the&#13;
efficiency and availability of the power production capacity operated by JPS. The generation&#13;
improvements programme is expected to be completed by end of 1996.&#13;
The Project Components&#13;
The proposed Project consists of eight major components as follows:&#13;
*  Restoration of Old Harbour Unit Number 3;&#13;
*  Restoration of Old Harbour Unit Number 4;&#13;
*  Life Extension of Old Harbour Unit Number 4;&#13;
*  Gas Turbines 3, 4 and 5 Upgrade;&#13;
*  Telecommunication and Energy Management Systems Improvement;&#13;
*  Transmission and Substations Reinforcements&#13;
*  Environmental Mitigation Measures at the Old Harbour Power Station and&#13;
Other Sites;&#13;
&#13;

Consultancy Services; and Technical Assistance.&#13;
Restoration of Old Harbour Unit number 3&#13;
This project component comprises repair of the damage to OH unit number 3 boiler&#13;
caused by the incident. In addition, this component includes rehabilitation work on unit number 3&#13;
boiler and turbine. The materials being used for the rehabilitation of unit number 3 were originally&#13;
provided as part of a contract which JPS had in-place for a planned rehabilitation of unit number 4&#13;
but the June explosion of Unit number 4 and its subsequent replacement enabled JPS to utilise the&#13;
materials to expedite the repair of unit number 3. In addition, materials on-site and planned for&#13;
rehabilitation work on unit number 4, enabled JPS to redirect the rehabilitation work to unit&#13;
number 3.&#13;
Restoration of Old Harbour Unit Number 4&#13;
This project component will include works and equipment deliveries to be provided for a&#13;
full restoration of the Unit number 4 steam generating facilities including the control building,&#13;
chemical laboratory and stores destroyed by the explosion on June 3, 1994.&#13;
The restoration of Unit number 4 steam generating facilities will include the following&#13;
scope of supply:&#13;
*  Site clearance;&#13;
*  Delivery and installation of a complete new boiler incl. fans, air pre-heaters and&#13;
flue gas ducts;&#13;
* Delivery and installation of fuel handling and burning systems;&#13;
e  Replacement of the main steam, boiler feedwater and auxiliary piping systems;&#13;
Delivery and installation of new instrumentation and control systems to the&#13;
latest standards;&#13;
*  Delivery and installation of complete new electrical equipment and cabling&#13;
systems as required for the restoration of the unit;&#13;
*  Repair of the stack;&#13;
*  Replacement of auxiliary systems as required following the explosion and fire;&#13;
Reconstruction of the plant stores building and services;&#13;
* Reconstruction of the plant chemical laboratory and resupply of laboratory&#13;
equipment;&#13;
*  Replacement of turbine hall crane rail beam; and&#13;
* Miscellaneous other systems and services replacement.&#13;
An examination of the existing drums has been conducted by the original boiler supplier;&#13;
the report covering the extent of this work and the methodology used was not available for review&#13;
by the mission. Visual examination of the drums showed some tube plate erosion assumed to be a&#13;
result of tube leaks and some surface damage assumed to be a result of the incident; the areas seen&#13;
are considered repairable. The original boiler supplier has proposed to restore the drums to a state&#13;
of full compliance with the ASME Boiler Code for re-use in the replacement boiler. This approach&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
avoids the delays associated with delivery of new drums which would be necessary if another&#13;
boiler supplier were to be involved.&#13;
Life Extension of OH Unit Number 4&#13;
This project component includes works and deliverables to be provided for the restoration&#13;
and life extension program for the unit number 4 turbine-generating facilities. Such proposed&#13;
works and deliverables are mainly related to equipment and systems not renewed and/or replaced&#13;
as a consequence of the explosion.&#13;
In addition to the proposed rebuild of unit number 4, a life extension program of the unit&#13;
number 4 steam turbine generating facilities is proposed. The program comprises the following&#13;
items:&#13;
* Life extension of the turbine and generator set. A proposal for this work was submit-&#13;
ted on September 30th, 1994 by the turbine manufacturer GE Intemational Power&#13;
Systems. This proposal includes the items considered necessary by GE, the original&#13;
supplier, for the life extension;&#13;
* Overhaul and upgrade of turbine auxiliary systems;&#13;
* Repair of steam air ejectors;&#13;
* Modifications to the cooling water piping and valve installations;&#13;
* Replacement of the condenser water boxes;&#13;
* Installation of duplex filters and a ball tube cleaning system in the cooling water&#13;
system; and&#13;
* Installation of a cathodic protection system for the condenser and CW cooling water&#13;
screen systems.&#13;
Gas Turbines 3, 4 and 5 Upgrade&#13;
This project component comprises restoration and life extension of the three Frame 5&#13;
General Electric gas turbines, identified as Hunts Bay Units 4, 5 and Bogue Unit 3, each of which&#13;
has a name plate output of 22.8 MW and a continuous maximum output of 20 MW. These gas&#13;
turbines are configured as simple cycle units with a heat rates as shown below. The units were&#13;
installed 1973 and 1974 and were scheduled to be decommissioned in 1997 and 1998.&#13;
The units have been operated as peak load capacity with a total operating hours of&#13;
approx. 36000 to 40000 for the Hunts Bay units and 45000 hours for the unit at Bogue. As a&#13;
result of the loss of generating capacity at Old Harbour, the units have been operated at higher&#13;
load factors.&#13;
The objective of the proposed project component is to replace existing parts of the gas&#13;
turbines with new and modem equipment in order to improve the unit efficiency, to increase the&#13;
reliability and extend the technical life time at least 10 years. Upgrade and life extension programs&#13;
on existing plant are increasingly a common practice in the utility industry due to the capital cost&#13;
of new plant and the problems associated with siting of new facilities. Upgrading of existing plant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
also permits utilities to incorporate the benefits of the ongoing research and development work&#13;
undertaken by the equipment manufacturer.&#13;
In order to ensure the success of such programs, it is common practice in the industry to&#13;
negotiate a contract with the original designer/manufacturer of the plant because of the risk of&#13;
failure to meet expectations involved with trying to incorporate components from other suppliers.&#13;
The replacement program for existing parts with advanced technology components will include&#13;
items such as:&#13;
* The supply and installation of a Hot Gas Path Advanced Technology package as&#13;
developed by the original plant designer/manufacturer; and&#13;
* The provision of a modernisation package to include:&#13;
- new control system using microprocessor based technology,&#13;
- new compressor blades, vanes and bleed valves,&#13;
- new fuel system,&#13;
- modified bearing design,&#13;
- extended exhaust thermocouple.&#13;
The anticipated performance improvements are as follows:&#13;
Heat Rate (BTU/kWh)         Output (kW)&#13;
Power Plant          Before         After        Before   After&#13;
Bogue Unit 3          16,400         15,621      20,000   21,064&#13;
Hunts' Bay Unit 4     17,460         15,621      20,000   21,064&#13;
Hunts' Bay Unit 5     15,994         15,621      20,000   21,064&#13;
Transmission and Substations Reinforcements&#13;
To accommodate the scheduled addition of 72MW of new generating capacity at Old Harbour&#13;
(WartsilalJamaica Energy Partners barge), against the background of the restoration of units 3 and 4, it&#13;
is necessaiy to provide reinforcements to the transmission system to assure the interconnection of this&#13;
new facility and the reliable transmission of power from Old Harbour. The proposed reinforcements&#13;
consist of:&#13;
* Construction of 32km of 138kV lines between Pamassus and Spur Tree with attendant&#13;
substation facilities for interconnection;&#13;
* Construction of 16km of 138kV lines between Spur Tree and Kendal with attendant&#13;
substation facilities; and&#13;
* Substation expansion to accommodate the Wartsila/JEP 72MW barge&#13;

Telecommunication and Energy Management System Improvement&#13;
Existing Energy Management System (EMS). The existing EMS was supplied by Harris&#13;
Corporation in 1985 using early 1980's technology. The System is old and nearing the end of its useful&#13;
life. It can not meet JPS current and near future needs and operational requirements. The System has&#13;
several deficiencies some of which include: outdated computer equipment (thus, lack of vendor&#13;
support), essential application software not operational, inconsistent and inaccurate alarms, outdated&#13;
user interface, no capability to interface with other departments, and cumbersome maintenance support&#13;
tools. In addition, due to turnover in staff, the new programming staff have received little formal&#13;
training on the computer system - some training is no longer offered by the supplier. The manuals are&#13;
ineffective and very cumbersome to use. These deficiencies cannot be overcome cost effectively.&#13;
Existing Telecommunication System (TCS). The transmission network is comprised of&#13;
analogue microwave radio which spans five major repeater stations originating and terminating at&#13;
Catherine's Peak repeater station. Spur and radial links in conjunction with power line carrier&#13;
equipment complete the connections to the substations and administrative offices. The frequency&#13;
bands used are 960 Mhz and 1.5 GHz, with a maximum equipped capacity of 72 channels. The&#13;
equipment is over 10 years old.&#13;
The existing system has various problems, among them we can mention the following:&#13;
* High Fault Rates&#13;
*  Obsolete Equipment&#13;
* Unreliable/Inadequate PLC Equipment&#13;
*  Insecure Network Arrangement&#13;
*  Insufficient Standby Radio Links&#13;
*  Low Channel Capacity&#13;
*  No Expansion Capability&#13;
*  Lack of Communication Control Facility&#13;
*  Dependence on Public Telecommunications Company&#13;
Proposed Expansion of the EM System. The acquisition of a modern Energy Management&#13;
System base on an open system architecture is recommended. The functions envisioned for the JPS&#13;
Energy Management System include: SCADA, Generation Control, Power System Network&#13;
Security Analysis, Historical Information System, Energy Accounting, Generation Scheduling, Load&#13;
Shedding, Operator Training Simulator, Full Graphics User Interface, and the necessary support&#13;
functions. Each function above consists of several application programs.&#13;
The procurement of this system can help JPS achieve higher operational efficiency and realize&#13;
improved system reliability and substantial fuel savings immediately. In addition, in light of potential&#13;
reform and restructuring of the Power Industry within Jamaica, the new EMS as envisioned above, will&#13;
place JPS Systems Control in an excellent position to serve the needs of the reformed industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
Proposed New TC System. It is proposed to implement, on a supply and supervision of&#13;
installation basis, a digital network consisting of a microwave backbone radio, fractional rate UHF&#13;
digital radios and the necessary multiplex and auxiliary equipment.&#13;
This new telecommunication system has as the primary objective, the provision of&#13;
* High quality transmission channels&#13;
* High bandwidth capacity&#13;
* High service reliability&#13;
* New diversified network&#13;
*  A management control center&#13;
Environmental Mitigation Measures&#13;
This component of the project comprises the implementation of measures recommended in this&#13;
and previous reports. These measures include:&#13;
* provision of a waste water treatment plant at Old Harbour Power Station&#13;
i oil spillage containment measures&#13;
remediation of contaminated soils&#13;
- redirection of regeneration effluent from the water treatment plant&#13;
3 laboratory upgrading&#13;
Other measures recommended in this and previous environmental reports (such as improved&#13;
boiler controls and stack emissions monitoring and on-line condenser tube cleaning) are included in the&#13;
project component for Old Harbour unit number 4. A detailed discussion of the environmental issues is&#13;
presented in Annex 4.3.&#13;

Environmental Issues and Mitigation Action Plan&#13;
Legal, Institutional, and Policy Framework&#13;
In June of 1991, following the passage of enabling legislation, the GOJ established the&#13;
National Resource Conservation Authority (NRCA) as the principle agency responsible for the&#13;
effective management of the environment. Its functions cover management and policy aspects&#13;
relating to wildlife, watersheds, coastal zone protection, national parks, including survey and&#13;
investigative work. Of particular relevance to the energy sector, NRCA has the responsibility to:&#13;
-  require EIA's;&#13;
-  order the cessation of pollution;&#13;
-  require develop, implement, and monitor environmental protection programs;&#13;
*  formulate standards and codes of practice including those relating to emissions and&#13;
effluents;&#13;
*  investigate the effect on the environment of polluting activities and take appropriate&#13;
action;&#13;
*  commission studies and promote relevant research;&#13;
*  introduce training programs;&#13;
*  do anything which in the opinion of NRCA is necessary to perform its functions; and&#13;
* industries to monitor and report pollutant discharges; and restore polluted areas to&#13;
there original condition.&#13;
The NRCA will be developing these activities in conjunction with the various sector&#13;
agencies; and an energy / environmental steering committee has been formed to look at the broad&#13;
range of environmental issues facing the energy sector. The energy sector plans are to include:&#13;
*  a mandatory EIA for new energy projects;&#13;
*  cleaning up existing pollution sources, priorities being JPS and the Petrojam refinery;&#13;
*  pollution abatement by energy conservation and efficiency improvement;&#13;
*  strengthening NRCA to fulfill its mandate;&#13;
*  establishing baseline data for air quality and forestry resources;&#13;
*  identifying standards for zones such as Kingston, tourist areas etc.&#13;
NGO's have been formed and are active in environmental issues. The University of West&#13;
Indies are doing environmental research and the Ministry of Health has been doing air quality&#13;
monitoring studies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
Environmental Issues&#13;
During the preparation of the Energy Sector Deregulation and Privatization (ESDP,&#13;
Loan 3502-JM) environmental impact assessments (EIA)'s were completed for new generation&#13;
capacity being added at Hunt's Bay and Rockfort. Based on the recommendations of these&#13;
studies, JPS established a mitigation action plan for Hunt's Bay. The action plan included&#13;
measures to control and monitor: SO2 emissions; chemical waste and hazardous waste&#13;
management; site remediation and liquid effluent monitoring; and an air monitoring program. JPS&#13;
have been assisted in the implementation by Geomatrix Inc. (US consultant ) and; by Conrad&#13;
Douglas &amp; Associates (Jamaican) and Kolbusch and Partners Ltd. (Jamaican). The mitigation&#13;
requirements of that program are expected to be complete by mid 1995.&#13;
Recently JPS contracted with Fichtner (a German consultant ) to complete an EIA for the&#13;
Old Harbour power plant and this was completed in March 1994, prior to the loss of Unit 4. The&#13;
recommendations of that report included: a waste water treatment plant; oil spillage containment;&#13;
remediation of contaminated soils; on-line condenser cleaning; improved boiler instrumentation&#13;
and controls; use of the existing neutralization plant for regeneration wastes from the&#13;
demineralization plant; and laboratory upgrading.&#13;
The restoration of OH Unit 4 will occur at the same time that a new 72MW medium speed&#13;
diesel barge facility is to be installed at the Old Harbour Plant. The barge facility is being&#13;
developed by Jamaica Energy Partners who have an agreement to provide power to JPS for 20&#13;
years commencing September 1995. It will be independent of the existing plant but will discharge&#13;
cooling water into the existing cooling water canal. The EIA of the existing steam plant,&#13;
previously completed for JPS by Fichtner did not consider the barge facility. A separate EIA is&#13;
being prepared by Dynalytics Corporation (a US consultant) for the developer of the barge&#13;
facility but this also does not consider the combined impacts of the existing plant. The NRCA&#13;
agrees with WB that the EIA for the barge should include impacts from the existing power plant.&#13;
The barge facility will discharge cooling water to the existing condenser cooling canal.&#13;
The impacts of the combined thermal plume will be modeled as part of the EIA for the barge.&#13;
The barge will require dredging of an estimated 200,000 cubic meters of material to provide a&#13;
basin of sufficient depth adjacent to the plant. The dredged materials will be transported to a&#13;
designated dump site at sea. No dredging will be done in the area of the coral reefs. Fuel will be&#13;
delivered via an undersea pipeline from an offshore tanker mooring; to prevent impacts from spills&#13;
a contingency plan will be required.&#13;
The existing steam plant at Old Harbour exceeds the WB and NRCA guidelines for&#13;
ambient levels of sulphur dioxide due to the low stack heights and the fuel being used. The&#13;
addition of control measures, such as increased stack height, to the new unit 4 boiler will not&#13;
bring the plant into compliance. With unit 4 shut down, and the other three units operating, the&#13;
maximum SO2 levels are approximately 500% and 180% of the WB and NRCA ambient (24 hour)&#13;
guidelines respectively. The point of maximum impact is approximately 500m west of the station,&#13;
an area of low habitation. The incremental increase in sulphur dioxide from the barge facility is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
marginal. The retirement of Units 1 and 2 in 1998/9 will greatly improve conditions, but the&#13;
guidelines will still be exceeded on occasion, Preliminary information provided on the barge&#13;
shows that it will increase NO, levels above WB guidelines. The combined emissions from the&#13;
barge and existing plant meet ambient levels for particulate matter. JPS has agreed to develop an&#13;
acceptable Mitigation plan by October 31, 1995, to comply with the World Bank standards by&#13;
1999 and NRCA standards by 2000.&#13;
Waste water discharges from the steam plant also exceed WB guidelines due to the lack&#13;
of a treatment plant to handle the air preheater and boiler wash waters. These contain high levels&#13;
of heavy metals which are currently discharged untreated to the Caribbean Sea via the cooling&#13;
water effluent .&#13;
Prior activities at Old Harbour have contaminated the site with fuel oil, in the tank farm&#13;
and along the piping route. The oil piping is not contained in trenching along its full route. To&#13;
prevent future contamination the tank farm should be contained in an impermeable dyke and the&#13;
oil transfer piping installed in an impermeable trench. Contarninated soils at Hunts Bay were&#13;
removed and burned in a cement kiln. A secure storage area is required for chemicals and&#13;
hazardous wastes. This should include a curbed concrete pad, a rain canopy and fencing.&#13;
JPS has commenced a program of environmental stewardship through the mitigation&#13;
program underway at Hunts Bay and Rockfort. This requires strengthening through the&#13;
establishment of an organizational structure for monitoring environmental performance. This can&#13;
be achieved using existing staff resources who have been trained in environmental controls.&#13;
An asbestos survey is urgently required, followed by a management plan prior to the start&#13;
of construction activities on Unit 4. JPS staff can complete this, as approximately 30 of them&#13;
have had asbestos training. A PCB survey and management plan is also required; JPS are&#13;
consolidating waste PCB's and negotiating shipment to a destruction facility in France.&#13;
Environmental Action Plans&#13;
Air emissions: The restoration of Unit 4 will not increase air emissions above those&#13;
which existed prior to the loss of the boiler. Improvements in modem controls will have a&#13;
positive effect on the emissions from Unit 4. The proposed condenser cleaning system will reduce&#13;
fuel consumption thereby reducing overall emissions. The high ambient S02 levels will be&#13;
reduced with the planned retirement of unit 1 in 1998 and Unit 2 in 1999. The barge developer is&#13;
researching the ratio of NO2 to NO, in the exhaust gas.&#13;
Barge facility: As part of the EIA requirement for the barge, the developer will prepare&#13;
a plan to reduce the impacts from dredging; complete a study of the effects of the heated water&#13;
discharge from the combined plant; and prepare a spill contingency plan.&#13;
Waste water effluents: The air preheater wash and boiler wash waters will be treated by&#13;
a waste water treatment plant. Terms of reference have been prepared to retain a consultant for&#13;
the design and specification of this facility to be financed under the proposed project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
Site contamination: The contaminated areas of the Old Harbour site will be remediated.&#13;
Terms of reference have been prepared to retain a consultant for the site investigation and&#13;
specification of the cleanup, to be financed under the proposed project.&#13;
Spill containment: Spill containment will be upgraded including tank bunds, installation&#13;
of a secure chemical storage area; and extension of the oil transfer piping trenches. Terms of&#13;
reference have been prepared to retain a consultant to investigate conduct the survey and prepare&#13;
specifications for construction as part of this project.&#13;
Asbestos: JPS will conduct an asbestos survey and prepare an implement a management&#13;
plan using trained staff.&#13;
PCB's: JPS will conduct a PCB survey and prepare an implement a management plan&#13;
using trained staff.&#13;
Environmental monitoring: JPS will monitor the environmental performance of the&#13;
plant. This will include waste water effluents, spills, contingency response, and waste chemical&#13;
management. In addition JPS will continue to do annual inspections of the under sea oil transfer&#13;
pipeline from Esquivel.&#13;
Laboratory: JPS are reconstructing the laboratory which was lost in the explosion.&#13;
Mitigation plans&#13;
The EIA's have identified three projects that can improve the environmental conditions at Old&#13;
Harbour Power Plant:&#13;
* a waste water treatment plant for the treatment of air preheater wash and boiler wash&#13;
waters;&#13;
* remediation of petroleum contaminated soils and;&#13;
* the installation of improved spill containment measures.&#13;
Terms of reference were prepared for retaining a consultant to investigate and prepare&#13;
designs and specifications for construction (see Annex A 4.8). In addition a study, carried out&#13;
under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, on alternatives to comply with the standards for&#13;
emission levels of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and development of mitigation measures to achieve&#13;
compliance with: (i) by December 31, 1999, with the Bank Standards; and (ii) by December 31,&#13;
2000, with NRCA's standards, will be submitted to the Bank as a condition of effectiveness.&#13;

Consultancy Services for Environmental Mitigation&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
Introduction&#13;
On June 3, 1994 an explosion occurred at the Old Harbour power plant in Jamaica which&#13;
destroyed the unit 4 boiler and damaged unit 3. As part of a program to restore the power station&#13;
capacity at the Old Harbour power plant, the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS) requires the&#13;
services of a qualified environmental consulting firm to assist in projects involving the upgrading&#13;
of environmental controls. The projects will include studies to identify the extent of the problems,&#13;
the design of control measures and assistance with the implementation.&#13;
This Terms of Reference gives the background, scope of services, and description of&#13;
deliverables required from this project:&#13;
Task 1:  Waste water pollution control.&#13;
Task 2:  Investigation and design of a site remediation program.&#13;
Task 3:  Investigation and design of spill containment measures.&#13;
TASK 1: Waste Water Pollution Control&#13;
Background. The power station requires a waste water treatment plant to handle the air&#13;
preheater wash water which is acidic in nature and contains high levels of dissolved metals and&#13;
ash deposits. The treatment plant must also be capable of handling boiler wash water. The treated&#13;
effluent must meet World Bank guidelines for thermal power plants and the Jamaican guidelines&#13;
for waste water discharges as administered by the National Resource Conservation Authority&#13;
(NRCA). Included in the scope of work is the design of a collection system to direct the wastes&#13;
from each of the four boilers to the proposed central treatment facility and a treated effluent&#13;
sewer.&#13;
Scope of work. The consultant will conduct a thorough survey of the power plant to&#13;
determine the flows and characteristics of each of the waste water sources to be treated. This&#13;
should include the collection of samples over the course of at least one air preheater wash cycle.&#13;
Samples should be analyzed and bench tests done to determine the appropriate treatment method.&#13;
A survey should also be conducted to provide the basis of design for a collection system&#13;
for the wastes from each boiler to the treatment plant and a discharge sewer to the cooling water&#13;
canal. As part of this field survey the consultant should liaise with JPS for agreement on the&#13;
location of the treatment plant. At least two alternative methods of treatment should be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
considered for conceptual design. These will include methods of sludge handling and disposal&#13;
options. The consultant will provide JPS with a report describing the treatment alternatives and&#13;
recommend the preferred system. The estimated capital and operating cost of each alternative, the&#13;
process flow diagrams and equipment lists will be included in the report. The consultant will be&#13;
required to make a presentation of the report to JPS.&#13;
Following a review of the report and agreement by JPS on the preferred alternative the&#13;
consultant will complete the technical specifications for the supply and construction of the&#13;
treatment plant. The consultant will provide support to JPS such as design review during the&#13;
implementation phase.&#13;
TASK 2: Investigation and design of a site remediation program&#13;
The power station site has been contaminated by petroleum products. These areas can be&#13;
observed within the tank farm and along the oil pipeline corridor. This contamination requires&#13;
remediation prior to installing an impermeable spill containment system.&#13;
Scope of work. The consultant will conduct a field investigation to determine the extent&#13;
of contamination and prepare remedial plans for the decontamination of soil at the plant. If&#13;
groundwater impacts are found the remedial plan will assess the need for treatment.&#13;
The consultant will first prepare a work plan describing the conditions, a statement of&#13;
objectives and plans for the field investigations. The work plan will include a list of analyses to be&#13;
performed, a description of the sampling, sample preservation, and analytical methods required.&#13;
The work plan will include a health and safety protocol to be followed by the field team.&#13;
The consultant will obtain representative samples of soil water and sediments for physical&#13;
examination and chemical analyses necessary to fully characterize the extent of contamination.&#13;
Sampling and analyses will be performed using methods outlined in the work plan by trained&#13;
personnel.&#13;
The consultant, in cooperation with JPS will develop the clean up criteria, compatible with&#13;
international standards for the contaminated areas of the site. The consultant will then identify&#13;
and screen remedial technologies based on the following criteria:&#13;
*  Effectiveness: How effective is the selected technology in reducing the pollutant&#13;
concentrations to the target levels? Has the technology been commercially proven at&#13;
other similar sites? Are there any adverse environmental impacts associated with the&#13;
technology?&#13;
*  Implementation: Is the remedial technology easily implementable in Jamaica?&#13;
*  Costs: Is the technology relatively inexpensive?&#13;
For the contaminated areas the consultant will prepare a remedial plan. The plan will&#13;
include remedial objectives, identification and screening of remedial technologies and details of&#13;
the selected mode of clean up. It will include the description, designs environmental impacts,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -&#13;
monitoring requirements, implementation and disposal. Supporting information such as bases for&#13;
cost estimates, preliminary equipment lists and technical information will be appended as&#13;
appropriate. Previously petroleum contaminated soil has been excavated and incinerated in a local&#13;
cement kiln.&#13;
The consultant will provide technical specifications for the remediation to JPS for review&#13;
and comment. these will be finalized after receipt of comments.&#13;
The consultant will provide technical support to JPS during the implementation phase.&#13;
TASK 3: Investigation and design of spill containment measures&#13;
Background. A survey of the plant revealed a need to provide or upgrade existing spill&#13;
containment facilities. The areas of greatest significance are: the bulk fuel tank storage area&#13;
which requires impermeable containment; the oil pipeline corridor which has only partial&#13;
containment; and the need for a secure chemical drum storage area.&#13;
Scope of work. The consultant will conduct a thorough survey of the site to evaluate the&#13;
operating practices which may contribute to spills and the adequacy of the existing spill&#13;
containment structures. Some of the current structures are earthen dykes which have been&#13;
contaminated by petroleum spills. The extent of the survey will not be limited to those areas&#13;
indicated above, but will be more comprehensive. Based on the survey, the consultant will&#13;
identify specific areas where spills occur and prescribe measures for preventing and controlling the&#13;
discharges. These measures may include improvements of existing designs (e.g. paving of earthen&#13;
area with concrete), new designs (e.g. dykes) or changes in operating procedures (e.g. improved&#13;
drum and chemical handling methods). The consultant will provide an estimate of cost with each&#13;
recommended control measure.&#13;
For new or improved containment the consultant will provide designs and specifications&#13;
for construction which are compatible with international standards.&#13;
The consultant will provide a report of findings with recommendations describing spill&#13;
prevention and containment. The report will be presented to JPS.&#13;
The consultant will provide JPS with support during the implementation phase.&#13;
Deliverables&#13;
The consultant will prepare and submit the following deliverable to JPS to cover all three&#13;
tasks as described above. Each deliverable will be finalized by the consultant after review and&#13;
comment by JPS. The consultant will prepare:&#13;
A detailed work plan for the site remediation;&#13;
A report for all three tasks including: (i) the waste water treatment plant alternatives&#13;
and recommended treatment option; (ii) the remedial action plan for cleaning up the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
petroleum contaminated soil, including alternative technologies considered, all&#13;
analytical results, borehole and test pit logs, drawings and the work plan; and (iii) the&#13;
findings and recommendations of the investigation and design of spill containment&#13;
measures;&#13;
*  Technical specifications for the supply and construction of the treatment plant;&#13;
*  Technical specifications for remediating the site; and&#13;
*  Technical specifications for the construction of spill containment.&#13;
Scbedule&#13;
The schedule for Tasks 1 to 3 will be as follows:&#13;
Submission of the remediation work plant:       0.5 months after project start.&#13;
Review and comment by JPS:                       1.0 months after project start.&#13;

JAMAICA PUBLIC SERVICE&#13;
GENERATION RECOVERY AND IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Consultant Services for Cost of Service and Tariff Study&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
Background&#13;
The existing tariff schedule is based on a straightforward structure: (i) a Residential&#13;
Service (Rate 10) with two energy blocks and a customer fixed charge; (ii) a General Service&#13;
(Rate 20) with a flat energy charge and a fixed customer charge; (iii) a Power Service (Rate 40)&#13;
with demand and energy charges, a fixed customer charge and a time-of-day option; (iv) a Large&#13;
Power Service (Rate 50), applicable to primary service loads and a structure similar to Rate 40;&#13;
and (v) a Street Lighting Service (Rate 60) with a flat rate per type of lamp. Credits are provided&#13;
for transformer ownership and primary metering. All rates incorporate a fuel adjustment clause&#13;
which provides for an automatic (albeit lagged) adjustment according to fuel cost variations, and a&#13;
foreign exchange adjustment clause which allows Jamaica Public Service Company Ltd. (JPS) to&#13;
recover tariff loss due to exchange rate changes, linked to its foreign currency expenses&#13;
(estimated to be on average 75% of its total costs).&#13;
Concerning tariff levels, although JPS average tariff level compares favorably with other&#13;
countries in the region, Coopers &amp; Lybrand (C&amp;L) performed a preliminary evaluation of long-&#13;
run marginal costs as part of the restructuring study. It found that existing average tariffs&#13;
exceeded average marginal costs by about 15%. Additionally, the study showed that significant&#13;
differences existed between tariffs and marginal cost for individual customer categories, ranging&#13;
from +35% for residential customers to -3% for power service. C&amp;L warned that due to the&#13;
limited information available on customer load characteristics, results for individual customer&#13;
categories should be used cautiously. As part of the Power IV Project (Loan 2869-JM) a load&#13;
research program is being carried out in order to determine reliable load composition parameters&#13;
which can be used for the assessment and allocation of costs for tariff setting purposes.&#13;
In view of the planned changes in the regulatory framework for electricity supply and JPS&#13;
privatization process the current electricity pricing system and tariff structure may require&#13;
modifications. Especially the following issues need to be addressed: (1) the tariff does not follow&#13;
the structure of the costs of future supply; (2) the tariff does not provide customers with adequate&#13;
signals for efficient use of electricity in particular since rates do not reflect peak and off peak&#13;
supply costs; (3) generation costs are expected to change when JPS is privatized and purchases&#13;
from independent power producers increases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -&#13;
Study Objective&#13;
The objective of the tariff study is to provide the Government and JPS with an efficient&#13;
pricing system and rate structure for all categories of customers. The rate structure should reflect&#13;
the costs of an efficient supply and provide incentives for the efficient use of electricity within the&#13;
financial and operating constraints of the JPS and any other electricity supplier.&#13;
Additionally, in carrying out the study, the consultant will give the Office of Utility&#13;
Regulation (OUR) and JPS staff the opportunity to learn utility ratemaking in practice through&#13;
their participation in the tariff study.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
Consultancy Inputs&#13;
The study will be carried out over a period of eight months. It is estimated that a total of&#13;
14 man-months of international consultancy inputs will be required. The study will be carried out&#13;
in two phases; Phase one will comprise items A, B and C, and should result in an interim report&#13;
to be completed within three months from the initiation of the study. Comments on the interim&#13;
report will be provided within two weeks of its submission to JPS. Phase two will comprise items&#13;
D, E, and F, and should result in a draft final report to be completed within three months&#13;
following the receipt by the consultants of the comments on the phase one report. Comments on&#13;
the draft final report will be provided within a month of its submission to JPS. Upon receipt of&#13;
comments on the draft final report the consultant should finalize the report within two weeks.&#13;
The final report should incorporate item G of the terms of reference.&#13;
JPS will provide the following facilities to assist carrying out of the study:&#13;
(1)   Suitable counterpart staff,&#13;
(2)   Data collection assistance (JPS will provide the results of a load research&#13;
measuring campaign which is being carried out separately);&#13;
(3)   Office space during field work in Jamaica; and&#13;
(4)   Vehicles including drivers for field work.&#13;
It is estimated that during each phase, the consultant will spend between one and three&#13;
weeks in Jamaica for data collection, analysis, and discussions. The consultant should indicate&#13;
prior to the field work, on the basis of the consultant's experience with similar studies, what&#13;
operational support the consultant expects from JPS to collect relevant information. Work should&#13;
start after February 1995, when preliminary results from the pilot load research program would be&#13;
available. If sufficient information had not been collected for summer season, the consultant&#13;
would use other JPS available historical information to complement collected data.&#13;
Submission of Proposal&#13;
The consultant should submit a proposal stating his/her rates, all applicable conditions, and&#13;
a brief description of the work steps and proposed methodology to fulfill the terms of reference.&#13;
The proposal should contain information on the consultant's professional experience including&#13;
university degrees and dates for each professional member participating in the study, and&#13;
experience in similar studies together with a summary of their objectives, scope and results. The&#13;
economic proposal and the consultants' stated experience in similar studies will be the basis of&#13;
negotiation between the JPS and the consultant.&#13;

JAMAICA PUBLIC SERVICE&#13;
GENERATION RECOVERY AND IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Economic Analysis Methodology&#13;
The economic analysis of the two proposed generation projects is carried out in two stages.&#13;
The first involves the development of the least cost generation expansion plan over the period covered&#13;
by the projects. This is followed by specific analyses of the project costs and benefits to determine&#13;
Benefit to Cost Ratios and Economic Internal Rates of Return (EIRR).&#13;
The least cost generation expansion plan (LCEP) is developed through use of the WASP IH&#13;
simulation program which minimizes annual system operating costs under the expansion parameters,&#13;
candidate generating plants and economic assumptions for the system.&#13;
JPS has recently carried out economic evaluations for the two projects and presented the&#13;
results in a report titled "Economic Justification for the Rehabilitation of Old Harbour Unit No. 4 and&#13;
the High Tech Upgrade of Gas Turbines No. 3,4 &amp; 5" dated October 1994. This report is used a&#13;
starting point for the economic analysis for the Bank review.&#13;
The load forecast used for the evaluation is dated October 1993 and it projects average annual&#13;
rates of growth in net generation and peak demand of 5.3% and 5.2% respectively over the period&#13;
1993 to 2013. A summary of the forecast is given in Table 1. Other economic assumptions and&#13;
candidate plant costs and operating characteristics are listed in Table 2.&#13;
In the determination of the LCEP the candidate plants included oil-fired steam, coal/oil- fired&#13;
stean, medium speed diesel (MSD), low speed diesel (LSD), simple cycle gas turbine and combined&#13;
cycle gas turbine. In addition, a 10 MW test wind farm project was included in the plan. The possible&#13;
utilization of the turbo-generator of OH Unit 4 in a combined cycle operation with two gas&#13;
turbine/generators was also investigated.&#13;
The resulting least cost plan is outlined below along with the scheduled retirements.&#13;
1994         60 MW Emergency Capacity for three years&#13;
1995         72 MW MSD Barge (comnitted)&#13;

1996         Rehabilitation of Old Harbour Unit 4&#13;

Retire Old Harbour Units 1, 2, &amp; 3&#13;
2005         Retire Hunts Bay Unit 6&#13;
In addition to the system optimization runs, JPS was asked to run several sensitivity cases in&#13;
order to give an indication of the relative merits of substituting other candidate plants for the Old&#13;
Harbour Unit 4 and Gas Turbine Units 3, 4, &amp;5 projects. The results are compared below in terms of&#13;
net present value of system annual operating costs, including capital investment in new generating&#13;
plants.&#13;
NPV 1995$&#13;
Least Cost Plan                              2,082 million&#13;
Retire OH Unit 4, no replacement             2,087&#13;
Retire GT Units 3,4,5 in 1998, no replacement  2,086&#13;
Retire OH Unit 4, Add 63 MW Oil/steam in 1999    2,091&#13;
Retire OH Unit 4, Add 60 MW MSD in 1998      2,097&#13;
Retire OH Unit 4, Add 60 MW LSD in 1998      2,101&#13;
As a further demonstration of the justification of the least cost plan, a system expansion&#13;
optimization was run for the case in which OH Unit 4 is not rehabilitated and the WASP program is&#13;
allowed to chose the most economic expansion sequence. The unit retirement schedule was not&#13;
otherwise changed for this run. The resulting schedule of additions is identical to the base case above,&#13;
with a new 63MW oil-fired steam unit in 1999 to replace Old Harbour number 4. given below. The net&#13;
present value for this case is $2,091 million.&#13;
Several other qualitative considerations for the two projects have been advanced by JPS.&#13;
These include the short lead time involved in returning base load generating capacity to the system and&#13;
the relatively low cost of extending the life of this capacity for at least another fifteen years as well as&#13;
the postponement of the need for developing a new plant site. There is also the consideration that&#13;
according to JPS the insurance claim and subsequent recovery of funds could be restricted to the book&#13;
value of the OH Unit 4 boiler if the unit is not replaced with equipment of a similar size and design.&#13;
Based on this least cost analysis it is concluded that the two generation projects should be&#13;
included in the short term expansion sequence of JPS.&#13;
BEN1EFIT COST ANALYSIS&#13;
As mentioned above, each project was also analysed for economic feasibility on an individual&#13;
basis by examining the differences in costs and benefits to JPS between the least cost plan with the&#13;
project included and the same plan without the project included. The investment, O&amp;M, fuel and&#13;
unserved energy costs were determined in each case and the annual net benefits calculated to arrive at&#13;
benefit/cost ratios and economic intemal rates of return.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -&#13;
The annual operating, investment and unserved energy costs were determined from successive&#13;
runs of the generation simulation model with the project in question included and without the project.&#13;
In the without case there were no changes made to the expansion plan, thus the project energy and&#13;
capacity removed from the plan is made up from other units and an increase in unserved energy.&#13;
The "costs" of the project are the related direct investment costs of the generation and other&#13;
facilities included in the project cost estimate, excluding all price contingencies and interest during&#13;
construction. The "benefits" include the differences in other investment costs, O&amp;M, fuel and unserved&#13;
energy costs. For each project a base case is developed based on the economic assumptions in Table 2.&#13;
Additional cases are run in order to examine the sensitivity of the results to changes in key&#13;
assumptions and variables. The sensivity parameters chosen include: capital cost, 0 &amp; M costs,&#13;
discount rate, unit cost of unserved energy and fuel costs. For the OH Unit 4 analysis a case was also&#13;
run in which it is assumed that the insurance payout is only at book value for the boiler and other&#13;
damaged equipment. The effect is to penalize the 'without' case by the difference in the estimated cost&#13;
of the unit repairs ($21 million) and JPS's book value of the damaged assets (approximately $5 million).&#13;
The results of the base case runs and sensitivity analyses are summarized below. The details of&#13;
the base case analysis for each of the generation projects are given in Tables 3 and 4.&#13;
ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM&#13;
The proposed investment in an updated EMS was also analysed in terms of the benefits&#13;
expected to be provided through increased efficiency in daily load dispatch (which translate into fuel&#13;
savings) and improvements in system reliability (reductions in unserved energy). Recent estimates of&#13;
these savings suggest a 2% reduction in the utilitys annual costs bill and a 100/o improvement in&#13;
unserved energy costs.&#13;
Table 5 illustrates the annual flows of costs and benefits for this project. The resulting&#13;
benefit/cost ratio of 1.88 and an EIRR of 20.4% indicate economic feasibility for the proposed&#13;
investment.&#13;

JAMAICA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY&#13;
NOTES ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
Regulation:&#13;
The company operates under an exclusive thirty-nine year All-island Electric License granted on&#13;
August 31, 1978. Under the provisions of the License the operations of the company are subject&#13;
to regulation by the Minister of Public Utilities with power and authority to require observance&#13;
and performance by the company of its obligations under the License, and to regulate the rates&#13;
charged by the company.&#13;
Ownership:&#13;
The govemment is the owner of approximately 99% of the issued ordinary share capital of the&#13;
company, through the Electricity Authority and the Accountant General.&#13;
Summary of Accounting Policies:&#13;
The records of the company are maintained in accordance with the regulations prescribed for&#13;
Public Utilities by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission of the United States, in so far as&#13;
these regulations allow compliance with the Companies Act, the License and directives from the&#13;
Minister.&#13;
(a)   Utility plant and depreciation: In accordance with the License, utility plant and&#13;
replacement of retirement units of property are capitalized and include direct labor,&#13;
materials, indirect charges for administration, transportation and similar items,&#13;
reduced by non-refundable contributions in-aid of construction. The company&#13;
capitalizes an allowance for funds used during construction based on its average&#13;
cost of funds. Replacement of minor items of property are included in&#13;
maintenance expenses. The replacement cost of depreciable units of plant retired&#13;
is eliminated from utility plant accounts and such value plus removal expenses, less&#13;
salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation.&#13;
In accordance with the License, depreciation of utility plant is computed using a straight&#13;
line basis on the replacement cost of such asset in service at the beginning of each month. The&#13;
rates used are in accordance with the License, the composite rate being approximately 4% per&#13;
annum.&#13;
(b)   Materials and supplies: These include construction materials and fuel stocks and&#13;
stated at average cost.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 6-14&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
(c)   Revenue Accounts receivable and unbilled revenue: Revenue consists of cycle&#13;
billings rendered to customers monthly or bi-monthly with an accrual for revenue&#13;
earned but billed subsequent to the end of the period. Accounts receivable&#13;
represent the amount due from customers for billed services less a provision for&#13;
doubtful accounts. Unbilled revenue represents the accrual for electricity supplied&#13;
prior to the year end which is billed subsequently.&#13;
(d)   Deferred expenditures: (i) Debt discount and expenses include issue expenses,&#13;
commitment fees and similar items which are being amortized over the lives of the&#13;
loans to which they relate; and (ii) Other consist of costs which are expected to&#13;
benefit future periods; these are deferred and are either amortized over their&#13;
expected periods of benefit, transferred to plant and equipment or charged against&#13;
income as appropriate.&#13;
(e)   Foreign exchange translation: Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign&#13;
currencies are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet&#13;
date. Any losses or gains not forming part of the revaluation are reflected in&#13;
income.&#13;
(f)    Taxation: Taxation is only recorded if taxable income results from computations&#13;
made in accordance with Taxation note (a) below. No charges or credits for&#13;
deferred taxation are recorded.&#13;
(g)   Pension costs: Pension costs are charged to expense to the extent of actual&#13;
company contributions payable based on percentage of employee pensionable&#13;
earnings.&#13;
Taxation:&#13;
(a)   The principal differences in computing the profit for accounting purposes and the&#13;
taxable profit are: (i) investment allowances equivalent to 20% of the cost of the&#13;
additions to plant are granted for tax purposes; (ii) tax depreciation is significantly&#13;
less than depreciation charged against profit; (iii) the allowance for funds used&#13;
during construction is not included in the profit for tax purposes nor is the&#13;
allowance included in the written down value of fixed assets for tax purposes; (iv)&#13;
preference dividends are deductible for tax purposes; and (v) interest is claimable&#13;
for tax purposes when paid instead of when charged.&#13;
(b)   Taxation is based on the profit for the year adjusted for taxation purposes.&#13;
(c)   During FY93, an appraisal of the company's plant in service was conducted by&#13;
Stone and Webster Management Consultants Incorporated and local independent&#13;
valuators. Land and buildings were restated to current market value and&#13;
depreciated current replacement cost is used.&#13;

Indebtedness of Govt. Agencies to J.P.S.Co.&#13;
Dear Sir,&#13;
This is to confirm that in accordance with Cabinet&#13;
Decision No. 20/95 and consistent with the restructuring of the&#13;
National Water Commission (N.W.C.), the Ministry of Finance and&#13;
Planning has assumed the responsibility for the current&#13;
liabilities of the N.W.C. including the outstanding loans to&#13;
the J.P.S.Co. to the tune of approximately six hundred and&#13;
eighty eight million Jamaican dollars. In addition, the N.W.C.&#13;
is presently paying daily amounts of J$ 2 million and will&#13;
continue to keep their bills paid up-to-date.&#13;
With respect to the other Government Departments and&#13;
Ministries, the Ministry of Finance and Planning ensures that&#13;
from now on sufficient funds will be made available in their&#13;
monthly warrants to defray their indebtedness to J.P.S.Co.&#13;

            Jamaica - Generation Recovery and
            Improvement Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Generation Recovery and Improvement
            Project has the fololwing objectives: 1) to restore
            electricity service to normal conditions as early as
            possible, thus eliminating costly power cuts; 2) to reduce
            generation costs through lower running cost plants, save on
            capital costs by upgrading existing facilities and safeguard
            the system against the breakdown of existing units due to
            extended use; 3) to improve generation security, enhance
            system reliability and control systems to reduce the
            likelihood of future recurrence of generating plant
            incidents by improving the telecommunications and energy
            control systems and by reinforcing the transmission network;
            4) to improve resource allocation through the reform of
            electricity tariffs and ensure that loss of base load
            generation capacity does not adversely affect the
            environment for increasing private sector participation in
            the power sector; and 4) to reduce and control the
            environmental impact associated with power system
            facilities. To achieve these objectives the project
            comprises several components. The first is a restoration of
            Old Habor (OH) unit 3 and OH unit 4 boiler. Second, the
            project calls for life extension of OH unit 4 generation
            turbine and upgrades for gas turbine units 3, 4 and 5.
            Transmission system reinforcements and ugrading of the
            energy control center and associated telecommunications
            facilities are also major concerns. Additionally, consulting
            services will be required for technical supervision and
            project management for the generating system components of
            the project; engineering and management for the
            environmental mitigation component of the project; and cost
            of service and tariff reform studies.
