[Begin Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Good morning. Today is Thursday, June 24, 2004, and Iâ&#128;&#152;m William Becker&#13;
with the Business History Group and the George Washington University. Iâ&#128;&#152;m here today&#13;
at the headquarters of CapitalOne in McLean, Virginia, with Gary L. Perlin. Mr. Perlin,&#13;
itâ&#128;&#152;s nice to see you.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Good morning, Bill.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Iâ&#128;&#152;d like to begin by asking you a few questions about your background.&#13;
When and where were you born?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Okay. I was born on May 8, 1951, in Chicago, Illinois.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And may I ask who your parents were?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Sure. Both my parents are now deceased. They were Judge Maurice and&#13;
Berna Perlin, both of whom were also born in Chicago, each of them being the first in&#13;
their respective families to have been born in this country. I was born in the same hospital&#13;
my father was born in.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And your father was a lawyer, I guess, before he was a judge?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Right. He was an attorney by profession. Actually he had a multi-faceted&#13;
career. He practiced law. He was the president of a large union for a period of time,&#13;
having been a labor lawyer. He was politically active in the city of Chicago and the state&#13;
of Illinois. And ended his career as a judge.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Very good. Do you have siblings? And if so, how many?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: I do. I do have an older brother who is going to be sixty-two. His name is&#13;
Paul. I have a sister, Susan Bialek, who is nearly fifty-nine.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Maybe she wouldnâ&#128;&#152;t want you to remember.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Might not. I saw her last week, though. She looks good.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Where were you educated from K [kindergarten] through twelve?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: I spent all that time in the Chicago public school system and ended up at the&#13;
Stephen T. Mather High School, a graduate of the class of 1968.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                          June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Why did you decide to study at Georgetown University School of Foreign&#13;
Service?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Well, I was first of all interested very much in the social sciences, and I was&#13;
attracted by a curriculum that allowed me to focus my interests almost exclusively in that&#13;
area. I didnâ&#128;&#152;t need to take math or science. I was able to take the equivalent of a triple&#13;
major in history, politics, and economics, which were the three things I was interested in.&#13;
I also was very interested in the opportunity to study in Washington, and I did have an&#13;
interest in international relations. Therefore, it was quite natural for me to want to study&#13;
at a school like Georgetown. Being the youngest in my family, I also was most interested&#13;
in getting a fair distance from home, and that seemed to be about right.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: May I ask, were you under any pressure to become an attorney?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: [Laughter] Yes, I was under pressure as both the youngest in my family but&#13;
also coming from a family of Chicagoans. I guess the strongest pressure was to stay in&#13;
Chicago, most decidedly. My father certainly had high regard for the legal profession,&#13;
was anxious for me toâ&#128;&#148;as he always said, â&#128;&#149;Just get a law degree.â&#128;&#150; I donâ&#128;&#152;t necessarily&#13;
need to practice. In fact, my brother ended up in that category of getting a law degree but&#13;
never practicing. And I was interested in the law, in politics.&#13;
&#13;
But I think it was the year or two after I graduated from Georgetownâ&#128;&#148;in fact during my&#13;
senior year and then for a full year thereafter that I worked on Capitol Hillâ&#128;&#148;that I&#13;
decided I didnâ&#128;&#152;t want to be a lawyer. I was up close to the law and decided I would try&#13;
and make my impact some other way. And ultimately I think my father understood that.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Who did you work for on Capitol Hill?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: I worked for Senator Adlai [E.] Stevenson III just about the time he was&#13;
elected to the Senate in 1969 in a special election designed to fill the unexpired term of&#13;
Senator [Everett M.] Dirksen. Maybe it was 1970, in fact. It must have been the end of&#13;
my junior year, and then I worked for him for a year or so while I was in school, and then&#13;
worked for about a year and a few months after graduation.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. Now at Georgetown, were there professors or fellow students that in&#13;
retrospect you see as having been influential in your later work and your career and, of&#13;
course, your interests?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Sure. I canâ&#128;&#152;t say precisely where I first learned about the work of the World&#13;
Bank, but I do know that it was during my career, my academic career, at Georgetown&#13;
that I learned about the Bank and developed an interest both in the world of development&#13;
and potential careers in the Bank. I know that I designed my postgraduate education to&#13;
help me be positioned to work at the Bank. But as I look back on my time in school, I do&#13;
know one professor in particular who had an effect on my interests. Heâ&#128;&#152;s actually still&#13;
teaching there. Iâ&#128;&#152;ve run into him once or twice. His name is George Viksnins, V-I-K-S-&#13;
N-I-N-S. He was a professor of economics.&#13;
&#13;
                                    Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                          June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The course that he taught that had such an impact on me was Development Economics. I&#13;
found him to be both an inspiring teacher, as well as a course that captured my&#13;
imagination. In fact, to be very clear, my decision to go into the work of development&#13;
came after that course and not in anticipation of it. So I was highly affected by him, by&#13;
that course, by the work. And it propelled me not only to go to schools that I thought&#13;
would prepare me well for at the Bank or elsewhere, but also to concentrate in the area of&#13;
development economics both at the LSE [London School of Economics] and at&#13;
Princeton.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, in the School of Foreign Service, you majored in economics?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: No, I was an international relations major. Most of the studentsâ&#128;&#148;I canâ&#128;&#152;t&#13;
remember the precise percentage, but Iâ&#128;&#152;d say it had to have been at least 80 percentâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
majored in international relations. That was the principal major in the school, and, again,&#13;
you had three to four years each of history, politics, and economics. There was an&#13;
international economic relations major, as I recall. There might have also been an&#13;
international trade major. The course work was not significantly different. It was one or&#13;
two courses here or there that would have made the difference.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And so you started, as you said, to position yourself for a career at the&#13;
Bank. You decided to go on to the London School of Economics.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Right.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Did you go immediately after graduation, or the year after?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: No, I went after the year and several months that I worked on Capitol Hill.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER:       I see.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: And I waited to decide where to go and what to study. In fact, I actually did&#13;
apply to law school as well. In fact, as I was choosing over the course of that year, Iâ&#128;&#152;d&#13;
been accepted at Georgetown Law School, I had been accepted as well to the Harvard&#13;
Kennedy School, but wait-listed, I believe, at the Harvard Law Schoolâ&#128;&#152;s sort of a joint&#13;
program.&#13;
&#13;
But it was during that year that I decided that I wanted to pursue my education in the area&#13;
of economics rather than in law. I was accepted both to the LSE and to Princeton, decided&#13;
I wanted to do both, and Princeton was more than willing to allow me to defer my&#13;
matriculation there so that I could do the year in London.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And how was the year in Londonâ&#128;&#148;or, I should say more specifically, how&#13;
was the year at the LSE?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                          June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: It was a wonderful experience for many reasons. First of all, I think simply&#13;
living abroad is always a good experience. It was an interesting year that I was in&#13;
London. It was during the Yom Kippur War, the oil embargo. There were not one but two&#13;
general elections in the U.K. within the course of twelve months. So a lot of interesting&#13;
developments going on in the U.K. It was also a terrific way, at least for me, having not&#13;
been a pure economics major as an undergrad, I found that the British system of&#13;
education, which depended entirely upon taking exams at the end of your course, was a&#13;
great way for me to be able to use the year that I had to catch myself up, particularly in&#13;
the areas of econometrics and statistics and higher-level calculus and so forth because I&#13;
was able to pace myself, in effect, put together my own learning style and program. And&#13;
it worked extremely well.&#13;
&#13;
I also benefited from the opportunity to study with two distinguished professors of&#13;
development economicsâ&#128;&#148;three, I would sayâ&#128;&#148;while I was there. My tutor was Professor&#13;
H. [Hla] Myint, M-Y-I-N-T, a famous development economist at the time. Interestingly&#13;
and very differentially, Peter Bauer was teaching development economics at the LSE, and&#13;
of course came from a very different style and school of thought. At the time he was&#13;
really just thought of as an iconoclast. And it was really only through the â&#128;&#151;80s and â&#128;&#151;90s,&#13;
under the [Ronald W.] Reagan and [Margaret H.] Thatcher years, that he became a much&#13;
more mainstream development economist. But he was quite different in those days. And&#13;
a young professor by the name of Richard Layard, L-A-Y-A-R-D, who taught a class in&#13;
project analysis, cost-benefit analysis, which, of course, was the real father of economic&#13;
development work at the time. He went on actually to do a lot of groundbreaking work in&#13;
the former Soviet Union shortly after the Wall came down.&#13;
&#13;
And so I had the experience of studying under some really noteworthy professors in a&#13;
format that allowed me to get to know them individually quite well. And also to make&#13;
sure that I had time to catch up with all those people whoâ&#128;&#152;d been economics majors as&#13;
undergrads because of the way the British system worked. I had some noteworthy&#13;
professors in micro- and macro- and econometrics, but Iâ&#128;&#152;d just as soon forget most of&#13;
them.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Did you have colleagues, friends, fellow students whom youâ&#128;&#152;ve remained&#13;
close to or you think had an influence on your later career?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Not particularly. I made a couple of good friends, one British, one Egyptian,&#13;
and we stayed in personal contact for a whileâ&#128;&#148;actually still correspond with one who has&#13;
been living in Singapore most of his life. Professionally there were one or two of my&#13;
colleagues. I became interested when I was at the LSEâ&#128;&#148;I toyed with the notion of&#13;
actually applying to work for the IMF [International Monetary Fund] when I was finished&#13;
with the LSE and skipping Princeton. I donâ&#128;&#152;t recall whether I actually applied or maybe I&#13;
just talked to them, and they discouraged me from doing so at that point. But one of&#13;
those fellows ended up at the IMF who was a contemporary of mine. There might&#13;
actually have been two or three more that I came across, but only later in life, and&#13;
realized that they were at the Bank or the Fund and weâ&#128;&#152;d been at the LSE together.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                          June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Would it be â&#128;&#151;74?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: I finished in LSE, thatâ&#128;&#152;s right, in â&#128;&#151;74. It was the master of science program.&#13;
It was really an option of the student to do it in one year or two. And having been not a&#13;
straight econ major, I really had the choice of working a little bit harder and doing it in&#13;
one or really taking it easy and doing it in two. But because I wanted to go to Princeton as&#13;
well, I took a special calculus and statistics course in the summer prior to the LSE year&#13;
and was able to get the MSc in a year.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: So I left in â&#128;&#151;74.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And so you then started at Princetonâ&#128;&#152;s Woodrow Wilson School [of Public&#13;
and International Affairs] in what would be September, I guess, or the fall of 1974.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN:      It was fall of â&#128;&#151;74.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And what was your experience there?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Also an excellent learning and growing experience. By that time, needless to&#13;
say, my major was economics and public policy, although again I still felt more&#13;
comfortable in the area of applied economics than in the Economics Department. I placed&#13;
out of most of the first year courses, although I did have to take exams in order to place&#13;
out. They wouldnâ&#128;&#152;t just take the year at London to let me do that. It wasnâ&#128;&#152;t very common&#13;
that people did that course in one year. But they allowed me to do that.&#13;
&#13;
And again, I kind of went straight into the second year of micro- and macro-, and then&#13;
had the opportunity to pick electives that were very much in line with my interest. I had&#13;
an opportunity that year: Paul Volker was a visiting professor that year. He was between&#13;
being the Undersecretary of the Treasury and the president of the New York Fed [Federal&#13;
Reserve Bank of New York], and Princeton was a convenient place for him to be. He also&#13;
had an affiliation with the Woodrow Wilson School. Taught a course in international&#13;
financial relations, which obviously was highly interesting to me at that time, had a lot of&#13;
impact on how I thought about the world.&#13;
&#13;
I donâ&#128;&#152;t recall taking a lot of the development courses at Princeton. There was actually a&#13;
development concentration which I did not take because I was interested in bulking up&#13;
my technical expertise in the area of economics. So I took things like operations research&#13;
and so forth and chose to do my research in areas related to development rather than&#13;
taking the development courses that tended to focus mostly on issues of social&#13;
development, which were of less interest to me. I also met my wife, so . . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: You met your wife there. She was a student at Princeton?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                           June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Actually she was a freshman the year I was at Princeton. And we got&#13;
married after her sophomore year. I was already by that time working at the Bank, and&#13;
now our older son is a student there.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And she finished her studies then?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Yes, she finished her degree at Princeton in Near Eastern Studies, and then&#13;
went on to the rabbinical seminary in New York and has been working as a rabbi since&#13;
ordination in 1982.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I was going to ask you about that later. Okay now, so you had already&#13;
decided that you wanted to go to the World Bank, and you worked these programs out&#13;
that prepared you. How did the application process go? And also, did you join the Young&#13;
Professionals Program?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Yes, I did. I joined through the YP Program. I recall that thatâ&#128;&#152;s when the&#13;
Bank recruiter came to Princeton. Of course, the Woodrow Wilson School was quite a&#13;
feeder program to the YP Program. I remember him discouraging me from applying. I&#13;
was quite young at the time. I wasnâ&#128;&#152;t quite twenty-four. I didnâ&#128;&#152;t really have a lot of&#13;
experience in the development field, practical experience, but I was very interested. I had&#13;
already filled out the form, so he took it. Then obviously I went through the interview&#13;
process and ultimately was invited to join the programâ&#128;&#148;I guess it must have been the&#13;
spring of 1975.&#13;
&#13;
It was quite a rigorous process, you know, highly competitive. I remember enjoying the&#13;
interview process a lot. Iâ&#128;&#152;m sure that that was an important factor in my being accepted&#13;
into the program. I felt that a particular strength of mine was being able to interview well.&#13;
And certainly I was committed. It was a long-time interest of mine to work at the Bank. It&#13;
was a competitive year--of course, every year was--but as I recall, there were only two of&#13;
us from the Woodrow Wilson School who were accepted into the program that year. The&#13;
following year, as I recall, it might have been as many as six or seven folks.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now in the YP program, was there anyone who was an instructor there who&#13;
you felt was really quite influential in the course of your career at the Bank&#13;
and elsewhere?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Mm-hmm. Itâ&#128;&#152;s interesting. The YP Program has gone through many&#13;
Iterations . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: . . over the years. And as I recall, it was started shortly after Mr. [Robert S.]&#13;
McNamara arrived. When I joined the program in 1975, therefore, it was only about six&#13;
years old.1 But it was already a point in time where the Bank was reacting to the first few&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
  The Junior Professionals Recruitment and Development Program was inaugurated in June 1962, and was&#13;
renamed Young Professionals Program in 1966.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                             June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
classes of graduates, who were being moved up in the organization very quickly, who&#13;
represented the generalist tradition of the Bank, as opposed to the more specialist, you&#13;
know, engineer, an agronomist, and the sort of heroes of the Bank of the â&#128;&#151;50s and sâ&#128;&#152;60s.&#13;
Moving more towards the economists, more towards the generalists.&#13;
&#13;
There was already a backlash in the Bank against the YP Program. So the reason I&#13;
mention this is that when I arrived in the YP Program, there was no group arrival. I&#13;
believe I started on the same day as maybe one or two other people. I did not know the&#13;
other YPs in my class, if you will. I know that because several yearsâ&#128;&#148;well, several&#13;
decades later when I arrived back at the Bank I started working with people whom I&#13;
found out had been YPs in my year, and I had never met them before.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER:       I see.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: We had no specialized training program; we had no socialization process&#13;
at all. The orientation we went to was the same orientation that everybody else went&#13;
through. I do recall Gene [Eugene H.] Rotberg, Treasurer of the Bank for many years and&#13;
somebody Iâ&#128;&#152;m always proud to say was a predecessor of mine. I remember being&#13;
influenced by his discussion about the magic of the Bank as a financial institution. But&#13;
Iâ&#128;&#152;d have to say that most of the impact that people had on me during my career as a YP&#13;
and the couple of years thereafter were the people in Bank operations with whom I&#13;
worked closely because they really introduced me to the Bank. I had no other&#13;
introduction.&#13;
&#13;
 In that time frame I had two assignments as a YP, as most people did, or at least they did&#13;
then. The first assignment was in Latin America in what was called the Countries&#13;
Programs Department, working specifically on Peru andâ&#128;&#148;I only worked on Peru; I donâ&#128;&#152;t&#13;
remember what the other countries in the division were. I believe it might have been&#13;
Bolivia and Ecuador. And I worked closely with three or four people whom I still&#13;
remember and came across later in my time at the Bank. I worked most closely under the&#13;
supervision of a country economist by the name of Elkyn, E-L-K-Y-N, Chaparro, C-H-A-&#13;
P-A-R-R-O, a very gifted writer, a gifted thinker, a very lateral thinker.&#13;
&#13;
We were working on what was then called a basic economic report on the country of&#13;
Peru. Those reports were done actually every six or seven years on Bank countries, and&#13;
they were multi-volume reports that actually became the definitive work on the economy&#13;
of that particular country. Sometimes they turned into books. Oftentimes the material was&#13;
kept confidential. I worked with some great project officers: a fellow by the name of&#13;
Eugene [D.] McCarthy, who went on to head the YP Program and worked many years in&#13;
Latin America operations. A fellow by the name of Damien von Stauffenberg, who&#13;
retired, I think, about six, seven years ago, also an excellent project officer. So I had a&#13;
great opportunity to learn from them about the Bank, its history, and its mission.&#13;
&#13;
Then I worked six months in what was then called the Nutrition Division as a YP. It was&#13;
a new division. It was very early on in Mr. McNamaraâ&#128;&#152;s efforts to get involved in the soft&#13;
sectors. He had identified meeting basic human needs as a development objective of the&#13;
&#13;
                                    Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                          June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Bank in the mid-70s. The first nutrition project in the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s history was done in&#13;
Indonesia. I worked on the second, which was in Colombia. And there were a number of,&#13;
again, excellent people that I had the opportunity to work with. A fellow who later&#13;
became the governor of the Central Bank of India by the name of Venkitaramananâ&#128;&#148;S, I&#13;
think, was his first initialâ&#128;&#148;was put in charge of the program.&#13;
&#13;
 Interestingly enough, ironically enough, the Nutrition Division was part of the&#13;
Agriculture Department; that was in the day of the Central Project Staff. Agricultural&#13;
Projects was run by a fellow by the name of Leif [E.] Christoffersen, who was the&#13;
gentleman who had come to Princeton and discouraged me from applying [laughter] for&#13;
the program.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So you ended up more or less working for him.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Absolutely. He was also one of the people, I think, responsible for the&#13;
backlash against the YP Program because having come in within the first year or twoâ&#128;&#148;he&#13;
was either in the first or second YP classâ&#128;&#148;and he ended up working for Mr. McNamara&#13;
as a personal assistant and ended up on a meteoric kind of career in the Bank. He was&#13;
exactly the kind of person that the rest of the Bank was, in effect, not comfortable with&#13;
because of that fast ride and his generalist nature. But Alan Berg was the nutrition advisor&#13;
and has done work probably for the Bank up until this day in the area; did a great job.&#13;
&#13;
Also, interesting footnote: again, people got to know everybody else at the Bank. One of&#13;
the people that worked on that Colombia Nutrition Project with me was a fellow by the&#13;
name of Caio Koch-Weser, whom you probably have interviewed as well. And so I got&#13;
to know Caio and his family quite well at that time. So I had great experiences at YP, but&#13;
they were--at the time, whatever experience you had was based on the luck of who you&#13;
got to work with . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: . . and had very little to do with the rest of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Specifically what were your assignments in these nutrition projects as&#13;
an economist?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: I was an economist, and in the nutrition project, a lot of it had to do with&#13;
calculating the benefit part of the cost-benefit analysis, which, of course, was very much&#13;
art rather than science because it was a soft project. And again, many of the engineers and&#13;
others who had been at the Bank for a long time were scoffing at the notion that the Bank&#13;
should be lending for things like nutrition projects, especially since so much of the&#13;
investment was actually made in local currency. Therefore, without a lot of foreign&#13;
exchange to be financed by the Bank, there was a question as to whether that was in fact&#13;
the highest and best use of the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s foreign exchange access for the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                          June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But it was then that, you know, conditionality became very important because again we&#13;
were disbursing against a lot of domestic currency expenditures. The government had to&#13;
provide the counterpart funding, and then in return the Bank was providing foreign&#13;
exchange for the governmentâ&#128;&#152;s budget. So I remember going around to many of the more&#13;
remote regions of Colombia, many of the Caribbean regions, and working [with] the&#13;
health team to try to quantify the benefits so that we could come up with social returns&#13;
and an economic rate of return in that kind of a project. So it was quite interesting.&#13;
&#13;
In my first assignment as a YP, again we were doing a basic economic report, I did a lot&#13;
of work actually on the tourism sector in Peru, which was highly undeveloped. I&#13;
remember, for example, having the great experience of going up to Machu Picchu and&#13;
experiencing just how hard it was for a tourist to get to places. I went to a lot of regions&#13;
of Peru that subsequently were developed for tourism and identified some of the potential&#13;
for development there. But again, it was a combination of that and also doing some of the&#13;
grunt work in terms of national accounts and working closely with Elkyn, who was the&#13;
country economist on that. So he sort of let me do the tourism part on my own as a way&#13;
of developing my own experiences. And then I did a lot of the number crunching for him&#13;
on the work. So, you know, to me two excellent experiences as a YP.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now what was your next assignment after you finished, nominally&#13;
finished?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Yes, it was a year.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What you were saying it was back in Washington.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Yes. I finished, you know, at the end of a year. I had two or three&#13;
opportunities as so-called permanent assignments. The one that I chose was an economist&#13;
working in the office of the Regional Vice President for what was then called the Eastern&#13;
Africa Region. Africa, as you may know, over the decades was often treated as a single&#13;
region or as multiple regions. At that point in time Eastern Africa included most of&#13;
English-speaking Africa, most of Southern Africa.&#13;
&#13;
It was headed at that point byâ&#128;&#148;Willi [W. A.] Wapenhans was the regional vice president.&#13;
Iâ&#128;&#152;m trying to think whether heâ&#128;&#148;he arrived about the same time I did. I think he was&#13;
preceded by Stanley Please, if Iâ&#128;&#152;m not mistaken. Or perhaps Stanley was the department&#13;
director for one of the two country departments. I canâ&#128;&#152;t quite recall.&#13;
&#13;
But my personal assignment was to work directly for the chief economist, who at the time&#13;
of my arrival was a Swiss national by the name of Rudolf HablÃ¼tzel, H-A-B-L-Ã&#156;-T-Z-E-&#13;
L. And Rudolf was the reason I took that job. I found him to be inspiring. He was a very&#13;
wizened if not all that old kind of economist. Very skeptical, very common sense, very&#13;
speak his mind. He was notably unsuccessful in Bank politics and actually after a year&#13;
ended up being kind of pushed into retirement. But it was a great assignment for me. I&#13;
took it for several reasons. First of all, I wanted to get exposed to Africa. If youâ&#128;&#152;re&#13;
interested in development, you need to do that. I also liked the notion of being in the&#13;
&#13;
                                    Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                          June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
chief economistâ&#128;&#152;s office so that I had kind of a big picture of what was going on at the&#13;
Bank and yet had many opportunities to work in individual African countries. Because of&#13;
the large number of small countries in Africa, I found that I was used as sort of a utility&#13;
infielder, being sent on specific projects to help in the work, actually both projects and&#13;
economic missions.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So you traveled to Africa on missions.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: I traveled to Africa on missions. I worked inâ&#128;&#148;I did work in Zambia, where I&#13;
worked with the Agriculture Department on the development of a number of economic&#13;
models of the Zambian agricultural economy. I ended up working again in Zambia on&#13;
aâ&#128;&#148;I canâ&#128;&#152;t recall whether it was a sector study which was going to lead to a number of&#13;
loans specifically for the copper mining sector which, of course, was the principal foreign&#13;
exchange earner for Zambia.&#13;
&#13;
That turned out to be quite a wonderful experience for me because I ended up on the&#13;
mission becoming the leader of the mission at the ripe young age of about twenty-six,&#13;
simply because the two other folks who were on the mission were both a consultant and a&#13;
brand-new recruit to the Bank, a mining specialist, a Belgian fellow, who had worked in&#13;
South Africa for most of his life. And so I was the only one with Bank experience on the&#13;
mission. I think we did a lot of interesting work that helped both in understanding the&#13;
Zambian economy because it was at the time that there was talk of privatizing some of&#13;
the copper mines. There were some new techniques that were being used, more of what&#13;
you might call strip-mining in this country, new techniques that were being used.&#13;
&#13;
I knew absolutely nothing about mining at all. And I recall having many loud shouting&#13;
matches at night with these two guys, who never saw eye-to-eye, and trying to get them&#13;
to explain to me the fundamentals of mining so that I could understand where their&#13;
technical differences were coming from. And in fact, I recall in putting that report&#13;
together thatâ&#128;&#148;thereâ&#128;&#152;s a whole appendix to that report sitting on some shelf somewhere&#13;
that actually describes the economics of mining, almost Mining Economics 101, which I&#13;
wrote based on the learning that I had from them so that I could understand where in the&#13;
process their technical differences were. So it was a great experience I had there.&#13;
&#13;
I worked in Botswana. We did a country economic report memorandum there. I worked&#13;
with the country economist, a fellow by the name of Carlston [B.] Boucher who then&#13;
went on, I think, to represent the Bank at the UN. I worked in the Sudan, again on mostly&#13;
basic economic-type work, and ended up going to a lot of the regions in the Sudan that&#13;
are troubled to this very day. One thing I can say for sure is that. as a relatively junior&#13;
staff member, I never saw Nairobi. I never got to go to anyplace that most people&#13;
associate with Eastern Africa. I always was going to the more obscure, less popular&#13;
places for people to work.&#13;
&#13;
But, as a result, I had some great learning opportunities. As I say, working in the front&#13;
office of a regional vice president I got more of a sense of how the Bank worked. You&#13;
know, I got involved in things like drafting the Eastern Africa portion of the Bank annual&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                         11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
report, putting together the briefing papers for Mr. McNamara when he met with the&#13;
Caucus of African Governors during the annual meeting. So in addition to working on&#13;
countries, I also had the opportunity to kind of see the region from a slightly eagleâ&#128;&#152;s eye&#13;
point of view and also had a little more experience than I might otherwise have had just&#13;
being exposed to the regional vice president and seeing Mr. McNamara in action.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now did you stay working on East Africa until you left the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: I did. I was there for two years working on Eastern Africa. As I say, the first&#13;
year was under Rudolf HablÃ¼tzel. He was succeeded by a fellow by the name of Ravi&#13;
Gulhati, G-U-L-H-A-T-I, who was Iâ&#128;&#152;d say a much more successful Bank careerist as an&#13;
economist. And so I worked with him the second year. Didn't quite have the opportunity&#13;
with him to learn as much as I did under Rudolf. I donâ&#128;&#152;t think he had much of an impact&#13;
on my thinking. But my departure from the Bank came not because of my disillusionment&#13;
in any way.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: That was going to be my next question.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Yes. It was simply the fact that my wife, who had for two years, the first two&#13;
years of our marriage, lived with me in Washington and then commuted up to Princeton&#13;
every week to finish her undergraduate education, when she graduated from Princeton,&#13;
she was accepted to seminary, the rabbinical seminary. She had a choice of moving to&#13;
Cincinnati or New York. She chose New York because she felt it would be easier for me.&#13;
And I then had to decide whether or not we were going to live in two cities for four years&#13;
or not.&#13;
&#13;
Again, at the ripe old age of about twenty-seven, as enamored as I was of the Bank, and&#13;
as much as I was enjoying myself, I had the notion that it was too early in my life and my&#13;
career to make that big a sacrifice for a long-term career that I wasnâ&#128;&#152;t sure would last&#13;
forever. And in many ways I also had the sense that I wouldâ&#128;&#148;and interestingly enough I&#13;
said it, I believed it, and then I forgot it, although my wife never didâ&#128;&#148;when I left the&#13;
Bank in 1978, I said, you know, â&#128;&#149;Iâ&#128;&#152;m going to get some very good real-life experience&#13;
and maybe come back to the Bank someday and share it.â&#128;&#150; So it was simply a choice at&#13;
that point in time.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So it was a personal choice.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: It was definitely personal. It was not professional in any way. I had other&#13;
opportunities. In fact, I had one or two opportunities at that time that were being offered&#13;
to me for a next assignment.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Within the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Within the Bank. One was, as I recall, it was a country economist in the&#13;
division that covered Paraguay and Uruguay. Then there was a different assignment inâ&#128;&#148;I&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#152;t understand it at the time; I now doâ&#128;&#148;in the Capital and Financial Planning Group&#13;

                           June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
within the Bank. They were sort of gearing up for the potential of capital increase at the&#13;
time, and there was a feeling that someone with my background, you know, on Capitol&#13;
Hill, it might have been an interesting place for me to be. So I had some interesting&#13;
opportunities. But personally, we chose to move to New York.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now in looking for a job in New York, was your World Bank experience a&#13;
plus, a minus, or a neutral?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Thatâ&#128;&#152;s interesting. I remember quite well. It was a plus for certain jobs. The&#13;
interesting thing is that the easiest job for me to have gotten in New York would have&#13;
been in the country risk department of one of the major money-center banks. And it was a&#13;
job I didnâ&#128;&#152;t even think twice about. I had a couple of interviews, and I had the sense that I&#13;
would be doing exactly the same work that I had been doing at the Bank. And I felt if I&#13;
was going to do that same work, I might as well stay at the Bank. I also felt that there was&#13;
a notion that a lot of my value added was going to be simply my knowledge of the Bank&#13;
and the Fund and how to get information and so forth and so on. And it just didnâ&#128;&#152;t fit my&#13;
personal notion of why it was worth moving to New York to do that. So I ended up&#13;
actually interviewing for a number of roles that had to do with the commodities trade.&#13;
And in particular, the job I ended up taking was with a precious metals trading company.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Your mining background days. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Which all of a sudden that background in mining became useful to me. Quite&#13;
frankly, it probably helped that I had also grown up in Chicago, and my older brother was&#13;
a member of the Board of Trade. So, you know, a rather unusual person who kind of&#13;
walks in off the street with an economics degree that understands what it means to trade&#13;
futures, at least in those days, because I had spent some of my summers actually working&#13;
at the Board of Trade, understood how markets worked. And so I ended up starting at a&#13;
company that was trading a variety of commodities, including precious metals. Recall, I&#13;
think it was â&#128;&#151;73, I guess, that President [Richard M.] Nixon lifted the ban on holding gold&#13;
for Americans, something like that, â&#128;&#151;73.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Part of the end of the Bretton Woods System and all?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Absolutely. And so they early on became one of the two or three most&#13;
prominent firms in the trading of precious metals. It was an old commodities firm by the&#13;
name J. Aron &amp; Company, J. A-R-O-N, and they actually got bought out by Goldman&#13;
Sachs in the early â&#128;&#151;80s.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So what was your work like? I mean, was it very much like what you had&#13;
experienced at the Board of Trade?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Yes, it was. It didnâ&#128;&#152;t make any use of my economics background or my&#13;
World Bank experience. It was just a totally different experience. And, I mean, I was&#13;
trading metals. They gave me some of the more cerebral work to do, such as it is. I&#13;
wasnâ&#128;&#152;t on a trading floorâ&#128;&#148;I was on a trading floor in an office as opposed to at an&#13;
&#13;
                                     Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                           June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
exchange. And I had responsibility for three things, which again tended to affect what&#13;
happened next in my life.&#13;
&#13;
The first and primary responsibility I had was for managing the inter-month exposure so&#13;
that, for example, if we had positions in physical commodities, gold, silver, platinum and&#13;
so forth, that were in the current market hedged to the next futures contract, at some point&#13;
in time we needed to roll forward those futures positions. And I was responsible for&#13;
managing the inter-month trading. So again, a bit of the more cerebral part of the work,&#13;
although I never felt that my academic training was at all an advantage in that business&#13;
because it is such an instinctive business.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, thereâ&#128;&#152;s a lot of intuition.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: And, interestingly enough, when my father had given up on my becoming a&#13;
lawyer, his next hope was that I would become a trader on the floor of the Board of Trade&#13;
like my brother, which would both get me home and get me, at least he thought, into a&#13;
very comfortable lifestyle. Interestingly enough, the reason I never did that was that my&#13;
brother and I were and are so different in demeanor and personality and interests, I felt&#13;
that anything at which he could succeed was probably something that I would fail at. And&#13;
he was so successful himself, I chose not to do what he was doing. So I was close but not&#13;
quite in the same field.&#13;
&#13;
Very briefly, the other two things I did: I handled a lot of our third-party customer&#13;
business as broker for folks in the soft commodities business (coffee, cocoa, and other&#13;
things) which taught me how to get up real early in the morning since we traded against&#13;
London. And then third, and probably the most important thing, was as a third-party&#13;
broker. In 1978â&#128;&#148;thatâ&#128;&#152;s when I arrived at J. Aronâ&#128;&#148;was the year when the first Treasury&#13;
bond futures contract was listed. I think the very first financial future, so-called, first&#13;
interest-rate future, was the Ginnie Mae [Government National Mortgage Association]&#13;
contract, which was listed â&#128;&#151;round about 1975 but never developed the liquidity that&#13;
allowed it to really support the rest of the fixed-income markets.&#13;
&#13;
But 1978 was not only a year of tremendous volatility in terms of gold prices, so I learned&#13;
a lot about volatility; it was also the year I believe that Mr. Volker ended up at the Fed&#13;
[Federal Reserve Board] as the chairman of the Fed. And needless to say, interest rates&#13;
started to skyrocket as he tried to control the money supply. And lo and behold, people&#13;
really needed bond futures as a mechanism for managing risk. And so in those days our&#13;
customers were firms like Solomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs, whoâ&#128;&#152;d never thought&#13;
of themselves as being in the commodity business--they were in the stock and bond&#13;
business--so when they wanted to use futures contracts to hedge their bond portfolios,&#13;
they went through us as a third-party broker.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So this is the beginning of your interest in risk management.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Thatâ&#128;&#152;s exactly correct. And it was, again, a very new field in terms of&#13;
&#13;

financial futures. Interestingly enough, I had some interesting clients. My number one&#13;
client was a little-known bond trader at the time, now known as Senator Jon [S.] Corzine.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Uh-huh!&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: He made his name at Goldman Sachs.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER:       Is that right!&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: In the bond department. So it was quite an interesting time. I spent two years&#13;
there at J. Aron &amp; Company. It was, again, something I didnâ&#128;&#152;t feel was going anywhere&#13;
in terms of a long-term career aspiration. I also found that, again, perhaps my own&#13;
personal interest, Iâ&#128;&#152;d sit there sort of writing little notes to put into a file with the notion&#13;
of writing a book somedayâ&#128;&#148;which, of course, I never didâ&#128;&#148;about how the markets&#13;
worked and what was making things happen. And anybody who took time to figure out&#13;
why things were happening, of course, was going to be a very bad trader. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
BECKER:       Itâ&#128;&#152;s very time-sensitive.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Absolutely. And donâ&#128;&#152;t ask why. Just go with the flow.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Just do it.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: And by that time we were halfway done with my wifeâ&#128;&#152;s commitment in New&#13;
York, and I had an interesting offer from a firm that had tried to place me two years&#13;
earlier. It was a head-hunting firm that was also interested in being the first to specialize&#13;
in financial futures and interest-rate risk management. And although I never had a desire&#13;
to be a head-hunter, it struck me as an interesting opportunity for what I hoped would be&#13;
our last two years in New York to learnâ&#128;&#148;I figured Iâ&#128;&#152;d spent two years learning how the&#13;
markets worked, but I didnâ&#128;&#152;t really get to learn who made the markets workâ&#128;&#148;by working&#13;
at this firm by the name of Hadley Lockwood. I donâ&#128;&#152;t even know if they exist today. It&#13;
was a small firm. I had as my clients the New York Stock Exchange, which tried to&#13;
develop a financial futures market; the Chicago Mercantile Exchange; some of the banks&#13;
that had never been involved in futures markets before. I did a number of consulting&#13;
assignments basically suggesting to people that, you know, they called on head-hunters at&#13;
times where they were either getting out of a business or getting into a business. Men&#13;
often needed more background than they had.&#13;
&#13;
I must have done pretty well as a head-hunter because when I spoke with candidates, I&#13;
understood them extremely well and had some success there. So I really learned a lot&#13;
about how the markets worked and who they were and, you know, had access to the&#13;
presidents of various exchanges and so forth. And always had the notionâ&#128;&#148;and, quite&#13;
frankly, thatâ&#128;&#152;s what happened--that somewhere along the line Iâ&#128;&#152;d place myself. And thatâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
how I ended up in round about December of â&#128;&#152;81 or January of â&#128;&#151;82, as I recall, ended up&#13;
getting a call from a candidate whom I had placed at the New York Stock Exchange as&#13;
the head of the research department. He called me up and said, â&#128;&#149;I just got a call from&#13;
&#13;
                                      Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                            June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
another head-hunter who is trying to recruit a head of interest rate risk management for&#13;
Fannie Mae [Federal National Mortgage Association] in Washington.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And the next question, of course.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Right. â&#128;&#149;And I told him that youâ&#128;&#152;re not going to find anybody on earth who&#13;
knows enough about interest rates risk management whoâ&#128;&#152;s going to be willing to live in&#13;
Washington because it's just not a place where financial people go, except for this one&#13;
person whom I happen to know loves Washington and wants to go back.â&#128;&#150; So I got head-&#13;
hunted from my head-hunting firm and ended up at Fannie Mae.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER:       I see. Who do you pay the fee to in circumstances like this, I wonder?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: [Laughter] Exactly. But it was pretty interesting. It was also about three or&#13;
four months before my wifeâ&#128;&#152;s ordination. And, in fact, she didnâ&#128;&#152;t know where she was&#13;
going to be able to end up. But, importantly, she felt that by virtue of my having taken the&#13;
risk of moving to New York, she was willing to figure out what might be available in&#13;
Washington. So I moved down back to Washington a few months before she was&#13;
ordained. Obviously it was a comfortable place for us to be. I rented an apartment in the&#13;
building we used to own an apartment in and then began what turned into an eleven-year&#13;
career at Fannie Mae.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER:       I see. Just passing, is your wife originally from Chicago also?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Sheâ&#128;&#152;s from New York.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Sheâ&#128;&#152;s from New York, okay. So it was a bit of a wrench, although&#13;
Washington down from New York, itâ&#128;&#152;s not that far away.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: And she was never enamored of New York. She grew up on Long Island.&#13;
We actually lived out there for the four years we were up there and loved it. We lived in&#13;
Garden City.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And your view of New York?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: I just never enjoyed New York City. I mean, I think thatâ&#128;&#152;s the cultural sort of&#13;
Chicagoanâ&#128;&#152;s view of the world. But also by that time Iâ&#128;&#152;d already spent four years at&#13;
Georgetown, two years at the Bank or three years at the Bank. And so Washington felt&#13;
more like home than anyplace else. So the opportunity to move back there was something&#13;
we were both anxious to do. And, of course, the opportunity at Fannie Mae was quite&#13;
appealing to me for a couple of reasons. First of all, it was a company that was sort of&#13;
down for the count around that time. A new chairman had just been named, David&#13;
Maxwell. The company was losing a lot of money. They were willing to do a lot of&#13;
important new things in order to survive. So it was kind of an exciting time to be there.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, the â&#128;&#151;70s were a very difficult period.&#13;
&#13;
                                    Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                          June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Oh, absolutely, especially the late â&#128;&#151;70s. I mean, the stock was worth almost&#13;
nothing. So the upside was pretty big. And at that time, without making any value&#13;
judgments on any other time of history, I think the sense of mission of that company was&#13;
still pretty high. It was only about twelve or thirteen years since it had been spun off from&#13;
the government. There was still a notion that its public purpose was very strong. And, in&#13;
fact, because the interest rates, the volatility and the spike in interest rates that threatened&#13;
the very existence of Fannie Mae was also threatening the very existence of the savings&#13;
and loan industry, the role of Fannie Mae in terms of providing support to the mortgage&#13;
market at that time was considered crucial. It was a time that Freddie Mac [Federal Home&#13;
Loan Mortgage Corporation] existed, but was still fully part of the government. Freddie&#13;
Mac had not been spun off yet at that point.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So what was your first title? I mean, youâ&#128;&#152;re going to deal with interest rates.&#13;
But what was your title?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: I went in as the director of hedge management. I was allowed to make my&#13;
own title because they didnâ&#128;&#152;t know what to call it. So they said, â&#128;&#149;What do you think?â&#128;&#150;&#13;
And again, my specific purpose was to develop the capacity to utilize interest rate risk-&#13;
management vehicles to help reduce the volatility of the companyâ&#128;&#152;s exposure to rates.&#13;
&#13;
Interestingly, it was probably the work that I did when I first arrived which was the most&#13;
influential, which was to quantify the risk. Because again, the notion was, you know,&#13;
there are some new instruments out there, interest-rate futures. Swaps were only a year or&#13;
two away, options. And the notion was somehow they were magical instruments that&#13;
made risk go away and that you didnâ&#128;&#152;t need to make any tough decisions anymore. You&#13;
know obviously that wasnâ&#128;&#152;t true.&#13;
&#13;
And so rather than saying, â&#128;&#149;Okay, Iâ&#128;&#152;ll go out and buy or sell a bunch of futures&#13;
contracts,â&#128;&#150; it was, â&#128;&#149;Let us catalogue and quantify the risks that the company faces.&#13;
Decide what risks we are willing to accept and those weâ&#128;&#152;re willing to pay to get rid of.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
So it was a very good opportunity for me to be able to do that. The group was located&#13;
within the Treasurerâ&#128;&#152;s Departmentâ&#128;&#148;balance-sheet management, funding, and the like.&#13;
And so I reported to the treasurer. My next title was vice president for risk management;&#13;
that was about a year later. We had some good experience in getting things up and&#13;
running. Again, I felt it was more important to sort of broaden the title away from just&#13;
hedges to overall risk management.&#13;
&#13;
The interesting part of that experience was that it was probably just a couple of months&#13;
after I arrived that we first started to utilize hedging instruments that, in effect, the back&#13;
had broken on interest rates. So it was the middle of â&#128;&#151;82. It was just after one or another&#13;
of the Mexican debt crises.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: One of the many.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                            June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: That obviously started to affect my life, you know, not for the last time.&#13;
[Laughter] And it was a fascinating time because, needless to say, Fannie Mae had a&#13;
very big mismatch, very short funding, very long assets, very exposed to rising rates, any&#13;
hedge which was going to involve going short interest rate futures to protect against&#13;
interest rate increases shortly after we put our positions on. You know, the bond market&#13;
started to rally, as well as the Euro dollar market, which is where we had some of our&#13;
earliest hedges, and so almost from day one all of the positions I put on were money&#13;
losers.&#13;
&#13;
I felt afterwards it was probably the best thing that ever happened to me, because I had&#13;
everybody in the company recognizing that the size of our futures position was so small&#13;
relative to the interest rate risk inherent in the balance sheet that I used to say,&#13;
â&#128;&#149;Everybody, whenever you see me in the hall, you should look at me and say, â&#128;&#151;Gary, I&#13;
hope youâ&#128;&#152;re losing money today,â&#128;&#152;â&#128;&#150; because overall the company was going to be doing&#13;
much better. And I got a lot of attention from senior management, and the Board saying,&#13;
â&#128;&#149;Whatâ&#128;&#152;s going on there with all those losses?â&#128;&#150; And it made them understand that they&#13;
couldnâ&#128;&#152;t look at hedges without taking a look at the underlying risk that was being&#13;
hedged.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: They also learned a lot about things like basis risk. And I was able to&#13;
demonstrate that had we achieved the same level of interest rate protection without using&#13;
the new instruments that were availableâ&#128;&#148;so, for example, instead of having sold bond&#13;
future or Euro dollar future, we had simply extended the life of Fannie Maeâ&#128;&#152;s liabilitiesâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
we would have been significantly worse off because not only would we have locked in&#13;
the higher interest rates; we would have also locked in the wider spreads that Fannie Mae&#13;
was having to pay at a time that the market was questioning our ability to exist. So, all of&#13;
a sudden I was showing a â&#128;&#149;profitâ&#128;&#150; on my account. And again, it was an exciting time, and&#13;
also one that gave me the opportunity to really understand how the entire balance sheet&#13;
worked.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Would you say thatâ&#128;&#148;I mean, clearly this is cutting-edge kind of thing. In&#13;
one of your speeches you joked that you were one of the first subscribers to the Risk&#13;
Management Magazine.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Yes. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Were there professional associations developing around this specialty of&#13;
risk management? Was this also beginning to be taught in business schools? Was&#13;
Wharton [School] picking up on this or not?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Yes, there were a few, but most of them still werenâ&#128;&#152;t talking about risk&#13;
management per se. So again, there was a magazine called Risk Magazine. I think it&#13;
started around the mid- to late â&#128;&#151;80s. I remember that there was aâ&#128;&#148;there was also a&#13;
weekly. The first thing I remember being written was sort of a weekly professional&#13;
&#13;
                                    Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                          June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
newsletter. There was sort of Bond Week, I think it was called. Then they came out with&#13;
sort of a Risk Management Week. So, yes. I mean, they were really starting then. I&#13;
remember, you know, a lot of the promotion was being done by the futures exchanges at&#13;
the time. So I wasâ&#128;&#148;I did a lot of public speaking. I was on the circuit: the Mercantile&#13;
Exchange, the Board of Trade would always ask me to speak at their conferences to&#13;
demonstrate that here was a respectable corporation that was dealing with commodities.&#13;
Traders, you know, thought of as these cowboys, but doing so for very good reasons.&#13;
&#13;
Interestingly enough for this conversation, it was in the mid-â&#128;&#151;80s, I think, that I paid my&#13;
first visit back to the World Bank because some of the folks at the World Bank were&#13;
interested in getting the Bank to start using derivatives. Because at the time, although&#13;
they were already into the swap marketâ&#128;&#148;because, of course, the Bank started in 1983, I&#13;
guess, with the first interest-rate swapâ&#128;&#148;did not use futures. And again, they were thought&#13;
of as speculative instruments and so forth. I remember being brought in by a bunch of&#13;
people, including Jean-FranÃ§ois Rischard, someone whom I came across much later in&#13;
lifeâ&#128;&#148;weâ&#128;&#152;ll talk about thatâ&#128;&#148;a 1975 YP whom I had never met before. I actually met him&#13;
because by that time I was treasurer of Fannie Mae, and I was trying to sell him Fannie&#13;
Mae bonds because he was the director of the investment department at the Bank, and I&#13;
wanted him to buy Fannie Mae bonds. And he brought me in to talk to Gene Rotberg to&#13;
try and convince him that it was okay to use futures. So I gave him a call at the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Did you convince Rotberg?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: I think I did. I think I did. And so, again, I had forgotten about the Bank&#13;
mostly in my life. But it was an example of the kind of thing I was doing. And, yes, it&#13;
was kind of cutting edge. I ended up getting asked to do a number of things. I was one of&#13;
the first public directors of the Futures Industry Association. I was asked to serve on the&#13;
Financial Products Advisory Committee to the CFTC [Commodity Futures Trading&#13;
Commission]. So, yes, I was involved in a lot of things. The Risk Management&#13;
Association, the Financial Engineering Association, those groups had not yet developed.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: They were later.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Yes. Among the academics, I guess they were starting to teach courses in&#13;
derivatives and in options theory and so forth and so on. I remember coming across early&#13;
on a fellow by the name of Bob Mackay, M-A-C-K-A-Y, who had a Center for the Study&#13;
of Futures Markets located in Virginia Tech on their northern Virginia campus. He was&#13;
out and about. So, yes, there was a Commodities Law Institute at, I think it was, DePaul.&#13;
It was one of the Chicago schools. So it was kind of an early stage for development of&#13;
that business.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So eventually youâ&#128;&#152;re promoted toâ&#128;&#148;you said treasurer, but also senior vice&#13;
president for finance.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Thatâ&#128;&#152;s right. It was senior vice president for finance and treasurer; it&#13;
happened in 1985 when my predecessor left. And so I then had responsibility for all&#13;
&#13;
                                    Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                          June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
funding and cash management and investment portfolio management, as well as interest&#13;
rate risk management. By that time it was more of an execution responsibility, the interest&#13;
rate risk strategies because the portfolio strategy was being done elsewhere by that time.&#13;
So I spent probably more of my time worrying about funding strategies, about macro&#13;
balance sheet management issues. So by that time it was a matter of starting to embed&#13;
options in our debt in order to match off the options that existed in mortgages with&#13;
homeowners having the right to prepay. So I actually then spent, I guess that was the&#13;
beginning of eight years as treasurer of Fannie Mae.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now in that position, what would you say in terms of your future at the&#13;
Bank, the World Bank, what experiences later on influenced what you were to do at the&#13;
Bank?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Well, thatâ&#128;&#152;s an interesting question, Bill, because I think that certainly the&#13;
whole experience of the â&#128;&#151;80s, with the demise of the savings and loan industry and the&#13;
buildup of Fannie Mae and ultimately Freddie Mac and the whole secondary market as&#13;
the principal source of housing finance in the U.S., I got to see sort of macro market&#13;
changes and to be part of those. Because one of the things I needed to doâ&#128;&#148;we all needed&#13;
to do; it obviously wasnâ&#128;&#152;t a one-man jobâ&#128;&#148;was to position a company like Fannie Mae to&#13;
be able to handle the kind of volume that ultimately was going to come our way with the&#13;
disappearance of so many of the savings and loans. And so it was, you know, how to&#13;
develop debt instruments and debt markets that would be extremely deep because our&#13;
funding needs went up just astronomically. And since then theyâ&#128;&#152;ve gone up even more.&#13;
&#13;
So I think the whole notion of developing markets, developing new Instruments, the&#13;
importance of liquidity; medium-term notes (we were an early user of those), options,&#13;
embedded debt, all those sorts of things. And we could never just sort of sit back and be a&#13;
price taker. We actually had to go out and work with investors and work with investment&#13;
banks to develop the market for the kinds of instruments that we had a unique need to&#13;
issue. So I learned a lot about issues of market development.&#13;
&#13;
I also feltâ&#128;&#148;and to some extent this was again all with hindsight, not foresightâ&#128;&#148;that I said&#13;
when I arrived at the Bank that in many ways it was working in an institution that&#13;
brought together some aspect of public support and capital markets and the whole issues&#13;
of governance around that, both the corporate governance but also the interplay with the&#13;
public sector that was probably the most crucial in terms of my understanding about what&#13;
it meant to develop markets, what it meant for the World Bank to play a role as a&#13;
government-sponsored, government-owned kind of financial institution, and what it&#13;
meant to be a publicly-sponsored financial institution. And, of course, at Fannie Mae I&#13;
always used to point to the fact that we really werenâ&#128;&#152;t all that unusual when people sort of&#13;
said, â&#128;&#149;Well, we should take away the government sponsorship from you.â&#128;&#150; My point&#13;
always was, â&#128;&#149;Well, look, itâ&#128;&#152;s not even a government guarantee. Itâ&#128;&#152;s an implied sort of&#13;
support. You know, 60 or 70 percent of the liabilities of Citibank are government-&#13;
guaranteed deposits.â&#128;&#150; So, you know.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Whatâ&#128;&#152;s the difference?&#13;
&#13;
                                    Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                          June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: And the real difference, of course, was that we were capital market-funded&#13;
and not deposit-funded. And so I think it was throughout the course of the 1980s that you&#13;
saw the power of the capital markets to overtake banks as the principal source of finance.&#13;
In the case that I was most familiar with, in the whole area of housing finance, basically&#13;
the banks got totally dis-intermediated by the capital markets. And interestinglyâ&#128;&#148;and&#13;
again in sort of another aside that I didnâ&#128;&#152;t pick up on for another ten years until I ended&#13;
up in my current position hereâ&#128;&#148;I always used to say, â&#128;&#149;Well, look at the credit card&#13;
securities industry. This is totally dis-intermediating banks.â&#128;&#150; And by the way, one of the&#13;
learnings that I had was that credit card-backed securities, auto loan-backed securities,&#13;
were all being developed without a government-sponsored entity involved. So I really&#13;
learned that. I didnâ&#128;&#152;t give you a history. Itâ&#128;&#152;s in a book somewhere written for the Bank,&#13;
you know, about the history of the U.S. mortgage market.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER:       Iâ&#128;&#152;d like to see that.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: And how it was truly a matter of happenstance that Fannie Mae was created&#13;
not because of anybody foreseeing what was going to happen in the 1980s, but in&#13;
response to the 1930s. I mean, it was created the first time the banking system failed, the&#13;
mortgage market, which was the Depression, the closing of the banks, the calling of the&#13;
balloon loans and so forth and so on. And, of course, the whole notion was not just to&#13;
create Fannie Mae. It was to create a whole network of so-called national mortgage&#13;
associations. It was to be a different kind of financial institution that was supposed to&#13;
replace the banks and S&amp;Ls [savings and loan associations].&#13;
&#13;
Now, as it turns out, the banks and S&amp;Ls rose again and kept that market. Fannie Mae&#13;
was created to create a secondary market for the other national mortgage associations.&#13;
None of them ever got created. And Fannie Mae was kind of a sleepy old organization&#13;
just dealing with mortgage bankers for three decades before it was spun off. And slowly&#13;
but surely the secondary market started to call the tune. And because of that, Fannie Mae&#13;
had pricing power. But much more importantly than that, it had the power of&#13;
standardizing the mortgage instrument.&#13;
&#13;
It was probably that more than anything else that permitted the development of the&#13;
secondary market because you had this instrument that everybody accepted. And then&#13;
Fannie Mae again, throughout the â&#128;&#151;80s, it basically is the price setter. It also not only had&#13;
the documentation that standardized the mortgage instrument, but it could also essentially&#13;
set the credit standards: you know, what was an acceptable loan to value and so on. And&#13;
by and large, Fannie Maeâ&#128;&#152;s market power allowed it to create a commoditized mortgage&#13;
instrument.&#13;
&#13;
And so I guess itâ&#128;&#152;s bit of a long-winded answer, but it was the whole dis-intermediation&#13;
of banking. It was the explosive growth of the capital markets as the source of financing&#13;
for a lot of instruments. It was the evolution of a government-sponsored entity into a very&#13;
market-oriented one, although with some controversial ties, which I would change if it&#13;
were for me to change today, but thatâ&#128;&#152;s another issue for another day. It was just a terrific&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                           21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
set of experiences for me seeing markets develop. And once again, thatâ&#128;&#152;s where the&#13;
notion of the development of markets comes from.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So what you seeâ&#128;&#148;what comes out of this is you get a sense of the changing&#13;
dynamics in capital markets and finance more generally.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Right.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What influenceâ&#128;&#148;you said Mexico was to come back to haunt you more&#13;
than once. I mean, the â&#128;&#151;80s are a very difficult time, especially in Latin America. What&#13;
influence, if any, did that have on what you were doing at Fannie Mae?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: It had very little with one exception, which Iâ&#128;&#152;ll mention. To a large extent I&#13;
think my notion of what was going on in lesser-developed countries was largely&#13;
something that was keeping banks so busy trying to deal with the losses they had on their&#13;
dollar loans and so forth that there was plenty of room for the capital markets to come in&#13;
and take over in the commoditized lending. So the only time where I sort of started to get&#13;
back to my roots in terms of development was in 1990. So I still had a couple of years left&#13;
at Fannie Mae.&#13;
&#13;
We started to get requests from foreign countries to say, â&#128;&#149;Could you tell us how you built&#13;
such an efficient mortgage market? Weâ&#128;&#152;d like to follow your experience.â&#128;&#150; And, in&#13;
particular, a lot of the transition countries that didnâ&#128;&#152;t have the primary markets to begin&#13;
with figured, â&#128;&#149;Well, why donâ&#128;&#152;t we just skip a phase and go straight to a secondary market&#13;
model?â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
I remember working with, well, first, at the time, with David Maxwell, who was still our&#13;
chairman at the time at Fannie Mae, a very influential person in my life. David had a very&#13;
global outlook, and yet Fannie Mae as a company had such restrictions that we were&#13;
looking for ways to engage internationally. Now, the way we did engage internationally,&#13;
starting back in probably as early as â&#128;&#151;83, â&#128;&#151;84, certainly a lot of my time as treasurer at&#13;
Fannie Mae, one of my special goals was to extend our investor base outside of the U.S.&#13;
So I did spend a lot of time in Europe and in Japan. Dave was very enamored of the fact&#13;
that Fannie Mae had an international reputation, and he didnâ&#128;&#152;t know what to do with it&#13;
because all we could do was put international liabilities on the balance sheet; we couldnâ&#128;&#152;t&#13;
put international assets on the balance sheet. So he said, â&#128;&#149;Why donâ&#128;&#152;t you find ways,&#13;
Gary, of getting us involved?â&#128;&#150; And we did look at sort of taking little, small interests in&#13;
some securitization channels externally that wouldnâ&#128;&#152;t go afoul of our charter.&#13;
&#13;
But one of the things we did, we created an international housing finance consulting&#13;
business at Fannie Mae, a little small group, did nothing but sort of cover its costs. And,&#13;
effectively, we did it as a public relations exercise, suggesting that if over the long run&#13;
our goal was to maintain the franchise and maintain the support of the U.S. Congress and&#13;
government, what better way to prove the value of our model than the fact that everybody&#13;
else in the world was going to try and mimic ours. So we ended up in a whole bunch of&#13;
places. I spent a lot of time in Poland that year. I guess that sort of interest in market&#13;
&#13;
                                    Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                          June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
development was re-ignited in me. Again, it was a relatively small part of my life at the&#13;
time because we had a company to run. But I quite enjoyed that experience.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What in 1993 led you to leave Fannie Mae? Obviously, you were having a&#13;
good time.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: It was 1993 in January or thereabouts. And I left for, I guess, for a couple of&#13;
reasons. First of all, David Maxwell, whom I had worked for for ten years, retired, and&#13;
sort of a new crew was starting to come in. I also felt to a large extent, from a&#13;
professional standpoint, that we had kind of turned around that big old battleship. It&#13;
wasnâ&#128;&#152;t as much fun anymore. A lot of peopleâ&#128;&#148;I found the internal politics were getting&#13;
a little heavier. I also felt that there was very little interest in rethinking what Fannie Mae&#13;
could be and that management was basically devoted to maintaining the cash cow that we&#13;
had created in many ways and that the skills that were going to be prized in the company&#13;
were more political than economic and financial.&#13;
&#13;
 And finally, I found myself feeling the only reason I was going to work every day was&#13;
for a paycheck, and I didnâ&#128;&#152;t like that feeling. And although I was not at the point of what&#13;
I would consider being so independently wealthy that I could afford not to work at all, I&#13;
felt that, again, at the ripe old age of what would then have been forty-two, or going on&#13;
forty-two, that I had enough that I never had to do a job that I didnâ&#128;&#152;t enjoy again. And I&#13;
really took that to heart. And I also felt, after eleven years at Fannie Mae, that I was so&#13;
personally connected, my whole persona was so tightly connected to Fannie Mae, that&#13;
nobody would ever offer me another interesting job because they couldnâ&#128;&#152;t see me doing&#13;
any other jobs.&#13;
&#13;
So I felt in some sort of piqueâ&#128;&#148;I canâ&#128;&#152;t remember what it wasâ&#128;&#148;but Iâ&#128;&#152;m sure it was after&#13;
I got my bonus in January of â&#128;&#151;93, I up and left, and said, â&#128;&#149;Iâ&#128;&#152;m going to do something&#13;
different. I donâ&#128;&#152;t know what it is, but Iâ&#128;&#152;m going to leave.â&#128;&#150; And I spent about four or five&#13;
months enjoying my children, who at that time were still pretty young, kind of six and&#13;
seven or something like that, around that time. And I got to spend my fatherâ&#128;&#152;s last month&#13;
on earth with him, which happened to be at that time. So I was pretty blessed to have that&#13;
time with him. And I figured it was time to do something else. So it was just Iâ&#128;&#152;d had&#13;
enough.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So you had these four or five months to decide what you wanted to do.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Right.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So is it that after these months your wife said, You have to get out of the&#13;
house?â&#128;&#150; [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;

                           June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: No, actually she recalls that I promised Iâ&#128;&#152;d stay home for another few years.&#13;
She had a lot of projects for me to do.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER:       I see.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: No, I think it was probably my little one at the time, who was seven years&#13;
old, who told me that he was very happy that I was home every day when he came home&#13;
from school because he had someone to play basketball with, but he was also ready for&#13;
me to go back to work because his biggest complaint was that there were too many&#13;
vegetables at dinner because somebody was home and had time to actually plan a meal&#13;
for a change. So he said, â&#128;&#149;Go back to work, so we can go back to McDonaldâ&#128;&#152;s.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
BECKER:       I see.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: But, no, I had a number of interesting opportunities. Of course, the [William&#13;
J.] Clinton Administration had just come into office. I happened to have been a life-long&#13;
Democrat and was actually being considered for a couple of roles: as chairman of the&#13;
CFTC again, sort of not out of the blue. But it was then that I got a call from Jean-&#13;
FranÃ§ois Rischard at the Bank, who himself had left the Bank, by the way, after he&#13;
worked in the Treasury of the Bank, and he went off to work for Drexel-Burnham, came&#13;
back and was now heading up a new vice presidency called Finance and Private Sector&#13;
Development, FPD. And he was looking to hire the first director of the Financial Sector&#13;
Development Department. Interestingly, he had been directed to me by another old&#13;
colleague from the Bank, a fellow by the name of Ken Lay, whoâ&#128;&#152;s still there. Not the&#13;
Enron Ken Lay.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Not Enronâ&#128;&#152;s Ken Lay.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: No, no. Ken was somebody who had worked in the Treasurerâ&#128;&#152;s Department&#13;
at the Bank and was one of the two or three developers of the so-called global bond&#13;
product in the late 1980s, and Ken and I had a lot of interaction. And because he and I&#13;
had come across each other several times while I was at Fannie Maeâ&#128;&#148;he knew I had left,&#13;
and suggested to Jean-FranÃ§ois that he call me.&#13;
&#13;
So I went to talk to Jean-FranÃ§ois. My wife reminded me then that I had always said I&#13;
was going to go back to the Bank someday after I had a lot of experience that I could&#13;
bring to it. It had been fifteen years. But it was a pretty exciting time, I thought,&#13;
interesting opportunity. The work I had been doing in some of the transition economies&#13;
of Eastern Europe kind of re-whetted my appetite for development. Again, I had a world&#13;
view that maybe I hadnâ&#128;&#152;t quite articulated about the importance of market development&#13;
and the fact that it probably needed a bit of government involvement to some extent.&#13;
&#13;
I met with a number of people at the Bank. And I had the sense that my Bank credentials,&#13;
as old and rusty as they were, still made me more of a trusted insider than an outsider.&#13;
And I also found at the Bank that there was, at the same time they liked people who&#13;
spoke their language, there was this sort of deep respect for the private sector and people&#13;
&#13;
                                    Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                          June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
who had made it in the private sector. And I had the sense of the comparative advantage&#13;
of being someone trusted in the Bank but also someone who could speak with the&#13;
authority of having actually done it, not just talked about it. I think there was also a sense&#13;
of, boy, this guy is going to have a different value system in terms of his career at the&#13;
Bank because he doesnâ&#128;&#152;t actually need a job. He doesnâ&#128;&#152;t need to work. And I sort of let&#13;
people count my money without ever letting them know whether or not they were right.&#13;
&#13;
It was kind of an interesting place for me to be. But it was a job I really wanted to do. I&#13;
felt that, again, just as I didnâ&#128;&#152;t want to go from the World Bank in 1978 to a job as a&#13;
country economist for a commercial bank, I didnâ&#128;&#152;t want to go from being treasurer of&#13;
Fannie Mae to being treasurer of another institution. I always felt the guys on the assets&#13;
side had more fun. And so here was a chance for me to do that.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Did you meet with the president, who was a Morgan banker?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: No, I did not. He would have been Lewis [T.] Preston. I met with Ernie&#13;
[Ernest] Stern, who was the de facto runner of the Bank, someone I had known very&#13;
tangentially in my various and sundry roles over the years. So I met with Ernie, I met&#13;
with, you know, most of the other long-time powerhouses in the Bank. So it was people&#13;
like Shahid Husain, who was the vice president for Latin America at the time. No, I take&#13;
that back. No, maybe he was in charge ofâ&#128;&#148;yes, he was in charge of Latin America at the&#13;
time, not in charge of personnel. He moved into that role later. And again, you know, to&#13;
him the fact that I was a YP made all the difference in the world. But I knew that Jean-&#13;
FranÃ§ois had been put into his role by Lew Preston. I met Lewis Preston shortly after I&#13;
arrived and got to know him very briefly. Of course, he was already taken ill. But I knew&#13;
Jessica [P.] Einhorn quite well, and I talked to her about the role. So I was actually less&#13;
interested in the sort of senior-level sponsorship and more interested in whether or not&#13;
there was effective demand out there. And I felt that this was not a role that depended&#13;
upon the whim of a bureaucrat. This was something thatâ&#128;&#148;this was where the world was&#13;
going. So I had a little bit of zeal. And, in a sense, I wanted to create something in my&#13;
own making, or of my own making.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now did you think that Bank officials had a clear sense of what needed to&#13;
be done? Or did you have a lot of latitude in what you were able to do?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: At the beginning they had very little notion of what we were about. And, of&#13;
course, at the time I sensed that the world had changed, that private markets were going&#13;
to be the way of the future, not only in terms of money coming from private markets in&#13;
the developed countries in the form of bond finance, but that ultimately the funding was&#13;
going to go to the private sector in the developing countries and not just through the&#13;
governments. But there was clearly a lack of good institutional mechanisms within the&#13;
developing countries to officially allocate the resources and to link up to the capital&#13;
markets.&#13;
&#13;
So Jean-FranÃ§ois and I, I think, were kind of a committee of two in the Bank who had&#13;
this notion of what could be, and not so much in terms of the Bank but in terms of what&#13;
&#13;
                                     Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                           June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
could be in the developing countries. It is interesting. I think Jean-FranÃ§ois played an&#13;
important role in the history of the Bank because he never thought too much about what&#13;
instrument that existed in the Bank that would be used to support the work. He thought of&#13;
himself, I think, much more as a consultant to the developing world, and said, â&#128;&#149;Letâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
figure out what you need to do, and letâ&#128;&#152;s not worry about how the Bank is going to&#13;
support you doing it,â&#128;&#150; because that was much more interesting.&#13;
&#13;
And he and I, even from day one, spent a lot of time with a wipe board, sort of mapping&#13;
out what was missing in the way of key infrastructure in bond markets. And I didâ&#128;&#148;I&#13;
couldnâ&#128;&#152;t find myâ&#128;&#148;I havenâ&#128;&#152;t had a chance to go through all my paper files for you; I went&#13;
through my electronic files. But we did a booklet and a presentation for a Board back in&#13;
â&#128;&#151;93, â&#128;&#151;94 on the importance of capital market development and why capital markets were&#13;
supplanting banks in the developed world and why in the developing world we needed to&#13;
find a way to get away from banks and move more towards capital-market funding of&#13;
critical infrastructure development.&#13;
&#13;
One of the reasons we felt that was so important was that not only were banks ill-suited&#13;
to taking the kind of long-term risks that capital markets were much better at handling&#13;
because capital markets werenâ&#128;&#152;t leveraged like the banks were, you had access to long-&#13;
term savings where people had very long-term time horizons and where bond investors&#13;
could diversify their portfolio, and therefore they could take the risk that a bank wasnâ&#128;&#152;t&#13;
willing to take in financing a whole project.&#13;
&#13;
So we kept looking and saying, â&#128;&#149;Well, yeah, but we think in theory capital markets are a&#13;
more efficient financing vehicle for developing activities, but how do you get there? How&#13;
do you develop standardized instruments? How do you develop knowledgeable&#13;
investors? How do you create some of the vital infrastructure in terms of rating agencies&#13;
and bond clearing mechanisms and settlements?â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
And, you know, some countries said, â&#128;&#149;Ah, what we need is electronic trading.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
And I used to say, â&#128;&#149;No, you donâ&#128;&#152;t need electronic trading. You need pockets of risk&#13;
capital that are willing to underwrite bonds. Donâ&#128;&#152;t worry about whether or not they trade&#13;
electronically or on the phone.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
.&#13;
So we were vitally interested in all of this. I hadnâ&#128;&#152;t been at the Bank two weeks before I&#13;
was headed down to Argentina on what became a rather famous project--not a&#13;
particularly successful one by Bank standards--but it was a capital market development&#13;
project in Argentina where the Bank was going to support the capital market&#13;
development project not just by helping them design the structures but also by creating a&#13;
backstop facility that would be the liquidity source of last resort for various kinds of&#13;
bonds that we were hoping would develop.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: In the â&#128;&#151;80s, with the whole re-orientation of the Bank and the sense of its&#13;
mission, wasnâ&#128;&#152;t there interest in developing capital markets in places? You said that it&#13;
was just structure. Or was it maybe just sort of design rather than actual implementation?&#13;
&#13;
                                    Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                          June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Well, I mean, first of all I think, yeah, there was a change in mind-set. I&#13;
mean, people started to recognize the financial sector as being important. And, of course,&#13;
by definition with the role that economics played as the principal discipline practiced by&#13;
bank leaders, you know, the whole notion was, â&#128;&#149;Well, the financial sector, thatâ&#128;&#152;s the&#13;
sector thatâ&#128;&#152;s not the real sector.â&#128;&#150; So somehow itâ&#128;&#152;s not a development tool. Or, you know,&#13;
I guess the Bank during the course of the â&#128;&#151;80s was living through the decline and fall of&#13;
the whole DFC or development finance company movement, the whole notion of using&#13;
the financial sector as a conduit for World Bank funding to get to the real sector without&#13;
worrying too much about the health and development of the intermediaries. And so I&#13;
guess there was a disillusionment with financial intermediaries, partially as a result of the&#13;
fact that the intermediaries that were used were typically government-owned or&#13;
government-guaranteed. Frankly, it was the only way for the Bank to push money&#13;
through because of the need for the government involvement.&#13;
&#13;
So I guess there was a growing disaffection with the financial sector, but most of the&#13;
experience was negative. And therefore they decided, â&#128;&#149;Aha, running our money through&#13;
a government-sponsored or government-owned bank or government-owned development&#13;
finance company and then now allowing them to enforce some kind of financial&#13;
discipline on themselves, at the end of the day the money was getting to the productive&#13;
sector,â&#128;&#150; but we were ruining the intermediaries in the meantime.&#13;
&#13;
And then, you know, every once in a while, theyâ&#128;&#152;d say, â&#128;&#149;Okay, so weâ&#128;&#152;re going to hold&#13;
these intermediaries to a very high standard,â&#128;&#150; and guess what? If you hold intermediaries&#13;
to a very high standard and you guarantee their liabilities, which is usually what happens-&#13;
-you know, the government would come in with Bank support and kind of provide&#13;
funding or guarantee the liabilitiesâ&#128;&#148;well-managed financial institutions didnâ&#128;&#152;t want to&#13;
make loans for risky projects. And you sort of said, â&#128;&#149;Well, should you be disappointed&#13;
that theyâ&#128;&#152;re not funding these development projects, or should you be applauding the fact&#13;
that these are now obviously maturing financial institutions?â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
And so, clearly, a lot of these issues were surfacing, but people didnâ&#128;&#152;t quite understand.&#13;
And again, nobody had a monopoly on knowledge or virtue in all of this. It was like, â&#128;&#149;We&#13;
understand what doesnâ&#128;&#152;t work, but weâ&#128;&#152;re not sure what will,â&#128;&#150; I think was sort of the&#13;
feeling. And, of course, that was the time period as well that with the accession of all the&#13;
transition economies and the former Soviet Union coming into the Bank, there was a lot&#13;
of distraction from what was going on.&#13;
&#13;
So I think there was a growing faith in the capital markets. There was certainly a respect&#13;
for what had happened, again, most importantly, in the U.S. mortgage market. I mean, if&#13;
there was a single market in the 1980s around the entire globe that showed that you could&#13;
dis-intermediate the banks and get to a more efficient means of financing development&#13;
kind of expenditures, it was the U.S. mortgage market. And so, again, there was this&#13;
notion of, â&#128;&#149;Wow, what can we learn from all of that?â&#128;&#150; And the first project I got involved&#13;
in in Argentina, I think--though Iâ&#128;&#152;d love to forget some of it--but one of the things I love&#13;
to remember about it was the fact that, to my recollection, it was the first project in the&#13;
&#13;
                                     Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                           June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
history of the World Bank which had as its principal productive purpose the development&#13;
of a capital market. So it was not the ultimate funding of the industries or the enterprises&#13;
that were going to get the funding. It was the development of the market that in and of&#13;
itself was the productive purpose. And we had it in writing from Ibrahim [F. I.] Shihata&#13;
that that was an appropriate use of the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s funds.&#13;
&#13;
And, you know, a number of things came out of that project: the development of some of&#13;
the earliest rating agencies in Argentina. Iâ&#128;&#152;m not sure Iâ&#128;&#152;d want to spend a whole lot of&#13;
time that we have together kind of thinking about that project per se. Yes, certainly in the&#13;
files of the Bank there are project completion reports; I was interviewed extensively for&#13;
those about what went right, what went wrong. What did we learn? And to a large extent&#13;
the systemic risk in Argentina was so great, you know, that the feeling was that having&#13;
some sort of a backstop facility for bonds in a country where the central bank couldn't be&#13;
a liquidity provider of last resort was pretty much a drop in the bucket. It was kind of&#13;
hard to push a market into existence. But a lot of interesting learnings. Iâ&#128;&#152;m sure&#13;
somewhere in my files I have a history of that project that I think is important for the&#13;
reasons I just described.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now with what you learned in Argentina, were you able to apply this in&#13;
other places?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: We started to develop some ideas for other places. In particular, a lot of my&#13;
early time at the Bank in this go around was spent in trying to focus on other forms of&#13;
market development. So we spent a lot of time trying to develop the institutional&#13;
investors, recognizing that if we got a good source of demand, we would be able to have&#13;
more success. So a lot of effort was going into pension reform, you know, trying to go to&#13;
fully-funded pensions. We tried to get involved in insurance reform, contractual savings,&#13;
figuring that capital market development was a long-term exercise and maybe what we&#13;
needed to do was to create long-term savings that would demand investments. So there&#13;
was a lot of work going on in that field. A lot of my efforts in the early days of the&#13;
Financial Sector Development Department were to get true experts in pension fund&#13;
management, insurance management, and the likes.&#13;
&#13;
We also spent a lot of time working on some innovative ideas around what we were&#13;
thinking of as infrastructure finance facilities. So again, youâ&#128;&#152;ll now see why I said my&#13;
experience at Fannie Mae and dealing with the public and private sectors was so&#13;
influential in my thinking. One of the things we were trying to do was to say, â&#128;&#149;How can&#13;
we take infrastructure development projects?â&#128;&#150; which of course in the early â&#128;&#151;90s was all&#13;
the rage because people started toting up how much energy was going to be demanded by&#13;
these fast-growing economies and so forth, toll roads, all sorts of things. And the question&#13;
was: â&#128;&#149;How can we create projects, infrastructure projects, that would be sufficiently&#13;
credit-worthy that these newly developing sources of long-term savings would be able to&#13;
invest in them, and still not violate their fiduciary responsibilities?â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
So again, you know, we were probably trying to play God a little too much, sort of sitting&#13;
on high saying, â&#128;&#149;How are we going to birth these markets from productive use all the&#13;
&#13;
                                    Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                          June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
way to professional contractual management?â&#128;&#150; And so we started to say, â&#128;&#149;Well, how can&#13;
we find ways to create either government-guaranteed or government-sponsored or&#13;
somehow enhanced financing vehicles for these high-priority development projects, such&#13;
that it would not violate the principles of good sound financial management on the part of&#13;
either the banks or the financial manager?â&#128;&#150; So those were a lot of what I was engaged in,&#13;
what my department was engaged in for the first year and a half of my time at the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
But it was only a year and a half after I arrived that we had the â&#128;&#149;Tequila Crisis.â&#128;&#150; Now all&#13;
of a sudden nobody cared about this anymore because once again the banking systems in&#13;
so many of our developing country clientsâ&#128;&#148;and many of those in places like Mexico, the&#13;
Philippines, Morocco, all sorts of places that we had high hopes of moving to the next&#13;
generation of financial marketsâ&#128;&#148;all of a sudden couldnâ&#128;&#152;t worry about them anymore&#13;
because they were back to square one: â&#128;&#149;What do I do with my failing banking system?â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So that was the next phase.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: The whole next phase for me. And to some extent, again, I got involved inâ&#128;&#148;I&#13;
was sent down to Mexico in January of 1995 by Ernie Stern, who was at that point in&#13;
time acting president of the Bank. Lou had unfortunately passed away, or at least had&#13;
stepped down because of his illness. And I was sent into Mexico saying, you know, find a&#13;
way to get a billion dollars into that country right away, that has something to do with the&#13;
rebuilding of the banking system. We were part of an overall package, remember, that&#13;
was managed by the U.S. Treasury.&#13;
&#13;
And we did get involved. We put together, I think, a pretty good banking loan, a billion-&#13;
dollar loan, biggest that the Bank ever made. Very fast-disbursing., and all around&#13;
making sure that the supervision was being done properly, the liquidation of the failing&#13;
banks. Interesting fights with the IMF at the time because the Bank was interested in, you&#13;
know, â&#128;&#149;What does it mean to make a twenty-year loan for bank restructuring?â&#128;&#150; Our view&#13;
was, â&#128;&#149;Look, over the long haul, the faster you close down the insolvent banks, the better&#13;
off you will be.â&#128;&#150; But if youâ&#128;&#152;re looking at it from the standpoint of this yearâ&#128;&#152;s budget&#13;
deficit, they couldnâ&#128;&#152;t afford to pay off the depositors. And they werenâ&#128;&#152;t willing to create a&#13;
run on the banks.&#13;
&#13;
So it was a really interesting time for the Bank, although I must admit that not having&#13;
been a banker per se, always having been pretty much a capital markets creature, I wasnâ&#128;&#152;t&#13;
particularly well suited to that role. I kept running up against the problem of what does it&#13;
mean for the Bank to support the financial sector when, at the end of the day, itâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
probably not about putting Bank money in; itâ&#128;&#152;s more about trying to reform the sector.&#13;
&#13;
So at that point in time, Jim [James D.] Wolfensohn had arrived and asked Jessica&#13;
Einhorn to step into a role as Managing Director, and they needed a Treasurer. He said,&#13;
â&#128;&#149;Iâ&#128;&#152;d love to find somebody whoâ&#128;&#152;s done this job before.â&#128;&#150; And so, you know, I was already&#13;
in the Bank. And while it was not my lifeâ&#128;&#152;s dream to become the Treasurer of the Bank--I&#13;
had done that pretty much for a big institution before--I also felt that I was probably the&#13;
most uniquely qualified person in the world to do that job because Iâ&#128;&#152;d been the treasurer&#13;
&#13;
                                     Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                           June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
of a government-sponsored, triple A, Washington-based institution before. Plus, I had the&#13;
privilege of being the first Treasurer of the Bank whoâ&#128;&#152;d ever worked on the lending side.,&#13;
so I knew what I was financing. I understood how to do it. And it was really that moment&#13;
where Jim said, â&#128;&#149;Iâ&#128;&#152;d really like you to take this job,â&#128;&#150; that I felt I would regret if I didnâ&#128;&#152;t&#13;
do it.&#13;
&#13;
I also had a sense that Mexico was not going to be the last crisis of the â&#128;&#151;90s. And I think I&#13;
gave you an article I wrote at the time back in â&#128;&#151;96 when everybody at the Bank was&#13;
saying, you know, â&#128;&#149;What did we miss? Who lost Mexico? Where did we go wrong?â&#128;&#150; that&#13;
I kept saying, â&#128;&#149;Guys, itâ&#128;&#152;s not Mexico. Itâ&#128;&#152;s the markets that have changed. And itâ&#128;&#152;s the&#13;
interaction of our clients with the markets that have changed.â&#128;&#150; And I had a sense that the&#13;
Bank as a financial institution, having had the experience of saying, â&#128;&#149;Get that billion&#13;
dollars to Mexico fast,â&#128;&#150; that my sense was the Bank as a financial institution was going to&#13;
be playing a much different role in the subsequent years. And that really made my view&#13;
of the role of financial management in the Bank, and specifically as Treasurer, an&#13;
interesting one.&#13;
&#13;
I walked in. I had a very clear list of priorities that I felt were really going to make an&#13;
impact. I thought it was a better place for me to be. And I remember talking to Jim not&#13;
only about what job he wanted me to do as Treasurer but also telling him that financial&#13;
sector development was important, but that he really needed, I felt, a very experienced&#13;
banker and/or bank supervisor in that role, that I was no longer the right guy for that job.&#13;
&#13;
And we had three very clear priorities, and I suggest we end today with what those three&#13;
priorities were, and then weâ&#128;&#152;ll talk tomorrow about whether we actually addressed them.&#13;
But when we first talked about moving into the Treasury, he said, â&#128;&#149;The first thing I need&#13;
to do,â&#128;&#150; he said, â&#128;&#149;weâ&#128;&#152;ve got to fix the way we lend money to countries because it's not&#13;
working. Secondly, I need to understand how weâ&#128;&#152;re managing our balance sheet because&#13;
anything I see that comes out of the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s Treasury is talking about what funding they&#13;
did last month. No oneâ&#128;&#152;s ever talking about the balance sheet.â&#128;&#150; The third thing he wanted&#13;
to do was to take on how we were managing the capital of the Bank, which became a&#13;
very important thing. And I added a fourth to the list, which was how we were managing&#13;
the pension fund of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
So that set up what I considered probably to have been the most successful, gratifying&#13;
professional role I have ever played in my life because I walked into that Treasurerâ&#128;&#152;s job&#13;
knowing what I wanted to do because Iâ&#128;&#152;d done it before and I knew the Bank. And within&#13;
two or three years I was able to kind of get those things done. And I probably never had&#13;
that opportunity again. I mean, Iâ&#128;&#152;ve had great opportunities, but that one was really very&#13;
special to me.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay, good.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: So why donâ&#128;&#152;t we start there at our next session.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Good. Weâ&#128;&#152;ll start there. This is the end of the interview for June 24th.&#13;

[Begin Tape 2, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Good morning. It is Friday, June 25, 2004. And this is William Becker with&#13;
Business History Group and World Bank. And Iâ&#128;&#152;m interviewing again today Gary Perlin&#13;
at the headquarters of CapitalOne in McLean, Virginia. Yesterday when we ended, we&#13;
were talking about your tenure as the Treasurer of the World Bank, and we talked a little&#13;
bit about how President Wolfensohn approached you to take the position. What I didnâ&#128;&#152;t&#13;
get was the date. Do you recall the date?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Great, this is Gary now. The date would have been earlyâ&#128;&#148;letâ&#128;&#152;s call it&#13;
January of 1996.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay, very good.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Because I actually took up the post as Treasurer on or about April 1st of â&#128;&#151;96,&#13;
and I had a couple of months transition time.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And the last thing we were talking about was that Mr. Wolfensohn had set&#13;
some goals that you said you had agreed with, and then you had added a goal of dealing&#13;
with the management of the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s pension fund. So if you could start there, that would&#13;
be great.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Sure. With these goals, absolutely. The first and, again, not all of these were&#13;
unprovoked. I certainly encouraged Jim to think that these were the items that we wanted&#13;
to get our hands around, the first of which was a long-held desire on my part to get away&#13;
from the cost pass-through loan product that the Bank offered. And the way that Jim&#13;
described it, and as often what I did with Jim was essentially take his high-level&#13;
leadership goals and try to demonstrate how on an operating basis some changes were&#13;
required in order to achieve those goals.&#13;
&#13;
And I remember him saying several times that in the early to mid-â&#128;&#151;90s, some of the&#13;
volume of business at the Bank was falling off because many of our biggest borrowers all&#13;
of a sudden had access to the private capital markets that was unprecedented. So among&#13;
Argentina and Brazil and China and the Philippines, Morocco, Taiwan, all of a sudden&#13;
countries that had been heavily dependent on official flows all of a sudden didnâ&#128;&#152;t need us&#13;
anymore.&#13;
&#13;
And I remember Jim used to say that when these customers demonstrated that they no&#13;
longer needed us or voted with their feet that it was telling us one of probably three&#13;
things, all of which may have been true, you know, the first of which was that the Bank&#13;
was too slow, didnâ&#128;&#152;t respond fast enough in terms of dealing with compliance. Secondly,&#13;
that we were too demanding in terms of the conditions that we were putting on the loans,&#13;
&#13;
                                    Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                          June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
especially for borrowers that now had access to the markets that didnâ&#128;&#152;t put conditions on&#13;
them. And third, we werenâ&#128;&#152;t offering a compelling product.&#13;
&#13;
And I remember telling Jim that I was going to take up the product part of his change&#13;
agenda, and I said, â&#128;&#149;Once we change the product, if we still donâ&#128;&#152;t do business, we will&#13;
have narrowed the problem down to the other two issues.â&#128;&#150; So the first issue was fix the&#13;
product, get rid of the cost pass-through currency pool, one-size-fits-all kind of loan. The&#13;
second major area of focus was how we were managing the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s capital, and how we&#13;
were managing the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s liquidity, and Iâ&#128;&#152;ll get into that in a bit. And the third was to&#13;
make sure that our management of the balance sheet was being done on an integrated and&#13;
holistic basis rather than simply on an incremental basis.&#13;
&#13;
Then the fourth item again, which was the pension fund, was a matter of what I sawâ&#128;&#148;and&#13;
it was managed by Treasury, it was overseen by the Pension Finance Committee, which&#13;
until â&#128;&#151;97 was chaired by, I guess from about â&#128;&#151;95 to â&#128;&#151;97, was chaired by Jessica Einhorn;&#13;
before that it had been chaired by Ernie Stern. As Treasurer I became the vice chair of the&#13;
Pension Finance Committee; then when Jessica retired, I became the chair of that&#13;
committee. We had a very substantial actuarial surplus in the fund at the time. It was not&#13;
a surplus that was usable in any way because of the legal structure of the pension fund&#13;
and the fact that that money belonged to the fund and not to the Bank. But I also felt that&#13;
it was a great opportunity to help Jim achieve his stated goals in terms of the management&#13;
of HR, personnel, at the Bank. He said he wanted a one-staff Bank. He didnâ&#128;&#152;t want&#13;
people in regional offices or resident offices to feel like they were totally second-class&#13;
citizens. And he also wanted to facilitate the turnover in the Bank, which was made&#13;
difficult because the pension fund was structured in such a way that it really discouraged&#13;
people from leaving the Bank, particularly in later years, because the defined benefit&#13;
plan, like many, was very back-loaded in its format.&#13;
&#13;
So I suggested while weâ&#128;&#148;I couldnâ&#128;&#152;t take the actuarial surplus of the plan and hand it&#13;
back to the Bank. What I could do was work with HR [Human Resources] at the Bank to&#13;
transform the pension plan going forward so that we could in a sense provide incentives&#13;
for more turnover from those who had participated historically in the plan, start a new&#13;
plan going forward that would be more competitive, and also to make sure that, in effect,&#13;
we used some of the surplus to cover a whole bunch of new liabilities, which were the&#13;
introduction of our resident field staff as well as our converted consultants, and they were&#13;
able to come into the plan because the plan had assets to cover them. So those were the&#13;
four priorities that we agreed upon. And I guess we should just go down the line with&#13;
each of them.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes. Iâ&#128;&#152;d like you to do that.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: First, and the one that I tend to believe was the most significant because&#13;
historically it was the toughest to turn around, was changing the one-loan-product-fits-all&#13;
from the Bank. Now, the one thing that we did not touchâ&#128;&#148;and several years later we&#13;
went back and analyzed but also didnâ&#128;&#152;t changeâ&#128;&#148;is the one-price-fits-all. So I wonâ&#128;&#152;t go&#13;
into that subject. Thereâ&#128;&#152;s a long paper that was done in 1999 or 2000, thereabouts, maybe&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
it was even 2001, where we got kind of pushed by a number of Board [of Executive&#13;
Directors] members into actually looking at the pricing policy of the Bank and the history&#13;
of the one-price-for-all, not discriminating on the basis of price.&#13;
&#13;
My feeling had always been that we were caught in cross currents. There were some who&#13;
said we should subsidize the poor more by giving them a lower price. There were some&#13;
who said we should give a better loan deal to the more credit-worthy countries because&#13;
thatâ&#128;&#152;s the way modern financial institutions work, to do risk-based pricing, and ultimately&#13;
we would lose them if we asked them to cross subsidize too much. And always used to&#13;
say people, you know,â&#128;&#150; I donâ&#128;&#152;t even know if we changed our pricing which direction we&#13;
would move in, let alone how much.â&#128;&#150; And I think there are huge forces in the structure&#13;
and balance of the constituencies of the Bank to keep pricing where itâ&#128;&#152;s at.&#13;
&#13;
So what we did change in the loan productâ&#128;&#148;historically the Bank is a cooperative that&#13;
always, in a sense, passed along its costs to its borrowers. And the feeling was that was&#13;
the best deal for everybody. The principal loan product was a pool of currencies that were&#13;
delivered to our clients at a relatively long-term fixed rate with the notion that it would be&#13;
in their interest to have clarity and in the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s interest to be able to use various and&#13;
sundry currencies.&#13;
&#13;
There were feelings in the early â&#128;&#151;80s, at a time of great volatility in both currencies and&#13;
interest rates, that the Bank was in fact taking too much advantage of its situation. It was,&#13;
in effect, borrowing in a number of currencies. It was using the low interest rate&#13;
currencies to fund its investment portfolio and passing along the cost of its high-rate&#13;
currency to the borrowers. So at the end of the 1980s there was a realignment of the&#13;
lending products. So it was still a pass-through, but they fixed in the currency pool that it&#13;
would be equally one third dollars, one third deutsche marks or Swiss francs, and one&#13;
third yen, with the notion that on average it would suit everybody when of course in&#13;
reality it suited nobody because it was just an average.&#13;
&#13;
So the borrowers were promised, starting in â&#128;&#151;89, that they would always get this fixed&#13;
pool of currencies, and they wouldnâ&#128;&#152;t really know what the duration of the interest rate on&#13;
their loan was. They knew the maturity of the loan itself, but the interest rate was simply&#13;
going to be a somewhat stable rate which the Bank would achieve by borrowing on&#13;
average sort of at five years more or less so that there would be a relative insularity from&#13;
interest-rate volatility.&#13;
&#13;
Now this product was the only one offered, which meant that very few people in the&#13;
Bank, or even in our client countries, really understood them because no one ever had to&#13;
make a choice. It was one-size-fits-all. And so we had â&#128;&#149;loan officersâ&#128;&#150; at some point in&#13;
time in the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s historyâ&#128;&#148;there were people with that actual titleâ&#128;&#148;who werenâ&#128;&#152;t doing&#13;
the work of what officers typically do, which is to match the terms of a loan to the&#13;
particular need of the client, because they were always the same. And it was a very&#13;
complicated loan. As I told people, it was a very simple portfolio because it was only one&#13;
loan product, but the loan product itself was so complex and almost inexplicable; it had&#13;
no market basis.&#13;
&#13;
                                     Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                           June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I remember when I came into the Bank, even when I was director of the Financial Sector&#13;
Department, and customers, clients of the Bank, would always complain to me that they&#13;
couldnâ&#128;&#152;t hedge their exposure because they didnâ&#128;&#152;t know exactly how the loan was going&#13;
to behave. So weâ&#128;&#148;the Bankâ&#128;&#148;were passing along to the customers, in effect, a risk that&#13;
they couldnâ&#128;&#152;t hedge. Now, we did take away the risk of what currencies they were going&#13;
to get, but we didnâ&#128;&#152;t give them a choice, and then on interest rates they never knew&#13;
exactly what they were getting.&#13;
&#13;
So I felt that this was a danger for two reasons: first of all, I sensed that some of our&#13;
clients were borrowing in the market at higher rates simply because they wanted more&#13;
simple instruments. They were willing to haveâ&#128;&#148;rather than a simple portfolio with one&#13;
complex instrument, they would rather have a larger, more complex portfolio of market-&#13;
based instruments, so they were going to the market, paying higher rates, in order to get&#13;
floating rate dollars, which is what many of them wanted because that was their&#13;
benchmark and they wanted to hit their benchmark. And this was good news because a&#13;
lot of debt offices within developing countries were advancing to the point where they&#13;
had clear benchmarks, they were holding themselves accountable, they were managing&#13;
the risks in their sovereign balance sheets, and in effect we were making life more&#13;
difficult for them.&#13;
&#13;
Now I donâ&#128;&#152;t know exactly all of the history of how we got to where we did, but my&#13;
perception is that again we felt that, as the principal source of financing to many&#13;
developing countries, wasnâ&#128;&#152;t it helpful for us to give them a portfolio of currencies&#13;
because they couldnâ&#128;&#152;t get it from the market? Secondly, there was a sense, I believe, on&#13;
the part of some in senior management of the Bank that they weren't absolutely&#13;
convinced that the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s Treasury was capable of managing the risk, so I think they felt&#13;
better passing that risk along to clients. And I think there may have been an un-&#13;
appreciation, a lack of appreciation, of the sophistication and the capacity of the Treasury&#13;
to actually manage that risk, and it may have been simply that the management of the&#13;
Bank was insufficiently financially engaged or knowledgeable that they didnâ&#128;&#152;t quite&#13;
understand how all of this worked. So it just seemed easier to pass all the risk along.&#13;
&#13;
The other concern that I hadâ&#128;&#148;so first of all I was worried that we were losing business&#13;
because we were making it difficult, and we were making it difficult largely for the more&#13;
sophisticated borrowers who were doing the right thing. And we werenâ&#128;&#152;t changing&#13;
enough with them. The other concern that I had was that over time, depending on how&#13;
interest rates would move, the products of the Bank in the mid-â&#128;&#151;90s, which had been&#13;
designed in the â&#128;&#151;80s, were really designed to protect against the risk of higher rates but&#13;
not against the risk of substantially lower rates because that just wasnâ&#128;&#152;t on people's&#13;
minds. But in fact--without getting too technical because of this currency pool loan,&#13;
which was created in such a way that you assumed that no loans would ever get&#13;
prepaidâ&#128;&#148;in fact there was no market-based prepayment penalty. And the notion was the&#13;
Bank could always fund these loans with like thirty-year borrowings because, after all,&#13;
there would be borrowers forever at the Bank who would always be paying the price, that&#13;
in fact when rates went up, the more sophisticated borrowers all kind of jumped into the&#13;
&#13;
                                    Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                          June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       35&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
currency pool because they got some of the historical lower rate, but when rates went&#13;
down they would prepay their loans in order to refinance in the market at a lower cost.&#13;
But because there was no prepayment penaltyâ&#128;&#148;there was a prepayment penalty but not a&#13;
market-based prepayment penaltyâ&#128;&#148;so that if rates went down significantly, then the&#13;
currency pool would actually get hurt because borrowers would be repaying their loans,&#13;
not paying a very substantial penalty, going out and refinancing them, and lo and behold,&#13;
the Bank and the less sophisticated, less credit-worthy borrowers were left holding the&#13;
bag. In fact, thatâ&#128;&#152;s what happened. September 11, 2001, when the Fed cut rates down to a&#13;
percent, we saw this happening quite a bit. Weâ&#128;&#152;ll get to that later.&#13;
&#13;
So there were just lots of reasons to change the product. The Bank certainly had the&#13;
capacity. And so within about six months, we rolled out a product that had been piloted in&#13;
the sort of â&#128;&#151;94 to â&#128;&#151;96 period but with a very limited application and very rationed, which&#13;
was a single-currency loan, which the Bank thought of as being revolutionary. Of course,&#13;
it was probably the simplest instrument you ever saw. It was revolutionary for the Bank,&#13;
but it was very elemental for the rest of the market.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Can I ask you, was there anyâ&#128;&#148;within the Bank itself, was there any&#13;
resistance to simplifying things?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Again, I believe that there was a discomfort at the very senior level of the&#13;
Bank because they werenâ&#128;&#152;t sure that we could manage the risk. I think for the rest of the&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#148;again, they were basically unaware of what we were doing. There were a few&#13;
country operations departments that were getting push back from their clients, but it was&#13;
limited to those countries that were sophisticated enough to recognize that we weren't&#13;
being very responsive to their needs. So they were sort of playing back to usâ&#128;&#148;that is, the&#13;
operations people wereâ&#128;&#148;the concerns from their clients which they didnâ&#128;&#152;t necessarily&#13;
understand or feel empowered to do anything about. So they liked it.&#13;
&#13;
The only push back we got at all was that once we offered a range of choice, just like a&#13;
private investment bank would offer a range of choice or a commercial bank would offer&#13;
a range of choice, all of a sudden we created on the part of both the country and the Bank&#13;
operations teams an obligation to make a choice. And that was creating for them an&#13;
accountability, a need to understand the choices, and to be accountable for the choice&#13;
they made because when we changed the product, we also put into each loan negotiation&#13;
process a whole new series of dialogues that needed to take place, which was: â&#128;&#149;Are you&#13;
going to take fixed or floating?â&#128;&#150; â&#128;&#149;Are you going to take dollars or yen or deutsche&#13;
marks?â&#128;&#150; We created many other options: â&#128;&#149;Would you like an option to change this from&#13;
fixed to floating over time?â&#128;&#150; A lot of borrowers were taking sort of floating-rate dollars&#13;
with the notion that over time if they wanted to convert that to fixed, they could. And we&#13;
gave them that option. If they wanted to go from dollars to a different currency, we were&#13;
going to let them do that. So we were creating work for people, which was youâ&#128;&#152;ve got to&#13;
makeâ&#128;&#148;the countryâ&#128;&#152;s got to make a choice, and the Bank has to do the due diligence that&#13;
says we think itâ&#128;&#152;s a reasonable choice.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                          June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now, we couldnâ&#128;&#152;t make the choice for the country. And, in fact, in all loan documents&#13;
starting back in late â&#128;&#151;96, early â&#128;&#151;97, there became an obligation for the country to say, â&#128;&#149;We&#13;
want the loan to be on the following terms and hereâ&#128;&#152;s why.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
And we said, â&#128;&#149;Look, weâ&#128;&#152;re not in the business of saying whether thatâ&#128;&#152;s a good reason or&#13;
not. We simply for legal reasons need to say itâ&#128;&#152;s their choice and they thought through&#13;
why they want it in this currency or that currency because thatâ&#128;&#152;s the way they keep their&#13;
reserves or thatâ&#128;&#152;s the currency in which they earn their export revenues or whatever the&#13;
case might be.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Was there sufficient personnel within your department in the Bank to&#13;
manage this kind of a change?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: There was absolutely enough capacity within Treasury to manage the risks&#13;
on the balance sheet of the Bank. There was no doubt in my mind that we had that full&#13;
capacity. There were some systems that needed to be built. But there was no question in&#13;
my mind that we had the capacity. What the Bank didnâ&#128;&#152;t have was the capacity to serve&#13;
as bankers to our clients to help them deal with these choices.&#13;
&#13;
So, in fact, one of the first things I did when I became Treasurer was to create a new&#13;
department within Treasury, funded by savings that I got out of efficiencies elsewhere in&#13;
Treasury, called the Financial Products and Services Department because my experience&#13;
in the private sector said to me that we needed in the Bank to have the equivalent of what&#13;
in the private sector would be called, in a financial institution, product management. How&#13;
do youâ&#128;&#148;when the banker who deals with customers brings the customer to the table, and&#13;
they say, â&#128;&#149;Look, weâ&#128;&#152;ve assessed their application for a loan. We deem them to be credit-&#13;
worthy. Now, we need somebody whoâ&#128;&#152;s a specialist to sit down with the client and offer&#13;
them the different financial terms that will apply to their loan that will best meet their&#13;
needs.â&#128;&#150; We did not have that capacity in the Bank. So I created this department. I did an&#13;
extensive search, hiring an outside candidate to head up the department. His name is&#13;
Graeme [Paul] Wheeler, who had been the treasurer of the New Zealand National Debt&#13;
Office. I hired him as the head of the Financial Products and Services Department. And&#13;
as a P.S. now to what weâ&#128;&#152;re going to talk about later, Graeme ultimately I appointed as&#13;
Treasurer of the Bank, and itâ&#128;&#152;s the job he has today. And Graeme did an excellent job.&#13;
Actually he just came out with a book on sovereign debt management.&#13;
&#13;
It was my feeling that as part of the evolution of the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s service to its clients, that for&#13;
many of them, especially the more advanced of the developing countries who now had&#13;
access to a range of market instruments, that part of what the Bank could do to help them&#13;
was to help them understand how to manage liabilities even if they were supplementing&#13;
what they borrowed from the Bank [with] actual borrowings in the market. So we&#13;
encouraged them, for example, to, say, use the Bank to get those currencies and those&#13;
interest-rate positions that will complement your private sector borrowing and lead you to&#13;
a balance sheet that is as risk managed as it can be. But in order to do that we needed to&#13;
work with them and help them. So it was a major change in the way that the Bank was&#13;
willing to do business, and within the first year, the take-up of the new product was over&#13;
&#13;

                           June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       37&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
90 percent, which was to me a clear market validation that when we finally gave people a&#13;
choice, they exercised that choice to take what suited them rather than what suited the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I donâ&#128;&#152;t want to deflect us from the Bank, but in talking about these loan&#13;
products, what kind of loan products did the IFC [International Finance Corporation]&#13;
offer? Were they in the same kind of a strait-jacket as the IBRD [International Bank for&#13;
Reconstruction and Development]?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: No, not at all. In fact, the IFC never had the luxury of dictating loan terms to&#13;
their borrowers because their private sector borrowersâ&#128;&#148;while they may have preferred&#13;
IFC funding to that which they may have gotten elsewhere because of the favorable terms&#13;
and the strong partnershipâ&#128;&#148;if the IFC did not give them market terms, chances are they&#13;
wouldnâ&#128;&#152;t have been able to write much business. Again, the reason the Bank had been&#13;
able to dictate to borrowers the terms of the lending was that the borrowers effectively&#13;
had little choice.&#13;
&#13;
So to me it was part of the sort of monopolistic history and the Bank acting likeâ&#128;&#148;I&#13;
remember calling the Bank in front of Jim and maybe even the Board every once in a&#13;
while, a â&#128;&#149;late stage monopolist,â&#128;&#150; which was never meant to give them comfort. It was&#13;
always designed to say, you know, weâ&#128;&#152;re operating based on the fact that at one point in&#13;
time whatever we said went because people had no choice. But once borrowers started&#13;
having choices, it was, I think, the right time for us to be able to respond, and they&#13;
responded in kind.&#13;
&#13;
Now, one other piece of the puzzle which I think is incredibly important and did take a&#13;
tremendous amount of effort was that we had over a hundred billion dollars equivalent of&#13;
loans on the balance sheet at the time. And we said, â&#128;&#149;If weâ&#128;&#152;ve got this much demand at&#13;
the margin for exercising choice, itâ&#128;&#152;s very important that we think about going back and&#13;
giving borrowers who already have loans on their books and ours an opportunity to re-&#13;
denominate their loans should they wish to because if they want to change it at the&#13;
margin, maybe theyâ&#128;&#152;d like to change not just the flow but also the stock.â&#128;&#150; So we did over&#13;
a two-year time period make an offer to all outstanding currency pool borrowers that they&#13;
could convert their loans from the currency pool to a currency of choice or multiple&#13;
currencies of choice. What we could not do was to free them up any historic costs of the&#13;
loans because the Bank had already locked up that cost on behalf of its borrowers. And in&#13;
the currency choice option we had to offer it, I think, on three or four specific dates&#13;
because, again, it wasnâ&#128;&#152;t a market-based loan. We were readjusting our pool, and, in&#13;
effect, we had to sort of swap out of the currencies that were in the pool into the choice&#13;
that our clients made. So we had to give them like three or four specific dates six months&#13;
apart saying, â&#128;&#149;You may elect any time up until that date that on that date you would like&#13;
us to change the currency composition of your loan.â&#128;&#150; And on that score, my recollection&#13;
is that we had something like 60 to 65 billion dollarsâ&#128;&#152; worth of loans converted which,&#13;
again, 60 to 65 . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Validates it.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                        38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: . . which again, 60 to 65 percent, people said, â&#128;&#149;Now that youâ&#128;&#152;re giving me&#13;
the choice to swap out of what you forced me to take, Iâ&#128;&#152;m going to pick up on that,â&#128;&#150; and&#13;
the process of educating our borrowers as to the option that was being given them.&#13;
Remember, the original product was so obtuse that most people didnâ&#128;&#152;t understand it. To&#13;
let them know that we were giving them the option to go from the old product to a new&#13;
product, that the need not to dictate to them what they should but to educate them about&#13;
their options, the need to provide seminars about debt management and interest rate and&#13;
currency management really put a tremendous demand on this new group, this Financial&#13;
Products and Services Department. But I felt it was not only important in terms of&#13;
servicing our clients; I also worried at that moment that the relevance of the Bank, which&#13;
to me had obviously moved away from financing towards knowledge transfer and policy&#13;
advice and good governance and all of those sorts of things, would be rendered in effect&#13;
useless because we were wrapping it up with a financial product that the market, our&#13;
clients, simply werenâ&#128;&#152;t willing to take. We had this change. It took a couple of years. I&#13;
thought it was something that lots of people would have acknowledged needed to be&#13;
done, but I think somebody just needed to be able to say, â&#128;&#149;And weâ&#128;&#152;re going to do it.&#13;
Weâ&#128;&#152;re going to do it quickly, and weâ&#128;&#152;re going to change it at the margin, and weâ&#128;&#152;re going&#13;
to change it on the stock.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
And Mr. Wolfensohn was extremely supportive of this because, again, it met his need of&#13;
making the Bank relevant, showing that it was becoming more responsive to clients, and&#13;
making sure that clients did not shy away from the good things the Bank could provide&#13;
because we were outmoded in terms of our finances. And for an institution that was&#13;
proudly the inventor of the interest-rate swap, that had really great capacity within its&#13;
Treasury to manage risk, you know, not to offer that service up to our clients I think was&#13;
a really missed opportunity, and Iâ&#128;&#152;m glad that we seized the moment to really handle that.&#13;
&#13;
So even to this day, you know, we actuallyâ&#128;&#148;I canâ&#128;&#152;t remember the exact dateâ&#128;&#148;we finally&#13;
got rid of the currency pool loan in about 2000 or 2001. It became irrelevant. Nobody&#13;
was choosing it anymore. We said, â&#128;&#149;Boy, if anybody wants something that looks like the&#13;
currency pool loan, we can help you create it out of the choices that weâ&#128;&#152;re giving you.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
So I think that was a major change, and it was extremely helpful. And when we talk a&#13;
little bit later about some of the crises, I used the big increase in demand that came in&#13;
some of the crisis countries to accelerate the change because we did not offer them the&#13;
old products. We said to the crisis countries, â&#128;&#149;You must take new products.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
So that was sort of that major change. But I think there was something bigger in all of&#13;
this, which was a recognition that the Bank was a financial institution and that product&#13;
design and delivery was important. So regardless of whether it looked like A or B, just&#13;
the notion that products were important, I think, was very critical, and weâ&#128;&#152;ll come back to&#13;
that later on. That to me was the single most important achievement of the Treasury at&#13;
that time period, most important change. The development of the Products and Services&#13;
Group, you know, to me was very important. It also put a real premium on modernizing a&#13;
lot of the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s Treasury, making it more efficient because I wanted to redirect the&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                            39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
resources towards what I thought were the greater challenges that we were facing. So that&#13;
was one major change.&#13;
&#13;
The second was on how we managed the capital of the Bank. And again, a lot of things&#13;
come back to this very complicated currency pool loan and pass-through, where the Bank&#13;
was, in effect, able to pass along to borrowers its own cost of funds. Now historically as a&#13;
financial institution there was a sense that because the Bank did not have a lender of last&#13;
resort like most banks do, that it required the holding of a lot of capital, a lot of liquidity,&#13;
as a source of assurance that it would always be able to meet its obligations to disburse&#13;
against loans and it would always be available to lend in difficult times. Now, it held,&#13;
therefore, its liquidity in relatively short-term instruments to make sure that the funds&#13;
were available when needed. Then the question was: â&#128;&#149;How would that liquidity be&#13;
funded?â&#128;&#150; The notion had been, â&#128;&#149;Weâ&#128;&#152;ve got to fund it long because if itâ&#128;&#152;s kept short, if we&#13;
have very liquid assets but itâ&#128;&#152;s funded with very short-term liabilities, it might not be&#13;
there when we need it because the liabilities will be running off and weâ&#128;&#152;ll need to repay&#13;
them.â&#128;&#150; So there was a practice of borrowing long and investing short to maintain a lot of&#13;
liquidity.&#13;
&#13;
Well, needless to say, with a normal, upwardly sloped yield curve, thatâ&#128;&#152;s a very&#13;
expensive proposition, to borrow long and lend short. However, there was a sense in the&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#148;and again, I know this always sounds complicated, but it was the way it workedâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
there was this sense that in order to lower this cost of carry on the liquidity portfolio, the&#13;
notion was assign all of the debts, the borrowings of the Bank, to the pool of borrowings&#13;
that would determine the lending rate to the borrowers. So they got, in effect, 100 percent&#13;
of their rate was based on market borrowings by the Bank, largely long term. And we&#13;
invested short in our liquidity portfolio and said that we were funding the portfolio with&#13;
the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s capital. And that was the way we tried to show that we werenâ&#128;&#152;t paying a high&#13;
cost of carry because, after all, the capital of the Bank is a non-interest-bearing liability.&#13;
So the notion was that the borrowers were being funded 100 percent with long-term debt&#13;
and the capital of the Bank was being invested in the short run. And there was a group of&#13;
people who thought this was very prudent because, after all, the market value of the&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#152;s capital was unlikely to become very susceptible to interest rate risk because it was&#13;
invested short. So there was never this question that, you know, the market value of the&#13;
capital would go down.&#13;
&#13;
Now there was another group in the Bank, and I donâ&#128;&#152;t need to go throughâ&#128;&#148;there were&#13;
names of people, but itâ&#128;&#152;s not worth going through thatâ&#128;&#148;there were people who said, â&#128;&#149;No,&#13;
no, no. This doesnâ&#128;&#152;t make sense. Weâ&#128;&#152;re missing a big opportunity for the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s bottom&#13;
line. What we should be doing is we should be funding the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s liquidity with debt.&#13;
And what we can do is we can sell long-term debt, invest it short, and avoid the negative&#13;
carry by swapping the long-term borrowings into floating-rate liabilities. That way weâ&#128;&#152;re&#13;
sure we have the cash for a long period of time, but weâ&#128;&#152;re not taking any interest-rate&#13;
risks on it, and we donâ&#128;&#152;t have to suffer any negative carry. And, by the way, what we can&#13;
then do is reallocate our capital to the loan book, and instead of investing the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
capital in the liquidity portfolio, we can invest it in the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s loans. And that has some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                            June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
other nice properties because it will ensure that over the long haul, if our capital is&#13;
invested in currencies and interest rates that mimic those of our loans, the critical&#13;
financial ratio of the Bank, which was the ratio of our capital to our loans, would be, in&#13;
effect, protected from volatility in interest rates and currencies over time because it was&#13;
invested in those loans. So we would, in effect, be holding it in the currencies and in the&#13;
interest rates that were equivalent to our loans.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
And, after all, since the big risk the Bank was taking was the credit risk on the loans, you&#13;
wanted to make sure your capital stayed consistent in terms of its ratio. And, by the way,&#13;
if you do thisâ&#128;&#148;this was the thinkingâ&#128;&#148;because of the way the currency pool was&#13;
structured, you were passing along to your borrowers a cost that did not factor in the non-&#13;
interest-bearing liabilities of the capital. So, in effect, what we ended up doing was&#13;
funding our loans about, you know, 75 to 80 percent in debt, 20 to 25 percent in capital.&#13;
The costs that were passing along to the borrowers was the cost of that 75 to 80 percent&#13;
that was funded with debt. We applied that to 100 percent of the charges on the loans.&#13;
And since we were getting no cost of funding on the capital, we were generating huge&#13;
profits on that, and because we were now investing our capital not in short-term&#13;
instruments but in the long-term instruments, we increased the earnings power of the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
There were these two schools of thought when I came into Treasury that were at odds&#13;
about how we should be managing the capital of the Bank and how we should be funding&#13;
the liquidity. And the difference between the two was probably hundreds of millions of&#13;
dollars of net income. And yet I sensed there was just sort of an agreement to disagree&#13;
among various and sundry leaders within the finance complex of the Bank. And I came in&#13;
and said, â&#128;&#149;Look, thereâ&#128;&#152;s no monopoly on truth here. I could argue for both of these&#13;
approaches based on whether or not my objective function is to minimize the market&#13;
evaluation of the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s equity or matching off capital against loans and so forth and so&#13;
on, but an agreement to disagree is not an acceptable way of running a bank.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Not when the difference between the two choices is hundreds of millions of&#13;
dollars.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Was this disagreement personal or intellectual, would you say?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: It was both. And it was very tied to personalities. And Jim was aware of the&#13;
debate, but I donâ&#128;&#152;t think it had ever been brought forward as something needing a&#13;
resolution and putting forth what the cost was. So I looked at it; I made a proposal;&#13;
ultimately this is the way we went. Again, to me the biggest improvement was that we&#13;
had a resolution of this very important issue, and we decided, â&#128;&#149;No, the appropriate thing&#13;
to do is to fund our liquidity with debt. We should investigate our capital in loans.â&#128;&#150; And&#13;
we made that transition. There was an historic cost that had been built in because we&#13;
couldnâ&#128;&#152;t pay down the extra long-term debt that we had outstanding, so we had what we&#13;
called a mortgage that needed to be paid down over a period of years. But at the same&#13;
&#13;
                                     Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                           June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
time, during the period of falling interest rates and very steep yield curves, we were able&#13;
to generate, I believe, substantial amounts of income for the Bank from the period of, say,&#13;
â&#128;&#151;97 onward because of this adjustment that we had made.&#13;
&#13;
More importantly, this was one of those areas where I believed that the Board had&#13;
absolutely no understanding of what the Bank was doing. Although there were papers&#13;
and discussions, my impression was that the Board simply didnâ&#128;&#152;t understand what the&#13;
choices were that were being made because (a) it was too complicated; (b) it always&#13;
raised questions of, â&#128;&#149;Well, you know, if we demonstrate to the borrowers that they are&#13;
paying a loan charge thatâ&#128;&#152;s based on a debt cost when in fact only 80 percent of their&#13;
loans are being funded with debt, theyâ&#128;&#152;re not getting the benefit of the non-interest-&#13;
bearing liabilities represented by the equity; maybe theyâ&#128;&#152;ll rebel and look to get lower&#13;
charges.â&#128;&#150; So I think there was a sense of this is something the Board owns because one&#13;
could probably see that there were reports, but I donâ&#128;&#152;t believe itâ&#128;&#152;s something the Board&#13;
ever really understood. I donâ&#128;&#152;t think the president of the Bank had ever been asked to&#13;
make this kind of decision. I found one exampleâ&#128;&#148;even in the investment portfolio, for&#13;
example, our whole investment strategy I donâ&#128;&#152;t think was owned by the Board.&#13;
&#13;
I was very nervous when I walked into Treasury because we reported on the performance&#13;
of our investment portfolio once a year, usually about three or four months after the year&#13;
ended. And the Board got this information. It was not clear to me what they did with it.&#13;
Now, when I looked at it, it was benchmarked against the one-year treasury. So when I&#13;
arrived as Treasurer, I said, â&#128;&#149;Could someone please show me our investment authority?â&#128;&#150;&#13;
And I looked at it, and it said we could invest out to a duration of four years, I think. And&#13;
I said, â&#128;&#149;Well, why do we benchmark ourselves against the one-year treasury?â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
And the answer was, â&#128;&#149;Well, this senior official was relatively risk-averse, so they said, â&#128;&#151;I&#13;
donâ&#128;&#152;t like four years; Iâ&#128;&#152;m going to do it in two.â&#128;&#152; And then, you know, the Treasurer was&#13;
even more risk-averse, so it went down from two to one.â&#128;&#150; And everybody thought this&#13;
was just the height of prudence, you know, that we were taking less risk.&#13;
&#13;
I felt as a Treasurer walking in, I said, â&#128;&#149;You know, someday the Boardâ&#128;&#152;s going to look at&#13;
me and say, â&#128;&#151;Mr. Perlin, do you realize the hundreds and millions of dollars youâ&#128;&#152;re&#13;
costing this Bank by choosing a one-year benchmark when we, the Board, gave you the&#13;
authority to invest out to four years?â&#128;&#152;â&#128;&#150; I said, â&#128;&#149;Iâ&#128;&#152;m sorry, that is notâ&#128;&#148;Iâ&#128;&#152;m not paid&#13;
enough as Treasurer to make that decision and to be held accountable.â&#128;&#150; I said, â&#128;&#149;Thatâ&#128;&#152;s a&#13;
Board choice.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
So, you know, we rewrote the liquidity policy of the Bank, had the Board approve it. We&#13;
started going to the Board with a quarterly Treasury report. And this was the third aspect&#13;
of what Jim had asked for, that didnâ&#128;&#152;t look just at the latest borrowing that got some&#13;
headline in the news, but we took a look at the overall balance sheet of the Bank. We&#13;
took a look at the liquidity of the Bank. We took a look at the funding structure of the&#13;
Bank on a balance sheet as well as a flow basis. And we went from having multiple&#13;
reports to the Board that to me seemed very spotty and selective and un-integrated and&#13;
moved to giving the Board one report per quarter, thatâ&#128;&#152;s it, that was a fully integrated&#13;
&#13;
                                     Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                           June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
report on the balance sheet position of the Bank which explained the funding strategy&#13;
rather than just describing the funding transactions that had taken place, many of which,&#13;
by the way, were very noteworthy, very market-leading. But the notion to me that&#13;
Treasury existed not to make a name for itself in bringing exciting new structures to&#13;
market but doing so in the service of meeting our balance sheet objectives, which&#13;
ultimately were all about serving our clients.&#13;
&#13;
These three changes to the nature of the product, the way we managed the capital&#13;
liquidity of the Bank, and we took a holistic view, I think it changed the Treasury for&#13;
good, and it is still operating in that way. And to me it was not a matter of having a&#13;
personal image of how things should run because historically (and probably going back&#13;
to the days of Gene Rotberg) the personality of the Treasurer had an awful lot to do with&#13;
the way things were run. It was simply bringing the Bank up to what I considered the&#13;
normal standard of a modern financial institution. And thatâ&#128;&#152;s the way itâ&#128;&#152;s operating now.&#13;
The products are market-based. The finances are very transparent&#13;
.&#13;
We also learned that, as I said, by 2002, after 9/11 and the ratcheting down of interest&#13;
rates, we went into a mild crisis in the Bank because although we had already had four or&#13;
five years of new loans being made on the new basis, we still had a holdover of the old&#13;
loans because they had twenty-year terms, many of them. And exactly what I had feared&#13;
was coming true, which was the likes of China and India, countries that either had market&#13;
access and/or growing foreign exchange reserves, started paying down their loans and&#13;
leaving those who were in the currency pool with a tremendous burden. So if you were in&#13;
the currency pool, or the old pool loans, even if theyâ&#128;&#152;d been converted to dollars at the&#13;
time of the new product offering, if you were a long-time borrower in pool loans, your&#13;
rate was not going down even though market rates had gone down hundreds and&#13;
hundreds of basis points. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s because rather than everybody staying in the pool and&#13;
the Bank over time refinancing and getting advantage of the lower rates, the pool was&#13;
shrinking. And the pool, in fact, was shrinking faster than the outstanding debt, which left&#13;
for the poorest of our borrowers, the least sophisticated, the least credit-worthy, those&#13;
with the least amount of alternatives, with the opportunity to refinance.&#13;
&#13;
Now, luckily we started changing when we did or there would have been a huge volume&#13;
of loans. And, as I said earlier, when the crisis came in Korea, which went from zero&#13;
incremental borrowing from the Bank to seven billion dollars in the course of a year, we&#13;
did not give them the option of going into the old currency pool. We said, â&#128;&#149;Look, weâ&#128;&#152;re&#13;
thinking of changing our product line, and weâ&#128;&#152;re going to force you to take something&#13;
thatâ&#128;&#152;s new because what we donâ&#128;&#152;t want to do is go out and borrow a whole bunch of&#13;
long-term money for you, Korea, because who knows? You guys could be out of a crisis&#13;
in two years. Youâ&#128;&#152;ll want to repay your loan, and weâ&#128;&#152;ll be stuck with the debt.â&#128;&#150; So it&#13;
turned out ex-post that we were very well advised to have made the change when we did.&#13;
But rather than having had perfect foresight, which of course we didnâ&#128;&#152;t have, about what&#13;
was going to happen to interest rates--but the real impetus for change was actually to deal&#13;
with the demands of borrowers during the good times of the early â&#128;&#151;90s, which was&#13;
pushing us to become more competitive. By having done so, we were much better&#13;
prepared for the crisis, as it turns out.&#13;
&#13;
                                    Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                          June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           43&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We also developed other techniques. I mean, funding liquidity with debt, we built up a&#13;
short-term funding capacity that the Bank never really was interested in because the&#13;
feeling was, â&#128;&#149;Well, for a long-term lender, why should we have short-term borrowings?&#13;
Thatâ&#128;&#152;s going to get us into trouble.â&#128;&#150; But once we said we were going to fund our liquidity&#13;
with short-term borrowingâ&#128;&#148;and I always felt that short-term borrowing in and of itself is&#13;
a potential source of liquidityâ&#128;&#148;we started to build up our short-term borrowing&#13;
programs, invested it in our liquidity portfolio, by and large generated positive returns&#13;
because our cost of borrowing was much less than that of LIBOR [London Interbank&#13;
Offered Rate] which we were investing in. And lo and behold, within six months the&#13;
funding needs of the Bank went up by something like $10 billion at the time of the Asia&#13;
crisis. We were in a position there of saying, â&#128;&#149;Well, look, we donâ&#128;&#152;t know from day to day&#13;
are we going to need another five billion, another ten billion? Is Korea going to make it?&#13;
Arenâ&#128;&#152;t they going to make it? I donâ&#128;&#152;t want to go out and borrow ten billion dollars of ten-&#13;
year money and then find six months from now that Korea doesnâ&#128;&#152;t borrow it because then&#13;
what am I going to do with it?â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
So I said, â&#128;&#149;No, no, no. Weâ&#128;&#152;re going to fund our liquidity with short-term borrowing. If&#13;
Korea demands the loan, weâ&#128;&#152;ll give them the loan, and at the time that the loan is made,&#13;
weâ&#128;&#152;ll refinance our borrowing to match the terms of theirs.â&#128;&#150; So it was (I think, in&#13;
retrospect) a very fortunate development that we had made ourselves very much more&#13;
modern in managing finances because it put us into a much better position of being able&#13;
to meet the needs of our borrowers. So thatâ&#128;&#152;s it.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, but this crisis in Southeast Asia starts July 1997, I think.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Thatâ&#128;&#152;s correct.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, what did the Bank thenâ&#128;&#148;more specifically, what did Treasury have&#13;
to do to face the crisis? I think youâ&#128;&#152;ve answered some of this already.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Sure. A lot of what we didâ&#128;&#148;and let me make a personal note if I might.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: In April of â&#128;&#151;97, Jessica Einhorn announcedâ&#128;&#148;I donâ&#128;&#152;t know if that was her&#13;
public announcement or her private announcement, but I think it was her public&#13;
announcement in 1997--she announced her intention to retire from the Bank, and she&#13;
announced her intention to move (and I think it was September of â&#128;&#152;97) to the IMF as a&#13;
visiting fellow for a year, which left us without the equivalent of a senior financial officer&#13;
of the Bank. In that time period, between April of â&#128;&#151;97 and my formal appointment as the&#13;
CFO in the December of â&#128;&#152;97 to February â&#128;&#152;98â&#128;&#148;I think February â&#128;&#151;98 was when it was&#13;
made officialâ&#128;&#148;I was the de facto CFO, even though that was a title that no one had ever&#13;
had at the Bank. And of course that was exactly the time that the crisis was hitting, so&#13;
there was really nobody between Jim and me on the finance side of the Bank because&#13;
Jessica had begun to exit. So what we did from the finance side of the Bank was to move&#13;
&#13;

                           June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
very quickly, as I say, to make sure we had the liquidity to be able to service our clients.&#13;
We developed the new products.&#13;
&#13;
Again, very quickly, from the back of an envelope, we created what was called the&#13;
Special Structural Adjustment Loan, the SSAL, at a number that I must tell you was&#13;
made up largely out of my head. We looked over at the IMF. They were lending to crisis&#13;
countries at 400 basis points over LIBOR. I said, â&#128;&#149;Look, if weâ&#128;&#152;re acting like the Fund,&#13;
weâ&#128;&#152;re going to charge like the Fund so thereâ&#128;&#152;s no adverse selection.â&#128;&#150; Our new loans, the&#13;
ones we made to Koreaâ&#128;&#148;actually we did the Korea loans before the SSAL because we&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#152;t know how much demand was coming after Korea--but with Korea, again, out of&#13;
the blue, we said, â&#128;&#149;LIBOR plus 100 basis points.â&#128;&#150; I mean, all of a sudden, again, from the&#13;
standpoint of a modern financial institution where pricing of a loan is a crucial aspect,&#13;
you know, the Bank never worried about it. The loan product was set. So we increased&#13;
the price; we forced them into a LIBOR base. We told them they had to take a floating&#13;
rate. And then it was when Argentina and Brazilâ&#128;&#148;because after the Asian crisis, then you&#13;
had the ricochet to Russia.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Russia in August of â&#128;&#151;98.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: In August of â&#128;&#151;98. And then into Latin America. And so for Russia, for&#13;
Brazil, for Argentina, we created this SSAL, again to try to reflect the fact that it was&#13;
much more short term. In other words, take a lending instrument and make it more&#13;
appropriately structured to a bridge loan through a crisis, and again to recognize that not&#13;
all loans forever from the World Bank should be twenty-year loans. I mean, we were&#13;
lending for road construction, which was a project that maybe had a ten-, fifteen-, or&#13;
twenty-year payback, a twenty-year loan was right. But in the midst of a crisis, you&#13;
know?&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Twenty years make no sense.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Twenty years makes no sense. We were financing major policy shifts which,&#13;
if they worked, should have had an immediate payback in terms of lower market spreads,&#13;
access to outside investors. Aside from just simple basic financial principles of Walter&#13;
Bagehot and everybody else, in a crisis you should be putting a premium price on it to&#13;
discourage too much borrowing and to encourage repayment and so forth and so on. A lot&#13;
of what we were doing through the course of â&#128;&#151;97 and into â&#128;&#151;98 was quickly changing the&#13;
products, quickly developing our Treasury capacity to meet all of those needs.&#13;
&#13;
And then only at that timeâ&#128;&#148;and, if youâ&#128;&#152;re willing, Iâ&#128;&#152;m going to segue into the next&#13;
phaseâ&#128;&#148;what we also discovered, of course, was that in addition to being able to fund and&#13;
manage and product develop on a dime, all of a sudden we also started to face questions&#13;
of, â&#128;&#149;Do we have enough capital to back the quantity and speed of lending that we were&#13;
doing, especially giving it in such concentrated amounts to just a few borrowers who&#13;
were all subject to the same risks, which was emerging market disaster?â&#128;&#150; So that really is&#13;
what started so much of what I did as chief financial officer, was saying, â&#128;&#149;Look, we know&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                           45&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
as a bank how to lend. We know how to borrow. Now, the real question is to whom and&#13;
how much?â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Can I ask you one question?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: One question you didnâ&#128;&#152;t mention was Indonesia. And if I recall, the Bank&#13;
was called on to step in there. I wonder if you could talk just a little bit about that because&#13;
Indonesia was, I thinkâ&#128;&#148;Korea came around pretty quickly and Indonesiaâ&#128;&#152;s still, I think,&#13;
pretty troubled.&#13;
&#13;
The one other question I have is, was there friction between the Bank and the IMF in any&#13;
of these areas?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Well, two things. First of all, on Indonesia, Indonesia was either the first or&#13;
second largest borrower. I think it was the largest single borrower of the IBRD when they&#13;
went into crisis. As a result, there was very little head room for the Bank to do much&#13;
additional borrowing, and because as a result of the incredible depreciation of the rupiah&#13;
during that crisis, they automatically became eligible again for IDA [International&#13;
Development Association]. So a lot of the lending started to come out of IDA, not the&#13;
Bank, and thatâ&#128;&#152;s why there wasnâ&#128;&#152;t a lot going on.&#13;
&#13;
In terms of the relationship with the Fund, yeah, there was definitely friction. And I think&#13;
the friction really came about because the Bank was being treated not only as the junior&#13;
partner in these crisis countries, which was very important, but very little regard was&#13;
being given to the fact that the Fund and the Bank had fundamentally different missions&#13;
and (of course, from my standpoint) fundamentally different financial structures. So if&#13;
you thought about it--and of course Jim had conversations with his counterparts in the&#13;
Fund as well--they were designed to be able to put huge amounts of funding into crisis&#13;
countries all at once. They werenâ&#128;&#152;t dependent on market funding, so they didnâ&#128;&#152;t need to&#13;
worry about concentration risk the way we did. They didnâ&#128;&#152;t need to worry about ramping&#13;
up their lending overnight, which is something that would cause any market to have&#13;
concern about a financial institution. And so I think the biggest concern that we had was&#13;
the Fund at the time seemed to have a penchant for coming up with very large packages,&#13;
where the number in the package that the Bank and the Fund and the regional&#13;
development banks, wherever they might be, that this was going to be twenty billion or a&#13;
thirty billion or a forty billion dollar package. The notion was the bigger the number the&#13;
less likely the funding would be needed because the market would all of a sudden take&#13;
comfort from the fact that there was all of this cash coming in.&#13;
&#13;
Of course, over time that didnâ&#128;&#152;t work very well because the market said, â&#128;&#149;Itâ&#128;&#152;s not the&#13;
quantity of the lending program, thank you, itâ&#128;&#152;s the quality.â&#128;&#150; And so what was happening&#13;
was the Bank was sort of getting circled up for being, you know, in a country like Brazil&#13;
or Argentina or wherever, the Fund wanted to make an announcement where they were&#13;
looking for the Bank to put five or six or seven billion dollars into a lending program&#13;
&#13;
                                     Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                           June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           46&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
over a period of three years that in many ways was beyond what we were prepared to&#13;
lend and, by definition, the development of the projects and programs that would merit&#13;
the kind of lending the Bank would make. You know, we had no idea whether that would&#13;
occur or not. So we ended up sort of word-smithing a lot of the press releases to be&#13;
consistent with what the Fund and to some extent the U.S. really wanted us to do. But Jim&#13;
himself used to talk at the Board about, you know, â&#128;&#149;I donâ&#128;&#152;t like getting these midnight&#13;
calls from the Secretary of the Treasury or the head of IMF saying, â&#128;&#151;Weâ&#128;&#152;re going to circle&#13;
you up for two billion or three billion or four billion.â&#128;&#152;â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
Now, in fact Korea was probably the only place where we really acted that way because&#13;
we put in about seven billion dollars in six months. And, yes, it was associated with some&#13;
reform programs in the public sector, financial institutions, and the like, but it was, in a&#13;
sense, a lot of mission diffusion between the Bank and the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What about Thailand? Was the Bank heavily involved in Thailand or not,&#13;
or was that mainly the Fund?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Both were involved. It was more Fund than it was Bank. And part of it was&#13;
that the tiesâ&#128;&#148;there probably was really aâ&#128;&#148;they had a macro problem, both because of&#13;
the currency inflexibility, and then they also had a sectoral problem which was the over-&#13;
investment of the banking sector in real estate and into some of the electronics industries&#13;
that were suffering from oversupply and so forth and so on. So the Thais, once they kind&#13;
of dealt with those macro problems, they really didnâ&#128;&#152;t need a lot of what the Bank had to&#13;
offer. And I think in some cases--because the Fund was always early in, whether it was&#13;
Korea or Thailand, and because there was such backlash in the countries against the&#13;
Fund--I think those countries were very anxious to get the multi-laterals out as quickly as&#13;
they could. So even though there had been probably much better historical relationships&#13;
with the Bank, in some senses we might have been sort of grouped together.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, you suffered from the hostility.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: I think thatâ&#128;&#152;s true to some extent. But even though behind the scenes I&#13;
believe there were much more cordial relationships with many of our borrowers: they&#13;
appreciated the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s approach; they knew that we had a long-term perspective; we&#13;
were never as dictatorial as the Fund. Now, some people may have seen that,&#13;
legitimately, as a weakness of the Bank, you know, that we werenâ&#128;&#152;t sufficiently&#13;
committed to discipline, when in fact it was really more of a focus on long-term&#13;
development efforts, be they infrastructure projects or social interests or whatever the&#13;
case might be.&#13;
&#13;
I think we justâ&#128;&#148;it was a frustration of mind, of mind that, while there was lots of dialog&#13;
over that period of timeâ&#128;&#148;and youâ&#128;&#152;ll remember that was when there was bad blood&#13;
between Joe [Joseph E.] Stiglitz and the Fund and so forth and so on. People kept saying,&#13;
â&#128;&#149;Well, you know, thereâ&#128;&#152;s such mission diffusion and confusion between these&#13;
institutions.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                          June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           47&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It was an attempt on my part, which was quite unsuccessful, to try and say to people,&#13;
â&#128;&#149;You know, why donâ&#128;&#152;t we just remember what the financial structure of these two&#13;
institutions is? And why donâ&#128;&#152;t we use that as a guide to what institution should be doing&#13;
versus the other one because at the end of the day we need to be able to structure our&#13;
programs and our activities to be consistent with our finances? And I think it would help&#13;
a lot to do that,â&#128;&#150; whereas most of the dialog was, â&#128;&#149;Well, no, the financial sector is mine.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
â&#128;&#149;No, itâ&#128;&#152;s yours!â&#128;&#150; â&#128;&#149;Itâ&#128;&#152;s mine.â&#128;&#150; (Anything with the word â&#128;&#149;financeâ&#128;&#150; in it, the IMF thought&#13;
they owned.) â&#128;&#149;But wait a second, what about long-term restructuring of the banking&#13;
sector or improvement to the quality of supervision of the banks? Now thatâ&#128;&#152;s a long-term&#13;
exercise. That should be Bank because itâ&#128;&#152;s long term versus short term. Or, you know,&#13;
who should set the conditions around the lending if both institutions were going to be&#13;
contributing to it?â&#128;&#150; I felt we missed an opportunity because we still didnâ&#128;&#152;t, as an&#13;
institution, think of ourselves as a financial institution. We never quite married all of that&#13;
up, although I think we ended up at least maintaining our responsibilities as a financial&#13;
institution.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So you moved actuallyâ&#128;&#148;you said in February 1998, after Einhorn had left.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Yes. And after about eight to ten months of de facto serving in that role.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right. And so thereâ&#128;&#152;s a new position really as chief financial officer.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Right.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Talk a little bit about how that came about and how you ended up being the&#13;
first CFO.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Well, it was very interesting. I went to Jim early on and said, â&#128;&#149;Jim, I donâ&#128;&#152;t&#13;
need to be the CFO of this Bank, but I canâ&#128;&#152;t be Treasurer if somebody isnâ&#128;&#152;t CFO because&#13;
I can make sure that we have funding. I canâ&#128;&#152;t make sure that we have a reasonable&#13;
balance sheet strategy. But there are still issues that I cannot get resolved, and I have no&#13;
one to go to to get them resolved.â&#128;&#150; Also, I had the sense that we were also coming up&#13;
against an absolutely new level of concern at the Bank that had never existed before,&#13;
which is there was a possibility that the Bank was going to run out of financial capacity&#13;
to meet its clientsâ&#128;&#152; demands.&#13;
&#13;
Iâ&#128;&#152;m not convinced that at any time in the history of the Bank was there ever a situation&#13;
where the effective demand, the projects that the Bank was willing to approve, ever&#13;
outstripped the financial capacity of the Bank to finance. Now there were a couple of&#13;
times during the history where there was a regulatory limit because of the need to have&#13;
callable capital to support the lending to make sure that the one-to-one ratio between&#13;
loans and capital had not been violated. But there was never a situation in which the Bank&#13;
as an ongoing financial institution, since it could never use the callable capitalâ&#128;&#148;I mean,&#13;
that was a doomsday kind of instrument; it needed to use the on-balance sheet capital--&#13;
never was it forced to take so much risk that it couldnâ&#128;&#152;t support it. Until 1998! The Bank,&#13;

                           June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           48&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
between the decline of the creditworthiness of our outstanding borrowers like Indonesia,&#13;
plus the huge demands coming over the transom for large amounts of new loans in a&#13;
concentrated form to individual borrowers--and so the Bank, never having had to have&#13;
made a financial decision where there was a clear trade-off, needed to start making those&#13;
changes. And I went to Jim and saidâ&#128;&#148;not as a matter of personal advancement, but&#13;
simply a case needed to be madeâ&#128;&#148;â&#128;&#149;There needs to be someone in this role to chair the&#13;
Assets and Liabilities Committee, to represent to the Board what the financial limits of&#13;
the institutions were, to recognize the importance of the interrelationship between IBRD&#13;
and IDA in many of these countries,â&#128;&#150; that it was a job that needed doing.&#13;
&#13;
There had been at the timeâ&#128;&#148;there was only one other senior vice president at the time;&#13;
that was Mr. Shihata. And there was this new title at the Bank from several years back&#13;
called Managing Director. And I said to Jim, â&#128;&#149;Look, I have no interest in being a&#13;
Managing Director of the Bank, which would require that I spend lots of time as a&#13;
member of your council looking at all issues around the Bank, budget and personnel, Iâ&#128;&#152;m&#13;
not interested in that. But we need a senior officer of this Bank whoâ&#128;&#152;s accountable for the&#13;
finances.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
And he at that time, I believe, wanted also to beef up the financial sector capacity,&#13;
financial sector operations capacity of the Bank, and he had in his mind that he was&#13;
hoping to bring in a Managing Director, and ultimately he did. And I think all along he&#13;
knew it was probably going to be Jeffrey Goldstein, who had been an associate of his&#13;
previously. He wanted to keep that Managing Director slot open.&#13;
&#13;
So there was a real meeting of interests and needs of the institution. And I think of Jim&#13;
and I as individuals that I felt we needed a senior financial officer of the Bank, but&#13;
somebody who would truly be a senior line official and not somebody in the office of the&#13;
chairman. And so thatâ&#128;&#152;s how the job got created. And again, it wasnâ&#128;&#152;t much different than&#13;
the job that I had been doing since Jessica left, but I had been doing it without a clear&#13;
recognition of that role and responsibility.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So what was the firstâ&#128;&#148;I think I know the answer to thisâ&#128;&#148;but what was the&#13;
first thing that hit you with your new title?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: I mean, the first thing that hit me because of the timing (because it was early&#13;
â&#128;&#152;98) was dealing with a Board that truly had never dealt with issues like how much&#13;
lending could it afford to do? What was its capital requirement? The Bank did not have a&#13;
regulator like most banks do. The Board was the regulator of the Bank. But, of course,&#13;
thatâ&#128;&#152;s truly a conflict of interest because the Board is also interested in both protecting the&#13;
taxpayers of the sponsoring countries and at the same time the Board was trying to&#13;
represent the interests of their governments to make sure that the Bank responded to all of&#13;
these crises. And so you had a Board that was encouraging risk-taking on the part of the&#13;
Bank who was also responsible for the risk management of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
And so I did an awful lot of work the first year tryingâ&#128;&#148;and I spent a ton of time with the&#13;
Board. I mean, I may have spent more time with the Board than any other senior official&#13;

                           June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       49&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
of the Bank (save the secretary) because they started to understand that as fiduciaries of&#13;
the Bank as well as representatives of their government that they were being asked to&#13;
make decisions that were putting the Bank financially at risk without a clear sense of how&#13;
to measure it and how to manage it. And again, there were papers that had been written&#13;
that the Board sort of nodded and said, â&#128;&#149;Yes, yes, yesâ&#128;&#150; to, that some people in the Bank&#13;
said, â&#128;&#149;Well, we know what the risk appetite of the Bank is.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
And I said, â&#128;&#149;Iâ&#128;&#152;m sorry. The Board doesnâ&#128;&#152;t own that risk appetite. They never understood&#13;
it because they never had to make a constrained decision.â&#128;&#150; And so much of my focus for&#13;
that year was in making sure that the Board owned the risk appetite of the Bank. That&#13;
allowed us to be able to say, â&#128;&#149;Look, when the Fund comes calling, when the treasury&#13;
secretary of the United States comes calling and says, â&#128;&#151;We need you to put five billion&#13;
dollars into country X or Y overnight,â&#128;&#152; our answer has to be, â&#128;&#151;We can afford to put in&#13;
two. Or, if you want us to put in five, hereâ&#128;&#152;s how much more capital youâ&#128;&#152;re going to have&#13;
to put into the Bank in order for us to do this.â&#128;&#152;â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
And because of the time period, we had already seen this huge increase in demand. It was&#13;
during the time of the Russian crisis, Argentina, Brazil. We already had seven billion&#13;
leave the Bank to go to Korea. We had increasing risk in Indonesia and in a couple of&#13;
other borrowers, the Bank Philippines and so forth and so on.&#13;
&#13;
And so that first year was really all about: What is the financial structure of the Bank?&#13;
What is the capital adequacy of the Bank? How can we respond to these crises? Because&#13;
the sense was the demand is going to increase at an exponential rate at the same time that&#13;
the risks on our balance sheet were increasing at an exponential rate. because guess what?&#13;
The history of the Bank, which had always been countries moving steadily and uni-&#13;
directionally up the credit curve so that the time they had maximum exposure to the Bank&#13;
was the time they were really becoming credit worthy and graduating, all of a sudden&#13;
they were coming back and asking for more when we already had a huge exposure to&#13;
them and where our risk exposure was growing because what was a mildly risky&#13;
exposure one year, within six months was becoming a hugely risky exposure, not because&#13;
of a change in us but because of a change in the market and a change in the relationship&#13;
of those borrowers to the market.&#13;
&#13;
That is what culminated in our inviting in a number of distinguished outside experts&#13;
whom we called the â&#128;&#149;Wise Men.â&#128;&#150; We started out with three; we ended up withâ&#128;&#148;did we&#13;
end up with three or four? It was four. It was Bill [William J.] McDonough, whoâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
president of the New York Fed. It was Andrew Crockett, head of the BIS, the Bank for&#13;
International Settlements. It was Marc Vinot, who was the retired chairman of Aventis.&#13;
And I felt it was important that we have someone from a developing country, and we got&#13;
Mr. [Narayanan] Vaghul, V-A-G-H-U-L, the recently retired chairman of the ICICI&#13;
[Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India], one of the biggest financial&#13;
companies in India. And we basically said, â&#128;&#149;We donâ&#128;&#152;t have a regulator. We would like&#13;
you to opine as to the appropriateness of our capital adequacy framework, which is going&#13;
to be endorsed by our Board.â&#128;&#150; So that in a sense . .&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: But you brought them in, not the Board?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Jim brought them in. The Board did not. And I think it was, again, it was&#13;
how I operated a lot with Jim. I did not crave a lot of face time with Jim. In fact, I felt&#13;
that the less time I spent with him the better, but make sure that the time I spent with him&#13;
was highly conclusive.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Productive.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: And so, you know, Jimâ&#128;&#148;it was typical, quintessential Jim Wolfensohn:&#13;
â&#128;&#149;If Iâ&#128;&#152;ve got a client,â&#128;&#150; meaning the Board, â&#128;&#149;that isnâ&#128;&#152;t quite sure where to go, Iâ&#128;&#152;m going to&#13;
go out and call some of my very well-known friends and bring them in and say, â&#128;&#151;Letâ&#128;&#152;s get&#13;
advice from the best in the world.â&#128;&#152;â&#128;&#150; It was vintage Wolfensohn. It was a great idea. I had&#13;
to execute it, but it was a great idea!&#13;
&#13;
And again, I didnâ&#128;&#152;t need to talk to Jim a lot. I mean, I had him chair the meetings. But all&#13;
the work was done in the background. I mean I spent time at the BIS and so forth and so&#13;
on, and it was, â&#128;&#149;Letâ&#128;&#152;s get it real clear, guys. What is the framework of the Bank?â&#128;&#150;&#13;
Because imagine trying to run a bank at the edge of its risk-taking capacity without a&#13;
clearly defined regulatory regime. It canâ&#128;&#152;t happen. And so the whole first year really was&#13;
devoted to solving this particular issue. Of course, it was also during that time period that&#13;
the crisis dialed back significantly. I mean, Russia never hit the skids the way we thought&#13;
it was because of the oil price coming back up.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Brazil didnâ&#128;&#152;t . . .&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Brazil didnâ&#128;&#152;t crater; Argentina didnâ&#128;&#152;t crater, you know, frankly, at that time.&#13;
And again, it was the sort of manic nature of the emerging markets that turned around on&#13;
the dime.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And so just as sort of an entrÃ©e--and then we change the tape--itâ&#128;&#152;s sort of an&#13;
entrÃ©e to, well, what was your second year like, Gary?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: I mean, the second year was, okay, the risks on our existing exposures&#13;
started to come down. The demands werenâ&#128;&#152;t materializing the way we thought they were&#13;
going to materialize, so now we no longer need to push for more capital. And my answer&#13;
was, â&#128;&#149;Well, look, guys, youâ&#128;&#152;re right. But please understand that what we got out of this&#13;
yearâ&#128;&#152;s experience was a recognition of the limit, and that as long as the demand doesnâ&#128;&#152;t&#13;
materialize we no longer are in a position to have to ask you for more capital.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
 There was a time during the Wise Menâ&#128;&#152;s discussion that most people assumedâ&#128;&#148;and&#13;
some shareholders were actually saying, â&#128;&#149;Well, donâ&#128;&#152;t you think you should be asking for&#13;
more capital?â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
Now, part of our problem was that we knew that most of our major shareholders werenâ&#128;&#152;t&#13;
interested in giving us capital. And I said, â&#128;&#149;Look, guys, I cannot face the debt markets at&#13;
&#13;
                                     Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                           June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           51&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
a time where I go to my shareholders and ask for capital and they say no. This is a&#13;
question I canâ&#128;&#152;t ask unless I know the answer is yes.â&#128;&#150; And so while the likes of the&#13;
Netherlands and Belgium and Austria and so forth said, â&#128;&#149;Right on! Ask for more capital.&#13;
Weâ&#128;&#152;re willing to contribute,â&#128;&#150; the answer is, â&#128;&#149;Not unless you get the big guys willing to do&#13;
it.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
And the problem I had was that in speaking to our major shareholders, they said, â&#128;&#149;Well,&#13;
first of all, the crisis is over; secondly, the demand hasnâ&#128;&#152;t materialized, and so we think&#13;
you can get on.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
My answer was, â&#128;&#149;Look, I do not consider it a failure on my part that Iâ&#128;&#152;m not getting more&#13;
capital from you. As long as youâ&#128;&#152;ve learned that when things turn back the other way--&#13;
because thatâ&#128;&#152;s how markets are, and for better or worse now that most of our borrowers&#13;
are dependent on the market it will come backâ&#128;&#148;as long as you are willing to calibrate&#13;
your demand on the Bank to meet our capacity to deliver, then we have achieved our&#13;
goal.â&#128;&#150; Because at the end of the day, if we arenâ&#128;&#152;t going to be called upon to take the risk&#13;
and put in the money that we thought might have been the case had we simply&#13;
extrapolated the experience of â&#128;&#151;97, â&#128;&#151;98 into the future, then maybe we donâ&#128;&#152;t need extra&#13;
capital.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, did the Wise Men actually issue a report?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Yes, they did. It was a report to the Board, so it was not a public report.&#13;
Actually, I found a draft of it; I didnâ&#128;&#152;t find the final one in my records. But itâ&#128;&#152;s a Board&#13;
document. Youâ&#128;&#152;d find it . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, the Archives would have it.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: . . in the Archives. If I had to guess, I would say it was March 17, 1999, but I&#13;
canâ&#128;&#152;t be more than two or three weeks off.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. March 1999.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 2, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 2, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: So, effectively, what weâ&#128;&#152;re talking about is again these very rapid changes&#13;
from big crisis to sunshine to â&#128;&#149;Whoever thought there was a crisis kind of situation?â&#128;&#150;&#13;
Korea started paying back its loans very quickly. The demands never materialized from&#13;
places like Brazil and Argentina, partially because they didnâ&#128;&#152;t need the money, although&#13;
partially because since they didnâ&#128;&#152;t need the money they werenâ&#128;&#152;t really willing to do the&#13;
work to make the projects happen that weâ&#128;&#152;d originally thought, plus some of the loans&#13;
that were made to countries like Brazil and Argentina were on these SL [sustainable&#13;
livelihood] terms, and they were actually anxious to pay down those SLs and get some&#13;
regular lending.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                           June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         52&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And so â&#128;&#151;99, 2000, things really started to kind of improve for the Bank. And yet what I&#13;
tried to do during that time period was to really consolidate the gains we had made in&#13;
terms of understanding on the part of our shareholders, our Board, as to how the finances&#13;
of the Bank worked. So we did a lot of presentations, some of which Iâ&#128;&#152;ve given you, to&#13;
explain to them: How does the Bank make its money? What is the limitation in terms of&#13;
the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s capacity? We started to do a lot of presentations to the Board that were&#13;
informal. We took advantage of a new room that was built down on the second floor&#13;
where we had four screens simultaneously showing with spreadsheets up on them. And&#13;
we ran them through various and sundry models, where we would say, â&#128;&#149;Well, letâ&#128;&#152;s shock&#13;
the portfolio. Letâ&#128;&#152;s send Argentina and Brazil into non-accrual and see what happens.&#13;
What happens to the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s risk-bearing capacity? How much capital do we need?&#13;
Whatâ&#128;&#152;s the potential loss that the Bank might take? Would the Bank be able to come back&#13;
from that kind of a situation, recognizing that our shareholders at a time of great distress&#13;
for developing countries want us to be part of the solution, not part of the problem? What&#13;
if we assumed, you know, that we increased the budget of the Bank or we decreased the&#13;
lending?â&#128;&#150; And weâ&#128;&#152;d show them how it all worked.&#13;
&#13;
The Board actually was quite interested in all of this. Quite frankly, I think the Board was&#13;
more interested than most of management, simply because most of management was so&#13;
focused on dealing with the countries and working on the projects that managing the&#13;
finances of the Bank as a whole really wasnâ&#128;&#152;t in anybodyâ&#128;&#152;s line of sight other than mine.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: But if the Board began to develop a sense of its fiduciary responsibility,&#13;
then obviously they would be interested in this kind of thing.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Absolutely. And again, it was their fiduciary responsibility, but it was also a&#13;
matter of not just being good fiduciaries of the Bank (because itâ&#128;&#152;s always tough for them&#13;
to act that way) but also to be able to explain to their governments, â&#128;&#149;Boy, if the crisis&#13;
comes back, how much are we going to be able to support?â&#128;&#150; We did this, by the way,&#13;
immediately after 9/11, you know. And the question was, â&#128;&#149;Whew! Whatâ&#128;&#152;s the effect?&#13;
Whatâ&#128;&#152;s going to happen? You know whatâ&#128;&#152;s happening to the bond markets and to the&#13;
stock markets. Whatâ&#128;&#152;s going to happen to the emerging markets? Do we have the&#13;
capacity, as again the Bank developed highly concentrated exposures to just a few&#13;
countries?â&#128;&#150; A simple downgrading of a country, even if it didnâ&#128;&#152;t go into non-accrual,&#13;
could have a big impact on the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s reported income and the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s capacity to&#13;
support its borrowers. So it was a time of really consolidating their knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
And some things really started to occur. I think people at the Board in particular started to&#13;
see the fact that, â&#128;&#149;Gosh, if the Bank had multiple mechanisms for supporting developing&#13;
countries, it had knowledge, it had economic development work, things that require the&#13;
expenditure of administrative budget, that, well, maybe thereâ&#128;&#152;s a trade-off between a&#13;
dollar that might go to the administrative budget and a dollar that could go into the capital&#13;
base of the Bank that could be then leveraged 5 to 1 in terms of lending.â&#128;&#150; And you started&#13;
to say, or you could say, â&#128;&#149;Well, no, no, that dollar should be given to IDAâ&#128;&#150; or â&#128;&#149;That&#13;
dollar should be given to HIPC [Heavily Indebted Poor Countries].â&#128;&#150; So all of a sudden, if&#13;
you stepped back and say, â&#128;&#149;You know, I have this structure of an institution, and at the&#13;
&#13;
                                     Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                           June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        53&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
end of the day the Board on an annual basis in making its decisions about how to allocate&#13;
its income, where should that income go,â&#128;&#150; you sort of say, â&#128;&#149;Well, boy, that seems to be&#13;
one of my biggest decisions as a Board member. And I need to know, well, how much&#13;
needs to go into the reserves of the Bank, which is a matter of fiduciary concern and&#13;
potential future lending? How much can I give away as grants? How much can I use to&#13;
increase or decrease the administrative budget of the Bank?â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
The Board was quite distressed that there was seldom a time that they talked about things&#13;
like the income of the Bank and the expenditures of the Bank at the same time. And itâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
something that Jim Wolfensohn said very early on, coming from the private sector, you&#13;
know, â&#128;&#149;How can we be having a conversation about our budget separate from a&#13;
conversation about our income?â&#128;&#150; And so we started to move the Board consideration of&#13;
the administrative budget and the financial review of the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s capacity and the&#13;
allocation of income, so even if they didnâ&#128;&#152;t take place simultaneously, they all took place&#13;
within a month or two of each other so that all of the information was on the table.&#13;
&#13;
We switched again. We revamped the way we reported to the Board. It used to be that the&#13;
Board talked about the finances of the Bank once a year, and that was typically at the end&#13;
of July, the beginning of August, their last meeting before the summer recess, where they&#13;
were asked to approve the financial statements of the Bank (which were as of June 30&#13;
because that was the end of the fiscal year), needed to be approved before they went on&#13;
August recess because if not, we wouldnâ&#128;&#152;t have been able to publish the annual report of&#13;
the Bank, which of course had to be ready for the annual meetings in September.&#13;
.&#13;
So I used to say the Board all the time, you know, â&#128;&#149;Please understand that we close the&#13;
books and get them audited at the World Bank within three weeks of the close of the&#13;
fiscal year.â&#128;&#150; You canâ&#128;&#152;t find a bank on Godâ&#128;&#152;s earth thatâ&#128;&#152;s able to do that because--I mean&#13;
most banks have a fiscal year that ends December 31st. Their annual stockholdersâ&#128;&#152;&#13;
meeting is in April. We close our books on the 30th of June, and we have our annual&#13;
meeting in September, and we lose our Board to the summer recess at the beginning of&#13;
August.&#13;
&#13;
So, you know, it was sort of the last day where they were going off on recess that we&#13;
asked them to approve the allocation of the net income of the Bank and of course, in the&#13;
day where there was never really a constraint because it was more or less politics but it&#13;
was not a matter of where thereâ&#128;&#152;s a finite amount that can be used, all of a sudden, after&#13;
1998, 1999, they needed to understand, â&#128;&#149;Well, whatâ&#128;&#152;s the capital situation of the Bank?&#13;
And whatâ&#128;&#152;s the risk position of the Bank?â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
And so we started to move into sort of the March-April framework a mid-termâ&#128;&#148;what we&#13;
called a medium-term financial outlook reviewâ&#128;&#148;and said, â&#128;&#149;No, no. Your time to have&#13;
your really deep discussion about the financial future of the Bank is not when youâ&#128;&#152;re&#13;
signing off on the financial statements and allocating the income. Itâ&#128;&#152;s got to be three&#13;
months before that so that we can begin the process of developing a consensus around&#13;
how we should allocate the income of the Bank, because if we donâ&#128;&#152;t develop the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                          June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        54&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
consensus starting in April, thereâ&#128;&#152;s no way weâ&#128;&#152;re going to get resolution at the end of&#13;
July because this is going to be contentious.â&#128;&#150; And we needed to socialize the situation.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What were the sources of contention?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Well, you know, when you think about it, I mean the use of the income of&#13;
the Bank was, first, it was supposed to go to reserves because I think even in our charter&#13;
it said first call on the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s net income is to solidify the financial soundness of the&#13;
Bank. It never told you how much or how you were supposed to calculate it.&#13;
&#13;
Thatâ&#128;&#152;s when we started using all of these techniques that we had vetted by the Wise Men&#13;
to say, â&#128;&#149;Well, hereâ&#128;&#152;s how we calculate how much. What is the minimum amount of&#13;
capital we need?â&#128;&#150; And guess what? In several years we werenâ&#128;&#152;t ableâ&#128;&#148;we didnâ&#128;&#152;t have&#13;
enough capital to meet it. So we said, â&#128;&#149;Well, but over time we think we will.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
And so the Board had to come along and say, â&#128;&#149;Well, Iâ&#128;&#152;m signing off on using income for&#13;
something other than reserves when the reserves arenâ&#128;&#152;t adequate.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
And we said, â&#128;&#149;Well, look, over a three-year time period you can do this.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
So there was a use for reinvestment in the Bank. There was a use of funds to give to IDA&#13;
and to give to HIPC. Then there were, of course, other things. In the Former Republic of&#13;
Yugoslavia, reconciliation and reconstruction funding. Or East Timor or West Bank and&#13;
Gaza or capacity-building in Africa. Grant-making, if you will. And, of course,&#13;
historically the Bank always had enough funds to make grants because the risks that it&#13;
was protected against never materialized because all of our borrowers always were uni-&#13;
directional. They were always becoming more creditworthy. So we always had kind of&#13;
leftover funds.&#13;
&#13;
So all of a sudden, you know, you had countries from Africa wanting to make sure we&#13;
gave enough to IDA and to HIPC. And then we had the countries from Latin America&#13;
and East Asia who were saying, â&#128;&#149;No, no, no. The money should be going into the&#13;
reserves of the Bank so itâ&#128;&#152;s there in case we need to borrow. And by the way, if you think&#13;
you have so much extra money, if youâ&#128;&#152;re going to give it away to IDA and HIPC, thatâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
the medium-income countries subsidizing the poor countries. The Bank is paying the cost&#13;
of what the rich countries should be paying out of their budgets not out of the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
income.â&#128;&#150; And so they said, â&#128;&#149;No, no. If thereâ&#128;&#152;s extra money in the Bank, you should be&#13;
giving us a rebate on our interest costs.â&#128;&#150; So you had to dance around this allocation of&#13;
income, some of which would go to IDA and HIPC, some of which would go to give&#13;
rebates or waivers on interest charges, some of which would go back into the grant-&#13;
making capacity of the Bank, and some of which would have to go into reserves. And the&#13;
one thing that we could always get that was always non-contentious was if we said itâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
going to get reinvested in the Bank, no one ever said boo!&#13;
&#13;
But once you gave it to one set of constituents, immediately the Board started acting not&#13;
as fiduciaries of the Bank but as representatives of their constituencies, and saying,&#13;
&#13;
                                    Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                          June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          55&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#149;Well, look, if youâ&#128;&#152;re going to start divvying up the goodies, I want to make sure that Iâ&#128;&#152;m&#13;
getting it.â&#128;&#150; And so it was really very important because we had one sessionâ&#128;&#148;and I&#13;
believe it was â&#128;&#152;97, the income-allocation discussion in â&#128;&#152;97â&#128;&#148;which included, as I recall, a&#13;
price increase on loans of 25 basis points. It was the only time in my history at the Bank&#13;
that I ever saw roll call votes at the Board. I mean literally roll call votes at the Board&#13;
around income-allocation decisions. And, quite frankly, they were close. They were like&#13;
60-40. It was a dangerous thing, I felt. And once I saw it happen onceâ&#128;&#148;and I wasnâ&#128;&#152;t&#13;
officially the CFO yet; it was sort of a swan song for Jessica, whoâ&#128;&#152;d already announced&#13;
her departureâ&#128;&#148;I said, â&#128;&#149;Look, what this Bank relies upon is the consensus of the Board to&#13;
the financial strength of the institution, and taking votes like this are not acceptable.â&#128;&#150; And&#13;
I vowed then I was never going to have an income allocation discussion which would&#13;
come down to a Board vote because I felt it would threaten the financial standing of the&#13;
Bank if a rating agency ever heard that 40 percent of the vote went against adding to&#13;
reserves. I mean, weâ&#128;&#152;d be in big trouble.&#13;
&#13;
And so over time I took greatâ&#128;&#147;I used as my metric of success the degree of consensus at&#13;
the time of income allocation, meaning that the Board understood the risk position of the&#13;
Bank, they understood what the Bank needed in terms of capital, and that we came up&#13;
with a reasonably consensual allocation of the balance of the resources. And increasingly&#13;
they also wanted to see where the budget was coming from as well. So, in fact, we&#13;
created something called an Integrated Resources Framework which started showing up&#13;
in the strategic paper that went to the Board in March which was sort of the kickoff for&#13;
the budget season as well, where they said, â&#128;&#149;No, no, no. We want to see the whole&#13;
picture, not just the admin budget. We want to see whatâ&#128;&#152;s happening to our capital, we&#13;
want to see whatâ&#128;&#152;s happening to our income, we want to know what youâ&#128;&#152;re going to do&#13;
with the income because we have a great interest in seeing all this happen.â&#128;&#150; And&#13;
increasingly what they also wanted to see was the interplay between IBRD and IDA&#13;
because they understood, â&#128;&#149;Look, IDA charges our financing more than a third,â&#128;&#150; and it got&#13;
close to half, maybe over half by now, based on the formula IDA charges are paying for&#13;
the admin expenses of the Bank, â&#128;&#149;but then again, the Bank turns around and gives them&#13;
300 million of a grant as part of IDA replenishments and then thereâ&#128;&#152;s IDA and then&#13;
thereâ&#128;&#152;s HIPC.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
And then the final piece of the puzzle--just kind of fast-forwarding to 2003 by which time&#13;
again, with the sole exception of Argentina, the demands on the Bank were going way&#13;
down because countries were getting access to markets and for a variety of reasons, you&#13;
know, things like Indonesia becoming more creditworthy and so forth--all of a sudden&#13;
there was this sort of riches of capital in the Bank. And again, it was a test, I felt, of&#13;
saying, â&#128;&#149;Look, guys, in this kind of market environment, it is okay for this Bank to be&#13;
â&#128;&#151;over-capitalizedâ&#128;&#152; today because please remember the experience of the last five years;&#13;
overnight that can swing in the other direction. If two or three countries get into trouble,&#13;
and we get this double hit that our exposure becomes riskier and the demand for&#13;
additional funding becomes higher, you really have to put all this together.â&#128;&#150; And so it&#13;
was an issue that was very important.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                           June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            56&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And then the other issue, of course, was that people started saying, â&#128;&#149;Well, wait a second.&#13;
If all of the lending demand can go from hyper levels of 1998 to very low levels of 2002,&#13;
2003 in particular,â&#128;&#150; theyâ&#128;&#152;d say, â&#128;&#149;well, whatâ&#128;&#152;s the future of the Bank? The Bank doesnâ&#128;&#152;t&#13;
make as many loans as it used to; is it going to be able to generate enough earnings to be&#13;
able to do all of these things?â&#128;&#150; We had to resolve this question of the old currency pool&#13;
getting bought down. And then we had all sorts of questions of, â&#128;&#149;Well, you know, again,&#13;
if IDA goes to grants, whoâ&#128;&#152;s going to pay the freight here?â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Over the long term.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: Over the long term. Many of the countries, a lot of Middle Eastern countries,&#13;
at least their representatives on the Board, said, you know, â&#128;&#149;This Bank is in trouble. Any&#13;
other bank facing this situation would be out there trying to push loans. Our lending&#13;
volume is going way down. How are we going to make money in the future?â&#128;&#150; And by the&#13;
way, weâ&#128;&#152;ve learned over the sixty-year history of the Bank that when the Bank makes&#13;
loans, it makes money off of them in the long run. And so that's when we started putting&#13;
a lot of these presentations together that Iâ&#128;&#152;ve shared with you: How does the Bank make&#13;
money? It does so out of being leveraged because of the way the Bank was created was&#13;
as a leveraged financial institution. And over time, by using its leverage, it was able to&#13;
generate income that was available to fund the evolving development priorities of the&#13;
day, which is where the finance and the development come back together again.&#13;
&#13;
But this sort of blurring of IBRD and IDA and some of the oddball proposals that were&#13;
coming from people like the [Allan H.] Meltzer Commission, where they would say,&#13;
â&#128;&#149;No, weâ&#128;&#152;ve got to push out the high-income borrowers at the Bank.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
And Iâ&#128;&#152;d say to them, I said to Professor Meltzer himself, you know, I said, â&#128;&#149;Please&#13;
understand that the way the Bank is structured, if we lose all of our good borrowers we&#13;
are not going to be able to lend to the weak borrowers.â&#128;&#150; And I think, you know, there was&#13;
this notion of, â&#128;&#149;Well, okay, then maybe weâ&#128;&#152;ll start to see the unwinding of the Bank. We&#13;
will put that money more into sort of an endowment or a grant-making model because,&#13;
quite frankly, thatâ&#128;&#152;s where we think we need to go.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
And so many of the debates that started in the U.S. to me that were absolutely so devoid&#13;
of substance about should we be giving subsidized loans or grants--I mean, to this day&#13;
thereâ&#128;&#152;s still a big debate about this. I always used to say to people, I tried to speak in very&#13;
plain language to them, I said, â&#128;&#149;Look, have you tried to buy a car recently?â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
The answer was, â&#128;&#149;Yes,â&#128;&#150; okay?&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#149;Did the salesman offer you cash back or zero percent financing?â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
And the answer was, â&#128;&#149;Yes.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#149;Well, itâ&#128;&#152;s the same thing. We can give them a low rate financing, or we can give them&#13;
cash. There is an economic and financial equivalent between those two. And, quite&#13;
&#13;
                                     Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                           June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         57&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
frankly, theyâ&#128;&#152;re both the same, and whether or not we give a grant or a loan doesnâ&#128;&#152;t&#13;
matter. Weâ&#128;&#152;re going to be able to give fewer grants than we can give loans because of&#13;
leverage and so forth, but guess what? If we give a grant and therefore canâ&#128;&#152;t give them as&#13;
much money as we could have had we loaned it to them, theyâ&#128;&#152;re going to go out and&#13;
borrow the money from somebody else at market rates. And, in effect, theyâ&#128;&#152;re going to&#13;
put together the grant and the market-rate lending and say, â&#128;&#151;Oh, we just got a subsidized&#13;
rate.â&#128;&#152; Well, I can give you the subsidized rate for the same amount. I mean this is a very&#13;
dysfunctional conversation, folks.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, itâ&#128;&#152;s driven by ideology and politics.&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: It is. By politics, but itâ&#128;&#152;s not by financial realities and, unfortunately, not&#13;
necessarily by what makes most sense from a development standpoint. So to me where&#13;
the Bank is at now and where the Bank group is at nowâ&#128;&#148;and again, I still regret&#13;
personally that there is not a clear CFO of the Bank Group, sort of moving capital where&#13;
it needs to and dealing with all of those issues--but it seems to me that the Bank is now at&#13;
a point where it understands how it makes money. Many more peopleâ&#128;&#148;we unlocked the&#13;
secrets, which we needed to do in order to make sure we were being both responsible and&#13;
responsive during the crisis. And if the expectation that I have going forwardâ&#128;&#148;and you&#13;
can see in some of the speeches Iâ&#128;&#152;ve madeâ&#128;&#148;which is I think volatility is here to stay, it&#13;
seems to me the Bank needs to operate where its Board, including the new Board&#13;
members who are constantly coming on stream, they need to understand: How does the&#13;
Bank make money? How does the Bank take risk? What are the limits, what are the&#13;
trade-offs? Can I put money into an admin budget thatâ&#128;&#152;s going to create knowledge? Or&#13;
should I put it into the reserves thatâ&#128;&#152;s going to allow lending? Or should I give the money&#13;
away?&#13;
&#13;
And the answer is: I donâ&#128;&#152;t know. Iâ&#128;&#152;m just a finance guy. I can quantify your choices. The&#13;
way you make your ultimate choice, of course, unfortunately, is going to be politics and&#13;
everything else, but it should also be based on what you think the returns are going to be.&#13;
And, unfortunately, in the development business I canâ&#128;&#152;t tell you what those returns are&#13;
going to be. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s where you have to look at the development side of the Bank and say&#13;
to them, â&#128;&#149;Where am I going to get the biggest development bang for the buck? Am I&#13;
going to get it from knowledge? Am I going to get it from lending? Am I going to get it&#13;
from grant-making, whatever the case might be?â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
Again, as a finance person, I could sayâ&#128;&#148;although with a development heartâ&#128;&#148;I could say,&#13;
â&#128;&#149;Look, I can set up the framework, and I can try to hold you accountable for coming up&#13;
with the answers on the returns because if you tell me what the returns are, I can tell you&#13;
how to invest the money.â&#128;&#150; I think ultimately itâ&#128;&#152;s the Board thatâ&#128;&#152;s feeling that pressure of:&#13;
Are we using our resources in the most efficient and effective way? And the only way&#13;
you can do that is to have clarity on the availability of funds and clarity on the returns of&#13;
the funds, and I think that financial framework is now more or less visible to the Board,&#13;
probably less so to many of the shareholders if they havenâ&#128;&#152;t been following carefully&#13;
enough.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                           June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           58&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But I feel like I left the Bank in a position to understand the interplay between its&#13;
structure as a financial institution and its mission as a development institution, and&#13;
recognizing that you need the framework of one to help guide the decisions of the other.&#13;
And maybe at some point in timeâ&#128;&#148;and I donâ&#128;&#152;t know the answer to this one, as much as I&#13;
have talked to you and Iâ&#128;&#152;ve spoken publicly about the genius of the founders of the Bank&#13;
to have structured something that was so unfortunately complicated but out of that&#13;
complexity some flexibilityâ&#128;&#148;Iâ&#128;&#152;m not sure that it is infinitely flexible. There may come a&#13;
time?&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: This was one of my last questions: What do you see?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: And you know what? I think itâ&#128;&#152;s a decision that people will shy away from if&#13;
they can. Itâ&#128;&#152;s going to be a tough decision. Politics are going to get in the way. And it was&#13;
pretty clear to me that Jim Wolfensohn, in the waning years of his presidency, was not&#13;
going to be able to resolve this issue. I think itâ&#128;&#152;s got to be something that a new president&#13;
coming in would have to say, â&#128;&#149;Iâ&#128;&#152;m going to make this the hallmark of my presidency, is&#13;
that weâ&#128;&#152;re going to figure out where weâ&#128;&#152;re going as an institution.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
I think what Jim did certainly was to refocus the institution towards being development&#13;
focused and poverty-alleviation focused and corruption-reduction focused and all sorts of&#13;
things. And I think Jim personally created out of the Bank a bully pulpit to put&#13;
development onto the front page of the Financial Times, for which he deserves an awful&#13;
lot of credit, because, you know, thereâ&#128;&#152;s financial leverage and then thereâ&#128;&#152;s political&#13;
leverage and issue leverage. And I think Jim was a master of thatâ&#128;&#148;is a master of that.&#13;
&#13;
But I still think that the Board and/or a president are going to need to kind of look at their&#13;
situation and say, â&#128;&#149;Well, where does my money come from, and where does it go? And&#13;
am I having my greatest impact? And how do I govern these decisions?â&#128;&#150; And you get&#13;
into the governance issue with the Board and so forth and so on. And, by the way,&#13;
remember youâ&#128;&#152;re sitting onâ&#128;&#148;I donâ&#128;&#152;t know what the number is today; I know what it was&#13;
last year when I leftâ&#128;&#148;youâ&#128;&#152;re sitting on about thirty billion dollars of paid-in capital and&#13;
retained earnings, most of which is retained earnings. And within the entire Bank Group,&#13;
that is what gives management of the Bank its flexibility to operate with relatively little&#13;
oversight, because itâ&#128;&#152;s sitting on a $30 billion capital base that generates a certain amount&#13;
of income that allows the management to kind of set up a budget and a spending pattern&#13;
and a lending pattern that makes a whole lot of sense. But if someone said today, you&#13;
know, â&#128;&#149;Look at the development challenges the world is facing. I just found $30 billion&#13;
that I can put against it,â&#128;&#150; now, you canâ&#128;&#152;t do it overnight because you have to unwind the&#13;
lending book at the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
So my challenge to that new president or to that Board, whenever they come in, is:&#13;
â&#128;&#149;Look, if you think that you can meet the development mission of the Bank as a lending&#13;
institution, youâ&#128;&#152;ve got it. Itâ&#128;&#152;s here. Now you need to work out some of the IBRD-IDA&#13;
and some of the IBRD-IFC issues. But by and large, youâ&#128;&#152;re here. But if you decide that&#13;
over the long haul that being a lending institution for development is no longer the way&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                           June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            59&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
youâ&#128;&#152;re going to have your impact, there may be a limit as to how malleable your financial&#13;
structure really is.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
I donâ&#128;&#152;t have a view exactly about what the right answer is. I think people are going to&#13;
have to face the question. We did have some analyses. Iâ&#128;&#152;m not sure I gave them to you&#13;
because Iâ&#128;&#152;m not sure I found them. But we did some sort ofâ&#128;&#148;no, I did give them to you.&#13;
We found someâ&#128;&#148;we did some thirty-year scenarios about, â&#128;&#149;Gosh, if we stop lending&#13;
tomorrow, weâ&#128;&#152;re going to eat into our capital over time.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
 So I feel strongly that the Bank Group--emphasis on â&#128;&#149;Groupâ&#128;&#150;--needs to assess its&#13;
mission and its business model, its modus operandi, its governance, and say, â&#128;&#149;Are we&#13;
aligned from financial institution to development institution the way that Bank was&#13;
aligned in 1944?â&#128;&#150; Because, boy, oh boy, it was aligned then. But they had the luxury of&#13;
creating the Bank at a time when they knew what their development model was, which&#13;
was big infrastructure lending needing lots of foreign exchange at a time the capital&#13;
markets were discontinuous. And, boy, this Bank kept changing over and over and over.&#13;
But it never needed to change its finances or its structure or its governance. I donâ&#128;&#152;t know&#13;
whether it is positioned well for the future. I think thatâ&#128;&#152;s for future presidents and future&#13;
Boards to decide.&#13;
&#13;
And frankly, you know, I look back and say one of the legacies I am proudest of is I gave&#13;
them the tools with which to have that understanding and that dialogue, recognizing that&#13;
ultimately itâ&#128;&#152;s going to be a negotiated decision in a political context. But theyâ&#128;&#152;re going&#13;
to go so not with their heads in the sand.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Why did you decide to leave in July 2003?&#13;
&#13;
PERLIN: I left in July 2003. It was largely a personal decision. A couple of reasons. I&#13;
guess I had a bit of the ten-year itch. It was ten years since I had arrived. Also, in terms of&#13;
my own personal standing, my children were growing, and oddly enough I always felt&#13;
that as challenging as the job of the Bank was, I was always able to marry it with what I&#13;
considered to be a pretty good family life, particularly when I was in the finance side of&#13;
the Bank. And with my kids going off to college, I no longer felt that I needed to keep the&#13;
same sort of balance.&#13;
&#13;
CapitalOne, as a company, came to me, as they had nine years earlier when they went&#13;
public, and offered me the same job, that of CFO, at a time where I felt I was probably&#13;
within two years of retirement from the Bank anyway. My feeling was that I needed to&#13;
leave at least a year before Jim so somebody else had a chance to kind of come up to&#13;
speed or I needed to stay at least a year after Jim left in order to help induct his successor,&#13;
not quite knowing where that successor might come from and what their position might&#13;
be. But my feeling was that I was going to leave either a year before Jim or a year after&#13;
Jim. And when CapitalOne came to me and made me a very compelling financial offer,&#13;
along with an opportunity to help shape this company because itâ&#128;&#152;s in a very important&#13;
crossroads. It just became a Fortune 200 company. Itâ&#128;&#152;s buying a bank. Itâ&#128;&#152;s going into a&#13;
whole new realm. Itâ&#128;&#152;s geography was very important to me. As I think I mentioned off&#13;
&#13;
                                     Gary L. Perlin&#13;
                           June 24 and 25, 2004â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        60&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
line to you yesterday, itâ&#128;&#152;s a Virginia-based company, both Richmond and McLean, which&#13;
happens to align with my two homes in Fairfax County and in Williamsburg. And so it&#13;
was not a decision to leave the Bank, contrasting it with my previous major career&#13;
decision, which was to leave Fannie Mae not because I knew where I was going but&#13;
because it was time to leave. In this case it was a decision to join CapitalOne, which&#13;
triggered my decision to depart from the Bank. But I can say, I think in good conscience,&#13;
that CapitalOne came to me in 1998 and offered me this job as well, but it was in the&#13;
midst of the Asia crisis, and I said, â&#128;&#149; Iâ&#128;&#152;m sorry. I canâ&#128;&#152;t leave right now.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
I felt that the condition of the Bank in the spring of 2003 was such that there was enough&#13;
kind of blue sky. We were making it through the Argentina crisis. I felt that we had made&#13;
significant progress in laying out to the Board and to our shareholders and senior&#13;
management what choices the Bank needed to make. I felt that I could leave the Bank in&#13;
good hands. I had no qualms about leaving the Bank at that moment.&#13;
&#13;
I did feel that the next important thing I could have done at the Bank would have been&#13;
perhaps to derive a more long-term decision about how the Bank was going to reconcile&#13;
its financial institutional goals with its development goals. Unfortunately, I sensed that&#13;
(a) it would always be a political decision, but more importantly I felt the Bank was&#13;
probably not going to face it until at least a year beyond the end of Jim Wolfensohnâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
term, either a new president coming in or, potentially, if Jim were to stay, maybe a desire&#13;
on his part to leave an additional legacy.&#13;
&#13;
So I felt I had contributed about as much as I was going to be able to contribute, that&#13;
there was probably going to be a period of a couple of years before real next steps were&#13;
going to be taken. And so again, the question was called by the offer I received from&#13;
CapitalOne, but when I balanced it, it came out with a much more opportune time for me&#13;
to take an early retirement from the Bank before it was too late to start a new career&#13;
outside. So it was absolutely a demand-pull, but at a time that I felt was a responsible&#13;
time to leave the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, thank you very much.&#13;
