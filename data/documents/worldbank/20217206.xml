Global Scaling Up Handwashing is a project by the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) focused on applying innovative&#13;
behavior change approaches to improve handwashing with soap behavior among women of reproductive age (ages 15â&#128;&#147;49)&#13;
and primary school-age children (ages 5â&#128;&#147;9). It was implemented by local and national governments with technical support&#13;
from WSP in four countries: Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam. For more information, please visit www.wsp.org/&#13;

&amp;#12;II.           Methods&#13;
&#13;
In each country, representative samples of households with children under 2 years       Handwashing was measured&#13;
old were identified in preselected geographic clusters for inclusion in the impact&#13;
evaluation. The baseline survey of the impact evaluation was conducted in Peru          at the household and&#13;
(2008), Senegal (2009), and Vietnam (2009) (Chase and Do 2010; Galiani and&#13;
Orsola-Vidal 2010; Orsola-Vidal and Yusuf 2011). Information regarding the&#13;
                                                                                        individual levels using several&#13;
data collection methods for the baseline surveys can be found in the country-           methods of data collection:&#13;

vant to the measurement of handwashing behavior and analysis of the baseline sur-       rapid observations, self-&#13;
vey data. Country-specific analyses are reported here, without aggregation of data&#13;
beyond the country level. These data were analyzed for the entire set of households     report, and structured&#13;
and individuals measured at baseline, irrespective of treatment arm. Equivalence&#13;
                                                                                        observations.&#13;
of the treatment arms has been established in the country-specific reports.&#13;
&#13;
Handwashing was measured at the household and individual levels using the&#13;
methods of data collection described above: rapid observations, self-reports, and&#13;
structured observations (Ram 2013). Key indicators of handwashing behavior are&#13;
described by the level and method of data collection in Table 1. In all three coun-&#13;
tries, both rapid observations and self-reports were obtained among all house-&#13;
holds included in the overall baseline surveys.&#13;
&#13;
Structured observations were carried out in a subset of households included in&#13;
the baseline survey in Peru and Senegal. Structured observations were not carried&#13;
out in the Vietnam baseline survey. Observations for individual-level data col-&#13;
lection were carried out among primary caregivers of children. In Peru, observa-&#13;
tions began between 6:30 and 9:30 a.m., and lasted 4 to 5 hours. Self-report and&#13;
structured observation data are used to describe individual handwashing behavior&#13;
at critical times. The following critical times for handwashing behavior were of&#13;
interest in these analyses: after fecal contact, before food preparation, before eat-&#13;
ing and before feeding a child.&#13;

2.1 Data Analysis&#13;
This section describes the various measures of handwashing collected using rapid&#13;
observations, self-reports, and structured observations.&#13;
&#13;
Presence of soap anywhere in the home&#13;
The indicator is defined as the presence of at least one type of soap observed by&#13;
the enumerator anywhere in the home.&#13;
&#13;
Following observations of handwashing places, enumerators asked the household&#13;
respondent to show soap typically used for washing hands, irrespective of where&#13;
it was located in the home. All households that allowed observation of soap any-&#13;
where in the home are included in this analysis.&#13;

    with soap and all other times that hands were washed with                      in numerous ways. Here, handwashing behavior is ana-&#13;
    soap during the previous day. Although information about                       lyzed at the household level, rather than based on the role&#13;
    a number of times for handwashing was captured, those                          of observed individuals within the household (e.g., pri-&#13;

3.1 Handwashing Behavior Measured at the Household Level                             Only a minority of&#13;
Presence of soap anywhere in the home&#13;
Observation of soap anywhere in the home was possible in 3,658 Peru house-           households in each country&#13;
holds, 1,373 Senegal households, and 3,129 Vietnam households (Table 2). At&#13;
least one type of soap for washing hands was observed in the majority of house-&#13;
                                                                                     had soap and water together&#13;
holds in all three countries, but was nearly universal in Vietnam (97 percent). In   at two handwashing places.&#13;
contrast, 82 percent of Peru households and 59 percent of Senegal households&#13;
had at least one type of soap for washing hands somewhere in the home. The&#13;
most common type of soap observed was powder soap in Vietnam (83 percent)&#13;
and Peru (60 percent), and multipurpose bar soap in Senegal (47 percent).&#13;
&#13;
Number of handwashing places, and presence of soap and water in&#13;
those places&#13;
The number of handwashing places present in each household was tallied based&#13;
on the inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined above and in Table 2. Because re-&#13;
spondents were asked about handwashing places specifically used after defecation&#13;
and before food preparation, the maximum number of handwashing places pos-&#13;
sible was two. In Peru, among 3,448 households, 8 percent had no handwashing&#13;
place, 61 percent had only one place, and 31 percent had two places. In Senegal,&#13;
among 1,513 households, 45 percent had no handwashing place, 32 percent had&#13;
only one place, and 23 percent had two places. In Vietnam, among 3,143 house-&#13;
holds, 11 percent had no handwashing place, 58 percent had only one place, and&#13;
31 percent had two places.&#13;
&#13;
The availability of soap and water at one or more handwashing places in 3,448&#13;
households in Peru, 1,513 households in Senegal, and 3,143 households in Viet-&#13;
nam was examined. Soap was present at only one handwashing place in 55 per-&#13;
cent of Vietnam households and 51 percent of Peru households, in contrast to&#13;
23 percent of Senegal households. Soap was present in two handwashing places&#13;
in a minority of households in all three countries: Peru (18 percent), Senegal&#13;
(15 percent), and Vietnam (29 percent). Whereas soap was not present at any&#13;
handwashing place in 63 percent of Senegal households, this was true of only&#13;
17 percent of Vietnam households and 32 percent of Peru households. Water&#13;
was present at one handwashing place in 58 percent of Peru households, 28 per-&#13;
cent of Senegal households, and 57 percent of Vietnam households. Water was&#13;
present at two handwashing places in 23 percent of Peru households, 15 per-&#13;
cent of Senegal households, and 30 percent of Vietnam households. Soap and&#13;
water together were present at one handwashing place in the majority of Vietnam&#13;
(53 percent) and Peru (46 percent) households, in contrast to 21 percent of Sen-&#13;
egal households. Only a minority of households in each country had soap and&#13;
water together at two handwashing places. Soap and water together were present&#13;
in two handwashing places in 15 percent of Peru households, 13 percent of Sen-&#13;
egal households, and 27 percent of Vietnam households.&#13;

caregivers in Peru and Vietnam reported having washed hands with soap before                              The vast majority of&#13;
feeding a child during the previous day in contrast to only 5 percent of Senegal&#13;
caregivers. Similar proportions of caregivers in Senegal (16 percent) and Vietnam                         caregivers in all three&#13;
(20 percent) reported washing hands with soap before eating; this data was not&#13;
available for Peru due to an error in the data collection tool. Whereas 91 percent&#13;
                                                                                                          countries reported washing&#13;
of Peru caregivers and 81 percent of Vietnam caregivers reported washing hands                            hands with soap at least once&#13;
with soap at one or more of these critical times, only 46 percent of Senegal care-&#13;
givers reported doing so. Few caregivers in each country indicated washing hands                          during the previous day.&#13;
with soap at each of these critical times, but it is possible that the critical time did&#13;
not occur (for example, they may not have had to feed a child themselves).&#13;
&#13;
The proportion of respondents indicating that washing with soap is the best way&#13;
to clean hands was nearly identical in the three countries: Peru (85 percent), Sen-&#13;
egal (88 percent), and Vietnam (86 percent).&#13;
&#13;
Enumerators rated the cleanliness of caregiversâ&#128;&#153; nails, palms, and fingerpads. Rat-&#13;
ings among caregivers in Senegal and Vietnam were similar to each other but&#13;
dissimilar to ratings among Peru caregivers. In Peru, enumerators indicated the&#13;
presence of visible dirt under nails (26 percent), on palms (19 percent), and on&#13;
fingerpads (19 percent). Visible dirt was much less commonly recorded in Sen-&#13;
egal: nails (10 percent), palms (4 percent), and fingerpads (4 percent). Similar to&#13;
Senegal, in Vietnam, visible dirt was recorded for 5 percent of nails, 2 percent&#13;
of palms, and 2 percent of fingerpads. Hand cleanliness was categorized on a&#13;
three-point scale based on the observations of nails, palms, and fingerpads. If all&#13;
three aspects of the hand were recorded as â&#128;&#156;clean,â&#128;&#157; overall hand cleanliness was&#13;
rated â&#128;&#156;clean.â&#128;&#157; If at least one aspect of the hands was recorded as having â&#128;&#156;visible&#13;
dirt,â&#128;&#157; overall hand cleanliness was rated as â&#128;&#156;very unclean.â&#128;&#157; All others were rated&#13;
as â&#128;&#156;somewhat unclean.â&#128;&#157; Hands were rated as â&#128;&#156;cleanâ&#128;&#157; in 42 percent of Peru care-&#13;
givers, 71 percent of Senegal caregivers, and 63 percent of Vietnam caregivers.&#13;
Hands were rated as â&#128;&#156;very uncleanâ&#128;&#157; in 24 percent of Peru caregivers, 7 percent of&#13;
Senegal caregivers, and 4 percent of Vietnam caregivers. It should be noted that&#13;
ratings of cleanliness on one aspect of the hand were significantly correlated with&#13;
ratings of cleanliness on another aspect of the hand. For example, in Senegal,&#13;
palm cleanliness ratings were highly correlated with fingerpad cleanliness (R =&#13;
0.92, p &lt; 0.0001); palm cleanliness ratings were also significantly correlated with&#13;
fingernail cleanliness ratings, although the strength of the correlation was some-&#13;
what lower (R = 0.67, p &lt; 0.0001). Similar findings were noted for both Peru and&#13;
Vietnam (data not shown).&#13;

&amp;#12;IV.               Discussion&#13;
&#13;
The baseline surveys for Global Scaling Up Handwashing in Peru, Senegal, and&#13;
Vietnam indicate a substantial potential and need to improve handwashing be-&#13;
havior in all three Scaling Up countries. Based on the authorsâ&#128;&#153; experience and&#13;
that of others engaged in measuring handwashing (Ram 2013; Biran et al. 2008;&#13;
Ram et al. 2010) several measures of handwashing behavior were employed to de-&#13;
scribe related but distinct constructs. These constructs describing the Focus, Op-&#13;
portunity, and Ability domains of the FOAM framework (Coombes and Devine&#13;
2010) include the availability of materials required for handwashing, behavior at&#13;
critical times for handwashing, and cleanliness of hands. The various measures&#13;
paint relatively consistent pictures of the state of handwashing within each proj-&#13;
ect country, with the greatest opportunity to improve handwashing behavior in&#13;
Senegal, but also robust potential to do so in both Peru and Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
In Senegal, only a minority of households were found to have a fixed handwash-&#13;
ing place near toileting and food preparation areas, and soap was available any-&#13;
where in the home in only about 60 percent of households. Moreover, small&#13;
minorities of Senegal households observed were found to have washed hands with&#13;
soap at least once after fecal contact and before food preparation. Even in Peru,&#13;
fewer than half of households under structured observation were found to wash&#13;
hands with soap after fecal contact, and far fewer did so before food preparation.&#13;
Washing hands with soap, or even with water alone, at these two critical times&#13;
(after defecation and before food preparation) has been associated with reduced&#13;
diarrhea risk (Luby et al. 2010). These findings indicate the substantial need to&#13;
improve handwashing at critical times in both Senegal and Peru.&#13;
&#13;
There may be several explanations for the low frequency of handwashing with&#13;
soap at critical times in the Scaling Up countries. It was common in Senegal not&#13;
to have a specific place to wash hands, even after defecation. In both Peru and&#13;
Vietnam, the handwashing place was more than 10 feet away from the toilet facil-&#13;
ity in a third of households. The presence of a fixed handwashing place, particu-&#13;
larly inside or in close proximity to the toilet facility, may provide a useful visual&#13;
cue to stimulate handwashing behavior. In particular, such visual cues may be&#13;
critical to the development of handwashing habits, described by Curtis as â&#128;&#156;auto-&#13;
mated behaviors produced by cues, often as part of a routineâ&#128;&#157; (Curtis et al. 2009).&#13;
In high-income countries, hand hygiene in healthcare settings was believed to be&#13;
hampered because clinicians were forced to walk away from patient care areas in&#13;
order to access sinks for handwashing with soap. The placement of waterless hand&#13;
sanitizer dispensers in large-volume in-patient care areas has led to improvements&#13;
in hand hygiene behavior by providing the visual cue and by improving access to&#13;
the necessary materials (Luby and Halder 2008; CDC 2002).&#13;

                                                         must be present in order to allow the behavior to occur. The presence of water at&#13;

     particularly inside or in                           der 2008). A number of observational studies demonstrate lower risk of diar-&#13;
     close proximity to the toilet                       rhea among households with soap observed anywhere in the home, compared&#13;
                                                         to households without soap (DuBois et al. 2006; Peterson et al. 1998). An in-&#13;

                                                         Peru and Senegal were found to have soap and water at that place. Water was&#13;
                                                         more commonly present at either fixed handwashing location than was soap. It&#13;
                                                         is notable that large proportions of households that designated places for wash-&#13;

                                                         at those locations. This suggests that the practice of designating a handwashing&#13;
                                                         location may contribute to building a handwashing habit at these critical times.&#13;

                                                         than before food preparation. Recent work from Bangladesh suggests that hand-&#13;

                                                         Self-reported handwashing behavior has been found repeatedly to overestimate&#13;
                                                         observed handwashing behavior (Biran et al. 2008; Manunâ&#128;&#153;Ebo et al. 1997;&#13;

                                                         of Peru caregivers reporting having washed hands at least once following fecal&#13;

                                                         with respect to food preparation. Even behavior during structured observation is&#13;
                                                         probably subject to reactivity based on the presence of the observer (Ram et al.&#13;
                                                         2010). Self-report and behavior displayed during observation are likely subject&#13;

            Analysis of hand washing behaviors measured
            in baseline impact evaluation surveys : findings from Peru,
            Senegal, and Vietnam
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Hand washing with soap has been shown to
            reduce diarrhea and respiratory disease, the two leading
            causes of childhood deaths in low- and middle-income
            settings. Global scaling up hand washing was initiated in
            2006 by the water and sanitation program (WSP) in Peru,
            Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam. The hand washing promotion
            interventions deployed in the global scaling up countries
            were developed using a framework known as focus,
            opportunity, ability, and motivation (FOAM). A hand washing
            promotion intervention can only result in improved health or
            other downstream benefits if it results in increased hand
            washing behavior. In the impact evaluation of global scaling
            up hand washing, hand washing is measured using
            self-reports, rapid observations, and structured
            observations, recognizing that each method provides useful
            insights into awareness about hand washing, the availability
            of materials necessary for hand washing, and the practice of
            washing hands at critical times. Specifically, with respect
            to the FOAM framework, this report addresses constructs
            within the focus, opportunity, and ability domains. The goal
            of this report is to describe hand washing behavior of
            households included in the project impact evaluation, as
            measured during the baseline surveys conducted in Peru,
            Senegal, and Vietnam. The baseline surveys of global scaling
            up hand washing indicate opportunities to improve hand
            washing behavior in all of the countries where interventions
            are being tested. In the future, correlations can be
            described between measures and relationship with disease
            risk and other hygiene behaviors in the home, including
            sanitation and household water treatment.
