1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1           An integral part of a well-functioning market economy is an acceptable medium  of&#13;
exchange for economic transactions. As economic activity increases in sophistication, so too does the&#13;
need for an efficient and secure system of discharging financial obligations. Cash is a convenient form of&#13;
payment for most small transactions where buyer and seller meet face to face. But most large&#13;
transactions require some form of non-cash payment instrument such as a paper check or an electronic&#13;
payment order to move funds. These non-cash payments also require the use of a financial intermediary,&#13;
usually the banking system, to transfer funds from the payer to the payee. A payment system refers&#13;
collectively to the institutions, instruments and procedures used for exchanging financial value between&#13;
two parties. Weaknesses in a payment system can result in the inefficient use of the available money&#13;
stock, inequitable risk sharing between trading parties, lack of confidence in the banking system, and&#13;
inadequate support for the development of other financial services. l&#13;
1.2            Different payment instruments, each with a unique set of standards and processing&#13;
requirements, are required to serve user needs. Paper-based instruments such as checks are used for a&#13;
wide variety of transactions that are typically low-value and less time-critical. Electronic payments are&#13;
instructions passed between banks without a corresponding exchange of paper. Such instruments are&#13;
generally used for high-value payments requiring immediate transfer of funds. Card-based payments&#13;
relying on automated teller machines (ATMs), and credit and debit cards are generally used for consumer&#13;
payments at the point of sale. Payment services are required to process: local inter-bank debit and credit&#13;
payments; non-local, inter- and intra-bank debit and credit payments; high-value and other time-sensitive&#13;
credit payments; and international payments in a variety of currencies.2&#13;
1.3           All payments require settlement, which refers to the transfer of value between banks in&#13;
respect of payment obligations. Settlement can be immediate (funds are immediately and irrevocably&#13;
available for use) or provisional (funds are available on a provisional basis pending confirmation at some&#13;
later time). The settlement mechanism is either net (payments are settled after netting debits against&#13;
credits on an aggregate basis processed periodically in batches) or gross (payments are processed on a&#13;
transaction-by-transaction basis). Settlement finality is guaranteed by the system operator and system&#13;
participants according to pre-defined rules.&#13;
A full discussion of payment systems is contained in "Modemizing Payment Systems in Emerging&#13;
Economies," Policy Research Working Paper 1336 (World Bank, 1994). A summary discussion is contained in&#13;
"Project Design for Payment Systems," FPD Note No. 37 (World Bank, 1995).&#13;
2   A credit payment is the transfer of funds from payer to payee resulting from a payment instruction initiated by&#13;
the payer. A debit payment is the transfer of funds from payer to payee resulting from a payment collection&#13;
instruction from the payee's bank to the payer's bank. Cashing a check is an example of a debit payment. A&#13;
wire transfer is an example of a credit payment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
Well-functioning payment systems depend on several critical factors:&#13;
* Speed: Most payments do not need to be transferred instantaneously, and indeed, even&#13;
in industrial countries, only large, time-critical payments are made in real time. This&#13;
notwithstanding, users of payment services must be confident that payments will be&#13;
effected within a prescribed time. Delays in payments result, inter alia, in loss of value,&#13;
particularly in highly inflationary economies, and create float, thereby decreasing the&#13;
efficiency of funds circulation in the economy.&#13;
*  Certainty: The point at which funds are irrevocably available for use, or settlement&#13;
finality, is a critical requirement in any payment system. Uncertainties about the&#13;
completion of the transaction hamper the exchange of goods and services in an&#13;
economy.&#13;
* Reliability: A payment system must be reliable if it is to maintain user confidence.&#13;
Failures in the payment system can have severe, long-lasting impacts on users'&#13;
perceptions, and systems must have adequate contingency provisions and backup&#13;
capabilities.&#13;
- Security: A payment system must have adequate arrangements to deal with fraud,&#13;
credit risk, protection against unauthorized use, and dispute resolution.&#13;
* Convenience: Even the best designed system is doomed to failure if it does not provide&#13;
convenience to users.&#13;
.  Cost:  Similarly, cost is an important consideration, and should be suited to the&#13;
particular transaction instrument.&#13;
1.4           Payment solutions must be tailored to the unique requirements of a given economy, and&#13;
will typically involve a series of tradeoffs among the above factors. Ultimately, all these factors have to&#13;
do with promoting user confidence in the system in order to meet the needs of a growing economy.&#13;
1.5           This report presents the appraisal of the proposed Payment System  and Bank&#13;
Modemization Project for Viet Nam. The project was prepared by the National Payments Council with&#13;
help from external consultants hired under a PHRD Grant for project preparation. Chapter II of this&#13;
report contains a summary discussion of the financial sector, including the current status of the country's&#13;
payment system and the Government's sector development strategy. It also situates the proposed project&#13;
in the larger context of IDA involvement in the financial sector in Viet Nam. Chapter III contains a&#13;
description of the project and implementation arrangements, while Chapter IV discusses project&#13;
beneficiaries. Financial aspects, benefits and risks of the project are discussed in Chapter V, and a&#13;
summary of agreements to be reached is presented in Chapter VI. Annexes to this report present profiles&#13;
of the beneficiary institutions, as well as summary discussions of key implementation topics. A Project&#13;
Management Plan, prepared by the National Payments Council, is dedicated to a fuller description of&#13;
implementation plans and project management issues and is available in project files.&#13;

2. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR AND PAYMENT SYSTEM&#13;
DEVELOPMENT&#13;
2.1          The financial sector in Viet Nam consists essentially of the banking sector. The State&#13;
Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) was the country's monobank until 1988, when a separation of commercial and&#13;
central banking activities took place. Legislative reforms introduced in 1990 extended banking services&#13;
to include a wide variety of ownership structures, and there are in operation today 4 state-owned&#13;
commercial banks (SOCBs); 36 share holding banks (30 in urban areas); 69 credit cooperatives; 3 joint&#13;
venture banks; 16 foreign bank branches (and 64 foreign bank representative offices); and 153 popular&#13;
credit funds. There are also two finance companies and one government-owned insurance company. The&#13;
Government is developing a securities market, and a limited debt securities market is expected to be&#13;
operational by end-1995. A full account of recent developments in the financial sector is contained in&#13;
Viet Nam Financial Sector Review. An Agenda for Financial Sector Development (World Bank Report&#13;
No. 13135-VN), March 1995.&#13;
A. SECTOR OVERVIEW&#13;
2.2          Despite the impressive numbers of new banking institutions entering the market, Viet&#13;
Nam remains an under banked country. The ratio of currency and deposit liabilities of banks (M3, or&#13;
broad money) to GDP appears to have stabilized in recent years at around 23%, a level considerably&#13;
lower than that in other transitional economies and regional countries. Anecdotal evidence and data from&#13;
the Viet Nam Living Standards Survey suggest that considerable savings in the form of foreign currency,&#13;
gold and precious metals and stones remain outside the banking system. Increased public confidence in&#13;
the Government's macroeconomic stabilization policies and in the financial system is necessary to bring&#13;
these savings into the formal system. The share of narrow money (currency plus demand deposits, or&#13;
Ml) to broad money (M3) has grown from 46% in 1989 to 56% in 1994. Currency continues to make up&#13;
about 80% of MI, and thus the share of cash in broad money was around 45% in 1994. This compares&#13;
with a cash/broad money ratio of 10% in ASEAN countries and less than 25% in most transitional&#13;
economies. The large proportion of cash in the broad money ratio reflects a lack of confidence in the&#13;
banking system caused, inter alia, by deficiencies in the payment system and a lack of banking services&#13;
geared to the individual.&#13;
The State Bank of Viet Nam&#13;
2.3          SBV's role is slowly but steadily evolving as it modernizes its operations in the context&#13;
of a developing market economy. It ceased direct lending to the productive sectors in 1991 and&#13;
terminated direct financing of the state budget in 1992. It is gradually adopting credit and money control&#13;
policies along the lines of central banks in market economies. Other central banking functions that the&#13;
SBV currently undertakes include active management of the country's foreign exchange reserves and the&#13;
conduct of inter-bank markets for domestic funds and foreign exchange. However, SBV still operates&#13;
under government guidance, and steps should be taken to increase its independence.&#13;
2.4          SBV has its head office in Hanoi, and branches in each of the country's 53 provinces.&#13;
This large branch network loses its relevance in a two-tier banking system. These branches are involved&#13;
in a variety of central bank activities such as supervision and clearing and settlement of payment&#13;
transactions. There is a need to modify the SBV's organizational structure and to redefine the role of its&#13;
provincial branches.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
2.5           Monetary Control. A key challenge for Viet Nam is to strike a proper balance between&#13;
its desire for rapid growth and the need for macroeconomic stability. The Government has taken far-&#13;
reaching steps to unshackle the economy from central control, and has faced severe macroeconomic&#13;
imbalances in the transition process. Given the reemergence of inflationary pressures in 1994, the&#13;
Government is focusing on further reducing the fiscal and external deficits under an economic program&#13;
supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. For the foreseeable future,&#13;
Viet Nam's monetary stance will have to be contractionary.&#13;
2.6           The SBV exercises monetary control through three instruments of monetary policy:&#13;
setting interest rates on banking system assets and liabilities; varying the cost and availability of central&#13;
bank credit to banks; and stipulating reserve ratios on their deposits. SBV has recently introduced credit&#13;
ceilings, in the aggregate and bank-by-bank, in an attempt to contain credit expansion. These instruments&#13;
are largely direct in character and their use retains elements of interventionism. The SBV is gradually&#13;
developing the tools and the skills to exercise indirect monetary control. An auction system to issue&#13;
Treasury bills is being developed, and pilot auctions commenced in December, 1994.&#13;
2.7           Supervision and Prudential Regulations. Bank supervision has existed since SBV's&#13;
creation in 1951, but needs to be modernized to better serve the needs of a rapidly growing banking&#13;
sector with diversified ownership. At present, SBV maintains an off-site surveillance system, developed&#13;
with technical assistance from the IMF, which is based on monthly prudential returns submitted by&#13;
banks. While improvements are required, the systematic collection and analysis of data are good first&#13;
steps in ensuring supervisory oversight of the deposit money banks. On-site supervision is largely&#13;
bottom-up at the branch or sub-branch level, and is conducted by the SBV's provincial branch network.&#13;
A change in the focus of supervision to a more top-down approach is required to ensure the health and&#13;
stability of the banking system as a whole. This implies a redirection of resources to address the sources&#13;
of greatest systemic risk.&#13;
The Commercial Banks&#13;
2.8           The commercial banking sector is dominated by the four state-owned commercial banks&#13;
(SOCBs), which accounted for 87% of commercial bank operations in Viet Nam in 1994. There has been&#13;
substantial growth of credit to the private sector since 1990, and although state-owned enterprises&#13;
(SOEs) are still the dominant users of credit, their share of bank credit has dropped to around 60% in&#13;
1994, from an average of 86% in 1991-92. Credit to the private sector consists essentially of short-term&#13;
loans for agriculture and commerce. Long-term lending, provided mainly by SOCBs to SOEs, is largely&#13;
in foreign currency. The structure of commercial bank funding has changed in recent times. In 1994,&#13;
around 40% of credit flows were met through a run-down of net foreign assets, reflecting in part an&#13;
increase in SOCB medium-term borrowing from foreign banks. The remainder was roughly equally&#13;
distributed among resources mobilized by the banking system on its own, net borrowings from the SBV,&#13;
and float associated with the weak payment system in Viet Nam.&#13;
2.9           An accurate assessment of bank financial performance is problematic, since accounting&#13;
practices deviate in many ways from international norms. A Chart of Accounts for commercial banks has&#13;
been defined with IMF assistance and is being implemented in all Vietnamese banks. However,&#13;
considerable upgrading is still required at the bank level to improve accounting practices. The&#13;
Government is canying out detailed portfolio audits and diagnostic reviews for two SOCBs, which will&#13;
permit a better assessment of their true financial situation. Similar diagnostics will also be undertaken for&#13;
the remaining four banks participating in the project. Chapter IV discusses the institutional framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
and financial performance of the six banks participating in the project, and detailed profiles of these&#13;
banks are given in Annex 10 to this report. Significant institution building is required to strengthen the&#13;
Vietnamese banking sector, and is being pursued through a variety of mechanisms, including the&#13;
proposed project (Section B).&#13;
B. THE GOVERNMENT'S FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY&#13;
2.10          The development of the financial sector in Viet Nam is necessarily going to be a long-&#13;
term process. Action is required on many fronts to create a modern financial system capable of&#13;
supporting the country's transition from a centrally-planned economy to a market-oriented one. A&#13;
comprehensive discussion of the Government's policy orientations in the financial sector is contained in&#13;
Viet Nam Financial Sector Review (Report 13135-VN). Key elements of the Government's development&#13;
strategy are outlined below.&#13;
2.11          The Government is pursuing three key objectives for the further development of the&#13;
sector in addition to maintaining a credible, sustained and stable macroeconomic environment. These&#13;
are: (a) moving toward a market-based policy in monetary management; (b) fostering efficiency and&#13;
competition in the sector through equal treatment for all participants and through modernization of&#13;
common systems; and (c) promoting public confidence in the banking system. Given the vast reform&#13;
needs and the institutional capacity constraints, the Government's strategy for achieving these objectives&#13;
is based on a building block approach in which areas of immediate concern are addressed as a priority.&#13;
This strategy is also dictated by the Government's pragmatic political stance of gradual, but sustained&#13;
reform based on achieving a broad consensus among stakeholders.&#13;
2.12          In the area of monetary management, the Government intends to build upon its&#13;
achievements to date in moving from direct to indirect control. An auction system to issue Treasury bills&#13;
has been established, which provides a basic building block in the development of open market&#13;
operations. In the interim, steps are being taken to rationalize the direct instruments of monetary control&#13;
that are presently utilized. Interest rates are positive in real terms, and the inverted rate structure (the&#13;
stipulated rates for medium- and long-term loans are lower than those for short-term loans) is being&#13;
gradually redressed. Interest rate policy needs to be further modified to strengthen the financial&#13;
liberalization process, and this is an important element of the on-going policy dialogue that both the IMF&#13;
and the Bank are conducting with the Government. SBV's refinancing policy is being gradually modified&#13;
to make the SBV truly a lender of last resort. As part of the IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment&#13;
Facility (ESAF) program, the Government has removed the subsidy element involved in the refinancing&#13;
of specific, long-term loan contracts, and has limited the amount of such refinancing. The need for short-&#13;
term refinancing to cover shortfalls in settlement balances will be greatly diminished with the&#13;
consolidation of settlement accounts proposed under the proposed project (Chapter 3). The Government&#13;
prescribes a reserve requirement of 10% of deposits for all banks; however, effective reserves are&#13;
considerably higher since banks hold high levels of non-statutory "liquidity" or "transactions" balances&#13;
with the SBV. These pose a significant burden on the banking system, since reserves are not remunerated&#13;
on market terms. Here, too, improvements in the clearing and settlement function will eliminate the need&#13;
for large holdings of these other, non-statutory reserves.&#13;
2.13          A first step in rationalizing the role of the SBV branch network is being undertaken&#13;
through the removal of settlement accounts from the provincial level and their consolidation at the head&#13;
office level. The significance of this move should not be discounted. It represents an important step in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
rethinking the role of the provincial branches, notably with respect to their supervisory role, and is the&#13;
peg on which to hang further organizational reform of the SBV.&#13;
2.14          Improvements in accounting practices are required at the SBV, and the IMF is a&#13;
significant source of technical assistance in this area. Reforms in SBV's refinancing policy, including&#13;
caps on the amount of central bank credit, should help strengthen the financial position of the SBV.&#13;
2.15          Constraints to intermediation are being gradually removed. A key constraint is the&#13;
inadequate payment system (Section C), which is being addressed by the proposed project. The&#13;
Government intends to eliminate the turnover tax on banking activity (the tax ranges from 2% to 30%&#13;
and varies by bank), which should reduce distortions in the system. However, additional measures are&#13;
needed to level the playing field. For example, the profit tax rate discriminates against the SOCBs, and&#13;
should be harmonized across banks. Provisions for doubtful loans are not tax deductible, leading to&#13;
disincentives for adequate provisioning. The Government is studying these problems with a view to&#13;
finding phased solutions that are politically acceptable and that are budget neutral.&#13;
2.16          In order to encourage competition in the banking sector, the Government has pursued a&#13;
policy of relatively free entry, as a result of which several banks are now operating in the country.&#13;
However, as discussed in Section A, the banking system is heavily dominated by the SOCBs, which are&#13;
hampered by an accumulation of inherited bad debt in their portfolios. As a first step in accurately&#13;
assessing the financial situation of these banks, comprehensive portfolio audits, carried out by&#13;
independent, international auditors, are planned for the four SOCBs and the two joint-stock banks&#13;
participating in the project. The audit of Agribank is underway, and a draft report is expected before end-&#13;
1995. Terms of reference for an audit of Incombank have been prepared with Bank assistance, and that&#13;
audit will be launched in the second half of 1995. Audits of the remaining two SOCBs as well as the two&#13;
joint-stock banks are expected to take place in 1996, and will be financed under the project. These&#13;
reviews will form the basis of concerted portfolio restructuring plans, notably to rid the banks of&#13;
inherited bad loans, and to determine appropriate capital requirements based on an accurate assessment&#13;
of their portfolios.&#13;
2.17          The Government accords a high priority to the institutional development of the banking&#13;
system. Thus, training and technical assistance in modern banking techniques is actively being solicited&#13;
from a host of bilateral and multilateral sources. The largest bilateral donor in this area is the Swedish&#13;
International Development Authority (SIDA), which is funding a multi-year training and technical&#13;
assistance project (Bank executed). This project has been instrumental in providing training to several&#13;
hundred middle and senior bank managers, and has facilitated Vietnamese participation in the SWIFT&#13;
international payment messaging service, as well as in drafting the Check Law. The project has provided&#13;
significant support to the National Payments Council (para. 2.29). Swedish assistance is also funding a&#13;
special audit of one SOCB. German technical assistance is helping to develop a Bankers' Association (an&#13;
independent body representing the profession). Other bilateral donors include France, which is providing&#13;
training in macroeconomics; Australia, which is funding the Agribank special audit; and the Netherlands,&#13;
which has expressed an interest in funding four commercial bank audits in conjunction with the proposed&#13;
project. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is presently undertaking its own Financial Sector Review,&#13;
and has provided some technical assistance in the area of commercial banking and capital markets&#13;
development. The IMF is a significant source of technical assistance to the SBV, and has in place two&#13;
resident advisors who are working with the SBV in the areas of indirect monetary control procedures,&#13;
improvement of supervisory control, and foreign exchange management. The IMF has also provided&#13;
legal technical assistance to support the development of payment systems to complement the Bank's and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
the Government's project preparation efforts. The Bank is assisting in the institutional development of&#13;
the Agribank through the Agriculture Rehabilitation Project (Credit No. 2561-VN).&#13;
2.18          The above activities notwithstanding, there remains a significant need to upgrade the&#13;
institutional and organizational capabilities of the commercial banks, and in particular, the SOCBs. The&#13;
Government is not keen to pursue an all-encompassing, top-down approach in such institutional and&#13;
organizational restructuring. There is likely to be significant resistance to such an approach from the&#13;
banks themselves, and the sheer magnitude of what needs to be done is likely to pose severe absorptive&#13;
constraints. Current Government strategy is to address SOCB issues in a thematic fashion across all&#13;
SOCBs, rather than to undertake the full gamut of organizational, institutional and financial studies on an&#13;
institution-by-institution basis. One reason for such an approach may be Government desire to maintain&#13;
all four SOCBs at similar levels so as not to be seen to be actively targeting any one institution.&#13;
2.19          The Government intends to develop securities markets as part of its financial sector&#13;
development strategy. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has provided significant technical&#13;
assistance to the SBV to put in place the necessary regulatory framework for such development. It is&#13;
expected that a national securities market, trading debt securities in an initial stage, will be operational&#13;
by the end of 1995. Adequate arrangements are required to facilitate the adoption of a delivery versus&#13;
payment methodology for securities trades, thereby ensuring an equitable allocation of risk to all&#13;
participants in a transaction. Such risk sharing is a critical success factor in securities market&#13;
development. The Government's other financial market development activities concern the foreign&#13;
exchange and inter-bank money markets. Adequate financial sector infrastructure, including satisfactory&#13;
payment arrangements, is essential to improve the transactional efficiency of these markets.&#13;
C. PAYMENT SYSTEM: CURRENT STATUS, CONSTRAINTS AND ORIENTATIONS&#13;
2.20          There have been significant improvements in the payment system in the past year.&#13;
Payments within the major cities are now effected within two or three business days, a vast improvement&#13;
over previous clearing cycles of two weeks or more. Nonetheless, the consensus among users is that&#13;
much more needs to be done to foster an effective and efficient system. Government payments between&#13;
agencies, as well as other expenditures, are handled outside the banking system. There is no electronic&#13;
payment of payroll, even in the larger companies. Cash is the predominant means of payment in Viet&#13;
Nam. The heavy reliance on cash has a historical basis, and can in part be traced to the legacy of a&#13;
monobank, which was not geared to serving the individual. High inflation in the recent past has no doubt&#13;
contributed to the public's lack of reliance on the banking system.&#13;
Payment Instruments&#13;
2.21          The range of non-cash instruments is limited at present, and non-cash payments are&#13;
paper-based. The most commonly used non-cash payment instruments are authorized payment orders,&#13;
which account for nearly three-quarters of all non-cash payments, and various forms of bank drafts.&#13;
Individuals have only recently been allowed to open checking accounts, and personal checks are not yet&#13;
widely used. Recent improvements in checks include a more convenient format and color coding by bank&#13;
to facilitate processing. Payment vouchers in denominations of D100,000, D500,000 and D1,000,000 are&#13;
available, with an expiry date six months after date of issue. The denominations are considered too low&#13;
by commercial banks, and too high by certain payees. Payment vouchers are susceptible to fraud, given&#13;
the printing techniques in use. A limited number of paper-based credit transfers takes place. International&#13;
credit cards were first accepted in Viet Nam in 1990, and appear to be increasingly used. Four&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
Vietnamese banks have recently been licensed by Mastercard to issue its cards. One domestic bank has&#13;
recently introduced a local currency card, whose use remains limited.&#13;
Clearing and Settlement Arrangements&#13;
2.22          The SBV has a head office in Hanoi, and maintains a branch in each of the country's 53&#13;
provinces. Each settlement bank is required to hold a settlement account with SBV in each province in&#13;
which it operates. The SBV branches act as provincial clearing and settlement centers for inter-bank&#13;
payments. Intra-provincial (local) inter-bank transfers are made through an exchange of paper documents&#13;
between banks at one, and sometimes two, clearing sessions per day. Checks are verified by issuing&#13;
banks via a physical inspection of the documents, and output lists are used as a basis for posting net&#13;
movement of funds to clearing house accounts, then distributed to participants via paper, diskette or&#13;
modem for input into the banks' customer accounting systems. Inter-provincial (non-local) inter-bank&#13;
payments require the transfer of both electronic instructions and paper documents. The electronic&#13;
instruction is transferred either via a national communications network developed by the SBV's Center&#13;
for Informatics of the Bank (CIB), or the commercial bank's own network. In the CIB network, transfers&#13;
are processed by the provincial SBV branch, which inputs the infornation onto the CIB system. CIB then&#13;
routes the transfer to the appropriate receiving SBV branch. Settlement accounts are debited and credited&#13;
accordingly upon receipt of a copy of the transfer document.&#13;
2.23          Procedures for intra-bank payments depend on the degree of computer support available&#13;
at branch level within the commercial banks and on the size of the branch network. In general, banks&#13;
centralize the processing of inter-bank transfers at one (Hanoi) or two regional centers, and transfer&#13;
requests are made via computer using dial-up links. Branches effect their transfers via their accounts&#13;
with the regional center. In view of its large branch network, Agribank currently organizes its inter-&#13;
branch transfers on a three-tier basis. Within a province, branches act for sub-branches and transfer&#13;
between each other, mainly via the postal system. Inter-provincial transfers are sent via dial-up link to&#13;
regional centers, which in turn process them via accounts held at the head office in Hanoi.'&#13;
2.24          Foreign payments were, until recently, mainly routed through Vietcombank, which&#13;
transmitted them via telex to correspondents. Several Vietnamese banks have recently joined SWIFT,&#13;
and systems have now been set up to allow their branches to transmit and receive foreign payments via&#13;
their respective head offices, with each branch having foreign currency accounts in the head office for&#13;
the posting of transactions. These banks are connected to the SWIFT access point in Singapore at&#13;
present, although there are plans to establish a SWIFT access point in Viet Nam in the coming years.&#13;
Current Payments Volumes&#13;
2.25          The total value of all payments is reported to be six times GDP, which reflects both a&#13;
shallow financial sector and relatively inefficient use of the money supply. In the more developed&#13;
economies of the region, the corresponding figure is around 10, while estimates for developed countries&#13;
(Group of Seven) range from 40-100. Nearly three-quarters of all payments are intra-bank, and over three&#13;
quarters of all intra-bank payments are intra-provincial. The average number of daily inter-bank&#13;
payments is less than 10,000, and about two-thirds are intra-provincial. Payments are concentrated in a&#13;
few provinces and cities (notably Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi). There are signs of very rapid growth in&#13;
Details on the main information flows involved in intra- and inter-bank transactions are available in the project&#13;
files.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
non-cash payments, albeit from low levels: in 1994, the annualized rate of growth in payments averaged&#13;
50%.&#13;
Constraints&#13;
2.26          The underlying weakness of the current Vietnamese payment mechanisms stems from&#13;
the prior needs of a centrally planned economy. The current range of payment instruments and services&#13;
does not fully address the needs of customers for the reliable, confidential, timely and cost-effective&#13;
means of payment that are essential in a market economy. The current payment system is also unable to&#13;
cope with the anticipated significant increase in the volume of monetary transactions that are&#13;
characteristic of the transition process. The insecure and unreliable nature of the present&#13;
telecommunications infrastructure is a severe constraint on electronic funds transmission. The&#13;
commercial banks are reluctant to use the national inter-bank electronic funds transfer network for&#13;
reasons of speed, control and confidentiality. Most inter-provincial payments are achieved by a&#13;
combination of intra-bank and local inter-bank transfers, resulting in payment delays with all the&#13;
attendant consequences.&#13;
2.27          The requirement to fund settlement accounts at the provincial level ties up a significant&#13;
portion of commercial bank resources - resources that could be used for productive purposes - and&#13;
creates severe coordination problems. It is difficult for the banks to optimize the use of settlement funds&#13;
(either for clearing and settlement or for physical cash transactions) on a national basis, since there is no&#13;
effective mechanism for rapid transfer of funds between provinces. An electronic funds transfer&#13;
mechanism would permit the consolidation of settlement accounts at the national level.&#13;
Development Orientations&#13;
2.28          One of the key problems in the development of new payment arrangements is the need to&#13;
harmonize the objectives and goals of the SBV with the comparable objectives and goals of the rest of&#13;
the banking sector. The SBV also has the difficult task of developing and enforcing standards covering&#13;
payment instruments, operating procedures, and rules and regulations. The new payment arrangements&#13;
must be comprehensive and national in scope to meet the payment requirements of the Vietnamese&#13;
economy in an efficient manner. Thus, the improvement initiative must cover local and non-local inter-&#13;
bank payment transactions as well as intra-bank and international transactions. An additional&#13;
requirement is the need for an efficient integration of payment processing with customer accounting and&#13;
settlement accounting procedures.&#13;
2.29          To provide advice on the various tasks to be carried out in modernizing the system, a&#13;
National Payments Council (NPC) was set up in July 1994, consisting of representatives of the&#13;
concerned departments of the SBV, the SOCBs and the banking sector as a whole. In addition, a Bankers'&#13;
Association was established in August 1994. The NPC has established four working level sub-&#13;
committees as follows: (a) Legal &amp; Regulatory and Accounting &amp; Standards; (b) Automation&#13;
(computing &amp; telecommunications); (c) Commercial Bank Modernization; and (d) Payment System&#13;
Operations. These sub-committees provide advice on critical policy and design issues related to their&#13;
assigned area of involvement.&#13;
2.30          The SBV's guiding principles behind the design, establishment and operations of the&#13;
national payments arrangements include: (a) universality of access by financial institutions; (b) cost&#13;
efficiency and self-financing through cost recovery; (c) minimization of payment system risks; (d)&#13;
integrity and reliability; (e) active user participation in all phases of system development; and (f) cost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
minimization in system design through trade-off between the use of new and existing equipment. The&#13;
proposed project has been prepared in accordance with these guiding principles.&#13;
D. THE BANK'S ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
2.31          The Bank is assisting in the development of the financial sector through a variety of&#13;
instruments. Analytical support and policy advice have been provided through two sector reports, the&#13;
first in 1990 shortly after the monobank was dismantled, and the second in 1995. These reports have&#13;
formed the basis of a policy dialogue with the authorities on financial sector development issues. Some&#13;
policy reforms pertaining to the financial sector, such as the removal of the turnover tax and the carrying&#13;
out of portfolio audits for two SOCBs, are being supported through the Structural Adjustment Credit&#13;
(Credit No. 2657-VN). The Bank has been instrumental in mobilizing bilateral assistance for conducting&#13;
these audits, and has assisted the Government in drafting terms of reference for the same. The Bank has,&#13;
since 1992, been involved in training and sundry technical assistance activities through two SIDA-&#13;
financed Banking Sector Training and Technical Assistance projects. The Agriculture Rehabilitation&#13;
Project is supporting the institutional strengthening of Agribank through training and technical&#13;
assistance, and is providing a line of credit for inputs and on-farm development works to private,&#13;
smallholder farm households. A Rural Finance Project is also under preparation, addressing the financing&#13;
needs of the rural poor by improving their access to the formal financial system.&#13;
2.32          Given the direct links between the real sector and the financial sector, a key element of&#13;
the Bank's policy dialogue with the Government has been to stress the need for real sector restructuring&#13;
in conjunction with bank restructuring. The Structural Adjustment Credit is supporting policy reforms in&#13;
the state enterprise sector. In addition, the Bank is executing UNDP-funded technical assistance through&#13;
a State Enterprise Reform Project which is assisting the Government in legal reform pertaining to the&#13;
sector and in implementing a pilot enterprise restructuring and privatization program.&#13;
2.33          The Bank has consistently sought opportunities to coordinate its financial sector&#13;
assistance with that of other donors in order to avoid duplication and to seek synergies between its&#13;
interventions and those of other donors. The proposed project is a good example of that approach: it&#13;
builds on the technical assistance provided to the SBV by SIDA in support of the NPC, SWIFT&#13;
membership and the Check Law, and it incorporates IMF technical assistance in the area of legal advice&#13;
pertaining to payment system development. Agreement in principle has been obtained for bilateral&#13;
cofinancing from the Netherlands to fund external audits of four banks (the remaining two SOCBs and&#13;
the two joint-stock banks that are participating in the project). In addition, the Economic Development&#13;
Institute has provided critical training during project preparation to familiarize the NPC with payment&#13;
system issues.&#13;
E. LESSONS FROM PREVIOUS BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.34          There has been one previous IDA operation with some banking sector involvement in&#13;
Viet Nam - the Agriculture Rehabilitation Project. This project involves, inter alia, a line of credit&#13;
channeled through Agribank, and includes technical assistance for strengthening of this institution. While&#13;
it is too early to draw definitive conclusions from this operation, implementation experience suggests&#13;
that the main project risks relate to the limited institutional experience. The proposed project has been&#13;
prepared bearing this constraint in mind. Lessons from other Bank experience in the payment systems&#13;
area include: (a) the importance of tailoring payment system solutions to the country's geography,&#13;
infrastructure, banking and legal structures, and culture; (b) the need for a formal project management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I1&#13;
structure, with the key involvement of the central bank; (c) active user involvement at both policy and&#13;
working levels in providing direction to the improvement efforts; and (d) a phased implementation&#13;
process whereby the system is extensively tested before "live" operations, i.e., introduced on a pilot basis&#13;
in an initial stage and only fully rolled-out after experience has been gathered in operation. These lessons&#13;
have been taken into account in the design of the proposed project.&#13;
F. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.35         The last Country Assistance Strategy for Viet Nam (Report No. 13545-VN), discussed&#13;
by the Bank's Board on October 25, 1994, indicates that the greatest challenge facing the Govemment is&#13;
managing the transition to a market economy. Modemizing the financial system is a high priority that&#13;
will affect all sectors in Viet Nam, as is recognized in the Country Assistance Strategy, dated October,&#13;
1995. The recent Financial Sector Review identified key bottlenecks in the sector, including high&#13;
taxation of the banks and a weak payment system that discourages the use of the banking system. The&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy further states that one of the highest priorities in Viet Nan is to get the&#13;
financial system to provide basic services to producers, especially private farmers and firms, and to&#13;
mobilize capital now held in liquid forms outside the banking system. Put differently, a key task ahead&#13;
for the Government is to promote confidence in the banking system and make it more customer-oriented.&#13;
2.36         The rapid development of the Vietnamese economy requires the support of a robust and&#13;
efficient financial sector which, in turn, requires an adequate banking sector infrastructure. Efficient&#13;
payment, clearing and settlement systems and the associated legal and regulatory framework are the&#13;
principal building blocks of such an infrastructure. The Bank is uniquely placed to assist the Government&#13;
in the design and implementation of such financial system infrastructure. It has experience in such&#13;
projects and is well-equipped to deal with the variety of policy, design and implementation issues&#13;
involved. It can provide objective "best practice" advice, thereby ensuring that key strategic and policy&#13;
issues involved in the design of such systems are fully taken into account. The proposed project is fully&#13;
consistent with the Bank's broader financial sector strategy that is being pursued through analytical&#13;
work, policy dialogue, lending operations and technical assistance. Furthermore, it complements on-&#13;
going initiatives in private sector development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1           The ultimate objective of the proposed project is to assist in the development of a modem&#13;
banking sector able to service the needs of a growing economy, thereby increasing confidence in the&#13;
Vietnamese banking system. The immediate objectives of the proposed project are to: (a) improve payment&#13;
services in the economy in order to reduce float, speed up circulation of funds and increase efficiency of&#13;
funds transmission, while providing convenience and service to users; and (b) strengthen the institutional&#13;
capabilities of participating banks in order to stimulate commercial bank initiatives to improve internal&#13;
management and customer service.&#13;
B. DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.2           The project consists of four components: (a) a national inter-bank payment clearing and&#13;
settlement system; (b) commercial banks' intra-bank payment systems; (c) commercial banks' institutional&#13;
strengthening and (d) project management support. A schematic description of the project is provided in&#13;
Figure 3.1. A detailed description of the payment system components of the project is contained in Annex 1.&#13;
The first two components (inter- and intra-bank systems) will be procured on a turn-key contract basis&#13;
wherein the contractor will provide the computer hardware, software, training and initial systems operation.&#13;
Thus, although not identified as a separate project component for the purposes of this section, training and&#13;
skills transfer is an integral part of project design and philosophy (see Section E). The commercial banks&#13;
participating in this project have been selected by the SBV on the basis of their involvement in payment&#13;
processing activity: among them, they account for 90% of banking activity in the country.&#13;
National Inter-bank Payment Clearing and Settlement System&#13;
3.3           The national inter-bank payment clearing and settlement system will address the needs of&#13;
both the SBV and the commercial banks and will provide local and non-local inter-bank clearing and&#13;
settlement services. This system will consist of two components: (a) an Inter-Bank Payment System (IBPS);&#13;
and (b) a Settlement Account Processing System (SAPS).&#13;
3.4           The IBPS will handle intra- and inter-provincial domestic inter-bank payments in dong. A&#13;
currency conversion facility will be available for non-dong denominated payments. IBPS will comprise two&#13;
sub-systems: (a) a low value sub-system for credit transfers and pre-authorized debit transfers, able to&#13;
handle batches of items (bulk payments) as well as individual items, operating with a net settlement&#13;
mechanism; and (b) a high value sub-system for credit transfers, providing a real-time gross settlement&#13;
facility for individual time-critical payments.&#13;
3.5           Direct access to IBPS will be restricted to settlement banks, each of which will have a single&#13;
centralized settlement account at the SBV.  For settlement purposes, IBPS will interact with SAPS.&#13;
Participation criteria for settlement banks, covering financial strength, conformity with technical standards,&#13;
and risk management ability, will be established by the SBV (see Section G). A bank without a settlement&#13;
account may participate indirectly via a correspondent relationship with a settlement bank. IBPS has been&#13;
designed to permit access by settlement banks through six provincial processing (clearing) centers as well as&#13;
through the main banking centers of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Any commercial bank that meets the&#13;
participation criteria established by the SBV can use the system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
Commercial Banks' Intra-bank Payment Systems&#13;
3.6           The second component will address the intra-bank and international payments needs of the&#13;
six participating banks: the four SOCBs and as well as two joint-stock banks. There will be a Commercial&#13;
Bank Payment System (CBPS) for each of the six commercial banks (CBs) included within the scope of this&#13;
project. Each system will be able to handle all domestic intra-bank payments, both intra- and inter-&#13;
provincial. The CBPS has been designed to support the different customer accounting organization&#13;
structures (centralized, decentralized, or a hybrid) used by CBs. The generalized CBPS architecture is thus&#13;
capable of accommodating the varying needs of the CBs in their present situation as well as those of their&#13;
future customer accounting improvement plans (para. 3.8).&#13;
3.7           Payment instructions from a CB branch will be electronically transmitted, after validation,&#13;
to the account holding branches for updating of the customer accounts maintained for originators and&#13;
receivers. The stand-alone SWIFT-based international payments facility recently introduced at the head&#13;
offices of the CBs could, in due course, be integrated with CBPS to provide participating branches with the&#13;
ability to send payments to, and receive payments from, foreign correspondents.&#13;
Commercial Banks' Institutional Strengthening&#13;
3.8           The third component of the project consists of: (a) diagnostic reviews of the CBs'&#13;
modernization needs, with particular emphasis on the design of appropriate customer accounting systems;&#13;
and (b) diagnostic portfolio reviews and financial audits of the CBs to determine their true financial&#13;
situation. The introduction of an automated, integrated intra-bank payments and customer accounting&#13;
interface capability provides a sound infrastructure to allow the CBs to implement a range of new banking&#13;
products and other customer services by providing electronic access to customer accounts from all&#13;
participating branches. The diagnostic reviews of the CBs' modernization needs will be undertaken in two&#13;
phases. The first involves the drafting of detailed terms of reference, tailored to the specific situation of each&#13;
CB, which will be undertaken by consultants hired through the PHRD preparation grant (terms of reference&#13;
are contained in Annex 2). It is expected that these consultants will be fielded in December 1995. The&#13;
second phase involves the actual carrying out of the diagnostic reviews for each CB based on the agreed&#13;
terms of reference, which will be undertaken within the project timeframe. Terms of reference for the&#13;
portfolio audits are contained in Annex 3; these will be customized as necessary by each CB.&#13;
Project Management Support&#13;
3.9           The fourth component of the project provides support for project management, consisting of&#13;
consulting services for: (a) procurement of the systems (para. 3.19); and (b) technical support to the Project&#13;
Management Unit (para. 3.18); including vehicles and miscellaneous office equipment.&#13;
C. COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
Project Cost&#13;
3.10          The base project cost is D507 billion (US$45.3 million equivalent), and total project cost&#13;
including contingencies is D674 billion (US$53.9 million equivalent), with a foreign exchange component&#13;
of about 92%, or US$49.6 million equivalent. Physical contingencies represent around 10% of base cost,&#13;
while dong price contingencies represent about 23%. Table 3.1 summarizes the cost estimates by&#13;
beneficiary and component; details are in Annex 4. Base costs are in January 1995 prices, and are derived&#13;
from the most recent equipment, material and labor cost data available for similar, turn-key operations.&#13;
Price contingencies are estimated on the basis of escalation factors of 7% and 6% for local costs for 1995&#13;
and 1996-99 respectively, and 2.6% for foreign costs. The Government of the Netherlands has expressed an&#13;
interest in cofinancing the portfolio audits of the four commercial banks (US$1 million).&#13;

Financing Plan&#13;
3.11          Table 3.2 summarizes the proposed financing plan for the project. IDA financing will&#13;
account for about 81% of the total requirements of US$60.5 million equivalent. The proposed IDA&#13;
credit of US$49 equivalent will finance 99% of the estimated foreign exchange cost and will be made&#13;
to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam at IDA's standard rate for a 40 year term, including 10 years of&#13;
grace on repayment of principal. The SBV, on behalf of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, would be&#13;
the primary implementing agency. Part of the proceeds of the IDA credit would be on-lent to the CBs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
in the amounts shown in Table 3.3, at a fixed interest rate of 6.25%1 per annum, with repayment in US&#13;
dollars over 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years. The dong/dollar foreign exchange risk would&#13;
be borne by the CBs. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that Implementing and On-lending&#13;
Agreements, satisfactory to IDA, setting out the terms and conditions of the on-lending arrangements in&#13;
respect of each CB's improvement plans and providing for CB carrying out of their respective&#13;
components, would be concluded between the SBV and the CBs as a condition of effectiveness of the&#13;
IDA credit. Draft Agreements were reviewed at negotiations and found satisfactory.&#13;

D. IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
3.12         The project will be implemented by the SBV and the six CBs. Project implementation&#13;
procedures will vary by the type of goods and services to be procured. The system contract supplier&#13;
will initially be responsible for the full operation of both inter- and intra-bank systems. The inter-bank&#13;
system will be implemented by the SBV and the supplier in four phases after procurement:&#13;
*  construction, including detailed systems specification on the basis of the technical&#13;
specifications already prepared; site preparation and installation, system testing and&#13;
development of training plans, required documentation and disaster recovery plan and&#13;
drill;&#13;
*  initial pilot, in which the new systems will be installed in selected initial pilot sites,&#13;
new settlement accounts will be established, and parallel running of old and new&#13;
payment systems will be ensured;&#13;
*  pilot expansion, including site preparation for remaining sites, delivery of on-site&#13;
training, further acceptance testing and decommissioning of the old payment system;&#13;
and&#13;
*  operations and maintenance, in which the vendor will operate the new inter-bank&#13;
system for a period of one year after it has been installed in all sites covered by the&#13;
project.&#13;
In parallel, the SBV will finalize the legal and regulatory framework (Section G), operating rules and&#13;
procedures for membership in the new payment arrangements, and telecommunications service&#13;
agreements (Section F). A tentative project implementation plan is contained in Annex 5. Annex I&#13;
contains details on the sites included in the project for both the IBPS and CBPS.&#13;
3.13         The intra-bank systems will be implemented by each CB, and will follow broadly the&#13;
same structure and phases as the inter-bank system. The pace of implementation will depend on the&#13;
individual implementation capacity of the CB concerned. Similarly, expansion of the system beyond&#13;
the sites selected for inclusion under the project will depend on the individual needs and financing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
capabilities of each CB. The institutional development component of the project will also be&#13;
implemented by each CB.&#13;
Project Management Arrangements&#13;
3.14         The proposed project will be a large and complex undertaking, involving many&#13;
different players. Project organization and management plans will need to change over time to support&#13;
the shifting requirements of the project as it progresses from preparation to full operation. The Project&#13;
Management Plan (available in project files) is perforce an evolving document, which will describe at&#13;
any given point the current thinking on project organization and implementation plans.&#13;
3.15         The SBV has ultimate executive responsibility for the project. The NPC (para. 2.29)&#13;
will play an important advisory role in policy formulation, membership rules and guidelines, payment&#13;
system rules and regulations, standards, pricing and cost recovery. Operational support to the various&#13;
SBV departments and CBs will be provided by a Project Manager and a Project Management Unit.&#13;
3.16         Project Management Unit (PMU). The PMU was established in September 1995&#13;
within SBV, and is primarily responsible for: (a) coordinating day-to-day implementation activities; (b)&#13;
administering the IDA credit; and (c) serving as the focal point for Bank supervision activities. The&#13;
PMU has been staffed with appropriately qualified personnel and will be responsible for the planning,&#13;
scheduling and executing day-to-day activities during the procurement, construction and&#13;
implementation phases of the project.&#13;
The PMU will be responsible for the following:&#13;
credit administration: procurement, disbursement, administration of on-lending&#13;
agreements, internal reporting;&#13;
*     translation and interpretation: project translation and interpreter support;&#13;
project planning and monitoring: activity planning, resource management, cost&#13;
control, progress reporting;&#13;
*     risk management and change control: threat assessment and management, project&#13;
change control;&#13;
*     organization and communications: NPC, SBV, CB and third party communications,&#13;
project library; and&#13;
*     key  relationship  management: World  Bank, telecommunications, suppliers,&#13;
consultants, other ministries and agencies.&#13;
3.17         As the project progresses through each phase, the PMU will need to respond to&#13;
changing project requirements, and the relative importance of the different functions can be expected to&#13;
change over time. For example, project planning, organization and communications will be crucial at&#13;
the start of the construction phase, while emphasis will switch to risk management and change control&#13;
once the principal project planning tasks are completed. Logistic support for the PMU, consisting of&#13;
three vehicles and miscellaneous office equipment, will be provided under the project. Assurances&#13;
were obtained at negotiations that the PMU will be maintained with staff in adequate numbers and with&#13;
functions acceptable to IDA, for the life of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
3.18          Resident Advisor. In order to assist the PMU, a Resident Advisor will be appointed.&#13;
This individual would be an experienced technical specialist who would advise the PMU on technical,&#13;
project management and vendor contract matters. Given the complexity of the project and the very fast-&#13;
changing technological environment of computerized systems, it is advisable to have an experienced&#13;
professional during system construction and pilot operation to provide independent advice to the PMU&#13;
on vendor proposed change orders and system design modifications. The SBV is particularly desirous&#13;
of having such support in view of the limited local experience in dealing with foreign vendors and with&#13;
implementing of complex systems. The Resident Advisor will be hired prior to contract negotiations&#13;
with the vendor and so will be available at the very onset of the construction phase. It is crucial that the&#13;
person selected be committed to working in Viet Nam and be flexible enough to respond to the PMU's&#13;
changing needs. Terms of reference for such a person are provided in Annex 6.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
3.19          Procurement arrangements for the project are summarized in Table 3.4, and the&#13;
procedures to be followed are described in Annex 7. Consulting support will be provided to assist the&#13;
PMU in procurement matters. The cost of each item includes its pro rata share of physical and price&#13;
contingencies. The portion of the project not financed by IDA would follow the normal procurement&#13;
procedures of the entity concerned. All consultants will be retained on the basis of qualifications, terms&#13;
of reference, and a selection procedure acceptable to IDA.2&#13;

3.20          About US$43.95 million equivalent of goods and services, or 85% of the IDA credit,&#13;
would be suitable for procurement through a single system contract following international competitive&#13;
bidding (ICB) procedures according to the Bank's procurement guidelines and using the Bank's&#13;
2   In the event that the portfolio audits are financed by bilateral assistance from the Netherlands, qualifications&#13;
and terms of reference acceptable to IDA would be required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
standard bidding documents. In the evaluation of bids obtained following ICB procedures, a margin of&#13;
preference equal to 15% of the CIF price of imported goods or the actual customs duties and import&#13;
taxes, whichever is lower, will be allowed for domestic manufacturers. About 14.6% of the credit&#13;
amount, or US$7.2 million equivalent, would be used for financing consultant services procured&#13;
following the Bank's procedures for the use of consultants. Miscellaneous off-the-shelf, readily&#13;
available goods (including vehicles) with a per item value of less than US$50,000 equivalent would be&#13;
eligible for procurement through national shopping (NS), with a minimum of three quotations, in an&#13;
aggregate amount not to exceed US$1 10,000. Prior review and approval by IDA would be required for&#13;
all bid documents, contract award recommendations and contracts for goods and services procured&#13;
under the project. The total number of procurement packages is foreseen to be: (a) ICB - one package;&#13;
(b) NS - four packages; and (c) consulting services - 12, covering some 500 person-months of services&#13;
for policy and implementation support.&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
3.21         The estimated disbursement of the IDA credit is shown in Annex 8 and summarized in&#13;
Table 3.5. This assumes that the Credit Agreement will become effective by February 1, 1996. The&#13;
project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1999. A credit closing date of June 30, 2000 has been&#13;
established. The credit is expected to be disbursed approximately 5 years after effectiveness based on&#13;
the advanced stage of preparatory work, particularly with regard to the largest contract (85% of credit&#13;
amount). Retroactive financing not exceeding US$4.9 million equivalent of the proposed credit is&#13;
recommended for eligible payments made prior to the date of credit signing, but after the appraisal end&#13;
date of May 12, 1995. These expenditures would concern consulting services and equipment required&#13;
to support the PMU, and will contribute to an efficient start-up of project activities, including bid&#13;
preparation for the system contract.&#13;

3.22         The credit will be disbursed against: (a) 100% of foreign expenditures for goods, 100%&#13;
of local expenditures for goods (ex-factory), and 75% of local expenditures for other items procured&#13;
locally (all for the PMU); (b) 100% of total expenditures for consulting services, excluding taxes; and&#13;
(c) 95% of the system contract supply and installation, exclusive of taxes. (The remaining 5%&#13;
represents local handling, transportation and related costs.) Disbursements for all expenditures would&#13;
be based on full documentation. The SBV will open a Special Account in a commercial bank with an&#13;
authorized allocation of US$500,000 (representing an average of about 4 months' small disbursements)&#13;
to facilitate payments for eligible expenditures. Application for replenishment of the Account,&#13;
supported by appropriate documentation, would be submitted monthly or when the account is drawn&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
down by 20% of the authorized allocation, whichever occurs first. For withdrawals outside of the&#13;
Special Account (application for direct payment or for issuance of Special Commitments), a minimum&#13;
application value of 20% of the authorized allocation of the Special Account would be observed.&#13;
Monitoring, Reporting and Supervision&#13;
3.23          Performance Monitoring. Monitoring of payment system  perfornance is an&#13;
important aspect of ensuring that the system meets the stated needs of users and generates the sought&#13;
after improvements. To help build confidence in the system, a strict daily processing timetable will be&#13;
developed, as will a reporting system to demonstrate realized service levels to participants.&#13;
Performance measures that will be monitored include: system availability, message throughput, delays,&#13;
faults and errors, time-to-repair, and communication service levels and line speed. A detailed list of&#13;
performance monitoring indicators is contained in the Project Management Plan (available in project&#13;
files). A list of implementation progress and development impact indicators is provided in Annex 5.&#13;
3.24          Project Accounts. The PMU will maintain separate project accounts for all project&#13;
components. These accounts will be audited by an independent auditing firm. Audits will be provided&#13;
within 9 months of the close of the Vietnamese fiscal year. Assurances were obtained at negotiations&#13;
that project accounts, audited by a firm acceptable to IDA, will be provided within 9 months of the&#13;
close of each fiscal year.&#13;
3.25          Periodic Progress Reports. The PMU will provide semi-annual progress reports on&#13;
the status of on-going and planned project activities. These reports will be provided by September I&#13;
and March I each year, covering six-monthly activity from January to June and July to December,&#13;
respectively, and beginning March 1, 1996. In addition to physical progress in project implementation&#13;
and the status of key project activities, the progress reports will provide financial information relating&#13;
to expenditures planned, committed and disbursed. The PMU will monitor project performance&#13;
indicators on a regular basis, as described in paragraph 3.23, as well as general implementation and&#13;
development impact indicators as described in Annex 5. For the purposes of the periodic progress&#13;
reports to IDA, the PMU will provide summary statistics on: system availability (percent of normal&#13;
business hours that the system is ready and available for use); total number of payment messages per&#13;
day (including number of messages during the daily peak hour); system performance (number of faults&#13;
and errors in hardware and software per month); and mean time to repair for major hardware and&#13;
software faults. These indicators will be calculated once the testing phase of the project is complete and&#13;
pilot implementation has begun. Cost recovery indicators will also be presented in these progress&#13;
reports (costs, including telecommunications, and pricing structure by payment message type). In&#13;
addition, the PMU will provide any information relating to the project as may be reasonably requested&#13;
by IDA from time to time.&#13;
3.26          Supervision Plan. Supervision of the project by IDA will extend over a period of&#13;
approximately five years (1995-1999). The focus of supervision will change as the project progresses&#13;
through its different phases. In the very early stage, the focus would be on the procurement process for&#13;
systems and technical assistance services, including the establishment of the PMU for project&#13;
implementation. Once the selected vendor has begun system construction, the focus will turn to the&#13;
technical supervision of detailed system design and implementation plans. During this phase of project&#13;
implementation, supervision would also concern the requisite operating rules and procedures and&#13;
organizational arrangements. On the technical assistance side, the focus of supervision would be on&#13;
following up with the selected consultants on the status of the institutional studies and audits. Once the&#13;
institutional studies and audits have been completed, the supervision effort would switch to agreeing on&#13;
the appropriate follow-up to the results of these studies. Supervision of the project would require&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
expertise in payment systems and commercial bank institutional development. At least two supervision&#13;
missions would be required annually over the life of the project, and more frequent supervision support&#13;
should be programmed for the first 18 months of project implementation. Such additional supervision&#13;
effort will be facilitated by coordinating it with other missions to Viet Nam and the region. Bank&#13;
supervision will follow the indicative plan provided in Annex 9, and will require an estimated 70&#13;
staffweeks over the life of the project. Around 19 staffweeks will be at headquarters to review, inter&#13;
alia, procurement actions and progress reports.&#13;
E. STAFF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT&#13;
3.27          Staff training and development is one of the most important factors that will influence&#13;
the success of the project. The vendor will be required to train and develop staff in the SBV and CBs.&#13;
In general, the level of training and development delivered by the vendor must be sufficient to ensure&#13;
that the inter-bank and intra-bank payment systems can be successfully operated and maintained by&#13;
Vietnamese banking personnel after one year of operational support. The training program will be&#13;
mainly focused in three broad areas:&#13;
*      application training will address the needs of technicians and end-users (bank branch&#13;
personnel, systems operators, supervisors and managers) and train them in the use and&#13;
operation of the inter-bank and intra-bank payment system applications;&#13;
*     technical training will cover the skills required to support the installation, operation,&#13;
and maintenance of the computers and telecommunications equipment and services.&#13;
This training will primarily be delivered to technical personnel in the SBV and CBs;&#13;
and&#13;
*      management training will cover the skills necessary to ensure that the new payment&#13;
mechanisms deliver the sought after improvements. This training will therefore focus&#13;
on interpreting and using the information that will be generated by the system.&#13;
3.28         Due to the large numbers of personnel that will be involved, a cost effective approach&#13;
to training delivery will have to be employed. It is envisioned that the training courses and materials&#13;
will be developed and delivered in modular and repeatable units. A "train the trainers" approach may&#13;
also be used as a way to contain training costs. Vendors will be expected to provide a full set of easily&#13;
maintained materials and course notes for each training module. In their proposals, vendors will be&#13;
required to demonstrate that they understand the difficulties and complexities involved in developing&#13;
and delivering a large scale training program in a foreign language in a transitional economic&#13;
environment. The adequacy of the training and skills-transfer program will be an important element in&#13;
the evaluation of the proposals. Through these measures, it is expected that the SBV and CBs will be in&#13;
a position to deliver any required on-going training by the end of the contract period.&#13;
F. TELECOMMUNICATIONS&#13;
3.29         The National Inter-bank Payment Clearing and Settlement component of project is&#13;
critically dependent upon the availability of a secure and robust data communications network. Without&#13;
such a network, the ability to implement an Electronic Funds Transfer system will be severely limited.&#13;
Two options are available to satisfy this need. The banking sector could: (a) build and operate a&#13;
dedicated closed user group data communications network; or (b) procure the necessary data&#13;
communication services from a reputable supplier. Skills availability and economic factors strongly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
support the second option, as it would obviate the need for the banking sector to develop a capability&#13;
that has no real relationship with banking and could be best satisfied by the national&#13;
telecommunications sector.&#13;
3.30         Improving the telecommunications infrastructure is one of the highest priorities of the&#13;
Government, and significant investments are being committed to upgrading physical circuits and&#13;
installing a modern telecommunications infrastructure backbone. According to current plans, there will&#13;
be digital fiber optic and microwave links across the country, digital switches in all 500 districts in Viet&#13;
Nam by the end of 1995, and such switches in all 10,000 villages by the year 2000. Also, Viet Nam is&#13;
in the process of implementing an X.25 data communications network. Viet Nam Post and&#13;
Telecommunications (VNPT) have recently signed a contract with a leading international&#13;
telecommunications company, to procure, install and initially operate a nationwide X.25 data&#13;
communications network. Installation planning is well advanced with equipment delivery expected by&#13;
end-June 1995, initial implementation (6-8 major sites) by September 1995, access nodes in 30 cities&#13;
by the end of 1995, and nationwide coverage completed by the end of 1996.&#13;
3.31         This delivery schedule is in line with and adequately meets the timetable established&#13;
for the IBPS component of the project. The testing of the new payments mechanisms and the initial&#13;
pilot implementations are expected to start in early- 1997, when the X.25 data communications network&#13;
will be in operation in the IBPS pilot implementation sites. The architectural design of the envisaged&#13;
new national payments arrangements is predicated on the assumption that VNPT will provide all data&#13;
communication services required by the SBV and participating commercial banks. These services will&#13;
include the provision of data quality physical circuits from the X.25 switch (owned and operated by&#13;
VDC, the data communication subsidiary of VNPT) to the processing equipment located within the&#13;
payment system participant's premises. Specific communication interface requirements will be&#13;
specified by VNPT. The project includes the equipment to be installed within participants' premises&#13;
necessary to establish the link/interface with the X.25 data communications network. All services and&#13;
equipment required to establish the physical connection from a specific location to an X.25 access point&#13;
will be the responsibility of VNPT/VDC. Minutes of Agreement between the SBV and the Department&#13;
General of Posts and Telecommunications (which oversees VNPT and VDC), signed in September&#13;
1995, provide a clear statement of intent by both parties to purchase or provide, respectively, initial and&#13;
future data communications services required for payment operations. These Minutes were reviewed at&#13;
negotiations and found acceptable.&#13;
3.32         Appropriate pricing arrangements and Service Level Agreements are now being&#13;
negotiated between the SBV/CBs and VNPT. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the&#13;
requisite X.25 data communications capabilities between the eight IBPS and PPC sites will be made&#13;
available by September 30, 1996. Agreements were also obtained that a Service Level Agreement&#13;
describing the data communication service, service level parameters, service level performance values,&#13;
and service credits and other consequences of non-performance would be entered into between&#13;
SBV/CBs and VNPT, on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA, by December 31, 1996.&#13;
G. LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK&#13;
3.33         The SBV attaches great importance to the development of a comprehensive legal and&#13;
regulatory framework to underpin all aspects of the new payments arrangements. Significant work has&#13;
already been accomplished with the advice of the Legal &amp; Regulatory sub-committee of the NPC to&#13;
facilitate the efficient and equitable operation of the payment systems to the benefit of all the&#13;
participants involved. This sub-committee is advising on a series of decrees to ensure that:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
*      the legal structure by which the payment systems are owned, controlled and monitored,&#13;
including provisions governing membership or access to the systems and the&#13;
establishment of their rules and regulations, is soundly based and ensures proper&#13;
representation of all the participants;&#13;
*      procedures and regulations for the day-to-day operation of the systems, especially&#13;
regarding the clearing and settlement timetable and the finality of the payment process,&#13;
are clearly documented;&#13;
*      specific rights attached to existing or newly proposed payment instruments, whether in&#13;
paper or electronic form, or related to the way they are handled and settled, are&#13;
formalized unambiguously;&#13;
*      the participants in the systems, as providers of services and users of instruments, are&#13;
clear as to their rights, responsibilities and liabilities to each other and have statutory or&#13;
similar protection and redress in the event that fraud or mistake by other participants&#13;
results in a financial loss; and&#13;
-      internationally accepted standards, definitions and procedures are adopted to the extent&#13;
possible.&#13;
3.34          Several major documents have been produced and are being readied for formal review&#13;
and modification prior to final action by the appropriate Vietnamese authorities. These authorities&#13;
include: the Governor of the SBV, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of&#13;
Trade and the appropriate Standing Committee of the National Assembly. The primary documents&#13;
include: (a) the Decree Law on Checks; (b) the Regulation on Completing and Auditing Accounting&#13;
Vouchers and Maintaining Accounting Documents; (c) the Regulation on Electronic Fund Transfers;&#13;
and (d) the Regulation on Organization and Technical Procedures for Inter-bank Clearing and&#13;
Settlement Operations (available in project files). A variety of internal and external advisers have&#13;
contributed to the drafting of these major documents, including relevant departments from the SBV and&#13;
commercial banks, international legal firms, and the IMF. Comments from all sources have been&#13;
examined and analyzed to determine their appropriateness to the realities of the Vietnamese&#13;
environment. Prior to implementing the new payment arrangements, the SBV will produce an overview&#13;
descriptive document detailing all the essential factors of interest to payment system participants in a&#13;
single place, thereby obviating the need to reference multiple documents.&#13;
3.35          Participation criteria and membership rules for commercial banks in the IBPS need to&#13;
be established. Typically, these criteria require that participants: be licensed to provide banking&#13;
services in the country; be in good standing, meaning that they are financially sound and have not&#13;
violated any existing rules and regulations; have a settlement account with the SBV; and satisfy certain&#13;
minimum transaction volume requirements. Furthermore, participants are normally required to accept&#13;
and work within any published rules, regulations, standards and operating procedures governing the&#13;
payment system. Draft participation criteria along these lines were reviewed at negotiations and found&#13;
satisfactory. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that participation criteria, satisfactory to IDA,&#13;
would be adopted by the SBV as a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
3.36          Operating procedures for the IBPS are being developed by SBV with advice from the&#13;
Legal &amp; Regulatory sub-committee of the NPC. Typically, such procedures cover: type of items&#13;
processed; entry, storage, release and delivery of payment messages; primary and back-up computer&#13;
facilities; formats and reports; account identification numbers; charges; clearing and settlement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
procedures; liabilities for loss sharing; fraudulent transfers; operating hours; participant requirements;&#13;
system inquiries; and administrative procedures. It is desirable to finalize these operating procedures&#13;
once the system has been designed and tested, and after any implementation issues have been ironed&#13;
out during the initial pilot phase. This would enable experience gained from actual implementation to&#13;
be incorporated into the operating procedures such that a tried and tested set of rules is made available&#13;
to IBPS participants when the system commences "live" operations. According to the present&#13;
implementation schedule, "live" operation of the IBPS is not expected before June, 1997. Assurances&#13;
were obtained at negotiations that drafts of the SBV regulation on electronic funds transfer (para. 3.34)&#13;
and IBPS operating procedures would be prepared and furnished to IDA for comments, and thereafter&#13;
issued by December 31, 1996, taking into account IDA's comments, and that the IBPS would be&#13;
implemented in accordance with such regulations and procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
4. THE BENEFICIARIES&#13;
A. PROJECT BENEFICIARIES&#13;
4.1          The ultimate beneficiaries of the project are the Vietnamese people, who will have better&#13;
payment services, and the Vietnamese banking system as a whole, which will be able to offer secure and&#13;
reliable payment services to its customers. The direct beneficiaries of the project are: (a) the State Bank&#13;
of Viet Nam (SBV) for the inter-bank payment system and for the institutional strengthening of the&#13;
PMU; and (b) the participating commercial banks (CBs) for the intra-bank payment improvements as&#13;
well as for the commercial banks' institutional development component. Four of the banks are fully&#13;
state-owned: the Viet Nam Bank for Agriculture (Agribank), the Bank for Investment and Development&#13;
of Viet Nam (BIDV), the Industrial and Commercial Bank of Viet Nam (Incombank), and the Bank for&#13;
Foreign Trade of Viet Nam (Vietcombank); and two are shareholding banks with public/private&#13;
ownership: the Bank for Foreign Trade of Viet Nam (Eximbank); and the Viet Nam Maritime&#13;
Commercial Stock Bank (Maritimebank). These banks together account for around 90% of banking&#13;
activity in the country.&#13;
B. THE STATE BANK OF VIET NAM&#13;
Organizational Framework&#13;
4.2          The SBV is the country's central bank. Prior to the banking reforms of 1988-89, it was&#13;
the country's monobank, engaging in both central banking and retail credit activities. The State Council&#13;
passed two Decree-Laws in May 1990 aimed at establishing a modem two-tier banking system (available&#13;
in project files). The SBV Decree-Law redefines the organization and functions of the SBV, while the&#13;
Commercial Bank Decree-Law lays out the rules for organizing and operating commercial banks, credit&#13;
cooperatives and state- and privately-owned financing companies. The SBV's retail credit operations&#13;
were hived off into two new state-owned commercial banks, Agribank and Incombank (para. 4.15).&#13;
4.3          SBVs' headquarters are in Hanoi and it has branches in each of the country's 53&#13;
provinces. These branches act as quasi-independent central banks for their particular provinces. They are&#13;
involved in clearing and settling payments at the provincial level, and perform a supervisory function for&#13;
banks within their province. Each provincial branch is headed by a director, and typically has four to&#13;
five departments.&#13;
4.4          The Center for Informatics of Banking (CIB) is a separate organizational unit within the&#13;
SBV system and provides technical support for computerized bank applications. Its headquarters are in&#13;
Hanoi and it has a branch in Ho Chi Minh City. At present, the CIB operates the SBV's electronic&#13;
payment clearing system. The total staff of CIB number 120. The CIB is headed by a director who&#13;
reports to a deputy governor at SBV headquarters. An organizational chart of the SBV is attached to this&#13;
report.&#13;
Budget and Control Procedures&#13;
4.5          The Accounting Department at SBV's headquarters is responsible for, inter alia,&#13;
preparing annual budgets for the SBV system. A draft budget is prepared around September of each year&#13;
for the succeeding fiscal year. The budget process may be characterized as being bottom-up and top-&#13;
down: each of the operational units and branches within the SBV system (numbering approximately 60)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
submit their individual draft budgets, which are consolidated at headquarters, while in parallel, draft&#13;
budgets for the SBV system are prepared by the Accounting Department based on various strategic and&#13;
operational directives at headquarters for items such as credit, foreign exchange and gold purchases,&#13;
personnel and salaries, training, construction and equipment purchases. The draft budget represents a&#13;
fusion of these two approaches. This budget is submitted to the appropriate director-level counterparts at&#13;
the State Planning Committee and the Ministry of Finance around October, and discussions are held with&#13;
these agencies to reach consensus on the draft budget. The draft budget is then submitted to the relevant&#13;
deputy governor, who discusses it with the directors of all the SBV departments to reach another&#13;
consensus on its contents. It is then submitted to higher level representatives of the State Planning&#13;
Committee, the Ministry of Finance and the Board of Administration of the SBV for approval, typically&#13;
in December.&#13;
4.6           Once approved, the total budget for the SBV system is allocated to each individual unit&#13;
or branch. Around 10-15% of the total budget is reserved as contingency at headquarters for adjustments&#13;
during the course of the fiscal year. Once the individual budgets have been received, the branches and&#13;
units are free to make expenditures provided that they pertain to the approved expenditure categories and&#13;
fall within the allocated amounts. Approval from headquarters is required for individual transactions&#13;
exceeding DIOO million for expenditures involving equipment and office supplies, small construction&#13;
works, and the rehabilitation or upgrading existing fixed assets. The Director of the Accounting&#13;
Department is authorized to approve expenditures under D300 million, while the approval of the deputy&#13;
governor concerned is required for per-item expenditures above this amount.&#13;
4.7           Within the allocated categories and prescribed limits, there do not appear to be specific&#13;
government procurement procedures that need to be followed for spending the resources allocated.&#13;
However, all expenditures are subject to internal audit by the SBV. Each operational unit has two to&#13;
three internal auditors who review expenditures (and where applicable, revenues) for their individual&#13;
units. These auditors have a dual reporting relationship: to the director of the branch or unit concerned,&#13;
and to the Internal Audit Department at headquarters. At headquarters, the Internal Audit Department&#13;
undertakes the internal audits of organizational units such as CIB (in addition to the various headquarters&#13;
departments), and may undertake its own audit of certain expenditures at the branch level. In addition,&#13;
expenditures made by the SBV system are subject to Ministry of Finance review at the end of each fiscal&#13;
year.&#13;
Personnel Policies&#13;
4.8           SBV employs 4,900 staff at its headquarters and in its 53 branches.&#13;
4.9           Staff salaries are included in each individual unit or branch budget, and are based on the&#13;
administrative salary scale applicable to the SBV system. The Personnel Department at headquarters is&#13;
closely involved in any staff changes throughout the SBV system. For example, if a branch wishes to&#13;
recruit additional staff, it must obtain the approval of the Personnel Department, which then instructs the&#13;
Accounting Department to increase the salary allocation for the branch concerned. In addition to their&#13;
salaries, SBV staff receive certain bonuses and allowances that, on average, amount to 60% of their base&#13;
salaries. In general, salary levels are low and uncompetitive with commercial banks (including state-&#13;
owned banks).&#13;
4.10          Staff Training. The SBV runs two Banking Colleges which now offer, in addition to a&#13;
general, banking college-level curriculum, specialized short courses for the benefit of the banking system&#13;
at large. They are also the recipients of significant donor assistance, including two SIDA-financed, Bank-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
executed Banking Sector Training Projects. These projects have provided: (a) training in general&#13;
banking practices for middle and senior level managers drawn from domestic banks; (b) programs for&#13;
trainers to enable the Vietnamese to have their own training force; (c) computer skills courses focusing&#13;
on banking applications; and (d) various specialized short courses in key functional areas such as foreign&#13;
exchange transactions, loan appraisal, financial analysis of projects, etc.&#13;
4.11          The SBV is committed to upgrading the skills of its staff, and constantly seeks avenues&#13;
to introduce its staff to modem banking techniques. Training is provided through a variety of means:&#13;
overseas study, through both long-term programs and study tours; in-country courses and seminars run&#13;
by international experts; in-country training offered through domestic universities and colleges; and on-&#13;
the-job training provided by resident experts and through rotational assignments. Specialized training in&#13;
payment systems has been provided in the course of project preparation by EDI. The provision of&#13;
training in areas relevant to system implementation and operation has been built into the proposed&#13;
project by requiring the tum-key supplier to provide the necessary training as part of the contract, and by&#13;
phasing out supplier operation as local staff are trained in the use of the new system (see Chapter 3).&#13;
Financial Performance&#13;
4.12          Selected financial performance indicators for the SBV are shown in Table 4.1. SBV's&#13;
profits rose in 1994 as a result of an increase in income and a sharp decrease in expenditures, explained&#13;
to some extent by an increase in the efficiency of its operations, particularly with regard to foreign&#13;
exchange operations. As a result, the declining trend in SBV's return on assets ratio seems to have been&#13;
reversed. Nonetheless, SBV's capital to assets ratio remains low, and could be a cause for concem if&#13;
there are recurring losses.&#13;

4.13          The SBV is turning its attention to strengthening its accounting practices with assistance&#13;
from the IMF. As with other areas of institutional development, the strengthening of SBV's operating&#13;
and accounting practices is going to take time. As a first step, a chart of accounts has been defined and is&#13;
being implemented; improvements to the chart of accounts based on implementation experience will be&#13;
an on-going process.&#13;
&#13;

C. THE PARTICIPATING COMMERCIAL BANKS&#13;
4.14          The participating commercial banks include the four state-owned banks (Agribank,&#13;
BIDV, Incombank, and Vietcombank) as well as two joint-stock (shareholding) banks (Eximbank and&#13;
Maritimebank). Banks within each group share many common characteristics. The paragraphs below&#13;
present these common features for each set of CBs. Detailed profiles on each CB are contained in Annex&#13;
10.&#13;
State-owned Commercial Banks&#13;
4.15          Organization. Two of the four SOCBs were in existence even during the monobank&#13;
days prior to 1988: Vietcombank, established in 1963 to handle the country's foreign trade finance and&#13;
management of foreign exchange reserves, and the BIDV, established in 1958 to provide long-term&#13;
finance for public works and infrastructure projects, and to serve as the financing conduit for the State&#13;
public investment program in these areas. The other two SOCBs - Agribank and Incombank - were hived&#13;
off in 1988 from the SBV's retail credit departments covering agriculture and industry, respectively. All&#13;
SOCBs operate under their specific charters, and while they still maintain a certain degree of&#13;
specialization based on their historical role, they are by law universal banks and allowed to engage in any&#13;
legal banking activity.&#13;
4.16          All SOCBs are governed by a Board of Directors, which normally meets twice a year to&#13;
establish operating targets and objectives and to examine past performance. The Board is chaired by the&#13;
General Director of the SOCB and includes representatives from the MOF and the SBV as members.&#13;
The General Director appoints Board members contingent on the approval of the Governor of the SBV.&#13;
The General Director is the Chief Executive Officer conducting day-to-day activities and is appointed by&#13;
the Prime Minister at the proposal of the Governor of the SBV.&#13;
4.17          The SOCBs operate branch networks of differing extent, ranging from 17 branches at&#13;
Vietcombank to over 500 at Agribank. In addition, the SOCBs make extensive use of smaller sub-&#13;
branches and transaction offices, which offer a narrower range of banking services and which serve a&#13;
significant resource mobilization function. The degree of autonomy and credit authority varies among&#13;
the banks, and a number of factors usually weigh in credit decisions, including: the size of the branch,&#13;
credit worthiness of the borrower, the size of the loan, the term of the loan, and the nature of the asset or&#13;
project to be financed.&#13;
4.18          Accounting. All SOCBs apply the Commercial Bank Chart of Accounts as mandated by&#13;
the SBV. This accounting framework deviates from internationally accepted accounting principles: the&#13;
treatment of earnings from problem loans is unclear, provisioning for problem loans is minimal or non-&#13;
existent, and there are no guidelines for the consolidation of accounts. The Government mandates items&#13;
as diverse as depreciation expense for equipment to allocation of retained earnings. The portfolio audits&#13;
and diagnostic reviews either underway or planned for the SOCBs will permit a better assessment of&#13;
these accounting deviations.&#13;
4.19         Auditing. None of the SOCBs is subjected, in the normal course of events, to an&#13;
independent external audit. All of them have some form of internal audit procedures, exercised through&#13;
the Comptroller's Department, which monitors compliance with internal policies and regulations. The&#13;
SOCBs have also implemented some form of "off-site" monitoring between headquarters and branches&#13;
wherein branches send in regular reports on credit outstanding, deposits mobilized, etc. All SOCBs are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
subject to SBV supervision, generally on an annual cycle. The MOF provides a certification of SOCB&#13;
accounts on an annual basis, generally within three months of the close of the fiscal year. This&#13;
certification is provided after the MOF has checked compliance with the latest rules and regulations on&#13;
past activity. There is a forward looking element of such financial control wherein the MOF renders an&#13;
opinion on the financial viability of prospective SOCB activities, and ensures their consistency with&#13;
Government directives.&#13;
4.20         Two SOCBs (Agribank and Incombank) are undergoing comprehensive financial audits&#13;
and portfolio reviews as part of the Government's general financial sector development program. Such&#13;
diagnostic reviews for the other two SOCBs (Vietcombank and BIDV) will be undertaken under the&#13;
project for the 1994 and 1995 fiscal years (para. 3.8). Assurances were obtained at negotiations that&#13;
these audits will be carried out in accordance with terms of reference and timing acceptable to IDA.&#13;
These comprehensive diagnostic reviews will enable a better appreciation of the true financial situation&#13;
of all four SOCBs, and will set the stage for portfolio restructuring, asset classification and portfolio&#13;
monitoring. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that financial statements for each SOCB, audited&#13;
by auditors satisfactory to IDA, will be submitted within 9 months after the close of each fiscal year over&#13;
the life of the project.&#13;
4.21         Staffing Policies. Each SOCB has an active program of staff recruitment, with well-&#13;
defined procedures and criteria for selection. In general, new recruits must be university graduates in&#13;
finance, accounting, economics, or banking, and must demonstrate proficiency in a foreign language.&#13;
Basic computer skills are also required. Some SOCBs have rigorous testing procedures and the demand&#13;
for entry-level jobs appears to be quite strong. There appears to be little or no mid-career recruitment.&#13;
The SOCBs are at a competitive disadvantage in recruitment compared to joint-stock banks, and&#13;
particularly foreign banks, due to their rigid, administered salary scales. Although SOCBs are allowed to&#13;
supplement the low base salaries through the payment of bonuses, the maximum amount of the bonuses&#13;
that can be paid is also administratively determined. The bonus ratio is determined on a bank-by-bank&#13;
basis by the SBV and the Ministries of Finance and Labor, and is based on the SOCBs' expected profit&#13;
for a given year. The bonus is distributed equally across a salary grade, and the system does not provide&#13;
particular pecuniary rewards (or sanctions) for performance. There is greater autonomy in promotion&#13;
decisions in recent times, and most SOCBs are now promoting staff based on performance and potential,&#13;
rather than on seniority.&#13;
4.22         Training. All SOCBs recognize the critical importance of providing training to their&#13;
staff in modern banking techniques. All of them participate in the various bilaterally funded training&#13;
programs offered in Viet Nam (para. 2.17), and they all encourage English language training through&#13;
special training allowances and other incentives. Some of the more enterprising SOCBs have set up in-&#13;
country seminars and training programs provided by their correspondent banks. Overseas training is also&#13;
provided to some staff through bilateral programs and similar arrangements with foreign banks, and&#13;
Vietnamese banks have been accessing their correspondent network for this purpose. Such training is&#13;
generally short-term in nature.&#13;
4.23         Taxation Regime. SOCBs are subject to the following taxes: (a) turnover tax; (b) profit&#13;
tax; and (c) a capital use tax. The turnover tax ranges from 2% to 30%, depending on the type of bank,&#13;
and is applied to the interest margin (interest income less interest expenditure). A turnover tax of 6% is&#13;
applied to service and fee income on a gross basis. Turnover taxes are expected to be eliminated as part&#13;
of the structural adjustment program being implemented by the Government. The profit tax rate for&#13;
SOCBs is 45%, applied to net income before any provisions and reserves. The capital use tax is 6% on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
the statutory capital of the bank. "Excess profits" after the payment of these taxes and after the&#13;
constitution of the allowed reserves are turned over to the Government.&#13;
4.24         Provisions and Reserves. The SOCBs' equity accounts include three special funds that&#13;
could be called general and specific reserves. A Bonus Fund consists of funds allocated for staff&#13;
bonuses, while a Welfare Fund to provide for pensions and such, and a Fund for Construction and&#13;
Procurement to finance fixed assets. Reserves for "Risk Prevention" are maintained by each SOCB,&#13;
which is allowed to set aside 10% of net earnings each year for this purpose. However, no guidelines&#13;
have been established as how these funds are to be used to deal with problem loans.&#13;
4.25         Financial Performance. Summary financial performance indicators for the SOCBs (in&#13;
addition to the joint-stock banks) are shown in Table 4.2. Details are available in Annex 10.&#13;
Joint-stock Banks&#13;
4.26         Organization. Eximbank and Maritimebank operate as joint-stock banks. They have&#13;
only been operating since the late 1980s, owing their establishment to the dismantling of the monobank&#13;
system and to enabling legislation that permitted the creation of private banking institutions. Both banks&#13;
concentrate in financing particular commercial sectors: Eximbank focuses on exporting and importing&#13;
activities and Maritimebank works primarily in shipping and telecommunications. Although individuals&#13;
own shares in both banks, institutions comprise the major shareholders. Not surprisingly, trading&#13;
institutions predominate among shareholders of Eximbank, and shipping and telecom firms own most of&#13;
Maritimebank's shares. The shareholders of these banks meet at regular intervals and elect a Board of&#13;
Directors to represent their interests. The Board of Directors selects senior bank officers and exercises&#13;
considerable responsibility in bank policies and operations. Both Eximbank and Maritimebank are fairly&#13;
small, with only a couple of hundred employees each, but both plan extensive expansions. Both banks&#13;
have only a handful of branches, concentrated in the major commercial areas of the country, and both&#13;
have developed extensive corresponding banking relationships.&#13;
4.27         Accounting. Both Eximbank and Maritimebank comply with Vietnamese rules and&#13;
regulations concerning the preparation of their financial statements. However, as noted previously,&#13;
Vietnamese accounting does not necessarily follow internationally accepted principles. In view of this&#13;
fact, Maritimebank has invested considerable time and effort into revamping its accounting systems and&#13;
computer capabilities to allow it to prepare financial statements that follow international norns, and&#13;
these should be available for the 1995 fiscal year.&#13;
4.28         Auditing. Both banks have an internal unit that performs an auditing function. These&#13;
units work to ensure compliance with internal policies and procedures. They function independently&#13;
within the structure of the banks and report to their Boards of Directors. The SBV exercises a&#13;
supervisory role over both Eximbank and Maritimebank, as it does with all banking institutions in the&#13;
country. Neither bank undergoes regular external audits. However, in 1992, Maritime underwent an&#13;
external audit by an international accounting firm from Hong Kong as part of its participation in the&#13;
Vietnam Country Fund. Both banks indicate that the principal reasons for the past lack of external audits&#13;
are inadequate accounting standards and a lack of domestic auditing capacity. Comprehensive portfolio&#13;
reviews and financial audits for the 1994 and 1995 fiscal year will be undertaken under the project.&#13;
Although these banks are new and are not burdened with inherited bad loans facing the SOCBs, such&#13;
reviews will help identify weaknesses in the portfolio and in credit management that need to be&#13;
addressed for the future health and sustainable growth of these banks. They will also provide a measure&#13;
of comfort to potential foreign investors. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that these audits will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
be carried out in accordance with terms of reference and timing acceptable to IDA. In addition,&#13;
assurances were obtained at negotiations that financial statements for each bank, audited by auditors&#13;
satisfactory to IDA, will be submitted within 9 months after the close of each fiscal year over the life of&#13;
the project.&#13;
4.29          Staffing Policies. Both Eximbank and Maritimebank recruit staff using the same criteria&#13;
as the SOCBs. They look for recruits who have a college-level education in a banking or financial&#13;
discipline, who have a facility with a foreign language, and who are computer literate. New recruits at&#13;
Eximbank must undergo foreign language testing and endure a three to six month probation period.&#13;
Maritimebank requires new employees to sit for a formnal examination after an initial training period.&#13;
Eximbank is reportedly required to follow state guidelines concerning its pay structure.  Despite&#13;
supplementing this pay scheme with a system of bonuses, Eximbank cannot compete with salaries&#13;
offered by other private and foreign banks, and bank managers report a serious turnover problem.&#13;
Maritimebank, on the other hand, does not appear to be bound by government dictates in the&#13;
determination of its salary structure, and offers relatively high wages which are further supplemented by&#13;
bonuses. Consequently, employees of Maritimebank can earn appreciably more money than similarly&#13;
skilled staff working at SOCBs. Although managers at Maritimebank report that they still cannot match&#13;
the salaries offered by foreign institutions, they report no significant turnover problems.&#13;
4.30          Training.  Both Eximbank and Maritimebank are committed to enhancing the&#13;
professional qualifications of their staff through training activities. In recognition of this fact, both banks&#13;
report that they contribute considerable financial and human resources to training their staff. Given this&#13;
expense, Eximbank has enacted policies that attempt to recover training costs for staff leaving the bank.&#13;
While most training concentrates on banking topics, foreign language training is also stressed. Both&#13;
banks attempt to satisfy most of their training needs internally, but also utilize external training&#13;
resources. They also provide their managers with limited overseas training, and have been creative in&#13;
locating funding sources to cover the associated costs.&#13;
4.31          Taxation Regime. Both banks pay a profit tax of 45%. However, they are subject to&#13;
different rates with regard to the turnover tax. Eximbank pays a rate ranging from 6% to 25%, while the&#13;
range formn Maritimebank varies from 6% to 1 5%.&#13;
4.32          Financial Performance.  Summary financial data for Eximbank and Maritimebank&#13;
(along with the SOCBs) are shown in Table 4.2. Details are available in Annex 10.&#13;

5. FINANCIAL ASPECTS, BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
5.1          Much is required for efficient financial sector development: a sustained, stable&#13;
macroeconomic environment; sound financial sector policies; and a competitive and well-functioning&#13;
banking system. This project attempts to improve the functioning of the banking sector through&#13;
improvements in basic financial sector infrastructure. A well-functioning payment system is a necessary&#13;
underpinning to efficient financial sector development. A poor payment system can lead to inefficiencies&#13;
in the use of the available money stock, inequitable risk sharing between trading parties, and inadequate&#13;
support for the development of other financial services. Ultimately, a well-functioning payment system&#13;
increases confidence in the banking sector. Confidence in the banking sector can also be increased by&#13;
strengthening the institutional capacities of the banks, and by enabling them to provide a range of new&#13;
banking products and services to their customers. Key first steps in this regard are being provided under&#13;
the proposed project: the carrying out of comprehensive portfolio audits to determine the banks' true&#13;
financial situation, and the development of modernization plans, tailored to the specific needs of the CBs,&#13;
to enable these banks to meet the demands of a fast-growing, market-oriented economy.&#13;
5.2           Section B of this chapter discusses financial aspects related to the inter-bank payment&#13;
system and presents an analysis of cost-recovery scenarios. Section C discusses major project benefits,&#13;
while Section D presents an assessment of project risks.&#13;
B. COST RECOVERY&#13;
5.3          The SBV will operate the inter-bank clearing and settlement systems (IBPS and SAPS),&#13;
incurring investment costs and on-going operating costs. These costs will be recovered by charging&#13;
direct participants (settlement banks) appropriate fees for the services provided. Break-even prices have&#13;
been calculated on the basis of estimated costs and for several scenarios of payment volume growth.&#13;
Growth of payment volumes is likely to proceed in three stages: (a) further increases in the volume and&#13;
value of industrial and commercial transactions, following past trends; (b) an influx of high value&#13;
financial market transactions within the next 3-5 years; and (c) rapid growth in the volume of low value&#13;
personal sector payments in the next 5-7 years. Given the uncertainty regarding the timing of future&#13;
volume increases, the system has been designed to be readily expandable at short notice. In its present&#13;
configuration, the system is expected to accommodate the payment needs of the Vietnamese economy&#13;
until the year 2003.&#13;
5.4          There are two major influences on the rate of growth of non-cash payment volumes:&#13;
*     the rate of economic growth; and&#13;
*     the rate of migration from cash to non-cash payments, driven by the level of confidence&#13;
in the banking system and the technical quality and cost efficiency of payment services.&#13;
5.5          Real GDP growth is forecast at 8% per annum for the rest of the decade, while the&#13;
proportion of Ml (narrow money) to M3 (broad money) is forecast to rise from 56% in 1994 to 85% by&#13;
2000. Currency is expected to make up a lower proportion of Ml than in the past, reflecting greater use&#13;
of the banking system. Most banks are predicting growth in payment volumes of at least 25% per year;&#13;
growth in payment volumes was around 50% in 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
5.6           Total annual inter-bank payment volumes for the period 1995-2003 were estimated from&#13;
a starting point of 300,000 for the last quarter in 1994. Four scenarios of payment growth were&#13;
constructed:&#13;
*      10% growth per annum to 1997; 15% growth thereafter;&#13;
*      10% growth per annum to 1997; 30% growth thereafter;&#13;
*      20% growth per annum to 1997; 30% growth thereafter; and&#13;
*      20% growth per annum to 1997; 60% growth thereafter.&#13;
5.7           System costs are fixed (initial investment and start-up; basic operation and annual&#13;
maintenance) and variable, or volume dependent (additional operating costs as volumes processed&#13;
increase). For a given year and a given scenario, there is a break-even price at which the stream of&#13;
revenues is equal to the stream of costs. This break-even price is for the inter-bank clearing and&#13;
settlement only, and does not take into account the costs incurred by the commercial banks in processing&#13;
payments up to the point at which they enter IBPS as an electronic payment instruction, and on receipt of&#13;
electronic instructions from IBPS. Furthermore, telecommunications costs are not included in the&#13;
estimates pending negotiations with VNPT/VDC; however, rough estimates indicate that they would add&#13;
between US$0.10-US$0.60 per transaction. Table 5.1 shows the results of this analysis for the various&#13;
scenarios described above.&#13;

10% to 1997; 15% thereafter    13.05    5.46    3.46    2.42    1.84    1.47    1.21&#13;
10% to 1997; 30% thereafter    13.05    5.01    2.94    1.91    1.34    0.99    0.75&#13;
20% to 1997; 30% thereafter    10.47    3.80    2.13    1.32    0.88    0.61    0.44&#13;
20% to 1997; 60% thereafter    10.47    3.44    1.77    0.99    0.60    0.38    0.24&#13;
5.8           The above table indicates the range of average prices that must be charged to achieve&#13;
full cost-recovery of the system under the different assumptions of volume growth and at different points&#13;
in time.1 The actual tariff schedule will have to be determined based on the desired differentiation in&#13;
rates for high value, time-critical payments requiring real-time gross settlement and low value bulk&#13;
payments that will be settled on a net basis. Telecommunications costs will also have to be incorporated&#13;
into the tariff structure. It is envisaged that there will be an initial subsidy to encourage use, but that this&#13;
will be recovered within the first few years of live operation. The system will generate a surplus after&#13;
break-even, which could be applied to further system expansion.&#13;
5.9           Even under the most conservative growth scenario, and allowing for full cost recovery&#13;
by 2000, barely four years into implementation, the average price that needs to be charged per&#13;
transaction is US$2.42 equivalent, not including telecommunications costs. Even if the high end of the&#13;
The model divides total cost incurred to date for the design, installation and operation of the system by the&#13;
total number of transactions to arrive at the break-even price for a given year.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

estimates available for telecommunications costs is used, the total cost per transaction is around&#13;
US$3.00. Clearly, the actual prices charged will depend on the type of transaction, and can be expected&#13;
to vary around this average figure. Nonetheless, this average cost should be compared to the present high&#13;
value payment clearing and settlement charge of US$30 per transaction. Uncertainties with regard to&#13;
final investment cost and payment volumes make it difficult to establish a pricing structure and fee&#13;
schedule at the present time. However, SBV's guiding principles are: (a) full cost recovery of fixed and&#13;
variable investment, operating and maintenance costs; (b) full cost recovery in a 5-7 year timeframe,&#13;
with an interim target of 70% cost recovery by 2000; and (c) differentiated pricing of payment services&#13;
depending on their time-criticality, value and settlement procedure. These principles are acceptable.&#13;
Assurances were obtained that the pricing structure and fee schedule would follow agreed principles.&#13;
C. BENEFITS&#13;
5.10          The major project benefits relate to the alleviation or elimination of payment system&#13;
related problems facing the banking sector at the present time.&#13;
5.11          The decentralization of SBV settlement obliges the banks to keep multiple current&#13;
accounts at each branch of the SBV, thereby tying up funds and increasing costs. The existing clearing&#13;
procedures do not allow a window before final clearing during which banks could cover deficits or place&#13;
surpluses on an inter-bank basis. No information concerning settlement account status is available during&#13;
the day. Because of these constraints, treasury management within the commercial banks is&#13;
impracticable and inter-bank money market activity is marginal. The proposed project addresses these&#13;
problems. At present, non-statutory balances held by the banking sector at the SBV amount to 12% of&#13;
total deposits (in addition to the required reserves of 10%), or close to D3 trillion. With the new system,&#13;
settlement accounts will be centralized, thus facilitating better treasury management and freeing up&#13;
resources that can be used for productive purposes. The centralization of settlement accounts will also&#13;
give a boost to the fledgling inter-bank market as banks rationalize their liquidity management.&#13;
5.12          Payment processing procedures are inefficient in that significant delays continue to&#13;
occur and result in uncertainty as regards to payment finality. Payment delays will be significantly&#13;
reduced under the proposed project, and float in the system will be reduced as a result. Float increases&#13;
intermnediation costs, and large and unpredictable float levels influence short-term liquidity in the&#13;
economy, thereby introducing additional uncertainty in controlling monetary aggregates. Even if only&#13;
25% of the total value of payments in the economy go through the banking system, one day's float in the&#13;
clearing and settlement cycle represents 0.5% of GDP. Under the proposed project, high value payments&#13;
would be processed in real time, rather than the present 2-3 days. For small value payments, the clearing&#13;
and settlement cycle will be reduced from up to 15 days at present to 1-2 under the new arrangements.&#13;
5.13          The choice of payment instruments is limited and does not meet modem requirements.&#13;
Modem payment systems will enable banks to develop new products (such as card-based consumer&#13;
systems) which can attract customers into the banking system and which can become an important&#13;
source of fee income. A strengthening of the intra-bank payment mechanisms will provide an effective&#13;
vehicle for developing the skills of CB personnel in essential management and bank operational&#13;
processes. The institutional development studies financed under the project will enable the CBs to&#13;
introduce customer accounting improvements. With centralized customer account management, CBs will&#13;
enhance their ability to offer good quality customer services. Improvements in operational efficiency and&#13;
customer service will improve the image of the banking sector, especially the image of the SOCBs. The&#13;
carrying out of audits will be the first step in assessing the true financial situation of the banks, and will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
enable these banks to present their financial statements in internationally recognized form. This will&#13;
increase the confidence of private investors in these banks. In the case of the joint-stock banks, this will&#13;
facilitate tapping foreign investors for capital.&#13;
5.14          Project preparation has provided a sound basis for developing the essential legal and&#13;
regulatory framework for clarifying the rights and responsibilities of all parties in regard to the&#13;
processing of payments transactions. This work is well advanced and, when enacted through decrees&#13;
and/or regulations, will provide significantly increased user confidence in the banking system. In&#13;
addition, the necessary standardization of payment instruments, bank/branch identifier codes, currency&#13;
codes and payments transaction processing methods will provide a sound basis for the design of efficient&#13;
payment and customer accounting procedures in all financial institutions within Viet Nam, and is being&#13;
welcomed by these institutions.&#13;
D. RISKS&#13;
5.15          There are risks associated with every large and complex system development project,&#13;
and the proposed project is no exception. Threats to the success of the project are those events that might&#13;
result in an undesirable change to the project plan and implementation strategy. Formally identifying the&#13;
major threats, assessing their potential impact and formulating plans and strategies to eliminate or reduce&#13;
their impact are key elements of effective risk management. Such threats can stem from external sources,&#13;
internal sources, and the project structure and scope. Against this backdrop, the major threats facing the&#13;
project have been identified and steps have been taken to manage the associated risks, as noted in the&#13;
following paragraphs.&#13;
5.16          Inadequate cooperation between the several stakeholders in the project could result in a&#13;
lack of commitment and failure to realize project objectives. Project preparation has fully involved the&#13;
various stakeholders, and the project has received the approval of the various parties involved. The&#13;
established organizational structures will continue to be used for the procurement, construction and&#13;
installation phases of the project. The roles, responsibilities, working level inter-relationships, and&#13;
authorities of the NPC, its various sub-committees and the PMU as defined in the Project Management&#13;
Plan, will ensure the active involvement of all key parties to the project in making critical decisions.&#13;
5.17          A major project risk relates to the procurement process. The award of large contracts for&#13;
computer hardware and software is technically complex, and needs to be carefully managed. This risk&#13;
has been minimized in the proposed project through the design of a transparent system for procurement&#13;
under a turn-key contract and through the provision of consultants to assist in the evaluation process.&#13;
Procurement based upon incorrect transaction volumes and inaccurate descriptions of currently installed&#13;
equipment could result in sub-optimal purchasing decisions. Steps are being taken to ensure that the&#13;
necessary information is obtained and referenced appropriately in the bidding documents. This will&#13;
ensure that the new arrangements make optimum use, as far as is practical, of all existing equipment and&#13;
that the capacity of newly acquired equipment is in line with real needs.&#13;
5.18          Incomplete understanding of the payment system requirements and their technical and&#13;
operational implications could result in sub-optimal decisions and a negative impact on overall system&#13;
quality. To avoid this threat and to ensure the medium-term availability of all essential skills and&#13;
knowledge, the agreed acquisition strategy makes provision for the successful vendor to both operate and&#13;
support the new payment arrangements for a period of one year after full system implementation as well&#13;
as providing comprehensive training to relevant Vietnamese personnel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
5.19         Inadequate project management and procurement skills could result in project delays,&#13;
cost over-runs and adverse changes in project scope. Steps have been taken to limit these risks through&#13;
the establishment of the PMU, the production of a Project Management Plan defining key&#13;
implementation actions, the training of key PMU personnel, and the recruitment of a Resident Advisor&#13;
and experienced procurement phase consulting support.&#13;
5.20         Pressure to implement changes in project scope during the construction phase of the&#13;
project could result in delays and cost increases. In any development project, the cost of making changes&#13;
increases as the project proceeds, and in a turn-key procurement, vendors may request excessive payment&#13;
for implementing the requested changes. Steps are being taken to ensure that a well defined change&#13;
control function is built into the PMU to ensure that only essential changes are accepted for action and&#13;
that implementation is undertaken in a controlled manner. In order to supplement the technical&#13;
capabilities of PMU staff in this area, an experienced Resident Advisor will be recruited to provide the&#13;
necessary expertise.&#13;
5.21         Inappropriate arrangements for the provision of data communications services from&#13;
VNPTNDC could result in project delays and excessive costs. Steps have been taken to prepare the&#13;
PMU for the negotiations with VNPTNDC. Minutes of Agreement between the SBV and the&#13;
Department General of Posts and Telecommunications record the intent of both parities to purchase and&#13;
provide, respectively, the required data communications services. Since the implementation of&#13;
telecommunications improvements is well advanced and expected to be completed by end-1995, and&#13;
given that actual payment system operation is not expected before mid-1996 at the earliest, it is unlikely&#13;
that the lack of availability of data communication services will be a constraint on project&#13;
implementation. Nonetheless, the definition of contingency plans in the event that the necessary data&#13;
communications services are delayed will be required as part of the vendor proposals.&#13;
5.22         Delays in the construction of the primary and backup sites for the new inter-bank system&#13;
could hold up project implementation. However, since new buildings are not essential to house the new&#13;
systems, the fall-back option of using existing facilities should mitigate this risk.&#13;

VIET NAM&#13;
PAYMENT SYSTEM AND BANK MODERNIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Description of Payment System Components of the Project&#13;
A. NATIONAL INTER-BANK PAYMENT CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEM&#13;
1.           The national inter-bank payment clearing and settlement system will address the&#13;
needs of both the SBV and the commercial banks, and will provide local and non-local inter-&#13;
bank clearing and settlement services to satisfy financial sector needs for the next eight years.&#13;
This system will consist of two components: an Inter-Bank Payment System (IBPS) and a&#13;
Settlement Account Processing System (SAPS). Figure I provides a schematic description of the&#13;
scope of the new payment arrangements.&#13;
2.           The Inter-Bank Payment System (IBPS) will be able to handle all domestic&#13;
inter-bank payments, both intra- and inter-provincial , in Vietnamese dong. IBPS will comprise&#13;
two sub-systems: (i) a low value sub-system for credit transfers and pre-authorized debit&#13;
transfers, able to handle batches of items (bulk payments) as well as individual items, operating&#13;
with a net settlement mechanism; and (ii) a high value sub-system for credit transfers, providing&#13;
a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) facility for individual time-critical payments (see Figure 2).&#13;
3.           Direct access to IBPS will be restricted to settlement banks, each of which will&#13;
have a single centralized settlement account at the SBV. For settlement purposes, IBPS will&#13;
interact with the SAPS. Participation criteria for settlement banks, covering financial strength,&#13;
conformity with technical standards, and risk management ability, will be established by the&#13;
National Payments Council. A bank without a settlement account may participate indirectly via&#13;
a correspondent relationship with a settlement bank.&#13;
4.            Each participating commercial bank will enter payment instructions into IBPS&#13;
via data entry terminals at its branches. Having been validated on input, these instructions will&#13;
be transmitted to a Provincial Processing Center (PPC) for automated clearing and routing to the&#13;
bank branches of the recipients. A currency conversion feature will be available to handle non-&#13;
dong denominated payments. Electronic data transmission between the participants will be&#13;
achieved by using the VNPTNDC X.25 data communications network. As a fall-back option,&#13;
there will be a facility for both magnetic diskette and paper-based message entry and distribution&#13;
at each PPC. Commercial bank will have alternative routing options for inter-bank payments (see&#13;
Figure 4).&#13;
5.           Multilateral netting of low value payments at each PPC will occur at designated&#13;
times, initially end-of-day. (see Figure 3). On completion of the netting process, settlement&#13;
requests will be submitted to SAPS at the National Settlement Center (NSC). An individual&#13;
settlement request will be generated and submitted immediately to SAPS for each high value&#13;
payment received at a PPC. SAPS will make postings to settlement accounts unless there are&#13;
insufficient funds on the account to be debited and the funding requirement cannot be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40                                  Annex 1&#13;
accommodated with the bank's intra-day overdraft limit, in whicih case the settlement request&#13;
will be held in a queue pending receipt of funds.&#13;
6.            The automation of inter-bank payments clearing and settlement presents the&#13;
SBV with important policy issues. The participation criteria for settlement banks, the volume&#13;
and timing of inter-bank payment flows, and the availability of intra-day liquidity will have&#13;
implications for systemic risk and the cost-efficiency of the payment system as a whole. The&#13;
IBPS has been designed to permit changes in policy (for example, changes in settlement reserve&#13;
levels) to be implemented without difficulty. The IBPS has also been designed using a modular&#13;
architecture and thus can easily accommodate expansion in payments transaction volumes as&#13;
well as geographical coverage. Discussions on the essential policy issues have been initiated&#13;
with relevant NPC personnel and broad agreements have been reached on the initial positions to&#13;
be adopted.&#13;
7.            The inclusion of an RTGS capability will support the existing small number of&#13;
time critical payments transactions and will further support: (i) the needs of emerging inter-bank&#13;
money market transactions; (ii) the needs of a delivery-versus-payment approach to clearing and&#13;
settling securities markets transactions; and (iii) a payment-versus-payment approach to foreign&#13;
currency transactions.&#13;
8.            The technical design of the IBPS includes appropriate backup capability of all&#13;
critical components and processes, and accommodates the long tern data storage requirements&#13;
specified in relevant SBV regulations. In summary, the IBPS will provide an efficient, reliable,&#13;
secure and cost-effective solution to the present and medium term future needs of the&#13;
Vietnamese financial sector for inter-bank payments.&#13;

B. COMMERCIAL BANK'S INTRABANK PAYMENT SYSTEMS&#13;
9.            The second major component of the project will address the payments needs of&#13;
the four state-owned commercial banks as well as two share holding banks. The system has been&#13;
designed to provide intra-bank and international payments services to satisfy the needs of their&#13;
customers for the next eight years. The project will develop a separate Commercial Bank&#13;
Payment System (CBPS) for each of the six commercial banks included within the scope of this&#13;
project (see Figure 2). Each system will be able to handle all domestic intra-bank payments,&#13;
both intra- and inter-provincial. Initially, the main payment types will be credit transfers and&#13;
pre-authorized debit transfers, principally bank drafts and direct debits. Electronic payment&#13;
instructions derived from checks using truncation techniques and card-based transactions will be&#13;
added in due course.&#13;
10.           Each participating commercial bank branch will enter payment instructions into&#13;
the CBPS via a data entry terminal. Electronic data transmission will be achieved through the&#13;
VNPTNVDC X.25 data communications network. Delivery from and to the more remote&#13;
branches can be achieved by using dial-up modem links. The system has been designed to&#13;
support the X.28 dial-up capability and thus remote branches can have a seamless access to the&#13;
national X.25 services. Payment instructions may be checked/validated at the originating branch&#13;
with reference to limits set by that branch or by a controlling branch at a district/provincial level&#13;
or indeed by the bank's head office. After validation, these instructions will be transmitted to the&#13;
account holding branches for updating of the customer accounts maintained for originators and&#13;
beneficiaries.&#13;
11.           The CBPS  has been designed to  support several customer accounting&#13;
organization structures including: (i) a fully centralized customer accounting structure; (ii) a&#13;
completely decentralized customer accounting structure; and (iii) a hybrid structure with&#13;
centralization at the provincial level (see Figure 1). Thus, the generalized CBPS architecture&#13;
will satisfy the varying needs of the several participating banks, as well as other prospective&#13;
participants.&#13;
12.           The stand-alone S.W.I.F.T.-based  international payments facility recently&#13;
introduced at the head offices of the commercial banks can be integrated with CBPS, to provide&#13;
participating branches with the ability to send payments to, and receive payments from, foreign&#13;
correspondents.&#13;
13.           The introduction of an automated, integrated intra-bank payments and customer&#13;
accounting interface capability provides a sound infrastructure for use by the participating banks&#13;
in implementing a range of new banking products and other customer services by providing&#13;
electronic access to customer accounts from all participating branches.&#13;

C. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT&#13;
14.           The overall technical objective of the payment system design is to provide a&#13;
modular and structured system architecture which follows best international practice. The&#13;
payment system consists of three integrated but independent components: (i) an applications&#13;
component: the software that provides the required business functions; (ii) a communications&#13;
component: the telecommunications networks which are used to transfer data electronically&#13;
between applications held in different physical locations. Separate networks exist for the inter-&#13;
bank and intra-bank payment systems, and there is one intra-bank network for each participating&#13;
commercial bank; and (iii) a processing component: the computers and other devices which run&#13;
the applications software.&#13;
15.           In line with modern design practices, a number of key design principles have&#13;
been followed. These are described in summary terms in the following paragraphs.&#13;
*  Application Independence. The application software modules will be independent&#13;
of both the communications and processing architectures. This will (i) help ensure&#13;
system data confidentiality, (ii) ease application software maintenance; and (iii)&#13;
allow for separate business decisions regarding the choice of communications&#13;
carrier, the introduction of new applications and the location of application&#13;
processing.&#13;
* Open System Architecture. International public standards (CCITT X Series) have&#13;
been used to ensure: (i) independence from vendors and their proprietary standards;&#13;
(ii) a wide choice of potential vendors; and (iii) ease of implementation and system&#13;
stability.&#13;
*  Common Communications Network. A network such as that being provided by&#13;
VNPT/VDC will provide reliable, secure and cost-effective data message and file&#13;
transfer capabilities using the X.25 access protocol.&#13;
*  Common Standards. These cover file and message formats, the identification of&#13;
banks, bank branches and accounts to ensure: (i) inter-operability; (ii) ease of&#13;
making changes to the system; (iii) ease of implementing new participants and new&#13;
branches; and (iv) overall efficiencies.&#13;
*  Modularity. This is to ensure that different applications or application modules can&#13;
be located on different computers at different locations depending on volumes and&#13;
organizational requirements.&#13;
*  Security and Integrity. The system must be secure, reliable and readily available&#13;
for use by participants. Consequently, its design incorporated the following: (i)&#13;
terminal access controls; (ii) file access controls; (iii) validation controls; (iv)&#13;
identification, certification and authentication; (v) software upgrades and&#13;
downloading; (vi) communications (Encryption/Closed User Groups); (vii)&#13;
certification of interfaces; (viii) confidentiality (of specific data); (ix) payment&#13;
message integrity (acknowledgments/sequence checks/time stamping, etc.); (x)&#13;
physical security; (xi) monitoring and measurement processes; and (xii) audit trails&#13;
to allow monitoring and tracing of every system event.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47                                 Annex 1&#13;
Reliability and Performance. As with all essential banking systems, care has been&#13;
taken to ensure that the system allows for: (i) ease of exception handling to permit&#13;
the rigorous treatment of such matters as validation errors, authentication failures,&#13;
and hardware and software faults; (ii) high levels of overall availability in the 99.5 %&#13;
plus region; and (iii) protection against major disruptions (disaster recovery) such as&#13;
natural disasters, but also covering such matters as loss of power supply or first level&#13;
communications.&#13;
16.          In addition to addressing the specific needs of the banking sector for secure,&#13;
reliable and cost-efficient payment systems, the project has been designed, at the request of the&#13;
owner, to provide an upgraded overall computing capability in designated branches of the SBV&#13;
and participating commercial banks. This has been accomplished by specifying additional&#13;
processing, communications and storage capacity to support existing and new application&#13;
systems. The technical architectures have been designed to permit modular expansion. Thus the&#13;
processing equipment which make up the architectures in the designated upgraded branches can&#13;
be further upgraded as capacity needs change. These upgrades can be accomplished through on-&#13;
site changes and thus can be made without disruption of services to existing users.&#13;
17.          The detailed user requirement specifications will be described in the project&#13;
bidding documents. These requirements will permit qualified vendors to offer best practice&#13;
solutions to satisfy the needs of the Vietnamese banking sector. In addition, care has been taken&#13;
to ensure that vendor solutions will make optimum use of the existing equipment that has been&#13;
purchased by the SBV and participating commercial banks during recent years.&#13;
18.          Schematic presentation of the processing architectures of the NSC, PPC, CBPC&#13;
and a typical CB branch are shown in Figures 5-8, respectively.&#13;

D. TELECOMMUNICATIONS SUPPORT&#13;
19.          The payment systems component of the project is critically dependent upon the&#13;
availability of a secure and robust data communications network. Without such a network, the&#13;
ability to implement an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) system will be severely limited.&#13;
20.          Over recent years, the Government of Viet Nam  has demonstrated that&#13;
improving the telecommunications infrastructure is one of its highest priorities. Significant&#13;
investments are being made in upgrading physical circuits and installing a modem&#13;
telecommunications infrastructure backbone. Current plans contemplate a digital fiber optic and&#13;
microwave links across the country, digital switches in all 500 districts in Viet Nam by the end&#13;
of 1995, and such switches in all 10,000 villages by the year 2000. In addition, Viet Nam is in&#13;
the process of implementing an X.25 data communications network. Viet Nam Post and&#13;
Telecommunications (VNPT) has recently signed a contract with Sprint International, a leading&#13;
international telecommunications company, to procure, install and initially operate a nationwide&#13;
X.25 data communications network. Installation planning is well advanced with equipment&#13;
delivery expected by end June 1995, initial implementation (6-8 major sites) by September 1995,&#13;
access nodes in 30 cities by the end of 1995, and nationwide coverage by the end of 1996.&#13;
21.          This delivery schedule is in line with and adequately meets the timetable&#13;
established for the payment systems component of the proposed project. The testing of the new&#13;
payments mechanisms and the initial pilot implementations will not start until the first quarter of&#13;
1996 at the earliest. Banking sector confidence in the delivery and successful operation of the&#13;
data communications network is likely to be enhanced through the contractual arrangements&#13;
between VNPT and Sprint International.&#13;
22.          Based upon the above, the architectural design (see Figure 9) of the envisaged&#13;
new national payments arrangements is predicated on the assumption that VNPT will provide all&#13;
data communication services required by the SBV and participating commercial banks. These&#13;
services will include the provision of data quality physical circuits from the X.25 switch (owned&#13;
and operated by VDC, the data communication subsidiary of VNPT) to the processing equipment&#13;
located within the payment system participants premises. The payment system participant&#13;
equipment will be  owned and operated by the respective SBV and commercial bank&#13;
participants. Specific communication interface requirements will be specified by VNPT.&#13;
23.          The scope of the payment systems component for data communications&#13;
equipment will be limited to the equipment to be installed within participants' premises&#13;
necessary to establish the link/interface with the X.25 data communications network. All&#13;
services and equipment required to establish the physical connection from a specific location to&#13;
an X.25 access point will be the responsibility of VNPTNDC.&#13;

E. IMPLEMENTATION AND MIGRATION&#13;
24.           Modernization of the payment systems will be undertaken in four stages: (i) the&#13;
construction and successful operation of a 'testbed' for the payment systems to ensure that all&#13;
aspects of the initial new arrangements are appropriately tested in a controlled environment; (ii)&#13;
successful demonstration of all key aspects of the arrangements in a carefully planned and&#13;
executed initial pilot, which will test all aspects of the new arrangements in a real life operating&#13;
environment; (iii) the controlled roll-out of the new payment systems to additional SBV and CB&#13;
branches in the "first pilot network expansion"; and (iv) operation and maintenance of the new&#13;
systems for one year after the first pilot expansion.&#13;
25.           The location of the inter-bank testbed will be Hanoi. The location of each of the&#13;
six intra-bank system testbeds will be in each of the CB's respective Processing Centers. The&#13;
following will be provided for the testbed sites:&#13;
software development/modification and testing of the new systems;&#13;
*   test and certification of new  software releases or upgrades prior to their&#13;
installation into the live active systems;&#13;
*   operational, maintenance and support (help-desk) services for the live systems;&#13;
*   education, training and support services for SBV  and commercial bank&#13;
personnel; and&#13;
*   sufficient functionality to facilitate detailed and comprehensive testing.&#13;
26.           During each pilot, the existing payment mechanisms will run in parallel until the&#13;
new systems are proven. The initial pilot will cover:&#13;
*   establishment of an appropriate operating and administrative organization;&#13;
*   installation of the necessary equipment;&#13;
*   training of necessary personnel; and&#13;
*   establishment of a review group to monitor and report progress.&#13;
27.           The IBPS Initial Pilot will run for at least three months, and will include:&#13;
*   creation of a national settlements center (NSC) in Hanoi and at the back-up site;&#13;
*   development of the IBPS application software;&#13;
*   upgrading of the Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City SBV branches to become&#13;
Provincial Processing Centers (PPCs) to handle electronic inter-bank payments;&#13;
*   creation of the pilot inter-bank network linking the NSC and PPCs to the X.25&#13;
data network;&#13;
*   connection of a number of CB branches to the inter-bank payment system&#13;
network; and&#13;
*   connection of CB head offices, via their CB processing centers, to the inter-bank&#13;
payment system network.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55                               Annex 1&#13;
28.          The intra-bank payment systems initial pilot will include:&#13;
*   upgrading the processing capabilities of the CB headquarters and its processing&#13;
center;&#13;
*   upgrading the processing capabilities of a number of CB branches as follows:&#13;

=_________  ___________________  Phong, Vung  Tau&#13;
*   development, integration and implementation of intra-bank payment system&#13;
software, including the interface to customer accounting systems;&#13;
*   creation of a pilot intra-bank network linking the CB branches to the CB&#13;
processing center; and&#13;
*   connection of any upgraded CB branches in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City to the&#13;
PPCs, thereby giving them direct access to the IBPS.&#13;
29.          Following the successful completion of each initial pilot, both systems will be&#13;
extended to include other branches and locations in the First Pilot Expansion phase. For the&#13;
IBPS, the pilot expansion will occur over twelve months to cover:&#13;
*   upgrading SBV branches in Hai Phong, Danang, Vung Tau, Can Tho, Nghe An,&#13;
and Nam Dinh to handle electronic inter-bank payments;&#13;
*   expanding the inter-bank network to link all the newly upgraded SBV branches;&#13;
and&#13;
*   providing additional local communications to connect CB  branches into the&#13;
IBPS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56                               Annex 1&#13;
The intra-bank pilot expansion will include:&#13;
upgrading the processing capabilities of additional CB branches as follows:&#13;
Bank                         Number of Branches at&#13;

Vietcombank                17&#13;
*   expanding the intra-bank network; and&#13;
*   connecting the upgraded CB branches into the upgraded SBV branches thereby&#13;
giving them access to the IBPS.&#13;
30.          Following the successful completion of the pilot expansion, it will be possible to&#13;
include other commercial banks, and additional branches of the CBs, in the IBPS. Each new&#13;
participant will need to meet the membership criteria established by the NPC. However, for the&#13;
next few years, there will be banks that will continue to rely on existing paper/manual payment&#13;
mechanisms, and it will be necessary to support existing payment methods during the&#13;
implementation of the new systems and for a period during their subsequent operations.&#13;
31.          Settlement Accounts. At the start of the initial pilot, a national settlement&#13;
account will be created at the NSC for each commercial bank. During the implementation period,&#13;
each bank will need to maintain a settlement account at the SBV head office (NSC) and a&#13;
separate settlement account at each SBV branch to support the current method of payments. As&#13;
the IBPS is rolled out, the commercial banks can migrate to full electronic payments and thereby&#13;
reduce or eliminate their holdings of settlement balances at the SBV branches.&#13;
32.          The vendor will provide full-time, on-site operational support at sites to be&#13;
designated for each of the seven sub-projects (SBV and six CBs). This support will be provided&#13;
during implementation and for one year following the first pilot network expansion.&#13;

VIET NAM&#13;
PAYMENT SYSTEM AND BANK MODERNIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Commercial Bank Improvement Specification and Scoping Studies&#13;
Consultant Terms of Reference for Study Definition Mission&#13;
Background&#13;
1.          Initial steps have been taken by the six commercial banks participating in the&#13;
payments systems modernization project to develop an Information Technology (IT) Strategy to&#13;
support their evolving business and banking needs. The commercial banks recognize that future&#13;
business success will require a capability to respond rapidly to changing internal and external&#13;
needs for information based services and decision support mechanisms within an acceptable cost&#13;
and pricing structure.&#13;
2.           The on-going technical infrastructural investments in Viet Nam will provide a&#13;
basis for carefully paced information technology based changes. Typical areas within the&#13;
commercial banks that are targeted for improvement include the centralization of customer&#13;
accounts, the development of customer information records, improved treasury operations for&#13;
enhanced financial planning and control, as well as customer, portfolio and liquidity risk&#13;
management and the development of consolidated approaches to cash management. In summary,&#13;
the commercial banks want to exploit the ways that information technology can improve both the&#13;
internal management and operational activities as well as the products and services that can be&#13;
made available to customers.&#13;
3.           In order to identify these specific opportunities for realizing significant benefit&#13;
from IT, detailed "Improvement Specification and Scoping Studies" are required for each of the&#13;
six commercial banks participating in the project. These studies are expected to provide a&#13;
blueprint for the time phased implementation of selected initiatives designed to exploit the most&#13;
significant opportunities over a five year time period. Terms of Reference (TORs) for conducting&#13;
the Improvement Specification and Scoping Studies for each of the six participating commercial&#13;
banks are to be developed as a matter of urgency. The purpose of this document is to provide an&#13;
outline description of the objectives and scope of the Improvement Specification and Scoping&#13;
Studies as well as the TORs for an initial short Study Definition Mission to develop and agree&#13;
the TORs for the detailed studies.&#13;
Objectives of the Improvement Specification and Scoping Studies&#13;
4.           The primary objectives of the Improvement Specification and Scoping Studies is&#13;
to provide each participating bank with a soundly based description of the way in which IT can&#13;
be used, during the next three to five years, to support its transformation into a modern&#13;
commercial bank. These IT strategies should be consistent with the current and future business&#13;
plans of the bank and therefore should identify how the cost effective use of IT can address the&#13;
major business problems or opportunities that exist. In this regard, careful emphasis should be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58                                 Annex 2&#13;
placed on the already identified needs to improve management infonnation and executive&#13;
decision support mechanisms as well as computer based enhancements in areas such as customer&#13;
accounting, credit management, financial management, asset/liability management and risk&#13;
control. Particular attention should be given to the progressive centralization of customer&#13;
accounts and their integration with the already planned enhancements in the inter and intra-bank&#13;
payment system arrangements. The study outcomes should also include cost justified and time&#13;
phased implementation programs and technology acquisition strategies.&#13;
Study Definition Mission&#13;
5.            As mentioned at the outset, a short Study Definition Mission will be undertaken&#13;
to develop and agree the TORs for the detailed studies. Although there is likely to be much&#13;
commonality in the resulting TORs for each bank, the mission should recognize that custom&#13;
tailored TORs may be required. Based on the content of the resulting TORs and the views of the&#13;
participating banks, the mission should discuss the advantages and disadvantages of differing&#13;
execution strategies. For example, is there a need for six separate studies; one for each&#13;
participating bank, or is there advantage in combining or partially combining the work of the&#13;
detailed studies? The mission should develop a clear recommendation in this regard.&#13;
6.            The six participating banks are: (a) Agribank; (b) BIDV; (c) Eximbank; (d)&#13;
Incombank; (e) Maritimebank; and (f) Vietcombank.&#13;
7.            Specific issues to be addressed during the study definition mission, for each&#13;
bank, will include: (a) What key business and banking activities will be required to satisfy future&#13;
needs? (b) Which of these activities can benefit from an enhanced use of IT? (c) What IT&#13;
investments have already been made or are planned? (d) What benefits are being sought? (e)&#13;
What do the business priorities dictate in terms of IT development or acquisition? (f) What&#13;
application systems, hardware and networks are currently installed, can be modified or can be&#13;
developed? (g) What is an achievable level of (change) ambition during a three to five year&#13;
period? (h) What should be included in the scope of the detailed studies? (i) What preparation&#13;
work should be done prior to the commencement of the detailed studies? (j) How should the&#13;
studies be implemented? (k) What resources, human and financial, will be required to undertake&#13;
the studies?&#13;
8.            Based on the information generated from the above, the mission should produce&#13;
appropriately detailed Terms of Reference for each bank. These Terms of Reference should&#13;
define the specific objectives of each study, the approach to be adopted and the expected&#13;
outcomes. In addition, the Terms of Reference should clearly define the following:&#13;
* Project scope, structure and timing;&#13;
* Role of external consultants and commercial bank personnel;&#13;
* Guiding principles (For example; participative and designed to gain management&#13;
and user commitment at defined organizational levels);&#13;
* Definition of primary activities and key deliverables (For example, a statement&#13;
of user requirement specifications for the progressive centralization of customer&#13;
accounts for inclusion in a subsequent Bidding Document);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59                               Annex 2&#13;
* Estimate of required resources both internal and external expressed in weeks of&#13;
effort; and&#13;
*  An assessment of the primary sources of benefits.&#13;
As mentioned in paragraph 5, the mission should also make a clear recommendation as to the&#13;
opportunities for combining the six studies or parts of these studies.&#13;
Study Definition Mission - Required Resource and Timing&#13;
9.           The mission should make maximum use of the material that was generated&#13;
during the recently completed.user specification phase of the payments system modernization&#13;
project. In particular, use should be made of the 'Improvement Project Proposal(s)' that were&#13;
prepared by each of the six banks plus the associated meeting notes. These proposals broadly&#13;
covered the following topics:&#13;
Section A:          Introduction and Summary&#13;
Section B:          Description of the Present Arrangements&#13;
Section C:          Improvement Needs and Sought After Benefits&#13;
Section D:          Implementation Strategy&#13;
Section E:          Implementation Management Plan&#13;
Section F:          Anticipated Costs / Benefits and Sources of Funding&#13;
Section G:          Other Information (As Appropriate)&#13;
10.          These documents will be updated by each participating bank and should be made&#13;
available through the Project Management Unit (PMU) within the State Bank of Viet Nam. The&#13;
PMU has been established recently and is responsible for coordinating all work related to the&#13;
improvement initiatives. In particular, the PMU will be responsible for making meeting&#13;
arrangements and providing interpreters to support the work of the consultants during the&#13;
mission.&#13;
II.          The mission should plan on spending 15 days to complete the field work and an&#13;
additional 8 days to prepare the mission deliverables. Mission support will be provided by two&#13;
suitably experienced consultants; a commercial banking consultant and a banking oriented&#13;
computing and telecommunications consultant. Most of the work will be undertaken in Hanoi.&#13;
However, it will be necessary to visit Ho Chi Minh City and Hai Phong to meet with&#13;
representatives of Eximbank and Maritimebank respectively.&#13;
&#13;

Commercial Bank&#13;
1.           The Viet Nam Bank ....... seeks the service of an international public accounting&#13;
firm to audit the financial statements of the Viet Nam Bank . for the fiscal years ending&#13;
December 31, 1994 and 1995. In addition, the selected firm will also (i) prepare a special&#13;
diagnostic report; and (ii) prepare a comprehensive Management Letter summarizing the process&#13;
of the audit and specifically commenting on the issues or concerns raised during the examination&#13;
of the financial statements and the preparation of the diagnostic study.&#13;
2.            The audit and diagnostic review will be performed in accordance with generally&#13;
accepted auditing standards, will consider all relevant International Accounting Standards and&#13;
International Standards of Audit, and will comply with the recommendations of the International&#13;
Federation of Accountants. In instances where national standards, laws or regulations preclude&#13;
the use of such standards, and the effect is judged to be material by the auditors, adequate&#13;
footnote disclosure should be made, including the impact of such departure on the financial&#13;
statements.&#13;
3.            Where a bidding international accounting firm chooses to joint venture with a&#13;
local firm for this engagement, the international firm will be the prime bidder, and the audit&#13;
reports must be signed in the name of the international firm which will be solely responsible for&#13;
carrying out this assignment.&#13;
4.            The financial statements will cover the following:&#13;

(c)    Accounting practices and standards currently in use by the Bank, and how they&#13;
compare with generally accepted practice and standards.&#13;
(d)    Asset quality and the implied risk profile of the Bank. This assessment should&#13;
cover no less than 75% of assets, and should include not only loans but all other&#13;

performing or nonperforming, and risk-classified irrespective of whether they are&#13;
overdue for payment, or whether guarantees and collateral are available. All credit&#13;
to an individual borrower (or to a related group of borrowers) should be placed in the&#13;
same risk classification or different classifications should be specifically noted and&#13;
justified.&#13;
(e)    Credit procedures and practices including consideration of:&#13;

when the related problem assets exceed one-half of one percent of paid-up&#13;
capital and retained earnings.&#13;
(g)    Capital adequacy  giving  consideration  to  risk-weighted  assets and  the&#13;
recommendations of the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision;&#13;

VIET NAM&#13;
PAYMENT SYSTEM AND BANK MODERNIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Draft Terms of Reference for Resident Advisor&#13;
1.            As part of the country s financial sector modernization strategy, the State Bank&#13;
of Viet Nam wishes to improve payment services in the economy in order to reduce float, speed&#13;
up circulation of funds and increase efficiency of funds transmission while providing&#13;
convenience and service to users. For this purpose, a program to improve inter- and intra-bank&#13;
payment services has been designed, with the assistance of external consultants, and the&#13;
technical specifications of the required improvements have been defined. The Government of&#13;
Viet Nam is seeking financial assistance from the International Development Agency to&#13;
implement the new arrangements.&#13;
2.            A description of the project is contained in the Staff Appraisal Report of the&#13;
Payment System and Bank Modernization Project. Background on the financial sector in Viet&#13;
Nam is contained in a report entitled Financial Sector Review. Both reports are attached for your&#13;
information.&#13;
3.            The project is being implemented by the State Bank of Viet Nam  and six&#13;
participating commercial banks. The design, testing, implementation and initial operation of the&#13;
system will be undertaken by a vendor selected through International Competitive Bidding&#13;
procedures in accordance with IDA guidelines. The selected vendor will provide the necessary&#13;
services on a turn-key basis and will operate the system for a period of one year after successful&#13;
implementation in the selected pilot sites. A Project Management Unit (PMU) has been set up at&#13;
the State Bank of Viet Nam to oversee project implementation, coordinate the various project&#13;
activities and beneficiaries, and serve as the contact point for the vendor, IDA and other&#13;
interested entities.&#13;
4.            The State Bank of Viet Nam requires the services of a Resident Technical&#13;
Advisor to advise the PMU on technical, project management and vendor contract matters. The&#13;
successful candidate will serve as a source of independent, technical expertise during the system&#13;
construction and pilot operation phases. He/she will be expected to evaluate the validity and&#13;
usefulness of vendor proposed change orders and system design modifications, and provide&#13;
recommendations on the same to the PMU. He/she will work closely with all beneficiary&#13;
institutions to define desired modifications to the system design and implementation schedule&#13;
contained in the technical specifications, and will assist the PMU in negotiating these with the&#13;
selected vendor.&#13;
5.            He/she will assist the PMU in setting up the appropriate systems for project&#13;
implementation and financial monitoring and reporting. In addition, he/she will act as a resource&#13;
person for technical and project management advice to the commercial banks.&#13;
6.            The Resident Advisor should have a broad understanding of the project&#13;
management aspects of large scale complex software development projects covering: (a)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
79                                Annex 6&#13;
application software design and development; (b) computer hardware and operating system&#13;
software; (c) transport networking; and (d) physical network equipment.&#13;
7.           He/she should have at least fifteen (15) years in the Information System (IS)&#13;
industry. His/her most recent five (5) years of industry experience should have been in a project&#13;
managerial capacity in which he/she managed directly or indirectly at least fifteen (15)&#13;
subordinate staff. In addition, he/she must have specific experience in working with vendors&#13;
employed on a contract basis. He/she should have specific experience gained through the&#13;
management of at least one significant project which involved the development, implementation,&#13;
operation and support of integrated solutions covering multiple sites, a large application system&#13;
software development and its integration with application independent communication network&#13;
services.&#13;
8.           In addition to the above, he/she should demonstrate enthusiasm  about the&#13;
specific opportunity to work on this very important project in Viet Nam.&#13;
&#13;

VIET NAM&#13;
PAYMENT SYSTEM AND BANK MODERNIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Procurement Procedures&#13;
Inter- and Intra-bank Systems&#13;
I .           A turn-key contract for the inter- and intra-bank payment systems improvements&#13;
will be let on the basis of International Competitive Bidding. The Bank's Sample Bidding&#13;
Documents for computer systems will be used. Bids will be evaluated according to a two-stage&#13;
procedure.&#13;
2.            After Bank review and "no-objection" of the finalized bidding documents, and&#13;
after the requisite Bid Invitation Notices and local advertisement, the bidding documents will be&#13;
released to vendors. Vendors will be given 60 days to prepare their Stage I bids. A Bidders'&#13;
Conference will be held during this period to respond to questions and to provide any requested&#13;
clarifications to all interested vendors.&#13;
3.            The Stage I review of the bids will consist of an assessment to identify which&#13;
bids satisfy the specified qualifications criteria. These criteria are both general (standard&#13;
requirements as specified in the sample bidding documents) as well as specific to the project.&#13;
The general criteria include: information on the supplier, the company's financial strength, the&#13;
proposed use of sub-contractors, relevant experience, key personnel, key qualifications to&#13;
develop and implement the project, and other documentation specified in the bidding documents,&#13;
such as performance guarantees. Project-specific qualification criteria include the following:&#13;
(a)    the Bidder must have supplied software development services and relevant&#13;
integration and operation services covering software, hardware and&#13;
communication network equipment for at least five (5) years worldwide, and the&#13;
average annual turnover (total sales) in this regard over the last five (5) years&#13;
must have been in excess of 50 million US dollars worldwide.&#13;
(b)    the working capital for the fiscal year ending in 1994 of the Bidder must have&#13;
been in excess of 8 million US dollars.&#13;
(c)    the Bidder must have successfully implemented at least two (2) contracts&#13;
worldwide for a total value (per project) in excess of 15 million US dollars&#13;
within the last five (5) years for on-line transaction processing systems within&#13;
the banking industry using modern communication network systems, having had&#13;
turn-key management responsibility.&#13;
(d)   the Bidder must have on its current staff, at least one key person in each of the&#13;
following specialist areas involved in the project:&#13;
*  Application software design and development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
81                                 Annex 7&#13;
*  Computer hardware and operating system software&#13;
*  Transport networking&#13;
*  Physical network equipment&#13;
Each key person must meet the following minimum requirements:&#13;
(a)    fifteen (15) years in the Inforrnation System (IS) industry, with the last ten (10)&#13;
years in the particular specialist area.&#13;
(b)   the last seven (7) years of industry experience in a managerial capacity with at&#13;
least fifteen (15) subordinate staff.&#13;
(c)   the overall Project Manager nominated by the Bidder must have at least twenty&#13;
(20) years relevant industry experience, the last ten (10) of which have been in a&#13;
project manager staff over extended periods which involved the development,&#13;
implementation, operation and support of integrated solutions covering multiple&#13;
sites, a large application system software development and its integration with&#13;
application independent communication network services.&#13;
4.            A sufficiently detailed contract compliance evaluation of those bids that meet&#13;
the above qualification criteria will also be undertaken in Stage I to identify those bids that are&#13;
deemed to be substantially compliant with the technical specifications. Deficiencies relating to&#13;
each bid will be identified and documented.&#13;
5.           At the end of Stage 1, a Stage I Evaluation Report will be produced and sent to&#13;
the Bank for review and "no objection". Desired modifications to the requirements will be&#13;
documented in an addendum for issue to Stage 2 bidders during pre-Stage 2 clarification&#13;
meetings. Vendors will be given 3 weeks in which to submit the Stage 2 bids. There will be a&#13;
public opening of Stage 2 bids, with the results being communicated to the Bank.&#13;
6.            The Stage 2 evaluation will consist of two components: a detailed technical&#13;
evaluation wherein each bid is scored for technical merit; and a detailed financial evaluation&#13;
wherein each bid is assessed on "value for money". A Stage 2 Evaluation Report will be&#13;
prepared, combining the results of both the above analyses, and providing a recommendation for&#13;
the bid award. Following the Bank's review and "no objection", the successful vendor will be&#13;
invited to negotiate a contract.&#13;
7.           Further details on the evaluation process, including the technical merit&#13;
weightings and detailed evaluation procedure and methodology, are contained in the Project&#13;
Management Plan.&#13;
Commercial Bank Diagnostic Reviews of Modernization Needs&#13;
8.           Terms of reference for each of the six diagnostic reviews (one for each&#13;
participating commercial bank) will be prepared by consultants hired through the PHRD grant&#13;
according to the requirements laid out in Annex 2. The resulting terms of reference and scope of&#13;
work will be finalized by each commercial bank concerned, and communicated to the Bank for&#13;
review and "no objection". Consultants to undertake these studies will be hired on the basis of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
82                                 Annex 7&#13;
the Bank's guidelines: a Letter of Invitation will be sent to a short-list of consulting firms,&#13;
inviting proposals in regard to the terms of reference, and setting out the criteria against which&#13;
the proposals will be evaluated. Once the proposals are received, they will be evaluated in&#13;
accordance with these criteria, and an Evaluation Report, together with recommendations on the&#13;
award, will be sent to the Bank for review and "no objection", following which the commercial&#13;
bank concerned will sign a contract with the winning firm.&#13;
Commercial Bank Audits&#13;
9.            Terms of reference for the portfolio reviews and audits will be finalized by each&#13;
of the four banks involved on the basis of the draft contained in Annex 3. The procurement&#13;
procedures will be as for the Diagnostic Reviews. However, the procurement procedures of the&#13;
Government of the Netherlands will apply if it provides bilateral funding for these audits.&#13;
Project Management Support&#13;
10.          Miscellaneous equipment for the Project Management Unit (PMU) consists of&#13;
three vehicles, office furniture and three computers and related peripherals, for a total value of&#13;
US$ 110,000 equivalent including all contingencies. All items will be procured through&#13;
International or Local Shopping on the basis of at least three quotations. After sales service and&#13;
availability of spare parts and maintenance will be important criteria in the selection of the&#13;
vendors for the vehicles and for the computer equipment.&#13;
11.          Terms of reference for consulting support for the procurement phase should&#13;
include the following:&#13;
Finalize Bidding Documents (to be undertaken by PMU/NPC/CBs): Finalizing of draft&#13;
bidding documents, in particular the post qualification requirements, the methodology to be&#13;
adopted for the- two-stage bid evaluation, and the interfacing of technical requirement&#13;
specifications with the general terms and conditions of the contract as described in the model&#13;
World Bank document describing the Two-Stage Bidding process for procuring complex&#13;
computer based systems and related services.&#13;
Prepare for and Conduct Bidders Conference: The NPC has an interest in ensuring that each&#13;
potential bidder has a clear understanding of all aspects of the procurement process in regard to&#13;
both content and procedure. In addition, potential bidders are likely to submit questions,&#13;
especially technical ones, about the content of the bidding document. Consultant support for&#13;
these activities is required to support the PMU in preparing for and conducting a bidders&#13;
conference. This will include the analysis of bidders questions and the preparation of appropriate&#13;
answers. Answers will be formally given to potential bidders during a bidders conference in&#13;
Hanoi. In addition, the bidders conference should be used as an opportunity to provide vendors&#13;
with up to date information, if appropriate.&#13;
Stage 1 Support: The following consultant support is required: (a) support to the PMU / Bid&#13;
Evaluation Organization in their review of the Stage 1 technical proposals. This review will&#13;
consist of two components: (i) a preliminary assessment to identify those bids that satisfy the&#13;
mandatory pre-qualification requirements; and (ii) a sufficiently detailed evaluation of qualified&#13;
bids to identify those that are deemed to be substantially compliant with the specifications and&#13;
post qualification requirements for the first stage evaluation. The supervision and the preparation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
83                                 Annex 7&#13;
of formal evaluation reports will include a statement of deficiencies relating to each qualified&#13;
bid. Careful attention should be paid to those bids that are deemed to befQnt substantially&#13;
compliant. In addition, assist in identifying the need for any modifications to the statements of&#13;
technical requirement specifications to bring all substantially compliant bids to a comparable&#13;
technical level. Modifications to the requirements will be documented in a Memorandum for&#13;
issue to qualified bidders during pre Stage 2 clarification meetings; and (b) prepare an&#13;
Addendum to technical specifications, if necessary, to provide all qualifying bidders with a list&#13;
of desired modifications and/or upgrades to the statement of technical requirements&#13;
specifications.&#13;
In undertaking this support, the consultants will be required to read and assess all vendor&#13;
responses. PMU / Bid Organization Structure personnel should also read and analyze all vendor&#13;
responses. The consultants should ensure that the resulting decisions are defensible and agreed&#13;
with appropriate Vietnamese personnel. A Stage I evaluation report should be prepared and&#13;
communicated to the Bank together with the Addendum to Technical Specifications.&#13;
Preparation for Stage 2 Bidding: Following receipt of the World Bank's "No Objection" letter,&#13;
the consultants should support the PMU in conducting clarification meetings with each&#13;
substantially responsive vendor. The objective of these meetings is twofold: (a) to assist that&#13;
vendor address technical deviations as outlined in the Memorandum; and (b) to explain the&#13;
content of the Stage 2 Addendum to ensure that all qualified bidders have an identical&#13;
understanding of the Stage 2 requirements. Following such meetings, assist the PMU in issuing&#13;
the Addendum and inviting Stage 2 bids.&#13;
Stage 2 Support: This stage requires the detailed analysis of the technical content of each&#13;
vendor response. In particular, it requires the assessment of vendor responses to each numbered&#13;
requirement and sub-requirement referenced in the bidding document and the allocation of an&#13;
appropriate weighted points score. The consultants will act in an advisory capacity to the&#13;
Vietnamese evaluation teams. In addition, they will undertake detailed evaluations of each Stage&#13;
2 bid and facilitate the development of a final ranking of bids through comparison of consultant&#13;
and Vietnamese team results. Consultant input will vary with the actual number of vendor&#13;
responses to be evaluated.&#13;
Following Stage 2 bid openings, the consultants will: support the PMU / Bid Evaluation&#13;
Organization in their review of the final technical and commercial proposals to ensure that the&#13;
reviews are conducted in accordance with the methodology specified in the bidding documents;&#13;
and supervise the preparation of draft evaluation reports, which will include a detailed statement&#13;
of deficiencies relating to each qualified bid, and a ranking of bidders on the basis of the&#13;
combined technical and price scores.&#13;
The consultants will be required to undertake detailed evaluations of each bid and facilitate a&#13;
consensus prior to the preparation of the draft evaluation report package.&#13;
12.          As an integral part of the previous step, assist the appropriate decision making&#13;
organization (NPC, etc.) to both understand the outcomes of the evaluation process and prepare&#13;
final versions of the evaluation reports for submission to the World Bank.&#13;
Contract Negotiation Support : Following receipt of the World bank's "No Objection" letter;&#13;
support the PMU and other appropriate participants in preparing for and conducting the formal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
84                                  Annex 7&#13;
contract negotiations with the winning vendor(s). Care should be taken to identify and protect the&#13;
owner from scope, schedule and cost risks.&#13;
13.           The above activities will require some 34 staff weeks of consultant support. In&#13;
the interest of maintaining continuity of the technical approach, and in order to best assess the&#13;
responsiveness of the various bids, the design consultants responsible for producing the technical&#13;
specifications will be hired to provide the above support during the procurement phase. A draft&#13;
contract, together with the finalized terms of reference , will be sent to the Bank for review and&#13;
"no objection".&#13;
14.           The Resident Advisor will be an individual appointment. Here, the key factor&#13;
for success is not only the technical competence and experience of the individual, but, equally&#13;
importantly, his/her inter-personal skills and ability to assimilate and adapt to the situation as&#13;
exists in Viet Nam. Thus, a variety of sources will be tapped to obtain the names of suitable&#13;
individuals, including word of mouth and the professional network. Given the lack of experience&#13;
in this area on the part of the PMU, the Bank may be asked to assist in identifying suitable&#13;
individuals.&#13;

PAYMENT SYSTEM AND BANK MODERNIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Profiles of Participating Commercial Banks&#13;
A. Viet Nam Bank for Agriculture (Agribank)&#13;
Introduction&#13;
I.           Background. The Viet Nam Bank for Agriculture (Agribank) is the dominant rural&#13;
credit institution in Viet Nam. It was separated from the Rural Credit Department of the SBV on&#13;
November 14, 1990, pursuant to Decree No. 400/CT by the Prime Minister. The Charter for Agribank&#13;
was enacted on November II, 1992.&#13;
2.           Business Activity. While Agribank has traditionally performed the role of a rural&#13;
financial institution, it currently provides a wide range of banking services. Agribank has the authority&#13;
to operate in the areas of fund mobilization, trust operations, lending, international banking, leasing,&#13;
precious metals and gem dealing, and a number of other areas, including participation in joint-ventures&#13;
with foreign financial institutions. Agribank lends to some 2,500 SOEs and 40 stock companies, as well&#13;
as to more than 10 million production households. Agribank is also the executing agent for trust services&#13;
for a variety of international bilateral aid organizations and NGOs. Agribank recently provided US$4&#13;
million from the ADB to develop the sugar industry, and another US$23 from the ADB to improve the&#13;
dairy sector. It is also expected to extend credit to poorer individuals and poorer provinces and to the&#13;
victims of natural disasters.&#13;
3.           Agribank plays a critical role as the provider of rural finance, given its extensive rural&#13;
branch banking system. It acts primarily as a direct lender, but also lends indirectly through cooperatives&#13;
and rural shareholding banks. Agribank is developing greater operational efficiency and outreach&#13;
through rationalizing its rural network and by engaging in innovative rural lending practices. Agribank&#13;
has begun to experiment with extending banking services to rural areas by establishing subdistrict&#13;
transactions offices and by forming mobile banking teams that make frequent village visits.&#13;
4.           Agribank has established specialized branches active in the silk and rubber industries. It&#13;
has also established four subsidiaries active in leasing, precious metals and gems, brokering, and&#13;
investment consulting. Agribank also owns a 50% stake in Vinasian Bank, a joint-stock bank it began&#13;
with the Siam Commercial Bank of Thailand. Agribank is actively exploring other investment&#13;
opportunities, a recent example being its discussions with Smith New Court to establish an investment&#13;
company.&#13;
5.           Agribank's loan portfolio is dominated by short-term loans, but Agribank has shifted its&#13;
lending focus away from SOEs and towards financing rural households and small businesses. This&#13;
reorientation is apparent from the growth in new loan volume to those private borrowers from about D&#13;
355 billion in outstanding loans at the end of 1991 to about D 4,630 billion. By comparison, loans to&#13;
SOEs barely increased, rising from D 2,219 billion in 1991 to D 2,409 billion in 1994.&#13;
6.           Rough estimates of the distribution of credit through Agribank indicate that new loan&#13;
funds were distributed broadly. Outstanding loans at the end of 1994 had the following breakdown:&#13;
agriculture 53%, forestry 16%, aquaculture 20%, and other sectors 11%.  Alternatively, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
88                                   Annex 10&#13;
categorization of loans by Agribank suggests that the proportion of production and farm input supply&#13;
loans was 25% in 1991 and 23% in 1992. Food marketing loans also reportedly declined from 31% in&#13;
1991 to 25% in 1992. Given recent changes in how Agribank reports loans by use, and the potential for&#13;
misinterpretation, no clear pattern of loan distribution can be discerned. There is some variation in the&#13;
interest rates for short-term rates, but there is no apparent variation in regards medium-term loans.&#13;
7.           Foreign Assistance. To enhance its operations and further its development, Agribank&#13;
has received support from the World Bank, International Development Agency, training and technical&#13;
assistance funded by the Swedish and French governments, as well as assistance from domestic and&#13;
foreign information and telecommunications institutions. It has recently received SDR 69.4 million as&#13;
part of the Agriculture Rehabilitation Credit from IDA, an US$80 million loan from ADB and DM 7&#13;
million for a project in the central provinces.&#13;
Institutional Aspects&#13;
8.            Branch Network. Agribank is headquartered in Hanoi and has an extensive nationwide&#13;
branch network. It has a southern representative office in Ho Chi Minh City and a central representative&#13;
office in Quy Nhon City, five regional branches, 53 provincial and city branches, and 416 district&#13;
branches. In addition, there are nearly 2,400 transaction offices at entities such as agencies, shops and&#13;
savings desks mobilizing funds for Agribank. Agribank is aiming to increase its branch network in rural&#13;
areas, where it sees significant opportunities to increase its funds mobilization capabilities. This&#13;
expansion strategy focuses on increasing Agribank's transaction office network, which serves Viet&#13;
Nam's 7,000 villages. Agribank would eventually like to have one transaction office in operation for&#13;
every one or two villages in the country.&#13;
9.            Strategy and Planning. With the assistance of outside donors, Agribank is in the process&#13;
of developing a comprehensive institutional development plan. This plan constitutes the heart of&#13;
Agribank's strategy to transform itself into a genuine commercial bank that is capable of satisfying the&#13;
banking needs of the agricultural and industrial sectors, fully competitive in the region, and integrated&#13;
into the international community. This plan will be fully implemented by the year 2000 and proposes&#13;
that Agribank: (i) perform an external audit; (ii) increase equity capital to US$300 million; (iii) delineate&#13;
precise job qualifications at headquarters and branch levels; (iv) prepare a comprehensive training&#13;
program based on an accurate staffing plan; (v) improve credit processes and procedures; and (vi)&#13;
develop a computerized management information system.  Regarding progress on the plan's&#13;
implementation, Agribank is currently undergoing an external audit, and it has retained outside expertise&#13;
in management information systems and human resources development.&#13;
10.          The Board of Management prepares an annual business plan, which is then approved by&#13;
the Board of Directors. This business plan covers a broad range of activities and specifies details on&#13;
extending credit, mobilizing funds, using funds, and estimating revenues, expenditures, and taxes. The&#13;
primary objective of the plan is to balance the projected sources and uses of funds. It also details plans&#13;
concerning human resources development, training and technology improvement.&#13;
11.          Organizational Structure. Agribank is governed by a Board of Directors, who are&#13;
appointed with the approval of the SBV. The Board chooses Agribank's senior management, including&#13;
the Director General, who must also be approved by the SBV. The Director General is the senior&#13;
executive officer of the bank. He has general oversight of all of Agribank's major divisions: the General&#13;
Inspection Department, the General Director's Office, Domestic and Overseas Representative Offices,&#13;
Business Strategy Section, Business Techniques Section, Financial Management Section, Logistics&#13;
Section, Non-banking Companies, Universal Banking Regional Branches, and Specialized Operations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
89                                   Annex 10&#13;
Branches. The senior management of Agribank is represented by the Board of Management, which&#13;
compmses the General Director and six Deputy General Directors.&#13;
12.          Staffing and Training. As of June 30, 1994, Agribank had 20,728 employees, 330 of&#13;
whom worked at the headquarters office. Since 1994, Agribank has adopted a recruitment criteria&#13;
focusing on qualified college graduates knowledgeable in foreign languages and informatics. A recent&#13;
breakdown of staff educational levels is as follows: 17 post-graduates (&lt;1%), 5,456 graduates (26%),&#13;
11,363 high school graduates (54%), and 2,729 vocational graduates (13%). In order to retain qualified&#13;
staff in an environment in which the MOF establishes a common base salary for SOCBs, Agribank has&#13;
introduced a performance based compensation system that allows top performers to qualify for bonuses&#13;
of up to three times their base salaries. Agribank also stresses job security in its efforts to compete with&#13;
the higher salaries paid by private sector financial institutions. It also gives grants to promising&#13;
university students with the intention that they will join Agribank upon graduation. Agribank is not&#13;
cuffeRtly expanding its staffing levels, and is hiring personnel only to replace retirees.&#13;
13.          During 1995, Agribank expects to have 6,000 attend training of some kind. Most of&#13;
these staff will receive training at one of Agribank's five training centers. This training will primarily&#13;
comprise project design, appraisal, and evaluation; international banking operations; informnation&#13;
technology; and foreign languages. In addition, 200 Agribank staff will receive external training, much&#13;
of it funded by the Bank and ADB.&#13;
Operations&#13;
14.          Credit Polic. Agribank has established policies for granting short-term loans, and is&#13;
currently preparing guidelines for medium- and long-tern loans, with the assistance of ADB. When&#13;
making a loan, Agribank analyzes both the technical and financial viability of the proposed activity.&#13;
While Agribank has the authority to lend up to 50% of borrower assets and 100% of expected income, in&#13;
practice, it limits short-term loans to 70% of the proposed investment and 50% of medium-term&#13;
investments due to credit rationing. Credit officers at the village level have the authority to make loans&#13;
of up to D 20 million, those at the provincial level can makes loans of up to D 20 billion, and those at the&#13;
provincial level have a limit of D 100 billion. Loans exceeding D 100 billion are reviewed by a credit&#13;
committee at the central level and require the approval of the General Director. However, these limits&#13;
are not always strictly adhered to. Smaller sized loans have a simplified approval process which is&#13;
decided by a joint liability group. Larger loans require collateralization and are subject to much greater&#13;
scrutiny zmd analysis. The credit officer is responsible for tracking a portfolio of loans and Agribank has&#13;
a number of remedial measures for dealing with poorly performing loans. As part of the external audit&#13;
which Agribank is currently undergoing, a thorough review is being conducted on its loan portfolio.&#13;
15.          The flow of credit remains subject to the vestiges of a planned credit allocation scheme,&#13;
as Agribank channels funds to particular agricultural subsectors and geographical areas. Based on the&#13;
annual availability of funds, Agribank's provincial directors determine the allocation of lending funds&#13;
across their banking districts. It is believed that the factors affecting such decisions include the existence&#13;
of designated economic enterprises zones, priority borrower populations such as ethnic minorities, and&#13;
district loan collection performance. Agribank onlends at rates derived from the reference rates set by&#13;
the SBV. In principle, Agribank has latitude to adjust rates based on variations in operating costs and&#13;
credit risks.&#13;
16.          Resource Mobilization. Agribank views its rural expansion program as an important&#13;
tool for resource mobilization as it hopes to attract individual savings. Interest rates paid by Agribank on&#13;
demand and savings deposits generally follow SBV guidelines. However, Agribank has become&#13;
increasingly dependent on project-linked "deposit substitutes" offering higher rates in a bid to attract&#13;
&#13;

savings. These substitute funding arrangements take various forms, including bonds and promissory&#13;
notes. Agribank increased its dependence on deposit substitutes from 0.1% of total nonequity funds at&#13;
the end of 1991, to 4.7% at the end of 1992, and to 19% at end of September 1994, representing 41% of&#13;
total deposit substitutes of all the deposit-taking banks in Viet Nam. Agribank recently began marketing&#13;
bonds at 19.5% to mobilize small savers, which it views as a stable source of finance. Agribank is also&#13;
interested in raising capital in foreign markets.&#13;
17.           Auditing. For internal audit purposes, Agribank has a General Inspection Department&#13;
that operates on the district and provincial level. There are typically one supervisor at the district level&#13;
and six to seven at the provincial level. These personnel produce monthly and quarterly reports for bank&#13;
management. The internal auditing system is currently being converted to a computerized operation.&#13;
Regarding external auditing, Agribank is currently undergoing an extensive audit by an Australian&#13;
accounting firm. The final audit report is being finalized and should be available by June-July 1995. In&#13;
addition, SBV and MOF perform supervisory audits of Agribank activities.&#13;
Financial Structure and Performance&#13;
18.           Structure. For the period 1990 to 1994, the total assets of Agribank increased 306.9%, rising from&#13;
D 2,627.7 billion to D 10,691.8 billion, averaging an annual growth rate of 42.3%. During the same period, total&#13;
liabilities grew 291.4%, rising from D 2,522.5 billion to D 9,872.8 billion. By comparison, total equity grew much&#13;
faster, rising from D 105.4 billion to D 819.0 billion, or 677.1%. Despite this dramatic rise in equity, the proportion&#13;
of equity in Agribank's capital structure remains small; in 1994, the debt to equity ratio was 92:8.&#13;
19.           Lending by Agribank has increased rapidly, rising from D 1,551.8 billion in 1990 to D&#13;
7,023.2 billion in 1994, an increase of 352.6%. Deposit growth has been much slower, rising from D&#13;
1,104 billion in 1990 to D 2,485.2 billion in 1994, an increase of 125.1%. Consequently, the loans to&#13;
deposit ratio for Agribank rose from 140.6% in 1990 to 282.6% in 1994.&#13;
20.           Profitability. Agribank has returned to profitability after losing D 80.6 billion in 1991&#13;
and D 42.8 billion in 1992. Agribank reported net income of D 6.0 billion in 1993 and D 12.7 billion in&#13;
1994. Agribank generates almost all of its revenues from interest income, which accounted for nearly&#13;
99% of total revenue in 1994. Earnings have been pressured since total expenses have been increasing&#13;
faster than total income. Interest income increased by 1,070.6% from D 199.8 billion in 1990 to D&#13;
2,338.8 billion in 1994; by comparison, interest expenses increased by 1,748.8% from D 90.5 billion to&#13;
D 1,673.1 billion. However, while the ratio of interest expenses to interest income stood at 84.5% in&#13;
1991, it has been declining steadily, and was 71.5% in 1994. Non-interest expenses have also been&#13;
contributing to poor profitability. While salaries as a percentage of total assets had been declining for a&#13;
number of years, they rose in 1994, reaching 3.7% of average assets. In 1994, net income measured in&#13;
terms of average assets was just 0.1%, and it was likewise small when measured in terms of average&#13;
equity, at 1.9%. Agribank is subject to a 2% tax on financial margin, a 45% profit tax on net income,&#13;
and a 6% tax on capital use. As with other SOCBs, there are few incentives to maximize profit, since the&#13;
disposition of surplus is regulated by the state.&#13;

Notes: These projections were prepared based on data supplied by Agribank. Agribank data were adjusted to reflect price increases as follows:&#13;
1995 (7%), 1996-98 (6%), 1999-00 (5%). Interest expenses include expected costs associated with the proposed IDA credit assessed as&#13;
follows: 1995 (D 0.007 bil), 1996, (D 1.452 bil) 1997 (D 3.877 bil), 1998 (D 6.375 bil), 1999 (D 7.328 bil) and 2000 (D 7.289 bil), and so&#13;
represent a relatively small portion of total interest expenses. These numbers were converted to from Dong to USS based on an exchange rate&#13;
of D 11,200 = USSI.&#13;

B. Bank for Investment and Development of Viet Nam (BIDV)&#13;
Introduction&#13;
21.          Background. The Bank for Investment and Development of Viet Nam (BIDV) currently&#13;
operates as an SOCB. From the period 1957 to 1987, it functioned under the Ministry of Finance as the&#13;
Bank for Reconstruction and allocated funds from the state budget to promote the assembly and&#13;
construction sectors. From 1987 to 1990, it was known as the Bank for Investment and Construction of&#13;
Viet Nam and was administered by the SBV. During this period, it allocated funds from the state budget,&#13;
provided working capital to the assembly and construction sectors, and provided preferential loans for&#13;
investment and development. It has been known by its current name ever since November 1990.&#13;
22.           Business Actiyity. BIDV is the sole bank in Viet Nam specializing investment and&#13;
development. It also conducts a number of other banking activities, including offering term credit to&#13;
enterprises for development, granting working capital loans to assembly enterprises, providing domestic&#13;
and international settlement, acting as an agent for trust lending, and mobilizing long-tern funds from&#13;
both domestic and international sources. Since the beginning of 1995, BIDV has begun a number of new&#13;
activities, including mobilizing short-term funds and offering loans to economic sectors of the economy,&#13;
as well as a host of other commercial banking activities. Until December 1994, BIDV had also allocated&#13;
funds from the state budget for development purposes, but this activity has been turned over to the MOF.&#13;
23.          BIDV plays an important developmental role in the Vietnamese economy. It is a&#13;
significant source of term financing, and 70% of its loans are medium- and long-term. These loans are&#13;
mainly used to finance construction and materials supply. BIDV has recently begun to offer export&#13;
finance credit, which grew from nothing in 1993 to US$150 million in 1994. It views this activity as&#13;
vital to the country's development, given the need to import high-value capital goods. It has also&#13;
handled bilateral funding from France, Gernany and Japan. BIDV currently has 525,000 customers and&#13;
654,000 accounts.&#13;
24.          BIDV is actively pursuing investment opportunities. It has a 50% stake in VID Public&#13;
Bank which it set up with a Malaysian bank. It also has a 10% share in housing banks in Hanoi and Ho&#13;
Chi Minh City. BIDV is also currently seeking approval from the GOV to establish two joint-venture&#13;
leasing companies, one with a Japanese partner and the other with a Korean partner. BIDV would have a&#13;
50% share in these enterprises and would have to put up US$5 million in capital for each one. BIDV&#13;
also recently received approval to establish a leasing company and an investment company for building&#13;
houses. As the privatization process proceeds in Viet Nam, BIDV has expressed its interest in&#13;
purchasing the shares of newly privatized companies. It would also like to begin investment banking&#13;
operations once a stock market is in full operation.&#13;
Institutional Aspects&#13;
25.          Branch Network. BIDV has a nationwide branch network and an active presence in all&#13;
of the country's provinces. It has a headquarters and transaction office in Hanoi and a representative&#13;
office in Ho Chi Minh City, where it is also planning to open another transaction office. In addition,&#13;
BIDV has 54 provincial branches, and five transaction offices and 40 sub-branches at the district level.&#13;
There are 18 departments at headquarters. The five largest branches have eight to ten departments each,&#13;
while the smaller ones have four. BIDV is currently upgrading the services in its sub-branches and&#13;
transaction offices so that they can offer more banking services. It sees the primary function of its&#13;
branch network as funds mobilization.  BIDV has established over 100 correspondent banking&#13;
relationships.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
95                                   Annex 10&#13;
26.           Strategy and Planning. BIDV's primary strategic objective is to diversify its activities,&#13;
particularly with regard to capital sources. Previously, BIDV was limited to providing funds for SOEs,&#13;
but its client base and product range have grown substantially. BIDV produces an annual plan with&#13;
detailed targets covering a range of areas, including funds mobilization, loans outstanding, profit, and&#13;
wages. When devising these targets and objectives, planners carefully examine BIDV's financial&#13;
operations, capital structure, and recent performance.&#13;
27.           Organizational Structure. The highest body at BIDV is the Board of Govemors. The&#13;
Board of Govemors chooses the Board of Management, which comprises the bank's senior managers.&#13;
There are many functional departments in the bank, including intemational banking, intemational&#13;
settlement, risk information and prevention, appraisal-consultancy, guarantee-services, credit,&#13;
communication-propaganda, capital and resources-marketing, financing and accounting, informatics,&#13;
personnel, wages and emulation, human resources development, legislative, and administration.&#13;
28.           Staffing and Training. BIDV currently has 3,135 staff and will increase to 3,200 in&#13;
1995. BIDV has indicated that it faces serious shortfalls of experienced people, and has asked many of&#13;
its directors to stay on since many are due to retire this year. BIDV recruits new staff who are college&#13;
graduates, proficient in English, and computer literate. At the end of 1994, the educational breakdown of&#13;
BIDV's work force was as follows: post graduate (&lt;1%), university graduate (45%), secondary&#13;
education (36%), and elementary education (10%).&#13;
29.           About 90% of staff at BIDV work with computers, but their technical expertise and job&#13;
requirements vary considerably. Consequently, BIDV has designed its computer training program along&#13;
the following lines: (i) intensive training for experienced users; (ii) training to allow application users to&#13;
better understand applications programming; and (iii) specialized training in database management and&#13;
systems analysis. This program would be accomplished by administering spot training; by attendance at&#13;
one of the three training centers located in the northem, central, and southem regions of the country; or&#13;
by longer-term informatics training for software engineers either domestically or intemationally.&#13;
Operations&#13;
30.          Credit. BIDV offers short-, medium-, and long-term credit, and so is flexible in meeting&#13;
the banking needs of a particular project or borrower. When determining credit allocation, BIDV&#13;
considers the ability of the borrower to repay the loan and the amount of time it will take to receive this&#13;
repayment. Priority is acorded those projects which expand existing production and which promote&#13;
exports. BIDV has a number of policies to protect against credit risk. BIDV requires collateral from&#13;
non-SOEs up to 60% of the value of the credit. For SOEs, BIDV looks closely at the capital structure of&#13;
the SOE and at the contract between the SOE and its counterparty. For long-term loans to SOEs, BIDV&#13;
requires the borrower to pledge the property to be financed and, in some cases, may require a guarantee&#13;
from the line ministry. For traditional borrowers, BIDV does not require deposits, but deposits may be&#13;
required from  new customers if conditions warrant.  Credit authority rests with different levels&#13;
depending on the size and term of the loan. Branch directors may approve short-term loans of up to D 5&#13;
billion per borrower; however, the head office must approve larger short-term loans, and for all medium-&#13;
and long-term loans. BIDV has a single borrower limit equivalent to 10% of legal capital.&#13;
31.           BIDV reports that is having little trouble with the quality of its loan portfolio and further&#13;
report that, for some years, it did not register any overdue payments. It attributes this success to a&#13;
number of factors: lending has concentrated on financing equipment rather than on trading, which is less&#13;
risky policy since physical goods can be used as collateral and auctioned off; good relationships with its&#13;
borrowers, which helps in the determination of credit worthiness; a deep understanding of the customer,&#13;
which aids in appraisal; a centralized approval system, which ensures consistency; and a comprehensive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
96                                  Annex 10&#13;
monitoring process, which covers the entire length of the repayments period. BIDV believes that its&#13;
monitoring capabilities would be further enhanced with the implementation of a centralized payments&#13;
system, which the proposed Bank project would support. BIDV assumed US$3.5 million in bad loans&#13;
upon the dismantling of the monobank system. These loans have been frozen and are no longer&#13;
classified as loans on the balance sheet. They are accounted for in the "Other Assets" line item with an&#13;
offsetting entry in "Borrowings from SBV".&#13;
32.          Audifing. BIDV's Annual Report is audited by he SBV. In 1994, BIDV hired a&#13;
Vietnamese accounting firm, VACO, to audit its branches in Ho Chi Minh City and Binh Dinh. BIDV&#13;
recognizes the need to undergo an external audit but, like the other SOCBs, it does not believe that local&#13;
auditing capabilities have sufficiently developed to perform such an exercise. In recognition of this fact,&#13;
BIDV has approached the World Bank about identifying the resources to allow an international&#13;
accounting firm to perform a comprehensive audit of BIDV's finances and operations.&#13;
Financial Structure and Performance&#13;
33.          Structure. BIDV's total assets increased from D 1,929.0 billion in 1991 to D 8,662.1&#13;
billion in 1994, representing a 349.0% increase. Total liabilities grew much faster during the same&#13;
period, rising from D 739.6 billion to D 5,247.6 billion, a 609.5% increase. On the other hand, total&#13;
equity increased by only 187.1%, going from D 1,189.4 billion to D 3,414.5 billion. Between 1993 and&#13;
1994, total assets rose by 63.7%, total liabilities by 150.0%, and total equity by 7.1%. Given the rapid&#13;
growth in liabilities, BIDV's capital structure has changed radically and the ratio of debt to equity rose&#13;
from 38:62 in 1991 to 61:39 in 1994.&#13;
34.          Total loans increased from D 1,433.8 billion in 1991 to D 5,298.5 billion in 1994,&#13;
representing an increase of 269.5% By contrast, total deposits are much smaller than total loans, but&#13;
have been going at a faster rate. In 1991, total deposits amounted to D 291.7 billion, and rose to D&#13;
1,230.0 in 1994, a 321.6% increase. Consequently, the loans to deposits ratio for 1994 was 430.8%.&#13;
Between 1993 and 1994, total loans grew by 42.2% and total deposits grew by 22.4%.&#13;
35.          Profitability. BIDV has consistently reported profits. From 1991 to 1994, net income&#13;
increased 146.7%, rising from D 26.9 billion to D 66.3 billion, an annual average rate of 41.0%. From&#13;
1993 to 1994, net income increased by 9.8%. BIDV earns most of its revenues from interest income,&#13;
which accounted for 93.3% of total revenues in 1994. During the period 1991 to 1994, interest income&#13;
rose from D 216.4 billion to D 478.4 billion, and interest expenses from D 138.7 billion to D 223.9&#13;
billion. Lending expenses accounted for two-thirds of all interest expenses in 1994, with borrowing&#13;
expenses making up the balance. The ratio of interest expenses to interest income decreased from 64. 1%&#13;
in 1991 to 46.8% in 1994. Despite these positive developments, other profitability measures have been&#13;
eroding, largely reflecting growth of non-interest expenses. The ratio of net income to average total&#13;
assets was 2.2% in 1992, 1.4% in 1993 and 0.9% in 1994. At the same time, net income to average total&#13;
equity decreased from 3.3% in 1992, to 2.3% in 1993, and to 2.0% in 1994. BIDV is subject to a profit&#13;
tax of 45%, a turnover tax of 15% assessed on interest rate spread, and a capital use tax of 6% assessed&#13;
on capital provided by the GOV.&#13;

were then adjusted upward to reflect price increases as follows: 1995 (7%/6), 1996-98 (6%), 1990-00 (5%). Interest expenses include expected&#13;
costs associated with the proposed IDA credit assessed as follows: 1995 (D 0.228 bil), 1996 (D 2.065 bil), 1997 (D 4.226 bil), 1998 (D 5.622&#13;

C. Viet Nam Export Import Bank (Eximbank)&#13;
Introduction&#13;
36.          Background. The Viet Nam Export Import Bank (Eximbank) is one of the first joint&#13;
stock banks established in the country after the 1988 banking sector reforms. Decision No. 140/CT of&#13;
the Chairman of the Council of Ministers dated May 24, 1989 authorizes the establishment of Eximbank&#13;
with the stated purpose of promoting export development programs and investment for export oriented&#13;
production and processing. Article I of the Decision establishes the bank as a "limited joint stock bank,&#13;
with its own legal status, autonomous accounting and self-determination in monetary and credit business&#13;
and banking services...". Article 2 of the same Decision states that Eximbank is "organized and managed&#13;
in accordance with the Charter adopted by the General Meeting of Shareholders' Delegates and ratified&#13;
by the Director General of the State Bank of Vietnam." Eximbank's Charter was adopted on November&#13;
15, 1989, and ratified on January 17, 1990. Eximbank thus formally began operations as of that date.&#13;
37.          Eximbank has 125,000 outstanding shares. Its shareholding structure is as follows: 68%&#13;
shares held by 191 state-owned enterprises; 24% shares held by 18 private economic organizations; and&#13;
8% shares held by 1,348 individual shareholders. The largest shareholders are the Saigon Jewelery&#13;
Company, an SOE owned by the local People's Committee (12.2%), Generalimex, a general trading&#13;
company in Hanoi owned by the Ministry of Trade (11.0%), Generalexim, a general trading company in&#13;
Ho Chi Minh City owned by the Ministry of Trade (11.0%), Asian Commercial Bank, a joint-stock bank&#13;
in Ho Chi Minh City (8.0%), and Saigon Tourist Company, also in Ho Chi Minh City (1.6%).&#13;
Authorized legal capital at founding was D 100 billion, which was subsequently increased to D 125&#13;
billion by Decision No. 198/QD-NH5 issued by the Governor of the SBV on October 10, 1993. Paid-up&#13;
capital as of December31, 1994 was D 125 billion.&#13;
38.          Business Activty. Eximbank focuses on providing banking services for exporting and&#13;
importing activities. Similar activities are carried out at headquarters and in the three branches. The&#13;
bulk of the bank's business is short-term lending. However, Eximbank recent extended a five-year loan&#13;
for the construction of a new hotel. Eximbank is also involved in foreign exchange trading and export-&#13;
import settlements. Eximbank's client base is primarily trading companies. It has not targeted industrial&#13;
borrowers since its capital base is relatively small. Eximbank maintains extensive correspondent&#13;
banking relationships with 424 foreign bank branches in close to 50 countries. Eximbank has not&#13;
established any subsidiaries and is not active in any joint-ventures. Eximbank counts amongst its&#13;
competitive advantages its good knowledge of the SBV and local Vietnamese banks, as well as of the&#13;
country's development strategy and potential.&#13;
39.          The total value of export reimbursement through Eximbank was US$301 million in&#13;
1993, or 10% of the total turnover of national exports. The total value of settlements for imports was&#13;
US$339 million in 1993, also accounting for 10% of the total turnover of national import settlement. The&#13;
total value of usance L/Cs opened in 1994 was US$300 million.&#13;
Institutional Aspects&#13;
40.          Branch Network. Eximbank is headquartered in Ho Chi Minh City, and has three&#13;
branches: one in Hanoi, inaugurated on November 27, 1992; one in Danang, opened on January 28,&#13;
1994; and the third which recently opened in 1995 in Can Tho. Eximbank's initial strategy was to&#13;
establish a present in major commercial centers involved in foreign trade. Eximbank now expects strong&#13;
banking demand in rural areas, and so is exploring a strategy aimed at expanding its branch network in&#13;
rural areas in the northern and southern regions of the country where it expects significant growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
101                                 Annex 10&#13;
41.          Strategy and Planning.  Eximbank's major business objective is to support export&#13;
development through: (a) financing trade; (b) financing export-oriented production, sub-contracting and&#13;
manufacturing; and (c) taking equity participations in export-oriented ventures. Operational objectives&#13;
are to: (a) mobilize funds in Vietnamese dong and foreign currencies through direct borrowings and&#13;
deposit mobilization; (b) undertake foreign currency operations through trading and transfers from&#13;
overseas Vietnamese; (c) provide international payment services; (d) provide bank guarantees to local&#13;
enterprises for local and foreign borrowing; (e) grant dong and foreign currency loans for export-oriented&#13;
activities; and (f) provide other services related to cash operations, gold imports and consulting advice.&#13;
42.          Management prepares a five year plan which is discussed at the general shareholders'&#13;
meeting. It provides direction and does not contain many quantitative objectives. The current five year&#13;
plan aims to: (a) pursue a policy of rural expansion; (b) diversify operations by offering with new&#13;
activities and products; (c) increase capital to D 500 billion by 1999; (d) increase sources of funds to D&#13;
7,000 billion by 1999; (e) expand the ATM network; and (f) introduce new credit card and Smartcard&#13;
instruments.&#13;
43.          The aims laid out in the five year plan as well as careful analysis of data provided by&#13;
each branch, provide the basis for the preparation of Eximbank's annual business plan. This plan sets out&#13;
very specific financial, operational and institutional targets source of funds, use of funds, export-import&#13;
financing, asset management, criteria for treasury management, organizational development, business&#13;
efficiency, technology development, human resource development.&#13;
44.          Resource Mobilization. Eximbank intends to increase its deposit mobilization efforts to&#13;
meet the increasing needs for loan funds. In addition to offering different deposit products, increasing&#13;
customer confidence in the bank is key to achieving this objective. Eximbank is therefore desirous of&#13;
improving its payment services. Eximbank recently received SFR 24 million as part of a SFR 40 million&#13;
loan by the Swiss govemment to finance exports of Swiss goods into Viet Nam. Eximbank borrowed the&#13;
funds at 1% and can on-lend at a rate of 5% to 6%. In order to expand its activities, Eximbank has asked&#13;
for approval from the SBV to double its capital from the present D125 billion to D250 billion, of which&#13;
30% would be reserved for foreign participants.&#13;
45.          Organization Structure. Eximbank's chief executive body is the General Meeting of&#13;
Shareholders' Delegates, whose members are chosen on the basis of each 250 shares of stock. Under this&#13;
body is a Board of Directors, whose members are elected by the General Meeting every four years and&#13;
who serve a four year terms. The Managing Director General is chosen by the Board of Directors for an&#13;
open ended term, but may be removed six months after his appointment at the discretion of the Board.&#13;
The selection of the Managing Director General and the members of the Board of Directors is subject to&#13;
the approval of the SBV. The Board consists of a Chairman, who is the Director General of the Saigon&#13;
Jewelry Company; two Deputy Chairmen, one from Generalexim; one from Generalimex; and eight&#13;
members drawn from various state enterprises and the People's Committee of Quang Nam in Danang&#13;
Province. Eximbank's two Comptrollers, drawn from Saigon Finance Company and Tenimex report&#13;
directly to the General Meeting of Shareholder's Delegates.&#13;
46.          The Deputy Director General oversees functional departments at headquarters and the&#13;
bank's two branches. Activities at headquarters are organized in seven departments: Intemational&#13;
Relations; Intemational Settlements; Credit and Investment; Cash; Planning and Foreign Exchange;&#13;
General Accounts; and Administration. Both branches have five divisions each: Intemational Relations&#13;
and Settlements; Credit and Investment; Cash; Accounting; and Administration.&#13;
47.          Staffing and Training. Eximbank is growing rapidly and currently employs 250 staff,&#13;
compared to 215 in 1994 and 145 in 1993. Hiring levels depend on workload activity. Eximbank&#13;
recruits college graduates from colleges specializing in economics, banking and foreign languages.&#13;
Recruits undergo a foreign language examination and have a three to six month probation period at the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
102                                    Annex 10&#13;
bank. Bank management reports that it has difficulties retaining qualified staff due to the relatively low&#13;
pay structure imposed by the MOF. Eximbank has attempted to supplement basic salaries with bonuses&#13;
tied to bank profitability and individual performnance, but the compensation package is still below what&#13;
foreign banks can afford to pay. As an example, the average compensation for a new employee at&#13;
Eximbank is D 850,000 per month, while the average package for a new employee at a foreign bank is D&#13;
3,000,000 per month.&#13;
48.           Eximbank wishes to create a well-trained cadre of professional staff. Most of the staff&#13;
are recent college graduates. However, the amount of external training is restricted by resource&#13;
constraints. Training is also achieved through rotational assignments in the bank's branches. Many staff&#13;
also attend classes in foreign languages after regular work hours. Bank managers complain that many&#13;
staff leave the bank once it has committed considerable resources training them, and Eximbank now&#13;
requires compensation for training by the those employees leaving the bank to work elsewhere.&#13;
Eximbank has a five-year staff development and training plan in order to bring the skills of its staff to&#13;
international standards.  Eximbank has availed itself of the training programs offered by various&#13;
bilateral, multilateral and private agencies in Viet Nam, including the Bank-executed, SIDA-financed&#13;
Banking Sector Training Project. Some staff have been sent abroad for month-long training courses in&#13;
foreign banks. Eximbank's correspondent banks send specialists to provide training on specific topics to&#13;
Eximbank staff.&#13;
Operations&#13;
49.           Credit.  Eximbank has standard written credit policies and procedures which are&#13;
available to all credit officers.  Eximbank thoroughly appraises the loan and examines the credit&#13;
worthiness of potential borrowers. It requires collateral, but admits this requirement is somewhat&#13;
problematical when dealing with SOEs. The Hanoi branch has the authority to approve loans under&#13;
US$5 million, and the Da Nang branch has a lower threshold.&#13;
50.           Turnover of "investment" loans and other advances was D3,784 billion in 1993. Annual&#13;
lending tumover for the first II months in 1994 is reported as D828 billion in local currency and US$143&#13;
million in foreign currency. The bulk of this (84%) was in foreign currency. Prescribed lending rates in&#13;
dong are considerably higher than those in dollars, and since the dong/dollar exchange rate has been&#13;
reasonably stable over the past 2-3 years, companies prefer to borrow in dollars.&#13;
51.           Eximbank extends considerable effort to ensure the quality of its loan portfolio. At the&#13;
appraisal stage it conducts a vigorous analysis of the loan and the credit worthiness of the borrower. It&#13;
typically requires collateral. In the case of letters of credit, Eximbank has them drawn up in the name of&#13;
the bank. Loan payments are then constantly monitored and remedial actions are enacted as soon as&#13;
problems arise. As a result, problem loans constitute a relatively low 3% of Eximbank's portfolio.&#13;
52.           Resource Mobilization. Eximbank mobilizes resources both domestically and from&#13;
abroad. Domestic resources include customer deposits in both dong and foreign currency. Total turnover&#13;
of deposits in 1993 was D6,896 billion in local currency and US$2,090 million in foreign currency,&#13;
almost all demand deposits. Eximbank's savings deposit turnover in the same year was D130 billion in&#13;
local currency and US$4.3 million in foreign currency. The Government-prescribed term deposit rates&#13;
are lower than the rates obtained on Treasury bonds, as a result of which Eximbank's deposit base&#13;
contracted in 1993. Eximbank maintained over 7,000 accounts in 1993 (4,026 in foreign currencies and&#13;
3,009 in local currency), of which 1,673 accounts were held by non-residents.&#13;
53.           Total turnover of Eximbank's borrowings were D345 billion in 1993, of which US$22&#13;
million in foreign currency. These were all short-term  loans with terms ranging from  1-3 months,&#13;
obtained from domestic and foreign banks as well as the SBV. Eximbank has recently signed some&#13;

framework agrzaents with German banks on long-term credit facilities for financing up to 85% of the&#13;
contract value of Vietnamese imports from Gerrnany.&#13;
54.           Eximbank is currently seeking approval from the SBV to double its shares outstanding&#13;
from 125,000 to 250,000. As the price of one share is currently D 1,000,000, this increase would&#13;
substantially raise Eximbank's available capital. Its shareholders have already registered for this&#13;
increase so the issue is fully subscribed. Further equity issues will set aside 30% of shares for foreign&#13;
investors.&#13;
55.          Auditing Policies. Eximbank has a Comptroller appointed by the Board of Directors that&#13;
is responsible for ensuring compliance with the bank's internal control procedures. The Comptroller and&#13;
his staff review branch activities each month and will make inspections as warranted. Eximbank does&#13;
not currently have external audits conducted. The SBV conducts off-site inspections of Eximbank on a&#13;
regular basis. In addition, Eximbank's financial statements are certified by the SBV.&#13;
Financial Structure and Performance&#13;
56.           Structure. For the period 1991 to 1994, the total assets of Eximbank grew 139.1%, rising&#13;
from D 773.9 billion to D 1,850.3 billion. During the same period, total liabilities grew 149.5%, rising&#13;
from D 679.5 billion to D 1,695.1 billion. Total equity grew at a slower pace, rising from D 94.4 billion&#13;
in 1991 to D 155.3 billion in 1995, an increase of 64.5%. Between 1993 and 1994, total assets rose by&#13;
77.5%, total liabilities by 88.9%, and total equity by 6.9%. As a result, the ratio of debt to equity&#13;
increased from 88:12 in 1991 to 92:8 in 1994.&#13;
57.           The loan portfolio of Eximbank has undergone significant growth, increasing from D&#13;
291.1 billion in 1991 to D 943.5 billion in 1994, a rise of 224.1%. Deposits have grown at less than half&#13;
this rate, increasing from D 552.1 billion in 1991 to D 1,093.3 billion in 1994, a rise of 98.0%. During&#13;
this period, the loans to deposits ratio has varied considerably, rising from a low of 52.7% in 1991, to a&#13;
high of 132.6% in 1993, and stood at 86.3% in 1994.&#13;
58.          Profitability. Eximbank has consistently reported after tax profits. Net income has&#13;
grown steadily, from D 0.9 billion in 1991, to D 5.8 billion in 1992, to D 11.5 billion in 1993, and to D&#13;
19.8 billion in 1994. While non-interest income has increased in each of the last four years, interest&#13;
income actually fell in 1993, but stood at a high of D 47.2 billion in 1994. Eximbank increased financial&#13;
margin in each succeeding year during the period 1991 to 1994. Beginning with a negative margin of D&#13;
6.3 billion in 1991, it achieved a margin of D 16.2 billion in 1994. Eximbank stands out among the&#13;
SOCBs since non-interest income makes up nearly one-half of its total income revenues; moreover, non-&#13;
interest income has been increasing faster than non-interest expenses over the period 1991 to 1994,&#13;
further aiding bank profitability. The ratio of net income to average total assets rose from 0.6% in 1992,&#13;
to 1.1% in 1993, and 1.4% in 1994. In addition, the ratio of net income to total equity increased from&#13;
4.8% in 1992, to 7.9% in 1993, and to 13.2% in 1994.&#13;
59.          Eximbank is subject to a turnover tax assessed on the spread between income and&#13;
expenses and ranging from 6% to 25%, depending on the particular lending activity. In addition, it pays&#13;
a profit tax of 45% on net income. Over Eximbank's five-year existence, it has paid a total of D 48&#13;
billion in taxes to the Government. The ratios of dividends to share face value have been:&#13;

D. Industrial and Commercial Bank of Viet Nam (Incombank)&#13;
Introduction&#13;
60.          Background.  Industrial and Commercial Bank of Viet Nam  (Incombank) began&#13;
operations as an SOCB in 1988. It was created from the industry departments within the SBV.&#13;
61.          Business Activity. Incombank has traditionally been involved in providing credit to&#13;
industry and commerce. However, it is active in all fields of banking, particularly handling monetary,&#13;
credit and banking services for all types of economic entities, especially for the industrial, transportation,&#13;
post, trading and service sectors. These activities include receiving deposits; issuing time-bonds;&#13;
receiving funds from foreign and domestic banks; providing short- and medium-term financing in&#13;
domestic and foreign currencies for domestic economic organizations and individuals; foreign exchange&#13;
transactions; intemational banking; precious metals and gem trading; handling foreign and domestic&#13;
payment transactions; issuing bank guarantees; mortgages; leasing; real estate; participating in joint-&#13;
ventures and partnerships; and providing consulting and other services on banking and investment&#13;
activities. Incombank intends to maintain industrial and commercial lending as its core activities.&#13;
However, it is looking to expand its activities in precious metals and gem trading, and to engage in&#13;
securities trading when the market develops sufficiently.  Incombank has 50,000 customers and&#13;
maintains 60,000 accounts. Incombank has correspondent relationships with 385 foreign banks based in&#13;
40 countries.&#13;
62.          Incombank is actively pursuing joint-ventures with both domestic and foreign partners.&#13;
It is currently involved in 10 joint-ventures, owning between 10% to 50% of the shares outstanding.&#13;
Incombank also owns 10% of Saigon Income Bank, a joint-stock bank in Ho Chi Minh City. In addition,&#13;
it owns 50% of a joint-venture Indovina between Viet Nam and Indonesia.&#13;
63.          For 1994, the sectoral breakdown of Incombank's loan portfolio was as follows:&#13;
commerce (27.0%), industry (26.8%), other (20.9%), agriculture (14.9%), construction (6.4%),&#13;
transportation (3.9%), and forestry (0.9%). The term structure of Incombank's current loans outstanding&#13;
is predominantly short-term. Medium- and long-term loans outstanding presently account for 15% of the&#13;
loan portfolio; however, Incombank plans to boost this share to 25% in 1995. This reallocation is&#13;
disadvantageous to Incombank given the inverted structure of interest rates, but is necessary to comply&#13;
with SBV dictates. In addition, the SBV requires Incombank to make concessional loans to students and&#13;
veterans.&#13;
64.          Foreign Assistance.  Incombank has begun to access foreign capital.  In 1993, it&#13;
implemented the German-Vietnamese lending program for DEM 7 million, the Taiwanese program for&#13;
US$2.3 million and the EC program for the amount of US$8 million. Although the amount of funds&#13;
borrowed were small, they enabled Incombank to strengthen its relations with international financial&#13;
institutions, paving the way for the development of future foreign banking relationships.&#13;
Institutional Aspects&#13;
65.          Branch Network. Incombank is headquartered in Hanoi. It has an extensive network of&#13;
92 branches operating in all the important industrial and commercial centers in Viet Nam. In addition,&#13;
Incombank maintains 150 transaction offices and 300 savings offices. The headquarters manages and&#13;
operates the entire branch system and serves as the point of contact in international transactions. Branch&#13;
offices offer a full range of banking services and are staffed by 150 employees while transaction offices&#13;
provide a more limited range of services and typically employ from 10 to 15 staff. Savings offices are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
108                                    Annex 10&#13;
smaller still and seek to mobilize funds on the village and precinct level. Incombank is currently&#13;
implementing a strategy to upgrade its network of transaction offices into full-fledged branches. Its&#13;
market research has discovered that customers prefer to bank at branches rather than transaction offices,&#13;
and so it is using this expansion strategy to expand its customer base and to increase funds mobilization.&#13;
Incombank plans to transform one-third of its transaction offices into branches by 1997 and the&#13;
remainder by the year 2000. This effort will entail significant staff increases.&#13;
66.           Strategy and Planning. Incombank is in the process of preparing a comprehensive&#13;
institutional strategy governing its overall operations until the year 2000.  The philosophical&#13;
underpinning of this strategy is to enhance the economic prosperity of the economy. The major&#13;
objectives of this new strategy will be to: (i) increase assets; (ii) increase asset quality; (iii) enhance&#13;
credit risk management; (iv) increase domestic funds mobilization; (v) promote staff training; (vi)&#13;
modernize bank facilities; and (vii) increase international banking operations.&#13;
67.           The General Director leads a team  that includes representatives from  several key&#13;
departments in drafting an annual business plan. This plan details specific operational, institutional and&#13;
financial targets and is subjected to internal review before being presented to the Board of Directors.&#13;
The Board of Directors holds substantive discussions of this plan in its Bi-annual Review Meeting and its&#13;
Annual Review Meeting before approving it.&#13;
68.           Organizational Structure. A Board of Directors presides over Incombank and acts as an&#13;
advisor to the Board of Management. The Board of Directors exercises advisory and decision making&#13;
power and coordinates both Incombank's internal and external relations. The chief executive officer of&#13;
Incombank is the General Manager, who is appointed by the Prime Minister upon the recommendation of&#13;
the Governor of the SBV. The General Manager also chairs the Board of Directors, which further&#13;
includes the First Deputy Director, two representatives from the branches, a representative from the&#13;
SBV, and one from another government agency. The Board of Management includes the General&#13;
Director and five Deputy General Directors.&#13;
69.           Staffing and Training. Staff levels at Incombank have remained fairly steady. They&#13;
stood at 11,009 in 1991, 10,656 in 1992, 10,495 in 1993, and 10,620 in 1994. Incombank is upgrading&#13;
its staff resources by recruiting more qualified personnel. New recruits must now pass an examination&#13;
administered by Incombank and must also possess a foreign language capability (preferably English).&#13;
Regarding education credentials, Incombank will target graduates from the economics university, other&#13;
graduates specializing in banking, and graduates from the banking colleges. In an effort to retain&#13;
qualified staff, Incombank offers salary increases related to performance to supplement base pay levels.&#13;
It is also pressing the GOV to raise the base salary scale, which governs the pay levels at all the SOCBs,&#13;
in order to remain competitive with the private banks which are not restricted by these government-&#13;
mandated restricted.&#13;
70.           Incombank has trained 3,352 staff, overwhelmingly in domestic programs. Of this total,&#13;
1,093 received operational training, 86 received computer training, 1,303 received English training, and&#13;
80 received legal training. Incombank has indicated that it will concentrate its training efforts on English&#13;
training and operational knowledge. Incombank is also enhancing its training programs. It has set up&#13;
two new training centers in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. These will focus on providing technical and&#13;
professional training of a short-term nature, for both high and low level staff. Incombank is currently in&#13;
the process of retraining its staff in view of the migration of the banking sector away from central&#13;
planning into a more market oriented environment. Professional and technical training will be tailored to&#13;
individual needs and will be supplemented with annual refresher courses. Training in new services will&#13;
be provided as warranted. Staff managing the computer networks at the branch level will receive&#13;
specialized training, and technical staff at the central level will attend short-term technical refresher&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
109                                  Annex 10&#13;
courses. Overseas training and refresher courses will also be provided to management personnel.&#13;
Managers needing training in the provision of new services will be eligible for overseas training of one&#13;
year and upwards. Incombank has sent 30 staff for overseas training.&#13;
Operations&#13;
71.           Credit. Incombank has developed manuals for bank officers covering areas such as&#13;
guarantees, short-term loans, medium- and long-term loans, and funds mobilization. These are amended&#13;
annually to keep them current with changing business environments. Branch managers at major&#13;
branches have the authority to make loans up to D 30 billion for individual clients, while the limit at&#13;
smaller branches is D 15 billion. Credits of less than D 10 billion are then monitored by the individual&#13;
branches, while those exceeding D 10 billion are monitored by headquarters. Incombank reduces its risk&#13;
exposure by lending in proportion to the value of collateral secured. Each branch is allocated a certain&#13;
amount of funds each year based upon the quality of the branch loan portfolio, the ratio of overdue debt,&#13;
and the capabilities of the branch in an effort to further mitigate risk. Incombank is obliged to make&#13;
loans at concessional rates to students and veterans.&#13;
72.           With the dismantling of the monobank system, Incombank inherited bad debts of D 500&#13;
billion of the SOEs. These frozen debts are no longer accounted for as loans and are handled on the&#13;
balance sheet on the asset side as D 500 billion under "Other Assets" and D 500 billion under "Due from&#13;
SBV", with a corresponding D 1,000 billion under "Borrowings". In order to address problem loans, the&#13;
SBV allows that Incombank set aside 10% of its net income. Incombank reports that its loan portfolio is&#13;
in relatively good shape, and that only 0.15% of total loans outstanding are problem loans.&#13;
73.           Audit Policy. Incombank currently conducts only internal audits. The auditing function&#13;
is performed by the Accounting and Finance Department and by the chief accountant. It establishes&#13;
accounting procedures and produces monthly, quarter and yearly reports to the Board of Management.&#13;
In addition, the SBV and MOF jointly supervise Incombank's accounts and activities. However,&#13;
Incombank will undergo an external audit of its accounts in 1995, financed by Swedish bilateral&#13;
assistance under a program supported by the Structural Adjustment Credit. Loans below D 10 billion are&#13;
monitored at the branch level., while larger loans are monitored by headquarters.&#13;
Financial Structure and Performance&#13;
74.           Structure. For the period 1991 to 1994, the total assets of Incombank roughly doubled,&#13;
rising from D 5,080.4 to D 10,178.8. During the same period, total liabilities increased at a slightly&#13;
slower rate, rising from D 5,017.4 billion to D 9,537.1 billion. By contrast, total equity increased by only&#13;
46.8%, growing from D 325.2 billion to 477.5 billion. Between 1993 and 1994, total assets increased by&#13;
28.2%, and total liabilities by 31.2%, while total equity decreased by 13.8%. Incombank has a small&#13;
capital base; the debt to equity ratio was 94:6 in 1991 and 96:4 in 1994.&#13;
75.          Incombank's total loans outstanding rose 121.7% between 1991 and 1994, growing from&#13;
D 3,013.2 billion to D 6,681.0. Deposits grew even faster, rising from 2,680.5 billion in 1991 to D&#13;
7,563.5 billion in 1994, an increase of 182.2%. Recent growth in time deposit accounts form most of the&#13;
rise in deposits. As a result, the loans to deposits ratio for 1994 stood at 88.3%. Between 1993 and&#13;
1994, loans increased by 8.6% and deposits by 73.6%.&#13;
76.          Profitability. Incombank has been steadily increasing its profitability. Net income rose&#13;
from D 40.0 billion in 1991, to D 45.3 billion in 1992, D 80.5 billion in 1993, and to D 106.0 billion in&#13;
1994. These increases represent annual average increases of 40.8%. Between 1991 and 1994, interest&#13;
income grew from D 417.0 billion to D 1,858.0 billion, or an increase of 345.5%. During the same&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
110                                         Annex 10&#13;
period, interest expenses rose from D 298.6 billion to D 1,270.4 billion, or an increase of 325.4%. As a&#13;
result, the ratio of interest expenses to interest income declined slightly from 71.6% to 68.4%; however,&#13;
this ratio was as low as 59.6% in 1993. In 1994, interest income represented 97.5% of total revenues.&#13;
Also in that year, interest from loans accounted for over three-quarters of interest income, with interest&#13;
from deposits making up most of the rest. Non-interest expenses have been rising rapidly, but have not&#13;
eroded earnings. Salary expenses have been rising, growing from 0.6% of average total assets in 1991 to&#13;
1.7%  in 1994. However, net income to average total assets increased from  0.8%  in 1992, to 1.1%  in&#13;
1993, and remained steady at 1.1% in 1994. By contrast, net income to average equity increased from&#13;
10.7% in 1992, to 15.0% in 1993, and to 20.6% in 1994. Incombank is subject to a 6% capital use&#13;
charge levied on capital allocated by the GOV, a 15% turnover tax on financial margin, and a 45% profit&#13;
tax on net income.&#13;

E. Viet Nam Maritime Commercial Stock Bank (Maritimebank)&#13;
Introduction&#13;
77.          Background. The Viet Nam Maritime Commercial Stock Bank (Maritimebank) is a&#13;
joint-stock bank and was licensed to operate by Working Permit No. 0001/NH-GP, granted on June 8,&#13;
1991, by the Governor of the SBV, soon after the legislation on financial institutions and banking came&#13;
into effect. One July 12, 1991, the headquarters of Maritimebank opened in Haiphong. Besides being&#13;
the first joint-stock bank to receive a permit to begin operations, Maritimebank was also the first one to&#13;
publish its balance sheet in the newspapers.&#13;
73.          Maritimebank currently has 52 shareholders, comprising  both institutions and&#13;
individuals. Most shareholding institutions are active in the maritime and telecommunications sectors.&#13;
At the end of 1994, the largest shareholders were the Viet Nam Directorate General of Post and&#13;
Telecommunications (10.7% of total shares outstanding), Viet Nam Shipping Company (9.2%), Civil&#13;
Administration of Viet Nam (8.4%), Viet Nam Ocean Shipping Company (7.4%), and Viet Nam&#13;
National Maritime Bureau (7.0%).&#13;
79.          Business Actiyity. Maritimebank offers banking and financial services to serve the&#13;
business needs of its shareholders, and to contribute to the development of the economic sectors in which&#13;
they are active. Modeled as a bank of economic groups, Maritimebank closely links its activities with&#13;
the business of major economic enterprises which are, on the one hand, its shareholders and, on the other&#13;
hand, its customers. It has been active in an ADB-funded project to upgrade the county's ports and has&#13;
expressed interest in participating in a Bank-funded project to upgrade Highway 5.&#13;
80.          Maritimebank's principal financial products are letters of credits and lending. However,&#13;
it also handles domestic and foreign transactions by means of documentary credit, collection, and&#13;
remittances; participates in foreign exchange trading; mobilizes domestic and foreign currency reserves;&#13;
collects investment funds; handles remittances from overseas Vietnamese; and trades gold and other&#13;
precious metals and gems. Maritimebank has expressed an interest in moving into areas such as leasing,&#13;
credit cards and government securities.&#13;
81.          Maritimebank has a small investment portfolio. In partnership with the Ministry of&#13;
Trade, it has invested D 2.0 billion in Vicocimex, an export/import company in Ho Chi Minh City. It has&#13;
invested another D 2.0 billion in an insurance company, also in Ho Chi Minh City, and is also involved&#13;
in a garment company in Ho Chi Minh City.&#13;
Institutional Aspects&#13;
82.          Branch Network. Maritimebank is headquartered in Haiphong and has five branches in&#13;
Can Tho, Da Nang, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Quang Ninh. Maritimebank plans to expand its&#13;
operations into every major commercial and economic area of the country, with a particular focus on&#13;
ports, and to enhance its inter-provincial network. As part of its expansion strategy, Maritimebank plans&#13;
to open three sub-branches in Ho Chi Minh City and another in Hanoi by the end of 1995, and to open&#13;
new branches in Qui Nuon and Vung Tau soon thereafter. Maritimebank has correspondent banking&#13;
relationships with 155 banks.&#13;
83.          Strategy and Planning. The Board of Directors develops the general strategy guiding&#13;
Maritimebank's operations in consultation with the Board of Management for presentation to the&#13;
Meeting of Shareholders. Maritimebank's current strategy is to expand its branch network and to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
115                                    Annex 10&#13;
increase its capital resources; it hopes to increase its share capital to D 600 billion by the year 2000. The&#13;
Board of Management is responsible for producing an annual business plan. The business plan is&#13;
developed in the context of Maritimebank's strategic objectives, and contains detailed financial,&#13;
operational and institutional targets. These are of both a qualitative and quantitative nature. This plan is&#13;
discussed each June at the Meeting of Shareholders. Maritimebank has been in the fortunate position of&#13;
exceeding its targeted performance each year. Some major targets for the 1995 business plan are to raise&#13;
legal capital to D 200 billion, increase customer deposits to D 600 to D 700 billion, and raise US$20&#13;
million in foreign borrowings.&#13;
84.           Maritimebank is currently implementing an ambitious project to modernize its&#13;
accounting and reporting systems so that it will be able to produce balance sheet, income statement, and&#13;
cash flow statements that conform to internationally accepted principles. Maritimebank expects to&#13;
produce these new financial statements for its accounts in 1995. Despite these changes, Maritimebank&#13;
will retain the capability of reporting financial information to SBV as required. The management of&#13;
Maritimebank has recognized that it most adopt international accounting standards to attract international&#13;
investors, to better conduct business with overseas businesses, and to aid in share price determination.&#13;
Maritimebank also expects that these steps will also enhance the bank's management information system&#13;
by providing managers with more useful data.&#13;
85.           Organizational Structure. A Meeting of Shareholders convenes annually. One of its&#13;
primary functions is to select members of the Board of Governors to represent shareholder interests.&#13;
Members on the Board serve for five years and their selection requires the approval of the SBV. The&#13;
Board meets every two to three months to discuss important bank affairs. It also selects the four&#13;
members of the Board of Management, which comprises Maritimebank's senior managers, including the&#13;
Managing Director, who is the bank's top officer. The head office in Haiphong is composed of a&#13;
Managing Director's Office (which has a credit section, and international banking section, and a&#13;
marketing section), and Accounting-Statistics Department, and Administration-Personnel Department,&#13;
and an electronics data processing center. Depending on the nature of the activity, the branches report to&#13;
functional departments at the bank's headquarters in Haiphong.&#13;
86.           Staffing and Training. Maritimebank plans to increase its staffing in 1995 from 200&#13;
employees to 261 in support of its expansion efforts.  Maritimebank currently recruits university&#13;
graduates with a background in banking and finance, skills in computer technology, and proficiency in&#13;
English. These candidates then undergo one month of training by Maritimebank, after which they are&#13;
required to pass a formal examination. Maritimebank has plans to recruit promising candidates wshile&#13;
they are still in college and has successfully piloted such a program at a secondary school in Haiphong.&#13;
87.           The salary structure of Maritimebank is approved by its Board of Directors and is not&#13;
subject to the dictates of the GOV. The salaries to Maritimebank employees are therefore quite high&#13;
relative to SOCB employees, and are further supplemented by a bonus package. These bonuses are not&#13;
directly linked to individual performance, but are instead determined by overall bank profitability and&#13;
staff level. While staff turnover is not a serious issue at Maritimebank, senior managers voiced concern&#13;
that they could not match the salaries offered by foreign industrial concerns.&#13;
88.           Maritimebank is committed to training and retraining to its staff to enhance their&#13;
capabilities. While conceding the importance of training, bank managers noted that the associated costs&#13;
were very expensive to the bank in terms of both budgetary and staff resources. Foreign language&#13;
training is part of the training regimen. Regarding external training, Maritimebank is planning to send&#13;
30 staff for overseas training this year. It has reached an agreement with ANZ Bank to train some of its&#13;
employees in Australia, and has also approached some banks in its correspondent network about&#13;
providing training courses for Maritimebank personnel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
116                                  Annex 10&#13;
Operations&#13;
89.           Credit Policy. Maritimebank conducts its credit decisions in full compliance with SBV&#13;
regulations and internal bank policies. It acts with due care to mitigate credit risk and conducts rigorous&#13;
loan appraisals. Maritimebank requires its borrowers to make deposits and to extend collateral as part of&#13;
its risk reduction strategy. Approval limits are governed by loan and branch size. The larger branches in&#13;
Hanoi, Haiphong, and Ho Chi Minh City may approve loans of up to D 1.5 billion per transaction, while&#13;
smaller branches may approve loans of up to D 1.0 billion. Loans of greater value require the approval&#13;
of the Managing Director. It is anticipated that the credit limits stipulated above will be raised during&#13;
1995. In any case, all loans need to be reviewed by the Risk Prevention Bureau. The Risk Prevention&#13;
Bureau devises credit risk regulations and policies and is represented in each of the bank's branches. For&#13;
approval, loans currently require the signatures of four bank officers: the branch manager (or Managing&#13;
Director), the chief accountant, the credit risk officer, and the head credit risk officer. Maritimebank is&#13;
currently looking to streamline its loan approval process. Maritimebank imposes a single borrower limit&#13;
of 10% of legal capital.&#13;
90.           Maritimebank has developed policies and procedures in order to assess the credit risk of&#13;
its client base. When drafting a letter of credit, Maritimebank may require a deposit of up to 100% of the&#13;
credit for new customers. For established customers, Maritimebank typically segregates borrowers into&#13;
three categories depending on their credit worthiness, with the most credit worthy required to make&#13;
deposits equivalent to 10% of the value of the credit, and the least credit worthy are required to put up&#13;
between 20% and 30%. When making a loan, Maritimebank reduces risk by requiring collateral. It will&#13;
typically make a loan up to 70% of the value of collateral for physical goods such as ships, inventories,&#13;
or imported and exported goods, and 50% for most other classes. Maritimebank makes few medium-&#13;
and long-term loans. Most of its short-term lending is for self-liquidating transactions. Maritimebank&#13;
has reported that 3% of the loans in its portfolio are currently experiencing problems. Credit officers&#13;
monitor borrower repayments, and Maritimebank has a number of policies in place to mitigate potential&#13;
problems with loan repayments. Responsibility for collections shifts to the Overdue Department for&#13;
loans more than seven days overdue.&#13;
91.           Resource Mobilization. Savings mobilization has doubled in each year of operations.&#13;
Maritimebank increased its share capital from D 40 billion to D 60 billion in 1993. It is seeking to&#13;
further increase its share capital to D 200 billion, and hopes to receive approval in late 1995 or early&#13;
1996. It will offer 30% of these new shares to foreign investors.&#13;
92.           Auditing. Maritimebank has a Board of Supervision which performs an internal audit&#13;
function. It reports to the Board of Directors and has a representative in each of Maritimebank's&#13;
branches. The accounts of Maritimebank are not reviewed by an external auditor on a regular basis.&#13;
However, in 1992, an international auditing firm based in Hong Kong performed an audit of&#13;
Maritimebank in connection with the establishment of a country fund for Viet Nam. The SBV exercises&#13;
a supervisory control of Maritimebank to ensure it is compliance with Vietnamese banking regulations.&#13;
Financial Structure and Performance&#13;
93.           Structure. For the period 1991 to 1994, the total assets of Maritimebank have grown&#13;
more than four fold, rising from D 136.7 billion in 1991 to D 733.4 billion in 1994. During the same&#13;
period, total liabilifies grew 664.6%, rising from D 84.3 billion to D 644.8 billion, while total equity&#13;
grew 69.2%, from D 52.3 billion to D 88.6 billion. Between 1993 and 1994, total assets rose by 40.2%,&#13;
total liabilities by 44.8% and total equity by 13.7%. Because liabilities have been increasing faster than&#13;
equity, Maritimebank's debt to equity ratio increased from 62:38 in 1991 to 88:12 in 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
117                                        Annex 10&#13;
94.             Maritimebank's loan portfolio has undergone significant growth, rising from  D 34.1&#13;
billion in 1991 to D 435.5 billion in 1994, an annual average growth rate of 148.3%. Deposits also grew&#13;
dramatically, if somewhat less so, increasing from D 82.8 billion in 1991 to D 440.8 billion in 1994,&#13;
representing an annual average growth rate of 83.4%. Consequently, the loans to deposits ratio for 1994&#13;
stood at 98.8%. Between 1993 and 1994, loans increased by 42.0% while deposits increased by only&#13;
12.4%&#13;
95.             Profitability. Between 1991 to 1994, net income has increased at an annual average rate&#13;
of 133.2%, rising from D 1.5 billion to D 16.9 billion. During the same period, interest income rose&#13;
from D 3.2 billion to D 53.4 billion, and interest expenses from D 0.7 billion to D 15.3 billion. As a&#13;
result, the ratio of interest expenses to interest income rose from 22.1% in 1991 to 28.8% in 1994.&#13;
Maritimebank earns virtually all of its interest income from its loans; furthermore, interest income&#13;
accounted for 86.3% of total revenues in 1994. Maritimebank has been containing its costs. When&#13;
compared to average total assets, salaries increased from 0.5% in 1992 to 0.6% in 1993, but&#13;
administrative expenses declined from 1.3% to 0.9%. Maritimebank has consistently reported after-tax&#13;
profits. The ratio of net income to average total assets was 2.5% in 1992, 2.2% in 1993 and 2.7% in&#13;
1994. At the same time, net income to average total equity rose from 8.9% in 1992, to 12.6% in 1993,&#13;
and to 20.4% in 1994. Maritimebank pays a standard 45% profit tax. In addition, it pays a revenue tax&#13;
which varies from 6% to 15% depending on the type of income. In 1994, Maritimebank paid profit taxes&#13;
of D 13.9 billion and a turnover taxes of D 6.6 billion.&#13;

F. Bank for Foreign Trade of Viet Nam (Vietcombank)&#13;
Introduction&#13;
96.           Backgzround. The Bank for Foreign Trade of Viet Nam (Vietcombank) was established&#13;
in 1963 to handle trade finance and management of foreign exchange for the country. The latter function&#13;
has been gradually transferred to SBV after the creation of a two-tier banking system.&#13;
97.           Business Activity. The core business activity of Vietcombank is the provision of trade&#13;
financing. However, Vietcombank is active in a number of other areas, including: short-, medium- and&#13;
long-term loan facilities; funds transfer; deposit taking; documentary credits; guarantees; foreign&#13;
exchange; credit cards; spot, forward and swap transactions; and consultancy services. Vietcombank is&#13;
kae on enhancing funds mobilization and expanding its investment activities, especially as regards the&#13;
private sector. The current loan portfolio is concentrated in the trade sectors (46%), industry (22%) and&#13;
agriculture (12%). It is moving into retail banking in order to more easily mobilize savings and to&#13;
expand its client base of individuals. Vietcombank is using its trade expertise and its strong relationships&#13;
with its corporate clients to expand into areas such as merchant banking. It is focusing its lending&#13;
activities on a range of industrial sectors it finds attractive, including oil, light and heavy industry,&#13;
cement, construction materials, textiles, and agricultural products.  In light of these activities,&#13;
Vietcombank believes that its chief competitors will be Eximbank and Incombank.&#13;
98.           Vietcombank has established several subsidiaries involved in leasing, general trade,&#13;
hotels, consulting and financing, the latter in Hong Kong. It is further looking to set up a subsidiary in&#13;
real estate development and a finance company subsidiary in Moscow. Vietcombank has been active in&#13;
seeking out investment opportunities. It is involved in several joint-stock companies, with a 10% share&#13;
in Ziadinh, a bank in Ho Chi Minh City, a 5% share in the Military Bank, a 4% share in Eximbank, and a&#13;
small interest in a hotel. In 1993, Vietcombank established Firstvina Bank, a joint-venture in which it&#13;
has a 50% stake with Korea First Bank. Vietcombank also has a 50% share in a shipping concern known&#13;
as Vietfrachd. Vietcombank is investigating the establishment of other joint-ventures and is currently&#13;
planning a joint-venture consulting outfit with Paribas and a joint-venture property company with Keppel&#13;
of Singapore.  While Vietcombank has a direct interest in ensuring the financial success of its&#13;
investments, it is aware of the dangers involved extending loans to support these activities.&#13;
Consequently, it does not envisage substantial lending after an initial start-up period which it estimates to&#13;
be about six months.&#13;
Institutional Aspects&#13;
99.    Branch Network. Vietcombank is headquartered in Hanoi (with 480 staff), and operates 17&#13;
branches and 10 sub-branches. The branch in Ho Chi Minh City is the largest and employs around 300&#13;
people, while the smaller branches are run by 40 to 50 staff. Vietcombank has no immediate plans to&#13;
open new branches, but plans to expand its sub-branch network in 1995 by opening three to four sub-&#13;
branches in Hanoi and one to two in Ho Chi Minh City. Its current plans for expansion focus on building&#13;
up its sub-branch network over the next few years in Da Nang, Haiphong, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City,&#13;
Quay Ninh, and Vung Tau, in an effort to support its drive into retail banking. Vietcombank is also&#13;
interested in expanding into export processing zones and other specialized industrial zones.&#13;
Vietcombank maintains overseas offices in France, Hong Kong and Sweden.&#13;
100.          Strategy and Planning.  As part of annual planning, each branch provides detailed&#13;
operational and financial information to the General Affairs Department at headquarters. Headquarters&#13;
then consolidates this information and delivers it to the Board of Directors in October or November. The&#13;
Board of Directors discusses this information and produces a business plan early in the year. This plan&#13;

typically specifies the funds each branch is expected to mobilize, informs them of the total credit they&#13;
can lend, and the total amount they can borrow from headquarters. The Board also sets the overall&#13;
strategy for the bank and continually monitors management progress in meeting its objectives. The&#13;
Board meets twice a year and formalizes the targets and objectives to be achieved over the next six&#13;
months or over the next year. Based on such factors as past performance, market conditions, and&#13;
liquidity constraints, the Board adjusts these targets and the methods needed to reach them. The Board&#13;
also makes decisions concerning new products and services. Vietcombank sends its business plans to&#13;
SBV and MOF to aid them in their policy decisions.&#13;
101.         Organizational Structure. A Board of Governors oversees bank activities. It is entirely&#13;
an internal unit; 11 of its members are senior bank officers, and it is chaired by the Director General of&#13;
Vietcombank. Directly under the Board of Governors is the Board of Management, which is headed by&#13;
the Director General and includes all top headquarters and branch managers. Four Deputy Directors&#13;
General report to the Director General, who also administers the Personnel Department. The Board of&#13;
Management meets regularly and deals with any activity that senior management deems important. It&#13;
also sets bank-wide policies and procedures. Under the Board of Management are the individual&#13;
branches, an Operations Center at headquarters (comprising Planning and Dealing, Payment Center,&#13;
Credit Security, Export Settlement, Import Settlement, Remittance Section, Cash Section, Accounting&#13;
Section, Card Payment Section, and Saving Section), and a further nine departments, also at headquarters&#13;
(comprising General Affairs, International Relations, Personnel, Consulting, Investment Guarantee,&#13;
Treasury-Accounting, Over-Due Debt Management, Electronic Data Processing, and Administration).&#13;
102.         Staffing and Training. Vietcombank currently employs about 1,700 staff. Over 60% of&#13;
its staff have college educations. Vietcombank recruits qualified university graduates with a background&#13;
in banking and finance, who have attained proficiency in a foreign language, and who have received a&#13;
certificate in computer operations. Potential recruits are required to sit for an examination administered&#13;
by Vietcombank and to undergo foreign language testing. Vietcombank ties its hiring levels to expected&#13;
growth, which has been significant in recent years.  Still, competition is very keen to work at&#13;
Vietcombank; as an example, 150 applicants recently applied for 10 positions. The policies governing&#13;
promotion have recently been revamped. Promotion decisions are now made by a group of senior&#13;
management where previously they had been made by an employee's immediate supervisor, often with&#13;
interference from the Party, trade unions, etc. It was believed that the old system favored personal&#13;
relationships at the expense of professional competency.&#13;
103.         As with other SOCBs, the base salary rate is subject to yearly decisions negotiated with&#13;
the MOF, SBV and the Ministry of Labor. In an effort to retain qualified staff, Vietcombank also&#13;
negotiates a bonus structure that allows employees to increase their pay in a manner commensurate with&#13;
their performance. This is accomplished by a bonus system which is paid on a quarterly basis.&#13;
Nevertheless, the compensation system remains highly administered and well below the levels of foreign&#13;
and private banks.&#13;
104.         The management of Vietcombank views training as an area critical to the bank's success.&#13;
Orientation training is provided to all new recruits.  Vietcombank has established an internal training&#13;
center in Ho Chi Minh City and also sends staff to a foreign language college. Vietcombank also&#13;
supports external training, and actively uses its correspondent network to provide training expertise and&#13;
to fund the bank's external training efforts. In 1994, Vietcombank sent 30 managers abroad for training,&#13;
mostly to attend short-term courses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
123                                  Annex 10&#13;
Operations&#13;
105.         Credit. The individual branches have a great deal of latitude in making credit allocation&#13;
decisions. (Further evidence of this autonomy is the fact that branches have their own balance sheets.)&#13;
All branches are given a lending allocation each year which they may not exceed. The current level for&#13;
the Ho Chi Minh Branch is US$100 million. The branches may then allocate credit as they see fit, but&#13;
headquarters approval is required for medium-term loans exceeding US$1.0 million in Ho Chi Minh&#13;
City, and US$0.5 million in all other branches. At headquarters, such loan approvals are handled by the&#13;
Investment Department and require the approval of either the Director General or the Deputy Director&#13;
General. There is no such approval limit for short-term loans.&#13;
106.         Vietcombank considers project appraisal to be the crucial element in making credit&#13;
decisions.  Since financial statements in Viet Nam  are of dubious value, the credit manual that&#13;
Vietcombank has compiled is little more than simple list of procedures. Given that credit risk is very&#13;
high, Vietcombank exercises great prudence in making credit decisions. There are no credit committees&#13;
and so branch directors make the final decisions on loans subject to the policies deiineated above. Once&#13;
a credit decision has been made, all follow-up on monitoring the credit is manual. Branches currently&#13;
make weekly, monthly and quarterly reports to headquarters covering a variety of information on credit&#13;
outstanding, total assets and funds mobilization.  Vietcombank intends to computerize its credit&#13;
monitoring operations pending the upgrading of its computer network.&#13;
107.         In order to deal with problem loans, Vietcombank is only allowed to set aside 5% of its&#13;
equity in a special reserve account, but there are no regulations governing how these funds are to be&#13;
utilized to deal with loan problems.  To mitigate potential losses, Vietcombank requires private&#13;
borrowers to put up collateral which it could then auction off to recover its money. Recovering money&#13;
from SOEs is more problematic since Vietcombank would need to obtain their willingness and capacity&#13;
to repay in the event of default.&#13;
108.         Resource Mobilization. In a bid to increase resource mobilization, Vietcombank has&#13;
expanded into retail banking and increased its branch network. It has also expanded its range of services&#13;
by offering savings accounts and certificates of deposits with maturities of one, two and three years.&#13;
Vietcombank has also raised money through bilateral credit agreements with its correspondent banks and&#13;
through pre-export loans. Vietcombank has also expressed an interest in raising funds on the Eurobond&#13;
market in the future.&#13;
109.         Auditing. Vietcombank's financial statements meet the requirements of the SBV, but&#13;
are not prepared according to internationally accepted accounting practices. Vietcombank's financial&#13;
statements are not currently examined by an external auditor. The internal audit function is performed&#13;
by the Comptroller Department which supervises compliance of both headquarters and branch activities.&#13;
This Department functions as an independent unit. It is staffed by five personnel at headquarters, and is&#13;
supplemented by additional staff from other departments as necessary. In theory, the Comptroller&#13;
Department is responsible for auditing the full scope of Vietcombank's internal financial accounts and&#13;
controls and procedures but, in practice, it confines itself merely to the checking accuracy of financial&#13;
information. Vietcombank is developing a plan to enhance its information technology and management&#13;
information systems.&#13;
Financial Structure and Performance&#13;
110.         Structure. Total assets for Vietcombank increased 35.8% from 1991 to 1994, rising from&#13;
D 12,315.7 billion in 1991, to D 14,421.8 billion in 1992, before dropping to D 13,399.1 billion in 1993,&#13;
and rising again in 1994 to D 16,727.1 billion. Total liabilities followed a similar trend, rising from D&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
124                                         Annex 10&#13;
12,231.8 billion in 1991, to D 13,939.4 billion in 1992, and falling to D 12,877.1 billion in 1993, and&#13;
rising to D 16,201.6 billion in 1994. Total equity, on the other hand, rose in each year, increasing from&#13;
D 337.5 billion in 1991 to D 525.6 billion in 1994, an increase of 527.0%. As a result, while the ratio of&#13;
debt to equity is high, it has been falling, and dropped from 99:1 in 1991 to 97:3 in 1994.&#13;
Ill.            The loan portfolio for Vietcombank has been growing consistently, rising from  D&#13;
2,784.4 billion in 1991, to D 7,134.5 billion in 1994, an increase of 156.2%. Deposits grew dramatically&#13;
from 1991 to 1992, rising from D 6,926.3 billion to D 10,391.2, but rose to only D 11,921.1 billion in&#13;
1994. As a result, the ratio of loans to deposits decreased from 40.2% in 1991 to 36.1% in 1992, but&#13;
jumped to 55.7% in 1993, and stood at 59.8% in 1994.&#13;
112.            Profitability.  Vietcombank appears to be a highly profitable bank. It recorded a net&#13;
income of D 166.0 billion on total revenues of D 593.2 billion in 1994. While interest income has been&#13;
rising, this growth has been coming from loan income, as deposit income has dropped slightly over the&#13;
last two years. While the financial margin of Vietcombank increased from D 497.6 billion in 1993 to D&#13;
512.9 billion in 1994, the ratio of interest expenses to interest income increased from 30.2% to 46.3% in&#13;
those years. Vietcombank has a low cost structure. In 1994, non-interest expenses (net of taxes) were D&#13;
135.4 billion, and salaries were just D 15.3 billion.&#13;
113.            Vietcombank has an unusually high tax burden. It is subject to a 45%  profit, a 2%&#13;
capital use tax, and a turnover tax ranging from 6% to 30%. Vietcombank must allocate its net income&#13;
among three different funds: a bonus fund, a welfare fund, and a business promotion fund. However, the&#13;
maximum annual contributions to these funds are determined by the Government, and any profit after&#13;
such allocations reverts to the Government.&#13;

VIET NAM&#13;
PAYMENT SYSTEM AND BANK MODERNIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Cost Recovery of the Inter-bank Payment System&#13;
1.           It is envisaged that the SBV will operate the inter-bank clearing and settlement systems&#13;
(IBPS and SAPS), incurring one-off start-up costs and on-going operating costs. These costs will be&#13;
recovered by charging direct participants (settlement banks).&#13;
2.            A simple model has been constructed to assist the SBV in the estimation of break-even&#13;
prices on the basis of projected volumes and estimated costs. The components of the model are&#13;
described below.&#13;
Projected Volumes&#13;
3.            We have projected total annual volumes for the period 1995-2003 on a range of&#13;
assumptions regarding the rate of growth of inter-bank payments. These projections recognize the two&#13;
major influences on the rate of growth of non-cash payment volumes:&#13;
(a)   the rate of economic growth;&#13;
(b)   the rate of migration from cash to non-cash payments, driven by the level of confidence&#13;
in the banking system and the technical quality and cost efficiency of payment services&#13;
(including intra-bank payment systems).&#13;
4.            The baseline for projections is provided by the quarter 4 1994 inter-bank payment&#13;
volumes provided by the six banks included within the scope of this project. Details regarding the&#13;
information requested and supplied are set out in Appendix 3 of the Statement of User Requirements (in&#13;
project files).&#13;
5.            Total inter-bank payment volumes for Q4 1994 have been estimated using the following&#13;
formula:&#13;
*  0.9*sum of all reported inter-bank payments (out and in)/2.&#13;
[0.9* reduces the total number of reported payments by 10% - an estimate of the&#13;
proportion involving a bank not within the scope the project&#13;
/2 allows for the fact that all payments between the reporting banks will have been&#13;
reported twice].&#13;
* Where a bank did not report a quarterly total, it was estimated as follows:&#13;
* 78*(highest daily total+lowest daily total)/2&#13;
[78 is the number of business days in the quarter].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
129                                   Annex 11&#13;
This approach yields a Q4 1994 total approachiniLg 300.000 - the starting point for projections.&#13;
The model includes four scenarios for payment growth for the period 1995-2003:&#13;
(i)    10% growth per annum to 1997; 15% growth after the first expansion of&#13;
new systems&#13;
(ii)    10% growth per annum to 1997; 30% growth thereafter&#13;
(iii)   20% growth per annum to 1997; 30% growth thereafter&#13;
(iv)   20% growth per annum to 1997; 60% growth thereafiter.&#13;
It is assumed that new settlement banks will join the system after 1998, but that this will not result in an&#13;
increase in inter-bank payment volumes: payments will be captured directly from new participants,&#13;
instead of via other banks acting as their agents.&#13;
NB    These volume projections provide only a rough guide, since current estimates are&#13;
unreliable and current and future growth rates uncertain.&#13;
Estimated Costs&#13;
6.            Base costs incurred during 1995-99 are not volume-dependent and are derived from the&#13;
project cost estimates. The one-off, start-up costs (covering hardware, project management, acceptance&#13;
testing, training and documentation) incurred by new joiners will include SBV charges set to recover in&#13;
full the cost of implementation services that it provides. Given this policy of full cost recovery, new&#13;
joiner costs are not included in these cost estimates. Annual maintenance costs are estimated at 15% of&#13;
hardware and software cost from 1999 onwards.&#13;
7.           IT operations will be locally resourced from 1999, at an average annual employment cost&#13;
per full-time staff member (in 1995 prices) of US$2,500, with an initial staffing level of 5. IT operations&#13;
will include a technical help desk facility. A sum (initially US$5,000 in 1995 prices) is included to cover&#13;
the cost of transport, materials and voice communications.  It is assumed that staffing and other&#13;
requirements will increase at an annual rate of 20% as transaction volumes, the number of participants,&#13;
and the real-time gross settlement component of the system increase.&#13;
8.            Business operations will be locally resourced from  1997, at an average annual&#13;
employment cost per full-time staff member (in 1995 prices) of US$3,000, with an initial staffing level&#13;
of 5. A sum (initially US$10,000 in 1995 prices) is included to cover the cost of transport, materials and&#13;
voice communications. It is assumed that staffing and other requirements will increase at an annual rate&#13;
of 20% as transaction volumes, the number of participants, and the real-time gross settlement component&#13;
of the system increase. Estimates for both business and IT operations assume the availability of&#13;
appropriately skilled local resources going forward.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
130                                  Annex 11&#13;
Telecommunications Costs&#13;
9.            The main on-going operating costs are data communications costs relating to the&#13;
transmission of payments across the VNPT/VDC network from 1997. These costs must be estimated&#13;
with reference to projected volumes and an indicative unit message cost. Pending negotiations with&#13;
VNPT/VDC to establish these message unit costs, telecommunications costs have not been taken into&#13;
account in determining the break-even prices. However, the model has been designed to incorporate&#13;
these costs as and when they become available.&#13;
Action - Indicative Data Communications Charge&#13;
SBV should obtain from VNPT/VDC an estimate of a 'bundled' charge, reflecting&#13;
the number and type (X.25/X.28) of lines used&#13;
the number of payment messages across the VDC X.25 network&#13;
network management services.&#13;
This charge should take into account all payments trafric (intra-bank as well as inter-bank). Inter-&#13;
bank volumes should be multiplied by 4 (reflecting a 1:4 inter-bank:intra-bank ratio) to provide a&#13;
rough estimate of all trafric.&#13;
The line requirements set out in part 6 of the Statement of User Requirements (Tables 6.1 and 6.2) allow&#13;
for total payment volumes of up to about 300,000 payments per day (see project files).&#13;
Break-Even Prices&#13;
10.          For a given year and a given volume scenario, there is a break-even price at which the&#13;
stream of revenues is equal to the stream of costs. The break-even price for a given year Y is calculated&#13;
as follows:&#13;
sum of total annual costs incurred (1995-Y)/sum of projected volumes (1997-Y)&#13;
The sum of costs includes an estimate of the sum of commitment fees and service charges incurred on&#13;
the IDA credit. The actual break-even point will be determined by actual volumes (hence revenues) and&#13;
actual costs, as well as by price.&#13;
NB    This is the break-even price for inter-bank clearing and settlement - not a price for end-to-&#13;
end processing of inter-bank payments. Further, this is an average break-even price, and actual&#13;
costs will vary around this average for individual transactions.&#13;
I l.         Additional operating costs (mainly in the business operations category) will be incurred&#13;
by the commercial banks in processing payments up to the point at which they enter IBPS as an&#13;
electronic payment instruction, and on receipt of electronic instructions from IBPS. These costs are&#13;
considered to be part of the normal operating costs of the commercial banks in the provision of the new&#13;
payment services.&#13;
12.          The table below shows the result of the break-even analysis under the four volume&#13;
growth scenarios. The prices do not include telecommunications costs, which can be expected to add&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
131                                   Annex 11&#13;
between US$0.10-0.60 to the per message costs. The break-even prices for a given year Y and a given&#13;
volume scenario indicate the price that must be charged from the very beginning of system operation to&#13;
achieve full cost-recovery in that year. As can be expected, the earlier full cost recovery is desired, the&#13;
higher the price that must be charged, and vice versa.&#13;

Prices&#13;
13.          Charges for inter-bank clearing and settlement should be set to recover both start-up and&#13;
operating costs. The tariff structure should differentiate between different types of transactions and levels&#13;
of service, and prices should be set so as to achieve full cost recovery in an acceptable time frame (say,&#13;
by 2000). This implies that there will be an initial subsidy to encourage use, but that this will be&#13;
recovered within the first few years of live operation of the system. After break-even (when revenues&#13;
exceed costs), a surplus will be available for further development of inter-bank payment systems. The&#13;
NPC will decide on actual pricing policy. It should avoid cross subsidization between different types of&#13;
payment: item charges should reflect differences in the cost of different items, such as real-time gross&#13;
settlement compared with net settlement. The charging policy may combine fixed membership fees with&#13;
per item charges - one way of giving discounts to high volume users.&#13;

            Viet Nam - Payment System and Bank
            Modernization Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The ultimate objective of the Bank
            System Modernization Project is to assist in the development
            of a modern banking sector able to service the needs of a
            growing economy, thereby increasing confidence in the
            Vietnamese banking system. The immediate objectives of the
            project are to: 1) improve payment services in the economy
            in order to reduce float, speed up circulation of funds and
            increase efficiency of funds transmission, while providing
            convenience and service to users; and 2) strengthen the
            institutional capabilities of participating banks in order
            to stimulate commercial bank initiatives to improve internal
            management and customer service. The project consists of
            four components: 1) a national inter-bank payment clearing
            and settlement system; 2) commercial banks' intra-bank
            payment systems; 3) commercial banks' institutional
            strengthening; and 4) project management support.
