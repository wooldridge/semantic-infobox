                 Heating are before you.              I do not know vmether there are arry comments&#13;
&#13;
                 on the .form of these minutes or on the supplementary memoranda.&#13;
&#13;
                 Very good; we shall continue Vlith that system.                Unlese I hear&#13;

                 objections, the minutes will be declared approved.&#13;

                 The next item is the matter that aros~ in connection with the&#13;
&#13;
                 consideration of a loan to Belgium for the purpose of financing a part&#13;
&#13;
                 of its iwestme.nt program and the application of the prov;i.sion8 of&#13;
&#13;
                 Article IV of the Articles of Agreement to the general situation which&#13;
&#13;
                 vras presented by ttle Belgian application._ On Ua.rch 8, the Board&#13;
&#13;
                 referred    th~s     question to the ColJII!littee pn Financial Policy.        The&#13;
&#13;
                 Committee has held three meetings and yesterday the report was&#13;
&#13;
                 circulated to you. .I do not think it is necessary for me to read that&#13;
&#13;
                 report to you,         It sets out the consensus of      th~   members of the&#13;
&#13;
                 Financial Policy Committee.             In the course of the discussion, we ran&#13;
&#13;
                 into a number of questions concerning 'What is tneant 'by            11 e;&gt;cceptio~&#13;

&#13;
                 circwnstances11 â&#128;¢       It was not clear from the      lan~uage   of the Articles&#13;
&#13;
                 themselvesÂ· am we could not get any satisfactory guidance on that&#13;
&#13;
                 problem either from the Articles themselves or the background in the&#13;
&#13;
                                                                 a t Bretton Woods .&#13;
                 form of minutes of diQcussions which took place .&#13;
&#13;
                 Some light was thrown on it but , after some rather thorough diScussion&#13;
&#13;
                 of the subject, we ciecided that this report embodied our thinking on&#13;
&#13;
                 the Jll!ltter 1&#13;
&#13;
                 Are there any        co~nt~    on that report?&#13;

&amp;#12; . STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:      Mr. Chairman, I understand that the suggestions in this report of the&#13;
&#13;
               Financial Policy Committee concern onl,y the problem of Rexeeptional&#13;
               circumstancesR. Â· We have omitted the other consideration which was&#13;
&#13;
               mentioned by me at the last aeeting that only a part of the loan could&#13;
&#13;
               be in local currency.     I umerstand that we cannot propose &amp;JVthing to&#13;
&#13;
               solve this question because llhat is part of the loan must obviousq be&#13;
&#13;
               un1erstood in the light of what is the entire loan, so the application&#13;
&#13;
               of the expression must wait.&#13;
&#13;
CHA.IRJIAN t   I forgot to note that Mr. Garland is with us this morning substituti.Jlg&#13;
&#13;
               for J4r. llcFarlane.   llr. Garland is Alternate in the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
               Are there &amp;r:rJ" other coJIDents on this report?&#13;
&#13;
COPETE:        14r. Chairman:   an excellent report has been made by the Finaneial Policy&#13;
&#13;
               Committee ani I welcome the clarification shown in this        report~   . As I&#13;
&#13;
               understand it, it is to serve .as . a   gener~l   guide for&#13;
                                                                        .&#13;
                                                                           local currency loans.&#13;
&#13;
               It is clear that local .currency loans can only be granted under exceptional&#13;
&#13;
               circumstances, in accordance with the terms of the Articles of Agreement,&#13;
&#13;
               but such exceptional circumstances must be subject to careful study in&#13;
&#13;
               each particular case.     If we are to understand this from the report, then&#13;
&#13;
               I would like to know why in the fourth paragraph such strong words as&#13;
&#13;
               "urgent.â&#128;¢ and "serious" are used.    They do not give flexibility in&#13;
&#13;
               dealing with particular cases.      I do not know whether in the document&#13;
&#13;
               there might not be sOJDething less extreme in that paragraph in order to&#13;
               avoid complications.&#13;
CHAIRMAN:      (reading from document)    "The need for the carrying out of the project&#13;
&#13;
               conce~ned   DlW!t be so urgent that it cannot, 'Without seriously impairing&#13;
&#13;
               the economic development of the country be postponedâ&#128;¢.         The combination&#13;
&#13;
               of â&#128;¢urgent" and "seriously" makes an impression that is rather strong.&#13;
COPETE:        Very few projects could not be postponed.         We should use other words.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 1791 -&#13;
&amp;#12;â&#128;¢   STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
    BARANSKI :     Mr . Chairman, in this respect, "without :iiupairing" rather seems&#13;
&#13;
                   sufficient without the word "seriously". Vie could omit that and&#13;
&#13;
                   stick to "urgent" .    lihat is urgent we do not know and we have used&#13;
                   "without serious impairment of the econoiey"11 as an expression of 1'lhat&#13;
&#13;
                   we mean by the word "urgent" .      I would prefer to omit   "ur~ent"   and&#13;
                   stick to the other word.      Alternatively we might substitute "of S'..lCh&#13;
&#13;
                   a nature" .for "urgent" .&#13;
&#13;
    CHAIRliAN:     Perhaps that will do .&#13;
&#13;
    BARANSKI:      Mr. Chairman, there is one point I would like to make in connection&#13;
&#13;
                   with the memorandum.     The ltlole stu::ly is made on the basis of a loan&#13;
&#13;
                   directly by the Bank.       In the case where the borrower receives     a loan&#13;
                   to be guaranteed by the Bank, it might be interesting to stOO;y that&#13;
                   phase of the problem.&#13;
&#13;
    CllAIID:IAN:   The provision does not apply in the case of guarantees.        That is&#13;
&#13;
                   another avenue of approach .      I think we can accept thia report of the&#13;
&#13;
                   Financial Policy Committee with that change .       I assume that no Members&#13;
&#13;
                   of the Fin.a.ncial Policy Committee here object to the change     w~ch&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   has been suggested.&#13;
&#13;
    GARLAND:       l.ir. Chairman, there were one or two matters of princip;l.e which&#13;
&#13;
                   troubled me in considering this memorandum.       On page 3, in the second&#13;
                   paragraph, you state tnat the requirement relates to the econor..ic&#13;
&#13;
                   justification for borrowing foreign exchange to finance local currency&#13;
&#13;
                   expenditures on the project.       It seems to me the economic justification&#13;
                   for borrowing foreign exchange cannot be very great in the case of a&#13;
&#13;
                   CO\Ultry with fairly adequate reserves of foreign exchange .      lâ&#128;¢e are&#13;
&#13;
                   dealing in the case of the Bank uith dollar assets, with resources&#13;
&#13;
                   that are scarce and that are urgently required by other member&#13;
&#13;
                   countries .   It seems to me that we are   ~   can we say - rather&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 1792 ...&#13;
&amp;#12;       .&#13;
  , STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
GARLAND:      dissipating our scarcÂ·e resources in allowing them to be given to a&#13;
(Contâ&#128;¢d)&#13;
              country which is not in urgent need of them.          That conclusion on my part&#13;
&#13;
              is reinforced by considering that in this case it         i~   surely possible for&#13;
&#13;
              Belgium to get   ~er   local currency needs from local markets.        It is true&#13;
&#13;
              that there are   restrict~ons,   legal restrictions and policy restrictions,&#13;
&#13;
              etc., which will make it difficult for her to raise a loan, but it does&#13;
              seem to me that it is within her own power to ta\(e measures which 1fi.ll&#13;
&#13;
              enable her to raise the loan locally.        Moreover, some unemployment is&#13;
&#13;
              developing there.      Perhaps we might grant our services -u, assist in that&#13;
              i f on study of conditions in Belgium there is a prima facie indication&#13;
&#13;
              that some relaxation of local restrictions might be effective in making&#13;
&#13;
              necessary currency available. That is the second point I wanted to raise â&#128;¢&#13;
                               â&#128;¢&#13;
CHAIRlU.N t   Although this subject arose as a rerult or an application from Belgium,&#13;
&#13;
              we detennined in the course of discussion in the Financial Policy Com-&#13;
&#13;
              mittee that we would like the report on a general rather than a particular&#13;
&#13;
              basis.   The thought was that we would send some people over to Belgiua&#13;
                                                    .                               .&#13;
              to take a look at the whole situation to detennine whether any â&#128;¢exceptional&#13;
&#13;
              circumstances" existed in :that particular application, and that the Com-&#13;
&#13;
              mittee report would be guidance to them when they reported back to the&#13;
&#13;
              Bank.    The ccnsiderations that we have put forward were discussed in&#13;
              the Financial Policy Comniittee.     I think that the condition of the local&#13;
              market and the possibilities or raising money there would certainly be&#13;
&#13;
              among the elements which would be examined by the group that went over&#13;
&#13;
              there before any determination were made in connection with this&#13;
&#13;
              particular application.&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:     I think the matter is fully covered by point      5   in the report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 179.3 -&#13;
&amp;#12;       STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
    CHA.IRMA.Nt      The matter was fully discussed ard is, I think, covered in the report.&#13;
&#13;
    CHANG:           I am not quite clear as to what decisions were made on llr. Baranski 1 s&#13;
&#13;
                     point.&#13;
&#13;
    CHAIRJaN:        He raised the point that there was not ver,r much use talking about the&#13;
&#13;
                     lll9aning or â&#128;¢part or the loan" until we have the specific application to&#13;
&#13;
                     deal with.   A.t that point we might consider what is meant b.T â&#128;¢part of&#13;
&#13;
                     the loanâ&#128;¢ in the .Articles, but discussion or that point did not seem to&#13;
&#13;
                     be appropriate to the general report of the Financial Policy Collllrl.ttee.&#13;
                               .                                                            .&#13;
&#13;
    CHANG a          As a matter of principle is the Bank prepared to give a loan      entire~       Â·&#13;
&#13;
                     or local currency, that is what I mean by" 11part of the loanâ&#128;¢?&#13;
&#13;
    CHAIRKAll:       When we have a particular application, we will have to face the question&#13;
&#13;
                     whether we are prepared to deal with the entire need or onl.7 a part of&#13;
&#13;
                     it.   I do not know whether we need to cross that bridge until we come&#13;
&#13;
                     to it.    At that point, if the suggestion is made to finance the whole&#13;
&#13;
                     need, we will haTe to consider what is meant by that provision.            I am&#13;
&#13;
                     suggesting that we do not now decide that question,_ and certainly not&#13;
&#13;
                     in ~onnection with Belgiua until we know_what the situation is.&#13;
&#13;
     )[cFA.RLANE:    'MB.y I say a few words?   Do I understand the Board bas approved this&#13;
(who came in a few&#13;
 moments before. )   document?&#13;
    CHAIRMAN:        No.   We are just discussing it, and I am asking for other comments .&#13;
&#13;
    KcFA.RLANE~      I feel that it involTes an exceedingly important principle to adopt&#13;
&#13;
                     the   policy o! using foreigilmoney- for local internal pruposes.      ODce&#13;
&#13;
                     you open the gate, the difficulty ie _to refuse other similar requests .&#13;
&#13;
                     The document as presented permits of avenues here and there, and there&#13;
&#13;
                     will be the q.1estion of interpretation of   ~ost   of these points.       In&#13;
&#13;
                     the case of even Britain, I would say that the last 'c lause of your&#13;

&#13;
llcFARUNEt    document 1roul.d permit interpretation that a dollar loan to Britain&#13;
(Cont d)&#13;
     1&#13;
              was feasible.      I thi.Jlk that would be a great mistake, because a&#13;
&#13;
              count.r:y that has reached the stage of deTelopment that Brita.in has&#13;

              reached should never have access to a scarce currenc.y like dollars&#13;
&#13;
              for an internal. loan.&#13;
CHAIRMAN:     Britain has done it.&#13;
&#13;
:UcFARLANE:   No, not for internal speMing surely; for external disabilities, not&#13;
&#13;
              internal spending.     Especially if she had overseas resources I would&#13;
&#13;
              hope, andÂ· I am sure that Sir Gordon would agree, that she 1110uld never&#13;
&#13;
              make such a loan.      There   a~   two points I think that should guide our&#13;
&#13;
              judgements.      Dollars are scarce, more than they have ever been, and&#13;
&#13;
              it is likely tbat they will become scarcer.           We have to   safegll&amp;~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              dollars for capital equipment froc the      u.s.      Just as you screened&#13;
&#13;
              lend-lease, and as you are screening E.C.A., I suggest that it is not an&#13;
&#13;
              umril!le policy for this Board to screen its doll.ar resources.          When it&#13;
&#13;
              gets access to five or six currencies, then there will be llllch more&#13;
&#13;
              freedom.      Approaching it from a practical point of vieY, to        -v 1ra7&#13;
              of thinldng, the countries to which attention should be particularly'&#13;
&#13;
              given are the countries lfhich have a lot of undeTeloped res ourees, like&#13;
&#13;
              .South America ani possibly South J.frica, and Yhich have not got the&#13;
&#13;
              labor to develop all the ney resources.           Such countries need foreign&#13;
&#13;
              currenc7 for development; there are man;y countries that have gone through&#13;
&#13;
              that stage, a1d none more typical than Canada and Australia.             In the&#13;
&#13;
              case of Australia,. we had six separate Governments all of whom borrowed,&#13;
&#13;
              in the 90's am after, to build railways,       ~-electric          projects, and&#13;
&#13;
              other projects to develop the countr,r.      ~f   they had not done so, Australia&#13;
&#13;
              would now probabq be occupied by the Japs; but that stage bas passed,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 179$ -&#13;
&amp;#12;  STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McFARLANE:    and now Australia would never dream. of borrowing overseas for internal&#13;
(Cont'd)&#13;
              spending.   I   o~   present this to the Board to give an example of a&#13;
&#13;
              principle that is worth some consideration.&#13;
SUNDARESAN:   I thought the memorandum. said that each case would be judged on its&#13;
&#13;
              merits when the time came that specific eases were before us.&#13;
&#13;
              W'e are not passing an;r loan applieati on b;r this document.     It was&#13;
&#13;
              considered in order to clear our own thinking on this matter of the&#13;
&#13;
              use of foreign exchange for local currency purposes.         I thi:Dk that it&#13;
&#13;
              did sharpen our thinking on it, and certainly the Board 1li 11 have ample&#13;
              opportunity to consider an;y reports that are made in respect of a:ey&#13;
&#13;
              country in the light of tbe policy 'Which is set out in this pcper.&#13;
&#13;
              "Exceptional circumstances" are something provided in the Articles and&#13;
&#13;
              we do not have a yardstick for the use of foreign exchange for local&#13;
&#13;
              currency purposes.      It is express:cy stated that we might, and it has&#13;
&#13;
              been indicated that in the case ot a guarantee the application of&#13;
&#13;
              exceptional circumstances is not made.         I think that the Board is&#13;
&#13;
              certainly .tree from a legal point of view to make a loan for these&#13;
&#13;
              purposes.   Whether   1re   want to do it in any case depends on ldlat we&#13;
&#13;
              think of the particular circumstances in the case.&#13;
&#13;
McFARLANE;    There is just one point.        I think it is a bit untair to BelgiWB to send&#13;
&#13;
              a mission over when you are not clear as to policy first.        It might be&#13;
              an embarrassment if, a.rter spending five or six months, you have to&#13;
&#13;
              come back and say perhaps that you could not consider this loan.&#13;
&#13;
              Another point - it may be that in the expeM:iture Belgi.llll wants to&#13;
&#13;
              umertake, there will be direct demands on dollar currency.          They may&#13;
&#13;
              be met out of a smaller loan 'Whose purposes would be dollar needs, or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  - 1796 -&#13;
&amp;#12;      .&#13;
   STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
llcFA.RLANE:   dollar purchases for particular purposes as part o! this internal&#13;
(Cont'd)&#13;
               development.    I think that is well worth coll81deration.     You mentioned&#13;
&#13;
               the other day that you were goi.Dg to check the elld-use o! local&#13;
&#13;
               currency expenditures.      That still leavezr aâ&#128;¢bl.incP date and "blindâ&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
               purposes for the dollars, which I think is bad in principle.            These&#13;
&#13;
               are a few of the points that ought to be considered, not because of&#13;
&#13;
               Belgiua but because it is a typical illustration of ldlat is going to&#13;
&#13;
               govern similar cases.&#13;
&#13;
BASIN:         In connection with J4r. JlcFarlane's first point, I would like to ask&#13;
&#13;
               this question; when it. comes     to dollars to import American g:&gt;ods,&#13;
               what does the country do With the counterpart when the dollars are sold.&#13;
&#13;
KcFA.RLANEz    I   am afraid I did not get the question.&#13;
BASYNz         It' a country borrows dollars to illport goods from the U.S., the counter-&#13;
&#13;
               part of the loan when the things are sold in the country are used in&#13;
&#13;
               the country for internal purposes in its financing program.          When the&#13;
&#13;
               goods are sold or the foreign currency is sold, there is a counterpart&#13;
&#13;
               availAble in the country.       I believe Mr. McFarlane loses sight of the&#13;
&#13;
               fact that every loan has two aspects.&#13;
&#13;
JlcFARLANE t   'l'he point I made is that the di.rect dollar loan is different.        Dollars&#13;
&#13;
               are then used for   e~eential   purposes am for direct application to&#13;
&#13;
               development in the countr.y concerned.       Here you propose to use dollars&#13;
&#13;
               for local finance and thereb,y leave the actual dollars available to be&#13;
&#13;
               used for some future unknown purpose.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN a     As to whether we should send &amp;llyone over to take a look at the&#13;
&#13;
               Belgian scene, it seams to be rather difficult tor us not to&#13;
&#13;
               respond to their request that we do so.        I think there are things we&#13;
&#13;
               ought to know about tbe Belgian situation before we can      realq&#13;
               discuss it.    I think we ought to make it perfect.ly clear,   am   I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 1797 -&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
CHAIIWAN:     believe the Belgians have it clearly in mind, that by sending a&#13;
(Cont'd)&#13;
              mission we do not necessarily mean that a loan is going to be forth-&#13;
              coming.     I think there is no misunderstanding on that and no&#13;
&#13;
              embarrassment, unless we want to sit dom now in the light of what&#13;
&#13;
              we know and decide not to consider even this step but it                  s~ems    to&#13;
&#13;
              me this is the more sensible way to proceed.                  There are all sorts of&#13;
&#13;
              things that can be looked into, in considering vhat the                  ter~     and&#13;
&#13;
              possibilities of this loan might be.              Suppose we found that Belgium&#13;
              could buy some equipment locally or in               so~e   way raise a large part&#13;
&#13;
              of tbe loan through its own efforts, might we not then be influenced&#13;
&#13;
              to assist them over the final hump? Suppose they could negotiate&#13;
              this loan on the side, and question of currency was presented to us .&#13;
&#13;
              Suppose we found the condition of the local market such in Belgium&#13;
&#13;
              that it was impossible to raise the money locally.                  Then we would have&#13;
&#13;
              to face that situation to see        ~ether       or not under such circumstances&#13;
&#13;
              it was    ~dvisable   for us 'to make a loan.            \ie might even consider&#13;
&#13;
              whether taxation was      possibl~.        \ie might perhaps have a double barrel&#13;
&#13;
              check on that.&#13;
&#13;
McFARLANE :   Yes â&#128;¢&#13;
BASYN:        l4\Y I just say that this    Yfauld only be a supplement to in~rnal&#13;
&#13;
              financing to be done by Belgium.            As   l.!r~   Spaak told, you, th;l Belgian&#13;
&#13;
              Government has tapped the market for 3 b~llion 5 for reconstruction,&#13;
              1 billion for railroads and       2,5 billion for other projects . They&#13;
              also plan aÂ· loan of     5 to 6 Â·billion     before the summer.         I wo'Uld like&#13;
&#13;
              to bring tllat to t,pe attention of the aoard.&#13;
&#13;
CHA:rm1AN :   Are there any other comments?         If not , may I consider the report of&#13;
&#13;
              the Financial Policy Committee as approved b.Y the Board, subject to&#13;
&#13;
              the canments v1hich have been made at this meet;i.ng.               Do .I hear a&#13;
