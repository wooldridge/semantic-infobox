                          OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS HElJ) IN THE&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:     Will the meeting please come to order.&#13;
(Garner)&#13;
              This is our first trial of this new seating arrangement.     I trust that it&#13;
&#13;
              will prove to be satisfactory.    We \'Till try it a few weeks and see.&#13;
&#13;
TANSLEY:      There appears to be more room.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:     The first item is approval of the minutes of the 19Sth meeting.       You have&#13;
&#13;
              had the minutes.   Are there any comments or corrections?     If not, they will&#13;
&#13;
               stand approved.&#13;
&#13;
              The Treasurer's Department, working with the Committee on Foreign Banking,&#13;
               representing leading commercial banks in the United states, has worked out&#13;
&#13;
               an arrangement regarding the issue of agreements on letters or credit in&#13;
&#13;
               connection with our loan disbursements.     You have had a copy of this&#13;
               procedure and a draft resolution.     Are there any questions regarding it?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPENOl':     I am quite agreeable to that paper.     There is only one question I wanted&#13;
&#13;
               to ask.   Would it be possible - I do not see any precise case where it&#13;
&#13;
               should be done now - lfOuld it be possible to extenl that same procedure&#13;
&#13;
               of letters of credit to people who sell the material themselves?      Suppose,&#13;
               for instance, that the borrower has a very large amount to buy from a&#13;
&#13;
               particular business, would it be possible for the Bank to give this same&#13;
&#13;
               guarantee to this firm?   The people who furnish that material may have&#13;
&#13;
               credi t of tileir own but do not want to go to the bank and can ask the&#13;
&#13;
               International Bank to extern to them the same kind of credit; would that&#13;
&#13;
               be possible?&#13;
 ,)WERS:       Yes, it is perfectly possible and I believe in one or two cases the&#13;
&#13;
               Treasurer's Department has worked out such an arrangement.     We   have not&#13;
&#13;
               had many requests for it.   I think Mr. Crena de Iongh would k:now more about&#13;
               that.&#13;
                                               - 2242 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
r   'NA DE&#13;
    ~ONGH:   I do not see any objections,    Mr.   Chairman.    Of cour?e, the request has to&#13;
             come from the borrower.      In case of guarantees, I do not see any objections.&#13;
             In case of cash collateral, there might be a question whether the borrower&#13;
&#13;
             wanted to make a deposit not with a bank but with private individuals.&#13;
&#13;
             However, I think if the borrower would think the recipient would be&#13;
&#13;
             creditworthy, I do not see why this system should not work just as well for&#13;
&#13;
             a bank as well as for a business firm or an industry.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:    You were   t~ng   about guarantees, not depositing cash?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPENOT :   No, no, guarantees.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:    Vie could do that.&#13;
&#13;
             Are there any other questions?&#13;
TANSLEY:     I would certainly agree and express same surprise that up to now it has&#13;
&#13;
             been necessary to deposit collateral.&#13;
CRENA DE&#13;
    IONGH:   I do not understand.&#13;
GARNER:      Mr. Tansley expresses surprise we had        to deposit collateral.&#13;
CRENA DE     The collateral procedure was worked out at the time with the banks.           Only&#13;
    IONGH:&#13;
             in the case of the Finnish Loan where we felt it might be cheaper and better&#13;
&#13;
             we took the initiative to introduce the system of guaranties.&#13;
SOWERS:      We might add that under the commitment charge policy, before it was changed,&#13;
&#13;
             it did not make the same difference to our borrowers that it does now.&#13;
CHAIRMAN:    No further questions?     Do I hear a motion?       (Moved and Second.ed)   All in&#13;
&#13;
             favor, please Bay II Aye".    Contrary mi.n:led,   "No". It is so ordered.&#13;
             It has seemed to us that it would be useful for the information of the&#13;
&#13;
             Directors to ask the Treasurer to outline briefly the procedure followed&#13;
&#13;
              in cormection with end-use supervision of our loans.         In general, you know&#13;
&#13;
             the procedure, but we thought it would be helpful to have him give a little&#13;
&#13;
             more specific description of just how the Bank operates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 2243 -&#13;
&amp;#12;CRENA DE&#13;
  IONGH:   Mr. Chairman, I think I should start by pointing out that the procedure of&#13;
&#13;
           our end-use supervision for the general purpose loans is rather different&#13;
&#13;
           from the procedure we follow in the project loans.        In the general purpose&#13;
&#13;
           loans, we check on the disbursements, whether they tally with the program,&#13;
&#13;
           and then follow through the goods until they came into the country, and&#13;
&#13;
           whether they were used for the purposes we expected.       The disbursements,&#13;
&#13;
           as you know, of all the general purposes loans are canpleted with a small&#13;
&#13;
           exception for Luxembourg.   The end-use supervision is completed in France&#13;
&#13;
           am Hollani, ani in the Danish case J i t will be completed we think, around&#13;
&#13;
           :March of next year.   I do not think I need to elaborate on this point any&#13;
&#13;
           more.&#13;
&#13;
           How the end-use supervision of the project loans is more complicated.       It&#13;
&#13;
           is the purpose of the Bank not only to see to it that, as in the general&#13;
&#13;
           purpose loans, goods actually arrive in the country, but that the project&#13;
&#13;
           is completed.   The Bank wants to know that when our money has been disbursed&#13;
&#13;
           and the goods have arrived, the project is executed as antiCipated.       It is&#13;
&#13;
           clear that the Bank is not only interested in the use of specific goods it&#13;
&#13;
           finances, but in the whole project in itself, ani, therefore, in many cases,&#13;
&#13;
           in the availability of local currency for the completion of the project.&#13;
&#13;
           In many cases, the aoount of local currency is much bigger than the amount&#13;
&#13;
           of foreign exchange which the Bank provides; therefore, we had to follow&#13;
&#13;
           through the use of the local currency also and see that the local currency&#13;
&#13;
           is actually available.    Of course, we cannot demand that all the local&#13;
&#13;
           currency a project requires (as in the Brazilian Traction case, up to five&#13;
&#13;
           years) will be available the moment the loan is signed, but we have to be&#13;
&#13;
            sure that the local currency is forthcoming, either from the budget of a&#13;
&#13;
            country or from "the income of a company.      The Treasurerts Department checks&#13;
&#13;
            on all these things through accounting and engineering procedures.       Before&#13;
&#13;
            a loan is signed, we ask the prospective borrowers whether they can furnish&#13;
&#13;
                                              _ ??I.1. _&#13;
&amp;#12;rBENA DE&#13;
  IONGH:    us with what is called Progress Reports; we have to follow through at the&#13;
,Cont Id)&#13;
            moment we are certain part of the project should be completed, that it&#13;
&#13;
            actually has been completed.      An engineer has been attached to the Treasurer1s&#13;
&#13;
            staff, and is already working on these projects.&#13;
&#13;
            We have a number of signed loans on which As yet nothing has been disbursed.&#13;
&#13;
            These are the two loans to India, the loan to Colombia, the loan to the&#13;
&#13;
            Herstelbank ani the loan to Finland, am both the timber loans to Finlam.&#13;
&#13;
            and Yugoslavia.     We have been in contact wi th all these countries, ani I&#13;
&#13;
            think that their progress reports will be coming forth regularly.         We have&#13;
&#13;
            a number of active project loans such as in Brazil; the       Brazi~ian   Traction&#13;
&#13;
            Company furnishes us with their reports.        We are following through on the&#13;
&#13;
            telephone system, on the electrical transmission system and in the&#13;
&#13;
            construction for hydro-electric power.      Of course, in such big projects,&#13;
&#13;
            nothing runs exactly to schedule.      If an official of the company comes to&#13;
&#13;
            us ani asks for changes, we discuss them with the Loan Department, and i f&#13;
&#13;
            the changes are not very important ani do not deviate from the project as&#13;
&#13;
            such, then we of course agree.      Sometimes there are some delays in the&#13;
&#13;
            program as scbeduled, but up to now, the BraziJ.,ian Traction business BeemB&#13;
&#13;
            to b,e going   well~   although there are signs that a local currency problem&#13;
&#13;
            may arise.     In the Chilean Agricultural Machinery project, we are following&#13;
&#13;
            through on the sale of the agricultural machinery, the counter value of which&#13;
&#13;
            will be deposited in the balances of the Fomento.        Up to now, the amount&#13;
&#13;
             forthcoming has not been the total value of the agricultural machinery,&#13;
&#13;
             because part of it was sold on credit.      However, we are getting regular&#13;
&#13;
             reports.    We are rather concerned about the local currency methods in&#13;
&#13;
             Chile.     It is probable that one of the staff members of the Loan Department,&#13;
&#13;
             and I think one of my men will go to Chile to look into the question because&#13;
&#13;
             the reports are not coming in as regularly as expected, although we have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 2245 -&#13;
&amp;#12;CRENA DE&#13;
  IONGH:     reports which cover periods up to May, and some of them up to September of&#13;
(Cont'd)&#13;
             this year.&#13;
&#13;
             As to Mexico, Mr. Chairman, the Board knows that Mr. Iliff is in Mexico at&#13;
&#13;
             present to discuss local currency problems which have arisen during this&#13;
&#13;
             first period of supervision.&#13;
&#13;
             With regard to Belgium, we have three projects there, the Linalux Project,&#13;
&#13;
             the Ferblatil Project and the Ougree-Marihaye Project.     We get very&#13;
&#13;
             satisfactory Progress Reports, and the works are being executed on schedule,&#13;
&#13;
             although in the case of the Ferblatil Project the company has not all the&#13;
&#13;
             local exchange necessary at present am is emeavouring - and I think they&#13;
&#13;
             will succeed - to get the local exchange necessary to complete the project.&#13;
&#13;
             I think Mr. Chairman, that that is all I have to say, but I shall be very&#13;
&#13;
             glad to elaborate furtrer on al'\V point i f anyone desires.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:    I think that is a good report of our procedure_     Are there any questions?&#13;
&#13;
             I would like to ask a few questions, or rather give examples, of what is&#13;
&#13;
             in IllY" mind.   Taking as a basis three or four contracts; the first Dutch&#13;
&#13;
             country shipping loan provides for a number of datas which we find in&#13;
&#13;
             Schedule B am in Article VIII; it is said that the borrower shall furnish&#13;
&#13;
             the Bank with statements of the earnings of the sBips.     Thus, from the general&#13;
&#13;
             shipping point of view, have you any idea of how the ships are paying their&#13;
&#13;
             way and are able to make profits to cover the loan?      Do you feel that the&#13;
&#13;
             general shipping situation is changing and that trouble may be expected in&#13;
&#13;
             earning money on these ships?&#13;
&#13;
CRENA DE     Up   to now, the voyage results of the ships have been quite satisfactory.&#13;
   IONGHs&#13;
             They have lived up to expectations.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPENCYr:   Another question I would ask, which may lead the Bank to know better on&#13;
&#13;
             future agricultural projects.      Can you tell us what is the way of lending&#13;
&#13;
              or selling the agricultural material by Fomento to the farmers?     What are&#13;
&#13;
              the terms of the instalments?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 2246 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                b.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CRENA DE&#13;
   IONGH:     I would not be able to say exactly for what periods of credit the goods are&#13;
&#13;
              sold; they are sold mostly on instalments, am that is why the amount that&#13;
              has been paid to Fomento has not reached the total value of the machinery.&#13;
&#13;
. HOPPENar:   But for general information, we do not know what kind of contract is best&#13;
&#13;
              between Fomento am the fanoors.         Would tile fanners have to pay over two&#13;
&#13;
               or tllree or four years?    Also what is the rate of interest?&#13;
&#13;
 CRENA DE&#13;
   IONGH:      I am sorry that I do not know that figure by heart.&#13;
&#13;
 CHAIRMAN:     But we do know it in tile Bank.&#13;
&#13;
 CRENA DE&#13;
   IONGH:      Yes, we get reports of the amounts.&#13;
&#13;
 HOPPENar:    'A further very minor question; in the Brazilian loan, till actual breakdown&#13;
&#13;
               of money to be spent on the different parts of the project is not given,&#13;
&#13;
               it is said that the goods which could be paid out of the project of the&#13;
&#13;
               loan shall be agreed upon from time to time in writing; is that procedure&#13;
&#13;
               being done?     For instance, is Brazil still telling the Bank that on the&#13;
&#13;
               first   25   million of the loan, so much is earmarked for telephones, so much&#13;
&#13;
               for electricity, or have they allocated the whole proceeds of the loan?&#13;
 CRENA DE      We split up every loan into various categories of goods to make sure that&#13;
    IONGH:&#13;
               the whole amount will not prove to be insufficient which might happen if&#13;
&#13;
               one category would be     excee~ed   and too little would remain for another&#13;
&#13;
               category.      We have split up the Brazilian Traction loan into three parts,&#13;
&#13;
               telephone, transmission, and electricity projects, but each part in itself&#13;
&#13;
               is split up again into categories and when Brazilian Traction comes to us&#13;
&#13;
               to make disbursements, we check with a rather detailed list to see that&#13;
&#13;
               every item comes in the right category.           Is that what you mean?&#13;
&#13;
 HOPPENaI':    Yes.    It is the same with the Indian railway loan, the description of the&#13;
&#13;
               project is extreJQ:ely summary; I know that in fact tile papers which were&#13;
&#13;
               circulated to the Board gave very detailed picture of how money was to be&#13;
&#13;
               spent, but in the contract there is no breakdown.          Will the Indian Government&#13;
&#13;
                                                      - 2247 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       (   .&#13;
HOPPENar :   give the Bank such a breakdown, partial or whole, or have they already done&#13;
(~ontld)&#13;
             so.&#13;
&#13;
CRENA DE     Yes.   We do not make any disbursements before we have the full breakdown&#13;
  IONGH:&#13;
             and we already possess information from the Indian Government in the case&#13;
&#13;
             of the railway project.&#13;
&#13;
BRESCIANI:   I feel that the answer to the question I shall put now is perhaps already&#13;
&#13;
             included in your report, and in this case I apologize; it escaped my&#13;
&#13;
             attention.    I mean the problem of local currency.   As far as I see, there&#13;
&#13;
             are two kinds of local currency, first, counterpart of loans granted by&#13;
&#13;
             the Bank in foreign currency.    For instance, the Bank grants t.o Italy a&#13;
&#13;
             loan of $10 million.    The goods will be sold to the Italian producers&#13;
&#13;
             and manufacturers aOO so the Italian Goverrunent will get the counterpart&#13;
&#13;
             in local currency, that is to say, little more, at thB present exchange rate,&#13;
&#13;
             than 6 billion lira.    My fi rst question is, does the Bank supervise the&#13;
&#13;
             use of these counterpart funds in the same way as E.C.A. does, as concerns&#13;
&#13;
             the counterpart of funds of the Marshall Aid.    Does the Bank indicate to&#13;
&#13;
             local Governments the use of these funds1    Does it from time to time&#13;
&#13;
             release funds for special purposes1&#13;
&#13;
             The second question:    counterpart funds generally will be not sufficient to&#13;
&#13;
             furnish the necessary local currency to complete the expenses for the&#13;
&#13;
             project.     Does the Bank also extend its enquiries to the seconi kind of&#13;
&#13;
             the local currency?     Does the Bank enquire into the amount of savings,&#13;
&#13;
              the probable development of savings in future years and so on?    More&#13;
&#13;
             especially am I interested to know what the Bank is doing with the counter-&#13;
&#13;
             part, and whether there is a control or not.&#13;
CRENA DE      You are perfectly right in saying that the function of the local currency&#13;
   IomHz&#13;
              is in one case very different from the other one.    What I pointed out was&#13;
&#13;
              that the country has to furnish local currency to complete the project.&#13;
&#13;
              We, therefore, have to make very sure when we sign the loan contract, that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             - 2248 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        o.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CRENA DE&#13;
 TONGH:      it can be expected that local currency will be forthcoming from the economy&#13;
  mttd)&#13;
             of the country; from savings may be, by issuing bonds, or by paying it&#13;
&#13;
             themselves; the object being to complete the project.    I think that is&#13;
&#13;
             clear?&#13;
&#13;
BRESCIANI:   Yes.&#13;
&#13;
CRENA DE     The other local currency counterpart funds is a very different question.&#13;
  IONGH:&#13;
             That local currency is created out of the sale of goods which the Bank&#13;
&#13;
             imports.   You will have noticed from the contracts that this happens only&#13;
&#13;
             in two cases, in the Chilean loan where we sell agricultural machinery, and&#13;
&#13;
             it will also be the case in the Colombian loan.    The Treasurer I s Office&#13;
&#13;
             checks on the payments on the basis of the conditions of the loan.     I&#13;
&#13;
             think the policy of counterpart funds is a very different matter, and I&#13;
&#13;
             would rather ask you to direct your question to the Chairman on that point.&#13;
&#13;
             The Treasurer's Office checks on these things, and I think the discussion&#13;
&#13;
             of the policy of the counterpart funds is a very difficult matter, and&#13;
&#13;
             varies in aspect in each specific loan.     Up to now, we have not met this&#13;
&#13;
             problem very much.   Of course, you will understand that in a project such&#13;
&#13;
             as Brazilian Traction, it does not arise at all as the imported machinery&#13;
&#13;
             is used by the borrower himself.   It certainly arises in the case of&#13;
&#13;
             E.C.A.where imported COllSUJOOr goods are sold by respective governments;&#13;
&#13;
             in the E.C.A. case, therefore, they playa great part in the total econollJ3"&#13;
&#13;
             of a country.   In the Bank's case that part is limited.    In my opinion the&#13;
&#13;
             local currencies created by counterpart funds will also be more limited.&#13;
&#13;
             As the handling of the principle of local currency is a ma..tter of policy,&#13;
&#13;
             I think it should be discussed by the vanagement and not by me.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:    },lay I say on this point that up to now we have not put specifically in the&#13;
&#13;
             contract the specified control on any counterpart funds, but I think that&#13;
&#13;
             occasions may well arise in which it would be desirable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 2249 -&#13;
&amp;#12;TANSLEY:    Mr. Chairman, my question is, I think, rather akin to the one we have just&#13;
&#13;
            heard.   Y/e are talking about raising of local currency and I thought that&#13;
&#13;
            more than once recently we have been told it has been difficult to raise&#13;
&#13;
            the local currency.   The Mexlight one is the outstanding one.     You have&#13;
&#13;
            touched on one or two more, the Belgian an::!. the Chilean.   Is that because&#13;
&#13;
            it was just over-optimism on the part of the borrower at the time the&#13;
&#13;
            loan was taken or a rather over-optimistic assessment on the part of the&#13;
&#13;
            Bank?    I would be interested in arwthing you can say bearing on this.&#13;
&#13;
CRENA DE    Well, I did not say so.   It is always a difficult thing.     In the Belgian&#13;
  IONGH:&#13;
            case, I just mentioned it because it shows how the money market for bonds&#13;
&#13;
            plays a role in this matter.   As local currency becomes more and more a&#13;
&#13;
            matter of great importance the studies which the Bank will make on its&#13;
&#13;
            loan applications will certainly always have to be directed very specifically&#13;
&#13;
            to the question:    can a country be expected to raise sufficient local&#13;
&#13;
            currency or not?&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:   I think we might say in the Chilean case there was not any over-optimism.&#13;
&#13;
            A good part of the local currency funds have to come out of the budget&#13;
&#13;
            and what concerns us a little bit is that we have not received specific&#13;
&#13;
            information that next year's budget will provide adequate funds.       I think&#13;
&#13;
            our concern is to be sure that, and that is what we want to press, is that&#13;
&#13;
            when the budget is. prepared it will guarantee the necessary funds agreed&#13;
&#13;
            upon.    They have been seanewhat delinquent in keeping us informed.    I think&#13;
&#13;
            it is a similar situation in Mexico.    The next year' e budget is being&#13;
&#13;
            prepared an::!. we have been asking specifically to be informed as to the&#13;
&#13;
            estimates of local currency expenditures for next year and assurances that&#13;
&#13;
            they will be included.&#13;
&#13;
            Of course, in these construction projects, at the time we make a loan,&#13;
&#13;
             it is sanetimes difficult to estimate how mueh will be required in anyone&#13;
&#13;
             period and, in some cases, the construction may be pushed fOl"'W8.rd a little&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             - 2250 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        .LV.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRlIAN:    faster than estimated and they may run short.   On the other hand, there&#13;
'~ontld)&#13;
              may be delays in construction.   I do not think there is any miscalculation&#13;
&#13;
              over all, but how to have funds when needed is a problem.     We have to keep&#13;
              on top of that problem and there is no danger that the borrowers cannot&#13;
&#13;
              meet the bills.&#13;
&#13;
TAliSLEY:     Mr. Chairman, it was the Mexlight loan which bothered me the most in this&#13;
&#13;
              particular connection.   For instance, at the last meeting the Loan Director&#13;
&#13;
              was more or less compelled to tell us that only part of the necessary local&#13;
&#13;
              currency would be appropriated from the budget and the rest would have to&#13;
&#13;
              be raised by a bond issue which would amost certainly have to be taken up&#13;
&#13;
              by the Central Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKIl     I lI'ould like to come back to counterpart fund control.   When we have&#13;
&#13;
              discussed the Belgian Loan we have been informed that the Bank, generally&#13;
&#13;
              speaking, does not make the counterpart fund control.      But just after that&#13;
&#13;
              I read in press release that in the case of the Chilean loan for the&#13;
&#13;
              agricultural project a release of the local currency counterpart funds&#13;
&#13;
              by the Bank was made.    Was that a mistake in the information or really&#13;
&#13;
              something like that has happened?&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:     Can youconrnent on that, Mr. Crena de Iongh?&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:     I read in the press release that one Chilean paper mentioned that the Bank&#13;
&#13;
               released a part ofÂ· the local currency counterpart of the loan.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:     Can any member of the staff give any information on that?      Could lI'e get&#13;
&#13;
               that press release?&#13;
&#13;
HOAR:         What date was that?&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:      It was just after the Belgian Loan.    That press information just seemed to&#13;
&#13;
               be inconsistent with the information we have got during the discussion on&#13;
&#13;
               the Belgian Loan.&#13;
&#13;
HOAR:          Press release on the Belgian Loan?&#13;
&#13;
 BARANSKI I    Not a press release, the press digest of the Bank.    The press digest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 2251 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          L1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 BARANSKI:       mentioned information given by a Chilean paper which says that the&#13;
    mttd)&#13;
                 International Bank has released local currency counterpart for the general&#13;
                 use of the Chilean budget.&#13;
&#13;
. BEYEN:         Mr. Chairman, is there not some misunderstanding'!&#13;
&#13;
 CHAIRMAN:       We did not make   a~   release.&#13;
&#13;
 BEYEN:          I would like to say something on what Professor Bresciani said and then I&#13;
&#13;
                 would like to come back on the question raised by Dr. Baranski.&#13;
&#13;
                 First of all, I YlQuld like to point out that the E.C.A. position is entirely&#13;
&#13;
                 different from ours because an operation of E.C.A. creates amounts of&#13;
&#13;
                 counterpart local currencies of such magnitude that the whole monetary&#13;
&#13;
                 position of the country is influenced.       It is quite clear, not only because&#13;
&#13;
                 of the magnitude of the funds but also because of the interest of E.C.A.&#13;
&#13;
                 in the general monetary policy of til e country, that the local counterpart&#13;
&#13;
                 of E.C.A. grants am loans should be controlled some way or other because&#13;
&#13;
                 it might otherwise defeat the whole object of E.C.A. by giving a country&#13;
&#13;
                 freedom of following monetary poliCies which it otherwise could not afford.&#13;
                 In our case the counterpart problem arises only in connection with certain&#13;
&#13;
                 goods bought with our loan in the case that those goods are      8   old on by the&#13;
&#13;
                 borrower.   If the borrower keeps the goods and uses them, questions do not&#13;
&#13;
                 arise.   Except in very extra-ordinary cases where projects would be of such&#13;
&#13;
                 magnitude in relation to the whole economy of the country that local counter-&#13;
&#13;
                 part funds would really be an important factor in the whole econoIl\Y of the&#13;
&#13;
                 country, the local currency counterpart of our loans would not have great&#13;
&#13;
                  importance.&#13;
&#13;
                  On the other ham, i t is not true that we never exercise any control because&#13;
             [&#13;
                  in the use of the local currency counterpart, if I remember correctly, in&#13;
&#13;
                 both the Colombian and Chilean loans we have some control of the local&#13;
&#13;
                  counterpart â&#128;¢. It is, however, quite different from the E.C.A. control.&#13;
&#13;
                  In the Colombian case our loan is given to an institution which buys&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   - 2252 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         /d. _&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            agricultural machinery and sells it on to other people and thereby gets a&#13;
&#13;
            certain amount of local currency.     There is a provision in the Colombian&#13;
            loan, against which I raised some protest, that they could use that local&#13;
&#13;
            currency only for servicing their debt to us.      Beyond that there is a&#13;
&#13;
            certain general control on c runterpart money, as in the case of the Chilean&#13;
&#13;
            loan.     So far as I know, they need our consent to use local currency but&#13;
&#13;
            we do not look at it in connection with general economic and monetary&#13;
&#13;
            policies of the country as E.C.A. does.      We just want to know what our&#13;
&#13;
            borrower is doing with the money he is getting when he sells goods he&#13;
&#13;
            bought with money borrowed from us.&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:   To come back to the local currency counterpart control, I think it may&#13;
&#13;
            provide the criterion how various kinds of loans should be defined or&#13;
&#13;
            called.    If a firm or institution executing the project is getting the&#13;
&#13;
            loan, i.e. it is itself the debtor, that is a specific project loan.         If&#13;
&#13;
            a Goverrnnent gets a loan and sells equipment to a firm which needs it,&#13;
&#13;
            for cash, that is not a specific project loan.       Sometimes it can happen then&#13;
&#13;
            that local currency counterpart,    S6   acquired, is sterilized.   Colombian loan&#13;
&#13;
            having the provision that local currency obtained from sales of the&#13;
&#13;
            agricultural equipment should be held for the purpose of repaying the loan&#13;
&#13;
            may be considered as an example.     A loan of this kind is a balance of&#13;
&#13;
            payments loan, a pure type of a balance of payment loan.       Then the local&#13;
&#13;
            currency counterpart can be controlled in such a way that it can be released&#13;
&#13;
            for local investment purposes.      In this case, it is a combination of a&#13;
&#13;
            balance of payment loan with a local currency loan given for specific&#13;
&#13;
            local programs.    It may happen that the counterpart use is allowed for&#13;
&#13;
            general purposes of the State and then it is a combination of balance of&#13;
&#13;
            payments loan with a simple budgetary loan.       These are the various types&#13;
&#13;
             of foreign loans which can occur everywhere and of course also in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
             There are four types of loans, according to the application oÂ£ the principle&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 2253 -&#13;
&amp;#12; n~N:         The       is a commitment charge only and no interest?&#13;
&#13;
              Then when we borrow from the market, we pay 3!%.      HOlf is the Bank compensated&#13;
&#13;
              for the difference in that charge or is the Bank compensated at all?&#13;
&#13;
. CRENA DE    The difference in reality is not so very great, because in the first period,&#13;
    IONGH:&#13;
              the Bank has the money, and can invest it in short-term securities, thereby&#13;
&#13;
              earning interest.    In the second period the Bank gets the full interest but&#13;
&#13;
              the money which is not disbursed carries interest in favor of the borrower,&#13;
&#13;
              so the difference for the Bank of the first   5   i:x: months and the rest of the&#13;
&#13;
              term of the loan is not so big, but I fully agree with you that when we come&#13;
&#13;
              to a period when the Bank will have to finance out of borrowed funds, it&#13;
&#13;
              will have to manage very carefully, because margin of      i   of   1%   is extremely&#13;
&#13;
              slight.&#13;
&#13;
 ONARAN:      Thank you.&#13;

    SYN:      If the borrower is a private company, and if this private canpany has to&#13;
&#13;
              raise money in the local market, for some reason is excusable to do so,&#13;
&#13;
              can pressure be brought on the government which guaranteed the loan?&#13;
&#13;
 CRENA DE     In the case of Brazilian Light and Traction, that company could prove&#13;
   IONGH:&#13;
              that it would be able to furnish local currency out of their earnings.&#13;
&#13;
              We studied that very carefully, because there was no provision that the&#13;
              Government should furnish local currency, and it would be very difficult&#13;
&#13;
              for the company to raise money by selling its own funds locally.             As the&#13;
&#13;
              earnings are substantial local currency could always be found by cutting&#13;
&#13;
              dividends.    Unless costs reached up tremendously, we think the canpany&#13;
&#13;
              will be able to finance its local currency expenditures out of its earnings.&#13;
&#13;
  BARANSKI:    In the case of Colombia and Mexico, what is the size of the expenditure in&#13;
&#13;
               local currency, in relation to the projects?&#13;
&#13;
               Can you recall that, Mr. Crena de Iough?&#13;
&#13;
  CRENA DE     I hesitate to give any figures by heart, but i t is quite important â&#128;¢. Tn the&#13;
    IONGH:&#13;
               construction of electrical projects we have come across cases where local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 2255 -&#13;
&amp;#12;CRENA DE&#13;
  IONGH :   currency amounted to 70% of the total coati.         I   would not say that was so&#13;
\vont Id)&#13;
            much in the Mexican case.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAU:   I think I can quote the figures on Brazil.         The total project was $194&#13;
&#13;
            million and our loan was $75, so there was an equivalent of $119 in local&#13;
&#13;
            currency.       I do not recall the figures for Chile, but I     thiru~   it was at&#13;
&#13;
            least   CIJ%   local currency, and in Mexico, I think it was also in the&#13;
&#13;
            neighoorhood of      60%.&#13;
BEYEN:      Our discussion reminds me rather of the fugues of Bach, because we develop&#13;
&#13;
            two different themes at the sare time in the hope they will together produce&#13;
&#13;
            a harmonious sound,and after Mr. Onaran talked about local currency in one&#13;
&#13;
            sense I will start again to talk of it in the other sense.            I hope that&#13;
&#13;
            still somebody will know what sort of local currency we are talking about.&#13;
&#13;
            I am talking about what Mr. Bresciani is talking about.           I want to add&#13;
&#13;
            one thing to Mr. Baranski's remarks; it is of course true, i f we give a&#13;
&#13;
            general balance of payments loan or stabilization loans, that in that case&#13;
&#13;
            the local currency counterpart would give rise to considerations of general&#13;
&#13;
            monetary policies, and I agree with him that there we would find ourselves&#13;
                                                           be&#13;
            in a similar position as E.C.A.        I would/rather apprehensive, however,&#13;
&#13;
            that we adopt the principle of looking into general monetary consequences&#13;
&#13;
            before any general balance of payments loan or stabilization loans are given.&#13;
&#13;
            As the situation is now, we give only specific project loans.              In the case&#13;
&#13;
            of such loans the arising of a local currency counterpart is an accident.&#13;
&#13;
            It just depends on whether the borrower prefers to use the goods bought&#13;
&#13;
            with the proceeds of our loan himself or whether he sells them.              In the&#13;
&#13;
            latter case, the real consideration to have some influence on what the&#13;
&#13;
            borrower is doing with the local counterpart money is the following:              if&#13;
&#13;
            a man borrows money from you to buy something, then sells it and gets cash&#13;
&#13;
             for it, his creditor will naturally be interested in what he does with the&#13;
&#13;
            cash.     Let us therefore not confuse the issue.         We should be careful not&#13;
&#13;
                                                    - 2256 -&#13;
&amp;#12;    BF.YEN I      to extend our interest beyond what we are dealing with in a given case.&#13;
(       It ld)&#13;
    tHtESCIANI:   I should like that the question I put be not mis-interpreted.        I simply&#13;
&#13;
                  put the qu.estion whether the Bank exerts scme kind of c antral on expeooi ture&#13;
&#13;
                  of local currency, but I did not support that control.       On the contrary, I&#13;
&#13;
                  completely agree with Mr. Beyen, it is a very serious question whether we&#13;
&#13;
                  have to control local expenditure. In the case of E.G.A. I am quite convinced&#13;
&#13;
                  that it is very important, and also necessary enormous sums being involved,&#13;
&#13;
                  that E.G.A. exerts certain control.     I shall add that, as concerns Italy,&#13;
&#13;
                  we have experienced some inconveniences.        The counterpart funds are blocked&#13;
&#13;
                  and remain blocked for a long time.     As long as they remain blocked there is&#13;
&#13;
                  deflation; suddenly   enormous sums are released and thrown on to the market.&#13;
&#13;
                  For my part, I also would not support control of our Bank on the use of the&#13;
&#13;
                  counterpart funds.    In any case, the problem ought to be examined in all&#13;
&#13;
                  its details.   As concerning the construction of hydro-electric power stations,&#13;
&#13;
                  inquiries made in Italy have led to the result that a percentage of foreign&#13;
&#13;
                  expenditure is somewhere between    5 and   10 percent of the total cost of the&#13;
&#13;
                  project, so that more than   90%   represents expenditure which ought to be&#13;
&#13;
                  made in local currency.    This concerns hydro-electric power p1ants; in steam&#13;
&#13;
                  power plants the percentage of      local, exchange is higher, about 15-20.&#13;
&#13;
                  In any case it is a very serious problem for a country such as Italy to&#13;
&#13;
                  take a foreign loan which i t can use only for purchasing foreign goods.&#13;
&#13;
    HOPPENOT:     I would like to say a few words.      The first point is one of language.       I do&#13;
&#13;
                  not think that a too tight line should be drawn between so-called general&#13;
&#13;
                  purposes am special loans.     It is only a good way of express ing ones&#13;
&#13;
                  thouf11ts.   To take a few examples, are the French ships in general, and the&#13;
&#13;
                  Dutch ships specific?     Are the French locomotives general and Indian&#13;
&#13;
                  locomotives specific?     I think the Bank has been very wise not to make that&#13;
&#13;
                   question one of policy because it has been very difficult to define.&#13;
&#13;
                   My second point is on the difference of E.G.A. policy am policy of lending&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       - 2257 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                      17.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
HOPPENar :      institution like the Bank, as to counterpart funds; it is an important&#13;
 'ont 'd)&#13;
                point for E.C.A. policy first, as Mr. Deyen so ably stated, because of&#13;
&#13;
                the importance of the sums involved but also because E.C.A. makes grants&#13;
&#13;
                which means that the proceeds of the sale of goods furnished by E.G.A.&#13;
&#13;
                are entirely free am stay in the country.    A lending institution like the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank some day or other gets back its money in interest and amortization&#13;
&#13;
                which in fact makes larger sums than the primary cost of the goods&#13;
&#13;
                provided for on the loan.&#13;
&#13;
CHANG:          While we have the question of local currency, I would like to ask a question&#13;
&#13;
                on a matter of policy, and that is that perhaps there is a tb ird kind of&#13;
&#13;
                local currency.   I remember the Board discussing at one time the urrlesirabilit;)&#13;
&#13;
                of granting loans in local currency.   I wonder whether the Bank has studied&#13;
&#13;
                the question further, am whether the Financial Policy Cormnittee has gone&#13;
&#13;
                into the matter further.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:       We have had problems up, and you know the question of establishing&#13;
&#13;
                "extraordinary ciryumstarees" is a rather difficult one.    It is important&#13;
&#13;
                the circumstances be considered and discussed very broadly, but we are&#13;
&#13;
                bound by the restrictions in the Articles that you have to establish&#13;
&#13;
                extraordinary circumstances.   We have not yet founi conditions where we felt&#13;
&#13;
                that this existed.&#13;
&#13;
CHANG:          In other words, there has been no decision reached as to a definite policy&#13;
&#13;
                of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:       The policy of the Bank is laid down in the Articles, and we can only lend&#13;
&#13;
                local currency under extraordinary circumstances.    The policy ww1d be,&#13;
&#13;
                i f we see a case that rates that kind of extraordinary circumstances, then&#13;
&#13;
                we should look at it â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
  .t.RANSKl :   We have discussed this matter a1 ready; the memoramum prepared by the&#13;
&#13;
                Financial Policy Committee am approved by the Board concerning this policy&#13;
&#13;
                 is so far I understand still ruling our actions.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            HS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
r,HAIRMAN :   Thank you; this discussion has been helpful.&#13;
&#13;
              I would like to ask Mr. Boar to report briefly on the loan situation.&#13;
&#13;
HOAR:         I have just two matters which I thought worth mentioning.&#13;
&#13;
              The first concerns EL SALVADOR.   As the Executive Directors are aware, we&#13;
&#13;
              had thought during the last few weeks that we would be able to move very&#13;
&#13;
              quickly with El Salvador and, in preparation for that, we had already&#13;
&#13;
              furnished the Executive Directors with the economic report on the country,&#13;
&#13;
              the report on the Rio Lempa project, draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements,&#13;
&#13;
              and even a draft of the President's recoImBendations.    Indeed, at the time&#13;
&#13;
              Mr. Iliff made his last report, it was expected that the loan proposal would&#13;
&#13;
              very quickly be submitted to the Executive Directors for their final&#13;
&#13;
              consideration.   Since then, however, we have heard we shall not be able&#13;
&#13;
              to proceed quite as quickly as we had hoped.&#13;
&#13;
              We have been informed from El Salvador that the Council of Government and&#13;
&#13;
              the Cabinet have agreed on the basic conditions of the loan and have approved&#13;
&#13;
              in principle the draft agreeroonts.   In view, however, of the magnitude of&#13;
&#13;
              the transaction in relation to the size of the country, the Government is&#13;
&#13;
              anxious to have the opinion of as broad a cross-section of the public and&#13;
&#13;
              buSiness community as pOSSible, not in respect to the principle of the&#13;
&#13;
              project but on the question of the commitments' the Government is expected&#13;
&#13;
              to make on behalf of the people of El salvador.     They have set up an A.d&#13;
&#13;
              Hoc Committee for the purpose of studying the draft Loan and Guarantee&#13;
&#13;
              Agreeroonts aDi of advising the Government on them.     This Committee will&#13;
&#13;
              be uDier the chairmanship of the Undersecretary of Economy and will consist&#13;
&#13;
               of the President of the Rio Lempa    Conmlission, the President of the Court&#13;
&#13;
              of Accounts and six other members who will be selected by the lfinister of&#13;
&#13;
              Economy including two lawyers, one civil engineer and three persons chosen&#13;
&#13;
              from banking and busioos8.&#13;
&#13;
 BARANSKI a   Will there be also representatives of the private electric power plants in&#13;
&#13;
               Salvador?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                     19.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
HOAR:        I understand not.&#13;
&#13;
             The work of the Committee is expected to take three to four weeks so that,&#13;
&#13;
             including any discussion that may arise from their recommendations, it&#13;
&#13;
             looks as though we shall not be able to lay the loan before you before&#13;
&#13;
             the end of November or the beginning of December.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN :   I think it is rather interesting to see a country take so seriously the&#13;
&#13;
             question of incurring any indebtedness.&#13;
&#13;
HOAR:        It is clear that it is not a matter of procrastination, but should be taken&#13;
&#13;
             as evidence of the seriousness with which they regard this problem and the&#13;
&#13;
             acceptance of the obligations.&#13;
&#13;
             As you will be aware from Mr. nUf's last report, Mr. Consolo of the Loan&#13;
&#13;
             Department and Mr. Waterston of the Economic Department are due to leave&#13;
&#13;
             today for a visit to Nicaragua.   On his way back, Mr. Consolo is to call in&#13;
&#13;
             in El Salvador to get an impression of the progress of the forementioned&#13;
&#13;
             Committee and to discuss aI\Y points that may have arisen in the course of&#13;
&#13;
             this work.&#13;
                                                                      will&#13;
             In the circumstances, we have asked Mr. Tucker, whom you/remember was&#13;
&#13;
             scheduled to visit El Salvador in order to advise on the local bond issue,&#13;
&#13;
             to postpone his visit until after the signing of the Agreements.&#13;
&#13;
             The other point which I would mention is that we are plarming to send a&#13;
&#13;
             Bank mission to Asia at the end of the year, visiting the Philippines,&#13;
&#13;
             Thailand aIJi India, probably in that order.&#13;
&#13;
             To take the case of the PHILIPPINES, the Executive Directors will remember&#13;
&#13;
             that aoout a year ago the Bank wrote to the Philippine Goverrunent giving&#13;
&#13;
             the Bank's views on fiscal and economic measures that appeared to be&#13;
&#13;
             necessary to support the Philippine development program and saying that,&#13;
&#13;
             in reliance upon the Philippine statement of their intention to proceed&#13;
&#13;
             with necessary measures, the Bank would be willing to enter into negotiations&#13;
&#13;
             for a loan of   $15 million for two hydro-electric projects on the Agmo River,&#13;
              in the   island of Luzon.&#13;
                                                 - 2260 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                LV.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
HOAR:     The technical report on the first of these projects has just been received.&#13;
( t 'd)&#13;
          The Philippine National Power Commission let us have this report last&#13;
                                                  Bank's&#13;
          week and it is now being studied by the/technical staff..          In the meantime,&#13;
&#13;
          however, the reports     ~TIich   have reached the Bank of financial and economic&#13;
&#13;
          developments in the Philippines have been disquieting.          In the   circ~tances,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          the President of the Bank has informed Mr. Cuaderno and the Philippine&#13;
&#13;
          Ambassador, in the course of the last week, that the Bank wished to have&#13;
&#13;
          another look at the situation on the        ~   ot and, accordingly, we are planning&#13;
&#13;
          to send a mission at the beginning of December.          We cannot send it earlier&#13;
&#13;
          because the Philippines are going through the turmoil of preparing for&#13;
&#13;
          the Presidential election and we will wait until things simmer dOÂ¥fl a bit.&#13;
&#13;
          However, we do hope to have an economic and financial report available&#13;
&#13;
          shortly after Christmas.&#13;
&#13;
          Then to THAILAND.      I believe Mr. Iliff has reported to you that the Thais&#13;
&#13;
          have laid before us statements of projects in which they would like the&#13;
&#13;
          Bank to be interested, involving a foreign exchange expenditure of          $33&#13;
          million for railways and $22 million for irrigation, drainage, power and&#13;
&#13;
          navigation on the Chao Phya River.         In that connection, we shall of course,&#13;
&#13;
          need to send our usual comprehensive mission.&#13;
&#13;
          Then with INDIA.       There are two loans already made, as we all know, the&#13;
&#13;
          railways loan and the Kana Grass loan, and we are actively working on the&#13;
&#13;
          third, the Bokaro Thermal Station as part of the namodar Valley scheme.&#13;
&#13;
          These pro j ects are not, of course, all those th e Indian Government would&#13;
&#13;
          like the Bank to finance am far from being a complete range of development.&#13;
&#13;
          The Bank, of course, is interested in how the development scheIIe3 am being&#13;
                       regard to                     the&#13;
          handled with/priorities of development and/provision of finance. Then&#13;
&#13;
           there is the question of the effect of the devaluation of the pound and&#13;
&#13;
           the lr:Klian rupee.    With all of these things in consideration, we felt we&#13;
&#13;
           wruld like to have a mission re\'isit India and discuss the natters with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   - 2261 -&#13;
&amp;#12;    HOAR:           those responsible.    The Indian Government has informed us that they have&#13;
(      t'd)&#13;
                    no objection.     We shall have one mission to visit all three countries,to&#13;
&#13;
                    be led by Mr. Rucinski of the Loan Department, who accompanied me on my&#13;
&#13;
                    trip to India, and who will be accompanied by Dr. Basch of the Economic&#13;
&#13;
                    Department.     There will be added to the mission such experts in economics&#13;
&#13;
                    and technical problems as may seem appropriate.    There is one other factor&#13;
&#13;
                    and that is that the Fund are sending a mission which is circumnavigating&#13;
&#13;
                    the globe and is go ing to visit, among others, both India and tbe Philippines.&#13;
&#13;
                    I am hoping to have a talk about that with Mr. Overby this afternoon in order&#13;
&#13;
                    to see the timing of these things and make what arrangements we can to see&#13;
&#13;
                    that there is a minimum of inconvenience to the countries.&#13;
&#13;
    CHAIRJ.AAN :    Any questions'l&#13;
&#13;
    HOOKER:         May I ask about Uruguay.&#13;
&#13;
       lli:         Uruguay is moving along very rapidly and satisfactorily.     I cannot give you&#13;
&#13;
                    a date.   The Staff Loan Committee is meeting this afternoon.&#13;
&#13;
    HOOKER:         Fundamentally we are awaiting Uruguay's action which I understand is&#13;
&#13;
                    causing the delay.&#13;
&#13;
    CJ-I..AIRMAN:   We were awaiting appointment of a negotiator.&#13;
&#13;
    HOAR:           It is going ahead.&#13;
&#13;
    CHAIRMAN:       I have one or two matters I wculd like to mention.&#13;
&#13;
                    You Will recall that scmetime ago Mr. Black referred the problem in certain _&#13;
&#13;
                    countries in oormection with use of the 18% currencies for administrative&#13;
&#13;
                    expenses when we send missions to those oountries.     It applies in those&#13;
&#13;
                     countries mere the rate of exchange used in making' subscriptions does not&#13;
&#13;
                    properly reflect the real buying power of the currency in the country.&#13;
&#13;
                    were   the Bank to use a member's currency for such expenses at the official&#13;
&#13;
                     rate of exchange and the costs are very high in relation to that, the&#13;
&#13;
                     expenses to the Bank are disprOpuDtionate.&#13;
&#13;
                     Just to use an extreme illustration, let us say, suppose it is paid in at&#13;
&amp;#12;the rate of one unit of local currency to the dollar am the actual true&#13;
&#13;
foreign exchange value reflects about five units to the dollar, a mission&#13;
that we would expect to cost $1,000 would cost $5,000 and thus inflate&#13;
&#13;
the Bank's expenses.&#13;
&#13;
This problem arose some time ago and, in the case of China, France, Italy,&#13;
&#13;
Mexico and Poland, we made arrangements which enabla:l us to meet this&#13;
&#13;
situation.     In those cases what was done "as that the member would purchase&#13;
&#13;
the small amounts of their 18% currency with dollars at the normal rate of&#13;
&#13;
exchange and then permit the Bank to sell those dollars at the free market&#13;
&#13;
or some other appropriate rate.    We would like to make similar arrangements&#13;
&#13;
with other member countries whenever we find that we have need for such&#13;
&#13;
disbursements and where the subscription rate differs with the actual rate&#13;
&#13;
of exchange.&#13;
&#13;
At the time of the Fourth Annual Meeting, the President requested the&#13;
&#13;
Governors of Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Lebanon,&#13;
&#13;
Paraguay and Uruguay to discuss this matter.     All the Governors, except&#13;
&#13;
those of Costa Rica and Uruguay attended, partiCipated in the discussion&#13;
&#13;
and the following day we sent memoranda to all Governors of the countries&#13;
&#13;
mentioned.     All those attending the discussion indicated their willingness&#13;
&#13;
to make the necessary arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
However, to date we have had no formal advice from any of these countries&#13;
&#13;
except Colombia, whose communication arrived yesterday' fran Mr. Toro, but&#13;
&#13;
we have not had an opportunity to examine it.     I would like the Executive&#13;
&#13;
Directors who represent the countries mentioned to follow up this matter.&#13;
&#13;
We would greatly appreciate it i f you would communicate with these&#13;
&#13;
respective Governments and ask i f they will move ahead with malting the&#13;
&#13;
arrangements which they have irrlicated willingness to work out.&#13;
&#13;
In the future there may be other countries where this situation arises&#13;
&#13;
am in this event we would take it up at this time.      We would greatly&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          L.J.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRllAN:    appreciate it i f you gentlemen concerned would assist us in this matter by&#13;
  ')nt 'd)&#13;
              following up and requesting some action.&#13;
&#13;
BARREDA-&#13;
  MOLLER:     May I ask you to say again   ~at   countries you have dealt with.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:     The countries we have dealt with already are China, France, Italy, Mexico&#13;
&#13;
              and Poland.&#13;
&#13;
BARREDA-&#13;
  MOLLER:     And the conversations we have had in the last meeting of the Governors.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:     Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Lebanon, Paraguay and Uruguay.&#13;
&#13;
BARREDA-&#13;
  MOLLER:     Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:     One question, Mr. Chairman.   Is it necessary to have such an arrangement&#13;
&#13;
              with Mexico now, because they have devalued?&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN :    They made that arrangement at the time when such a situation existed.&#13;
&#13;
              Mexico went back to the time before their devaluation â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
  ..RANSKI:   Mexico is now after devaluation and certainly has supplemented local currency&#13;
&#13;
              paid in.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:     This situation does not arise in connection with Mexico.&#13;
&#13;
BEYEN:        Have they done it?&#13;
&#13;
CRENA DE&#13;
  IONGH:      Mexico has not.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:     What are we doing in regard to that?&#13;
&#13;
CRENA DE      Of all the countries that have devalued, only Canada and Great Britain are&#13;
    IONGH:&#13;
              at present putting up more treasury bills.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:     Yes, but Mexico's devaluation occurred last summer.&#13;
&#13;
CRENA DE      lIexico paid up promptly after that devaluation.    I do not know wnether&#13;
   IONGH I&#13;
              at present the tourist rate differs from the official rate.&#13;
&#13;
BEYEN:        That does not arise in Uexico.     There is no tourist rate.&#13;
&#13;
              Mr. Chairman, I am happy to state that we have fou.n:i a fourth kim of local&#13;
&#13;
               currency. (Laughter)&#13;
&#13;
ONARAN:       May I ask about the case of Lebanon?&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAIRMAN:   Lebanon is one of the cases where we requested that arrangements be made.&#13;
&#13;
            Now these are the countries where we have had people or we are trying to&#13;
&#13;
            send people in the near future.     It only arises when we have need for local&#13;
&#13;
            expenditures but i f we wait until we send people there, there is not time&#13;
&#13;
            to work arrangements out.    We would like, therefore, to get the principle&#13;
&#13;
            established, and in these member countries, we would appreciate help.&#13;
&#13;
            There is one other matter I would like to explain for information of the&#13;
&#13;
            Directors.    We have had a few suggestions that it would be helpful i f we&#13;
&#13;
            could make arrangements for scme responsible public employees from some of&#13;
&#13;
            the umer-&lt;ieveloped countries to spend some time in the Bank, and other&#13;
&#13;
            agencies in this country, observing administration and operating practices&#13;
&#13;
            and policies.    It may be in the field of budgeting, it may be in the field&#13;
&#13;
            of tax administration, or aqy other fields in which it might be helpful for&#13;
&#13;
            some responsible people of fairly senior rank to spend some time observing&#13;
&#13;
            practices in this country.    We have been discussing it, and arrived at an&#13;
&#13;
            experimental plan to try.    We thought of bringing over a small number of&#13;
&#13;
            such people, ani give them the opportunity to work out a program whereby&#13;
&#13;
            they could get experience and observe some good administrative and&#13;
&#13;
            operating practices in public organizations.          It might be in the Federal&#13;
&#13;
            ('.overnment and perhaps more usefully in sOOte of the small governmental&#13;
&#13;
            State, Municipal or public authorities. We would like to um ertake this&#13;
&#13;
            program by using the contacts our missions have, am try to pick out two&#13;
&#13;
            or three men and try this thing out.         Our   thought is that we would be&#13;
&#13;
            prepared to pay transportation expenses am subsistence.            They would remain&#13;
&#13;
            on their Government payroll, am we would not bring them over for employment&#13;
&#13;
             in the Bank, but that they would return to their positions and be able to&#13;
&#13;
            carry back the benefit of their experience.&#13;
&#13;
CHANG:      HOlf   long would they be here?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 2265 -&#13;
&amp;#12;(:}{A IRMAN:   1 do not know.   It might vary, but it would be scmewhere between three and&#13;
    )nt Id)&#13;
               six months, depending on the problem and on the particular individual.&#13;
&#13;
               We think it should be long enough [or the man to get some real knowledge&#13;
&#13;
               and information that he can go back and cite.      As I say, this is something&#13;
&#13;
               we have to experiment with, and therefore, we thought the best way to do&#13;
&#13;
               it is just quietly, without any announcement, to see if we can pick out&#13;
&#13;
               two or three men and try it out.    Based on that experience, we could determine&#13;
&#13;
               whether a regular established program is worth carrying forward, how many&#13;
&#13;
               people we can handle, and how to do it..      We would prefer you do not pass this&#13;
&#13;
               word outside the Bank as i f it gets around we are afraid we shall get such a&#13;
&#13;
               number of applicants before we know enough to handle it.      We did want the&#13;
&#13;
               Directors to know about this experiroont, and we would be very glad to have&#13;
&#13;
               any comments or advice that any of you might have as to how to set this&#13;
&#13;
               program up.   Mr. Howell has been giving a good deal of attention to this&#13;
               for a number of months, and has consulted with a number of people in other&#13;
&#13;
               organizations that are doing similar work in the United States.       The cost&#13;
&#13;
               for this would. be small.   OUr observation has been that in a number of&#13;
&#13;
               countries the administrative problems are quite important and i f we could,&#13;
&#13;
               through this means, be effective in helping to train a small group of&#13;
&#13;
               people over a period of years, it may be a real contribution by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
               We think it would be practical only to provide for people coming to the&#13;
&#13;
               United States at this time, but as we get experience it may be p,ossible&#13;
&#13;
               and seem advisable to provide for them getting training in other countries.&#13;
&#13;
               We would like to start on this program and try it out, and after we have&#13;
&#13;
               had a little experience, then review that experience and discuss with you&#13;
&#13;
               whether or not the program is worth continuing and expaOOing, and the&#13;
&#13;
               means by which you think it can be effectively carried out.&#13;
&#13;
 HOPPENar:      I feel it is quite a good project, and the Bank should do all it can to&#13;
&#13;
                have people come here am learn the ways not only of the Bank, but of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  - 2266 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          26.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
!-J(IPPEHOT :   United States, and in time, as you say, of other countries.     I can only&#13;
   mt'd)&#13;
                approve such a program as you have set forth to us.&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:       I will say here what corresponds roughly to what I said to the International&#13;
&#13;
                Civil Service Advisory Connnittee of the United Nations, of which I am a&#13;
&#13;
                member, when United Nations started a   ~milar   action.   I told them, that&#13;
&#13;
                there is a certain danger in having people from the under-developed&#13;
&#13;
                countries come to highly developed centera to see how they work and then&#13;
&#13;
                going back and simply copying the methods.    Wonderful stories can happen&#13;
&#13;
                after.   I would say only from my own experience, that after the First&#13;
&#13;
                World War, we had many such visits am appointments of American "managerial&#13;
&#13;
                engineersll in some   badly organized enterprises in Poland, but the results&#13;
&#13;
                of their advices were immediately existent; a jump-up of the cost of the&#13;
&#13;
                enterprise, because cheap methods were simply replaced by expensive methods,&#13;
&#13;
                and nothing happened to the organization which was as bad as before.      It&#13;
&#13;
                is necessary to have first for this purpose, very intelligent people, so&#13;
&#13;
                that they could observe but not slavishly copy from their observation,&#13;
&#13;
                and also very intelligent advice to them as to what is possible to adapt&#13;
&#13;
                in their awn countries, and what is not possible.  In a country like the&#13;
                                                                                    which&#13;
                United States, there are many big organizations and working methods/are&#13;
&#13;
                adapted to these big organizations.     Nothing could be so wrong as to train&#13;
&#13;
                these people in these methods for adapting them to small organizations.&#13;
 CHAIRllAN:     That is perfectly true, am we think that in many cases, most valuable&#13;
&#13;
                experience will be in some of the smaller units     of government departments.&#13;
&#13;
                I am not quite sure whether the Government in the United States is so good&#13;
&#13;
                that you can say it is, a Council of perfection.      In the future, it might&#13;
&#13;
                well be that experience in some smaller countries would be useful as well,&#13;
&#13;
                but we do not think we can start this thing except here, where we can&#13;
&#13;
                have close observation.&#13;
&#13;
 BRESCIANI:      In connection with wnat Mr. Baranski said, I would like to ask, according&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 2261 -&#13;
&amp;#12;~qr:SCIANI   :   to what concept will these people come here - young people, or high&#13;
 Jontld)&#13;
                 officials?&#13;
CHAIRMAN:        Our thought is we would like to get people sufficiently senior that they&#13;
&#13;
                 could go back to their countries and exercise influence.     They are a&#13;
&#13;
                 different cut of people Ulan the trainees that we have.     But there again,&#13;
&#13;
                 we have to try it out, and that is the reason we do not want to publicly&#13;
&#13;
                 launch this thing until it has had trial runs.&#13;
&#13;
BRESCIANI:       It would be as well to have people   who   are able to give a counterpart for&#13;
&#13;
                 what the Bank does for them.   As far as I can see, the problem of under-&#13;
&#13;
                 developed countries has become a central problem in the Bank, and these&#13;
&#13;
                 people could give us same advice on how we could give them help, and&#13;
&#13;
                 what would be the consequences of tilat.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:        It would be very useful.&#13;
  :JffiU:        You say the choice would be made by tile Bank's missions aborad, and I wonder&#13;
&#13;
                 if it would not be a better idea to get men through the Governments, as&#13;
&#13;
                 they are likely to know more about it.&#13;
CHAIRMAN:        The reason is tilat, if we suggest to the Governments, we may have fifty&#13;
&#13;
                 to seventy-five applicants.    What we thought tilat we would do would be&#13;
&#13;
                 to have people in the miss ions in the field, 'Who will have met a number of&#13;
&#13;
                 these people, see someone they thought suitable, and then they would talk&#13;
&#13;
                 about it informally with the Government, and say "How about     a   man like thisll7&#13;
&#13;
                 We are afraid to put out any general announcement in case we get over-&#13;
&#13;
                 whelmed before we are better prepared.      It will be done in consultation&#13;
&#13;
                 with tile Governments, but on the ground, quietly and informa.lly.&#13;
&#13;
ONARAN:          Does the scheme include municipal administration in this country1&#13;
CHAIRMAN:        We think we can make arrangements with some of our cities; some have very&#13;
&#13;
                  good administration and sane very bad.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 2268 -&#13;
&amp;#12;ONARAN:     This is as important as public administration for under-developed countries,&#13;
&#13;
            because they are more backHard in their administration.       I agree with Mr.&#13;
&#13;
            I3aranski there is a danger that unless they are very intelligent when they&#13;
&#13;
            go back they may try to apply all they have seen here.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:   That is important.    Vie will go ahead on this in a quiet way, and see how&#13;
&#13;
            it works.&#13;
&#13;
            There is just one other announcement I would like to make.       I would like&#13;
&#13;
            to invite attention to a circular which was sent out over the Signature of&#13;
&#13;
            the President, dated October 20, regarding the Community Chest in Washington.&#13;
&#13;
            We have in the past contributed generously to the Comnninity Chest, and we&#13;
&#13;
            feel it is the appropriate thing.    We try very carefully to avoid appeals&#13;
&#13;
            for contributions in the Bank, but this is something that covers all the&#13;
&#13;
            chari ties in this community in which we all now live, am as in the past,&#13;
&#13;
            representatives of the Bank's staff will go through the building am we&#13;
&#13;
            hope that   eve~one   will listen to their story and then, if you feel so&#13;
&#13;
            inclined, make such contribution you feel appropriate.       There is no&#13;
&#13;
            pressure on anybody, but we feel that we who are now living in Washington&#13;
&#13;
            should support public cOlilltlmity services.     Mr. Black will not be back until&#13;
&#13;
            Friday, so i f it is satisfactory to the Directors, I would suggest that&#13;
&#13;
            we do not fix the date of the next meeting until he gets back.        I f there&#13;
&#13;
            is nothing up for Tuesday, then it may be later in the week, and an&#13;
&#13;
            announcement will be made.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   ADJOURNED AT 11:50 A.M.&#13;
&#13;
