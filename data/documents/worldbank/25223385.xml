&#13;
1          Introduction&#13;
This document presents a report on the training on the use of the hydrologic model for the Sava River&#13;
Basin (SRB) that has been developed within the Water and Climate Adaptation Plan (WATCAP) being&#13;
prepared by the Consultant for the International Sava River Basin Commission (ISRBC) under World&#13;
Bank funding.1 The model development is described in detail in Annex 1 of the main WATCAP report&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Development of the Hydrologic Model for the Sava River Basinâ&#128;&#157;.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2          Overview&#13;
The training was held in Zagreb on 12-13 November 2014 in the wake of the final WATCAP workshop&#13;
held on 11th November 2014. The training was performed by the consultantâ&#128;&#153;s (COWI) team consisting&#13;
of Jasna Plavsic, Zana Topalovic and Nikola Zlatanovic. The 2-day training was undertaken according&#13;
to the agenda given in section 3.&#13;

Â &#13;
A total of 24 participants attended the training sessions. The participants came from the major stake-&#13;
holders in the Sava Basin riparian countries. The list of participants is given in section 4.&#13;
&#13;
The training consisted of theoretical and practical sessions. The first day was dedicated to introducing&#13;
the HEC-HMS software to the participants, including an overview of the rainfall-runoff modelling tech-&#13;
niques, introduction to the use of HEC-HMS, and tutorials in which participants learned to perform&#13;
basic tasks in HEC-HMS and in HEC Data Storage System Visual Utility Engine (DSSVue). The sec-&#13;
ond day was dedicated to the detailed description of the Sava Basin Hydrologic Model (SBHM) that&#13;
was developed, including technical details necessary for understanding the model organizational&#13;
structure.&#13;
&#13;
The training material was distributed to the participants, including:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢       two versions of the SBHM (one with observed data and one with climate scenarios),&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢       the report on the SBHM development,&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢       presentations and hand-outs for all training sessions in electronic format.&#13;
&#13;
The presentations are also available at the ISRBC web site2.&#13;
&#13;
Interesting and lengthy discussions took place both days, but especially on the second day. The par-&#13;
ticipants seemed to be very interested in the topic and motivated to learn the modelling techniques.&#13;
&#13;
The training assessment was made at the closing of the course. All participants responded to the sur-&#13;
vey. The results are given in Box 1.&#13;
&#13;
Other comments given by participants in the survey are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢       â&#128;&#156;Please consider training in HEC-HMS in duration of 5 days, similar to courses given by HEC of&#13;
        USACE.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢       â&#128;&#156;Concise and with measure, excellent lecturers. Very interesting.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢       â&#128;&#156;Organize a similar event again. Commendation for everything.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢       â&#128;&#156;The training should be enriched with more practical examples for the model itself and possibili-&#13;
        ties for its amendment, with discussion how it would affect the results.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢       â&#128;&#156;It would be good to organize another training in duration of 5-7 days to get into detail of the pro-&#13;
        cesses, from model creation, to calibration and verification, and to model use via simulations, with&#13;
        more practical work.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢       â&#128;&#156;Organize another workshop about use of softwareâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢       â&#128;&#156;Commendations for the concept of the course and for jolly atmosphere.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢       â&#128;&#156;Organize regular courses for HEC-HMS.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢       â&#128;&#156;Everything is perfect.â&#128;&#157;&#13;

     system useâ&#128;&#157; with examples from particular basins; e.g. the Bosna River for BiH, and similar.â&#128;&#157;&#13;

            Water and climate adaptation plan for the
            Sava river basin
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report presents the water and
            climate adaptation plan (WATCAP) developed for the Sava
            river basin (SRB) as result of a study undertaken by the
            World Bank. The WATCAP is intended to help to bridge the gap
            between the climate change predictions for the SRB and the
            decision makers in current and planned water management
            investment projects that will be affected by changing
            climate trends. The purpose of the report is to: (i) assist
            stakeholders and decision makers in assessing and planning
            for the risks generated by climate change impacts on water
            resources; (ii) provide a basis for future plans and studies
            of adaptation to climate change impacts in the SRB; and
            (iii) stimulate cooperation and debate across the basin
            toward additional and more detailed studies on climate
            change impacts at the regional and basin scale. The SRB is
            projected to experience small increases in water use by the
            public water supply, industry, energy, and agricultural and
            irrigation sectors. However, it is widely expected that new
            hydropower plants (HPPs) will be constructed in the near
            future, making energy (primarily through hydropower) the
            most important water use in the SRB.
