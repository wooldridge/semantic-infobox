PREFACE&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Higher prices of agricultural commodities in the wake of the world food price crisis of 2007â&#128;&#147;08 have stimulated renewed interest in agri-&#13;
cultural investment following decades of chronic underinvestment. For many working in the field of agricultural development, this â&#128;&#156;redis-&#13;
coveryâ&#128;&#157; of agriculture as a focus of investment presented a promising and long awaited opportunity to promote the sector within the&#13;
larger agenda of economic development. For others, this resurgence of investment in agriculture appeared fraught with peril. Investments&#13;
involving large-scale land acquisition in particular raised serious concerns over their likely negative impacts on local people who have been&#13;
using that land. A lack of analysis on such investments has meant that much of the debate on this issue has been fueled by anecdotes and&#13;
one-off case studies.&#13;
&#13;
Responding to both concerns, the Inter-Agency Working Groupâ&#128;&#148;consisting of the Food and Agriculture Organization, the International&#13;
Fund for Agricultural Development, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and the World Bankâ&#128;&#148;resolved to collec-&#13;
tively generate a body of empirical knowledge that could be used to identify desirable forms of investment. This knowledge was intended&#13;
to inform the various ongoing consultations, such as those on responsible agricultural investment as well as the ongoing formulation of&#13;
the Sustainable Development Goals. It would also be used in capacity building programs for public officials, investors, and other stakehold-&#13;
ers in the countries concerned. The Working Group members have now produced a number of studies on matters such as alternatives&#13;
to large-scale land investments, different forms of contract farming, and trends and impacts of foreign direct investment in agriculture in&#13;
developing countries. One such study was a meta-analysis of 179 larger-scale agribusiness investments in Africa and Southeast Asia over a&#13;
50-year period.&#13;
&#13;
This report, The Practice of Responsible Investment Principles in Larger-Scale Agricultural Investments, adds another chapter to this growing&#13;
body of literature. The study examines 39 mature agribusiness investments in Africa and Southeast Asia and assesses to what extent their&#13;
activities can be characterized as responsible in terms of respect for local rights, consultation and transparency with stakeholders, support of&#13;
livelihoods, environmental sustainability, and other criteria. More than 550 community stakeholders were interviewed about the impacts the&#13;
investments had had on those they represented. This process of consultation with those affected purposefully provided these local com-&#13;
munities with a voice which the investors and national governments were clearly interested in listening to. This responds to the demand by&#13;
public officials and investors for information about best practices and pitfalls to avoid. The impressions and ideas of local communities have&#13;
enriched this study, and provided unique insights into what factors are at play and their impact on those most directly affected by outside&#13;
investments.&#13;

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This report presents findings from a field-based survey on the conduct of agricultural operations at 39 large-scale, mature agribusiness&#13;
investments in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, focusing in particular on their approaches to social, economic, and environmental&#13;
responsibility. The objective of the report is to provide first-hand, practical knowledge of the approach, behavior, and experience of these&#13;
investments,1 their relationships with surrounding communities and the consequent positive and/or negative outcomes for these com-&#13;
munities, host countries, other stakeholders, and the investors themselves.&#13;
&#13;
The lessons learned and good practices identified are intended to inform the work of government bodies, investors, non-governmental&#13;
organizations (NGOs), development agencies, and other institutions that promote responsible investment in agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
Experienced agricultural experts, together with UNCTAD and World Bank staff, spent 2 to 3 days interviewing senior management at each&#13;
agribusiness site to complete a semi-structured questionnaire covering operational and financial information, as well as details of the inves-&#13;
torâ&#128;&#153;s approach to a wide range of socioeconomic and environmental issues. Investors also provided researchers with contracts, reporting&#13;
tools, and other documentation relevant to the study. A further 2 to 3 days were spent interviewing surrounding communities and other&#13;
stakeholders to ascertain how people perceived and were impacted by the operations. These latter interviews were conducted in an open-&#13;
ended fashion, allowing external stakeholders to raise issues that were important to them. The views of over 550 external stakeholders have&#13;
been elicited in the conduct of 240 separate stakeholder interviews.&#13;
&#13;
On balance, the investments studied have generated positive socioeconomic benefits for surrounding communities and host countries.&#13;
Figures E.1â&#128;&#147;E.6 show the most common positive and negative impacts of the investments surveyed, as mentioned by external stakeholders&#13;
during the interviews. These provide an overview of how these investments were perceived by those affected by them.&#13;
&#13;
Job creation was the most frequently cited benefit arising from the investments (figure E.1); indeed, investors in the sample operations&#13;
employed around 40,000 peopleâ&#128;&#148;an average of one job for every 20 hectares of landâ&#128;&#148;often in remote areas where formal employment&#13;
had not previously existed (table E.1). Investors also indirectly contributed to employment opportunities by providing a stable market for&#13;
outgrowersâ&#128;&#153; produce: for example, the 11 investors with outgrower schemes helped to support the livelihoods of 150,000 contract farmers&#13;
in total (table E.2). The concomitant rise in rural incomes contributed positively to food security, directly and indirectly.&#13;
&#13;
Other notable tendencies toward more socially or financially inclusive business models were mentioned by communities and stakeholders.&#13;
Investors provided social services such as education, health, rural and farming infrastructure, local water provision schemes, and access to&#13;
finance. Finally, investors introduced new farming technology and practices which, in rare but significant instances, had a catalytic impact&#13;
which extended far beyond the investor.&#13;
&#13;

1	 Throughout this report the terms â&#128;&#156;investmentâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;investorâ&#128;&#157; are used to describe the agribusinesses examined in this survey. Investment in agriculture&#13;
   involves a much wider set of actors apart from large-scale agribusinesses, most notably small farmers investing in their own farms.&#13;

      Notes: These figures were created by classifying information from stakeholder interviews into whether the investment was perceived to have a positive or negative impact,&#13;
      with the information further categorized by issue under each of these two classifications. For example, an interviewee who stated he was happy to have a job with the investor&#13;
      would be classified as having expressed a positive impact with respect to employment. Some issues appear as both a positive and negative impact because there can be both&#13;
      positive and negative dimensions to an investmentâ&#128;&#153;s impact with respect to each issue. For example, an investor may have improved local water access by installing hand&#13;
      pumps, but may also have had a negative impact by polluting water sources used by local communities because of environmentally unsound agricultural practices.&#13;

                              Chart shows the percentage of an investorâ&#128;&#153;s land allocation that was actively cropped, being developed, or used for ancillary&#13;
                          purposes such as employee housing. Only those investments with land allocations are included, that is, processing and trading&#13;
                          operations are excluded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As well as the above benefits, negative impacts also arose in the investments examined (figure E.2). Most prominent were disputes over&#13;
access to land, such as conflict between the formal rights provided to the investor by the state and the informal rights of existing users of&#13;
the land. Such situations were at times exacerbated by a lack of clarity on the conditions and process for land acquisition, and further com-&#13;
pounded in a significant number of cases where investors were using only a small portion of their land allocation (figure E.7). Despite some&#13;
positive examples, resettlement was seldom sufficiently consultative, inclusive, or adequately compensated. This lack of consultation was&#13;
symptomatic of a broader concern. Involvement by local communities in decisions affecting them was deemed insufficient; and, moreover,&#13;
procedures to raise grievances or hold investors to account were commonly absent. Assessment, understanding, and monitoring of the&#13;
environmental impact of investments was generally inadequate, especially with regard to consequences for water resources (table E.3).&#13;
&#13;
Overall, communities and external stakeholders interviewed felt that the benefits of the investments outweighed the negative impacts, and&#13;
were appreciative of the presence of the investor (figure E.8). Nevertheless, there is a wide range of outcomes arising from these investments&#13;

                that issue. The horizontal axis shows the number of stakeholders which mentioned the investment as having a negative impact. The size of the&#13;

      in terms of their socioeconomic and environmental impacts, their broader impact on the host country, and the operational and financial&#13;
      success of the investment itself. There are some investments that have generated mostly positive outcomes, while others have generated&#13;
      mostly negative outcomes (figure E.9). Most exhibit a mixture of positive and negative impacts, performing well on some aspects, but with&#13;
      significant room for improvement on others.&#13;
&#13;
      A somewhat surprising finding from this research, at least at first glance, is that many investors were in operational and financial difficulty.&#13;
      Around 45 percent of investors were materially behind schedule or operating below capacity. About the same share were unprofitable at&#13;
      the time of survey.&#13;
&#13;
      Investors highlighted a number of constraints which hindered their prospects of success (figure E.10). They noted the importance of host&#13;
      country governments in creating an enabling environment which allows investors to survive, thrive, and contribute to the local community&#13;
      and the broader economy. International investors in several countries experienced a lack of a clear, transparent, and consistent approach&#13;
      toward foreign investment in agriculture, including policies and procedures for the purchase or lease of land. Access to finance, inadequate&#13;
      infrastructure, and difficulties in sourcing local, qualified staff were other key constraints on profitability.&#13;
&#13;
      Financial and operational success is an essential precondition for agricultural investments to make a positive contribution to development,&#13;
      whereas failure can create lose-lose-lose situations for investors, host countries, and local communities alike. In this regard, investors noted&#13;
      the importance of striking the right balance between imposing necessary requirements and regulations which promoted responsible&#13;
      investment, on the one hand, and ensuring that requirements were not so burdensome as to preclude much needed investment by agri-&#13;
      businesses, on the other.&#13;
&#13;
      A key finding of this research is that a potentially win-win situation vis-Ã -vis investment performance and their wider positive economic,&#13;
      social, and environmental impact is achievable. In the survey, investors that were financially and operationally successful tended also to&#13;

be those that had the most positive impact on their host economies and surrounding communitiesâ&#128;&#148;the result of more sophisticated&#13;
approaches to social and environmental responsibility. Similarly, those investments which were well-integrated with the host country and&#13;
surrounding community were most likely to be financially successful. Investors which acquired land but did not conduct thorough consulta-&#13;
tions with communities and impact assessments, or left it to host governments to conduct them on their behalf, often found themselves&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Civil society organizations in some cases played an important role in helping investors and local communities to forge partnerships, increas-&#13;
        ing the likelihood of mutually beneficial solutions. Particularly significant in this research was the role of NGOs in ensuring that relevant&#13;
        stakeholders to an investment had their voices heard, especially in community consultations, impact assessments, and grievance mecha-&#13;
        nisms. NGOs were also able to publicize conflicts between investors, governments, and stakeholders and contribute to greater transparency&#13;
        on the conduct of agricultural investment. But in some cases, investors perceived that this was done in an inflammatory or antagonistic,&#13;
        rather than constructive, fashion which served the NGOâ&#128;&#153;s own interest but was detrimental to the interests of not only investors but also&#13;
        local communities.&#13;
&#13;
        The diversity of experiences, performance, and impacts of investments in the survey suggests that a wide range of factors influence the&#13;
        outcomes of an agricultural investment. Some factors are context specific. As such, one cannot be categorical about the types of invest-&#13;
        ment that are most or least desirable. This study finds that the static attributes of the investor (its crop, country of origin, and so on) are less&#13;
        important than the dynamic actions, policies, and practices of the investor and host country government in determining the outcome of&#13;
        investments. The challenge is to understand how agricultural investment can be conducted in a responsible and sustainable manner, which&#13;
        maximizes the associated benefits and minimizes the potential risks.&#13;
&#13;
        Table E.3 summarizes the key benefits and negative outcomes of the investments studied, based on analyses of all material collected during&#13;
        the researchâ&#128;&#148;stakeholder interviews, company questionnaires, other documentation, and discussions with civil society.&#13;
&#13;
        Table E.4 summarizes the key policies and practices identified in this research which helped lead to better outcomes in the investments&#13;
        studied. But neither this study, nor any other, can provide all the answers. The findings of this report do not represent a final, exhaustive list&#13;
        of good and bad policies or practices, but rather those observed during the course of the fieldwork to have influenced the outcomes for&#13;
        local communities, host countries, and investors.&#13;
&#13;
        These lessons must be heard and integrated carefully with findings from other research and acted upon in order to feed the worldâ&#128;&#153;s burgeon-&#13;
        ing population in a sustainable manner that preserves natural resources, utilizes agriculture as an engine for inclusive growth, and fosters&#13;
        long-term development. The achievement of these goals will require more investment, private and public. The central role of smallholder&#13;

&#13;
farmersâ&#128;&#153; investment in their own farms in any strategy for promoting the required agricultural investment is well-established.2 But there&#13;
nevertheless remains a key role for other forms of investment, including from the types of private sector investors included in this study. This&#13;
research finds that private sector investments, including those that involve land acquisition, can generate positive outcomes if conducted&#13;
in a socially and environmentally responsible manner.&#13;
&#13;
This report is a contribution to a growing body of evidence-based knowledge, including from work by the Inter-Agency Working Group&#13;
(IAWG) comprised of UNCTAD, the World Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the International Fund for Agricultural&#13;
Development (IFAD), aimed at distilling lessons from past and current agricultural investments.3 This research program continues to generate&#13;
knowledge on what the appropriate conduct of agricultural investment comprises in practical and operational terms, in order to satisfy both&#13;
the needs of corporate performance and economic, social, and environmentally sustainable development. This research yields lessons for the&#13;
content and refinement of the PRAI, which will be combined with those from other work of the IAWG and reflected in future work programs.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The data collected for this study represent a snapshot of a particular point in time. In addition, some relevant issues identified during the&#13;
     field work were not fully investigated due to time constraints. These and many other issues identified would benefit from more detailed&#13;
     study over an extended period. For these reasons, a follow-up project will be to revisit 12â&#128;&#147;15 investments and conduct more detailed field&#13;
     research to deepen the understanding of impacts and how they have evolved.&#13;
&#13;
     This report also emphasizes that many of the decisions and actions which determine the ultimate outcome of investments are taken&#13;
     prior to the investment or during its initial phases. For this reason, the IAWG of UNCTAD, the World Bank, FAO, and IFAD plan to embark&#13;
     on a new field program: the pilot-use of responsible agricultural investment principles working with investors (companies), governments,&#13;
     communities and other stakeholders from the outset of a project. The primary objective is to infuse responsible principles and practices into&#13;
     (1) agribusiness operations and (2) the interaction of these operations with local communities, the environment, and the economy as a&#13;
     whole. The intention is for investors to apply the principles to the establishment phase of their new agribusiness investments, and incorpo-&#13;
     rate them into their business processes, in dialogue with governments and communities.&#13;

banks, there were still a number of interviewees who complained                                    ment on the part of the investor. There were four investors in the&#13;

of bridge or commodity finance from local banks exacerbates this                                   Almost 60 percent of investors have some kind of relatively formal-&#13;
problem. Secondly, several investors cited the difficulty in ensuring                              ized social or rural development program (defined as, at a minimum,&#13;
that terms of loan contract were upheld, in particular the condition                               an internally agreed program with objectives and funding). Only&#13;
that the produce of outgrowers benefiting from the loan is sold to                                 about 40 percent have an explicit agreement with local communi-&#13;

     TABLE 7.1 Selected Key Lessons for Investors, Host Governments, and Other Stakeholders&#13;
                                                                                 A. SELECTED KEY LESSONS FOR INVESTORS&#13;
     Consultations and ongoing dialogue with local communities&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Consultations were a key step in developing a strong relationship with local communities. This generated more positive socioeconomic outcomes and was in the interests of investor because it&#13;
        contributed to financial and operational success, in particular by minimizing the risk of land disputes.&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Initial consultations were time consuming and expensive, particularly for new investments.&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Consultations were most effective when investors took primary responsibility for their conduct; â&#128;&#156;outsourcingâ&#128;&#157; of the process to host governments or land agents led to poor outcomes.&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Formally established procedures through which stakeholders could raise grievances and seek redress contributed to better relations with local communities.&#13;
     Land rights and resettlement&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Many investors were expending significant resources dealing with disputes over access to land. The risk of this can be minimized through full and early assessment and consultation of existing rights&#13;
        to and usage of the land, formal and informal.&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; It can be perilous for the investor to assume that the land acquired is being provided by the government without any existing land disputes.&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Some investors found that the best solution with regard to resettlement was to leave communities in situ and work with or around them, rather than undertaking difficult resettlement proce-&#13;
        dures. When resettlement did occur, it was conducted through a formal, transparent, inclusive, consultative process.&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Failure to develop the land in accordance with expectations was a significant source of tension between investors, local communities, and host governments. It is important to set expectations&#13;
        through the consultation process.&#13;
&#13;
     Due diligence and business planning&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Business plans provided by host government were often based on unrealistic assumptions and substandard assessments of crop suitability and other environmental factors.&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Findings from impact assessments and community consultations were not incorporated into business plans, leading to problems developing the project which could have been foreseen.&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Some investors had success in phasing their investment. That is, obtaining a small land area initially and only seeking more land once the first allocation is running successfully. This is particularly&#13;
        suitable for new business models, crops, or techniques.&#13;
&#13;
     Environmental impact&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; When environmental impact assessments were conducted on the investorâ&#128;&#153;s behalf by host governments or land agents, this led to poor outcomes. The conduct of impact assessments should be&#13;
        primarily the responsibility of investors.&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Impact assessments were too often â&#128;&#156;box-tickingâ&#128;&#157; exercises, not translated into environmental management plans which are actively incorporated into the conduct of the business.&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; More assessment and monitoring is needed of the impact of the investment on water resources.&#13;
     Employment&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; There is pressure to employ local people and doing so contributes to better working relationships. But it can be challenging due to a skills gap. Training programs which help integrate local com-&#13;
        munities into the workforce should be considered.&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Some investors were paying inadequate wages and offering unacceptable working conditions, leading to tension between staff and the investor. There was a gender imbalance at most investments&#13;
        which should be addressed.&#13;
&#13;
     Social development programs and financially inclusive business models&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Social or rural development initiatives produced better outcomes if they were agreed through an inclusive, consultative approach to gain an understanding of local development visions.&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Financially inclusive business models have been successful in forging partnerships with local communities.&#13;
     Outgrower schemes&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Outgrower schemes were most successful when the business model was resolved before outgrowers were introduced.&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; A lack of transparency and inclusivity of outgrowers in the pricing mechanisms for their crops hindered the successful operation of outgrower schemes.&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Marginalized groups, including women, were less likely to participate in outgrower schemes. Consideration should be given to how to improve access for these groups.&#13;
     Food security&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; The main positive contribution most investors made to food security was through direct employment and outgrower schemes. But wages for employees and prices for outgrowers must be sufficient&#13;
        to support an adequate standard of living.&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; The main negative contribution was through reduced access to land. The investor should ensure that its operations are not detrimental to existing sources of food security.&#13;
     Transparency&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; A lack of transparency can generate fear and uncertainty about investor intentions and also open the door for unfounded criticism. Investors should consider making more information publicly&#13;
        available.&#13;
                                                                              B. SELECTED KEY LESSONS FOR GOVERNMENTS&#13;
     Prescreening and selection of investors&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; In many cases, prescreening of foreign investors can be improved to increase the prevalence of investors likely to make a positive contribution to the host country. Prescreening should include, at a&#13;
        minimum, assessment of investorsâ&#128;&#153; financial strength and technical capabilities, their proposed approach with respect to consultations and impact assessments, and their commitments in terms of&#13;
        the benefits that the investor will bring to the host country.&#13;
     â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; More foreign investors are adopting social development programs or financially inclusive business models. Host governments can seek commitments for such aspects in advance.&#13;

 Ongoing monitoring of investors&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Ongoing monitoring of investments can be strengthened. The better approaches were not solely productivity-focused, but more intensive and included monitoring of the socioeconomic impacts of&#13;
    an investment.&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Monitoring of investorsâ&#128;&#153; environmental impact, including use of water resources, and adherence to environmental regulations was in most cases inadequate.&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; By monitoring investors, host governments can prepare for failure, for example by discussing and negotiating with potential takeover buyers in advance. Failed investments can have severe reper-&#13;
    cussions for the local community in terms of the void in employment as well as other areas such as social services.&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Many investors were not putting their land allocation to full use. Governments should seek commitments from investors about the pace at which the operation will develop and retain the ability to&#13;
    repossess the land if commitments are not upheld.&#13;
&#13;
 Conduct of consultations, impact assessments, and business plans&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; The conduct of consultations, impact assessments, due diligence, and the creation of business plans were most effective when primarily the responsibility of the investor. Host governments should&#13;
    establish regulations or guidelines for their conduct and stringently monitor adherence, but not conduct these activities for investors.&#13;
&#13;
 Phasing of investors and approvals&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Large land allocations, particularly to investors introducing new crops, are highly risky. Investors could be required to progress in stages. This can be achieved by providing small concession areas&#13;
    initially, waiting for the investor to prove its concept and capability to develop the land in accordance with expectations, and only then provide more land.&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Some governments had allowed foreign investment in agriculture to proceed at a faster pace than they could realistically assess and monitor the investors. Wherever necessary, governments should&#13;
    consider how to improve their capacity and, if necessary, consider slowing down the approval of new agricultural investments.&#13;
&#13;
 Land rights and resettlement&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; A clear regulatory framework for land acquisition approvals and a formalization of local communitiesâ&#128;&#153; tenure rights under a registry system contributed to reducing the risks of land disputes.&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Business models with low land needs, such as processing operations, can provide important development benefits without the land issues associated with estate operations.&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Clear, transparent procedures to follow and standard valuations for compensation in the case of resettlement could be developed. Adherence should be monitored.&#13;
 Employment and contribution to rural livelihoods&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Large land allocations do not necessarily create the most jobs per hectare. Outgrower schemes can be effective in supporting livelihoods while allowing people to retain their most valuable asset:&#13;
    their land. Governments should consider which investors and business models are likely to maximize direct and indirect employment as these are key benefits of agricultural investment.&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Governments should consider the whole value-chain and promote the down-stream of value-addition of the raw materials produced from land made available, thereby maximizing employment&#13;
    and other benefits.&#13;
&#13;
 Transparency&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; In general, there was an insufficient amount of publicly available information to ensure the fully transparent and accountable conduct of agricultural investment. Governments should publicize land&#13;
    applications under review and approved, including on an investment registry website.&#13;
&#13;
 Technology transfer&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Technology transfer was by no means an assured benefit of foreign agricultural investment.&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Innovation in new crops, business models, techniques should be encouraged, but are highly risky so should not be initially operated on a large scale. The business model of the investor should be&#13;
    proven before large land allocations are provided or outgrowers are introduced.&#13;
                                                               C. SELECTED KEY LESSONS FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND NGOs&#13;
 Consultations between investors and communities&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Representatives of civil society played a useful role in monitoring consultations and can work with investors to ensure that all relevant communities and stakeholders are included within the&#13;
    consultation process.&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; There were instances where agreements were not documented, leading to confusion and disputes. Local communities should ensure that all agreement and commitments made through consulta-&#13;
    tions are documented in writing.&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Investors said it was easier to include local communities which were well-organized. NGOs can assist local communities in this regard.&#13;
 Land rights and resettlement&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Some NGOs were effective in raising community awareness regarding their rights and how to exercise them, as well as ensuring that people had a realistic assessment of the value of their land in&#13;
    the case of resettlement.&#13;
&#13;
 Monitoring investors&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Civil society can play a role in monitoring conflicts between investors and stakeholder or instances where an investment is degrading natural resources, and making those issues public or known to&#13;
    relevant authorities. This should be conducted in a constructive, rather than antagonistic, fashion.&#13;
&#13;
 Marginalized communities and groups&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; NGOs can play a key role in helping investors to forge partnerships with marginalized groups, for example by helping them link with outgrower schemes and by advocating that their needs are&#13;
    considered when deciding social development programs.&#13;
&#13;
 Engagement with investors&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Civil society could forge partnerships with the private sector to stimulate responsible inclusive investments that give due consideration to reduction of rural poverty and more equitable benefit&#13;
    sharing with farmers and the local communities.&#13;

            The practice of responsible investment
            principles in larger-scale agricultural investments :
            implications for corporate performance and impact on local communities
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report presents findings from a
            field-based survey on the conduct of agricultural operations
            at 39 large-scale, mature agribusiness investments in
            sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. The objective of the
            report is to provide first-hand, practical knowledge of the
            approach, behavior, and experience of these investments,
            their relationships with surrounding communities and the
            consequent positive and/or negative outcomes for these
            communities, host countries, other stakeholders, and the
            investors themselves. More than 550 community stakeholders
            were interviewed about the impacts the investments had on
            those they represented. These impressions and ideas of local
            communities enriched this study and provided unique insights
            into what factors are at play, and their impact on those
            most directly affected by outside investments. The lessons
            learned and good practices identified are intended to inform
            the work of government bodies, investors, non-governmental
            organizations, development agencies, and other institutions
            that promote responsible investment in agriculture.
