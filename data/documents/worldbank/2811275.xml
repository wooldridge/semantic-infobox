                                   A. BACKGROUND AND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sector Needsand Priorities&#13;
&#13;
1.      Agricultural production accounts for over half o f Afghanistan's GDP and most o f its direct&#13;
exports. More than three-quarters o f the population live in rural areas and depend on agnculture as their&#13;
main source o f livelihood. Most o fthe agricultural population i s likely to be below the poverty line. The&#13;
main issue facing the Afghans i s how to transform the poorly performing subsistence agricultural sector&#13;
into a modem, dynamic and sustainable rural economy that provides food security, generates farm&#13;
income, reduces vulnerability and expands livelihood opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Lack o f assured and timely water supply at the farm-level through the existing irrigation system&#13;
appears to be one o f the most important constraints to food production, agricultural growth and rural&#13;
development. This problem has worsened in the last 25 years o f conflict, neglect, floods and droughts.&#13;
Based on the available information, in 2002, the actual area under irrigation was only about 33% of the&#13;
area under irrigation in 1993. Furthermore, the present dilapidated irrigation system i s working at only&#13;
about 25% o f its efficiency; the normi s about 40-60%.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Furthermore, at present, Afghanistan uses only about 30% o f the total estimated water resources&#13;
(both surface and groundwater) available inthe country. Nearly all o f this water is used for irrigation. In&#13;
addition to watering the crops, the irrigation system i s also a source o f drinkingwater supply for humans&#13;
and livestock in the rural areas. Clearly, there i s substantial scope for improving the quality (timely&#13;
delivery) and expanding the quantity (area under assured irrigation) o f irrigation, thereby reducing&#13;
vulnerability to droughts and improving drinlungwater supply inrural Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Management o f water resources inAfghanistan is also constrained by the lack o f accurate and up-&#13;
to-date hydro-meteorological information (the latest information i s 25 years old) for proper planning,&#13;
development and use o f national water resources. In order to make the best use o f national water&#13;
resources and ensure their sustainable management, the collection and analysis o f hydrological and&#13;
meteorological data is essential. The analyzed data are used for the identification and preparation o f&#13;
water resources projects such as irrigation scheme rehabilitation, potable water supply and hydropower&#13;
development. However, the hydrological monitoring activities in Afghanistan ceased around 1978 and&#13;
the 25 year old historical data i s less representative and less appropriate for planning due to climatic&#13;
changes as well as changes inthe magnitude and flow o f the national water resources.&#13;
&#13;
5.      Appropriate institutions and adequate institutional capacity i s absolutely essential for sustainable&#13;
use and management o fnational water resources. However, Afghanistan's institutional capacity for water&#13;
management has also deteriorated significantly in the last 25 years. The quality and quantity o f the&#13;
professional staff essential to plan and manage the national irrigation system, hydro-meteorological&#13;
network and water resources have declined. The technical, administrative, communication and&#13;
measurement facilities, equipment and even documents for the irrigatiodwater sector have been damaged&#13;
or destroyed. This institutional capacity needs to be developed and re-built on an urgent basis. While the&#13;
development o f institutions and institutional capacity i s a long-term process, it has to begin now for&#13;
Afghanistan to be able to rehabilitate its national irrigation system and manage its national water&#13;
resources, such that it i s also consistent with appropriate fiduciary and safeguards standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Government Response and Strategy&#13;
&#13;
6.       The transitional Government o f Afghanistan has articulated a national strategy for economic&#13;
development in its National Development Framework (NDF, April 2002).                    One o f the national&#13;
development programs deals specifically with natural resource management, including agriculture and&#13;
water. The NDF recognizes the economic importance o f both agriculture and irrigation in transforming&#13;
the rural economy, improving food security, reducing vulnerability and expanding livelihood&#13;
opportunities for the rural population .&#13;
&#13;
7.       The NDF also recognizes that agriculture i s the main source o f livelihood for over 75% o f the&#13;
Afghan population. However, the agricultural sector has suffered significantly over the last 25 years o f&#13;
the conflict, droughts and dis-functioning national institutions that serve agriculture. The NDF accords a&#13;
highpriority to the recovery o f the agricultural sector for it to be able to serve as the engine o fpro-poor&#13;
economic growth and poverty reduction. One o f the most important components o f agricultural recovery&#13;
strategy i s the rehabilitationo f the national irrigation system.&#13;
&#13;
8.       In addition, NDF also recognizes that Country's water resources are to be used in the most&#13;
environmentally and socially sustainable manner. This aim has come into sharp focus in the past few&#13;
years because o f the severe and long-term droughts experienced by Afghanistan.              While ensuring&#13;
adequate water supply for irrigation i s a high national priority, it must be done in a way that does not&#13;
adversely affect the traditional norms o f collective responsibility o f local communities for the operations&#13;
and maintenance of the centuries-old traditional (90% of the national irrigation system i s traditional)&#13;
irrigation system.&#13;
&#13;
9.       The transitional Government o f Afghanistan has requested World Bank financing for the NDF's&#13;
water resources program, including the rehabilitation o f the irrigation system on an emergency basis.&#13;
This is part o f the multi-million and multi-donor national program proposed by the Government that is&#13;
designed to rehabilitate the irrigation system over a period o f three years. This program consists of&#13;
rehabilitation o f small, medium and large irrigation schemes, rehabilitation o f national hydro-&#13;
meteorologicalobservation network and institutional development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              B. BANKRESPONSEAND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Bank Support for Recovery&#13;
&#13;
10.      The World Bank has played an important role by supporting reconstruction and economic&#13;
recovery in Afghanistan. The World Bank participated in the Needs Assessment which provided a basis&#13;
for a program o f financial assistance and advisory services.           The Bank has been managing the&#13;
Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF). The Bank has also provided both IDA grants and IDA&#13;
credits to support recovery, reconstruction and institutional development in all the critical sectors o f the&#13;
Afghanistan economy.&#13;
&#13;
11.      The Transitional Support Strategy (TSS), designed to support the NDF, was approved by the&#13;
World Bank Board inMarch 2003. Under TSS, which i s also designed to support transition from short-&#13;
term emergency support to a long-term development support, the Bank will focus on four areas. These&#13;
are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         0    Improving livelihoods:      employment generation,     community development, and rural&#13;
              development, including management o f national water resources.&#13;

The proposed Emergency Irrigation Rehabilitation Project will support activities that are designed to&#13;
improve livelihood opportunities inthe rural areas through a rehabilitated irrigation system and improved&#13;
management of national water resources.&#13;
&#13;
Rationalefor BankInvolvement&#13;
&#13;
12.     The project provides an emergency response to the Govemment's request for rehabilitating the&#13;
national irrigation system in priority locations in all the five river basins o f Afghanistan, for improving&#13;
the hydro-meteorological information base for national water resources, and for supporting institutional&#13;
development o f agencies dealing with irrigation and water. The project i s consistent with the objectives&#13;
outlined in the Government's NDF and the World Bank's TSS for Afghanistan. The project i s expected&#13;
to improve livelihood in the rural areas by providing assured irrigation water supply, improving water&#13;
resources management, increasing agricultural production and creating rural employment.&#13;
&#13;
13.     The government recognizes the World Bank to be a key development partner in its efforts to&#13;
promote rehabilitation, reconstruction and recovery o f irrigated agricultural sector that is at the core o f&#13;
Afghanistan economy at present. This i s due to: (i)    World Bank has a global experience in supporting&#13;
rehabilitation o f the irrigation system; and (ii)&#13;
                                                 while this i s the first project that i s focused primarily on&#13;
agriculture, World Bank i s already implementing several projects with a focus on the rural sector such as&#13;
the National Emergency Employment Program (NEEP) and the National Solidarityprogram (NSP).&#13;
&#13;
14.      The World Bank is also working very closely with the other multilateral (ADB, and EU) and&#13;
bilateral (USAID, CIDA, JICNJBIC, GTZ and DFID) donors that either are already involved or are&#13;
planning to get involved in the water and agricultural sectors. The project, however, will be the largest&#13;
and most comprehensive intervention with a particular focus on rehabilitation o f the existing national&#13;
irrigation systemwhich will likely establish the necessary framework for donor support for the sector.&#13;

                        C. DETAILED PROJECTDESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
&#13;
15.      The primary target group i s the farmers and their families living in the rural areas covered by&#13;
irrigation schemes to be rehabilitated. The project development objective i s to provide farmers in the&#13;
project areas with improved, reliable and equitable distribution o f irrigation water to increase agncultural&#13;
productivity and farm income, improve food security and livelihoods, and reduce vulnerability due to&#13;
droughts.&#13;
&#13;
16.     This objective would be achieved by (i)     rehabilitating and improving the existing dilapidated&#13;
irrigation infrastructure; (ii) restoring and modernizing the hydro-meteorological network for better&#13;
monitoring, planning, sustainable use and management o f water resources, including contingency&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
planning for droughts and floods; and (iii)     developing the institutional capacity o f public sector water&#13;
institutions, existing community water organizations and farmers for operating and maintaining irrigation&#13;
system in a sustainable manner. This will assist in reducing poverty in the rural areas, accelerate&#13;
transition to sustainable agnculture andlay the foundation for a dynamic rural economy inAfghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
ProjectComponents&#13;
&#13;
17.      The project i s the first Bank project that i s designed to specifically focus on the agricultural&#13;
sector. It will target priority investments to rehabilitate the existing dilapidated irrigation system and the&#13;
hydro-meteorological network, using the river basin management approach. The project consists of four&#13;
components. These are: (i)    rehabilitationo firrigation schemes; (ii)rehabilitationo f hydro-meteorological&#13;
network; (iii)preparation o f feasibility studies and monitoring; and (iv) institutional development.&#13;
Project cost by components i s summarized inAppendix 1.&#13;
&#13;
ComponentA: Rehabilitationof irrigationSchemes (US$50 million)&#13;
&#13;
18.      The rehabilitation and the improvement o f irrigation infrastructure i s part o f the Government's&#13;
agricultural rehabilitation program.      It is estimated that there are more than one million hectares of&#13;
potentially irrigable land, viz. land which was irrigated in the past, requiring rehabilitation o f irrigation&#13;
infrastructure. Further details regarding rehabilitation o f irrigation schemes in Afghanistan are provided&#13;
inAppendix 4.&#13;
&#13;
19.      Scope of rehabilitation needs: The direct negative impact o f war on irrigation infrastructure&#13;
was a consequence o f destruction as well as the exodus o f farmers leaving behind the schemes without&#13;
attendance.    Since 1992, many refugees have retumed to their villages and tried to use the irrigation&#13;
schemes again. Small traditional irrigation schemes were relatively easy to put under operation again. The&#13;
larger the schemes, however, the greater were the problems encountered: complete sedimentation o f the&#13;
conveyance canals, division o f the command area among different local commanders, and hence the&#13;
impossibility to install the former mirabhakil system again. In spite o f some efforts, there remains the&#13;
enormous task o f rehabilitating about half (1.3 million hectares) o f Afghanistan's irrigation schemes.&#13;
This includes about one million ha o f traditional irrigation schemes supplied by perennial rivers and&#13;
streams as well as about 50,000 ha supplied by springs and karezes, all operated and maintained by the&#13;
farmers themselves, and about 250,000 ha o f modern irrigation schemes formerly operated and&#13;
maintainedby the Govemment.&#13;
&#13;
20.      Type of rehabilitation works: h g a t i o n rehabilitation activities can be classified into five&#13;
categories: the verification, maintenance, construction, management and training. Irrigation rehabilitation&#13;
activities in the coming three years need to focus on types o f works which are expected to (i)       increase&#13;
agricultural output o f the individual farmer; (ii)prevent irrigation schemes from further destruction by&#13;
floods andor salinization; and (iii)strengthen local capacities in the (re)design, (re)construction,&#13;
operation and management o f irrigation schemes.&#13;
&#13;
21.      Irrigation Schemes to be rehabilitated: The project addresses the rehabilitation of existing&#13;
irrigation schemes (sub-projects). Depending on their size (in terms o f area under irrigation), their water&#13;
conveyance system (one or several canals supplied by one water resource), and the estimated&#13;
rehabilitation cost, the existing irrigation schemes are divided into three broad categories: small, medium&#13;
and large. The rehabilitationo f all irrigation schemes require engineering surveys and design. However,&#13;
in general, the complexity o f irrigation scheme rehabilitation increases with the size and hence the need&#13;
for engineering input also increases. The final selection o f all (small, medium and large) irrigation&#13;
schemes for rehabilitationunder the project, however, must meet the appropriate scheme selection criteria&#13;
&#13;
                                                       4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
agreed with the Government (see Appendix 5). In order to ensure sustainability o f irrigation schemes,&#13;
community water organizations or local water users' associations will be actively involved in both&#13;
rehabilitationand operations and maintenance (see Appendix 6).&#13;
&#13;
22.      All o f about 1,100 small irrigation schemes, that are expected to be rehabilitated under the&#13;
project, will be grouped into an annual implementation list ranked according to priority. Priority should&#13;
be given to canal and karez rehabilitation in the provinces o f Kandahar and Wardak; to canal&#13;
rehabilitation in the provinces o f Herat, Parwan and Badakhshan, and to kurez rehabilitation in the&#13;
provinces o f Ghazni and Zabul. Project interventions will deal with the rehabilitation of crucial hydraulic&#13;
structures to solve key problems o f individual schemes and overcome bottlenecks o f otherwise&#13;
functioning schemes.&#13;
&#13;
23.      Each o f about 160 medium irrigation schemes under the project will be selected by following the&#13;
scheme selection criteria. The rehabilitation package for each irrigation scheme will include (i)      detailed&#13;
scope o f work; (ii)  detailed survey; (iii)  detailed scheme rehabilitation design work; and (iv) bidding&#13;
documents. The provinces of Herat, Kandahar, Kunduz, Parwan, Ghazni, Baghlan and Helmand have&#13;
been identified to be priority provinces for the rehabilitation o f medium and large irrigation scheme.&#13;
Main objective o f all rehabilitation efforts i s to systematically rehabilitate mediumirrigation schemes  - at&#13;
watershed level - inorder to maximize water use through an increase o f the overall system efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
24.      The selection, detailed analysis and documentation for the procurement o f about 20 large&#13;
irrigation schemes to be rehabilitated under the project will be the same as for the medium irrigation&#13;
schemes. However, the rehabilitation o f large irrigation schemes to be rehabilitated under the project i s&#13;
more complex and costly. Main objective i s to systematically rehabilitate - at sub-basin level        -  large&#13;
irrigation schemes in order to optimize the sustainable use o f water resources in priority watersheds as&#13;
well as to safeguard nationalnatural and capital assets.&#13;
&#13;
25.      A total o f approximately 1,280 irrigation schemes covering 280,000 ha are proposed for&#13;
rehabilitation under the project during the three year project period, including 1,100 small irrigation&#13;
schemes covering 110,000 ha; 160 medium irrigation schemes covering 120,000 ha; and 20 large&#13;
irrigation schemes covering 50,000 ha (see Table 1). Due to the expected increase in water use efficiency&#13;
and/or water availability, it i s expected that the irrigatedarea after rehabilitation will be about 25% larger&#13;
than the irrigated area before rehabilitation, bringing the total irrigated area having benefited from the&#13;
Project to an estimated 350,000 ha. Each scheme (sub-project) will be identified, selected, promoted,&#13;
appraised, approved, carried out and monitored in accordance with procedures and other provisions&#13;
outlined inthis Technical Annex and will be reflectedinthe project implementationmanual.&#13;
&#13;
Component B: Rehabilitation of Hydro-meteorologicalNetwork (US$lO million)&#13;
&#13;
26.      In order to make the best use o f the country's water resources and ensure their sustainable&#13;
management, the collection and analysis o f hydrological and meteorological data i s essential.            This&#13;
includes an observation network o f hydrological (river gauge) and meteorological (weather) stations,&#13;
where the most important parameters determining spatial and temporal availability and variability o f&#13;
water are measured. The analyzed data are used for the identification and preparation o f water resources&#13;
projects, such as irrigation scheme rehabilitation, potable water supply and hydropower development. In&#13;
addition, regular annual floods and the difficulties encountered in quantifying the negative impact o f&#13;
floods and droughts and the necessary mitigation measures during the recent drought have emphasized&#13;
these needs. Hydrological activities inAfghanistan ceased between 1978-80. Historical data are, therefore&#13;

only available until 1978, some until 1980, but they are not likely to be representative o f current&#13;
conditions due to possible climatic changes inthe past 25 years.&#13;
&#13;
27.      Scope of Rehabilitation needs: A total o f 167 hydrological stations were installed all over the&#13;
country between 1940 and 1975 (see Appendix 8).             As a result, the technology used until the late&#13;
seventies for operating the observation network was that o f the fifties and sixties. Nevertheless, a dense&#13;
system o f simple hydrological measurement stations, combined with meteorological stations, was&#13;
maintained for more than 30 years. Inaddition, an agro-meteorological network was and i s managed by&#13;
the Ministry o f Agriculture, assisted by the Meteorology Department o f MAT. Each regional office in&#13;
Kunduz, Kandahar, Kabul, and Herat was also equipped with a laboratory suitable for the analysis o f&#13;
sediment samples taken from rivers and streams for the purpose o f quantifying their bed and wash load.&#13;
Today, only some civil engineering works such as the shafts o f the float for measuring water levels or&#13;
empty meteorological stations are left, all hydro-meteorological equipment having been lost or destroyed.&#13;
&#13;
28.      The objectives o f the proposed hydro-meteorological observation network i s to provide accurate&#13;
data for analysis, such as (i)  water resources assessment (inone o f the most important headwater areas o f&#13;
Central Asia); (ii)   water resources management (sustainable and equitable water use); (iii)      watershed&#13;
management (integrated and participatory);          (iv) drought mitigation planning (preparedness and&#13;
monitoring); (v) design o f irrigation systems, dams, hydropower and (road) bridge projects (water yield&#13;
and variability drought and flood frequencies); (vi) optimization o f reservoir operation (water availability,&#13;
sedimentation, and flood forecasting); (vii) snow cover and glacier assessment (forecasting o f water&#13;
availability and floods); and (viii) monitoring o f trends caused by climate and land-use changes.&#13;
&#13;
29.      MIWRE staff has confirmed that all the hydrological stations are out of order and their water&#13;
level recorders and staff gauges damaged or removed. With a few exceptions, such as change o f river&#13;
course or accumulation of large amount o f sediments, the existing gauging sites can be rehabilitated and&#13;
used again.     The reconstruction o f the historical gauging stations i s essential in order to establish&#13;
correlations with the available long-term data series and new measurements reflectingpossible changes in&#13;
flow volume andpattern.&#13;
&#13;
30.      Hydro-meteorological network to be rehabilitated: In a mountain area like Afghanistan, a&#13;
relatively dense observation network o f hydro-meteorological stations is required in order to assess the&#13;
variability o f water resources.     The project i s expected to finance the rehabilitation o f about 160&#13;
hydrological stations, 25 o f them prepared and equipped for sediment transport measurements. This&#13;
includes a large part o f the historical 167 stations, but also some new sites filling the obvious gaps for&#13;
planned reservoirs and irrigation schemes. Additionally, 30 snow measurement stations and 30 rainfall&#13;
recorders are proposed to be installedat selected locations, and a total o f 30 meteorological stations which&#13;
include six key stations ineach o f the five river basins. Though all stations will be equipped with state-of-&#13;
the-art equipment, special attention will be given to select reliable and robust equipment, which i s not&#13;
only adapted to the country's extreme (heat and dust) climatic conditions, but also easy to handle and&#13;
maintain.&#13;
&#13;
31.      As the project will set standards for a national hydro-meteorological observation network in&#13;
Afghanistan, equipment and data analyses has to comply with international standards. To ensure optimum&#13;
reliability o f data collection, a double data acquisition system i s envisaged, including (i)state-of-the-art&#13;
automatic data collection with data loggers; and (ii)   daily manual readings by observers, which will serve&#13;
as backup, if the recording system failed. Care has been taken to use few different technologies only, in&#13;
order to reduce training requirements, to simplify the management o f spare parts, and to make sure that&#13;
out-of-function instruments can be replaced quickly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32.      Cable ways have to be installed wherever accurate measurements from a bridge are not possible.&#13;
Current meter equipment in sufficient quantities i s requiredfor each o f the five Regional Centers. Intotal,&#13;
15 current meter sets for wading and suspended flow measurements, respectively, are proposed to be&#13;
procured. Additionally, some 15 mini-current meters are intended to be used for discharge measurements&#13;
o f springs and irrigation canals, and six portable winches and jibs for discharge measurements from&#13;
bridges or from boats. Inareas where cableways are not feasible to be installed, a total o f five boats, one&#13;
per Regonal Centre, will be procured.&#13;
&#13;
33.      Manual data transfer by technical staff o f MIWREwill ensure reliable data acquisition. This does&#13;
not cause additional operations cost as regular visits to the gauging sites are required for: (i)   discharge&#13;
measurements, and (ii)   control o f the overall function o f the hydrological station (such as sedimentation&#13;
problems and battery status.). As the use o f notebook computers in the field i s not feasible, the use o f&#13;
dedicated field storage devices (interfaces) for data read-out and transport to the office are proposed.&#13;
These devices should preferably be procured from the same supplier as the data loggers (water level&#13;
recorders) to ensure hardware and software compatibility.&#13;
&#13;
34.      A data tele-transmission system is needed for stations that are not accessible throughout the year,&#13;
such as snow stations, and for hydro-meteorological stations used for real-time flood forecasting. The&#13;
latter i s crucial for Afghanistan's rivers o f torrential character causing annual flood damages o f&#13;
considerable magnitude. Because o f the remote locations and the innovative character o f any tele-&#13;
transmission system to be installed in Afghanistan, it is recommended to chose a well-established system,&#13;
where all components have been tested to be compatible and suitable for reliable long-termoperation. The&#13;
system using meteor burst technology i s such a system. The installationcosts o f a meteor burst system are&#13;
relatively high (approximately 20% more than those o f a satellite based transmission system), but&#13;
recurrent costs for communication are low.&#13;
&#13;
35.      Some 100 o f the former hydro-meteorological sites, including meteorological and agro-&#13;
meteorological stations must be visited, and some 60 o f the key hydro-meteorological stations selected&#13;
and surveyed. This survey has to be given a priority, as its outcome determines the specifications o f the&#13;
proposed equipment. All equipment should then be procured, and at least half the number (30) o f stations&#13;
re-established and made operational before the onset o f the rains infall 2004, ifpossible. Parallelto these&#13;
works, training courses for the selected hydrological teams, technicians and observers will be given in a&#13;
variety o f subjects, such as hydrometric and meteorological basics as well as flow measurements, data&#13;
collection and analyses, and calibration o fmeasurement devices and gauging sites.&#13;

Component C: Preparationof FeasibilityStudiesand Monitoring (US$5 million)&#13;
&#13;
C.1 Preparationof FeasibilityStudies&#13;
&#13;
36.      Due to climatic conditions, most rivers in Afghanistan have their peak flow in the spring and&#13;
early summer, and often they do not have water during late summer and early fall. Almost all rivers and&#13;
their tributaries experience flooding o f considerable magnitude during spring, resulting in substantial&#13;
collateral damage. In addition, the current energy consumption inAfghanistan i s one o f the lowest in the&#13;
world. Total installed capacity for electricity generation i s extremely low, although there i s a great&#13;
potential for hydropower generation. Almost all o f the river flow in Afghanistan i s unregulated and the&#13;
water utilization rate by Afghanistan i s only about 30%. About 99% o f all water i s used for irrigation&#13;
purposes, few rivers are used for hydropower generation, for potable water supply and sanitary&#13;
requirements or for commercial purposes. None o f them provides guaranteedbase flow for environmental&#13;
purposes. Clearly, with the regulation o f river flow, a better utilization o f the surface and groundwater&#13;
resources can be achieved to help in overall economic development o f the country. Thus, multi-purpose&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
use o f water i s one o f the keys to overcome current problems o f poverty, food shortage and economic&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;
37.      Presentsituationand scope of needs: Until 1979 and duringthe 1980s, a number o f large-scale&#13;
multi-purpose irrigation projects were studied and many o f them were started. However, only few were&#13;
completed (or almost completed like KhanabadiKunduz), and what was built has been either partially&#13;
(Nangahar) or totally (Helmand) destroyed. Construction sites o f important dams (e.g. Salma dam on the&#13;
upper Har-i Rud) were completely looted, others left in disorder (e.g. spillway o f Kajakai dam). Even&#13;
large traditional irrigation schemes such as the Hish-dah-re Nahr in Balkh province suffered fkom&#13;
unfinished interventions, superimposed by the negative impact o f conflict on water and land rights. There&#13;
i s much interest by many donors - particularly those who funded the projects before 1978 - to assist the&#13;
Government incompleting these projects. A number o f feasibility studies have already been done (such as&#13;
the Parwan irrigation scheme supplying the Shomali plain situated North o f Kabul), or are in progress&#13;
(such as the Salma dam project).&#13;
&#13;
38.      Scope and type of feasibility studies: In order to address the urgent need, feasibility or pre-&#13;
feasibility studies o f a number o f large irrigation schemes involvingpermanent diversion structures and/or&#13;
multi-purpose storage expected to be prepared under the project. This will consist o f (i)studies to&#13;
complete unfinished structures/schemes;         (ii)studies to update existing feasibility studies; and (iii)&#13;
feasibility studies for identified potential dam sites o f multi-purpose character. All the potential projects&#13;
will be ranked according to priority and prepared for implementation ina possible follow-up project that&#13;
may be funded by the World Bank or other donors. Selection criteria for feasibility or pre-feasibility&#13;
studies, to be included in the project, are (i)balanced geographical distribution; (ii)      likely substantial&#13;
economic impact; (iii)     large number and clearly identifiable beneficiaries; (iv) mitigation o f negative&#13;
environmental and social impact; and (v) increase o f water reliability/availability for irrigation purposes,&#13;
hydropower generation and potable water supply. A preliminary list o f possible projects for feasibility or&#13;
pre-feasibility studies, to be includedinthis project, i s given inAppendix 9.&#13;
&#13;
39.      Inaddition, the projectwill also finance selected andhighpriority strategic studies that maybe&#13;
considered critical to bridge the knowledge gap for improving the efficiency o f the irrigation system and&#13;
for sustainable management o f national water resources. All pre-feasibility, feasibility and strategic&#13;
studies will be prepared by an International Consulting Firmhaving proven experience o f multi-purpose&#13;
hydraulic project design and implementation in the country or inneighboring countries. New studies o f&#13;
potential project sites have to be carried out only after a consensus has been reached between MrWRE&#13;
and the Word Bank about a favorable outcome o f the pre-feasibility study. The pre-feasibility study must&#13;
provide sufficient evidence that the feasibility study will prove the potential project to be economically,&#13;
socially and environmentally feasible.&#13;
&#13;
C.2 Monitoring andEvaluation&#13;
&#13;
40.      The monitoring and evaluation framework for the project i s outlined in Appendix 10. The&#13;
selected International Consulting Firm for preparing feasibility studies will also be responsible for&#13;
monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) aspects o f the project. The information collected as part o f M&amp;E will&#13;
also feed into the preparation o f pre-feasibility, feasibility or strategic studies. Furthermore, M&amp;E work&#13;
by the International Consulting Firm will provide an independent source o f information related to the&#13;
status, speed and quality of project implementationby MIWRE,with support fkom FAO. Further details&#13;
on the selected monitoring indicators are provided inTable 2.&#13;

ComponentD: InstitutionalDevelopment(US$lO million)&#13;
&#13;
D.1: InstitutionalStrengthening.&#13;
&#13;
41.      The institutional strengthening i s sub-divided into three sub-components, namely (i)         human&#13;
resources development (HRD); (ii)     office rehabilitationand refurbishing, and (iii)provision o f office and&#13;
communication equipment. HRD i s very crucial because it i s the professional staff o f MIWREwho will&#13;
be responsible for the implementation o f the various project activities. There i s a good knowledge base&#13;
among MrWRE staff. However, there are also large knowledge gaps among the staff who could not&#13;
benefit from the technical progress and knowledge generated in the last 25 years. During the last 15&#13;
years, MIWRE office facilities located all over the country have been damaged, stripped o f the&#13;
equipment, and most o f the documents burned or stolen. Any type o f irrigation rehabilitation work also&#13;
requires MIWRE presence at provincial level in all five regions.          Professional competence and an&#13;
adequate worlung environment at the regional level, and field presence at provincial level, i s essential to&#13;
deliver the required services to the potentialbeneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
42.      Human Resources Development: Most o f the professional MIWRE staff need on-the-job&#13;
training as well as intensive courses in a variety o f engineering subjects. This i s essential for producing&#13;
future specialists in managing national water resources and irrigation development for the country . In&#13;
addition to on-the-job training, there i s a need for organizing structured courses and progress as part o f&#13;
practical training and possibly academic training in water resources engineering, and in irrigation&#13;
development and management. Several short courses should also be organized for MIWRE staff. The&#13;
subjects covered will be civil engineering basics (e.g. material, mechanics, hydraulics), agricultural&#13;
engineering (e.g. irrigation, drainage, soils, erosion), and water resources engineering (e.g. water balance,&#13;
hydrometrics, instruments, data transfer, modeling).      The courses should preferably be given in Dari&#13;
and/or Pashtu by national (English spealung) professional staff, who have been given a refresher course&#13;
by international consultants specialized inthe different subjects.&#13;
&#13;
43.      Office rehabilitationand refurbishing: Inorder to accommodate all MIWREstaffrequired in&#13;
the Regional Centers for the identification, survey, design and implementation of irrigation schemes,&#13;
sufficient office space has to be provided for professional MIWRE staff per Regional Center, and for&#13;
staff for the MIWREitself. Additionally, depending on the respective locations o f the irrigation schemes&#13;
to be rehabilitated, some o f the critical provincial MIWRE sub-offices may have to be rehabilitated and&#13;
refurbished. The project will support the rehabilitationo f offices situated inKabul, Mazar-i Sharif, Herat,&#13;
Jalalabad, Kandahar, Kunduz and possibly, Bamyan and Paktia. Other donors, particularly ADB and EU,&#13;
are also interestedinrehabilitating some o f the regional offices.&#13;
&#13;
44.      Provision of office and communicationequipment: A detailed list o f the required office and&#13;
communication equipment i s under preparation by MIWRE staff. The items to be procured comprise not&#13;
only computers and accessories, copy machines, mobile telephones, internet facilities and office furniture,&#13;
but also power supply (diesel generators) for the central and regional offices as well as equipment for&#13;
reconnaissance, topographic surveys and engineering designs.&#13;
&#13;
D.2. ProjectManagement&#13;
&#13;
45.      This sub-component will support and provide technical assistance to the Program Coordination&#13;
Unit (PCU) that is being established inMIWRE. The project will be managed and implemented by the&#13;
PCU, with support from FAO. It is expected that the PCU will also coordinate all donor activities related&#13;
to irrigation and development o f national water resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Sustainability&#13;
&#13;
46.      About 90% o f the irrigation system in Afghanistan i s traditional (non-formal) and the remaining&#13;
10% is modem (formal).          The traditional irrigation system has always been managed, including&#13;
operations and maintenance, by the centuries-old system o f community water organizations, consisting o f&#13;
Mirabs andAshar. Duringthe last 25 years o f conflict, the effectiveness o f this system has beenreduced&#13;
substantially. One o f the objectives o f this project is to strengthen these community water organizations.&#13;
These community water organizations or local water users associations will also be actively involved in&#13;
both the rehabilitation and operations and maintenance, contributing interms of both ideas and resources.&#13;
This approach is likely to reduce dependence on government and ensure sustainability of the irrigation&#13;
schemes that will be rehabilitated under the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   D. PROJECTIMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OrganizationalStructure&#13;
&#13;
47.      The overall organizational structure for implementing the project i s summarized inFigure 1. The&#13;
Ministry of Imgation,         Water Resources and Environment (MIWRE) would have the overall&#13;
responsibility for project execution and implementation. The MIWRE, with branches at the five to seven&#13;
river basin regional offices, Wilayat (province) and some at the Woluswali (district) level, i s responsible&#13;
for all rehabilitation o f irrigation schemes, national water resources planning and O&amp;M o f the main&#13;
irrigation and drainage schemes. The MIWREalso administers international river systems with respect to&#13;
water sharing and water quality control. Within the MTWRE, the Deputy Minister for Imgation would&#13;
have the overall responsibility for the project and for liaison with other ministries, in particular the&#13;
MinistryofAgriculture andAnimal Husbandry (MAAH)and other concernedgovernment agencies.&#13;
&#13;
48.      Inthe MIWRE,ProgramCoordinationUnit(PCU) will be established that will be responsible for&#13;
coordination of all donor activities, including individual project implementationactivities. The PCU will&#13;
be responsible for the overall project management, including technical/engineering design, construction&#13;
supervision,   financial management,       procurement,      disbursement,    monitoring and    institutional&#13;
development. The PCU will consist o f a Director who will be supported by a small group of technical&#13;
and administrative staff inKabul (see Figure 1 for more details). The PCU would maintain five regional&#13;
offices, one each in Kandahar, Herat, Mazar-e-Sharif, Kunduz and Jalalabad. In addition, MIWRE i s&#13;
planning to establish regional offices in Bamiyan and Paktia. Each regional office would be staffed with&#13;
similar positions. The provincial distribution and coverage by each o f the central office and the regional&#13;
offices o fMIWREare providedbelow.&#13;

49.      The PCU would be assisted by a group o f international consultants provided under the FA0&#13;
contract   in the areas of irrigation engineering, hydrology, procurement, financial management and&#13;
institutional development as well as national consultants (see Appendix 11for details). The PCU will be&#13;
organized into four groups:&#13;
&#13;
             Technical Group (TG), consisting o f about five staff, in the areas o f survey, design, quality&#13;
             control, hydrology, social and environment. The technical group would provide support to the&#13;
             MIWRE's survey and design office, that will have a central role in the project rehabilitation&#13;
             works; the quality control team which will be involved in construction supervision; the&#13;
             hydrology department which will have the primary responsibility for rehabilitation o f&#13;
             hydrological observation network.&#13;
&#13;
             Procurement Group (PG) would consist o f three staff (procurement specialist and two&#13;
             procurement analysts) and would be responsible for the procurement o f works, good and&#13;
             services under the project.&#13;
&#13;
             Financial Management Group (FMG) would consist o f three staff (financial management&#13;
             specialist and two book keepedcashiers). The FMG would be responsible for malung&#13;
             payments, financial management, maintenance o f the accounts and project audits.&#13;
&#13;
             InstitutionalDevelopment Group (IDG) would consist o f three staff and would be responsible&#13;
             for institutional strengthening, support to the regional offices, strengthening o f the MIWRE&#13;
             staff and strengthening o f community water users' organizations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ImplementationProcedures&#13;
&#13;
50.      Monitoring and Evaluation Consultants: For monitoring project impacts (physical, economic,&#13;
environmental and social), an independent consulting firm (also responsible for preparing the feasibility&#13;
studies), under the Ministry o f Irrigation, Water Resources and Environment would be recruited. This&#13;
group would consist o f about 5 technical consultants in the areas o f irrigation engineering, hydrology,&#13;
agricultural economics, environment, and sociology. The monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) unit will be&#13;
established inthe Ministrybut will not be part o f the PCU.&#13;
&#13;
51.      Design, Supervision and Management Consultants: The PCU and the affiliated regional&#13;
offices would be assisted by a team o f national and international consultants (FAO) for detailed&#13;
engineering design and construction supervision o f all irrigation schemes. The responsibilities include&#13;
detailed engineering survey and design, preparation o f biddingdocumentdrequest for proposals, assisting&#13;
                                                     14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
in the pre-bid and pre-proposal conferences, evaluation of bid and proposals, contract award,&#13;
administration, management, supervision, quality control and certification. The consultants would serve&#13;
as the "engineer" during the construction period. Under this contract, an international hydrologist would&#13;
be recruited to oversee the site investigation, preparation o f equipment specifications, equipment&#13;
installation and training of the staff under the rehabilitation o f hydrological stations component o f the&#13;
project. Furthermore, consultant would be responsible for the preparation and implementation o f training&#13;
programs for strengthening institutional capacity o f the Ministry's staff.&#13;
&#13;
52.      Project Steering Committee (PSC): A national steering committee would be established to&#13;
provide supervision and overall guidance for water resources management and to coordinate project&#13;
activities at the highest level, including inter-ministerial level. The PSC will also review the project&#13;
monitoring and evaluation reports submitted by the project and M&amp;E consultants, and recommend&#13;
remedial actions when project implementation problems occur.           The PSC would be chaired by the&#13;
Minister o f Irrigation, Water Resources and Environment, its Secretary would be the PCU Director, and&#13;
its members will be the representatives from Ministries o f Finance, Agriculture and Animal Husbandry,&#13;
and Irrigation, Water Resources and Environment, and the Heads o f the RegionalMIWREDepartments.&#13;
&#13;
53.      Regional Coordination Committee (RCC): The RCCs will be established in each the five to&#13;
seven regional offices to supervise and coordinate project implementation in the five river basins. The&#13;
RCCs would coordinate the implementation o f the project, review and monitor the project progress, and&#13;
recommend necessary actions when project implementation problems occur. The RCCs would consist o f&#13;
local representatives o f MIWRE, MAAH, representatives o f local authorities at the provincial level and&#13;
farmers. The RCCs would be chaired by the Head o f the Regional MIWREDepartment and the Secretary&#13;
would be the PCUDeputy Director of that regional PCU.&#13;
&#13;
54.      Project Duration: Project implementationis anticipated to take about three years from April 01,&#13;
2004 to March 31, 2007. The mid-term review o f the project i s expected to be in September 2005. The&#13;
Credit Closing would be September 30,2007.&#13;
&#13;
55.       Reporting: The PCU would submit quarterly reports, in the Bank provided format, to the&#13;
MIWRE,the PSC and the Bank, no later than three weeks after the end of each quarter. The quarterly&#13;
reports would cover project M&amp;E activities, the progress and expected completion date for civil works&#13;
and equipment/goods contracts, progress on institutional components, training and studies, and activities&#13;
o f the PCU's engineering, procurement, financial management and institutional development consultants.&#13;
The quarterly reports' formats will cover financial and procurement information, including (a)&#13;
comparison o f actual physical and financial outputs with forecasts, and updated six-months project&#13;
forecast; (b) project financial statements, including sources and application o f funds, expenditures by&#13;
category statement, and special account reconciliation statement; and (c) procurement management&#13;
reports, showing status and contract commitments.&#13;
&#13;
56.       The PCU will also submit annual reports to MIWRE, the PSC and the Bank by no later than&#13;
January 31 o f each year o f project implementation. The report will contain the following two sections:&#13;
Annual Progress Report and Annual Work Plan: (i)     The Annual Progress Report would cover the progress&#13;
o f each component, key performance indicators, operation o f project facilities, and financial statements.&#13;
(ii) Annual WorkPlanwouldcontainaplan for implementation, updateddisbursement profile,&#13;
     The&#13;
planned actions for mitigating negative effects during construction, and target indicators for the coming&#13;
year.&#13;
&#13;
57.      Implementation Monitoring: The two main aspects o f project implementation monitoring&#13;
would be physical and financial performance. The monitoring plan would include performance indicators&#13;
that will be used to track progress made towards achieving project objectives, outcomes, outputs, and&#13;
                                                     15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
inputs. The PCU would submit to MIWRE,the PSC andthe Bank a semi-annual performance review (as&#13;
part o f quarterly report) by July 31, and January 31, each year. The Bank and the Government would&#13;
conduct joint reviews annually during supervision missions. A mid-termreview o f the project would be&#13;
undertaken in September 2005. An ImplementationCompletion Report (ICR) would be submitted to the&#13;
Bankno later than six months after the closing date.&#13;
&#13;
ProcurementArrangements&#13;
&#13;
58.      Procurement Guidelines: The procurement o f works and goods financed by the Bank would be&#13;
carried out inaccordance with the World Bank Guidelines: Procurement under the IBRD Grants and IDA&#13;
Credits (issued in January 1995, revised January and August 1996, September 1997, and January 1999).&#13;
Consulting Services, technical assistance and training will be procured in accordance with the Guidelines&#13;
- Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, January 1997, revised September&#13;
1997 and January 1999 and M a y 2002. The Bank's Standard BiddingDocuments, Request for Proposals&#13;
and Forms o f Consultants' Contract will be used. In case o f conflict between the Bank's procurement&#13;
procedures and any national rules and regulations, the Bank's procurement procedures would take&#13;
precedence. A General Procurement Notice (GPN) was published in the Development Business on&#13;
September 29,2003.&#13;
&#13;
59.      Procurement Responsibility: The PCUinthe MIWREwould have the overall responsibility for&#13;
procurement under the project with the assistance o f the Govemment's Central Procurement Consultant&#13;
(i.e. Crown Agents, at present). The procurement procedures and procurement plan for the project are&#13;
developed keeping in view the public procurement environment in the country. Therefore, to minimize&#13;
risks, the Food and Agnculture Organization o f the United Nations (FAO) has been selected, on sole&#13;
source basis, to provide support to MrWRE in project management, scheme preparation, engineering&#13;
design, construction supervision, procurement, and financial management, and institutional development.&#13;
&#13;
60.      Procurement Review: The threshold levels for prior review have been adopted, keeping inview&#13;
the procurement capacity and emergency nature of the project.           Prior review threshold and the&#13;
procurement plan are summarized in Appendix 2. All Bank-financed contracts, which are not subject to&#13;
prior review, would be subject to Bank's ex-post review.&#13;
&#13;
61.      Works: T he World Bank Standard BiddingDocuments would be used for all procurement for&#13;
civil works.    The contracts for small irrigation schemes costing less than US$lOO,OOO would be&#13;
implementedthrough (i)    Direct Contracting (DC) to community organizations or qualified NGOs; or (ii)&#13;
awarding the contracts to qualified domestic contractors after invitingprice quotations from at least three&#13;
qualified local contractors.   In addition, rehabilitation works for office buildings costing less than&#13;
US$lOO,OOO each would be implemented by following procurement procedures defined in (i)            or (ii)&#13;
above. The works for the medium irrigation schemes costing not more than US$500,000 each contract&#13;
would be procured through the National Competitive Bidding (NCB). The works for large irrigation&#13;
schemes costing more than US$500,000 would be procured through ICBprocedures.&#13;
&#13;
62.      Goods:    Goods estimated to cost less than US$200,000 or equivalent per contract may be&#13;
procured through Intemational/National Shopping (IS/NS).     Goods estimated to cost less than US$lO,OOO&#13;
or equivalent per contract shall be procuredthrough Direct Contracting (DC). Other than this, goods shall&#13;
be procured through Intemational Competitive Bidding(ICB).&#13;
&#13;
63.      Services:  FA0 would serve as the main Engineering Design, Construction Supervision and&#13;
Project Management Consultants.        FA0 would use MIWRE staff, and national and international&#13;
consultants in carrying out these responsibilities and provide institutional strengthening and on-the-job&#13;
training. The consulting services for monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) and preparationo f feasibility, pre-&#13;
                                                    16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
feasibility or strategic studies would be recruited usingthe Quality Based Selection (QBS) procedure. The&#13;
consultants for Auditing services would be recruited under the Quality-and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS)&#13;
procedures.&#13;
&#13;
FinancialManagementandAudit&#13;
&#13;
64.      The Transitional Islamic State o f Afghanistan will be the Borrower o f the Credit. The project&#13;
would be implemented by the MIWRE. Further details related to financial management, disbursement&#13;
and audit are provided inAppendix 3.&#13;
&#13;
65.      Financing Plan: The proposed IDA Credit o f US$40 million equivalent and a Co-financing&#13;
Grant o f US$35 million equivalent would finance 100% o f the total financing required for the project.&#13;
Co-financing Grant funds would be used to finance separate and identifiable works for the rehabilitation&#13;
of small and medium irrigation schemes and the preparation o f feasibility studies for future large multi-&#13;
purpose irrigation schemes and monitoring. Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that all&#13;
contracts executed under the project, goods supplied, and services provided would be exempt from taxes&#13;
and duties levied by Government o f Afghanistan (GOA). Taxes and duties, if any, would be financed by&#13;
GOA.&#13;
&#13;
66.      Retroactive Financing: Provision has been made to reimburse the Government o f Afghanistan&#13;
for payments it makes, up to a maximum o f USD 8 million (SDR 5.6 million) up to a maximum o f 4&#13;
months before the credit signing for eligible project expenditures subject to Bank's procurement and&#13;
financial management guidelines. To clarify, as per the Bank's guidelines on emergency operations, any&#13;
project expenditure paid prior to the four months to the credit signing date, and more than 20% o f the&#13;
credit amount cannot be claimed as retroactive finance.&#13;
&#13;
67.      Financial Management System: While MIWREwill have the overall responsibility for project&#13;
implementation, the responsibility for day-to-day project implementation i s delegated to the PCU and the&#13;
PCU Director. The PCU's financial management system (FMS) i s under preparation and would be&#13;
completed prior to the project startup.&#13;
&#13;
68.      Financial Reporting: The PCU will maintain a financial management system, including books&#13;
and accounts for the project, adequate to reflect the operations, resources and expenditures related to the&#13;
project. The PCU will prepare quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) as well as financial&#13;
statements for the Project inaccordance with formats agreed with the Bank. FMRs, to be generated fkom&#13;
the computerized accounting system, will include the following: (a) Financial Reports; (b) Physical&#13;
Progress Reports; and (c) Procurement Management Reports. These financial reports will be submitted to&#13;
the Bank within 45 days o f the end of each quarter. The first FMR shall be fumished to the Association&#13;
not later than 45 days after the end of the first calendar quarter after the Effective Date, and shall cover&#13;
the period from the incurrence o f the first expenditure under the Project through the end o f such first&#13;
calendar quarter; thereafter, each FMR shall be fumished to the Association not later than 45 days after&#13;
each subsequent calendar quarter, and shall cover such calendar quarter.&#13;
&#13;
69.      Disbursement: Disbursements fkom the IDA Credit will use transaction based methods (i.e.,&#13;
from the Special Account with replenishments made based on Statements o f Expenditures (SOEs) and full&#13;
documentation, direct payments from the Credit Account, special commitments and a blanket withdrawal&#13;
application in favor o f FAO. To facilitate timely project implementation, the Borrower will establish,&#13;
maintain and operate, under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, a separate Special Account&#13;
(SA) to be opened in D a Afghanistan Bank (Central Bank o f Afghanistan).       The SA would be managed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
by the Ministry o f Finance. Special Account replenishment requests would be submitted to the Bank&#13;
monthly or when the account i s drawn down by 40%, whichever occurs first.&#13;
&#13;
70.      Flow of Funds: Credit funds will be deposited ina Special Dollar Account (SDA) to be opened&#13;
and maintainedat the D a Afghanistan Bank (DAB). The SA authorized allocation will be US$2.5 million&#13;
representing an average o f expenditures for three months. The SDA, inkeepingwith current practices for&#13;
other projects inAfghanistan, will be operated by the Grants Management Unit (GMU) inthe Ministryo f&#13;
Finance. Requests for payments out o f SDA funds will be made to the GMUby the MWREaccording to&#13;
procedures specified inthe "Documentation Guidelines", dated June 01,2003. Inaddition to payment out&#13;
o f SDA funds, MIWRE could also request the GMU to request IDA to make direct payments to&#13;
contractors, consultants, UNagencies, and to issue special commitments for contracts covered by letters&#13;
o f credit. Such requests too should follow the procedures specified in the "Documentation Guidelines".&#13;
Where project payments are for local contractors based outside Kabul, there activities will be covered&#13;
under the UN Agencies' contract, whereby, responsibility for funds transfer will be with the concerned&#13;
UNAgency.&#13;
&#13;
71.      Use of Statement of Expenditures: Loan proceeds would be disbursed against statement o f&#13;
expenditures (SOEs) for: (a) civil works contracts costing less than US$300,000 equivalent; (b) goods,&#13;
equipment and vehicles contracts costing less than US$lOO,OOO; (c) consulting firms contracts costing&#13;
less than US$lOO,OOO; (d) individual consultants contracts for less than US$50,000; and (e) training and&#13;
incremental operating expenditures. All other contracts would be fully documented. Requests for SOEs&#13;
should be submitted to the Bank, at least monthly. Supporting documentation for SOEs would be retained&#13;
by the PCUMIWRE and made available to World Bank staff duringsupervision and to external auditors&#13;
or as requested.&#13;
&#13;
72.      Audit Arrangements: The annual accounts o f the project will be audited by the Auditor&#13;
General, with the support o f the Audit Agent, with terms o f reference satisfactory to IDA. The annual&#13;
Project financial statement to IDA would include a summary o f funds received (showing funds received&#13;
from all sources), and a summary of expenditures shown under the main Project components/activities&#13;
and by main categories o f expenditures. It should also disclose statement o f financial affairs at the end o f&#13;
the year and all major accounting policies used in preparing the statement. The annual audited Project&#13;
financial statements would be submitted within six months o f the close o f the fiscal year i.e. by&#13;
September 22 o f each year.&#13;
&#13;
                        E. FINANCIALAND ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION&#13;
&#13;
ProjectRationale&#13;
&#13;
73.      The main issue facing the policy makers i s how to transform the poorly performing subsistence&#13;
agricultural sector into a modem, dynamic and sustainable rural economy that provides food security,&#13;
generates farm income, reduces vulnerability and expands livelihood opportunities. Lack o f assured and&#13;
timely water supply at the farm-level through the existing irrigation system appears to be one o f the most&#13;
important constraints to food production, agricultural growth and rural development. This problem has&#13;
worsened in the last 25 years o f conflict, neglect, floods and droughts. There i s a substantial scope for&#13;
improving the quality (timely delivery) and expanding the quantity (area under assured irrigation) o f&#13;
imgation, thereby reducing vulnerability to droughts. Management o f water resources in Afghanistan i s&#13;
also constrained by the lack of accurate and up-to-date hydro-meteorological        information (the latest&#13;
information i s 25 years old) for proper planning, development, use and management o f national water&#13;
resources.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
74.      The National Development Framework (NDF, April 2002) recognizes the economic importance&#13;
o f both agriculture and irrigation in transforming the rural economy, improving food security, reducing&#13;
vulnerability and expanding livelihood opportunities for the rural population. In addition, NDF also&#13;
recognizes that rivers are amongst the most important natural resources o f the country and that the water&#13;
resources are to be used inthe most environmentally and socially sustainable manner. This aim has come&#13;
into sharp focus inthe past few years because o f the droughts experienced by Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
75.      The project provides an emergency response to the Government's request for rehabilitating the&#13;
national irrigation system in priority locations in all the 5 river basins o f Afghanistan, for improving the&#13;
hydro-meteorological information base for national water resources, and for supporting institutional&#13;
development for agencies dealing with irrigation and national water resources. The project is consistent&#13;
with the objectives outlined in the Government's National Development Framework (NDF, April 2002)&#13;
and World Bank's Transitional Support Strategy (TSS, March 2003) for Afghanistan. The project is&#13;
expected to improve livelihood in the rural areas by providing assured irrigation water supply, improving&#13;
water resource management, increasing agricultural production and creating rural employment.&#13;
&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
&#13;
76.     To determine economic benefits o f the project, an analysis based on a comprehensive cropping&#13;
pattern is not feasible at present, as reliable data on production o f all the crops grown inAfghanistan are&#13;
not available. However, since wheat is the dominant primary crop in all parts o f the country, an analysis&#13;
was carried out to determine the impact o f water availability, made possible by improved irrigation, on&#13;
the production o f wheat inall the eight ago-climatic regions o f the country. A positive rate o f retum for&#13;
wheat, as a result of implementationo fproject activities, i s an important indicator for a positive impact o f&#13;
the project on the production o f all agriculturalcrops inthe country. This i s especially true since, interms&#13;
of financial retums, wheat i s the least valued crop and orchards are the most valuable.&#13;
&#13;
77.      The major project benefits         come from increased agncultural production resulting form&#13;
availability o f a reliable source o f water for irrigation. At present, fi-om a total 2.30 million ha o f irrigated&#13;
land traditionally under wheat production, only 1.06 million ha i s currently being irrigated fully, and the&#13;
remaining area not being irrigated, either kept as fallow land or cultivated as rainfed. The present status&#13;
o f wheat productionby regions inthe country i s summarized inTable 3.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
78.     The incremental agricultural benefits come from increased yields in the irrigated areas, an&#13;
increase in irrigated land, and, where climatic conditions allow, an increase in cropping intensity.&#13;
Assumptions regarding increase in yields are based on the size o f the farms in various agro-climatic&#13;
&#13;
                                                         19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
regions. The analysis assumes that small size farms would have the largest increase in yields because&#13;
with water availability, the seeding rate, labor input, fertilizer inputs will increase more on small farms&#13;
than on the large farms. The available FA0 data in Afghanistan indicates that the seeding rate for the&#13;
large farms is about 30kg/ha, whereas for small farms it i s 70-170kgha. Therefore, the small farms do&#13;
not need to buy more seeds as compared to the large farms, and the same i s true for fertilizer use. In&#13;
addition, the empirical evidence in other countries also shows that small farms are relatively more&#13;
efficient and would have larger increase inyields as compared to large farms. The analysis assumes the&#13;
following (Table 4) yield increases for various farm sizes inresponse to improvedwater availability:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     Table4 :Firmsize andWheat YieldIncreaseAssumptions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
79.      Furthermore, the analysis assumes, on average, a 20% increase in irrigated land i.e. that i s&#13;
conversion o f 20% o f the rain-fed areas into irrigated area. This i s consistent with the historic data that&#13;
suggest a much larger irrigated area. And finally, the analysis assumes US$200/ha as the cost for&#13;
rehabilitation o f the irrigated areas and US$400ha as the cost for rehabilitation o fthe rain-fed areas. This&#13;
i s based on detailed surveys in the country and experience from other countries in the region. On the&#13;
basis o f these assumptions, the internal rates o f retum (IRRs) in various agro-climatic regions for wheat&#13;
are summarized inTable 5 below:&#13;

                Average for the country                                   31&#13;
&#13;
80.      The analysis indicates that irrigation rehabilitation i s economically viable, even if only wheat i s&#13;
produced, with internal rates o f return ranging from 1746%.          Since farmers also grow other crops,&#13;
particularly orchards, that are much more profitable than wheat, the overall average IRRi s expected to be&#13;
muchhigher than 31%.&#13;
                                                      20&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
81.      In addition to the direct economic benefits from project investments in the rehabilitation o f&#13;
irrigation schemes, the project has three other important benefits that are not quantifiable. First, the&#13;
project will rehabilitate the whole hydro-meteorological network in the country which will generate&#13;
information that i s critical for the planning, development, sustainable use and management o f national&#13;
water resources. The latest hydro-meteorological informationinAfghanistan i s 25 years old. Second, the&#13;
project will build and strengthen human resources and institutions dealing with water in the country,&#13;
including national public sector water institutions and community water organizations. This i s absolutely&#13;
essential for sustainable use and management o f national, community-level and on-farm water resources.&#13;
Third, the project would improve drinking water supply, for both humans and livestock, in the project&#13;
areas all over rural Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
Likely Risks&#13;
&#13;
82.     The project incorporates the lessons learned from the on-going IDA supported projects,&#13;
particularly the lessons with respect to project implementation, procurement arrangements and financial&#13;
management arrangements. However, many risks remain. The likely significant risks and the mitigation&#13;
measures, to address these risks duringimplementationo f the project are, summarized below.&#13;
&#13;
83.      Weak institutional capacity to implement the project will delay the implementation and the&#13;
realization o f project objectives.    This is particularly true in areas related to project management,&#13;
procurement, financial management, disbursement and the payment system. The project will undertake&#13;
the necessary capacitylrisk assessment, will finance training and technical assistance to create and&#13;
strengthen needed s h l l s inthese areas, and will also finance the hiringo f local and expatriate consultants&#13;
to develop institutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
84.     Security situation in the country, particularly in some areas with large number o f irrigation&#13;
schemes requiring rehabilitation, i s very fragile and may discourage both contractors and foreign&#13;
consultants to participate inthe rehabilitationwork. There is very little that this project can do to mitigate&#13;
the security risk. However, the potentially large and visible gains from irrigation rehabilitation work and&#13;
likely employment opportunities for rural population may empower the local communities to take&#13;
necessary actions that may improve the security situation.&#13;
&#13;
85.     Land mines incertain areas (rivers, canals, springs, kerezes) that must be rehabilitatedto improve&#13;
water flow pose a real danger to workers. This risk will be mitigated (may not be completely eliminated)&#13;
by making sure that the areas selected for rehabilitation are certified by the UnitedNations Mine Action&#13;
Center for Afghanistan (MACA).&#13;
&#13;
86.     Misallocation, misuse or ineficient use of funds could be another potentially significant risk since&#13;
the rehabilitation activities will be highly dispersed all over the country and the M           M has limited&#13;
financial management capacity. The project will strengthen financial management capacity o f MIWRE&#13;
and its capacity to regularly monitor the rehabilitation activities duringimplementation. There would also&#13;
be regular financial reporting, accounting and auditing for the project.&#13;
&#13;
87.     Riparian issue o f rivers flowing to the neighboring countries may pose a risk o f delays inproject&#13;
implementation. However, this risk will be addressed by making sure that this "emergency" project deals&#13;
only with the rehabilitationo f existing irrigation schemes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
88.      The selected input and output indicators for the project are outlined in Table 6. The Monitoring&#13;
and Evaluation (M&amp;E) Unit will be established in the MrWRE which will be responsible for all the&#13;
activities related to M&amp;E for this project. Since the M&amp;E unit will not be part o f the PCU (responsible&#13;
for project implementation), it will provide independent information and assessment on the progress o f&#13;
project implementation and its achievements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                      F. ENVIRONMENTALAND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
89.      The project has been determined to have a "B" environment category and "S2" safeguards&#13;
classification. The project observes an updated version o f the Environmental and Social Safeguards&#13;
Framework (see Appendix 7) that has been developed for emergency rehabilitation projects in&#13;
Afghanistan and which i s currently being used in ongoing IDA supported projects. As the investment&#13;
component will only include rehabilitation o f existing schemes, no major environmental and social&#13;
impacts are expected. However, potential impacts will be addressed in the design and implementation o f&#13;
sub-projects mainly through Codes o f Practices that are outlined in the Safeguards Framework. The&#13;
feasibility studies for the rehabilitation o f large irrigation schemes will include a full environmental and&#13;
social assessment, for which Terms o f Reference have been drafted and are available in the Framework.&#13;
The institutional strengthening component will include capacity building for social and environmental&#13;
management, in close collaboration with the efforts currently underway to strengthen the Environmental&#13;
UnitofMIWRE.&#13;
&#13;
90.      Potential Adverse Impacts of Rehabilitation: Potential adverse impacts o f rehabilitation of&#13;
irrigation schemes are restricted to the areas close to the existing infrastructure. Many o f the impacts arise&#13;
from improper drainage and therefore the importance o f providing and maintaining adequate drainage&#13;
cannot be overemphasized. Adverse impacts o f existing irrigation facilities can be traced back to&#13;
ineffective management and maintenance in most cases, and they are likely to be alleviated due to the&#13;
project activities. Potential impacts o f the proposed activities include soil erosion and disposal o f&#13;
construction spoils at the construction stage, and pollution by agrochemicals and impacts on soils&#13;
(waterlogging and salinization) duringoperation.&#13;
&#13;
91.      Safeguard Screening:. The provisions o f the Safeguards Framework will be applied as follows:&#13;
(i) formalassessmentfortherehabilitationofsmallirrigationschemes;(ii) ofPracticeforthe&#13;
    no                                                                               Codes&#13;
rehabilitation o f medium irrigation schemes; (iii)limited environmental assessment (LEA) for the&#13;
rehabilitation o f large irrigation schemes; and (iv) full environmental and social assessment for the&#13;
feasibility studies for large multi-purpose irrigation schemes.          Sub-project proposals for irrigation&#13;
schemes will include documentation on (a) whether and how land donations, if any, have taken place; and&#13;
(b) whether water rights have been clarified with down-stream users, if intake construction is part o f&#13;
scheme rehabilitation. This i s particularly relevant for small irrigation schemes. The selection, design,&#13;
preparation, appraisal, contracting, monitoring and evaluation o f sub-projects will be consistent with the&#13;
guidelines and mitigation measures designed inthe Framework.&#13;
&#13;
92.      Responsibilitiesfor Safeguard Screening and Mitigation: The overall responsibilityo f project&#13;
implementation rests with the PCU in the Ministry o f Imgation, Water Resources and Environment&#13;
(MIWRE), and the FA0 will act as the executing agency for the project. A designated Safeguards Focal&#13;
Officer has been identified with responsibility for overseeing the implementation o f the Environmental&#13;
&#13;

and Social Safeguards Framework within the PCU. An independent Monitoring and Evaluation Unit,&#13;
with inter alia, environmental and social inputs, will also be established withinthe MIWRE.&#13;
&#13;
93.      Capacity Building: As part o fthe capacity building,that will be provided for implementationof&#13;
the project, the Safeguards Focal Officer and relevant staff o f MIRWE will also receive training on&#13;
environmental and social management and in the application o f the Safeguard Framework. It i s also&#13;
proposed that site visits be arranged to other countries in the region, on similar projects in progress to&#13;
provide hands-on training to the staff working as focal points as well as at the PCU. In addition, for&#13;
systematic capacity building, and to provide subsequent guidance and review o f the application o f the&#13;
Framework, MIRWE may contract social and environmental services from specialists.             These may&#13;
initially be housed inthe MIWRE inKabul and carry out field visits to guide line department officials in&#13;
the regions. During supervision of this project, the World Bank will assess the implementation o f the&#13;
Framework, and ifrequired, will recommend additional strengthening.&#13;
&#13;
94.      Consultation and Disclosure: The Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework was&#13;
prepared in consultation with the principal NGOs and development partners participating in&#13;
reconstruction activities in Afghanistan. It has been disclosed by TISA in both Dari and Pashto, as well&#13;
as in English, and it has been made available at the World Bank's Infoshop. The project will support a&#13;
number o f feasibility studies for future investments, for which World Bank safeguard policies relating to&#13;
consultation and disclosure would apply, ifthey are financed by IDA.&#13;

                                     Procurement Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Procurement:&#13;
&#13;
The procurement o f works and goods financed by the Bank would be carried out in accordance with the&#13;
World Bank Guidelines: Procurement under the IBRD Grants and IDA Credits (issued in January 1995,&#13;
revised January and August 1996, September 1997, and January 1999). Consulting Services, technical&#13;
assistance and training will be procuredin accordance with the Guidelines - Selection and Employment of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, January 1997, revised September 1997 and January 1999 and&#13;
May 2002. The Bank`s Standard Bidding Documents, Request for Proposals and Forms o f Consultants'&#13;
Contract will be used for all procurement. Incase o fconflict betweenthe Bank's procurement procedures&#13;
and any national rules and regulations, the Bank's procurement procedures would take precedence. A&#13;
General Procurement Notice (GPN) was publishedinthe Development Business on September 29,2003.&#13;
&#13;
ProcurementResponsibility and Capacityof the ImplementingAgency: The Program Coordination&#13;
Unit(PCU) inthe MIWREwould have the overall responsibilityfor procurement under the project with&#13;
the assistance o f the Govemment's Central Procurement Consultant (i.e. Crown Agents, at present). The&#13;
PCU will have three procurement staff (one Procurement Specialist and two Procurement Analysts). The&#13;
analysis shows that Afghanistan i s a "high risk" country from a public procurement point o f view. The&#13;
procurement procedures and procurement plan for the project are developed keeping in view the public&#13;
procurement environment in the country. Inorder to minimize risk and develop procurement capacity&#13;
within the PCU, an international consultant (a Procurement Specialist) would assist and mentor the PCU's&#13;
procurement staff through effective knowledge transfer and ensure compliance o f the Project procurement&#13;
activities with the Project's legal agreement. Therefore, to minimize risks, the Food and Agriculture&#13;
Organization o f the United Nations (FAO) has been selected, on sole source basis, to provide support to&#13;
MIWRE in project management, scheme preparation,            procurement and financial management, and&#13;
institutional development within MIWRE. FA0 would serve as the "Engineering Design, Construction&#13;
Supervision and Project Management Consultants" to assist MIWREto implement the project.&#13;
&#13;
ProcurementMethodsand Prior Review:Procurement methods are summarized inTable A and details&#13;
for selection o f consultants are summarized inTable AI. The threshold levels for prior review have been&#13;
adopted keeping in view the procurement capacity and emergency nature o f the project. Prior review&#13;
thresholds are summarized in Table B. The Procurement Plan i s given in Table C. All contracts, which&#13;
are not subject to prior review, would be subject to Bank's ex-post review.&#13;
&#13;
CivilWorks:&#13;
&#13;
SmallIrrigationSchemes: Itis estimatedthat about 1000small schemes would be implementedall over&#13;
the country under the project, approximately 200 schemes in each o f the five river basins to be covered&#13;
under the project. These schemes would be surveyed, designed and implemented by MIWRE staff, with&#13;
the full and active assistance o f FAO. The rehabilitation o f small irrigation schemes costing not more&#13;
than US$lOO,OOO (and, on average, about US$lO,OOO with an aggregate amount o f US$10 million) would&#13;
be implementedusingthe following procedures: (i)     Direct Contracting (DC) to community organizations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     26&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
or NGOs; or (ii) the works to qualified domestic contractors after inviting price quotations from at&#13;
                  award&#13;
least three qualified domestic contractors.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, rehabilitation work for office buildings costing not more than US$lOO,OOO each, up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$ 1.0 million, would be implemented by following procedures (i) above.    or (ii)&#13;
The labor management guidelines, approved by IDA, shall be followed inthe implementationof the sub-&#13;
projects. In case of emergencies or to complete any unfinished works without disrupting other ongoing&#13;
operations, the Force Account method may be applied, up to an aggregate o f US$500,000.&#13;
&#13;
Medium Irrigation Schemes:             The works for the medium irrigation schemes costing less than&#13;
US$500,000 each contract would be procured through the National Competitive Bidding (NCB).&#13;
Average cost o f the medium irrigation scheme would be about US$l50,000 and it i s expected that about&#13;
160 medium irrigation schemes ( about 30 in each o f the five water basins) would be undertaken under&#13;
the project. These schemes would be designed and implemented by MIWRE,with assistance from FAO.&#13;
&#13;
Large Irrigation Schemes: The works for large irrigation schemes costing US$500,000 or more would&#13;
be procuredthrough (ICB) procedures. It is expected that average cost o f such schemes would be about&#13;
US$500,000 and about 20 schemes (about four in each o f five water basins) will be implementedunder&#13;
the project. These schemes would also be implemented by MIWRE,with assistance fiom FAO.&#13;
&#13;
Goods:&#13;
&#13;
Goods estimated to cost less than US$200,000 or equivalent per contract may be procured through&#13;
Internationalmational shopping      (Isms). Goods    estimated to cost less than US$ 10,000 or equivalent per&#13;
contract shall be procured through Direct Contracting (DC).           Other than the above, goods shall be&#13;
procuredthrough International Competitive Bidding(ICB).&#13;
&#13;
Consulting Services:&#13;
&#13;
Consultants selection arrangements are shown in Table Al. A contract would be awarded to FAO, on&#13;
sole source basis (already approved by the Bank), for: (a) implementation o f small, medium and large&#13;
schemes.     This would include, identification       of schemes, screening, scheme preparation, surveys,&#13;
feasibility, detailed designs, procurement management, construction supervision, quality control and&#13;
contract management, including certification o f payments to the contractors; (b) preparation, design,&#13;
procurement, management and installation of the hydro-meteorological network, including technical&#13;
assistance and training in its operation, data management, and use; (c) support to MIWRE in project&#13;
management,      including     technical   services,   procurement,   financial   management,    institutional&#13;
strengthening o f the central and regional design and construction offices, rehabilitation o f the office&#13;
buildings, procurement of equipment and vehicles, technical assistance and training. FA0 would use&#13;
MIWREstaff, and international andnationalconsultantsincarrying out these responsibilities andprovide&#13;
institutional strengthening and on- the-job training.&#13;
&#13;
The consulting services for monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) and preparation o f strategic studies and&#13;
feasibility or pre-feasibility studies of projects for future investments would be recruited usingthe Quality&#13;
Based Selection procedure (QBS).        The consultants for Auditing services would be recruited under the&#13;
QCBS procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        27&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Assessment of the ImplementingAgency's Readiness:&#13;
&#13;
The Ministry o f Irrigation, Water Resources and Environment (MIWRE) would be the Borrower's&#13;
implementing agency for the project. The Project Procurement Plan has been prepared. FA0 has already&#13;
set up an office inthe Ministry. The Project CoordinationUnit (PCU) i s also being set up. All irrigation&#13;
schemes would be implemented by the MIWRE, with the full and active assistance o f the FAO. All&#13;
procurement o f goods would be carried out by the MIWRE, with the assistance from FA0 and&#13;
Government's central procurement consultant, i.e. the Crown Agents at present. This would provide&#13;
opportunities to all procurement staff to get on-the-job training and exposure to internationalprocurement&#13;
procedures, under supervision o f the international procurement expert. The contract with the Crown&#13;
Agents would expire on August 2004. The Borrower has already initiated steps for selection o f a new&#13;
Central Procurement Consultant.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Planning:&#13;
&#13;
A detailed procurement plan for the Project has been prepared and attached as Table C. Procurement o f&#13;
goods, works and services shall be undertaken in accordance with the Plan. Incase o f any modification,&#13;
the plan shouldbe forwarded to IDA for its prior approval.&#13;
&#13;
Prior and Post Review:&#13;
&#13;
Prior review requirements of contracts under the Project is provided inTable B. Except for those inTable&#13;
B, all other contracts would be subject to post-reviewbyIDA.&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring and Reporting:&#13;
&#13;
MIWREwill submit quarterly Procurement Status Reports to the Bank within two weeks o f the start o f&#13;
the next quarter in the format attached below as Table D. The Procurement Status Reports will indicate:&#13;
(i)number ofcontracts signed so far, contract amounts, contractor's/supplier's/ consultant's names,&#13;
delivery/contract completion dates; (ii)  revised cost estimates for contracts yet to be processed; and (iii)&#13;
revisedtimings o f procurement actions including advertising, bidding,contract award, and completion.&#13;
&#13;
Justification for Sole Source of F A 0&#13;
&#13;
The Government requested the Bank for clearance to hire, on sole source basis, the FA0 as the main&#13;
"Design Engineer, Construction Supervision and Project Management" consultants to help MIWRE&#13;
implement the project. This was justified on the following grounds:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         (1)     QualiJication and its unique position: FA0 i s the most knowledgeable international&#13;
                 agency about the irrigation sector in Afghanistan, and over the last three decades it has&#13;
                 gained extensive and unique experience in implementing irrigation rehabilitation projects&#13;
                 inthe country.&#13;
&#13;
         (ii) Speed:       The proposed Emergency Imgation Rehabilitation Project needs to be&#13;
                 implemented on the fast track basis to generate visible results on the ground as soon as&#13;
                 possible. This i s in response to Government's wish to deliver results in the agricultural&#13;
                 sector. Given FAO's presence in the country, particularly in the irrigation sector, they&#13;
                 willbe able to mobilize a team very quickly to start project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
         (iii) Confidence:      MIWRE has worked with FA0 in the past, has confidence in the&#13;
                 organization and has good working relations with the staff.&#13;
                                                     28&#13;

The Bank concurred with the Government's view and providedclearance to Govemment's request.&#13;
&#13;
OverallProcurementRiskAssessment:&#13;
&#13;
The procurement riskhas been appraised as high due to the post-conflict environment, the geographically&#13;
remote and dispersednature o f the works. Therefore, frequent procurement review missions are proposed&#13;
(at least once every four months) duringthe project implementation.&#13;

Country Issues&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank has gained substantial experience and understanding o f the financial management issues&#13;
inAfghanistan from implementingseveral projects over the past one year. The overall assessment is that&#13;
though the country's financial management system i s not fully functional, appropriate mitigation&#13;
measures, general and project specific, are being taken for this project in order to ensure fiduciary&#13;
financial  accountability for project funds. Inan effort to strengthen key institutions, the World Bank i s&#13;
financing a Financial Management Agent to assist the Ministry o f Finance and an Audit Agent to assist&#13;
the Control and Audit Office, and the USAID i s financing a team o f consultants to assist the Da&#13;
Afghanistan Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Strengths&#13;
&#13;
The availability o f the Financial Management Agent; the government's commitment to transparent and&#13;
accountable financial management; appointment o f a Financial Management Specialist to MIWRE; and&#13;
the use o f Food and Agriculture Organization o f the United Nations (FAO) for assisting MIWRE with&#13;
project implementation and supervision, are the primary strengths o f the project's financial management&#13;
system.&#13;
&#13;
Weaknesses&#13;
&#13;
As is typical for all projects in Afghanistan, this project too is affected by weaknesses in the Afghan&#13;
institutions and systems for financial management, reporting, auditing, and banlung; and severe shortage&#13;
o f experienced and trained in-country finance professionals in central agencies, such as MOF, as well as&#13;
inthe MIWRE.&#13;

D a Afghanistan Bank (DAB). The amount o f deposit will be US$2.5 million representing an average of&#13;
expenditure for three months.      The SDA, in keeping with current practices for other projects in&#13;
Afghanistan, will be operated by the Grants Management Unit (GMU) in the Ministry o f Finance.&#13;
Requests for payments out of SDA funds will be made to the GMU by the MIWRE, according to&#13;
procedures specified in the `Documentation Guidelines' dated June 1, 2003. Inaddition to payments out&#13;
o f SDA funds, MIWRE could also request the GMU to request IDA to make direct payments to&#13;
contractors, consultants, and UN Agencies, and to issue special commitments for contracts covered by&#13;
letters o f credit. Such requests too should follow the procedures specified in the `Documentation&#13;
Guidelines' (see Attachment 1). Where project payments are for local contractors based outside Kabul,&#13;
these activities will be covered under the UN Agencies' contract, whereby, responsibility for funds&#13;
transfer will be withthe concerned UNAgency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                   35&#13;

RetroactiveFinancing&#13;
&#13;
MWRE has already applied and secured budget allocation for carrying out preparatory work for the&#13;
project. These funds are expected to be used for establishing the PCU and for carrying out activities&#13;
identifiedunder the project.&#13;
&#13;
Inaccessing these funds, the MIWREwillbe expected to follow the normal governmentprocedure. i.e.&#13;
all requests for payments to contractors and consultants, will need to be approved by the Deputy Minister&#13;
or the Minister o f MIWRE, and forwardedto the Treasury Department inthe Ministryo f Finance (MOF).&#13;
The pay groups inthe MOF-Treasury Department will process the payment and generate the check to be&#13;
encashed at the DAB. MIWRE will make such payment requests according to current govemment&#13;
procedures, as advised by the Financial Management Agent in the MOF, i.e. requirements for supporting&#13;
documents and expenditure classification method.&#13;
&#13;
As per the Bank's guidelines on emergency operations, project expenditure paid duringthefour months&#13;
prior to the credit signing date, and subject to 20% of the credit amount, can be claimed as retroactive&#13;
finance, once the credit becomes effective. In order to ensure that expenses paid by MIWRE during the&#13;
aforementioned four-month period are eligible for retroactive financing, MnnirREwill need to follow the&#13;
Bank's procurement procedures and have the expenses recorded inthe MOF's accounting system.&#13;
&#13;
MIWREis also expected to maintain, on a simple spreadsheet/database application, complete details of&#13;
all such financial transactions, and periodically (at least monthly) verify and reconcile this information&#13;
with that inthe MOF's system. Inaddition, MWREshould maintaincomplete supporting documents for&#13;
all such project expenditure. This will enable the IDA to verify these expenses, prior to reimbursing them&#13;
to the Government of Afghanistanunder the retroactive financing provision o f the Credit.&#13;
&#13;
Staffing&#13;
&#13;
As the MIWREdoes not have adequate capacity for financial management, it has been agreed that a full-&#13;
time Financial Management Specialist will be hired to oversee financial management aspects o f the&#13;
project. The proposed Terms o f Reference for the Financial Management Specialist is included in&#13;
Appendix 11. Financial Management Specialist, to be appointed in the Program Coordination Unit&#13;
(PCU) o f the MIWRE,will work closely with the procurement staff inthe PCU, the PCUsinthe regional&#13;
MWREoffices, the GMUinMOF, andthe WorldBank.&#13;
&#13;
AccountingPolicies and Procedures&#13;
&#13;
The Project will follow standard government financial management policies andprocedures, including the&#13;
Chart o f Accounts developed by the Financial Management Agent to record Project expenditures. In&#13;
addition, the Financial Management Specialist will assist the MIWRE to record financial transactions&#13;
o f the project in an electronic format, using simple spread sheet and/or database applications. Such&#13;
recording o f data should enable the MIWREto retrieve financial information for producing the Financial&#13;
Monitoring Reports (FMR) as specified below. FA0 will also be required to report to IDA and MWRE&#13;
on a quarterly basis according to formats to be incorporated in their contract agreements with the&#13;
MIWRE.This informationwill be consolidated inthe FMR. The use o fthese procedures will allow for&#13;
adequate recordingand reportingo f Project expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
ReportingandMonitoring&#13;
&#13;
Quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports will be produced showing: (i)sources and uses o f funds by&#13;
disbursement category and project component; (ii)      physical progress; and (iii)status o f procurement&#13;
                                                    36&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
activities. These will be submittedto the IDA within 45 days o f the end o f the quarter (see Attachment 2&#13;
for a sample format for the financial reports).&#13;
&#13;
Project accounts will be consolidated centrally in the Ministry of Finance, in particular the GMU,&#13;
supported by the Financial Management Agent, and consolidated Project financial statements will be&#13;
prepared for all sources and uses o f Project funds. In addition, the MIWRE, assisted by the Financial&#13;
Management Specialist, will provide the necessary information for producing the FMRs, and also review&#13;
the reports prepared by the GMU, prior to their submission to the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Audit Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
The accounts o f the Project will be audited by the Auditor General, with the support o f the Audit Agent,&#13;
with terms o f reference satisfactory to the Association. The annual Project financial statement to the&#13;
Association would include a summary o f funds received (showing funds received from all sources), and a&#13;
summary o f expenditures shown under the main Project components/ activities and by main categories o f&#13;
expenditures. The audit o f the Project accounts would also include an assessment of: (a) the adequacy o f&#13;
the accounting and intemal control systems; (b) the ability to maintain adequate documentation for&#13;
transactions; and (c) the eligibility o f incurred expenditures for Association financing. The annual Project&#13;
financial statements audited by the Auditor General, supported by the Audit Agent, should be submitted&#13;
within 6 months o f the close o f Afghan fiscal year, i.e. by September 22 o f each year. The following&#13;

                                  Rehabilitation of Irrigation Schemes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Introduction&#13;
The years o f conflict, lack o f any meaningful maintenance and war damage have contributed to the&#13;
deterioration o f irrigation infrastructure. As a result, the present irrigation systems are working at only&#13;
about 25% overall efficiency, the potential being about 40%         - 60%.  About 10% o f the total irrigation&#13;
infrastructure are formal and 90% are traditional systems that were always maintainedeither by individual&#13;
farmers or by the farming communities. Strengthening o f the existing community water management&#13;
organizations i s essential for the sustainability o f irrigation systems. The formal irrigation systems were&#13;
maintained by the Government since the farmers did not have the means to maintain such relatively&#13;
sophisticated irrigation infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
As sufficient evidence is available to affirm globally rising mean annual temperatures (only the&#13;
magnitude o f the rise i s disputed), the continuing decrease o f snow cover, particularly below 2,000 m&#13;
altitude, will certainly lead in the near future to a further reduction in irrigation water availability during&#13;
summer. The base flow o f rivers and streams as well as springdischarge after the winter season depends&#13;
primarily on the existence o f a consolidated snow cover o f high density in low-lying mountainous areas&#13;
(1,500 m - 2,500 m altitude) as early as Novembermecember, and only to a very limited degree on the&#13;
amount o f rainfall. Iftemperatures continued to rise, a greater part o f precipitation will fall as rain and a&#13;
lesser part as snow. This in tum will lead to higher runoff rates in winter and - due to the decreased&#13;
volume o f water from snow melt - to lower stream flow rates in summer, and subsequently to a decrease&#13;
inpotentially irrigable area. The significantreductionof stream andriver flow during 1999to 2002, and&#13;
particularly o fbase flows duringsummer and autumnhave already ledto one o f the lowest water levels o f&#13;
Afghans rivers inhistory.&#13;
&#13;
Superimposed on this negative trend o f snow melt due to globally rising temperatures as a result o f the&#13;
well-known "greenhouse effect", it has been ascertained recently with a high degree o f probability, that&#13;
the increase o f sun activity (protuberances) observed during the last 17 years i s further increasing mean&#13;
annual temperatures. Based on the European experience of snow reduction (since 1865, the volume o f&#13;
glaciers has reduced by more than 50%), accelerated significantly during the last 10 years. It i s safe to&#13;
assume that water availability for irrigation purposes in Afghanistan will be never the same in the future&#13;
as it has been inthe past between the fifties and eighties.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Irrigation inAfghanistan&#13;
2.1 Type of Irrigation Systems&#13;
Irrigation systems in Afghanistan can be divided into 2 main categories: traditional (or non-formal) and&#13;
modem (or formal) systems.&#13;
&#13;
Traditional Irrigation Systems&#13;
            Arhad system. Groundwater i s lifted from shallow wells with the help o f a Persian wheel&#13;
             (arhad) supplying irrigation water to the fields o f an individual farmer. The size o f the&#13;
            irrigated land per well usually does not exceed 3 ha.&#13;
&#13;
                                                         47&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      0   Karez (qanat) systems. Water is brought by free flow via underground tunnels from alluvial&#13;
           aquifers for surface irrigation. Dug by local craftsmen from shafts at close intervals, karezes&#13;
           are usually small in dimensions but may be many lulometers in length. On average, their&#13;
           discharge varies between 10 11s to 200 11s but can, in some cases, reach up to 500 l/s. Karez&#13;
           water is used for irrigationpurposes (irrigated area is 10 ha to 200 ha per karez) as well as for&#13;
           drinkingwater supply.&#13;
&#13;
      0    Small-scale traditional (informal) surface water systems being supplied by stream flow&#13;
           diverted with the help o f temporary brush weirs. Often situated in remote valleys along a&#13;
           stream or river, they vary in size (up to 100 ha) and can be characterizedby the fact that only&#13;
           one village community i s responsible for the operation and maintenance o f the irrigation&#13;
           scheme.&#13;
&#13;
      0    Medium-scale traditional (informal) surface water systems being supplied by river flow&#13;
           diverted with the help o f temporary brush weirs. Defined as a separate category, these&#13;
           systems are characterized by size (100 ha to 2,000 ha) and by the fact that several village&#13;
           communities share one and the same water source (river) through several temporary intakes.&#13;
           Otherwise, the schemes are operated and maintained in a similar way as small-scale and&#13;
           large-scale irrigation systems.&#13;
&#13;
      0    Large-scale traditional (informal) surfacewater systemsbeing also supplied by river flow&#13;
           diverted with the help o f temporary brushweirs. Extending over an area o f up to 200,000 ha&#13;
           (for example, hish-dah-e nahr scheme at Balkh), they are mainly located in flat plains and&#13;
           along the main river valleys.      Although they are called informal, their operations and&#13;
           maintenance i s highlystructured involvingseveral communities o f sometimes different ethnic&#13;
           origin. Using the same source o f water through many individual intakes along a river, even&#13;
           the secondary canals sub-dividing the irrigation water from the primary (conveyance) canal&#13;
           supplied water to the field o f different village communities. Each village has at least one&#13;
           water master (mirab), who delegates his authority to sub water masters responsible for the&#13;
           allocation o f water to different plots o f the scheme. Lawyers (vakil) support the mirab to&#13;
          resolve any disputes over water rights and provide the linkage to government authorities for&#13;
           the registration o f land and water rights. Repair and maintenance works are executed by&#13;
          mobilizing large batches o f labor for a long period, and farmers inthe command area have to&#13;
           contribute in the form o f labor, cash or in-kmd. Historically, large parts o f these schemes&#13;
           have been abandoned because o f the impact o f wars, water logging and salinization,&#13;
          particularly inthe Harirud, FarahRud, Balkhab, Murghab and Helmand valleys.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B. Modern Irrigation Systems&#13;
      0    Modern (formal) surface water systems without storage have a permanent intake structure&#13;
          which in the past was operated and maintainedby the Irrigation Department o f the Ministry&#13;
           o f Water and Power. The management o f the irrigation scheme itself follows the rules o f the&#13;
           large-scale traditional surface water schemes described above.        However, the significant&#13;
           difference i s that the regulation o f water flow to the system depends on a functioning&#13;
          interactionbetween government authorities and the village communities.&#13;
&#13;
      0   Modern (formal) surface water systems with storage. Large-scale irrigation system deve-&#13;
          lopment i s a relatively recent innovation (1960-1978), the most important systems being the&#13;
          Helmand (Kajakai dam) and Arghandab (Arghandab dam) irrigation schemes. Land tenure&#13;
          was different from traditional systems in that some parts o f the schemes were operated under&#13;
          private land ownership agreements, while others were operated as State farms owned and&#13;
          operated by the government.        The management o f these schemes was under complete&#13;
          government control and heavily subsidized.&#13;
&#13;
                                                    48&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         0   Modern (formal) groundwater systems. Little i s known about the irrigation schemes&#13;
             supplied by groundwater from deep or shallow wells. In KhostPaktia province, surface&#13;
             water irrigation schemes were supplied by some 100 deep wells until the late 1980s. Inthe&#13;
             1970s, about 100,000 ha are said to have been under sprinkler irrigation (private and&#13;
             government owned) and plans existed to introduce drip irrigation. Ina few cases, particularly&#13;
             inthe lower reaches o f large traditional schemes, where water shortage is common, surface&#13;
             water irrigation fi-om shallow wells was undertakenby individual farmers.&#13;
&#13;
2.2 IrrigationMethodsand Practices&#13;
Irrigation methods. In traditional as well as in modem irrigation schemes, the dominant irrigation&#13;
method i s basidborder irrigation for cereals and furrow irrigation for vegetables and grapes. Main&#13;
constraints are (i)  shortage o f water after the peak (May/June/July) o f snow melt, and (ii)    shortage o f&#13;
labor for canal cleaning. In areas experiencing high groundwater tables, salinization o f soils i s common&#13;
due to over-irrigation and subsequent water logging. Temporary salinization o f soils o f fields left fallow&#13;
for one or two years does not mean that these fields require drainage. Within the confinement of alluvial&#13;
deposits o f a valley commonly used for irrigation, soil texture i s usually fine to medium in the upper&#13;
layers and often course in the lower layers. Once thoroughly leached before the growing season, the&#13;
temporary salt accumulation i s washed out. However, a drainage system i s indispensable inall those cases&#13;
where irrigated fields are situated on older terraces "outside" the geo-morphologically defined river valley&#13;
and impervious soil layers or conglomerates obstruct deep percolation, as it i s the case in the Helmand&#13;
irrigation system.&#13;
&#13;
Overall irrigation efficiency is only about 20 to 25 percent for both modem and traditional irrigation&#13;
schemes due to the following reasons: (i)    highconveyance losses intraditional schemes with earth canals;&#13;
(ii) operational lossesinmodernschemeswithlinedconveyancecanals; and(iii) on-farm&#13;
     high                                                                                       high&#13;
distribution losses (over-irrigation, poorly levelled land) in both traditional and modem schemes.&#13;
Additionally, there i s usually a waste o f irrigation water intraditional schemes during the first half o f the&#13;
growing season due to unregulated flood water entering the conveyance canal, and a shortage o f water&#13;
during the second half when river flow decreases to its annual minimum. Although the traditional&#13;
irrigation method does not allow the most efficient use o f the available water resources, it should be&#13;
understood that a properly maintained traditional irrigation scheme can attain an overall irrigation&#13;
efficiency o f 40 percent.&#13;
&#13;
Irrigation practices today are characterized by the necessity to irrigate "by all means", leaving little&#13;
room for proper irrigation system management.           Where village communities were able to organize&#13;
themselves in a peaceful manner and received assistance in the rehabilitation o f destroyed (intakes) or&#13;
obsolete (conveyance canals) irrigation structures, irrigation i s mostly practiced in the traditional way:&#13;
operation and maintenance o f the schemes as well as water distribution are managed on a communal basis&#13;
under the supervision o f mirubs, and disputes over water rights are resolved by vakils. In many other&#13;
cases, where communities share the same water resource for the irrigation o f their individual fields but are&#13;
ruled by different ''authorities", farmers are less fortunate and struggle to make their irrigation scheme&#13;
some how operational. This involuntary attitude resulting in makeshift "structures" usually destroyed by&#13;
the next flood, has serious repercussions for the overall functioning o f the irrigation systems:&#13;
accumulation o f sediments at intakes and conveyance canals force the farmers to abandon former existing&#13;
intakes (e.g. in Lashkar Gah), "by-pass" intake canals jeopardize the traditional water distribution rules&#13;
(e.g. in Balkh), uncontrolled floods enter newly constructed intake canals and destroy once fertile&#13;
irrigable land cutting o f f other conveyance canals (e.g. Enjil Canal inHerat), and so on.&#13;
&#13;
Land under irrigation. The potentially (based on existing land and water resources) irrigable area in&#13;
Afghanistan i s supposed to be in the order o f 5.3 million hectares. Table 1 gives an overview o f the&#13;
distribution o f the area irrigated in 1978 (in total about 2.6 million ha), the last year for which reliable&#13;
data are available. The Land Cover Survey from 1992, which defined active and inactive irrigated agricul-&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
ture per province, estimated the actually (based on existing irrigation water distribution infrastructure)&#13;
irrigable area to be some 3.4 million ha. "Inactive irrigated agriculture" does not necessarily mean aban-&#13;
doned irrigated fields requiring rehabilitation. In large irrigation schemes, the irrigable area is usually&#13;
larger than the one actually irrigated, particularly in dry years when irrigation water i s short and does not&#13;
allow the cultivation o f all imgable fields. However, water logging and dilapidated water distribution&#13;
structures are among the reasons for rehabilitation.&#13;

2.3 PresentConditionsof IrrigationSchemes&#13;
Impact of Yearsof Conflict (1979-2001)&#13;
About one-third o f all villages were destroyed during the first 10years o f war (1979-1989). However, the&#13;
negative impact o f war on irrigation infrastructure was due to both destruction and the exodus o f farmers&#13;
leaving behind the schemes without attendance.          Since 1992, many refugees have retumed to their&#13;
villages and tried to use their former schemes again.&#13;
&#13;
Traditional irrigation systems having had a temporary intake were relatively easy to put under operation&#13;
again, the only limitingfactor being the availability o f labor. The larger the scheme, however, the greater&#13;
were the problems encountered: complete sedimentation o f the conveyance canals, division o f the&#13;
command area among different local commanders, and hence the impossibility to install the former&#13;
mirabhakil system again. These circumstances made it difficult to rehabilitate large traditional irrigation&#13;
schemes in spite o f the fact that there are no uncommon technical problems to the farmers. Although it&#13;
could be argued that modern irrigation systems, having a permanent intake structure, would have been&#13;
less prone to destruction than traditional ones, the indirect impact o f war on these modem systems i s&#13;
indeed much more serious: in addition to the problems occurred in traditional schemes, the "inflexible"&#13;
(stationary) intake structures o f modem irrigation schemes are now, in most cases, out o f function not&#13;
only due to the missing mechanical parts, but also due to lack o f unprofessional operation or non-&#13;
operation o f the gates (e.g. flushing gate closed, intake gate open).      In several cases, this led to the&#13;
accumulation o f large quantities o f sediment in front o f the intake causing the river to change its thalweg&#13;
or widen its bed (e.g. Helmand river at Bokhra intake). Once this has happened, the rehabilitation o f the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      50&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
intake can become too costly (major river training works are required), if not impossible (the former&#13;
intake site may not be technically andor economically feasible).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Quantification of Destruction&#13;
&#13;
At present, it is possible only to make purely qualitative assessment o f the irrigated area to be rehabili-&#13;
tated: an estimated 10 per cent o f all irrigation systems were directly affected by war (not taking into&#13;
account the indirect effects o f neglect and abandonment). This corresponds to an irrigated area of at least&#13;
260,000 ha.      Another 40 per cent o f all irrigation systems (particularly large-scale schemes) were&#13;
damaged due to lack o f maintenance, especially due to uncontrolled flow (floods) into the systems and&#13;
siltation o f canals. This corresponds to an irrigated area o f 1.04 million ha.. An estimated 20 per cent o f&#13;
all irrigation systems require improvement o f on-farm water management to avoid under-irrigation (low&#13;
crop yields) or over-irrigation (water logging, salinization). This corresponds to an irrigated area o f&#13;
520,000 ha. Inother words, it i s safe to state that at least one million o f irrigated or irrigable landrequires&#13;
rehabilitation.&#13;
&#13;
3. Rehabilitationof Irrigation Infrastructure&#13;
3.1 Rationalefor Rehabilitation&#13;
Inorder to makebest use of the Country's limited, albeit yet sufficient, water resources and ensure their&#13;
sustainable use for irrigation purposes, water abstraction from rivers, streams, and groundwater aquifers&#13;
has to be done in an efficient, effective and sustainable manner. This was ensured throughout Afghani-&#13;
stan's history: traditional brush weirs for riverhtream diversion and hlometer-long underground canals&#13;
(karez) giving ample evidence of the Afghan farmers' skills and knowledge. Following more than 20&#13;
years o f war and four years o f drought, however, many irrigation schemes, formal and informal, small,&#13;
medium and large, suffer from low water use efficiency, partly because o f physical damage o f irrigation&#13;
infrastructure, and partly because o f inefficient on-farm water management, especially where the&#13;
traditional water distribution systemhas been abandoned.&#13;
&#13;
Except for the "Community-Based Irrigation Infrastructure Rehabilitation Program" implemented by the&#13;
Ministry of Irrigation, Water Resources and Environment (MIWRE), with technical assistance o f FA0&#13;
and funded by the Dutch, German and Italian Government (for a total o fUS$4.2 million), at present there&#13;
is no systematic irrigation infrastructure rehabilitation throughout the country. The main purpose o f the&#13;
ongoing but limited MIWRERAO irrigation rehabilitation program i s to respond to urgent needs o f&#13;
smallholders dependant on irrigated agriculture, and to strengthen the operational capacity o f MrWRE at&#13;
national, regional and local levels.&#13;
&#13;
3.2 Justification for rehabilitation&#13;
The immediate rehabilitation o f irrigation infrastructure i s imperative, not only to increase food security&#13;
but also to enable the transitional government to contribute in an efficient manner to socio-economic&#13;
stability and, subsequently, to peace and security in rural areas.           Therefore, capacity building and&#13;
institutional strengthening must go hand in hand with the rehabilitation o f irrigation schemes, ensuring a&#13;
quick positive impact on the livelihood o f farmers, particularly refugees and internally displaced people&#13;
(IDPs), and setting up an adequate institutional framework for efficient coordination and implementation&#13;
o f irrigationprojects.&#13;
&#13;
Following 23 years o fwar, three major issues hamper future sustainable water use for irrigation purposes,&#13;
namely (i)the lack o f technical and financial means o f smallholders to rehabilitate damaged irrigation&#13;
infrastructure; (ii)the inability o f civil servants to deliver the required services according to their mandate&#13;
to smallholders, who depend on the production o f irrigated cereals and other crops for their livelihood;&#13;
&#13;
                                                         51&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and (iii) lack of a national water resources data collection and analysis system to make sustainable use&#13;
          the&#13;
o f the available water resources. The project addresses all these crucial issues, suggesting for each issue&#13;
the implementation of a tailor-made component to the specific problem prevailing in the water resources&#13;
and irrigation sub-sector inthe country.&#13;
&#13;
The project would provide funds for the rehabilitationo f small, medium and large irrigation schemes, and&#13;
for the preparation o f feasibility studies for large irrigation andor multipurposeprojects. Inthis context,&#13;
the need to ensure proper survey and design o f the irrigation schemes to be rehabilitated has been&#13;
identified to be crucial for achieving the restoration o f irrigated agriculture. Hence, intensive formal and&#13;
informal training for MIWRE staff throughout the country i s required parallel to the implementation o f&#13;
the project. It i s important to note, that all technical assistance provided under the project i s designed to (i)&#13;
to assist MrWRE staff inthe day-to-day work o f implementing irrigation scheme rehabilitation, and (ii)         to&#13;
train MIWRE staff on-the-job in major subjects, including surveying, hydraulics, civil engineering,&#13;
hydrological and soil analysis, and overall irrigation scheme design.&#13;
&#13;
3.3 Strategicconsiderations for rehabilitation&#13;
Scope of rehabilitation and geographicaldistribution. Inspite o f efforts, there remains enormous task&#13;
o f rehabilitating about half (1.3 million hectares) o f Afghanistan's irrigation schemes. This includes&#13;
about one million ha of traditional irrigation schemes supplied by perennial rivers and streams as well as&#13;
about 50,000 ha supplied by springs and karezes, all operated and maintainedby the farmers themselves;&#13;
and about 250,000 ha o f modern irrigation schemes operated and maintained by the Government.&#13;
Rehabilitation comprises all activities which have to be undertaken to safeguard the irrigation scheme&#13;
against floods and to enable the farmers to manage them efficiently and economically.                 Though the&#13;
irrigation potential and return on investment varies throughout the country, equitable distribution o f&#13;
interventions i s very important to reach as many potentialbeneficiaries as possible.&#13;
&#13;
Type of rehabilitationworks. Imgationrehabilitationactivities canbe classified into the following&#13;
categories o frehabilitationworks:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             Verification:          - Problemidentification, survey, (re)design, project formulation.&#13;
&#13;
             Maintenance:           - Cleaning   o f canals and karezes;&#13;
                                    - service  and minor repairs o f flow regulating devices and turnouts; and&#13;
                                    - (Re)establishment    o ftemporary intake structures;&#13;
&#13;
             Construction:          - Permanent    intake structures,&#13;
                                    - Spillway, distribution and drainage system structures;&#13;
                                    - Canal  liningandcanalbank stabilization;&#13;
                                    - River training (flood protection and thalweg rectification); and&#13;
                                    - Flow gauge stations.&#13;
&#13;
             Management:            - (Re)establishment    and improvement o fMiraWYakiZ system;&#13;
                                    - Reservoir   operation and intake regulation;&#13;
                                    - Watershed conservation and groundwater recharge;&#13;
                                    - O&amp;M o fprovincial irrigation departments;&#13;
                                    - O&amp;M o fregional water authorities andbranchoffices; and&#13;
                                    - Monitoringo fNGOsirrigation rehabilitation activities. Training:&#13;
&#13;
             Training               - Engineers, technicians, craftsmen, Mirabs, extension specialists; and&#13;
                                    - Water  user groups (according to their tasks).&#13;
&#13;
                                                          52&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
It is important to agree with the farming community before the implementationof construction works on&#13;
future operation and maintenance rules. As there i s no alternative at present to the traditional mirub/vukiZ&#13;
system, all water users dependent on the same water source must acknowledge the authority o f the mirab&#13;
and, possibly, accept the decisions made by the vakil, incase o f disputes. Irrigation rehabilitation efforts&#13;
to be undertaken immediately will have to focus on types o f works, for example, which (i)           increase&#13;
agricultural output o f the individual farmer; (ii)  prevent irrigation schemes from further destruction by&#13;
floods andor salinization; and (iii)strengthen local capacities in the (re)design, (re)construction,&#13;
operation and management o f irrigation schemes.&#13;
&#13;
Importance of maintenance. Irrigation must be seen as a technology applied to satisfy crop water&#13;
requirements due to lack o f precipitation.          Natural resource use, through the imposition o f a&#13;
technicalhtatic (irrigation) system on a naturavdynamic (river) system, i s not sustainable without properly&#13;
maintaining crucial system components such as intake, water distribution and conveyance structures.&#13;
Lack o f maintenance o f irrigation schemes does not only decrease the overall operational efficiency but&#13;
causes hydrological and geo-morphological changes o f the natural system leading to completely different&#13;
environmental conditions - such as change o f river course, decrease (accumulation) or increase (erosion)&#13;
o f the river's sediment carrying capacity, or salinization o f land - than those under which the irrigation&#13;
scheme were built and managed satisfactorily. This applies to traditional and modem irrigation systems&#13;
alike and has serious implications inthe case o f Afghanistan, where the rural settlement pattern directly&#13;
correlates with the availability and use o f surface and ground water resources.&#13;
&#13;
Importance and limit of community participation. Experiences gained elsewhere and also in&#13;
Afghanistan since 1989 have unambiguously shown that community participation i s the most crucial&#13;
element o f making external assistance sustainable. District Rehabilitation Shuras (DRSs) can facilitate the&#13;
identification and co-ordination o f rehabilitation activities. However, they can not substitute the village&#13;
community (traditional shuru) responsible for the rehabilitation and operation o f an irrigation scheme.&#13;
The project will encourage the involvement o f local communities during rehabilitation as well as&#13;
operations and maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
Changing role of NGOs. With a few exceptions, NGOs have played an important role in assisting&#13;
Afghans to survive the impacts o f war on social life and in the rehabilitation o f Afghanistan's&#13;
infrastructure. It is, however, necessary to recognize that NGOs can neither fully take over the role o f&#13;
social service institutions nor the one o f construction companies. Many hydraulic structures rehabilitated&#13;
or newly constructed during the last years give ample testimony o f lacking professionalism in the&#13;
application o f technical know-how and o f missing logistical competence in the implementation o f&#13;
construction works. Among the several hundred NGOs operating in Afghanistan, only about a dozen&#13;
NGOs might have the potential to develop the necessary capacity in order to design and implement&#13;
hydraulic structures for irrigation purposes.         In the future, these NGOs will have to become&#13;
engineering/constructioncompanies, act as registeredprofessional contractors and eligible for contracting&#13;
bylineMinistries, UNagencies, or the donor community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.4 Irrigation Schemes to beRehabilitated&#13;
&#13;
The project addresses the rehabilitation o f existing irrigation schemes (sub-projects). Depending on their&#13;
size (interms o f area under irrigation), their water conveyance system (one or several canals supplied by&#13;
one water resource), and the estimated rehabilitation cost, the existing irrigation schemes are divided into&#13;
three broad categories. The rehabilitation o f uZZ irrigation schemes require engineering surveys and&#13;
design. However, ingeneral, the complexity o f irrigation scheme rehabilitation increases with the size o f&#13;
the scheme, and hence the need for engineering inputalso increases.&#13;
&#13;
Selection criteria for irrigation schemes to be rehabilitated. The existing irrigation systems in&#13;
Afghanistan consist o f a large number o f small (several thousands), medium (several hundred) and large&#13;
(several dozens) irrigation schemes. These are mainly traditional (or non-formal) irrigation schemes&#13;
&#13;
                                                      53&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(90%), and only a few modern (or formal) large irrigation schemes (10%).                The final selection o f&#13;
irrigation schemes for rehabilitation under the project must meet the selection criteria agreed with the&#13;
Government (see Appendix 5).&#13;
&#13;
Small Irrigation Schemes: Approximately, 1100 small irrigation schemes are expected to be&#13;
rehabilitated under the project. Priority should be given to those provinces, where rehabilitation provides&#13;
the greatest returnto the greatest number o fpeople. According to a recent report on rapid assessment and&#13;
inception for framework o f water resources management, these are for canal and karez rehabilitation in&#13;
the provinces o f Kandahar and Wardak; for canal rehabilitation in the provinces o f Herat, Parwan and&#13;
Badakhshan; and for karez rehabilitation in the provinces o f Ghami and Zabul. Major objective o f any&#13;
project intervention will be the rehabilitation o f crucial hydraulic structures to solve key problems o f&#13;
individual schemes and overcome bottlenecks o f otherwise functioning schemes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MediumIrrigationSchemes: Each o f about 160 medium irrigation schemes, likely to be rehabilitated&#13;
under the project, will be selected by MIWRE for inclusion in the Project by following the scheme&#13;
selection criteria. The rehabilitation package for each irrigation scheme will also include (i)       detailed&#13;
scope o f work; (ii)   detailed survey; (iii)  detailed scheme rehabilitation design work; and (iv) bidding&#13;
documents. The provinces o f Herat, Kandahar, Kunduz, Parwan, Ghami, Baghlan and Helmand have&#13;
been identified to be priority provinces for medium and large irrigation scheme rehabilitation. Major&#13;
objective o f all rehabilitation efforts i s to systematically rehabilitate individual irrigation schemes - at&#13;
watershed level - inorder to maximize water use through an increase o fthe overall system efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
Large Irrigation Schemes: The selection, detailed analysis and documentation for the procurement o f&#13;
about 20 large irrigation schemes, to be included in the project, will be the same as for the medium&#13;
irrigation schemes. However, the rehabilitation o f large irrigation schemes i s more complex and costly.&#13;
Major objective .is to systematically rehabilitate   -at sub-basin level - large irrigation schemes in order to&#13;
optimize the sustainable use o f water resources in priority watersheds as well as to safeguard national&#13;
natural and capital assets.&#13;
&#13;
Scope of rehabilitation under the Project: A total o f 1,280 irrigation schemes covering approximately&#13;
280,000 ha o f irrigated land are proposed for rehabilitation duringthe three year project period, including&#13;
1,100 small-scale irrigation schemes covering 110,000 ha, 160medium-sized irrigation schemes covering&#13;
120,000 ha, and significant parts o f 20 large irrigation schemes covering 50,000 ha (see Table 2). Due to&#13;
the expected increase inwater use efficiency andor water availability, it i s expected that the irrigated area&#13;
after rehabilitationwill be about 25% larger than the irrigated area before rehabilitation, bringingthe total&#13;
irrigated area to benefit from the Project to an estimated 350,000 ha. Each irrigation scheme (sub-project)&#13;
shall be identified, selected, promoted, appraised, approved, carried out and monitored inaccordance with&#13;
procedures and other provisions outlined invarious appendices o f this Technical Annex.&#13;
&#13;
A first assessment of irrigation schemes to be potentially rehabilitated under the project is based on the&#13;
surveys conducted by MIWRE staff, assisted by FAO, since August 2003. Based on the results o f these&#13;
surveys, an indicative list o f 32 eligible medium irrigation schemes (one in each province, see Table 3),&#13;
and another list o f 10 large irrigation schemes (two per region, see Table 4) have been prepared,&#13;
Depending on the availability o f funds, these indicative lists may to be adjusted to the actual situation&#13;
prevailing once the project has started. Concerning the rehabilitation o f small irrigation schemes, the&#13;
MIWREdata base, establishedincollaborationwith FA0 duringthe last 12months, provides thousands&#13;
o f identified canals and karezes, spread all over the country, which require rehabilitation.&#13;

&#13;
Categories of Irrigation Schemes:&#13;
&#13;
         The project deals with the rehabilitationo f existing irrigation schemes (sub-projects). Depending&#13;
on their size (in terms o f area under irrigation), their water conveyance system (one or several canals&#13;
supplied by one water resource) and the estimated rehabilitation cost, the existing irrigation schemes are&#13;
divided into three broad categories, small, mediumand large:&#13;
&#13;
              Scheme Category               Cost o f Rehabilitation    Types o f Irrigation&#13;
                                                                            Schemes&#13;

          source)                                                            Springs&#13;
                                                                             Canals&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         The rehabilitation o f all irrigation schemes require engineering surveys and design. However, in&#13;
general, the complexity o f irrigation schemes increases with the size and hence the need for engineering&#13;
inputalso increases.&#13;
&#13;
Selection Criteria for Irrigation Schemes:&#13;
&#13;
         The existing irrigation system in Afghanistan consists o f a large number o f small, medium and&#13;
large irrigation schemes, both formal (modem) and informal (traditional). The final selection o f irrigation&#13;
schemes for rehabilitation under the project must meet the appropriate selection criteria. As agreed with&#13;
the Government, the following factors are indicative o f their importance and will be used as final scheme&#13;
selection criteria:&#13;
&#13;
1.       Exclusion Criteria:&#13;
&#13;
         (0      Significant land mine risk (not certified by the Mine Action Center for Afghanistan&#13;
                 (MACA) as having low-to-nil risk).&#13;
&#13;
         (ii) Significant social issues, including (a) social safeguard impacts (e.g. needfor land&#13;
                 acquisition); (b) unresolved or potential water rights disputes with other users o f the&#13;
                 water source (e.g. in case o f engineering intake construction); (c) unresolved water&#13;
                 distribution disputes within the system command area (e. g. with tailenders); or (d)&#13;
                 absence of functioning institutionalmaintenance arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
         (iii) Significantenvironmentalsafeguardissues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       63&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         (iv)    Highprobability oftriggeringriparianissues bythe downstream riparian states.&#13;
&#13;
2.       Inclusion Criteria:&#13;
&#13;
         (i)     Large economic impact, as reflected by the low rehabilitation cost, large incremental&#13;
                 benefits and large number o f beneficiaries per ha o f irrigatedland.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         (ii)    Agreement by local communities to contribute towards scheme rehabilitation costs and to&#13;
                 take over the responsibility for post-rehabilitation operations and maintenance (0 &amp; M)&#13;
                 cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         (iii)   Balanced geographical distribution inall the five river basins&#13;
&#13;
Preparationand AppraisalFramework:&#13;
&#13;
         The above selection criteria (both the exclusion-type and the inclusion-type) will be applied to all&#13;
the existing schemes that are proposed for inclusion in the project. In a particular river basin, the&#13;
irrigation schemes with the greatest economic impact will have a priority over others, especially when the&#13;
proposed schemes meet all other selection criteria. The Ministry of Irrigation, Water Resources and&#13;
Environment (MTWRE) must certify in writing that the irrigation schemes proposed for inclusion in the&#13;
project satisfactorily meet all the selection criteria.&#13;
&#13;
         Inadditionto the selectioncriteriaoutlined above, the irrigationschemes proposed for inclusion&#13;
in the project must also undertake detailed analysis (with respect to safeguards assessment, economic&#13;
impact assessment and community water assessment) to justify their inclusion. This will, however, vary&#13;
by the type o firrigation schemes, as follows:&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Sub-project proposals for irrigation schemes will include documentation on (a) whether andhow land&#13;
donations, ifany, have taken place; and (b) whether water rightshave been clarified with down-stream&#13;
users ifintake construction i s part o f scheme rehabilitation. This i s particularly relevant for small&#13;
irrigation schemes. The check list on negative environmental and social impacts will also be part o f sub-&#13;
project proposal.&#13;
&#13;
Appraisal and ApprovalProcess:&#13;
&#13;
         Once the irrigation schemes are selected for rehabilitation under the project, there is a need to&#13;
canyout the following in order to obtain the clearance from the World Bank to initiate actual&#13;
rehabilitation.&#13;
&#13;
1.      Small Irrigation Schemes:           The MTWRE will select each small irrigation scheme for&#13;
rehabilitation under the project using the selection criteria. For each scheme, there i s a need to clarify&#13;
water rightsregardingthe source and command area, make an assessment o f community organizations for&#13;
&#13;
                                                       64&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
water management, develop strategy/action plan to strengthen the community organizations, and sign an&#13;
agreement between the MIWRE and the community for the community to contribute (in the form o f&#13;
labor, material, cash or in-kmd) towards rehabilitation o f irrigation scheme and to take over the&#13;
responsibility for all the regular operations and maintenance, including cost, after the rehabilitation work&#13;
is complete. All the small irrigation schemes, that are expected to be rehabilitated inyear 1 (also for year&#13;
2 and year 3), will be grouped into one list. Before the actual rehabilitation begins, this list must be&#13;
cleared by the World Bank. For each irrigation scheme, there i s also a need to prepare (i)       the scope o f&#13;
work, (ii) rehabilitation design, and (iii) biddingdocuments. The selection of the qualified contractor&#13;
                                           the&#13;
for actual rehabilitation will follow the Bank procurement guidelines. A random sample o f completed&#13;
irrigation schemes are subject to post-reviewby the World Bank during supervision.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Medium Irrigation Schemes: Each o f the medium irrigation scheme will be selected by MIWRE&#13;
for inclusion in the project by following the scheme selection criteria. Each o f the selected scheme will&#13;
then be subject to detailed additional analysis with respect to (i)environmental and social assessment; (ii)&#13;
economic impact assessment; (iii)assessment o f community water organizations, and (iv) beneficiary&#13;
commitment to contribute towards scheme            rehabilitation costs. There will also be an agreement&#13;
(between MIWRE and the community) with an obligation for the local community to contribute (in the&#13;
form o f labor, material, cash or in-kind)towards rehabilitation o f irrigation scheme and to take over all&#13;
the regular operations and maintenance activities, including cost, after the rehabilitation i s complete. The&#13;
rehabilitation package for each irrigation scheme will also include (i)detailed survey; (ii)          detailed&#13;
rehabilitation design work; (iii)   detailed scope o f work; and (iv) bidding documents.           A qualified&#13;
contractor will be selected following the World Bank's procurement guidelines. A random sample o f&#13;
completed schemes will be subject to post-review by the World Bank duringo f supervision.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Large Irrigation Schemes: The selection, detailed analysis and documentation for procurement&#13;
for large irrigation schemes will be the same as for the medium irrigation schemes. However, since the&#13;
rehabilitationof large irrigation schemes i s more complex and costly, the procurement rules may be&#13;
slightly different. Furthermore, all the large irrigation schemes will be subject to prior-review bythe&#13;
World Bank. Inother words, rehabilitation can begin only after the Bank gives a clearance.&#13;

Non-formalwater managementsystems&#13;
&#13;
Of the total irrigated area o f around 3.3 million hectares, only 10%consist o f formal systems constructed&#13;
and managed by the state. The remaining 90% consist o f `traditional' or non-formal irrigation systems&#13;
managed by (and usually also constructed by) communities. Of these, more than 80% are canal irrigation&#13;
systems with intakes from rivers and streams, about 5% are fed by springs, and 5% are fedby karezes.&#13;
&#13;
Traditional canal-based schemes are widely distributed in every province inthe country and range in size&#13;
from a few hectares in highmountain valleys to extensive networks on the northem plains. Some water&#13;
sources such as large canals provide water to several villages, while at the same time, many villages have&#13;
several water sources&#13;
&#13;
Operations and maintenance o f traditional and many modern systems are carried out by the local water&#13;
users (landowners and tenants), typically headed by a mirab or `water master'. The mirab's job i s to&#13;
control water distribution, perform minor maintenance, and call people together to handle major&#13;
maintenance or repairs through voluntary work (ashar).            The mirab also attempts to adjudicate&#13;
differences over water use between different water users along the length o f the canal. Maintenance and&#13;
repairs includes desilting canals and repairing and extending stone and brushintake structures inthe river.&#13;
The mirab i s selected from within the local farming community, though he is not necessarily a farmer.&#13;
This form of collaborationthrough what is equivalent to non-formal water users associations and the role&#13;
of the mirabs are ancient local institutions commonly found all across Afghanistan. On larger systems,&#13;
the mirab will have one or more assistant mirabs, called chak bashis (inthe North) who undertake more&#13;
o f the manual and physical tasks o f operations and maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Community participationinirrigationscheme rehabilitation&#13;
&#13;
For rehabilitation o f small and medium schemes, the project will rely on the involvement o f the existing&#13;
institutional fi-amework o f non-formal water user associations and mirabs for the planning and&#13;
implementation o f irrigation schemes rehabilitation, as well as for the subsequent operations and&#13;
maintenance o f the schemes. The rehabilitation (and where feasible, improvement) o f irrigation schemes&#13;
will be demand driven and require the commitment by the beneficiaries to make a small contribution&#13;
towards the capital costs o f the rehabilitation and be responsible for the subsequent operations and&#13;
maintenance, including the costs. The process for involvement o fbeneficiaries will be as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       (i)   Information dissemination to potential beneficiary communities on the project, and the&#13;
            requirement for capital cost contribution and responsibility for operations and maintenance.&#13;
             Based on data at MIWRE and FA0 the on existing irrigation schemes in need o f&#13;
            rehabilitation, potential beneficiary communities (e.g. within a district or watershed) will be&#13;
             invited to submit applications for participation inthe project by a certain date.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      66&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  (ii)   Applications from potential beneficiary communities (Attachment 1) will be in a standard&#13;
          format with basic information on:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          (a)    the irrigation system (type o f source, prior and present command area, number o f&#13;
                 landowners, number o f cultivators, types o f rehabilitation and improvements&#13;
                 proposed);&#13;
         (b)     existing maintenance arrangements (is there a mirab in the community responsible for&#13;
                 maintenance and water distribution, the date and number of people that participatedin&#13;
                 the last ashar work to maintain or repair the system);&#13;
         (c)     willingness to contribute towards capital costs (cash, labor, materials); and&#13;
         (d)     willingness to undertake and cover the costs o f operations and maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
  (iii)ReviewofapplicationsbyMIWREonthebasisoftheexclusionandinclusioncriteriadefined&#13;
       inAppendix 5 to determine whether the scheme can be included, and its priority inrelation to&#13;
       other eligible schemes.&#13;
&#13;
  (iv) For schemes that meet the selection criteria, MIWRE will undertake field verification o f the&#13;
      information inthe application from the potential beneficiary community, as well as verification&#13;
       o f its commitment regardingcontribution towards capital costs and O&amp;M.&#13;
&#13;
   (v) Preliminaryjoint MIWRElcommunityassessment o fthe rehabilitationneeds o f the system with&#13;
       participation o f mirab and farmer representatives (can be simultaneous with the MrWRE field&#13;
       verification).    If engineered intake structures are considered as part of the rehabilitation,&#13;
       agreements should be obtained by the community with downstream users o f the water for&#13;
       irrigation. If the community does not have a mirab, agreement should be reached with the&#13;
      beneficiary farmers on a process to establish a water user association.&#13;
&#13;
  (vi) Detailed design and costing o f scheme rehabilitation (including agreed improvements) by&#13;
       MIWRE.&#13;
&#13;
 (vii) Endorsement bythe beneficiarycommunity o fproposedrehabilitationplan and costs (including&#13;
       community cost contribution) at community meeting.&#13;
&#13;

      labor from the beneficiary community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(x)   Inspection o f completed rehabilitation works by beneficiary farmers and handover to these o f&#13;
       operations and maintenance responsibility through a Maintenance Memorandum o f&#13;
                                                  6 /&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
           Understanding (Attachment 3) between MrWRE and the beneficiary community, which&#13;
           describes O&amp;M arrangements (maintenance plan and cost recovery).&#13;
&#13;
Community cost contribution&#13;
&#13;
A condition for participation in the project is that the farmers benefiting from the rehabilitation o f an&#13;
irrigation scheme commit to contribute at least 10% o f the capital costs for system rehabilitation (and&#13;
improvements, if any).&#13;
&#13;
The primary rationale for this requirement is, that it constitutes the most direct and effective means to&#13;
verify whether a non-formal water-user association exists, and to test its functioning through the&#13;
mobilization o f farmers for voluntary work or other forms o f contributions related to the rehabilitation o f&#13;
their irrigation scheme. In case a non-formal water-user association does not exist, the requirement o f a&#13;
capital cost contribution will be a key element in the formation and strengthening o f an institutional&#13;
framework that can be in place when the rehabilitation work i s completed and the users have to take&#13;
responsibility for O&amp;M.&#13;
&#13;
The forms, amount, and timetable o f this contribution will be agreed in the Rehabilitation MOU. The&#13;
community capital cost contribution can be in the form o f cash (not likely inpractice), labor, or transport&#13;
of materials (sand and gravel). If materials such as sand and gravel are available within the area over&#13;
which the community holds rights to land, they will be assigned a value to be counted against the&#13;
community capital cost contribution.&#13;
&#13;
Depending on the volume o f unshlled work required for the scheme rehabilitation, the community&#13;
contribution can either consist o f (i)all unskilled labor (if the labor requirement i s limited), (ii)   all&#13;
unshlled labor for specific tasks (e.g. scheme improvements), or (iii)       all unshlled labor from the&#13;
community paid at a lower rate than the existing daily wage rate. The value o f the labor contribution can&#13;
either be counted as a direct contribution on the capital costs o f scheme rehabilitation, or be made&#13;
available to the water user association as a maintenance fund at the hand-over o f the rehabilitated system.&#13;
If communitycontributionconsistsoflabor(eitherunpaidorpaidatalowerrate),itmustbeensured&#13;
   the&#13;
that all farm households benefiting from the irrigation system rehabilitation are participating. Since a&#13;
daily wage rate set lower than the existing level i s likely to attract only or primarily laborers from the&#13;
poorer farming or landless households, the more affluent households, which do not contribute labor,&#13;
would have to make a contribution inanother form (e.g. cash, food for the laborers, or providing transport&#13;
of materials, ifthey own tractors).&#13;
&#13;
Strengtheningof non-formalwater usersassociations&#13;
&#13;
A non-formal water user association will comprise all the farmers (landowners and tenants) receiving&#13;
water for irrigation under the command area o f a particular schemes selected for rehabilitation. The&#13;
farmers would be required to nominate a group o f representatives (minimum three, including the mirab&#13;
and farmers at the tail-end o f the system) to interact with MTWRE. The nomination o frepresentatives can&#13;
take place either through a meeting o f all the farmers, or, where elected NSP Community Development&#13;
Councils have been established, though consultation with this forum. The strengthening o f a non-formal&#13;
water user association can take place through two types o f activities:&#13;

                           Environment and Social Safeguards Framework&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
Afghanistan i s a rugged, land-locked, mountainous country (more than 50% o f its area o f nearly 65&#13;
million ha i s 2000m above mean sea level) with conditions difficult for agriculture even in best of times&#13;
due to the continental type o f climate. Yet, agriculture i s a key activity in the country and it accounts for&#13;
over 50% o f country's GDP and employs about 75% o f the population. With an estimated population o f&#13;
around 25 million, Afghanistan i s among the poorest countries in the world. In the last several decades,&#13;
the successive wars have taken their toll. Exposure to harsh weather conditions with little maintenance&#13;
and, sometimes, deliberate destruction have debilitated the irrigation system. The proposed Emergency&#13;
Imgation Rehabilitation Project seeks to rehabilitate the irrigation sector and help revitalize the&#13;
agriculture rural economy o f Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
&#13;
The main objective o f the project i s that farmers in the project area utilize improved, reliable and&#13;
equitable irrigation water deliveries to increase agricultural productivity and farm income, improve food&#13;
security and livelihoods and reduce vulnerability to drought. This objective will be achieved by: (i)&#13;
rehabilitating and improving existing dilapidated irrigation infrastructure; (ii)   restoring and modernizing&#13;
the hydro-meteorological network for better monitoring, planning, sustainable use and management o f&#13;
water resources; and (iii)  developingthe institutional capacity o f public sector water institutions, existing&#13;
community water organizations and farmers for operating and maintaining irrigation system in a&#13;
sustainable manner. This will reduce poverty in the rural areas and accelerate transition to sustainable&#13;
agriculture and dynamic rural economy inAfghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
ProjectDescription&#13;
&#13;
The project focuses on the rehabilitation on existing dilapidated irrigation infrastructure, using a river&#13;
basin management approach. The project has four components: (a) rehabilitation o f formal and informal&#13;
irrigation schemes; (b) rehabilitation o f hydro-meteorological network; (c) preparation o f feasibility&#13;
studies and monitoring; and (d) institutional development. Sub-projects under the project will cover parts&#13;
o f all 5 major river basins inAfghanistan, malung itnational in scope.&#13;
&#13;
Potentialadverseimpactsof rehabilitation&#13;
&#13;
Most adverse impacts o frehabilitationo f irrigation schemes are restricted to the areas close to the existing&#13;
infrastructure. However, there are some off-site impacts such as those due to the borrowing o f earth or&#13;
disposal o f dredged material. Many o f the impacts arise from improper drainage and therefore, the&#13;
importance o f providing and maintaining adequate drainage cannot be overemphasized. Adverse impacts&#13;
of existing irrigation facilities can be mostly traced back to ineffective management and maintenance in&#13;
most cases. With the possible exception o f the loss o f habitat, which may have been created by faulty&#13;
management in the first place, most o f the adverse impacts o f drainage are likely to be alleviated due to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
the project activities and may not require additional measures The potential impacts of the proposed&#13;
activities will encompass the construction and operation phase.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0    Construction Phase: Soil erosion, disposal o f construction spoils, sanitary conditions and health&#13;
         as well as social and cultural conflict risks due to the presence o f migrant construction labor (may&#13;
         not be extensive in light o f the present conditions in Afghanistan and an associated project&#13;
         objective o f providing employment to locals), disruption or destruction o f habitat established&#13;
         close to facilities which are not being properly maintainedor operated.&#13;
    0    Operation Phase: Pollution by agrochemicals (fertilizer and pesticide), impacts on soils&#13;
         (waterlogging and salinization), changes in ground water table in the vicinity, changes in water&#13;
         quality and risks o f eutrophication, incidence o f water-borne and water-related diseases.&#13;
&#13;
Purpose of the Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework&#13;
&#13;
Since the activities under the project will concentrate on rehabilitation o f the existing infrastructure, the&#13;
adverse impacts commonly associated with new schemes - mainly arising from land-take will be very&#13;
limited. It i s also acknowledged that currently environmental management in Afghanistan i s a constraint.&#13;
But, since there is potential for adverse impacts, albeit limited, on the environment due to the proposed&#13;
activities under the project, their mitigation and management i s key to wholesome development o f the&#13;
areas where irrigation facilities are being rehabilitated. Hence, keepinginview the existing environmental&#13;
management capacity, as well as the flexibility required as not all investments are known at the time o f&#13;
project appraisal, a framework approach is adopted. It allows the early identification o f potential adverse&#13;
impacts, without the requirement o f rigorous analysis through quantification, due to individual sub-&#13;
projects and also provides broad guidance for their effective mitigation. Consistent with existing national&#13;
legislation, the objective o f the Framework i s to help ensure that activities under the project will:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0    Protect humanhealth;&#13;
    0    Prevent or compensate any loss o f livelihood;&#13;
    0    Prevent environmental degradation as a result o f either individual sub-projects or their cumulative&#13;
         effects;&#13;
    0    Enhance positive environmental and social outcomes; and&#13;
&#13;
    0    Ensure compliance with World Bank safeguardpolicies.&#13;
&#13;
General Principles&#13;
&#13;
Recognizingthe emergency nature o f the proposed rehabilitationproject, and the related need for&#13;
providing assistance, while at the same time ensuring due diligence inmanagingpotential environmental&#13;
and social risks, this Framework i s based on the following principles:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      (1)     The project will support multiple sub-projects, the detailed designs o f which may not be&#13;
              known at appraisal.     To ensure the effective application o f the World Bank's safeguard&#13;
              policies, the Framework provides guidance on the approach to be taken during&#13;
              implementation for the selection and design o f sub-projects, and the planning o f mitigation&#13;
              measures;&#13;
&#13;
     (ii) Allproposedsub-projectswillbescreenedtoensurethattheenvironmentalandsocialrisks&#13;
              can be adequately addressed through the applicationo f standardized guidelines;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       76&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
            The proposed emergency project will finance feasibility or pre-feasibility studies for&#13;
             subsequent investments, which will include environmental and social impact assessments, as&#13;
            required by World Bank safeguard policies;&#13;
&#13;
            Project design and sub-project selection will aim to maintain regional balance, and equity&#13;
            between genders, and ethnic and religious groups, considering variations in population&#13;
            density. Employment opportunities within the projects will be available on an equal basis to&#13;
            all, on the basis o f professional competence, irrespective o f gender, or ethnic or religious&#13;
            group. In all projects which require consultations with local communities or beneficiaries,&#13;
            consultations will be conducted to elicit the views o f both the male and the               female&#13;
            population; and&#13;
&#13;
            Consultation and disclosure requirements will be simplified to meet the special needs o f this&#13;
            project.     Prior to approval by the World Bank Board, this Environmental and Social&#13;
             Safeguards Framework will be disclosed inAfghanistan inDari and Pashto, and inthe World&#13;

             (see guidelines inAttachment 7).&#13;
             For the applicability o f OP 7.50, a waiver will be sought since the project will not create any&#13;
             new infrastructure and only rehabilitate existing facilities.&#13;
&#13;

Mitigationmeasures-Design&#13;
&#13;
Sound design will, if not eliminate, at least diminish to the extent possible, most o f the potential adverse&#13;
impacts o f project activities. Good engineering design will, in most cases, have a positive impact on the&#13;
environmental conditions in the project area. A cause o f concem are adverse impacts on local ecology,&#13;
especially where the current situation (impropednon-operation) has led to the creation o f habitat for&#13;
important flora/fauna species inthe project area. These situations will have to be considered on a case-by-&#13;
case basis. A pre-design walk-through o f the design team, with specialist environmental input, through&#13;
the project area will be a highly desirable exercise. Otherwise, local knowledge from other stakeholders&#13;
such as NGOs' and local residents may be tapped to ascertain that the project does not cause significant&#13;
damage to any important species. One aspect which deserves attention is the drafting o f the contract&#13;
documents where environmental protectioncan be built into the project agreements.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, the designers must take care of providing adequate drainage to avoid salinization and&#13;
waterlogging. Appurtenances required to operate the system must be easily maintainable and repairable&#13;
rather than sophisticated, especially in light o f the existing limited capacity o f the eventual users o f the&#13;
system. Co-ordination with the line departments, other stakeholders such as NGOs must begin in the&#13;
design phase itself. This will ensure that the project i s ready for mitigating impacts such as resettlement&#13;
and health service support, if required. The M&amp;E Unit o f the MrWRE will have to be mobilized at this&#13;
stage itselfto ensure that the measures envisaged as part o f this framework are implemented.&#13;
&#13;
Mitigationmeasures-Construction&#13;
&#13;
The emphasis o f the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) i s on construction stage impacts since the&#13;
operation stage impacts, as has already been stated before, can be minimized, mitigated or compensated&#13;
by managing the rehabilitated infi-astructure inline with project design parameters. Inorder to minimize&#13;
the potential adverse impacts o f construction, standard bidding documents would have the following&#13;
environmental precautionary clauses:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         0   The natural landscape should be preserved to the extent possible by conducting operations in&#13;
             a manners that will prevent unnecessary destruction or scarring o f natural surroundings.&#13;
             Except where required for permanent works, quarries, borrow pits, staging and processing&#13;
             areas, dumps, and camps, all trees, saplings, and shrubbery should be protected from&#13;
             unnecessary damage by project related activities. After unavoidable damage, to restore quasi-&#13;
             original conditions where appropriate;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         0   Contractor's operations should be so performed as to prevent accidental spillage o f&#13;
             contaminants, debris, or other pollutants, especially into streams or underground water&#13;
             resources. Such pollutants include untreated sewage and sanitary waste, tailings, petroleum&#13;
             products, chemical, biocides, mineral salts, and thermal pollution;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        0    Wastewater, including those from aggregate processing and concrete batching, must not enter&#13;
             streams without settling ponds, grave Ifilters, or other process, so as not to impair water&#13;
             quality or harm aquatic life;&#13;
        0    The contractor should ensure proper disposal o f waste materials and rubbish. If disposal by&#13;
             burial or fire, it should not cause negative impact to either the air, soil or ground water&#13;
             supplies;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        0    The contractor should minimize air and water pollution emissions. Dust from the handling or&#13;
             transporting o f aggregates, cement, etc., should be minimized by sprinklingor other methods.&#13;
&#13;
                                                      78&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
              Materials, brush or trees should only be burned when the owner permits, under favorable&#13;
              weather conditions;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         0    The contractor's facilities, such as warehouse, labor camps, and storage areas, should be&#13;
              planned in advance to decide what the area will look like upon completion of construction.&#13;
              These facilities should be located so as to preserve the natural environment (such as trees and&#13;
              other vegetation) to the maximumextent possible;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         0    After project construction, camps and building should either serve as permanent residences&#13;
              and form future communities, if such use can be fore seen and approved, or be torn down and&#13;
              the area restore to its quasi-original condition in order to avoid deterioration into shanty&#13;
              towns; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         0    Borrow pits should be landscaped and planted accordingly to an ecological design to provide&#13;
              some substitute area for lost natural landscapes and habitats.&#13;
&#13;
Responsibilitiesfor SafeguardScreeningandMitigation&#13;
&#13;
The overall responsibility o f project implementation rests with the Ministry o f Irrigation, Water&#13;
Resources and Environment (MIWRE), and the FA0 will act as the executing agency for the proposed&#13;
operations. A designated Safeguards Focal Officer has been identified with responsibility for overseeing&#13;
the implementation o f the Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework within the Program&#13;
Coordination Unit (PCU) at the MIWRE.An independent Monitoring and Evaluation unit with, inter alia,&#13;
environmental and social specialists' inputshas beenproposed within the MIWRE.&#13;
&#13;
Duringthe operation stage, the M&amp;E Unit will carry out the monitoring o f the operations also. It will&#13;
confirm (from anecdotal evidence and, if required, laboratory testing) that the water quality inthe project&#13;
area i s not adversely impacted due to agrochemicals, soil conditions are conducive for growth o f crops&#13;
normally grown inthe region, and pathogens and vectors are under control. Incase o f incidence o f water-&#13;
related or water-transmitted disease, it will co-ordinate with the local health department to ensure that the&#13;
situation i s brought under control inthe shortest possible time.&#13;
&#13;
CapacityBuilding&#13;
&#13;
As part o f the capacity buildingthat will be provided for implementationo f the proposed operations, the&#13;
Safeguards Focal Officer and relevant staff o f MIWREwill also receive training inthe application o f the&#13;
Safeguard Framework. It i s proposed that site visits be arranged to other countries in the region, on&#13;
similar projects in progress to provide hands-on training to the staff workmg as focal points in the&#13;
Ministryas well as at the PCU. Inaddition, for systematic capacity building, and to provide subsequent&#13;
guidance and review o f the application o f the Framework, MIRWE may contract from social and&#13;
environmental services specialists.       These may be initially housed in the MIWRE in Kabul and&#13;
occasionally carry out field visits to guide line department officials inthe regions. During supervision of&#13;
these operations, the World Bank will assess the implementation o f the Framework, and if required, will&#13;
recommend additional strengthening.&#13;
ConsultationandDisclosure&#13;
&#13;
This Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework was prepared in consultation with the principal&#13;
NGOs and development partners participating in reconstruction activities in Afghanistan. It has been&#13;
disclosed by TISA inboth Dari and Pashto, as well as English, and it has also been made available at the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       79&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
World Bank's Infoshop. It is worth noting that TISA intends to make all project documentation publicly&#13;
available through the Afghan Information Management System (AIMS).&#13;
&#13;
The proposed operations will support a number o f feasibility studies for future infrastructure investments,&#13;
for which World Bank safeguard policies relating to consultation and disclosure will apply, if they are&#13;
financed by IDA. Inparticular, for environmental Category A and B investments (as defined in World&#13;
bank Operational Policy 4.01, Environmental Assessment) proposed for future operations, the&#13;
implementing agency will consult project-affected groups and local non-governmental organizations&#13;
about the project's environmental and social aspects, and will take their views into account.           The&#13;
executing agency will initiate such consultations as early as possible, and for meaningful consultations,&#13;
will provide relevant material in a timely manner prior to consultation, in a form and language that are&#13;
understandable and accessible to the groups being consulted.&#13;

&#13;
          Guidelinesfor LandandAsset Acquisition,EntitlementsandCompensation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Objectives&#13;
&#13;
Land acquisition will be kept to a minimum and no person will be involuntarily displaced under sub-&#13;
projects financed by the proposed emergency project.             Sub-project proposals that would require&#13;
demolishing houses or acquiring productive land should be carefully reviewed to minimize or avoid their&#13;
impacts through alternative alignments. Proposals that require more than minor expansion along rights o f&#13;
way should be reviewed carefully.         No land or asset acquisition may take place outside o f these&#13;
guidelines. A format for LandAcquisition Assessment i s attached as Attachment 2(i).&#13;
&#13;
These guidelines provide principles and instructions to compensate affected persons to ensure that all&#13;
such persons negatively affected, regardless o f their land tenure status, will be assisted to improve, or at&#13;
least to restore, their livingstandards, income earning or production capacity to pre-project levels.&#13;
&#13;
Categorization&#13;
&#13;
Based on the number o f persons that may be affected by the project (Project Affected People, PAPs) and&#13;
the magnitude o f impacts, projects may be categorized as S-1, S-2, or S-3 projects:&#13;
&#13;
                S-1 projects are those that will involve the resettlement o f more than 200 PAPs and where a&#13;
               full Resettlement Action Plan (RAE') must be produced.             Such interventions will be&#13;
               ineligible for support under the proposed emergency project.&#13;
&#13;
                S-2 projects are those which will involve the resettlement o f less than 200 persons. In such&#13;
               cases, the following documentation i s required: (i)    a land acquisition assessment, (ii)the&#13;
               Minutes or record of consultations which assess the compensation claimed and agreement&#13;
               reached, and (iii)  a record o f the receipt o f the compensation, or voluntary donation, by&#13;
               those affected (see below).&#13;
&#13;
                S-3 projects are not expected to have any land acquisition or any other significant adverse&#13;
               social impacts; on the contrary, significant positive social impact and improved livelihoods&#13;
               are expected from such interventions.&#13;
                                                                                            . )&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PAPs are identifiedas persons whose livelihood is directly or indirectly affectedby the project. PAPs&#13;
deemed eligible for compensation are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         (1)   those who have formal legal rightsto land, water resources or structureshuildings,&#13;
               including recognized customary and traditional rights;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         (2)   those who do not have such formal legal rightsbut have a claim to usufruct right rootedin&#13;
               customary law; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         (3)   those whose claim to land and water resources or buildinghtructures do not fall within (1)&#13;
               and (2) above, are eligible to assistance to restore their livelihood.&#13;
&#13;
                                                       82&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Acquisition ofProductiveAssets and Compensation&#13;
&#13;
PAPSare eligible for replacement costs for lost assets as described below:&#13;
&#13;
     a)  Voluntary contributions. In accordance with traditional practices, individuals may elect to&#13;
         voluntarily contribute land or assets andor relocate temporarily or permanently from their land&#13;
         without compensation.&#13;
&#13;
     b) Contributions against compensation. A contributorlasset loser considered "affected" will be&#13;
         eligible for compensation from the local community or alternatively fi-om the Government. A&#13;
         PAP shall lodge hisher claim for compensation to the local community representativeshhura&#13;
         head and it shall be verified by the implementing agency. The claim shall be lodged within 2&#13;
         weeks o f completion o f the consultations with the concerned community, and before project&#13;
         implementationbegins.&#13;
&#13;
Voluntary contribution,      or contribution against compensation,          should be documented.         The&#13;
documentation should specify that the landi s free o f any squatters, encroachers or other claims. A format&#13;
i s attached in Attachment 2(i), which includes a Schedule to be followed to assess any compensation&#13;
claimed and the agreement reached.&#13;
&#13;
CompensationPrinciples&#13;
&#13;
The project implementing agencies shall ensure that any o f the following means o f compensation are&#13;
provided ina timely manner to affected persons:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(1)      Project affected persons losing access to a portion o f their land or other productive assets with the&#13;
         remaining assets being economically viable are entitled to compensation at replacement cost for&#13;
         that portion o f land or assets lost to them. Compensation for the lost assets will be according to&#13;
         following principles:&#13;
&#13;
         a.      replacement land with an equally productive plot, cash or other equivalent productive&#13;
                 assets;&#13;
         b.      materials and assistance to fully replace solid structures that will be demolished;&#13;
         c.      replacement o f damaged or lost crops and trees, at market value;&#13;
         d.      other acceptable in-kindcompensation; and&#13;
         e.      incaseo fcashcompensation, the delivery o fcompensation shouldbemade inpublic, i.e.&#13;
                 at the community meeting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(2)      Project affected persons losing access to a portion o f their land or other economic assets&#13;
         rendering the remainder economically non-viable, will have the options o f compensation for the&#13;
         entire asset by provision o f alternative land, cash or equivalent productive asset, according to the&#13;
         principlesin(1) a-d above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ConsultationProcess&#13;
&#13;
The implementing agencies will ensure that all occupants o f land and owners o f assets located in a&#13;
proposed sub-project area are consulted. There will be gender-separate community meetings for each&#13;
affected village to inform the local population about their rights to compensation and options available in&#13;
accordance with these Guidelines. The Minutes o f the community meetings shall reflect the discussions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       83&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
held, agreements reached, and include details o f the agreement, based on the format provided in&#13;
Attachment 2(ii).&#13;
&#13;
The implementing agency shall provide a copy o f the Minutes to affected persons and confirm in&#13;
discussions with each o f them their requests and preferences for compensation, agreements reached, and&#13;
any eventual complaint. Copies will be recorded inthe posted project documentation and be available for&#13;
inspection duringsupervision.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-project Approval&#13;
&#13;
Inthe event that a sub-project involvesacquisition against compensation, the implementingagency shall:&#13;
&#13;
         a. not approve the sub-project unless a satisfactory compensation has been agreed between the&#13;
              affected person and the local community;&#13;
         b. not allow works to start untilthe compensation has been delivered ina satisfactory manner to&#13;
              the affected persons; and&#13;
         c.   if more than 200 persons are affected and require compensation, the sub-project shall be&#13;
              deemed ineligible for support under the emergency project.&#13;
&#13;
Complaints and Grievances&#13;
&#13;
All complaints should first be negotiated to reach an agreement at the local community/village level. If&#13;
this fails, complaints and grievances about these Guidelines, implementation of the agreements recorded&#13;
in the Community Meeting Minutes or any alleged irregularity in carrying out the project can also be&#13;
addressed by the affected persons or their representative at the municipal or district level. Ifthis also fails,&#13;
the complaint may be submitted to the relevant implementing agency for a decision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Verification&#13;
&#13;
The Community Meeting Minutes, including agreements o f compensation and evidence o f compensation&#13;
having been made shall be provided to the Municipality/district, to the supervising engineers, who will&#13;
maintain a record hereof, and to auditors and socio-economic monitors when they undertake reviews and&#13;
post-project assessment. This process shall be specified in all relevant project documents, including&#13;
details o f the relevant authority for complaints at municipal/district or implementing agency level.&#13;

                                       Protectionof CulturalProperty&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Physical culture includes monuments, structures, works o f art, or sites o f "outstanding universal value"&#13;
from the historical, aesthetic, scientific, ethnological, or anthropological point o f view, including&#13;
unrecorded graveyards and burial sites. Within this broader definition, cultural property i s defined as&#13;
sites and structures having archaeological, paleontological, historical, architectural, or religious&#13;
significance, and natural sites with cultural values.&#13;
&#13;
The proposed emergency project i s unlikely to pose a risk o f damaging cultural property, as the sub-&#13;
projects will consist of small investments for rehabilitating existing irrigation schemes. Further, the&#13;
negative list o f attributes, which would make a sub-project ineligible for support (Attachment l),    includes&#13;
any activity that would significantly damage non-replicable cultural property. Nevertheless, the following&#13;
procedures for identification, protection from theft, and treatment o f chance finds should be followed and&#13;
included in standard bid documents.&#13;
&#13;
ChanceFindProcedures&#13;
&#13;
Chance find procedures are defined in the law on Maintenance o f Historical and Cultural Monuments&#13;
(Official Gazette, December 21, 1980), specifying the authorities and responsibilities o f cultural heritage&#13;
agencies if sites or materials are discovered inthe course o f project implementation. This law establishes&#13;
that all moveable and immovable historical and cultural artifacts are state property, and further:&#13;
&#13;
    1. The responsibility for preservation, maintenance and assessment o f historical and cultural&#13;
         monuments rests with the Archaeological Committee under the Ministry o f Information and&#13;
         Culture, which has representation at provincial level.&#13;
&#13;
    2. Whenever chance finds o f cultural or historical artifacts (moveable and immovable) are made the&#13;
         Archaeological Committee should be informed. Should the continuation o f work endanger the&#13;
         historical and cultural artifacts, the project work should be suspended until a solution i s found for&#13;
         the preservation o f these artifacts.&#13;
&#13;
    3. If a moveable or immovable historical or cultural artifact i s found in the countryside o f a&#13;
         province, the provincial governor (wali) or district-in-charge (woluswal) should be informed&#13;
         within two weeks, and they shouldinformthe Archaeological Committee. Incase the immovable&#13;
         historical or cultural artifact i s found in a city, the provincial branch o f the Department o f&#13;
         Maintenance o f Historical Values o f the Ministry o f Information and Culture should be informed&#13;
         within two weeks (art. IS).     Ifthe find is made within the center, the Archaeological Committee&#13;
         mustbe informed directly within one week (art. 25).&#13;
&#13;
    4. Failure to report a chance find within the stipulated time limit will be punished with a fine or&#13;
         imprisonment for a period o f one week or up to one month (art. 72).&#13;
&#13;
    5. If someone intentionally damages a historical or cultural artifact, the culprit shall pay&#13;
         compensation in accordance with the value o f the artifact plus be imprisoned for a period o f one&#13;
         month to ten years depending on the gravity o f the crime (art. 71).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Incase o f a chance find of moveable or immovable historical or cultural artifact, the implementing&#13;
agency is responsible for securing the artifact from theft, pilferage and damage untilthe responsibility&#13;
has been taken over by the relevant authorities as specified above.&#13;
&#13;
These procedures must be referred to as standard provisions in construction contracts, when&#13;
applicable. During project supervision, the Site Engineer shall monitor that the above regulations&#13;
relating to the treatment o f any chance find encountered are observed.&#13;
&#13;
Relevant findings will be recorded in World Bank Project Supervision Reports (PSRs), and&#13;
Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) will assess the overall effectiveness o f the project's&#13;
cultural resources mitigation, management, and capacity buildingactivities, as appropriate.&#13;

Introduction&#13;
&#13;
Since the Loya Jirga in 2002, a new Afghanistan i s being built by the concerted efforts o f the Afghan&#13;
people. The Government o f Afghanistan (GOA)intends to upgrade and expand its irrigation and drainage&#13;
infrastructure to enhance the livelihood earning capacity o f its people sustainably. For achieving this&#13;
objective, it has decided to take up several large irrigation schemes for up gradation and several new&#13;
schemes have also been proposed. GOAwants that the proposed development occurs with due regard for&#13;
the environmental and social concerns associated with such development. GOA'Sapex body on the&#13;
subject, Ministry o f Irrigation, Water Resources and Environment (MIWRE), wishes to engage the&#13;
services o f a consultant to carry out the Environmental Impact Assessment o f large / new schemes during&#13;
the project preparation stage to ensure that these key concerns are addressed early inproject development.&#13;
While the MIWRE i s the nodal ministry for the project, inputs are also expected from the Ministry o f&#13;
Agriculture and Animal Husbandry and Ministry o f Rehabilitationand Rural Development.&#13;
&#13;
Project Background&#13;
&#13;
The Government o f Afghanistan i s to avail IDA credit for the rehabilitation o f its irrigation infrastructure&#13;
spread across the country. The proposed multi-component Emergency Irrigation Rehabilitation Project&#13;
(EIRP) aims to improve irrigation infrastructure using a river-basin approach. One component o f this&#13;
project i s also financing preparation o f feasibility studies for large irrigation schemes which may be taken&#13;
up inthe future. As part o f the EIRP, detailed Environmental Impact Assessments are to be carried out&#13;
for candidate largehew projects identified, to feed into the overall project preparation. The XYZ project&#13;
i s being prepared as part o f this component. {Provide a plan of the area that will be affected either&#13;
indirectly or directly. Basic data should be given on existing andproposed irrigation and drainage in the&#13;
area and the catchments characteristics, ifavailable. 1&#13;
&#13;
Objectives&#13;
&#13;
This study is being carried out to ensure that environmental implications o f the proposed XYZ project&#13;
have been identified, analyzed and clearly communicated to the decision makers. Inorder to achieve this&#13;
target, the following objectives have been set:&#13;
    a. To prepare inventory o f the biophysical and socio-economic environmental attributes inthe study&#13;
         area;&#13;
    b. To involve the local population inproject preparation through active consultations which could&#13;
         also assist inidentifying the attributes important to them;&#13;
    c. To identify and assess the magnitude and significance o f impacts due to the proposed activities on&#13;
         the attributes identified;&#13;
    d. To consider a range o f proposals should be considered and if so whether they would be less&#13;
         environmentally damaging;&#13;
    e. To propose avoidance, mitigation and enhancement measures for adverse and positive impacts;&#13;
    f. To assess the current capacity for environmental management to develop institutional&#13;
         arrangements for this and subsequent (like) projects; and&#13;
    g. To prepare an environmental management plan to ensure implementation o f the management&#13;
         measures selected from the ones proposed, along with budgetary allocation (to feed into the&#13;
         overall project cost estimates) and institutional responsibility.&#13;
&#13;

Tusk 5. Analysis of Alternatives to the Project. Describe alternatives that were examined inthe course of&#13;
developing the project and identify other alternatives which would achieve the same objectives. The&#13;
concept o f alternatives extends to siting, design, technology selection, construction techniques and&#13;
phasing, and operating and maintenance procedures. Compare alternatives in terms o f potential&#13;
environmental impacts; capital and operating costs; suitability under local conditions; and institutional,&#13;
training, and monitoring requirements. When describing the impacts, indicate which are irreversible or&#13;
unavoidable and which can be mitigated. To the extent possible, quantify the costs and benefits o f each&#13;
alternative, incorporating the estimated costs o f any associated mitigating measures. Include the&#13;
alternative o f not constructing the project, inorder to demonstrate environmental conditions without it.&#13;
&#13;
Tusk 6. Development of Environmental Management Plan, with focus on three generic areas: Mitigation&#13;
measures, institutional strengthening and training, and monitoring. The emphasis on each o f these areas&#13;
depends on the needs inthe specific project context, as identifiedby the EA itself.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0      Mitigation o f environmental impact:       Recommend feasible and cost-effective measures to&#13;
           prevent or reduce significant negative impacts to acceptable levels. Estimate the impacts and&#13;
           costs of those measures. Consider compensation to affected parties for impacts which cannot be&#13;
           mitigated. The plan should include proposed work programs, budget estimates, schedules,&#13;
           staffing and training requirements, and other necessary support services to implement the&#13;
           mitigating measures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0      Institutional strengthening and training:     Identification o f institutional needs to implement&#13;
           environmental assessment recommendations. Review the authority and capability o f institutions&#13;
           at local, provincial/regional, and national levels and recommend steps to strengthen or expand&#13;
           them so that the management and monitoring plans in the environmental assessment can be&#13;
           implemented. The recommendations may extend to new laws and regulations, new agencies or&#13;
           agency functions, intersectoral arrangements, management procedures and training, staffing,&#13;
           operation and maintenance training, budgeting, and financial support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0      Monitoring:     Prepare detailed arrangements for monitoring implementation o f mitigating&#13;
           measures and the impacts of the project during construction and operation. Include in the plan&#13;
           an estimate o f capital and operating costs and a description o f other inputs(such as training and&#13;
           institutional strengthening) neededto carry it out.&#13;
&#13;
Tusk 7. Assist in Inter-Agency Coordination and PublicNGO Participation. Assist in coordinating the&#13;
environmental assessment with other government agencies, in obtaining the views o f local NGO's and&#13;
affected groups, and inkeeping records of meetings and other activities, communications, and comments&#13;
and their disposition.&#13;

          peoples development plan {see also subpara. (h)(v) below}. Normally includes a map&#13;
          showing the project site and the project's area of influence.&#13;
&#13;
          Baseline data. Assesses the dimensions o f the study area and describes relevant physical,&#13;
          biological, and socioeconomic conditions, including any changes anticipated before the&#13;
          project commences. Also takes into account current and proposed development activities&#13;
          within the project area but not directly connected to the project. Data should be relevant to&#13;
          decisions about project location, design, operation, or mitigatory measures. The section&#13;
          indicates the accuracy, reliability, and sources o f the data.&#13;
&#13;
          Environmental impacts. Predicts and assesses the project's likely positive and negative&#13;
          impacts, inquantitative terms to the extent possible. Identifies mitigation measures and any&#13;
          residual negative impacts that cannot be mitigated. Explores opportunities for&#13;
          environmental enhancement. Identifies and estimates the extent and quality o f available&#13;
          data, key data gaps, and uncertainties associated with predictions, and specifies topics that&#13;
          do not require further attention.&#13;
&#13;
          Analysis of alternatives. Systematically compares feasible altematives to the project site,&#13;
          technology, design, and operation-including      the "without project" situation-in   terms o f&#13;
          their potential environmental impacts; the feasibility o f mitigating these impacts; their&#13;
          capital and recurrent costs; their suitability under local conditions; and their institutional,&#13;
          training, and monitoring requirements. For each o f the altematives, quantifies the&#13;
          environmental impacts to the extent possible, and attaches economic values where feasible.&#13;
          States the basis for selecting the particular project design proposed and justifies&#13;
          recommended emission levels and approaches to pollution prevention and abatement.&#13;

&#13;
(111) Environmental Management Plan: The consultant will submit an environmentalmanagement plan&#13;
      (inline withAnnex C ofOP4.01) whichwill includethe following components.&#13;
&#13;
            Mitigation The EMP identifies feasible and cost-effective measures that may reduce&#13;
            potentially significant adverse environmental impacts to acceptable levels. The plan&#13;
            includes compensatory measures if mitigation measures are not feasible, cost-effective, or&#13;
             sufficient.&#13;
&#13;
            Monitoring Environmental monitoring duringproject implementation provides information&#13;
             about key environmental aspects o f the project, particularly the environmental impacts of&#13;
            the project and the effectiveness o f mitigation measures. Such information enables the&#13;
            borrower and the Bank to evaluate the success o f mitigation as part o f project supervision,&#13;
             and allows corrective action to be taken when needed. Therefore, the EMP identifies&#13;
            monitoring objectives and specifies the type o f monitoring, with linkages to the impacts&#13;
             assessedinthe EAreport and the mitigation measures described inthe EMP.&#13;
&#13;
             Capacity Development and Training To support timely and effective implementation o f&#13;
            environmental project components and mitigation measures, the EMP draws on the EA'S&#13;
            assessment o f the existence, role, and capability o f environmental units on site or at the&#13;
             agency and ministry level.     If necessary, the EMP recommends the establishment or&#13;
            expansion o f such units, and the training o f staff, to allow implementation o f EA&#13;
            recommendations. Specifically, the EMP provides a specific description o f institutional&#13;
            arrangements-who      i s responsible for carrying out the mitigatory and monitoring measures&#13;
             (e.g., for operation, supervision, enforcement, monitoring o f implementation, remedial&#13;
            action, financing, reporting, and staff training). To strengthen environmental management&#13;
            capability inthe agencies responsible for implementation, most EMPs cover one or more o f&#13;
            the following additional topics: (a) technical assistance programs, (b) procurement o f&#13;
            equipment and supplies, and (c) organizational changes.&#13;
&#13;
            Implementation Schedule and Cost Estimates For all three aspects (mitigation, monitoring,&#13;
            and capacity development), the EMP provides (a) an implementation schedule for measures&#13;
            that must be carried out as part o f the project, showing phasing and coordination with&#13;
            overall project implementation plans; and (b) the capital and recurrent cost estimates and&#13;
            sources of funds for implementing the EMP. These figures are also integrated into the total&#13;
            project cost tables.&#13;
&#13;
            Integration of EMP with Project The borrower's decision to proceedwith a project, and the&#13;
            Bank's decision to support it, are predicated inpart on the expectation that the EMP will be&#13;
            executed effectively. Consequently, the Bank expects the plan to be specific in its&#13;
&#13;
                                                    99&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
               description o f the individual mitigation and monitoring measures and its assignment o f&#13;
               institutional responsibilities, and it must be integrated into the project's overall planning,&#13;
               design, budget, and implementation. Such integration i s achieved by establishing the EMP&#13;
               within the project/contract documents so that the plan will receive funding and supervision&#13;
               along with the other components.&#13;

  Proceduresfor Mine RiskManagementin World Bank-FundedProjectsin Afghanistan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Background:&#13;
&#13;
The following procedures are designed to respond to the risks caused by the presence o f mines in&#13;
Afghanistan, inthe context of:&#13;
    0   ~ommunityrehabilitation / construction works to be identified and implemented by the&#13;
        communities themselves (for small projects o f up to $100,000 each);&#13;
    0   Small and medium-size works to be identified by local authorities and implemented by local&#13;
        contractors (for projects up to $5m each);&#13;
&#13;
    0   Works to be implemented directly by Government departments/agencies, without use o f&#13;
        contractors;&#13;
    0   Large works to be implementedby contractors (for projects above $5m);&#13;
&#13;
General comment applying to all following procedures: All risk assessment and clearance tasks shall be&#13;
implemented in coordination with the Mine Action Center for Afghanistan (MACA). These procedures&#13;
may need to be amended inthe future depending on evolving circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Procedurefor Community-ManagedWorks&#13;
&#13;
Applicability: This procedure applies to community rehabilitatiodconstction works to be identified and&#13;
implementedby the communities themselves (for small projects o f upto $100,000 each).&#13;
&#13;
Overall approach: The communities should be responsible for making sure that the projects they propose&#13;
are not in mine-contaminated areas, or have been cleared by M A C A (or a mine action organization&#13;
accredited by MACA).&#13;
&#13;
Rationale: Communities are best placed to know about mined areas in their vicinity, and have a strong&#13;
incentive to report them accurately as they will carry out the works themselves.&#13;
&#13;
Procedure:&#13;
&#13;
1. Communities are required to submit a reply to a questionnaire regarding the suspected presence of&#13;
mines in the area where Bank-funded community-managed projects will be implemented.                  This&#13;
questionnaire should be formally endorsed by the Mine Action Program for Afghanistan(MAPA). It will&#13;
be a mandatory attachment to the project submission by the communities and should be signed by&#13;
community representatives and the external project facilitator. External project facilitators will receive&#13;
training fiom MAPA. Financing agreements with the communities should make clear that communities&#13;
are solely liable incase o f a mine-related accident.&#13;
&#13;
2. Ifthe community certifies that there is no known mine contamination in the area, the ministry&#13;
responsible for the selection o f projects should check with MACA whether any different observation is&#13;
reportedon MACA's data base.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     101&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
             o If MACA's information is the same, the project can go ahead for selection.                The&#13;
                 community takes the full responsibility for the assessment, and extemal organizations&#13;
                 cannot be made liable incase of an accident.&#13;
&#13;
             o IfMACA's information is different, the project should not go ahead for selection as long&#13;
                 as MACA's and community's statements have not beenreconciled.&#13;
&#13;
3. Ifthe community suspects mine contamination inthe area,&#13;
&#13;
             o If the community has included an assessmenthlearance task in the project agreed to be&#13;
                 implemented by M A C A (or by a mine action organization accredited by MACA), the&#13;
                 project can go ahead for selection.&#13;
&#13;
             o Ifthe community has not includedan assessmenthlearance task inthe project, the project&#13;
                 should not go ahead for selection as long as this has not been corrected.&#13;
&#13;
             o Mine clearance tasks must be implementedby MACA or by a mine action organization&#13;
                 accredited by MACA. Communities will be penalized (subsequent funding by World-&#13;
                 Bank funded projects shall be reduced or cancelled) if they elect to clear mines on their&#13;
                 Own.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Procedurefor Small andMedium-sizeWorks Contracted Out&#13;
&#13;
Applicability: This procedure applies to small- and medium-size works to be identified by local&#13;
authorities andimplementedby local contractors (for projects up to $5m each).&#13;
&#13;
Overall approach: MACA (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) should provide detailed&#13;
information on the mine-related risks (either based onpreviously done and updated general survey or on a&#13;
new general survey) before projects are considered for selection. Only project sites assessedto have a nil-&#13;
to-low risk would be eligible for selection, unless they have been demined by MACA or by a mine action&#13;
organization accredited by MACA.&#13;
&#13;
Rationale: Neither local authorities nor local contractors have the capacity to assess the mine-related risks&#13;
ina systematic way, while they mayhave incentivesto underestimatethem.&#13;
&#13;
Procedure:&#13;
&#13;
    1, Prior to puttingup a project for selection, a general survey shouldbe carriedout by MACA (or a&#13;
         mine action organization accredited by MACA) to assess mine-related risks in the area o f the&#13;
         project (this shouldinclude checkmginformation available inthe MACA data base).&#13;
&#13;
    2. IfMACA provides information suggesting a nil-to-low riskin the project area, the project can go&#13;
         ahead for selection.&#13;
&#13;
    3.   The contract between the responsible ministry and the contractor will include a clause stating that&#13;
         incaseofanaccident, legalliability wouldbefully andsolelybomebythe contractor.&#13;
&#13;
    4.   IfMACA assesses a potentially highrisk inthe area (whether due to the presence of mines or&#13;
         uncertainty),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     102&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
             o Ifthe project includes an assessmentlclearance task agreed to be implementedby M A C A&#13;
                 (or by a mine action organization accredited by MACA), it can go ahead for selection&#13;
                 based on agreed funding modalities (clearance may be funded either under a contract&#13;
                 with a Bank-funded project or under existing donor agreements with the mine action&#13;
                 organization);&#13;
&#13;
            o If the project does not include an assessment/clearance task, it should not go ahead for&#13;
                 selection as long as this has not been corrected.&#13;
&#13;
Procedure for Works to be implementeddirectly by Government DepartmentdAgencies, without&#13;
use of contractors&#13;
&#13;
Applicability: This procedure applies to works to be implemented directly by Government&#13;
departments/agencies, without use o f contractors.&#13;
&#13;
Overall approach: M A C A (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) should provide detailed&#13;
information on the mine-related risks (either based onpreviously done and updated general survey or on a&#13;
new general survey) before works or installation o f gooddmaterials are carried out in any given area.&#13;
Work would only be allowed to proceed in areas assessedto have a nil-to-low risk, unless they have been&#13;
deminedby a mine action organization accredited by M A C A .&#13;
&#13;
Rationale: Govemment departments and agencies responsible for providing services currently do not&#13;
have the capacity to assess the mine-related risks in a systematic way, and currently follow a process o f&#13;
consultingwith MACAprior to carrying out activities.&#13;
&#13;
Procedure:&#13;
&#13;
1.      Prior to carrying out work, the Government department/agency will consult with MACA to assess&#13;
mine-related risks in the area (this should include checkmg information available in the MACA data&#13;
base). If not already done, a general survey should be carried out by MACA (or by a mine action&#13;
organization accredited by MACA) to assess mine-related risks inthe area.&#13;
&#13;
2.      IfMACAprovides detailed information onmine-related risks which suggest a nil-to-low risk in&#13;
the proposed area, the work can proceed. The Government would be solely liable in case o f a mine-&#13;
related accident.&#13;
&#13;
3.      If information provided by MACA cannot support the assessment of a nil-to-low risk in the&#13;
proposed area (whether due to the presence o f mines or uncertainty), works should not go ahead before&#13;
M A C A (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) carries out the necessary further assessment&#13;
and/or clearance for risks to be downgraded to nil-to-low, based on agreed fundingmodalities (clearance&#13;
may be funded either under a contract with a Bank-funded project or under existing donor agreements&#13;
with the mine actionorganization).&#13;
&#13;
Procedure for Large Works Using Contractors&#13;
&#13;
Applicability: This procedure applies to large works to be implemented by large contractors (projects&#13;
above $5m).&#13;
&#13;
Overall approach: The main contractor should be responsible for dealing with mine-related risks, in&#13;
coordination with the UNMine Action Center.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     103&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Procedure:&#13;
&#13;
1.   As part o f the preparation o f the bidding documents, a general survey should be carried out by&#13;
     M A C A (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) on all the areas where contractors&#13;
     may have to work (broadly defined). This survey should provide detailed information on mine-&#13;
     related risks in the various areas allowing for an un-ambiguous identification o f areas that have a&#13;
     nil-to-low risk o f mine/UXO contamination and areas where the risk i s either higher or unknown.&#13;
     The survey shouldbe financed out o f the preparation costs o f the biddingdocuments.&#13;
&#13;
2.   All survey information should be communicated to the bidders (with sufficient legalcaveats so that&#13;
     it does not entail any liability), as information for the planning o f their activities (e.g., location o f&#13;
     campsites, access roads to quarries).&#13;
&#13;
3.   Depending on the nature and location o f the project and on the available risk assessment, two&#13;
     different options can be used.&#13;
&#13;
Option 1 Mine-clearance activities are part of the general contract&#13;
         -&#13;
&#13;
   a. Based on the general survey results, a specific budget provision for mine action during&#13;
   construction i s set aside as a separate provisional sum in the tender documents for the general&#13;
   contract.&#13;
&#13;
   b. As a separately identified item in their bid, the bidders include a provision for a further detailed&#13;
   mine assessment and clearance duringconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
   c. On the instruction o f the Supervision Engineer and drawing on the specific provisional sum for&#13;
   mine action in the contract, the contractor uses one o f several nominated sub-contractors (or a mine&#13;
   action organization accredited by MACA) to be rapidly available on call, to carry out assessment&#13;
   prior to initiation o f physical works inpotentially contaminated areas, and to conduct clearance tasks&#13;
   as he finds may be needed. The Contractor may also hire an intemational specialist to assist him in&#13;
   preparing and supervising these tasks. The Contractor i s free to chose which o f the accredited sub-&#13;
   contractors to use, and he i s fully responsible for the quality o f the works and i s solely liable in case&#13;
   of accident after an area has been demined.&#13;
&#13;
   d. To avoid an "over-use" o f the budget provision, the Contractor is required to inform the&#13;
       Supervision Engineer in writing (with a clear justification of the works to be carried out) well in&#13;
       advance o f mobilizing the mine-clearing team. The Supervision Engineer has the capacity to&#13;
       object to such works.&#13;
&#13;
Option 2 Mine-clearance activities are carried out under a separate contract&#13;
         -&#13;
&#13;
       a.   Specific, separately-awarded contracts are issued for further surveying andor clearing o f&#13;
           areas with a not-nil-to-low risk (under the supervision o f the Engineer) by specialized&#13;
           contractors (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA). The definition o f the areas&#13;
           to be further surveyed / cleared should be limited to those areas where any contractor would&#13;
           have to work, and should not include areas such as camp sites and quarriedmaterial sites&#13;
           which are to be identified by the Contractor during and after bidding o f the works. As a&#13;
           result o f these further surveys and possibly clearance works, mine-related risk in the entire&#13;
           contract area i s downgraded to nil-to-low.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    104&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        b. The contract with the general Contractor specifies the extent o fthe portion ofthe construction&#13;
            site o f which the Contractor i s to be given possession from time to time, clearly indicating&#13;
            restrictions o f access to areas where the mine riski s not nil-to-low. It also indicates the target&#13;
            dates at which these areas will be accessible. Following receipt of the notice to commence&#13;
            works from the Engineer, the Contractor can start work inall other areas.&#13;

&#13;
Introduction&#13;
&#13;
Water Resources. The Central mountain ranges o f Hindukush,Baba and Sefid KuhinAfghanistan serve&#13;
as internal and external water source for the country and its neighbors. Afghanistan has an arid to semi-&#13;
arid continental climate with low annual average precipitation o f less than 300 mm. Precipitation in-&#13;
creases with elevation, occurs from October to May with peaks inMarch and April, and i s stored inform&#13;
o f snow at elevations above 1,500 m. Above 4,500 m, glaciers are covering some 4,000 km2o f land. The&#13;
available renewable water resources o f the country are estimated to be in the order o f 60,000 million m3,&#13;
o f which 45,000 million m3i s surface water and 15,000 million m3groundwater. River flow increases in&#13;
spring, culminating inMay to July due to snow melt, and recedes to its base flow inOctober/November.&#13;
Major floods occur in MarchJApril, when intensive rainfall coincides with early snow melt caused by&#13;
rising temperatures. Four years o f drought (1999-2002) have significantly depleted alluvial aquifers&#13;
decreasing groundwater levels and base flows o frivers and streams to a historic low.&#13;
&#13;
Hydro-meteorological observation. In order to make best use o f the country's water resources and&#13;
ensure their sustainable management, the collection and analysis o f hydrological and meteorological data&#13;
i s essential . The basis for this i s an observation network o f hydrological (river gauge) and meteorological&#13;
("weather") stations where the most important parameters, determining spatial and temporal availability&#13;
and variability o f water, are measured. The analyzed data are used for the identificationandpreparationo f&#13;
water resources projects, such as irrigation scheme rehabilitation, potable water supply and hydropower&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;
Justification. The need to ensure proper design o f the projects and sustainable use o f the water resources&#13;
has been identified to be crucial for achieving the restoration o f imgated agriculture. Hence, hydrological&#13;
and meteorological data are required for proper planning.             In addition, regular annual floods, the&#13;
difficulties encounteredinquantifying their negative impact and the necessary mitigation measures during&#13;
the recent drought have emphasized these needs. Hydrological activities in Afghanistan ceased between&#13;
1978-1980. Historical data are, therefore, only available until 1978, some until 1980, but they are not&#13;
likely to be representative for the current conditions due to possible climatic changes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Current Status of Data Collection and Availability&#13;
&#13;
A certain number of observation stations was installedinthe 1940s .More stations were installedlater on&#13;
until the Seventies. The technology useduntil the late Seventies for operating the observation network&#13;
was that o f the Fifties and Sixties. Nevertheless, a dense system o f simple hydrological measurement&#13;
stations, combined with meteorological stations, was maintained for more than 30 years. At 167&#13;
hydrological stations, water flow was measured up to 1978, and historical data are published up to that&#13;
date.&#13;
&#13;
The hydrological network was managed by the Hydrology Department o f the Ministry o f Irrigation and&#13;
Power. The meteorological network was and i s managed by the Meteorology Department o f the Ministry&#13;
&#13;
                                                        106&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
o f Aviation and Transport. In addition, an agro-meteorological network was and i s managed by the&#13;
Ministry o f Agriculture, assisted by the Meteorology Department o f the Ministry o f Aviation and&#13;
Transport. Available historic data were recently digitized to be used for some preliminary assessment o f&#13;
the water resources, adjusted for considering the lower available amount o f water in the country during&#13;
the past 25 years.&#13;
&#13;
Among the 167 stations, 50 were located in the Indus Basin, 55 in the Sistan (HelmandArghandab)&#13;
Basin, 19 in the basin o f the westward flowing rivers (Har-i Rud and others), 19 in the basin o f the&#13;
northward flowing rivers ("blind rivers") and 24 inthe Amu river basin.&#13;
&#13;
Typical equipment and supplies for the hydrological stations were items such as water level recorder&#13;
(Stevens A-35 Model), current meter, pigmy meter, bridge bomm, D-49 sampler + cable suspension reel,&#13;
DH-48 wading sampler, DH-59 hand line crossing cable, Stevens recording charts, reel, stop watch, tag&#13;
line, enameled staff gauge, car puller, sounding weight o f 30, 50, 75, and 100 lbs, tool box, life jackets,&#13;
measurement sheets, recorder ink, current meter oil, float 23, thermometer, snow survey equipment, rain&#13;
gauge comalone, and sleeping bag. It i s important to note that not all o f these items were available at the&#13;
stations, as most o f the equipment was stored in the regional offices o f the Ministry o f Irrigation and&#13;
Power, and used when the teams were dispatched for various measurement exercises.&#13;
&#13;
Inaddition, eachregional office inKunduz, Kandahar, Kabul, andHerat was equipped with a laboratory&#13;
suitable for the analysis o f sediment samples taken from rivers and streams for the purpose o f quantifying&#13;
their bed and wash load. Equipment and tools used in these laboratories were such items as an electric&#13;
oven, sample bottles, vacuum pump, sensitive electrical scales, sediment cup, PHmeter, scale for sample&#13;
bottles, filtration paper, box for sediment bottles, electric markers, pepit, thermometer, filtration regulator,&#13;
sand for regulator, brushes for cleaning the sample bottles, calculator, scotch tape, conductivity meter,&#13;
and flame photometer.&#13;
&#13;
The list for the 167 hydrological stations in Afghanistan i s provided in Table 4. In addition, 11 more&#13;
hydrological stations are supposed to exist but are not included in the list provided by the Ministry o f&#13;
Imgation, Water Resources and Environment (MIWRE). They are listed below (Table 1) and their&#13;
(former) existence and potential use needs to be verified inthe field.&#13;

Hydro-meteorological observation network design&#13;
&#13;
Data Requirement and Network Objectives&#13;
&#13;
The objectives o f the proposed hydro-meteorological observation network i s to provide accurate data for&#13;
analysis, such as&#13;
             Water resources assessment (inone o f the most important headwater areas o f Central Asia);&#13;
&#13;
             Water resources management (sustainable and equitable water use);&#13;
             Watershed management (integrated and participatory);&#13;
&#13;
             Drought mitigation planning (preparedness and monitoring);&#13;
             Design o f irrigation systems, dams, hydropower and (road) bridge projects (water yield and&#13;
             variability, drought and flood frequencies) ;&#13;
             Optimization o freservoir operation (water availability, sedimentation, and flood forecasting);&#13;
             Groundwater table fluctuations (aquifer recharge and depletion);&#13;
&#13;
             Snow cover and glacier assessment (forecasting o f water availability and floods); and&#13;
             Monitoring o f trends caused by climate and land-use changes.&#13;
&#13;
Water resources assessmentand monitoring of climatic change. Adequate knowledge o f the available&#13;
water resources i s the basis (i)&#13;
                                for adequate planning o f development projects inthe water, agriculture and&#13;
power sectors; (ii)  for an equitable distribution o f the available resources to the potential users; and (iii)&#13;
for understanding and predicting the consequences o f water management decisions.               The historical&#13;
climatic (meteorological) and stream flow (hydrological) records are not necessarily representative for the&#13;
current hydro-meteorological conditions. The recent drought has made it clear that possible climatic&#13;
changes may seriously affect water resources availability, which therefore should be continuously&#13;
monitored. Surface water monitoring i s also essential for groundwater management as the base flow of&#13;
rivers represents the drainage o f aquifers inboth karstifiedrocks and porous media (alluvial aquifers).&#13;
&#13;
Water resources management, water abstraction and drought mitigation. The availability of data on&#13;
both surface water and groundwater resources will provide a basis for sound decisions in water&#13;
management, inparticular on water abstractions for irrigation purposes. Further development o f irrigated&#13;
land - extension o f irrigated areas and construction o f dams for water storage - will necessarily increase&#13;
overall water use. Even small-scale irrigation fi-om smaller tributaries and springs may reduce base flows&#13;
o f the larger streams and rivers, and eventually affect negatively water availability o f beneficiaries&#13;
downstream. Inthis context, water resources monitoring i s an important tool to ensure sustainability and&#13;
equity (upstream-downstream)        o f water distribution as well environmental protection. Drought&#13;
contingency planning will be facilitated by providing near-real time data on water resources depletion.&#13;
Early warning will be possible as soon as forecasting models have been developed based on collected and&#13;
analysed data.&#13;
&#13;
Irrigation scheme rehabilitation and construction. Irrigated agriculture i s crucial for agricultural&#13;
production in the country and, therefore, water management i s a highpriority for efficient water use and&#13;
the extension o f the irrigated areas. Data on stream flow and snow pack in Afghanistan allow for short-&#13;
term irrigation management, long-term irrigation planning, optimal reservoir operation and early warning&#13;
o f droughts and floods.&#13;
&#13;
Medium and large dam projects, flood and flow forecasting. There are several excellent locations for&#13;
medium to large dam construction projects in Afghanistan for irrigation purposes, flood retention,&#13;
hydropower generation and potable water storage. Irrespective o f the time horizon for the implementation&#13;
                                                       108&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
o f these projects, it is important to start data collection in time. The cost-benefit ratio o f data collection&#13;
and analysis for this type o f project i s excellent, as considerable investments are involved. Dam projects&#13;
always need data on water yield, expected water losses (evaporation and percolation), design floods and&#13;
sedimentation. When longer time series and/or hydrological models are available, inflow time series can&#13;
be simulated to optimise reservoir design and operation. Inflow forecasting i s an indispensable tool to&#13;
optimise reservoir operation. Drought risks can be identifiedat an early stage, while water use restrictions&#13;
are not necessary when the forecasting model predicts sufficientreserves.&#13;
&#13;
Hydropower development. Several suitable and economically feasible hydropower generation sites have&#13;
been identified in the country, including large dams, medium-size dams and micro-hydropower schemes.&#13;
The major perennial rivers have a good potential for medium-size run-of-river schemes, or for large&#13;
schemes in combination with the construction o f high dams, especially on the Kabul river and its main&#13;
tributaries such as the Kunar and Panjsher rivers in the hdus basin, but also on the Kokcha and Kunduz&#13;
rivers inthe Amu Darya basin, and on the Helmand river inthe Sistan (HelmandArghandab) basin. Mini&#13;
and micro hydropower schemes are an interesting altemative to diesel generation in remote mountain&#13;
areas, where a grid connection is not feasible. Data required for hydropower development are flow&#13;
duration curves (calculated from daily discharges o f several years) and flood frequencies o f different&#13;
recurrence intervals. A tele-transmission inflow forecasting system can also be used for hydropower&#13;
generation forecasting.&#13;
&#13;
Drinking Water Supply. A significant part o f the country's potable water supply comes from surface&#13;
waters, particular inrural areas, where there i s limited or no access to groundwater. The water quantities&#13;
used for drinking purposes are small compared to the total available discharge volume, but water quality&#13;
monitoring i s essential. Water quality i s generally good in the upper drainage basins, because large parts&#13;
o f Afghanistan are located at the headwaters, and in the past 25 years there has been very little use o f&#13;
chemicals in agnculture. The main issue i s turbidity o f the water (wash load), while there i s hardly any&#13;
saline surface water.&#13;
&#13;
 Small-scale irrigation scheme rehabilitationkonstruction, watershed management planning and&#13;
 small dam construction. For these activities, similar data as described above are needed, such as water&#13;
 yield and availability, water requirements (evapotranspiration) and flood frequencies .&#13;
&#13;
International Aspects. Wherever there is a water sharing agreement with neighboring countries, such as&#13;
with Iran in the case o f the Helmand river, monitoring o f outflows i s essential to ensure that the agreed&#13;
quantities o f water are released. It i s equally important to assess and monitor those trans-boundary rivers,&#13;
which are not yet subject to a bi-lateral agreement, such as, for example, the Kabul river and Amu Darya.&#13;
Whereas the Kabul river flow i s an important tributary o f the Indus river and hence its use i s crucial for&#13;
both Afghanistan and Pakistan, the share o f Amu Darya allocated provisionally to Afghanistan i s hardly&#13;
made use of.&#13;
&#13;
RehabilitationNeeds&#13;
&#13;
Though only a few hydrological stations have been visited by the Bank mission, MIWRE staff confirms,&#13;
that all stations are out o f order, and their water level recorders looted and staff gauges damaged or&#13;
removed. With a few exceptions, such as change o f river course or accumulation o f large amount o f&#13;
sediments, the existing gauging sites can be rehabilitated and used again inthe future. The reconstruction&#13;
of the historical gauging stations i s essential inorder to establish correlations with the available long-term&#13;
data series and new measurements reflectingpossible changes inflow volume and pattem.&#13;
&#13;
In a mountain area like Afghanistan, a relatively dense observation network o f hydro-meteorological&#13;
stations i s required in order to appraise the variability o f water resources. Precipitation and temperature&#13;
                                                       109&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
usually increases with elevation, but also depends on the exposure o f slopes (sheltered versus exposed&#13;
valleys). Stream flow varies according to the amount o f snow melt and the hydro-geological properties o f&#13;
river valleys. Wind velocity various greatly from region to region and sometimes increases evaporation&#13;
significantly, such as the 120 day wind (bad-e sad-o-bist ruz) in the Har-i Rud basin. Recommended&#13;
density o f stations measuring different hydro-meteorological parameters in Afghanistan i s reported in&#13;
Table 2. Calculation was done on the basis o f the total area o f Afghanistan o f 650,000 kmz,where 60%&#13;
or 390,000 kmzare mountains and the remaining 40% or 260,000 kmzare plains and other flat areas.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The above analysis shows that the existing number o f hydrological stations was not adequate given the&#13;
territory o f the country. This i s evident from the lack o f data, for example, in the Amu river basin.&#13;
Afghanistan currently does not know the contribution o f the Wakhan, Pamir and other rivers originating&#13;
in or flowing through Badakhshan to the Amu Basin. Given the emergency character o f producing&#13;
reliable hydro-meteorological data as soon a feasible, it i s intended to rehabilitate a total of 160 key&#13;
hydrological stations/posts, and to equip a total o f 30 meteorological stations with updated, modern&#13;
measurement technology. The number o f 160 includes a large part o f the historical 167 stations, but may&#13;
also new sites filling the gaps for planned reservoirs and irrigation schemes. The 30 meteorological&#13;
stations include six key stations ineach o f the five major river basins. It i s also intendedto re-establish the&#13;
four laboratories for sediment analysis and add a fifth one in Mazar-i Sharif or Maimana covering the&#13;
northward flowing river basin. Thus, sediment sampling and analysis are included inthe rehabilitation of&#13;
the hydro-meteorological observation network. Reliable stream flow data are a precondition for the&#13;
interpretation of sediment data. A data tele-transmission system i s needed for stations that are not&#13;
accessible throughout the year, such as snow stations, and for real-time flood forecasting. The latter i s&#13;
crucial for Afghanistan's rivers o f torrential character causing annual flood damages o f considerable&#13;
magnitude.&#13;
&#13;
Technology andEquipment&#13;
&#13;
Under the current conditions inAfghanistan, the equipment to be installed should be simple and reliable.&#13;
However, low-tech or mechanical technology does not automatically guarantee the acquisition o f more&#13;
reliable data. According to Hydrology Department staff o f the MIWRE, most o f the older technologies&#13;
were more sensitive to good maintenance and regular supply o f consumables than modem recording&#13;
systems with dataloggers. Digitizing o f strip charts i s tedious work and it i s a source o f errors, as i s&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
manual copying of observers' records. Manual gauge readings are insufficient especially in smaller&#13;
watersheds where times o f response are short. Traditional gauges with a float well cause considerable&#13;
construction cost and often suffer from sedimentation problems, just to cite a few examples. However, as&#13;
for the new technology using computers for data analysis, MIWRE staff must be trained to acquire&#13;
adequate skills in this field. It is, therefore, intended to chose a robust but not necessarily a simple&#13;
technology. A comparisono f simple and moderntechnologies i s providedinTable 3.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
4s the project will set standards for a national hydro-meteorological observation network in Afghanistan,&#13;
Gquipment and data analyses has to comply with international standards. To ensure optimum reliability o f&#13;
data collection, a double data acquisition system i s envisaged: (i) state-of-the-art automatic data collection&#13;
with data loggers; and (ii) manualreadingsby observers (who is required anyway for the safety and&#13;
                            daily&#13;
basic maintenance o f the station).      The manual readings will serve as backup if the recording system&#13;
failed. Care has     been taken to use few different technologies only, in order to reduce training&#13;
requirements, to simplify the management o f spare parts, and to make sure that instruments out o f&#13;
function can be replaced quickly. The following issues were considered when selecting the equipment for&#13;
the hydro-meteorological observation network:&#13;
&#13;
        0    Reliability and robustness,&#13;
&#13;
        0    Level o f maintenance requirements (maintenance-free as far as possible),&#13;
&#13;
        0    Duration of functioning without attendance,&#13;
&#13;
        0    Availability o f spare parts,&#13;
&#13;
        0    Autonomous energy supply,&#13;
&#13;
        0    Standardization (restriction to few types o f equipment and suppliers),&#13;
             Security (risk o f theft associated with the installation o f solar panels due to their commercial&#13;
             value), and&#13;
&#13;
             cost.&#13;
&#13;
Hydrological Stations&#13;
Each hydrological station will have a Staff Gauge mounted close to the section chosen for discharge&#13;
measurements. When procuring staff gauges, attention should be given to the quality ingeneral and to the&#13;
quality o f paidenamel, in particular. A total o f 40 staff gauges are required, their individual length&#13;
&#13;
                                                      111&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
dependingon the range o f water level fluctuation o f the respective gauging site. Depending on the geo-&#13;
morphological conditions o f the individual gauging sites, different water level recorders can be taken into&#13;
consideration, each one having its advantages and disadvantages, such as:&#13;
&#13;
         e   Float system (with strip-chart recorder or shaft encoder): Well-known system, analogue&#13;
             operation possible; highconstruction cost o f the gauging well, often sedimentation problems&#13;
             in gauging wells during floods, ice formation problems possible; if equipped with a strip-&#13;
             chart recorder: Time-consuming digitisation o f charts, regular supply o f charts and pens&#13;
             required, problems with both humidityand very dry air, time errors o f mechanical clocks.&#13;
&#13;
         e   Pressure transducer (submerged installation): Flexible installation, low cost, portable&#13;
             system, suitable for ephemeral streams; the data logger i s protected from heat in the water;&#13;
             low energy consumption, built-inbattery i s sufficient for many years of operation; relatively&#13;
             sensitive to humidity (condensation) and temperature fluctuations, reliable temperature&#13;
             compensation and long-term stability o f the sensor not always guaranteed; the probe i s&#13;
             inaccessible at high water levels if any problem (e.g. sediment accumulation or sensor&#13;
             problems) occurs.&#13;
&#13;
         e   Bubble-in principle: Only the low-cost pressure tube i s inside the water, length i s adjustable&#13;
             by the user, moving to other locations relatively easy; regular purging by air used for&#13;
             measurement, high-pressure purging i s easily possible by disconnecting the tube; long-term&#13;
             stability ensured by automatic zero-point correction; logistical problems of classical bubble-&#13;
             in gauges (supply o f gas bottles and energy supply) are solved by use of modern,&#13;
             maintenance-free mini compressors with low energy demand; limited range o f operation&#13;
             (max. water level 10 meters above orifice) except if a storage tank i s provided; care must be&#13;
             taken that the mouthpiece i s installed in such a way as to avoid pressure effects during&#13;
             currents.&#13;
&#13;
         e   Radar or ultrasonic water level measurement: No contact with water, no problems with&#13;
             sediments or debris accumulation, moving to other locations relatively easy; both types o f&#13;
             sensors need to be installed on a bridge or extension arm (jib) for vertical measurement,&#13;
             sensor i s not protected in a gauge house nor in the water; relatively new technology,&#13;
             relatively highcost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The bubble-in principle offers most advantages as a general system to be introducedinAfghanistan: Ease&#13;
and flexibility o f installation(no gauge well, no bridge or jib required for installation), long-term stability&#13;
of the sensors, accessibility and protected installation (outside o f the water) o f the instrument in a gauge&#13;
house, the possibility o f purgingthe system in order to remove sediments, and cost effectiveness are the&#13;
most important reasons for proposingthis system. Energy supply i s from a 12 V DC battery, either with a&#13;
solar panel or simply by recharging the battery approximately every 4 months. Ordinary car batteries can&#13;
be used when the original battery type i s not available.&#13;
&#13;
For temporay stations pressure transducers with integrated data loggers are recommended. No gauge&#13;
house i s required ifthe pressureprobe i s installedina protective tube with a lockedcap. A separate power&#13;
supply unit is not required as energy consumptionis low enough for long-term battery operation. Long-&#13;
term stability and accessibility are less important for this type o f temporary installations in seasonal&#13;
streams.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Cableways have to be installed wherever accurate measurements from a bridge are not possible. Inmany&#13;
cases, there are no suitable bridges for discharge measurements near the existing gauging sites: Ifa bridge&#13;
existed, often the cross-section under the bridge i s too irregular (narrow, turbulent flow, disturbed by rock&#13;
outcrops or piers Cableway spans are estimated to be between 50 meters and 200 meters. Specifications&#13;
&#13;
                                                       112&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
must include all parts except the posts on both sides. Cableway spans will be chosen to accommodate&#13;
approximately a 100-year flood. The tension o f the track cable must be adjustable to the precise span to&#13;
account for temperature variations. As temperature ranges are extreme in the country, a turnbuckle&#13;
tensioning system i s not suitable for long cableway spans. Tensioning by weights should be specified as&#13;
this system is flexible, self-adjusting, and relatively cheap (weights can be produced locally). Simple,&#13;
semi-mobile cableways can be used for temporary installations on smaller streams (cableway spans up to&#13;
45 meters). The posts together with the pulley blocks and cables would remain in place for the whole&#13;
measuring period, while the winch i s portable. The total cost o f such a mobile cableway system i s about&#13;
50% o f the cost o f a stationary cableway.&#13;
&#13;
Current meter equipment i s required in sufficient quantity for each o f the five regional centers. Intotal,&#13;
30 current meter sets for wading and suspended measurements, respectively are proposed to be procured.&#13;
Both types o f sets have to be compatible for two reasons, namely one, for flexible use o f the current&#13;
meters in the field (no need to carry two current meter sets if different types o f measurements will be&#13;
taken) and two, for exchangeability o f spare parts: Any current meter can be replaced when it i s damaged,&#13;
or out o f order for maintenance or calibration purposes. The heavy sinker weights o f up to 100kg can be&#13;
kept at the gauging site where they are used. Additionally, some 15 mini-current meters are intended to&#13;
be used for discharge measurements o f springs and irrigation canals, and three portable winches andjibs&#13;
for discharge measurements from bridges or from boats. For the later purpose, in areas where cableways&#13;
are not feasible to be installed, a total o f five boats, one per regional centre, will be procured.&#13;
&#13;
Manual data transfer by technical staff o f MNVRE (Field Assistant Hydrologists), at least during the&#13;
first three years o f network operation, will ensure reliable data acquisition. This does not cause additional&#13;
operations cost as regular visits to the gauging sites are required anyway (i)     for discharge measurements;&#13;
(ii) thecontroloftheoverallfunctionofthehydrologicalstation(sedimentationproblems, battery&#13;
     for&#13;
status); and (iii)for the payment o f the observers. The use o f notebook computers i s not feasible for this&#13;
task. Ordinary notebooks are sensitive to dust, humidity, shocks, bright sunlight (monitor visibility), and&#13;
therefore not suitable for day-to-day all-season use inthe field. Other problems are the long start-up time,&#13;
high energy consumption (short operating period), and weight. Robust field computers do exist but are&#13;
extremely expensive and heavy. It i s proposed to use dedicated field storage devices (interfaces) for data&#13;
read-out and transport to the office. These devices should be procured from the same supplier as the data&#13;
loggers (water levelrecorders) to ensure hardware and software compatibility.&#13;
&#13;
Tele-Transmission Equipment&#13;
&#13;
Because o f the remote locations and the innovative character o f any tele-transmission system, it i s&#13;
recommended to chose a well-established system, where all components have been tested to be&#13;
compatible and suitable for reliable long-term operation. The SNOTEL system using meteor burst&#13;
technology, operated in the Western United States since 1979, is such a system. In the USA, more than&#13;
700 snow stations are currently installed, and a similar system for flood warning and reservoir inflow&#13;
forecasting i s operated inPalustan. The meteor burst technology uses the ionised gas trail from sand-sized&#13;
meteor particles that bumup inthe atmosphere (height between 80 km and 120 km) to relay radio signals&#13;
back to earth. Radio signals are bounced o f f these gas trails and are reflected back to earth. The system&#13;
operates in the low VHF frequency band (40 to 50 MHz). The master station transmits a continuous&#13;
signal. When a meteor particle appears in the proper location, it reflects that signal to a receiving remote&#13;
station (probe signal), which inturnreflects a signal back along the same pathto the master station.&#13;
&#13;
The tele-transmission system proposed consists o f 30 snow stations, 20 meteorological stations, and 10&#13;
hydrological stations. The remote stations are connected to the data loggers o f either a snow station or a&#13;
meteorological station or a hydrological station. Maximum transmission distance is about 1600 km,&#13;
sufficient for any location in Afghanistan. Two sets o f antennas will be needed at the master station as&#13;
&#13;
                                                         113&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
each antenna covers a sector o f 60 degrees only. Apart from this restriction, the master station will be&#13;
capable o f communicating with any number o f remote stations. Additional remote stations within these&#13;
sectors can be added without any hardware modificationsrequiredto the master station.&#13;
&#13;
The remote stations will report not only measuring data but also status and maintenance data (battery&#13;
voltage, transmit power, antenna status, noise levels) to the master station on a periodic basis. The system&#13;
i s also capable o f sending text messagesbetween the master station and the remote stations and vice versa&#13;
(by-directional communication). Data transmission i s not continuous, but data transfer takes place in&#13;
frequently sent packages with an average transmission rate about 100 Bd.&#13;
&#13;
A remote stations needs a 6 mhighmast with a 40 W solar panel (approximately 60 x 120 cm) and a 3-&#13;
element yagi antenna. The master station, featuring antennas mounted on 16 m highmasts, i s installed in&#13;
a building with adequate ventilation and temperature control. It requires continuous 220 V A C power&#13;
supply. Data will be routedto the operator's office byradio ina line-of-sight mode.&#13;
&#13;
The installation costs o f a meteor burst system are relatively high (three times the amount o f a satellite&#13;
basedtransmission system), but there are no runningcosts for communication.&#13;
&#13;
Snow stations constitute, together with the tele-transmission system, the essential elements o f any flow&#13;
forecasting system. The basic equipment o f a snow station consists o f the following items: (i)       an air&#13;
temperaturehumidity sensor (essential for snowmelt rates); (ii)   a precipitation gauge for measurement o f&#13;
rainfall and the water equivalent o f snow; and (iii)   a snow pillow that records the total weight (the&#13;
accumulated water equivalent) o f the snow pack.          Other (meteorological) sensors may be added,&#13;
particularly where the precipitation gauging density i s low, and access difficult. The precipitation gauge&#13;
should either be equipped with tipping buckets and an antifreeze overflow system or with a pressure&#13;
transducer (storage type gauge). Precipitation gauges using the weighing principle are costly and&#13;
compensation o f wind impact i s not yet reliable enough for installation at remote locations. Trials with&#13;
weighing rain gauges should be made at well maintained stations, not at remote sites.&#13;
&#13;
Meteorological Stations. There i s little left from the historical agro-meteorological network. FA0 and&#13;
ICARDA have recently installed about a dozens o f automatic weather stations, which are also equipped&#13;
for rainfall recording. This i s a rather modest amount o f stations, and the project will support the&#13;
installation o f 30 meteorological stations capable o f measuring the most important climatic parameters&#13;
including rainfall intensity. A total o f 30 automatic weather stations, six for each major river basin, i s&#13;
considered to be a minimumfor the country. The automatic ("total") weather stations would include the&#13;
following equipment:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Power supply,&#13;
               Data logger,&#13;
               Hydrograph (relative humidity),&#13;
               Precipitation(with heater insome cases),&#13;
               Class A evaporation pan,&#13;
               Air temperature with solar radiation shield on mast,&#13;
               Earthtemperature at different depths,&#13;
               Anemometer (windspeed),&#13;
               Electronic cabinet, and a 10mmast.&#13;
&#13;
Rain Recorders.. From a hydrological point o f view, the most important shortcoming o f the past (and&#13;
present) system is, that none o f the existing types o f rain recorders i s capable to measure the water&#13;
equivalent o f snowfall correctly. Rain gauges usingthe weighing principle are capable o f measuring the&#13;
water equivalent (= weight) o f snow just as rain but this type o f rain gauges i s expensive and it has been&#13;
reported that untilvery recently wind effects have been causing measurement errors. Tipping-bucket rain&#13;
&#13;
                                                    114&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
gauges can be equipped with an overflow system filled with an antifreeze solution. It i s recommended to&#13;
wait for the experiences to be made with the rain recorders to be procured for the above-mentioned snow&#13;
stations, before additional rainrecorders are ordered.&#13;
&#13;
Rain Totalizer ("manual rain gauge". The network o f existing rain totalizers should be completed by&#13;
adding a certain number o f stations in mountain areas. Suitable locations are villages at higher altitudes&#13;
(above 2,000 m ad). It i s recommended to install rain totalizers at the observer's homes with clear&#13;
instructions on how to measure snowfall by tahng the rain gauge into the house or by adding a known&#13;
quantity o f hot water. It is proposed to procure rain gauges that are particularly suitable for measuring&#13;
snowfall, i.e. with a larger diameter (min. collecting area 500 cm*), and with sufficient depth (vertical&#13;
cylinder walls above the funnel) to accommodate snow. Rain totalizers should also be installed at each&#13;
hydrological station as there are no additional costs involved if the gauge observer takes the rainfall&#13;
readings as well.&#13;
&#13;
Software. Wherever data loggers are involved, i.e. at the hydrological stations (bubble-in principle and&#13;
compact pressure probes) and at the snow stations, specific software i s required for communication,&#13;
control, configuration and raw data management. Software for hydrological data processing, analysis and&#13;
database management has also to be procured taking into account the variety o f measurement devices&#13;
used for the hydro-meteorological observation network.&#13;
&#13;
Weather Radar and Upper Air Station. At this point, only one o f each weather radar and upper air&#13;
station i s planned.&#13;
&#13;
Laboratory for sediment analyses. A detailed list o f materials and equipment necessary to operate in an&#13;
efficient and effective manner the five laboratories will be preparedby MIWREstaff, inconsultation with&#13;
the international Hydrologist, before any procurement will be initiated.&#13;
&#13;
Network Sustainability&#13;
&#13;
Sustainability o f the network and long-term quality o f the data acquired will depend on the availability o f&#13;
funds and o f qualified and motivated personnel for operation. Most o fthe runningcost are not caused by&#13;
the engagement o f measuring instruments but by operational expenditures for transport (cars),&#13;
remuneration o f observers, decent salaries for qualified staff etc. Even the most basic network will fail if&#13;
these funds are not made available for a sufficient long period o f operation. Any network will cease to&#13;
operate, or produce very unreliable data as soon as, (i)      the qualified technical field staff i s no longer&#13;
available; (ii)observers are not paid regularly; and (iii)       the necessary logistics (car, international&#13;
procurement of spare parts) i s no longer available.&#13;
&#13;
TechnicalBackstopping.&#13;
&#13;
Technical problems with the hydrometric equipment should be addressed through support contracts with&#13;
the respective suppliers. Hotline I e-mail support should be provided and backstopping missions shouldbe&#13;
offered, if required. General technology transfer, usually free o f charge, can be obtained through the&#13;
HOMS (Hydrological Operational Multi-purpose System): Descriptions o f hydrological instruments,&#13;
technical manuals, computer programs and other materials are made available through HOMS by the&#13;
Hydrological Services o f member countries o f WMO. On the international level, WMO supports&#13;
operational hydrology and services while UNESCO (International Hydrological Program) rather&#13;
concentrates on research and educational activities. It i s recommended to try to integrate the hydrological&#13;
observation program inAfghanistan into a WMO program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    115&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
InstitutionalCooperationWith NeighboringCountries&#13;
&#13;
All the major river basins inAfghanistan are shared between Afghanistan and its neighbors. It is obvious&#13;
that exchange o f hydrological information and common resources management are desirable.                The&#13;
Hydrological Service o f Afghanistan will first have to be (re-)established as an institutional, legal entity&#13;
before we can think o f establishing cooperation structures. The hydrological parameters will be measured&#13;
individually in and by each country. As long as the measurement methods applied comply with&#13;
intemational standards, it i s not necessary to apply the same technologies or using the same equipment.&#13;
Standards will have to be set later on for data exchange and tele-transmission for forecasting purposes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Installation,OperationandMaintenance&#13;
&#13;
An operational hydrological service needs three categories o fpersonnel, namely professional hydrologists&#13;
(holding a university degree), hydrological technicians and observers. In the current situation in&#13;
Afghanistan number o f professional hydrologists are very limited, and this level o f training cannot be&#13;
achieved by short-term training measures. However, efforts should be made to train staff with university&#13;
degrees inrelated fields (irrigation, geology, meteorology, civil engineering) by short courses, workshops&#13;
and seminars to be held by intemational consultants. Tasks for hydrological technicians include: (i)     take&#13;
discharge measurements; (ii)     maintain stations; (iii)collect/download data; (iv) establish and update&#13;
rating curves; and (v) handle raw data. Observers are responsible for each station and for taking manual&#13;
(control) readings. In Afghanistan, this task has traditionally been done by the local teachers, who are&#13;
looking for supplemental income. Laboratory technicians are required to collect water samples from&#13;
various parts o f the river basins for physical analysis. Initial training on equipment and its operation and&#13;
maintenance should be organized in conjunction with the installation and commissioning o f the&#13;
equipment, and preferably provided by the supplier.&#13;
&#13;
InstitutionalArrangements&#13;
&#13;
Inaccordance to the Ministry's plan for river basin management, five regional offices are proposed. A&#13;
hydro-meteorological unit would be an integral part o f each regional office. It i s proposed that each&#13;
hydrological unit would include three hydrologist, six technicians, and each observation station would&#13;
have an observer. Given the distance and difficulty o f reaching some locations to be covered by the&#13;
technicians and the hydrologists in each river basin, the establishment o f a sub-unit i s considered, that i s&#13;
transferring some staff to province centers. The center in Kabul, in addition to being a regional center&#13;
would also be the national depository place for all hydrological databases in Afghanistan. Therefore, in&#13;
addition to the proposed staff under a regional center, it would also have an additional 4-5 personnel for&#13;
data management and analysis.&#13;

&#13;
         A partial and preliminary list o f projects selected by MIWRE for feasibility or pre-feasibility&#13;
studies i s discussed below (also see Table 1).          However, this list may change during project&#13;
implementation, as more information becomes available.&#13;
&#13;
Gatt IrrigationProject (Indus Basin): Located on the Logar river, a major tributary o f Kabul river, it&#13;
will (i)provide water for the irrigation o f about 10,000 ha in Kabul Province, (ii)recharge the&#13;
groundwater aquifers in and around the city o f Kabul, and (iii)  provide the necessary environmentalbase&#13;
flow for the city. The components o f the project include a small reservoir, diversion structures and a new&#13;
irrigation canal. An essential positive impact i s expected to be an improvement or at least stabilization o f&#13;
groundwater levels inand around Kabul City, where a population o f three million has to be supplied with&#13;
potable water.&#13;
&#13;
Kama Irrigation and Hydrpower Project (Indus Basin ): This project is located in Nangahar on&#13;
Kunar River, another major tributary of Kabul river. The purpose of the project is to provide reliable&#13;
water resources for irrigation o f 12,000 ha o f existing and new land (9,000 existing and 3,000 new)&#13;
situated on the left bank below the confluence o f Kunar and Kabul river inthe Nangahar Province. Project&#13;
components are a diversion dam, a lined conveyance canal feeding the existing traditional canals that&#13;
currently are experiencing difficulties with water extraction from the river, lateral canals, drainage&#13;
ditches, and a run-of-the-river hydropower plant with 45 MW capacity. The Kunar river, originating in&#13;
Pamir Mountains at over 7,000 maltitude, has one o f the highest and continuously available discharges in&#13;
the country. Nangahar i s the second most populatedprovince in the country, with large areas o f fertile&#13;
soils along the Kabul river, that produce three crops per year when adequately watered.&#13;

Chamkani Irrigation and Hydropower Project (Indus Basin): The project is located in&#13;
Chamkani District o f Paktia Province on river Chamkani, which flows Souteast towards the Indus river.&#13;
Its purpose i s to store water for flood protection purposes along the Chamkani river, provide a reliable&#13;
source o f water for irrigation purposes, and supply the Chamkani District with dnnlung water and&#13;
electricity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Olambagh Irrigation and Hydropower Project (Helmand Basin): This project is located in the&#13;
Urozgan Province on Helmand river. Water storage is to be provided for the purpose o f flood protection,&#13;
drought mitigation and sediment management o f the Helmandriver downstream o f the proposeddam site.&#13;
The proposed dam will regulate annual floods, provide electricity for the Southwest provinces of Nimroz&#13;
and Helmand, decrease sedimentation o f the Kalakai reservoir situated downstream o f the proposed dam&#13;
site thus increase the latter's life expectancy, and even mitigate negative drought impacts in the basin.&#13;
Beneficiaries include the population in the two southwestern provinces o f Helmand and Nimroz, totaling&#13;
1.185 million people.&#13;

Bakhshabad Irrigation and Hydropower Project (Har-i Rud Basin): A feasibility study of this&#13;
project was carriedout in 1976. The objectiveofthe projectthen was to stabilize the population inthe&#13;
region that was moving out. The purpose of the project was to build a dam on Farah Rud and to&#13;
provide irrigation water to 30,000 ha of existingfarmland. The plannedreservoirwas also intendedto&#13;
supply the entire populationof FarahProvince with drinking water. Additionally, ahydropowerplant&#13;
of 20 MW installedcapacity would have made electricity availablethroughout the Province. Inlight&#13;
of the current socio-economic and climatic conditions, the feasibility study shouldbe revisedandnew&#13;
justification for the projectprovided.&#13;
&#13;
Project on Northern flowing bind rivers (Northern Basin): Potential project has not yet been&#13;
selected. Reconnaissance studies by MIWRE are inprogress. At least one project will be selected for&#13;
preparingthe feasibility study, most probablyHash-dahNahr inBalkhprovince.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Kelagai Irrigation and Hydropower Project (Amu Darya Basin): This project is located on the&#13;
Kunduz river inthe Amu river basin in Baghlanprovince. Its purpose is to improve water supply for&#13;
56,000 ha of existingfertile irrigatedland that does not receive sufficient water during dry years, and&#13;
to develop an additionalarea of 25,000 ha of land situated alongthe Kunduz river downstreamof the&#13;
proposed dam, which was plannedto be constructed about 11kmupstreamof Pul-e-Khumri city. The&#13;
stored water would have ensured sufficient drinking water and electricity supply for almost all of&#13;
Baghlanandpart ofKunduzProvince.The proposedscheme includedthe followingworks: (i)              A dam&#13;
with a height of 80 m and a crest length of 665 m; (ii)    Spillways and a hydropower station, with an&#13;
installed capacity of up to 50 MW; (iii)A reservoir with a life storage of 800 million m3;(iv)&#13;
Headworkswith off-take regulator; and (v) Secondary structures and other subsidiarystructures. The&#13;
total cost of construction was estimated in the 1970s at US$ 45.4 million plus 2,069.8 million&#13;
Afghanis, however, without including costs related to the resettlement of people from the reservoir&#13;
zone and to the design and construction of irrigation systems for the 81,000 ha of land that would&#13;
receivenew or improvedirrigation water supply.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Irrigation Development and HydropowerProject on KokchaRiver( Amu Darya Basin): During&#13;
the 1970s, a dam locatedonthe border of Kunduz and Takhar Provinceon Kokchariver was planned&#13;
for the provision of irrigation water and for hydro-power generation, with the assistance from the&#13;
Soviet Union. The objectives of the planned project were as follows: (i)     irrigation of 12,120 ha of&#13;
new land situatedonthe right bankof the Rwer Kokcha; (ii)      improvementofwater supply to 7,740 ha&#13;
existing and irrigated land located inthe command area of the Nawabad(Zulm) canal; (iii)       securing&#13;
sufficient water supply throughout the growing period to the left-bank Nar-e-Archi Canal and&#13;
improvement of water supply to 25,400 ha of already irrigated land within the command area of this&#13;
canal; (iv) increase of potential for future irrigation of 5,300 ha of new land in the Nowabad massif&#13;
and about 12,000 ha of fallow land with irrigation canals but now unuseddue to the lack of water in&#13;
the Nari-ArchiCanal; and (v) generation of electricity with an installed capacity of 10-20 MW. A&#13;
preliminary cost estimate of the proposed multi-purposedamproject inthe early 197Os, excluding the&#13;
hydropower station, was US$33.43 million plus 2181.2 million Afghanis. Constructionworks begun&#13;
in 1980, and about 60% ofthe actual dam is completed. Eventually,the projectwas haltedduring the&#13;
late eighties with the collapse ofthe Soviet Union.&#13;

                            Monitoringand EvaluationFramework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Concept:&#13;
&#13;
        The monitoring and evaluation (M&amp; E) framework is designed to measure different aspects&#13;
of project performance during implementation. This i s essential to assess progress, exercise control&#13;
and identify likely implementationproblems. The monitoring and evaluation activities would provide&#13;
independentand continuous feedback to the implementingagencieson the project's performance and&#13;
the impact o f various project components on a regular basis so that corrective action could be&#13;
undertakenona timely manner.&#13;
&#13;
        The monitoring indicators could be physical, economic or financial. As an example, key&#13;
indicators would include project planning; programming and budgeting; performance of the&#13;
consultants and contractors; effectiveness of operations; delivery o f water, irrigation and drainage&#13;
services; and participation o f farmers and local communities. The M &amp; E framework consists o f (i)&#13;
inputmonitoring; (ii) monitoring; (iii)&#13;
                      output                  outcome monitoring; and (iv) impact evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
Input Monitoring:&#13;
&#13;
        Input monitoring will deal with monitoring critical inputs during project implementation, in&#13;
term of their appropriateness, quality, timeliness and cost. Examples include procurement of goods,&#13;
consultants and contractors.&#13;
&#13;
Output Monitoring:&#13;
&#13;
         Output monitoring will deal with monitoring the completion o f various project schemes, sub-&#13;
projects, training programs, studies and other project activities interms their appropriateness, quality,&#13;
timeliness and cost. Example include rehabilitation o f irrigation schemes, installation o f hydro-&#13;
meteorological stations and completion o f feasibility studies.&#13;
&#13;
OutcomeMonitoring:&#13;
&#13;
         The real impact and benefits o f a project to the ultimate beneficiaries depend not just on&#13;
project inputs and outputs but most importantly on the project outcomes. Outcome monitoring will&#13;
deal with monitoring project development objectives and key outcomes o f the project. Examples that&#13;
are specific to this project include (i)increase in area under assured irrigation (quantity); (ii)&#13;
improvement in timely delivery of irrigation water (quality); and (iii) reduction in water losses inthe&#13;
irrigation schemes (efficiency).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ImpactEvaluation:&#13;
&#13;
         Impact evaluation will deal with measuring the project impact on agricultural production and&#13;
farmers' income. The objective o f impact evaluation would be to measure the success o f project&#13;
                                                  127&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
implementation in terms o f project development objectives and to assess its physical, agricultural,&#13;
economic, environmental and social impact.&#13;
&#13;
         Example o f likely project impact evaluation studies are (i)&#13;
                                                                    changes in input use, crop yields,&#13;
cropping pattern and agricultural production; (ii)  impact on rural income and unemployment; (iii)&#13;
impact on surface and ground water supplies and quality; (iv) impact on water use and equity inwater&#13;
distribution; (v) performance o f irrigation schemes and community activities (such as Mirab and&#13;
Ashar); and (vi) overall benefits and economic impact o fthe project.&#13;
&#13;
Data Collectionand Analysis:&#13;
&#13;
         Inputs, output and outcome monitoring, and impact evaluation will require data collection and&#13;
data analysis on a regular basis. Baseline surveys need to be completed within six months o f the start&#13;
o f the project. Duringproject implementation, baseline survey data would be compared with the new&#13;
data to monitor, measure and evaluate the progress made towards achieving project development&#13;
objectives.&#13;
&#13;
Organizational Responsibility:&#13;
&#13;
         The implementation o f the M&amp; E framework will be the responsibility o f the M&amp; E Unit in&#13;
the Ministry o f Irrigation, Water Resources and Environment. M&amp;E Unit will not be part o f the&#13;
Program CoordinationUnit (PCU) but the M&amp;E staff will work closely with the PCU staff.&#13;
&#13;
StaffingNeeds:&#13;
&#13;
         Highquality and motivated staff, with specific skills, is essential to implement the M &amp; E&#13;
framework. The likely staffing needs are:&#13;
&#13;
         1. TeamLeader (International)&#13;

I.Introduction&#13;
&#13;
Background.&#13;
         Agriculture is the most dominant sector inthe Afghan economy. It accounts for over 50% of&#13;
GDP and most o f the exports. Over 75% of Afghans, who live in the rural areas, depend on&#13;
agriculture as their main source o f livelihood. Most o f them are below the poverty line. The main&#13;
issue facing the Afghans is how to transform the poorly performing subsistence agricultural sector&#13;
into a modern, dynamic and sustainable agriculture economy that provides food security, generates&#13;
farm income, reduces vulnerability andexpands livelihood opportunities. Lack o f assured and timely&#13;
water supply at the farm-level through the existing irrigation system appears to be one o f the most&#13;
critical constraints to food production, agricultural growth and rural development. This problem has&#13;
worsened inthe last 23 years of conflict, neglect, floods and drought. In2002, the actual area under&#13;
irrigation was only about 33% of the irrigation level in 1993 (the best available information).&#13;
&#13;
         Furthermore, the years of conflict, lack o f any meaningful maintenance and war damage has&#13;
contributed to deterioration o f irrigation infrastructure. As a result, the present dilapidated irrigation&#13;
system is working at only about 25% of its efficiency, the norm is about 40% - 60%. Important to&#13;
note that only about 10% o f the total irrigation infrastructure is formal andthe rest 90% i s traditional&#13;
system that was always maintained by the farmers and the farming communities. However, the&#13;
formal irrigation systemwas maintained by government as the farmers would not have the means to&#13;
maintain the sophisticated infrastructure.       In maintaining the system, the Afghanistan farmers&#13;
traditionally have a community system indistribution o f water that has been functioning well over the&#13;
centuries, and strengthening o f the system to include water management and other agriculture&#13;
advisory services wouldbenecessary.&#13;
&#13;
         In addition, at present, Afghanistan uses only about 30% of the total estimated water&#13;
resources (both surface and ground water) available inthe country. Almost 99% o f this water is used&#13;
for irrigation. In addition to watering the crops, the irrigation system is also a source o f dnnlung&#13;
water supply for humansand livestock inthe rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
         Among other problems to be faced is the lack of accurate and up-to-date hydrological&#13;
information (the latest information i s 25 years old) for proper planning, development and use o f&#13;
national water resources. In 1978, 167hydrological stations existed onmajor rivers o f Afghanistan, a&#13;
number that was not sufficient for accurate estimate of the water resources of the country. All of&#13;
these stations have since been damaged or destroyed. In addition, any initiative for sustainable&#13;
managementand use of water resources inthe country would require accurate measurementso f water&#13;
resources inthe system, without whch proper planningandmanagementwould not be possible.&#13;
&#13;
Project Objectives.&#13;
&#13;
           The overall objective of the project i s to provide farmers inthe project areas with improved,&#13;
reliable and equitable irrigation water deliveries to increaseagricultural productivity and farm income,&#13;
improve food security and livelihoods and reduce vulnerability to drought. The objective would be&#13;
achieved by (i)  rehabilitating and improving existing dilapidated irrigation infrastructure; (ii)&#13;
                                                                                                 restoring&#13;
and modernizing the hydro-meteorological network for better monitoring, planningand management&#13;
o f water resources, including contingency planning for drought and flood; and (iii)       developing the&#13;
capacity of public sector water institutions, enhancing role of community water organizations and&#13;
farmers for operating and maintaining irrigation system in a sustainable manner. This will reduce&#13;
&#13;

poverty in the rural areas and accelerate transition to sustainable agriculture and dynamic rural&#13;
economy inAfghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description&amp; Components.&#13;
&#13;
        The project would be covering rehabilitation o f small, medium and large schemes all over&#13;
Afghanistan, and would be implemented on an emergency basis over a period o f three years. The&#13;
project would also finance rehabilitation o f the hydrological observation network for the country as&#13;
the system has not been functioning over the past 25 years and no data on water resources o f the&#13;
country exist to plan and manage water resources. The project would also finance capacity building&#13;
of the entities involved inwater resources management. Project components are:&#13;
&#13;
        A.        Rehabilitationo f irrigation schemes&#13;
         B.       Rehabilitationo f the hydro-meteorological network&#13;
         C.       Preparationo ffeasibility studies and monitoring&#13;
         D.       Institutional development&#13;

&#13;
Descriptionof Assignment&#13;
&#13;
         The Mmistry o f Irrigation, Water Resources and Environment will engage a consulting firm or&#13;
an independent organization, following World Bank Guidelines, to carry out monitoring and evaluation&#13;
o f project impacts. The main objectives o f this exercise are to evaluate the success in meeting the&#13;
project objectives, and to assess its physical, agricultural, social, financial/fiscal, and economic impact.&#13;
The project impact evaluation would also provide independent and continuous feedback to the&#13;
implementing agencies on the project's performance and the impact o f its various components, so that,&#13;
corrective action or fine tuning could be undertaken in a timely manner. The M&amp; E reports would&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
         Agriculture is the most dominant sector in the Afghan economy. It accounts for over 50% o f&#13;
GDP and most of the exports. Close to 80% of Afghans, who live in the rural areas, depend on&#13;
agriculture as their main source o f livelihood. Most of them are below the poverty line. The main&#13;
issue facing the Afghans is how to transform the poorly performing subsistence agricultural sector&#13;
into a modern, dynamic and sustainable agriculture economy that provides food security, generates&#13;
farm income, reduces vulnerability and expands livelihood opportunities. Lack o f assuredand timely&#13;
water supply at the farm-level through the existing irrigation system appears to be one o f the most&#13;
critical constraints to food production, agricultural growth and rural development. This problem has&#13;
worsened inthe last 23 years of conflict, neglect, floods and drought.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         The years of conflict, lack of any meaningful maintenanceandwar damagehas contributed to&#13;
the deterioration o f irrigation infrastructure. As a result, the present irrigation system i s worlung at&#13;
only about 25% of its efficiency, the potential being 40% - 60%. About 10% o f the total irrigation&#13;
infrastructure is formal and the rest 90% is traditional that was always maintained by the farmers and&#13;
the farming communities. Strengthening of the community water management organizations is&#13;
essential for the sustainability o f irrigation system. However, the formal irrigation system was&#13;
maintained by the government since the farmers do not have the means to maintain sophisticated&#13;
irrigation infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         At present, Afghanistan uses only about 30% of the total estimated national water resources&#13;
(both surface and ground water) available in the country. Almost 99% o f this water is used for&#13;
irrigation. In addition to watering the crops, the irrigation system is also a source o f drinkingwater&#13;
supply for humans andlivestock inthe ruralareas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Among other problems to be faced i s the lack o f accurate and up-to-date hydrological&#13;
information (the latest information i s 25 years old) for proper planning, development and use o f&#13;
national water resources. In 1978, 167 hydrological stations existed on major rivers o fAfghanistan, a&#13;
numberthat at the time was not sufficient for accurateestimate of the water resourcesof the country.&#13;
Sustainablemanagementand use o f water resources inthe country requires accuratemeasurementsof&#13;
nationalwater resources.&#13;
&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
&#13;
         The overall development objective o f the project is to provide farmers in the project areas&#13;
with improved, reliable and equitable irrigation water deliveries to increase agricultural productivity&#13;
and farm income, improve food security and livelihoods and reduce vulnerability to drought. The&#13;
objective would be acheved by (i)         rehabilitating and improving existing dilapidated irrigation&#13;
infrastructure; (ii)restoringand modernizingthe hydro-meteorological network for better monitoring,&#13;
planning and management o f national water resources; and (iii)       developing the capacity o f public&#13;
                                                    134&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
sector water institutions, enhancing role o f community water organizations and f m e r s for operating&#13;
and maintaining irrigation system in a sustainable manner. This will reduce poverty inthe rural areas&#13;
and accelerate transition to sustainable agriculture and dynamic rural economy inAfghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
Project Components&#13;
&#13;
        To achieve the project development objectives, the project would include four components&#13;
and would be implemented on an emergency basis over a period o f three years:&#13;
&#13;
        A.     Rehabilitation o f irrigation schemes;&#13;
        B.     Rehabilitation o fthe hydro-meteorological network;&#13;

   expected to produce quarterly reports on the progress o f the project, including physical activities,&#13;
   procurement andfinancial management. These reports must follow the Bank formats.&#13;
&#13;
6. Additional Capacity to Implement the Irrigation Sector Program:                  FA0 has surveyed&#13;
   approximately 12,000 small, medium and large irrigation schemes all over the country. Many o f&#13;
   these schemes require varying degrees o f rehabilitation.         T h s initial information lays the&#13;
   foundation for the next step i.e. selection o f priority schemes for rehabilitation, comprehensive&#13;
   surveys, complete engineering designs and detailed analysis with respect to economic, social and&#13;
   environmental impacts as well as plans for strengthening community water organizations to&#13;
   ensure sustainability. This work would be handled, with full support from FAO, by the central&#13;
   office inKabul as well as by the regional offices located infive river basins o f Afghanistan. FA0&#13;
   must make sure that these central and regional offices are fully equipped and have the human&#13;
   resourcelinstitutional   capacity to carryout the expanding work program to rehabilitate the&#13;
   irrigation schemes all over the country. As the survey and design work expands, FA0 must also&#13;
   develop a system whereby private firms (local as well as international) are given the service&#13;
   contracts to carryout the survey/design/analytical work such that it does not become a constraint&#13;
   for expanding the actual rehabilitation program for the irrigation sector o fAfghanistan.&#13;

     Procurement,Contract Managementand Administration.&#13;
&#13;
     The Intemational Procurement Specialist will occupy an active position in MIWRE and will&#13;
     provide day to day advice and support to the PCU. It is recommended that the TA staff should&#13;
     retain independent consultant status, rather than having in-line positions within MIWRE. For&#13;
     example, they should not be delegated to stand in for the Project Coordinator in the latter's&#13;
     absence, ina way that would involve them in administrative matters or that might imply that they&#13;
     have authority to make commitments to other consultants or contractors on behalf o f the MIWRE.&#13;
&#13;
Use CurrentProcurementGuidelines, Monitor andVerify Procurementin all Sections.&#13;
&#13;
         The Consultant will monitor procurement in all sections and in all institutions to verify&#13;
compliance with current procurement guidelines, standards and procedures. Mistakes in following&#13;
such procedures and guidelines are a common cause o f delayed implementation o f projects. The&#13;
Consultant's main focus will be on-going monitoring so that procedural mistakes are avoided or,&#13;
failing that, to permit prompt corrective actionbefore any mistake causes overall schedule slippage.&#13;
&#13;
         The consultant will have to maintain liaison with the Government's central procurement&#13;
Consultant, which is presently Crown Agents at the AACA. The Consultant will also ensure that the&#13;
MIWREoffice has the current procurement guidelines ofthe WorldBank (WB).&#13;
&#13;
                                                      142&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2. Review, Check, and Monitor Procurement Circles and Establish Check List(s) of the&#13;
   Processand Timinginthe MinistryandInstitutions.&#13;
&#13;
   As described inSection below, the Consultant will set up a master schedule o fthe entire MIWRE&#13;
   Project Database. A summary version will be produced to show all the key milestones and main&#13;
   activities that must be accomplished for implementation o f all its components, highlightingthe&#13;
   activities that are the responsibility o f MIWRE. The master schedule will be accompanied by&#13;
   checklists for each major milestone indicating all sub-tasks required and approvals needed. The&#13;
   Consultant will monitor procurement against these checklists and schedule and will ensure the&#13;
   correctness and completeness o f all submissions to be made to the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
3. Prepare Monthly and Quarterly Progress Reports for the PCU, Including Comparison&#13;
   BetweenPlannedand Actual Progress inPhysicaland FinancialTerms and Identificationof&#13;
   Delaysand Recommendationsfor RemedialActions.&#13;
&#13;
   The Consultant will prepare the monthly and quarterly progress reports for the project in a format&#13;
  approved by MIWRE. This report will also be in conformance to the requirement o f the World&#13;
   Bankto recordprogress andevents, which have taken place onthe project. This will be one o fthe&#13;
   important management reports from MIWRE's viewpoint. The report will compare actual&#13;
  performance o fproject work, as measuredagainst the latest approved project plan.&#13;
&#13;
  The Consultant will also prepare a critical action report, if needed. This report will be an&#13;
   exception report to alert the concerned party o f decisions and corrective actions taken by the&#13;
   Consultant to control the project and present major actions and alternatives for approval. This tool&#13;
   will concentrate the attention o f and assists MIWRE on the decisions and choices w h c h must be&#13;
  made to keep the project on course.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   The monthly report will contain detailed schedule information, progress, problems, resolutions,&#13;
   compliance, deviations and status onthe project activities for the month.&#13;
&#13;
   Additional programs will be utilized by the Consultant to be able to do a fair comparison between&#13;
  planned and actual progress in physical and financial terms and identification o f delays and&#13;
   recommendations for remedial actions. Some o f these programs are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       a.   TrendProgram. The primary objective o f the trend program will be to track and control&#13;
            the agreed-upon project scope, quality, cost, and schedule. The trend program will also be&#13;
            used as the mechanism, which conveys an understanding o f the project evolution, as well&#13;
            as preventing cost and schedule surprises. Specifically, the trend program will allow&#13;
            MIWREto: optimize design; consider cost-saving alternatives; identify changes in the&#13;
            scope, improve quality, and services; take corrective actions before design deviations are&#13;
            irrevocably included inthe project.&#13;
&#13;
       b. Forecasting. A project forecast is a periodic reassessment o f a project's scope, cost, and&#13;
            schedule. Project forecasting is an integral part o f the PCS. The extent o f the forecasting&#13;
            effort is dependent on project size, complexity, and scope. The objectives o f a project&#13;
            forecast will be to: evaluate the current status o f project cost and schedule; determine the&#13;
            critical items for management review and action; identification o f delay and proposed&#13;
            remedial action recommended; andprovide a sound basis for future project control.&#13;
&#13;
4. Monitor Progress of Contracts Implementation to Ensure That it Abides by the Stipulated&#13;
   Standards,Proceduresand PlannedProcurementTimetable&#13;
&#13;
   The Consultant will monitor progress o f contract implementation to ensure that i t abides by the&#13;
   stipulated standards, procedures and planned procurement timetable. Furthermore, the Consultant&#13;
&#13;
                                                  143&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
will develop a set o f administrative procedures for the project which will assist MIWRE in&#13;
monitoring and addressing cost, schedule, technical design, and procurement timetable. The&#13;
Consultant's familiarity with basic procurement procedures of the Government o f Afghanistan,&#13;
familiaritywith the World Bank's project, and the procurement and disbursement procedures and&#13;
requirements o f the World Bank credit/loans will be the basis for the development o f these&#13;
procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Following a review and comparison of the various documents and reporting requirements, the&#13;
Consultant will propose a system o f procedures for review with MIWRE. Inworkshops with the&#13;
Ministry staff, and other stakeholders, the Consultant will establish the reporting and frequency&#13;
requirements, and work toward creating specific project level documents that contain the&#13;
necessary information for each agency (MIWRE, World Bank) that can be exported in the&#13;
individually desired formats.&#13;
&#13;
The key to this approach i s to build from the individual reporting processes and minimize&#13;
development o f new procedures, while integrating the information into a coherent overview at the&#13;
specific project level. Representative areas requiring monitoring procedures are summarized in&#13;
the following sections.&#13;
&#13;
    a. Project Schedule: The early development o f an integrated project procurement schedule&#13;
        is a key element that ensures good project implementation. Ths schedule needs to be&#13;
        developed to the greatest detail practical for the quality o f information used as input.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Critical information to be considered is the size o f contract packages, status o f work done&#13;
        at the initiation o f the contract, outstanding technical issues or commitments, and impacts&#13;
        o f potential variances. Other issues include the form, scope, and status o f the design&#13;
        contracts.&#13;
&#13;
        The Consultant will begin by working with the MIWRE team members and the staff from&#13;
        the MIWRE (design, and construction engineers) to identify information needed in order&#13;
        to establish a baseline procurement and project-specific schedule. Special considerations&#13;
        will be made for the uncertainties associated with various elements o fthe specific project,&#13;
        which will be assessedfor their potential schedule impacts. At all times, emphasis will be&#13;
        given to ensure conformance o f technical and contractual items with the already&#13;
        stipulated standards and procedures.&#13;
&#13;
        The Consultant will work with the MIWRE to assimilate the information and assist in&#13;
        creating a draft project master schedule, which will serve as a planning tool over the life&#13;
        o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
        The format o f the schedules will be tailored to the needs o f the MIWRE, usingPrimavera,&#13;
        Timberline andor MicrosoftTM project scheduling software, dependent on their needs.&#13;
&#13;
    b. Project Budget: Another key element o f the project control process is development and&#13;
        continual refinement and monitoring o f the project's budget. Using proven techniques,&#13;
        including the trend program, early identification o f scope changes, and regular cost&#13;
        forecasting, the Consultant will be able to assist MIWREto hold and monitor the various&#13;
        participants accountable and identify early-on potential budget variations. Recognizing&#13;
        these exposures early to provide time for effective solutions is a cornerstone o f control&#13;
        principles. Consultant will also assist MIWREinpreparation o f the reports inaccordance&#13;
        with the World Bank format for review.&#13;
&#13;
    c.  Technical Procedures:       From a technical procedures perspective, the Consultant will&#13;
        work together with the MIWREto monitor existing standards, specifications, procedures,&#13;
&#13;
                                                 144&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        and criteria or assist in creating project-specific documents as necessary. Special&#13;
        emphasis will be given to ensure that IDA's procurement standards and procedures were&#13;
        followed by all Sections and Institutions that benefit from IDA's credits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        While the interest inmaintaining the autonomy o f existing standards i s recognized, some&#13;
        project-level documents may need to be developed, depending on the final design and&#13;
        construction package division. The Consultant's approach is to review existing and&#13;
        required documents with the MIWRE to determine the most cost-effective means to&#13;
        develop project standards, specifications, and procedures while adhering to the IDA&#13;
        procurement guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
    d. Contract Management: The Consultant will be focused to ensure constant monitoring&#13;
        and smooth contract management and implementation. Cost and schedule control will be&#13;
        monitored by ensuring that the development o f optimum scope definition was achieved in&#13;
        all design and construction packages. Adherence to the stipulated standards and&#13;
        procedures and planned procurement timetable will be monitored through constant&#13;
        dialogue and communication with all concerned parties.&#13;
&#13;
5.  Preparation of Specific Procurement Documents, i.e. Tender Documents, Terms of&#13;
    Reference and Request for Proposals for New Projects as M a y Be Required b y the&#13;
    Ministry&#13;
&#13;
    If,and as, requested by the MIWRE,the Consultant will prepare intheir entirety, or assist&#13;
    with the preparation of, pre qualification documents and invitations for short listing, bid&#13;
    documents, terms o f reference and requests for proposals. Ifrequired the consultant will, as an&#13;
    additional service, make available back-up t e c h c a l staff to prepare terms o f reference for&#13;
    specialized services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    It is expected that tender documents for construction services, particularly technical&#13;
    specifications and bills o f quantities, will be prepared by the consultants engaged for design&#13;
    and or implementation services, and that the Consultant's role will be primarily inassisting in&#13;
    the review o f such documents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The specific procurement documents, i.e. tender documents, terms o f reference and request&#13;
    for proposals for new projects, are prepared to clearly define the scope o f work for each&#13;
    contract. The Consultant will prepare, or ensure that other responsible consultants produce,&#13;
    documents o f hgh quality, which will be consistent with international standards, donor's&#13;
    procurement guidelines andproject policies. Particular attention will be paid to ensure that the&#13;
    procurement documents for each contract clearly identify both work scope and schedule&#13;
    interfaces. Inaddition, the documents will be structured so that the combined scopes o f work&#13;
    for individualcontracts encompass the overall project, ifneeded. This is accomplished by in-&#13;
    depth review and approval cycles conducted by each department andor group within the&#13;
    MIWRE.&#13;
&#13;
    The Consultant will develop the commercial content o f the procurement documents for each&#13;
    contract package. The procurement documents will be based on project-developed master&#13;
    documents tailored to the unique requirements o f each contract. The project master&#13;
    procurement documents will include the procurement invitation, instructions, form o f&#13;
    proposal, form o f contract, general conditions, special conditions, and forms o f security.&#13;
    Tailored areas within the form o f proposal typically include design approach plan, detailing&#13;
    technical submittal for proposal data; workload data; key personnel resumes; and&#13;
    requirements for proposed work plans and schedules.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                145&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        The special conditions will be typically tailored to identify work schedules and milestone&#13;
        dates, warranty requirements, reporting requirements, interfaces with others, work rules,&#13;
        laydown areas,      insurance  conditions,    manufacturer's   representative   conditions,&#13;
        equipment performance guarantees, and specific liquidated damages. The price and&#13;
        payment section will be tailored in accordance with the donor's procurement guidelines&#13;
        and standards &amp; procedures, to detail the limits o f disbursement provisions for&#13;
        mobilization, demobilization, material and equipment deliveries, work progress and shop&#13;
        performance testing and commissioning. The procedure for withdrawal o f the proceeds&#13;
        o f the loan will be stipulated, including direct disbursements if permissible and&#13;
        authorized. Retention requirements and terms of reduction o f securities consistent with&#13;
        the technical requirements will be established. In addition to price, the procurement&#13;
        documents specify any factors to be taken into account in evaluating procurements, and&#13;
        determine how such factors will be quantified or otherwise evaluated. If procurements&#13;
        based on alternative designs, materials, completion schedules, financing and payment&#13;
        terms are permitted, conditions for their acceptability and the method o f their evaluation&#13;
        will be expressly stated and at all times will be in conformance to the donor's current&#13;
        procurement guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
6.      Participate in the Evaluation for Pre-qualification of the Contractors, Expression of&#13;
        Interest for Short Listing, Tenders and Proposal and in Preparingthe Corresponding&#13;
        Report&#13;
&#13;
        As requested by MIWRE,the Consultant willparticipate as an evaluation committee member&#13;
        or in an oversight role in the evaluation o f contractors' pre-qualification submissions,&#13;
        consultants' expressions of interest inbeing short-listed, proposals and tenders.&#13;
&#13;
7.      PrepareProcurementPlanfor the Project inorder to expediteproject implementation&#13;
&#13;

            Afghanistan - Emergency Irrigation
            Rehabilitation Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Emergency Irrigation Rehabilitation
            Project will provide farmers with improved, reliable and
            equitable distribution of irrigation water, to increase
            agricultural productivity and farm income, improve food
            security and livelihoods, and, reduce vulnerability due to
            droughts. The project supports rehabilitation of irrigation
            schemes, rehabilitation of national hydro-meteorological
            network, preparation of feasibility studies and monitoring,
            and institutional development. Returns to investment in
            irrigation and water resources are expected to be large, in
            terms of both economic benefits, and institutional
            development. Likely risks are weak institutional capacity;
            fragile security situation; prevalence of land mines;
            misallocation, misuse or inefficient use of funds; and,
            riparian issues. Appropriate mitigation measures have been
            proposed to address these risks.
