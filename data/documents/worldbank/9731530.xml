    The Government of Japan has been supporting capacity development through the World Bank for 17&#13;
    years. It has provided grants under its Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) Fund to&#13;
    support graduate scholarships, training activities, and preparation and implementation of loans and&#13;
    credits. Various evaluations have shown all three types of assistance to be effective, and grants to sup-&#13;
    port project preparation in particular have generally been judged highly successful, because they have&#13;
    contributed to rapid and high-quality preparation of lending operations. A recent independent evalua-&#13;
    tion has shown that these grants have also contributed substantially to human capacity development in&#13;
    recipient countries, because recipient execution has led to strong ownership, the nature of project prepa-&#13;
    ration has put a premium on capacity development needs, and the design of the program has favored&#13;
    capacity development activities.&#13;

   路 Improved organizational systems, such as financial management and procurement systems, project design, planning and&#13;

   路 Implementing more decentralized management systems that are more efficient and participatory, allocate tasks more appropri-&#13;
      ately along the national-local spectrum, and work with civil society&#13;
   路 Better coordination and information sharing among different agencies, such as interministerial discussions to agree on priori-&#13;

   at the operational environment Level&#13;
   路 Increasing awareness at the policy level of the value of stakeholder participation for better project outcomes&#13;
   路 Disseminating knowledge beyond the original group of local consultants trained through sharing of the training through local&#13;
      organizations&#13;
   路 Building the capacity of the domestic consulting industry&#13;
   路 Leveraging best practice in national contexts: The World Bank's requirements helped some implementing agencies to press&#13;
      national authorities for higher standards and good practice in project management and procurement systems, and so on.&#13;

            Learning by doing : the Japanese PHRD fund
            and capacity development
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Government of Japan has been
            supporting capacity development through the World Bank for
            17 years. It has provided grants under its Policy and Human
            Resources Development (PHRD) Fund to support graduate
            scholarships, training activities, and preparation and
            implementation of loans and credits. Various evaluations
            have shown all three types of assistance to be effective,
            and grants to support project preparation in particular have
            generally been judged highly successful, because they have
            contributed to rapid and high-quality preparation of lending
            operations. A recent independent evaluation has shown that
            these grants have also contributed substantially to human
            capacity development in recipient countries, because
            recipient execution has led to strong ownership, the nature
            of project preparation has put a premium on capacity
            development needs, and the design of the program has favored
            capacity development activities.
