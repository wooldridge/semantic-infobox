&#13;
                                    Standard Provisions&#13;
&#13;
This Annex will be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Agreements&#13;
between the Bank and the respective Donors.&#13;
&#13;
1.     Administration of the Contributions&#13;
&#13;
1.1     The Bank will be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set&#13;
forth in this Administration Agreement and will not be subject to any other duties or&#13;
responsibilities to the Donors, including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that&#13;
might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee under general principles of trust or fiduciary&#13;
law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement will be considered a waiver of any&#13;
privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any applicable law,&#13;
all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
&#13;
1.2      Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") will be administered&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be&#13;
amended from time to time, including its procurement, financial management, disbursement&#13;
and safeguard policies, its framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its&#13;
screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in&#13;
line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the Security&#13;
Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United Nations. The Donors&#13;
acknowledge that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under the anti-&#13;
terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an&#13;
individual member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;
&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be accounted for as a single trust fund&#13;
and will be kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the&#13;
Trust Fund may be commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The&#13;
Bank, in its capacity as trustee, has legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
&#13;
2.2     The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund will be held is United States&#13;
Dollars (the "Holding Currency").&#13;
&#13;

their respective Administration Agreements.       In the case of deposits received in a&#13;
Contribution Currency other than the Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such&#13;
amounts and the accompanying Deposit Instructions, the Bank will convert such amounts&#13;
into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the&#13;
conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a result of&#13;
exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor will bear any responsibility for&#13;
providing any additional financing.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           -7-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into&#13;
other currencies as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the&#13;
Bank on the date of the conversion.&#13;
&#13;
2.5     The Bank will invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending&#13;
their disbursement in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the&#13;
investment of trust funds administered by the Bank. The Bank will credit all income from&#13;
such investment to the Trust Fund to be used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
&#13;
3.     Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
&#13;
3.1     The Bank will deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each&#13;
Installment, an amount equal to two percent (2%) per Installment as an administrative fee&#13;
for the Trust Fund.&#13;
&#13;
3.2     In addition, costs incurred by the Bank for other expenses, such as for program&#13;
management and Trust Fund administration, that are: (i) not covered by the percentage&#13;
deduction specified above as an administrative fee; and (ii) not included under Annex 1 of&#13;
the Administration Agreements in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and&#13;
procedures will be charged to the Trust Fund on an actual basis up to a maximum of ten&#13;
percent (10%) of the total Contributions under all Administration Agreements.&#13;
&#13;
3.2 3 Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this&#13;
Trust Fund Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions.&#13;
If actual Contributions significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time&#13;
of signature of the first Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust&#13;
Fund fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right to request a change to the terms of&#13;
this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by amendments made to&#13;
the Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable to&#13;
all new Contributions that are provided either as amendments to supplement existing&#13;
Administration Agreements or from new Donors under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
&#13;
4.     Accounting and Financial Reporting&#13;

receipts, disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the&#13;
Contributions via the World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website. Within six&#13;
(6) months after all commitments and liabilities under the Trust Fund have been satisfied&#13;
and the Trust Fund has been closed, the final financial information relating to receipts,&#13;
disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions&#13;
will be made available to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure&#13;
website.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;

single audit report, comprising: (i) a management assertion together with an attestation from&#13;
the Bank's external auditors concerning the adequacy of internal control over cash-based&#13;
financial reporting for all cash-based trust funds as a whole; and (ii) a combined financial&#13;
statement for all cash-based trust funds together with the Bank's external auditor's opinion&#13;
thereon. The cost of the single audit will be borne by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
4.4     If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by&#13;
the Bank's   external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank will first consult as&#13;
to whether such an external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor will agree on the&#13;
appropriate scope and terms of reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope&#13;
and terms of reference, the Bank will arrange for such external audit. The costs of any such&#13;
audit, including the internal costs of the Bank with respect to such audit, will be borne by&#13;
the requesting Donor.&#13;
&#13;
4.5     The Bank will make available to the Donors copies of all financial statements and&#13;
auditors' reports received by the Bank from Recipients pursuant to any Grant Agreements&#13;
(as defined below) in accordance with the Bank's Access to Information Policy.&#13;
&#13;

by the Trust Fund.&#13;
&#13;
5.2     Any Donor may review or evaluate activities financed by the Trust Fund at any time&#13;
up to six (6) months following the End Disbursement Date. The Donor and the Bank will&#13;
agree on the scope and conduct of such review or evaluation, and the Bank will provide all&#13;
relevant information within the limits of the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All&#13;
associated costs, including any costs incurred by the Bank, will be borne by the Donor. It is&#13;
understood that any such review or evaluation will not constitute a financial, compliance or&#13;
other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;
&#13;
6.      Disbursement; Cancellation; Refund&#13;
&#13;
6.1     It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by&#13;
the Bank by December 31, 2019 (the "End Disbursement Date"). The Bank will only&#13;
disburse funds deposited in the Trust Fund for the purposes of this Administration&#13;
Agreement (other than returns to Donors) after such date to the extent such date is changed&#13;
in accordance with amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all the Donors.&#13;
Following the End Disbursement Date, the Bank will return any remaining balance of the&#13;
Trust Fund to each Donor in the Holding Currency in the manner specified in its respective&#13;
Administration Agreement on a pro rata basis with regard to the total funds deposited in the&#13;

entered into between the Bank and any consultants and/or other third parties for the&#13;
purposes of this Administration Agreement, including any Grant Agreements, prior to the&#13;
receipt of such notice. In the event of a cancellation, the Bank will return to the relevant&#13;
Donor or Donors in the Holding Currency in the manner specified by each such Donor in its&#13;
respective Administration Agreement the pro rata share(s) of any such uncommitted balance&#13;
of the Trust Fund, in accordance with any additional terms that may be agreed between the&#13;
Bank and each such Donor.&#13;
&#13;
7.     Disclosure; Dispute Resolution&#13;

this Trust Fund in accordance with the Bank's Policy on Access to Information. By entering&#13;
into Administration Agreements, the Donors consent to such disclosure of their respective&#13;
Administration Agreements and such related information.&#13;
&#13;
7.2    The Donors and the Bank will use their best efforts to amicably settle any dispute,&#13;
controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to the Administration Agreements.&#13;
&#13;
8.      Grants to Recipients&#13;
&#13;
8.1     In accordance with the governance structure provided in Annex III of this&#13;
Administration Agreement, the Bank will, as administrator of the Trust Fund on behalf of&#13;
the Donors, enter into one or more grant agreements (the "Grant Agreements") with&#13;
recipients (the "Recipients") consistent with the purposes of this Administration Agreement&#13;
and on the terms and conditions set forth in the Grant Agreements. Grant Agreements may&#13;
be entered into up to the maximum amount of the Contributions that all Donors have agreed&#13;
to make available under the Administration Agreements between the Bank and the Donors.&#13;
&#13;
8.2    The Bank will be responsible for the supervision of the activities financed under any&#13;
Grant Agreements. Subject to the consent of any relevant Recipients, representatives of the&#13;
Donors may be invited by the Bank to participate in Bank supervision missions related to&#13;
the Trust Fund.&#13;
&#13;
8.3     The Bank will promptly inform the Donors of any significant modification to the&#13;
terms of any Grant Agreements and of any contractual remedies that are exercised by the&#13;
Bank under any Grant Agreements. To the extent practicable, the Bank will afford the&#13;
Donors the opportunity to exchange views before effecting any such modification or&#13;
exercising any such remedy.&#13;

                                                                                   ANNEX 3&#13;
&#13;
                                        Governance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This Annex will be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Agreements&#13;
between the Bank and the respective Donors.&#13;
&#13;
A two-tier governance structure is proposed for the Zimbabwe Reconstruction Fund: (a) a&#13;
policy oversight committee responsible for policy oversight, resource mobilization, and&#13;
project/grant approvals; and (b) technical working groups responsible for technical and&#13;
eligibility screening of project/grants. The two structures will be supported by a secretariat&#13;
based in Harare and project support teams. The effectiveness of the governance structure&#13;
would be assessed after 6-12 months of Trust Fund operation. In its role as ZIMREF&#13;
administrator, the Bank would be responsible for, among others: overall management of the&#13;
Trust Fund; technical oversight and quality control for Trust Fund funded projects in&#13;
accordance with Bank policies and procedures; and establishment and management of the&#13;
secretariat.&#13;
