REPUBLIC OF YEMEN&#13;
TAIZ WATER SUPPLY PILOT PROJECT&#13;
Credit and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:           The Republic of Yemen&#13;
Implementing        The National Water and Sanitation Authority (NWSA)&#13;
Agencies:           The National Water Resources Authority (NWRA)&#13;
Southern Uplands Rural Development Unit (SURDU)&#13;
Beneficiaries:      The population of the City of Taiz and surrounding communities&#13;
Amount:             SDR 7.1 million (US$10.2 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:              Standard with 40-year maturity and 10 years' grace&#13;
Commitment&#13;
Charge:             Standard (a variable rate between 0 and 0.5 percent of the undisbursed credit&#13;
balance set annually by the Executive Directors of IDA).&#13;
Project&#13;
Objectives:         The Project's main objectives are to mitigate the immediate water shortage in the&#13;
city of Taiz (by increasing supply by about 100 percent) and identify new water&#13;
sources to avert a sustained water shortage (to meet the needs of at least the year&#13;
2000 or about 550 liters per second). The Project also aims at developing and&#13;
testing an institutional framework for decentralized water resources management&#13;
through participation of local communities (through the establishment of&#13;
comnmunity associations), and to promote private sector participation in the&#13;
management of water and wastewater utility services (by entering into a&#13;
management contract in the second phase of the Taiz Water Supply Project).&#13;
Project&#13;
Description:        The Project consists of three components: (i) well drilling and conveyance to the&#13;
city of Taiz; (ii) a compensation package for people in the Habir area who will&#13;
give up water for Taiz, consisting of rural water supply schemes that include a&#13;
pilot program of activities targeted at women; two demonstration irrigation&#13;
schemes including wells, piping and technical assistance; school rooms; and&#13;
studies for an aquifer recharge dike in Habir area; and (iii) studies of surface and&#13;
ground water sources for urban and rural development; technical assistance for&#13;
the preparation of a second phase project for the city of Taiz and Al Qaidah&#13;
town; and preparation of a management contract for Taiz NWSA branch for&#13;
implementation in the second phase project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
Benefits and Risks:   Project benefits include: (i) mitigation of water scarcity in the City of Taiz to&#13;
reduce a potential health crisis due to unsanitary conditions; (ii) reduction of&#13;
stress on existing aquifers; (iii) provision of water to low income families (about&#13;
25 percent of Taiz population) that cannot afford the high price set by private&#13;
water vendors; (iv) development of a framework for participation of rural&#13;
communities in the management of water resources; (v) formulation of a&#13;
compensation mechanism to rural communities to enable water transfers to urban&#13;
areas under the principles of integrated water management; and (vi) development&#13;
of a regional water management plan to prevent uncontrolled development of the&#13;
Hadramawt area. There are three main project risks. First, although the rural&#13;
communities in Habir area have agreed to the transfer of water to Taiz and to a&#13;
compensation package, they may later request to modify the accord in such a way&#13;
to make it unworkable. To reduce this risk, the Government and IDA have spent&#13;
considerable resources making sure that the agreed arrangement is both&#13;
reasonable and sustainable. The second risk is that water extraction will exceed&#13;
the agreed sustainable yield of the effected aquifers. To reduce this risk, safe&#13;
yields of the aquifers have been established and pumps sized accordingly. Also,&#13;
actual abstractions will be monitored with facilities provided by the project, and&#13;
monitoring activities will be sanctioned on a regular basis by the stakeholders.&#13;
The third risk is that the Government may be unable to put in place the&#13;
management contract in Taiz, thus undermining the sustainability of the project.&#13;
The pilot nature of the project has been chosen to address this risk by ensuring&#13;
that an effective institutional framework is implemented in Phase II of the&#13;
strategy.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN&#13;
TAIZ WATER SUPPLY PILOT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.1        Unification of North and South Yemen in 1990, the Gulf crisis in 1991 and the civil war in&#13;
1994 have resulted in massive population dislocations which have primarily affected major urban centers,&#13;
such as Sana'a and Taiz. One significant impact has been the increased demand for urban infrastructure,&#13;
particularly drinking water supply. The political crisis also resulted in institutional uncertainties,&#13;
weakening the National Water and Sanitation Authority (NWSA) and reducing public investments to such&#13;
low levels that the quality of public water supply and waste water services fell below minimum acceptable&#13;
standards.&#13;
1.2        Yemen is quickly heading for a water crisis and is considered the most water-stressed&#13;
country in the Middle East. The country is poorly endowed with fresh water resources and its growing&#13;
shortage is threatening to undermine the country's economic growth prospects.  The country has no&#13;
perennial rivers and, therefore, must rely on periodic rainfall and groundwater for all its potable water&#13;
and irrigation needs. National fresh groundwater storage is estimated at about 10,370 billion cubic&#13;
meters, with an annual recharge of about 1.5 billion cubic meters. However, annual withdrawals in 1994&#13;
were estimated at about 2.1 billion cubic meters, or about 140 percent of the safe yield. In certain parts&#13;
of the highlands the situation is much worse; for example, in the Sana'a basin annual mining of the&#13;
aquifer is currently about 300 percent of the sustainable yield.&#13;
1.3        The City of Taiz, located in the highlands approximately mid-way between Sana'a and Aden,&#13;
is Yemen's third largest city with a population of about 400,000. Water shortages in Taiz have increased&#13;
to the extent that piped water supply is available only once every 40 days. Private water vendors have&#13;
emerged to meet the demand, but only middle and upper income families can afford to pay the high&#13;
purchase price (up to YR 700 or about US$5.40 per cubic meter). Taiz's population is expected to reach&#13;
about 475,000 by the year 2000 and 670,000 by 2010. Water demand, based on a moderate per capita&#13;
daily demand of 100 liters, is estimated to increase from about 460 liters per second (Ips) today to about&#13;
550 lps in the year 2000, and then 775 lps in 2010. These numbers show that the present water shortage&#13;
crisis would worsen in the near future. In contrast, the main sources of water supply, Al Haima and&#13;
Houban/Hougela well fields, are being depleted to the extent of approaching total collapse. Since early&#13;
1994, the yield of Al Haima well field has declined by about fifty percent to about 75 lps today; and the&#13;
Houban and Hougela well field has apparently stabilized at about 40 lps, a 50 percent drop in the last four&#13;
years.  NWSA's performance has also deteriorated as evidenced by the high degree of inefficiency&#13;
(unaccounted-for water exceeds 50 percent of water production) and insufficient generation of financial&#13;
resources.&#13;
1.4        The only proven water source with a potential for transferring water to Taiz is located about&#13;
30 kilometers north of the city in the Habir area of the Ibb governorate. Since June 1995, NWSA has&#13;
drilled five exploratory wells and two or three more will be drilled which would yield up to 140 lps for&#13;
transfer to Taiz. This additional amount of water will reduce the current shortage in the city by about&#13;
half, making water available to individual customers once in every 20 days.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                                 Taiz Water Supply Pilot Project&#13;
1.5        A water strategy is being developed by the Government of Yemen (GOY) with donor and&#13;
International Development Association (IDA) assistance that confronts the serious crisis of water resource&#13;
depletion and the problems of water supply management. The strategy calls for decentralization of&#13;
decision making, compensation of rural communities for loss of productive water, restructuring NWSA,&#13;
and a role for the private sector in urban service delivery.&#13;
Sectoral Developments&#13;
1.6        The Government has only recently been able to turn its attention to resolving the country's&#13;
impending water crisis and is already taking measures to: (i) reform water sector institutions; (ii)&#13;
formulate and implement an integrated water sector strategy; and (iii) foster an increased role for the&#13;
private sector in water resources management. On the institutional side, in October 1995, GOY created&#13;
the National Water Resources Authority (NWRA) to assume full responsibility for water resource&#13;
management. NWRA's chairman was appointed in April 1996 and the agency is now in the process of&#13;
organizing and staffing. Ultimately, NWRA will be responsible for water resources planning and&#13;
monitoring at the national level, the drafting of water-related legislation, the licensing of water uses and&#13;
well-drilling equipment, and increasing public awareness on water resource issues. The Government also&#13;
recently established a Technical Secretariat to reform NWSA, which is the government agency responsible&#13;
for the provision of water and waste water services in urban areas in the country, and to identify methods&#13;
for increasing the efficiency of sector utilities.&#13;
1.7        On the strategy side, the Government, with assistance from IDA and other donors, is&#13;
developing an integrated water resource management strategy to confront the crisis of water resource&#13;
depletion. Recognizing the difficulty of effectively implementing commnand-and-control measures in the&#13;
countryside, the Government aims to decentralize decision making and secure end-user involvement in&#13;
water use decisions. The Government and its donor partners (including IDA) have already spent&#13;
considerable time working in Habir area as part of the formulation of the integrated water resources&#13;
management strategy. The results in this community will give an indication of the applicability of this&#13;
approach to other parts of the country and help to validate the decentralized approach to sustainable water&#13;
use.&#13;
1.8        Increasing the role of the private sector is a key element of the Government's water strategy.&#13;
All indications are that NWSA will not be able to reform itself quickly enough to meet the growing urban&#13;
demand for water and avoid the impending crisis that a severe water shortage would bring. Already,&#13;
NWSA is unable to supply all customers in several large cities of the country's uplands, and private water&#13;
supply systems (including small piped systems) have sprung up in order to meet the demand. There&#13;
would, therefore, appear to be an opportunity for private operators to assume management of the existing&#13;
infrastructure in selected cities in order to both improve the quality of service and efficiency of operations&#13;
to lower the overall cost of water to consumers. The Government is actively pursuing this avenue and&#13;
has requested that the design of a management contract be included in the Project for implementation&#13;
under a follow-up project.&#13;
Strategy to Alleviate the Taiz Water Crisis&#13;
1.9        The strategy agreed with the Government to alleviate Taiz's water crisis (paras. 1.3-1.4)&#13;
would be a model that, if successful, would be transferred to other parts of the country. The strategy&#13;
has four elements: (i) rehabilitating and upgrading the water supply and distribution network to reduce&#13;
system losses; (ii) developing new water sources to meet future demand; (iii) involving the private sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Taiz Water Supply Pilot Project                                                           3&#13;
under a management contract to improve management; and (iv) ensuring financial viability of the services&#13;
through a combination of adequate tariffs and improved commercial operations. To carry out this&#13;
strategy, a two-phase approach is proposed.&#13;
1.10       During Phase I, the Pilot Project would be implemented to test a framework for participation&#13;
of rural communities in water allocation, explore the Taiz area for new water sources and promote&#13;
involvement of the private sector via a management contract for urban water and wastewater service&#13;
delivery. If successful, Phase I would be followed by Phase II, during which a proposed Taiz Water&#13;
Supply and Sanitation Project would implement major water supply and distribution improvements in Taiz&#13;
and develop additional supply sources identified in the first phase. During negotiations, ireement wa,&#13;
reached with the Government on the strategy to alleviate the Taiz water crisis as recorded in the Policy&#13;
Sector Letter of the Government.&#13;
Lessons from Previous IDA Involvement&#13;
1.11       IDA has extensive experience in urban water sector projects in Yemen; eight projects are&#13;
completed and another two projects are under implementation. They both h.ave satisfactory ratings for&#13;
development objectives and implementation progress. This experience has been primarily in the provision&#13;
of water supply and waste water collection systems and institutional strengthening of NWSA. The&#13;
experience indicates that the impediments to sectoral development continue to be the lack of Government&#13;
commitment to provide autonomy to water institutions, inability of the Government to secure consent of&#13;
local communities to develop and allocate water resources, and the absence of a water resources strategy.&#13;
In brief, this experience shows that the future success of water utilities depends on the Government's&#13;
willingness to develop a comprehensive, up-to-date and appropriate policy for the sector, and on its ability&#13;
to provide incentives for the participation of local communities and for the improvement of urban&#13;
services. Particularly important in this regard is the establishment of an institutional framework that can&#13;
further the sustainability of both individual projects and overall water resources management. This&#13;
Project directly addresses these issues through the preparation of an urban water sector policy statement,&#13;
the provision of a framework for private sector management of urban service delivery and the&#13;
implementation of institutional reforms.&#13;
Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
1.12        The Project's objectives are fully consistent with the country assistance strategy for Yemen&#13;
(as discussed by the Executive Directors on February 20, 1996) that recognizes the key role that sound&#13;
management of the country's scarce natural resources, especially water, has in establishing a foundation&#13;
for sustainable economic growth. The Government has requested IDA and other donors to assist in&#13;
formulating a long-term and sustainable water management strategy. The long involvement of IDA in&#13;
the sector gives a comparative advantage to introduce major reforms in the water sector. Under this&#13;
Project, IDA is taking a lead role to test sector reforms to complement the ongoing works of other&#13;
donors. In this context, IDA participation in the proposed pilot project is an important step in the&#13;
formulation of a water strategy for Taiz area, and it is expected that some of the approaches developed&#13;
under this Project (especially concerning community participation and stakeholder management) can be&#13;
replicated in other parts of the country with IDA and donors' assistance and then later by the Government&#13;
on its own. Also, the Government has no experience with private sector management of utility operations&#13;
and, therefore, has requested IDA's assistance in designing and preparing a management contract for Taiz&#13;
as part of the pilot project. Moreover, IDA is able to provide the lessons of best practice in water sector&#13;
management and private management of water utilities. Finally, after the unification, civil war and&#13;
subsequent economic instability, the investment needs of the sector are significant and beyond the means&#13;
of the Government to finance alone. Given the country's recent agreements with the international&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                                  Taiz Water Supply Pilot Project&#13;
financial community on a macroeconomic framework, there is also little likelihood of the country being&#13;
able to access private capital markets for this sector in the foreseeable future. Thus, it must depend on&#13;
IDA and the rest of the donor community to meet the majority of its water infrastructure financing&#13;
requirements. In order to help ensure an efficient allocation of resources, IDA has also assumed a lead&#13;
role with the Government in coordinating donors' activities in the sector.&#13;
Borrower's Commitment&#13;
1.13       The Government has demonstrated considerable commitment to the Project, has requested&#13;
IDA assistance for both phases of the strategy to reduce the Taiz water crisis, and has taken measures&#13;
to involve affected rural communities in the process. It has already completed, using its own resources,&#13;
the exploration of the project-area aquifer and the drilling of five deep wells. The Government has also&#13;
issued a Presidential decree establishing NWRA and a Ministerial decree establishing the Technical&#13;
Secretariat to reform the country's water sector institutions.  Finally, the Government has recognized&#13;
that its water resources problems will only be solved over the longer term and, therefore, it has entered&#13;
into a sustained dialogue with its assistance partners and is taking measures to address water issues in a&#13;
constructive and incremental manner using a variety of forums and approaches.&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
2.1        The overall project objective is to help the Government start implementation of its water&#13;
strategy for Taiz. Specific objectives are to: (i) mitigate the immediate water shortage in Taiz (by&#13;
increasing the supply by about 100 percent); (ii) identifv new water sources to avert a sustained water&#13;
shortage crisis (to meet the needs of at least the year 2000 or about 550 lps); (iii) develop and test a&#13;
process and institutional framework for decentralized water resources management (through the&#13;
establishment of local community associations); and (iv) promote private-sector participation in the&#13;
management of water and wastewater utility services (by entering into a management contract in the&#13;
second phase of the Taiz Water Supply Project). To monitor the extent to which project objectives are&#13;
being realized, a set of monitorable indicators has been prepared (Annex 6).&#13;
Project Description&#13;
2.2        The Project will consist of three components: (i) well drilling and conveyance; (ii) a&#13;
compensation package for people in the Habir area in Ibb governorate who will be giving up water for&#13;
Taiz; and (iii) technical assistance and studies, including preparation of a management contract for the&#13;
NWSA Taiz Branch.&#13;
2.3        The first component will complete the development of the Habir well field, connect these&#13;
wells to an existing conveyance scheme (in the Al Haima area) for delivery to Taiz, provide electric&#13;
power distribution and upgrade NWSA power plant, and provide for aquifer performance monitoring&#13;
stations. The compensation component includes rural water supply schemes in Habir and Al Haima areas&#13;
and a well for Al Qhaida town, a feasibility study for one small dike for groundwater recharge and&#13;
irrigation in West Habir area, a three-classroom addition to the Hajr Bin school, and two irrigation&#13;
schemes each consisting of a well with pumping equipment and irrigation piping.&#13;
&#13;

Project Cost and Financing&#13;
2.6        The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$11.1 million, including physical and price&#13;
contingencies and about US$0.7 million spent under the existing Project Preparation Facility (PPF).&#13;
Project financing will consist of a Government contribution of about US$0.9 million and an IDA credit&#13;
of SDR 7.1 million (about US$10.2 million equivalent). Foreign and local costs are estimated at US$8.6&#13;
(including the PPF) and US$2.5 million, respectively. IDA would finance 100 percent of foreign costs&#13;
and 64 percent of local costs (US$1.6 million).&#13;
Procurement&#13;
2.7        Over 50 percent of procurement of Goods will be carried out under contracts awarded in&#13;
accordance with LIB due to the urgent nature of the project, the requirement that suppliers have&#13;
established maintenance services and spare parts stocking facilities in Yemen, and the small size of&#13;
contracts.  Accordingly, Goods (electrical and mechanical equipment) estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$500,000 equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$3,200,000 equivalent,&#13;
and Goods, which the Association agrees can only be purchased from a limited number of suppliers,&#13;
regardless of the cost thereof, will be procured under contracts awarded in accordance with LIB.&#13;
Contracts for Goods costing more than US$500,000 (piping and accessories) will be procured in&#13;
accordance with International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Works estimated to cost less than US$750,000&#13;
per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$2,000,000 equivalent, will be procured under&#13;
contracts awarded in accordance with National Competitive Bidding procedures (NCB). IDA has&#13;
reviewed the applicable national competitive bidding procurement procedures in Yemen, and found them&#13;
acceptable, with certain exceptions, such as the fact that the Government does not require parastatals to&#13;
provide bid and performance securities and that price negotiations are permitted with the lowest evaluated&#13;
bidders. The Government has agreed that these exceptions will not apply to procurement financed under&#13;
the Credit. Goods estimated to cost less than US$60,000 equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate&#13;
amount not to exceed US$150,000 equivalent, will be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of&#13;
International Shopping (IS) procedures. Goods estimated to cost less than US$40,000 equivalent per&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Taiz Water Supply Pilot Project                                                                             7&#13;
contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$100,000 equivalent, will be procured under&#13;
contracts awarded on the basis of National Shopping (NS) procedures. There will be prior review for&#13;
contracts for goods and works estimated to cost more than the equivalent of US$75,000. It is expected&#13;
that this will result in prior review for approximately 80 percent of procurement.&#13;

2.8     Historically, there has been a wide disparity between the official rate of exchange of the Yemeni&#13;
rial and the rate of exchange in the parallel market. Although this difference has narrowed recently, the&#13;
Government has agreed that contracts financed under the Credit will be expressed in currencies widely&#13;
used in international trade. There will be retroactive financing for payments made after April 1, 1996&#13;
for: (i) goods costing in the aggregate up to US$150,000 equivalent; (ii) works costing in the aggregate&#13;
up to US$150,000 equivalent, for the procurement of urgently needed electrical and mechanical&#13;
equipment, piping and accessories; and (iii) consultancy services costing in the aggregate up to&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent, to expedite studies for ground water exploration. The ground water exploration&#13;
component will be carried out by the staff of the Geology and Hydrology Department of NWRA, who&#13;
will be assisted by expatriate experts on hydrology and geology currently working for NWRA.&#13;
Consultants and any technical assistance (TA) will be hired in accordance with the Guidelines "Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as an Executing Agency (August 1981)."&#13;
During negotiations, agreement was reached on the above-mentioned procurement arrangements.&#13;

2.10         Due to the relative small project size and its urgent nature, the project will be implemented&#13;
over a three-and- a-half-year period, with a completion target date of December 31, 1999. The Closing&#13;
Date is June 30, 2000. The disbursement period of 14 quarters is deemed achievable as most investments&#13;
(about 82 percent) will take place in the first 8 quarters. The estimated schedule of disbursements from&#13;
IDA proceeds by quarters is given in Annex 5. There will be three special accounts established: (i) a&#13;
special account of US$400,000 for the components of the Project to be carried out by NWSA; (ii) a&#13;
special account of US$300,000 for the components of the Project to be carried out by NWRA and (iii)&#13;
a special account of US$300,000 for the components of the Project to be carried out by SURDU (para.&#13;
2.16).&#13;
Project Implementation&#13;
2.11         Project preparation is well advanced. Drilling and testing of five deep wells in the Habir well&#13;
field have been successfully completed, as is the design of new pipe connections from Habir well field&#13;
to the existing transmission pipeline from Al Haima well field to Taiz. Two wells are currently being&#13;
connected to Taiz on an emergency basis to compensate for the continued decline of Al Haima well field.&#13;
SURDU has also prepared prefeasibility studies for the two small dikes in west Habir and for the rural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Taiz Water Supply Pilot Project                                                       9&#13;
water supply schemes in Al Haima area. However, regarding the proposed dikes, further studies will&#13;
be needed for one of them (one dike proved to be infeasible on socio-economic and environmental&#13;
grounds) before determining its feasibility. It is expected that all four of the major mechanical and&#13;
electrical contracts (totaling about US$1.2 million) and the pipe contract (about US$1.3 million) will be&#13;
tendered and evaluated by the end of September 1996 and only awaiting Credit effectiveness before being&#13;
awarded. Similarly, civil works contracts for equipment and pipe installation can be awarded soon&#13;
thereafter; and construction of the rural water supply and irrigation schemes should be underway in early&#13;
1997.&#13;
2.12      The following three agencies will be responsible for implementing the Project: NWSA,&#13;
SURDU and NWRA. NWSA will provide overall Project coordination, including ensuring the proper&#13;
sequencing of the Project's components. NWSA will establish a Project Management Unit (PMU) in&#13;
Taiz to take full responsibility for project implementation. NWSA will be responsible for the Habir well&#13;
field development, conveyance infrastructure from Habir well field to the existing transmission pipeline&#13;
from Al Haima well field to Taiz, and the rural water supply schemes in Habir area. NWSA will also&#13;
be charged with preparing and procuring the private sector management contract and preparing the second&#13;
phase project for Taiz and Al-Qaidah town. SURDU is already located in Taiz and will appoint a project&#13;
manager and full time staff to the project. SURDU will be responsible for implementing the rural water&#13;
supply schemes in Al Haima area (including a pilot program for WID activities), and two demonstration&#13;
irrigation schemes in Habir area (two wells and corresponding irrigation piping), carrying out the study&#13;
for Wadi Warazan as a potential water resource for urban and rural development, and a feasibility study&#13;
for a recharge dike in Habir area. SURDU will also be responsible for providing administrative and&#13;
technical support to rural community associations and cooperatives, particularly on aspects of their&#13;
participation on water resources management. NWSA and SURDU both have many years of experience&#13;
with IDA-funded projects, and both also have competent project implementation units that have been&#13;
established under previous IDA projects.&#13;
2.13      NWRA will establish a PMU to coordinate and manage project implementation. NWRA will&#13;
be responsible for undertaking the ground water exploration studies in the Taiz region and for developing&#13;
the regional water management plan for Hadramawt area. This is a new entity, but it will integrate into&#13;
its organization experienced technical staff from other Government agencies and ministries. NWRA is&#13;
also the beneficiary of substantial and ongoing donor support that should help to ensure timely execution&#13;
of its project responsibilities.&#13;
2.14      NWSA, NWRA and SURDU will each be responsible for preparing withdrawal applications&#13;
and having the required audits performed in accordance with IDA guidelines.&#13;
2.15      A project Steering Committee will be established by the Government (by the Governor of&#13;
Ibb) consisting of representatives of concerned rural communities in Habir area (up to six elected&#13;
members), NWSA, SURDU, NWRA, and of the Ibb and Taiz governors. The Steering Committee will&#13;
coordinate with and ensure participation of local communities, follow-up on project implementation, and&#13;
serve as a forum to build consensus among all key players. During negotiations, agreement was reached&#13;
that the Project will be implemented by NWSA, SURDU and NWRA in accordance with the above&#13;
described implementation arrangements (paras. 2.11 through 2.15) and the Project Implementation Action&#13;
Plan and Monitoring Indicators (Annex 6).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                                                               Taiz Water Supply Pilot Project&#13;
Accounting and Auditing&#13;
2.16      NWSA, SURDU and NWRA will each keep separate accounts for project expenditures in&#13;
accordance with internationally acceptable accounting principles and practices. These accounts and the&#13;
Special Accounts will be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Association, and&#13;
copies of the audited statements will be forwarded to IDA within four months of the end of the Yemeni&#13;
fiscal year. During negotiations, agreement was reached that each implementing agency will: (i) open&#13;
a Special Account (para. 2.10); (ii) maintain separate Project Accounts; and (iii) carry out annual&#13;
independent audits in accordance with IDA Guidelines.&#13;
Supervision&#13;
2.17      The Association will supervise the project three times in the first fiscal year, and, on average,&#13;
twice yearly thereafter, combined with other missions to the country. The supervision team will consist&#13;
of a sanitary engineer and a financial analyst or private-sector specialist. At least once a year, a&#13;
hydrogeologist and a sociologist or socio economist will join supervision missions to review progress on&#13;
the ground water exploration studies and the local participation initiative, respectively. At least once a&#13;
year, IDA staff with experience in rural development (irrigation, agronomy and agro-economy) and water&#13;
resources management will also join missions to supervise the demonstration irrigation schemes and the&#13;
Hadramawt study, and to review the lessons learned from local participation in decentralized water&#13;
resources management for use in the formulation of the water strategy. Supervision missions will use&#13;
the agreed monitoring indicators as the basis to review progress. There will be a mid-term review of the&#13;
Project by April 30, 1997, during the peak construction period, to review project objectives and&#13;
implementation. Annex 4 gives details on project supervision by IDA.&#13;
Private Sector Involvement&#13;
2.18      The proposed project will promote for the first time in Yemen the involvement of the private&#13;
sector in the management of public water and wastewater utilities. The project includes preparation of&#13;
the bidding documents for a private management contract and request for tenders on a competitive basis.&#13;
Financing for the private sector management contract will be provided under the second phase project,&#13;
Taiz Water and Sanitation Project. During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government&#13;
that NWSA will:  (a) prepare the management contract documents for its Taiz Branch, which will be&#13;
completed by January 31, 1997; and (b) issue the ICB announcement for the management contract by&#13;
March 31, 1997.&#13;
Enviromnental Impact&#13;
2.19      The project is expected to have the following environmental benefits. In the area of the&#13;
existing Al Haima well field, it would: (i) help organize concerned rural communities to take an active&#13;
role in water resources management, giving emphasis to water conservation and protection of aquifer&#13;
hydrological integrity; and (ii) relieve the stress on Al Haima aquifer by reducing extraction. In the Taiz&#13;
region, the exploration of new ground water sources and studies of potential surface water sources would&#13;
enable the Government to formulate integrated water resources management plans to safeguard the&#13;
resources, as well as the socio-economic interests of affected rural communities. The Project will include&#13;
aquifer monitoring stations to measure aquifer performance over time and make operational adjustments&#13;
to protect aquifers from over-exploitation. The Project will provide substantial support to NWRA to&#13;
strengthen its role in water resources management, particularly in protecting the aquifers. The two&#13;
demonstration irrigation schemes will introduce irrigation water efficiency measures and low-water high-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Taiz Water Supply Pilot Project                                                          11&#13;
yield crops in order to conserve a scarce resource. Local communities, with vested interests in protecting&#13;
aquifers, will play a key role in the participatory approach to water resources management.&#13;
2.20      Because of the small size of the proposed works and the mitigative measures included in the&#13;
project to try to correct depletion of aquifers, and because the existing Taiz's sewage treatment plant is&#13;
currently operating below design capacity and its performance will not be affected by the additional water&#13;
supply, the project has been classified under environmental category B, with limited environmental&#13;
review.&#13;
Social Impact&#13;
2.21      The project will have a positive impact on the poor both in the city of Taiz and in rural&#13;
communities in Habir and Al Haima areas. First, water shortages have affected primarily the poor as&#13;
only middle and higher income families can afford to purchase water from private vendors. Rationing&#13;
of piped water supply affects poor families disproportionately, who now receive piped water one day&#13;
every forty days.  Second, the project will improve the living conditions of rural poor through the&#13;
provision of potable water, school rooms, demonstration irrigation schemes to improve irrigation&#13;
efficiency and high-yield cropping patterns, and organized cooperatives at the community level to help&#13;
address other socio-economic needs.&#13;
2.22      Moreover, provision of clean, reliable water will improve the welfare of women and&#13;
children. In the absence of piped water supplies, the responsibility of providing water for use at home&#13;
rests on women and children (mostly girls). In rural areas, women often walk long distances to fetch&#13;
water in plastic containers. The project will reduce time spent by women and children in carrying water.&#13;
The distribution networks and location of stand posts and washing stations of rural water supplies will&#13;
be designed taking into account local conditions and cultural traditions. The project includes a pilot&#13;
program of WID activities in two very poor villages to obtain experience in such types of initiatives for&#13;
use in future water development projects. WID activities will initially include: literacy, mother and child&#13;
health care, hygiene and first aid, water conservation and waste management (night soil, sullage and&#13;
domestic refuse management) programs. In the second year, the program will include income generation&#13;
activities for women and men in the same villages to improve the economic conditions of poor families.&#13;
The WID component will provide implementation experience for use in replicating similar initiatives&#13;
elsewhere in the country.&#13;
Project Sustainability&#13;
2.23      The Project is consistent with the evolving national water resources management strategy that&#13;
emphasizes attaining sustainable use of this scarce resource. To this end, the Project requires that water&#13;
taken from Habir area will be limited to the amount of safe yield (para 4.3). Well pumps have been sized&#13;
based on this criterion and equipment for aquifer monitoring is included in the Project to verify well field&#13;
performance. Participation of local communities and other stakeholders (NWRA) in overseeing the&#13;
management and operation of the Habir wells is an important part of the project design and will also help&#13;
to ensure sustainable water use over time. Studies to examine other potential sources of water are also&#13;
included in the Project, but again with the provision that only sustainable yields will be exploited from&#13;
any sources identified.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                                              Taiz Water Supply Pilot Project&#13;
2.24.     The long-term financial viability of the rural and Taiz water supply schemes will be addressed&#13;
through studies and TA to determine appropriate tariffs to achieve this goal. In January 1996, NWSA&#13;
raised water and wastewater tariffs by about 50 percent, and preliminary indications are that future&#13;
revenues will allow NWSA to become overall self-financing (to cover O&amp;M, debt-service and a&#13;
contribution to financing new investments). In Taiz, the financial situation is complicated by the&#13;
persistent lack of water with which to generate sales, but the Project (including the studies to identify&#13;
additional water sources for the city) will significantly increase bulk water availability over the next five&#13;
years and should, therefore, provide the basis for establishing a sustainable revenue stream for the&#13;
eventual private sector operator. The Taiz NWSA Branch's long-term financial issues will be addressed&#13;
in detail as part of the management contract preparation under the Project.&#13;
III. IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND PROJECT OPERATION&#13;
AND MAINTENANCE&#13;
Implementing Agencies&#13;
3.1        NWSA is responsible for the provision of water and wastewater services in urban areas in&#13;
the country. NWSA was established in 1973 by Law No. 13.&#13;
3.2        NWSA's functions range from establishing policies and plans to operation and maintenance&#13;
of water and sanitation services. The headquarters, located in Sana'a, designs and supervises construction&#13;
of systems from rehabilitation to new works, which are turned over to the branch offices for operation&#13;
and maintenance. NWSA headquarters reports directly to the Ministry of Electricity and Water (MOEW)&#13;
and its 22 regional branches report to the director general at headquarters. The branch offices enjoy some&#13;
degree of autonomy in the day-to-day business, however, major decisions are taken at headquarters.&#13;
3.3        For several years, NWSA has incurred financial losses, largely as a result of tariff&#13;
adjustments not having kept pace with inflation, operational inefficiencies, and the persistent lack of&#13;
water. The last audit report prepared by a private audit firm was in 1993, which shows losses of about&#13;
YRs 352 million, equivalent to about US$ 29 million at the 1993 official exchange rate (US$1 =YR 12),&#13;
or about 50 percent of the total expenditures (including debt service). The financial performance&#13;
estimates for the succeeding years also show that NWSA's financial condition is continuously&#13;
deteriorating. In line with the recent IMF's stabilization program and the Economic Recovery Credit&#13;
(IDA 2840-YEM), the Government adjusted the water tariff by about 50 percent, effective January 1996,&#13;
which is expected to help NWSA meet its 1996 operating costs. The issues of financial viability will be&#13;
addressed under the proposed Phase II project (para. 3.8).&#13;
3.4        NWSA's performance is poor due to economic and political factors (para. 1.1). Although&#13;
legally it is a semi-autonomous authority, it has lost autonomy and it now functions as a department of&#13;
the Ministry. However, a Steering Committee and a Technical Secretariat have been established (para.&#13;
1.6) to review and recommend major policy changes to reform the National Water and Sanitation&#13;
Authority.  Currently, a study to reform NWSA, coordinated by the Technical Secretariat, is ongoing&#13;
with IDA's and other donors' support. The alternative of establishing regional autonomous authorities&#13;
is being considered under which NWSA would become a policy and planning agency under MOEW. The&#13;
Regional Water and Sewerage Authorities would be established under the auspices of governors.&#13;
Presently, the Local Government Law is under review to enable local Governments to introduce such&#13;
water sector reforms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Taiz Water Supply Pilot Project                                                      13&#13;
3.5        SURDU is one of several regional rural development organizations under the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture and Water Resources (MOAWR). SURDU was established in the late 1970's to be&#13;
responsible for agricultural and rural development in the southern region of Yemen. Development&#13;
programs include agriculture extension services, rural water supply schemes, literacy and family health&#13;
programs, women in development programs, and, recently, rural roads programs. SURDU is structured&#13;
in the following operational sections: administration; engineering; operation and maintenance; water&#13;
supply; irrigation; training; and women in development. SURDU program is being funded by IDA, the&#13;
Swiss Government and IFAD. And most recently, UNCDF/UNDP has funded a roads component under&#13;
the rural Feeder Roads and Agricultural Support Services Project (YEM-91-C06) to link rural roads in&#13;
the former North and South Yemen to integrate rural communities in those areas. SURDU is also&#13;
responsible for implementing in the southern region some components of the Land and Water&#13;
Conservation Project.&#13;
3.6        NWRA, established in October 1995 by Presidential Decree No. 154, is a semi-autonomous&#13;
agency charged with water resources management. It reports directly to the Prime Minister and works&#13;
closely with sectoral ministries. A chairman was appointed in April 1996 and since then several&#13;
departments from sectoral ministries and the former High Water Council have been integrated into it.&#13;
The UNDP- and Dutch-funded technical assistance programs on water resources management are now&#13;
under the direct supervision of NWRA. Although NWRA is a new institution, it has brought under its&#13;
management structure experienced staff from sectoral ministries. For example, the Hydrogeology&#13;
Department (staff and resources) under the Geologic Survey Authority of the Ministry of Oil and Mineral&#13;
Resources is now under NWRA. This staff will assume full responsibility for the ground water&#13;
exploration program included in the project. NWRA will play an important role in developing water&#13;
resources policy and in coordinating the participation of local communities in water allocation,&#13;
conservation and monitoring.&#13;
Operation and Maintenance&#13;
3.7       In the short term, NWSA will be responsible for O&amp;M of the Taiz water supply facilities.&#13;
However, in the proposed second phase project such activities will be included under the proposed private&#13;
sector management contract. SURDU will organize and provide support to rural community cooperatives&#13;
to assume full responsibility in the O&amp;M of rural water supply schemes and irrigation schemes. It will&#13;
also provide technical assistance in estimating minimum charges for O&amp;M and on the administration of&#13;
such funds by the community cooperatives. During negotiations, agreement was reached that SURDU will&#13;
provide technical support and training to rural cooperatives for the proper operation and maintenance of&#13;
the new infrastructure provided under the project.&#13;
Cost Recovery and Affordability&#13;
3.8       The proposed first phase project, Taiz Water Supply Pilot Project, will provide only urgently&#13;
needed water supply for Taiz. Therefore, cost recovery issues (correcting management and physical&#13;
inefficiencies, providing additional water supply, improving billing and collection, and adjusting water&#13;
and sewerage tariffs) will be addressed under the proposed second phase operation, Taiz Water and&#13;
Sanitation Project, now under preparation.&#13;
3.9        Regarding cost recovery of rural infrastructure, SURDU will develop estimates of water&#13;
charges by local cooperatives responsible for the maintenance of such facilities. During the experimental&#13;
period of the irrigation demonstration project, SURDU will develop both investment and O&amp;M costs for&#13;
future use in the design of such schemes and for use by agriculture cooperatives. SURDU will also&#13;
develop O&amp;M manuals and provide technical assistance to the agriculture cooperatives. However,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                                              Taiz Water Supply Pilot Project&#13;
investments in irrigation schemes will be measured in terms of productivity gains to recover at least O&amp;M&#13;
costs. Socio-economic studies will be carried out to recommend a framework for consideration in future&#13;
projects. During negotiations, agreement was reached that SURDU will provide technical assistance to&#13;
rural cooperatives to develop cost-recovery measures to cover at least O&amp;M of rural infrastructure&#13;
provided under the project; and by December 31, 1997, the proposed program for O&amp;M of rural&#13;
infrastructure by local cooperatives will be furnished to IDA for review, and thereafter the program will&#13;
be carried out, taking IDA's comments thereon into account.&#13;
IV. PROJECT BENEFITS, RISKS AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
Benerits&#13;
4.1    Project benefits include: (i) mitigation of water scarcity in Taiz which will help reduce potential&#13;
health crises due to unsanitary conditions resulting from water shortages; (ii) reduction of stress on the&#13;
area's aquifers (by reducing over extraction by about 10 percent); (iii) provision of water to low- income&#13;
families (about 25 percent of Taiz population) who cannot afford the high price set by private water&#13;
vendors; (iv) development of a framework for participation of rural communities to improve the&#13;
management of water resources (by establishing local community associations to participate in&#13;
management of water resources; (v) formulation of a mechanism of incentives to rural communities&#13;
(representing about 3000 families) to enable water transfers to urban areas under the principles of&#13;
integrated water management; and (vi) development of a regional water management plan to prevent&#13;
uncontrolled development in the Hadramawt area.&#13;
Risks&#13;
4.2    There are three main project risks. First, although the rural communities have already agreed&#13;
to the transfer of water to Taiz and to the compensation package for the transfer, they may later request&#13;
to modify the accord in such a way as to make it unworkable. To reduce this risk, the Government and&#13;
IDA have spent considerable resources making sure that the agreed arrangement is both reasonable and&#13;
sustainable. Further, it is likely that modifications of the agreement will later be necessary to account&#13;
for changing circumstances and, therefore, constructing an open channel for ongoing negotiations was&#13;
an objective in the design of this component. In this regard, the Steering Committee already discussed&#13;
(para. 2.14) will oversee the implementation of the agreement and serve as an ongoing forum for&#13;
discussion and problem resolution.&#13;
4.3    The second risk is that water extraction will exceed the agreed sustainable yield of the effected&#13;
aquifers. Mining of the groundwater would not only reduce the amount of water available to both Taiz&#13;
and rural communities, it would also have an adverse impact on performance of the private sector&#13;
management contract. To reduce this risk, safe yields of the aquifers have been established for the Habir&#13;
well field and agreed with NWSA and NWRA. Actual abstractions will be monitored with equipment&#13;
provided by the Project, and monitoring activities will be sanctioned on a regular basis by stakeholders&#13;
(NWRA, NWSA and representatives of the local communities). A study of one small dike for ground&#13;
water recharge is also part of the Project. If the study proves that construction of a recharge dike is&#13;
feasible, consideration would be given to fund such a project under the second phase project for Taiz.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Taiz Water Supply Pilot Project                                                          15&#13;
Finally, the Project contains resources to study and identify alternative sources of water for Taiz to be&#13;
developed under Phase II. This additional water will also help to insure that there is less exploitation of&#13;
the wells developed under Phase I.&#13;
4.4    The third risk is that the Government may be unable to put in place the management contract for&#13;
Taiz, thus undermining the sustainability of the Project. The pilot nature of the project has been chosen&#13;
to address this risk by ensuring that an effective institutional framework is implemented in Phase II of&#13;
the strategy.&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
4.5    The Project's economic rate of return (ERR) is about 55 percent under Base Case assumptions.&#13;
As described fully in Annex 8 and the Project File, the economic analysis models a series of cost and&#13;
benefit streams under the Project to provide urban and rural potable water and rural irrigation water.&#13;
Technical Assistance and Studies, as well as components targeted to addressing women's poverty issues,&#13;
are also included as part of the overall analysis. The analysis makes modest assumptions for unaccounted&#13;
for water percentages (decreasing from the current rate at 50 percent to 25 percent in year seven), and&#13;
attempts to realistically portray O&amp;M and energy costs, equipment replacement, benefits from the rural&#13;
potable water and irrigation components and implementation speed. For the urban potable water portion&#13;
of the analysis, the city's demand curve for water was estimated using actual vendor and NWSA prices,&#13;
thereby allowing total benefits and the per cubic meter value for water delivered under the Project to be&#13;
calculated. This methodology results in a relatively high value for water delivered to Taiz compared to&#13;
existing tariffs and is, therefore, an important contribution to the Project's ERR. However, this value&#13;
is well below observed vendor prices in Taiz and is, therefore, considered a reasonable calculation for&#13;
use in the Base Case model.&#13;
4.6    The sensitivity of the Project's ERR was tested under three scenarios. Scenario A tests the&#13;
Project using the risks outlined in paras. 4.2 to 4.4. In this context, the amount of water allowed to go&#13;
to Taiz is reduced, the value of compensation requested by the rural population increased, and the&#13;
quantity of water flowing from the wells is reduced to simulate over-exploitation. Under the second&#13;
scenario (Scenario B), costs are increased by 15 percent and benefits delayed by three years in order to&#13;
model both construction cost and implementation uncertainty. Finally, Scenario C takes into account that&#13;
the value of water (as described in the previous paragraph) going to Taiz from Habir could be over&#13;
estimated. In this analysis, the value of water is set at NWSA's current marginal tariff for domestic&#13;
customers and then adjusted upwards gradually throughout the first seven years of Project life to reflect&#13;
modest rate increases.&#13;
4.7    Table 4.1 shows the ERR under the Base Case and the three sensitivity scenarios.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN&#13;
TAIZ WATER SUPPLY PILOT PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ACTION PLAN AND MONITORING INDICATORS&#13;
A. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION (BY NWSA)&#13;
1.    NWSA will establish a Project Management Unit (PMU) in Taiz, headed by a full-time project&#13;
manager who will assume full responsibility for all aspects of the project, and staffed with two engineers,&#13;
an accountant, two drivers, a technician, and a secretary. Two 4-WD vehicles will be assigned to the&#13;
project as well as office equipment (telephone, fax, computer, photocopier), and office facilities. The&#13;
project manager will coordinate with NWRA and SURDU and will provide all necessary support and&#13;
information as required for an expeditious project execution. NWSA will work closely with SURDU and&#13;
NWRA in locating the proposed irrigation wells. In this regard, hydrogeologists of both agencies will&#13;
exchange information and discuss in a collegial manner the best alternative options and specifications for&#13;
wells. Also, based on information provided by SURDU for the location of water tap connections in the&#13;
Al Haima transmission pipe, NWSA will install the connections with valves, which will be extended to&#13;
about ten meters from the transmission pipe to enable SURDU to extend the service to the villages.&#13;
NWSA will also provide power service from its transmission line for the service pumping stations where&#13;
required. SURDU will provide the required transformers and electric switch gear at each service&#13;
pumping station. NWSA will work closely with NWRA on those aspects of well design, monitoring and&#13;
reporting. NWSA will be responsible for operating and maintaining the production and monitoring wells&#13;
and report to NWRA on a monthly basis. NWSA project manager will be responsible for coordinating&#13;
with the Project Steering Committee established by the Governor of Ibb to keep local communities in&#13;
Habir well informed before any major work is executed. This aspect of the project is of utmost&#13;
importance to avoid any misunderstandings of local farmers who could delay project execution. In this&#13;
regard, implementation of the rural water supply schemes in Habir will be done in parallel with the Taiz&#13;
water supply. NWSA will implement the project components under its responsibility in accordance with&#13;
the following implementation schedule:&#13;

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN&#13;
TAIZ WATER SUPPLY PILOT PROJECT&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR STUDIES&#13;
A.    SOCIO-ECONOMIC STUDIES FOR WADI WARAZAN AND WADI Al JA'ASHIN DIKES&#13;
1.    Objective. The objective of the study is to determine the impact the proposed dikes in Wadi&#13;
Ja'ashin and Wadi Warazan would have on the social and economic structure of inhabitants living&#13;
downstream and upstream of the dikes.&#13;
2.    Scope.  The study will include an evaluation of the present social structure of the area and the&#13;
economic activities. It will assess the importance of agriculture to local economies and to what extent&#13;
it depends on wadi flows. The study area downstream would extend as far downstream as possible to&#13;
determine the use of flood flows by riparian. In the case of Wadi Ja'ashin dike, the area of study will&#13;
be limited to Wadi Al Haima. In the case of Wadi Warazan, the study will extend to at least 50 km&#13;
downstream and about 5 km upstream. The study will obtain data, such as population and composition&#13;
by sex and age, general economic setting and trends, sources of income, income distribution, employment&#13;
opportunities outside agriculture, social infrastructure (schools, health centers, water supply and&#13;
sanitation), and economic infrastructure (access roads, agriculture extension services, banking services).&#13;
The study will determine production costs of water, land ownership and tenure, break-down of production&#13;
cost for main crops, crop prices, conflicts on water and conflict resolution, attitude towards change, and&#13;
perceived problems regarding water. The study will explain local leadership and organization, outline&#13;
of public administration, and institutions related to water working in the area.&#13;
3.    Approach. Consultants will be hired in accordance with IDA guidelines. The study is estimated&#13;
to cost about US$80,000. The study will consist of data research and field surveys. The latter will cover&#13;
representative areas and families to enable extrapolating the analysis and assessment of perceived impacts&#13;
of the proposed dikes. Field interviews will be documented for future reference.&#13;
4.    Reports. The consultant will submit ten copies of a draft report for review by SURDU and IDA&#13;
within four months of signing the contract, and fifteen copies of the final report within six weeks from&#13;
the date official written comments are received by the consultant.&#13;
B.    WOMEN's ACTIVITIES PILOT PROGRAM&#13;
5.    Objectives. The objectives of this program are two-fold: (i) to learn from experience about social&#13;
and economic activities which should be integrated in water development schemes to mitigate and&#13;
compensate for loss of water resources transferred from rural to urban areas; and (ii) to improve the&#13;
conditions of rural women, particularly when provision of rural water supply would free them from a&#13;
tedious and time-consuming chore enabling them to occupy their time in productive activities. The study&#13;
would also develop approaches and methodologies, evaluate acceptability of program by beneficiaries,&#13;
determine costs and requirements for sustainability and replicability in other areas facing similar situations&#13;
and with similar socio-economic characteristics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
6.    Scope. The program would be implemented gradually in stages. In the design of the program,&#13;
SURDU will benefit from its experience in similar cases. In the first stage, which would extend for about&#13;
one year, the program would focus on literacy classes and training activities such as: hygiene, nutrition,&#13;
mother and child care, primary health and first aid, water conservation and awareness, and sanitation&#13;
(safe garbage, sullage and night soil disposal). In the second stage, which would extend for about two&#13;
years, the program would introduce income generating activities for both women and men in the villages.&#13;
Income generating activities include: animal husbandry, handcrafts, and micro-enterprises. Income&#13;
generation activities would be designed to provide technical assistance and training, basic management&#13;
skills, marketing support, and micro credit support. Regarding the latter, the WID extension workers&#13;
would seek the support of already established programs providing such credit facilities and would inform&#13;
and guide the beneficiaries in how to benefit from such facilities. The program would start modestly,&#13;
with a few families in one village to better assess the feasibility of such an approach.&#13;
7.    Pilot Area. The area selected to test the WID program would include two villages in lower Al&#13;
Haima, an area which suffered the most as a result of the collapse of Al Haima aquifer due to over&#13;
exploitation for the Taiz water supply and local irrigation. The following villages have been identified:&#13;
Shahrah (1017 inhabitants) and Rahbah (101 inhabitants).&#13;
8.    Study Duration.  The study would extend over a period of three years at the end of which a&#13;
workshop would be held to discuss the findings, conclusions and recommendations.&#13;
9.    Linkage to Other Activities. The program would attempt to coordinate and benefit from IDA&#13;
initiatives, such as the Social Fund and Public Works Program, which could provide financial support&#13;
to some of these activities. For instance, the Public Works Program could provide grant financing for&#13;
improving the access road to the two villages included in the WID program. Also, coordination with&#13;
activities sponsored by donors and NGOs would be considered.&#13;

required outputs should be ready and discussed with the project management by end August 1996. In&#13;
view of the urgency of the study, these deadlines will be strictly adhered to, and there will be no&#13;
extension in the duration of the contract.&#13;
Payment Conditions&#13;
18.   The contractor will be paid in three installments as per the following schedule:&#13;
First installment:   30% of the total fees at the end of the first month when the resources&#13;
have been mobilized and field work has been started.&#13;
Second installment:   30% of the total fees at the time when field work needed to produce the&#13;
required outputs has been completed.&#13;
Third installment:    40% of the total fees at the end of the contract period based on the&#13;
acceptance of draft reports/outputs, and that all outputs have been handed&#13;
over to the project management, including transfer of raw/processed data&#13;
collected during the course of the study.&#13;
All payments will be made upon the certification of the project CTA and subsequent approval of the&#13;
UN/UNDDSMS that work has been satisfactorily performed in accordance with the terms of reference&#13;
of the contract.&#13;
Special Requirements&#13;
19.   One of the main objectives of the Project YEM/93/010 is to strengthen the technical and&#13;
institutional capacities of NWRA in performing its functions and mandates. Therefore, it is important&#13;
that the selected contractor should include those national professionals/institutions in the study team who&#13;
are expected to be part of the future NWRA staff. The contractors should specifically explain in their&#13;
proposals that how the technical capabilities of these institutions/professionals will be strengthened. For&#13;
each component of the study, the contractor should review all the relevant work that has been carried out&#13;
in the past, and make best use of the previous work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 7 of 8&#13;
20.   The financial proposal should reflect separate cost estimates for each component of the study, if&#13;
contractors are submitting proposals for more than one component.&#13;
21.   All raw/processed data collected/compiled during the course of the study will be the property of&#13;
NWRA. The contractor should provide this data to the project together with the final report since it will&#13;
have to be utilized for groundwater modelling exercise at a later stage.&#13;
22.   The project management reserves the right to reject any or all proposals without assigning any&#13;
reason.&#13;
23.   Other special requirements in terms of fulfilling contract obligations will be reflected in the&#13;
contract agreement between UNDDSMS/UNDP and the contractor.&#13;
E.   WATER RESOURCES EXPLORATION STUDIES FOR THE CITY OF TAIZ BY NWRA&#13;
Objectives&#13;
24.   The objectives of these studies are to identify, explore and test new groundwater sources to supply&#13;
the city of Taiz with potable water to meet at least projected water demands through the year 2000.&#13;
Approach&#13;
25.   The study will be carried out by the staff of NWRA with technical assistance provided by&#13;
expatriate experts on hydrogeology. The study will be done in the following three phases:&#13;
(i)    Phase 1, identification of prospective areas with potential for groundwater development&#13;
within the Taiz region;&#13;
(ii)   Phase 2, geophysical exploration of areas with optimistic potential for development, in&#13;
order to identify areas suitable for exploratory drilling and pump testing of aquifers; and&#13;
(iii)   Phase 3, exploratory drilling and pump testing of aquifers to determine water sources&#13;
yields and well field development parameters.&#13;
Phase 1&#13;
26.   Phase 1 will include a detailed study of existing geological maps and hydrological data for the&#13;
study area. NWRA's experts will study and analyze geology, structures, relief, wadi catchments, and&#13;
other natural physical characteristics, in order to identify prospective areas. The following seven areas&#13;
have been identified in earlier preliminary studies: (i) Wadi Al Asabah-Wadi Al Haima; (ii) Wadi As&#13;
Sawami; (iii) Wadi Bahsus-Wadi Rahabar (Hadjah westward); (iv) Wadi Bani Khawlan; (v) At Turbah;&#13;
(vi) Wadi Warazan (Ar Rahidah); and (vii) Wadi Sawdan. Phase 1 will be carried out over a period of&#13;
about one to two months.&#13;
27.   The study will comprise the following activities: (i) collection, analysis and generalization of all&#13;
geological, hydrological and geophysical data available for about 1,600 square km, that is, areas located&#13;
within a radius of about 40 km from the city of Taiz; (ii) analysis of surface water, rainfall and climatic&#13;
data; and (iii) interpretation of remote sensing data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 8 of 8&#13;
Phase 2&#13;
28.    Phase 2 will consist of geophysical studies of selected areas of about 300 sq. km.  The main&#13;
activities are: (i) geophysical logging, electric profiling, vertical and circular sounding and nuclear&#13;
magnetic resonance; (ii) geological and groundwater field observations; (iii) reconnaissance routes; and&#13;
(iv) inventory of selective existing wells in the area. This phase will be carried out over a period of&#13;
about two to three months.   The output of this phase will be: (i) maps (1:100,000 scale) of&#13;
geomorphology, geology and hydrogeology; (ii) explanatory notes to maps; and (iii) identification of sites&#13;
for exploratory drilling and testing including preparation of relevant specifications and tender documents.&#13;
Phase 3&#13;
29.    Phase 3 will consist of exploratory drilling and pump testing.  Based on tender documents&#13;
prepared in phase 2, NWRA will tender the exploratory drilling studies in accordance with National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures. NWRA will supervise the exploratory drilling and based on the&#13;
findings of the study, it will give specific recommendations for well field development. It is estimated&#13;
that Phase 3 will extend over a period of about nine to ten months, including the period of time for&#13;
tendering (about three months).&#13;

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN&#13;
TAIZ WATER SUPPLY PILOT PROJECT&#13;
ECONOMIC AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The economic analysis models a series of cost and benefit streams under the Project to provide&#13;
urban and rural potable water and rural irrigation water. Technical Assistance and Studies, as well as&#13;
the Women in Development components, are also included as part of the overall analysis. The Project's&#13;
Base Case economic rate of return is approximately 55 percent (see Table 1).&#13;
2.    The economic and sensitivity analysis adopts a conservative view, with risks estimated at a level&#13;
considered only remotely possible and benefits modestly stated. For example, in the unlikely event that&#13;
the amount of water from the well field was reduced by 30 percent, plus farmers wanted to increase the&#13;
amount of water retained in the rural areas for irrigation by 15 percent (thereby reducing water available&#13;
to Taiz), and the investment for irrigation infrastructure was doubled, the Project's ERR would still be&#13;
over 26 percent (see sensitivity analysis Scenario A). In all the analyses, unaccounted for water (UFW)&#13;
percentages in Taiz are realistically portrayed (currently at about 50 percent and are only reduced to 25&#13;
percent over the coming seven years-even after completion of the proposed Phase II project that will&#13;
specifically address this problem). Additional water provided to Taiz under the Project is valued in the&#13;
Base Case at its economic value determined from the city's estimated demand curve based on the&#13;
observed cost of vendor water and current NWSA tariffs. This estimate is, however, considered well&#13;
below its true economic value if the additional externalities of a reliable and potable water supply could&#13;
be determined. Similarly, modest benefit assumptions are made for the rural potable water supply and&#13;
irrigated agriculture components. A full description of the model, assumptions and scenarios follows and&#13;
detailed tables are available in the Project File.&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
3.    Costs. Cost streams are divided into rural and conveyance (Taiz potable water supply) portions&#13;
to represent the Project's investment, operation and maintenance costs over a 20-year period. Major&#13;
investment items are for civil works, pumping equipment, generators, piping and related equipment, well&#13;
housing structures, vehicles and a small amount of office and surveying equipment. Using manufacturers'&#13;
specifications, the conveyance portion of the Project is estimated to use 5,700 kWh/day, while the rural&#13;
part of the Project is estimated to consume 600 kWh/day. Energy costs are estimated at world prices for&#13;
electricity supplied by diesel units at the well field, or YR 13.5/kWh (US$0. 10/kWh). The analysis also&#13;
includes a major rehabilitation of the Project's pumping and drive equipment at year 10; assumed to be&#13;
50 percent of the original cost.&#13;
4.    Operations and maintenance costs (O&amp;M) are estimated at a percentage of initial investment&#13;
(including the pro rata share of civil works for installation and project management), except for vehicles&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
that are assumed to have operating costs of $4,000 per year for the first five years, and then retired at&#13;
a salvage cost of zero. The percentages used for O&amp;M are as follows:&#13;
Item                                    O&amp;M Percentage&#13;
Equipment                                                        2.00%&#13;
Major Structures                                                 2.00%&#13;
Piping, Fittings, Valves, Well Head                              1.00%&#13;
5.     Benefits. By the time of full development, water from eight of the nine proposed wells are&#13;
expected to yield about 173 liters per second (Ips) or 5,456 million cubic meters (MCM) per year under&#13;
the Base Case. Well No. 2 is yet to be completed and, therefore, it is not included in the analysis.&#13;
Projected annual distribution of the water is: Taiz 140 lps (4,415 MCM); potable water for rural areas&#13;
at just over 10 lps (394 MCM); and about 21 lps (647 MCM) for irrigation uses. As some wells are&#13;
more developed than others, water availability is assumed to be 40 percent in year zero of the analysis,&#13;
80 percent in year one and 100 percent by year two.&#13;
6.    Irrigation benefits are based on a Farm model constructed for the economic analysis (included&#13;
in the Project File). Input costs include seeds, livestock use, tractor hire, labor, fertilizers, pesticides and&#13;
irrigation water. Imported inputs are valued at international import parity prices. Yields are based on&#13;
observed farm gate prices in the project area. Current summer crops in the project area consist of qat&#13;
(30 percent), sorghum (20 percent), maize (45 percent), tomatoes (5 percent). In winter, sorghum and&#13;
maize decrease while potatoes are added. In addition, approximately 25 percent of the land lies fallow&#13;
during the winter months. With and without Project scenarios were analyzed in the Farm model, based&#13;
on the amount of water available from the Project and extensive interviews with farmers in the Habir&#13;
area. After taking into account the amount of water conveyed to Taiz and the potable water needs of the&#13;
rural population, the project is expected to yield about 647,00 m3 per year for irrigation purposes. Based&#13;
on farmer responses and a review of several IDA's Project Completion Reports (Yemen: Southern&#13;
Regional Agricultural Development Project Implementation Completion Report No. 15561 and Fifth&#13;
Tihama Regional Agricultural Development Project Implementation Completion Report No. 15620), about&#13;
13,000 m3 is required per hectare for a typical cropping mix in the area. For this analysis, and based&#13;
on farmer interviews, growers are expected to increase their yield of all existing crops (except qat) as a&#13;
result of the increased availability of irrigation water, with the largest incremental benefits coming from&#13;
winter tomatoes, potatoes and straw. In addition, the Project will permit all land to be cultivated year&#13;
round. If a typical winter and summer cropping mix is assumed for the additional area to be provided&#13;
with irrigation, about 50 additional hectares could be irrigated as a result of the Project. With these&#13;
assumptions, the Project is expected to yield about $53,000 in annual incremental benefits by the year&#13;
2000.&#13;
7.     The Project will also produce potable water in the rural areas. The amount available per annum&#13;
is determined by estimating the population to be served (3000 families, with 6 people per family, equals&#13;
a total population served of about 18,000), and the liters per capita per day of consumption (60). This&#13;
means that about 394,000 m3 per year will be used for rural potable water supply. The benefits from&#13;
potable water supply modeled in the analysis are based on the time saved by women and girls performing&#13;
water-related chores and an estimated shadow wage rate for their time. Local interviews found that the&#13;
family wage rate for farm work was about YR 150 (US$1.11) per day and, in the economic analysis, a&#13;
wage rate of YR 5.00 (US$0.04) per hour was assumed for those family members spent in water-related&#13;
&#13;

activities. This estimated wage takes into account the wide age dispersion of the female population&#13;
occupied with fetching potable water, washing clothes and watering animals. Field observations show&#13;
that women and girls spend up to eight hours per day in providing water for the household and livestock,&#13;
mostly as a result of the long distances to water sources and the modest amounts available from depleted&#13;
wells and seasonably variable springs. The Project will provide reliable and plentiful water at points&#13;
close to existing settlements, therefore the economic analysis assumes that about 2 hours per day per&#13;
person will be saved by its rural potable water component. Under these assumptions and by the third&#13;
year of the Project when water from all wells will be available, annual benefits are estimated at about&#13;
US$49,000. There will also be substantial externalities for the provision of potable water to the rural&#13;
population (e.g., improved health or as an input to employment generating activities) but, because of the&#13;
difficulty in quantifying them, these have not been included in the analysis.&#13;
8.     Urban potable water benefits are quantified for the expected 140 liters per second flow (4,415&#13;
MCM) that will be annually available in Taiz as a result of the Project. The economic value of this water&#13;
was estimated by calculating consumer and NWSA benefits under the Project (using vendor prices and&#13;
NWSA's marginal tariff). Based on current studies in Taiz, vendor prices for potable water average&#13;
about YR 550 (US$4.07) per m3, but are seasonally higher in some summer months (see C. Handley,&#13;
"Taiz Household Water Study", January 1996, in the Project File). For purposes of the economic&#13;
analysis, a demand curve for the city is estimated using the observed vendor price of YR 550 with a&#13;
quantity supplied of 120,000 m3 per month, and the existing marginal block NWSA of YR 40 with a total&#13;
demand of 1,200 million m' per month. If the demand function is assumed to be linear, then a price for&#13;
water supplied with the Project can be estimated (see Figure 1). The resulting estimated price (YR&#13;
375/m3) is then used to calculate NWSA and consumer benefits as a result of the Project. (Given the&#13;
analysis' long time horizon, water sold by vendors is assumed to be priced at their long-run marginal&#13;
cost, so there is no economic benefit from their supply.) The total benefit to both consumers and NWSA&#13;
is then divided by the amount of water provided to Taiz after the Project is implemented (482 million&#13;
m3/month), yielding an economic price of YR 339/in3, which is the Base Case amount.&#13;
9.     The economic model assumes that UFW is 50 percent in Taiz for years zero through two of the&#13;
Project, reduces to 30 percent for the next five years, and then to 25 percent for the remainder of the&#13;
analysis.&#13;
10.    Depletion costs (from well exploitation) and recharge benefits (from irrigation) are not included&#13;
in the analysis because it is envisaged that the Project will not result in mining of the aquifer. The&#13;
Project seeks to ensure sustainable water extraction through: (i) the importance it places on educating the&#13;
population about the dangers of water mining; (ii) relating the already well-known experience that&#13;
neighboring Al Haima had with wells running dry; and (iii) the provision of monitoring equipment and&#13;
procedures to be put in place to prevent over-exploitation. Despite these precautions, sensitivity Scenario&#13;
A below includes the effect of a 30 percent decrease in water availability. (Scenario A should also&#13;
include a cost for depletion but the size of existing aquifers are not yet known and therefore, no "mining&#13;
costs" are included.)&#13;
11.    Economic Return. The Base Case analysis, using the assumptions described above, shows an&#13;
economic rate of return for the Project of about 55 percent. At 10 percent discount rate, the net present&#13;
value equals just over US$37.3 million (see Table 1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;

Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
12.   Three sensitivity scenarios are modeled to test possible outcomes in project risk. In Scenario A,&#13;
the three risks outlined in the SAR are analyzed. In this context; (i) the rural population may change its&#13;
agreement with NWSA by reducing the amount of water allowed to go to Taiz; (ii) it could demand more&#13;
compensation for the transfer of the water; and (iii) the wells could be exploited beyond their sustainable&#13;
yield leading to a decrease in the overall water available. Thus, for Scenario A the amount of water&#13;
extracted is reduced by 30 percent from the Base Case assumption, and the water allowed to flow to Taiz&#13;
is also decreased by 15 percent. The latter adjustment would increase the amount of water available for&#13;
irrigation, increasing the potential irrigated area by about 140 hectares. This, in turn, would prompt an&#13;
increase in irrigation investment, thus Scenario A increases the capital cost for this item by $375,000,&#13;
or about 50 percent over the Base Case. For the reasons outlined in para. II above, depletion costs are&#13;
not included.&#13;
13.    Under Scenario B, Base Case project costs (including technical assistance, studies and energy)&#13;
are increased by 15 percent and project benefits are delayed by 3 years.&#13;
14.   Scenario C takes into account that the economic value of water from Habir could be over&#13;
estimated. Therefore, the vendor price used in Base Case is decreased so that it equals the highest&#13;
current NWSA residential block tariff for water (YR 40/m3) in years zero and two, and then only&#13;
increases by 15 percent over the remainder of the analysis (to reflect the potential problem NWSA, or&#13;
a private management contractor, could have in raising tariffs). With this assumption, the highest water&#13;
block tariff would reach only YR 80/m3 (US$0.59) by year six and remain at this level for the rest of the&#13;
Project.&#13;
15.    Economic rates of return for the Base Case and three scenarios are sunmmarized in the following&#13;
table:&#13;
Scenario                           ERR (%)&#13;
Base                                55&#13;
A                                 27&#13;
B                                 23&#13;
C                                  5&#13;
16.   The Project is most sensitive to the assumed price level of water sold to Taiz. For example,&#13;
lowering the Base Case price by 50 percent to YR 170/rn3, then the Project's ERR falls to about 23&#13;
percent. To lower the Base Case ERR to zero, then a starting price of YR 64/m3 would be necessary--or&#13;
about 19 percent of the Base Case price. Similarly, the analysis is sensitive to the amount of water&#13;
available to Taiz. For example, if the amount of water was decreased by 30 percent to 98 Ips, then the&#13;
ERR reduces to about 36 percent.&#13;
17.    In contrast, an increase in costs by 15 percent only reduces the ERR by about 5 percent,&#13;
demonstrating that the Project should be less sensitive to cost overruns or modest construction delays.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Taiz Water Supply Pilot
            Project's main objectives are to mitigate the immediate
            water shortage in the city of Taiz and identify new water
            sources to avert a sustained water shortage. The project
            also aims at developing and testing an institutional
            framework for decentralized water resource management
            through local community participation and promoting private
            sector participation in the management of water and
            wastewater utility services. The project consists of three
            components: a) well drilling and conveyance to Taiz; b) a
            compensation package for people in the Habir area who will
            give up water for Taiz, consisting of rural water supply
            schemes that include a pilot program of activities targeted
            at women; two demonstration irrigation schemes including
            wells, piping and technical assistance; school rooms; and
            studies for an aquifer recharge dike in Habir area; and c)
            studies of surface and ground water sources for urban and
            rural development; technical assistance for the preparation
            of a second phase project for Taiz city and Al Qaidah town;
            and preparation of a management contract for Taiz National
            Water and Sanitation Authority branch for implementation in
            the second phase project.
