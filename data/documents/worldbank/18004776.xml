&#13;
                     A CONVERSATION WITH RICHARD WESTEBBE                   consisted of the PL 480 programs, which I negotiated on behalf of the&#13;

                                                                            various economic ministers.     The job was paid half by the Bank of&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     This is Robert Oliver about to begin a conversation with        Greece and half by the government itself.       I worked closely with the&#13;
&#13;
Richard Westebbe. Dick, I think it's well to start by asking you to         Minister of Economic Coordination, of Commerce, of Industry, the&#13;
&#13;
introduce yourself, say what you were doing before you came to the          central bank governor, and occasionally the Prime Minister.&#13;
&#13;
Bank, and then talk generally about your experiences in the Bank.           OLIVER:     Was there no IBRD component at all?&#13;
&#13;
WESTEBBE:     I came to the Bank in August, 1966, from a very unusual job   WESTEBBE:     The IBRD hadn't lent to Greece.     That's an interesting&#13;
&#13;
that doesn't exist any longer.     Between 1960 and 1966, I was what was    poipt that you raise.     Greece was not eligible for IBRD lending&#13;
&#13;
called the Executive Director of the Foreign Trade Administration           because it was still in default on its external debts.          One feature of&#13;
&#13;
(FTA) in the Greek Government, which was an agency set up during the        this job was my first exposure to the IBRD. I remember discussing it&#13;
&#13;
Marshall Plan at the request of the Congress to be sure that the use        on various times with the governor of the central bank and the deputy&#13;
&#13;
of the foreign exchange by the Greek Government would conform to            governor.     (Actually the deputy governor was in charge of negotiations&#13;
&#13;
useful purposes and would, in fact, be allocated through import             on the foreign debt.)     The American foreign bondholder's council was&#13;
&#13;
licenses approved by the FTA.     By 1960, the need for import licenses     very, very tough on the Greeks, writing very harsh reports about&#13;
&#13;
was vastly diminished, the economy was on the way to full recovery,         Greece's unwillingness to pay despite its recovery.        The basic issue&#13;
&#13;
but the Greek government had decided that it wanted to have a senior        wasn't the unwillingess to pay, it was simply that the Greeks were in&#13;
&#13;
advisor to perform the remaining functions of this agency, which had a      a politically difficult position.     Although there was essentially a&#13;
&#13;
Greek staff in Washington and in Athens.     Athens was the headquarters.   right-wing government in power during most of that period, the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         3                                                                              4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
government felt that if it signed an agreement to settle with the           OLIVER:     Was there a go between in some sense between the World Bank&#13;
&#13;
American bondholders and if the same bondholders gave a more favorable      and the borrowing government?&#13;
&#13;
agreement subsequently to the Yugoslavs, a communist government, they       WESTEBBE:     Yes there was.    The reason this was a critical issue was&#13;
&#13;
would be harshly criticized.    The question was how to find a way out      that the World Bank was refusing to lend.        George Woods was taking the&#13;
&#13;
of it.                                                                      position you have to settle these foreign debts.        The Bank had a&#13;
&#13;
     I was fortunate to be in a position to assist them in this,            policy in this respect.        It was in '64, the second !time I came with&#13;
&#13;
because, on one of my trips to New York, I talked to one of the big         the Greek     Minister of Coordination and the Prime Minister.      The Prime&#13;
&#13;
commercial bank's senior vice presidents.    He said to me, "Why don't      Minister was coming here to see President Johnson on Cyprus.         I came&#13;
&#13;
you go over to see the foreign bondholder counsel director, an ex           along with his economic        minister, which happened to be his&#13;
&#13;
professor.   See if you can't see how to resolve the problem.     I did     son,Andreas Papendreaus. We visited George Woods.        George Woods in&#13;
&#13;
that. The chap, of course, gave me the official position.     I told him    that meeting made the point to Andreas.        He said, "Look, I like what&#13;
&#13;
what the Greek problem was. I said, "Why don't we work out a formula        you are telling me. I accept your promise that you will settle the&#13;
&#13;
which would satisfy both sides which is that they will settle with you      foreign debt within the foreseeable future, and on that basis I agree&#13;
&#13;
on terms that you have already been offered, but that they will not         to start lending to Greece.        That first loan was organized at that&#13;
&#13;
settle finally.    Either side will have the right to suspend the           fir~t   session somewhere in the summer of '64 and then with the&#13;
&#13;
agreement in five years without any questions being asked.      That way,   agreement I just described already in hand with the American Foreign&#13;
&#13;
if you sign a better deal with the Yugoslavs which you will obviously       Bondholders Council, it was easy to settle with the Europeans and the&#13;
&#13;
do, the Greeks could, if the deals becomes politically difficult,           others.     There was a model or precedent that everybody could follow.&#13;
&#13;
suspends theirs.   At least they can make the case in Parliament that       OLIVER:     But would George Woods have agreed to have taken you on so to&#13;
&#13;
they haven't given away the store."    He bought it.   I went back and      speak in the absence of the go between between you and the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
sold it to the governor of the central bank, who then told me also          WESTEBBE:     Well, I don't think we would have been able to make the&#13;
&#13;
that that's excellent because in the meantime I will have purchased         case or the commitment to settle it if we didn't know we had it in&#13;
&#13;
all these bonds on the market at something like 50 cents on the dollar      hand.     He just would have said it is impossible to sign these things&#13;
&#13;
anyway, and we won't be in debt in five years.    So the issue becomes      over night.     They needed elaborate arrangements, texts, treaties and&#13;
&#13;
mute. That's about what happened.                                           so forth.     Andreas was able to do that because he knew he had the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                          5                                                                           6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
basis of the deal with the bondholder's council.                             subject to pressures within Greece.     That was another condition. The&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER:     Was there a similar difficulty in arranging for the         money that was mobilized was fairly significant     for defense support,&#13;
&#13;
payment of bonds to other territories?                                       and the use of these funds had to be carefully understood.&#13;
&#13;
WESTEBBE:     No, that in fact was a lot easier.   The basic terms were      Furthermore, there were a number of ways in which people could have&#13;
&#13;
the same as the Americans.     The, question of the Yugoslavs came up in     benefited if the wrong procedures were used and the wrong people were&#13;
&#13;
both cases, and they couldn't sign any of the agreements as a result.        favored internally. I don't want to go into detail,' but it was&#13;
&#13;
There were two separate negotiations, one with the Europeans and one         essentially that, from the outset, they didn't want to put a Greek&#13;
&#13;
with the Americans.     Essentially the same deal prevailed, though once     under pressure to one group or another.     As a result, I was by&#13;
&#13;
we got the American bond holders to sign, the others fell in line.           legislation a member of the Foreign Trade Board, which consisted of&#13;
&#13;
The Americans iâ&#128;¢. fact Were the tougher of the two.                          the Prime Minister, all the economic ministers and the governor of the&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Well I interrupted you.                                          central bank. I was officially a member because I held that job.     The&#13;
&#13;
WESTEBBE:     Well, following this job was a fascinating, perhaps a          job, by the way, in     legislation had to be held by an American hired&#13;
&#13;
unique experience for a professional economist because not only were         by the Greek Government.     The requirement for an American was put in&#13;
&#13;
you in charge of a staff of Greek civil servants who were programming        by the Congress back in the Truman Doctrine days, but they had the&#13;
&#13;
this aid, issuing procurement authorizations.      We were still signing     rig~t   to hire and fire.   It also meant that I had a veto of foreign&#13;
&#13;
some of the licenses.     (About 10 percent of the imports were still        trade policy decisions, because they needed a unanimous vote for every&#13;
&#13;
licensed--essentially strategic goods and things of that sort.)        But   decision; any external procurement over $50,000 and had to be approved&#13;
&#13;
it had a much more interesting dimension which is essentially why the        by the committee as well as any policy decision.&#13;
&#13;
government of the Central Bank wanted to continue it after the               OLIVER:     Did you have any occasion to exercise the veto?&#13;
&#13;
Marshall Plan period had expired and well after Greece had achieved a        WESTEBBE:     I would never think of it. I kept trying to get the&#13;
&#13;
remarkable recovery.     The Minister of Coordination and the governor of    Minister of Coordination to change the legislation to remove me from&#13;
&#13;
the Central Bank wanted somebody in there who could give objective           this position, which obviously could have been subject of sharp attack&#13;
&#13;
economic advice.                                                             by someone who wanted to say Why is this American this close to this&#13;
&#13;
     Greece had relatively few macroeconomists, and it had to be             government after so many years of freedom?    He told me once (he was a&#13;
&#13;
somebody who could operate this AID agency and who would not be              superb member of the center right-wing party), "I'm not going to&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        7                                                                             8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
change the legislation.    It would take me more trouble in parliament,   through my involvement with PL480, we could get the food free,&#13;
&#13;
and I've got other things on the agenda.    And by the way, I have no     completely outside the existing program.    So I organized a national&#13;
&#13;
problem, I trust you.     I said, "Well, as you know my purpose here is   program and presented it to the then Prime Minister.        He bought it&#13;
&#13;
to advise you on the decision not to veto it.    I will sign anything     enthusiastically.     The next day he gave a national speech endorsing&#13;
&#13;
you want, but I'll tell you whBt I think of it before I do."    It was    it. We put together a program with his Ministry of Education, with&#13;
&#13;
exactly that position which enabled me to get involved with a great       great difficulty by the way because bureaucrats were flatly opposed to&#13;
&#13;
many policy issues with which I think I might have made some              mixing feeding children with education. Bureaucrats did not like to&#13;
&#13;
difference.   At least I got my point of view heard.   They couldn't      hear that their schools were used to feed people.     They were supposed&#13;
&#13;
exclude it. I had to see the papers, I could therefore comment on         only to educate people. But we worked it out.     Three to four hundred&#13;
&#13;
them. I could see people and organize a consensus if I wanted toÂ·-one     thousand kids were being fed by the time I left Greece in 1966.           The&#13;
&#13;
way or another.                                                           people who opposed it, such as the director of general education,&#13;

     Another thing it did, because I was in a position of inventing       called me into his office a year after it was under way.          "You know I&#13;

reform, for economic policy and so forth.   It was quite appealing.            Anyway, from Greece I came looking for a job in '66.         The&#13;
&#13;
One of the things that Papendreau was interested in, having been a        political situation was getting poisonous, the king had thrown out the&#13;
&#13;
former minister of education in the '30s, was education.    A major       Papendreau government, a succession of governments were coming in&#13;

&#13;
were poor areas.   Nutritional levels were low, children were coming to   had been six years.     I had had to renew my contract every year after&#13;
&#13;
school hungry; they were not getting adequate diets.                      the first two years.     The Federal Reserve wanted me to come back. I&#13;

     Discussing this with a number of people in the non-governmental      had to make a decision, because they were not going to keep the job&#13;
&#13;
community and with others in the Greek establishment, I and others        open for me forever. It was for career reasons.&#13;
&#13;
thought it was time we did something about it.   I discovered that,            Maybe you would like me to say a word about the Fed job?           I can&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                          9                                                                               10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
quickly cover that.     From '56 through '60, I worked at the Federal         Before accepting this position, I was offered two options: to work on&#13;
&#13;
Reserve Board after doing my graduate work at Harvard.         I was in the   the India desk as assistant to Greg Votaw or to go in the Economics&#13;
&#13;
international division.     I worked on the Sterling Area, I was the          Department.     As an economist, I was persuaded by the argument that&#13;
&#13;
expert on foreign exchange markets, the UK economy, and various               economists should be in this new field of activity which was then&#13;
&#13;
associated other countries.     I !did economic analysis for the Board        being built up rapidly. I was essentially an advisor in the Economics&#13;
&#13;
reporting on current events and doing applied research. It was from           Department. I was supposed to be one of the several who were supposed&#13;
&#13;
that position (William McChesey Martin was Chairman) that he was asked        to lead missions for the operational departments on a wide geographic&#13;
&#13;
by the Governor of the Central Bank in Greece to find someone to fill         basis, learn about the world, be able to make intercountry&#13;
&#13;
the job I just described. I was the one he suggested with the idea I          comparisons, and contribute to the applied research of the department&#13;
&#13;
would stay two years and come back. As I said, it ended up as six             by writing about the experiences.        In the end I was the only one&#13;
&#13;
years.                                                                        appointed to this staff.&#13;

     I came to the Bank in '66, having explored the options for a             OLIVER:     This was what year?&#13;
&#13;
future career in private banking, the Fed or the World Bank. Frankly I        WESTEBBE:     This was '66.   Essentially it was the job I had, from '66&#13;
&#13;
felt upon examining all these things that it wasn't really a question         to '68, until Robert McNamara became President.        My first mission was&#13;
&#13;
of money.    Money was pretty much the same everywhere.       The issue was   to the Philippines in '66.        As a member of the mission for two weeks,&#13;
&#13;
really what you wanted to do.     I looked over the Bank and I said,          I kind of had to find my way in the Philippines until the mission&#13;

wanted to get into, so I joined the World Bank.                               WESTEBBE: No, I was always lent from the Economics Department.           This&#13;

     The mission was very serious.     We spent three months in one of           job right, you really had to just finish it.      You couldn't just keep&#13;

the more difficult places to live I have ever been in.           It was          going back and forth.&#13;

essentially a sandbox.     In those days it was 15,000 people, a capital              To make a long story short, this report was very much liked by&#13;

&#13;
        hoped (those of us on this mission) that this would be a guideline to             WESTEBBE:     A number of projects had been done.   We had done isolated,&#13;
&#13;
        the Bank on bow to lend to Mauritania, but the Bank knew virtually                individual projects in various countries.     We didn't know very much&#13;
&#13;
        nothing at this point, having only invested in the iron mine earlier.             about the economies.     We   had done economic reports on a number of&#13;

                An amusing anecdote occurred on the occasion when the government          WESTEBBE:    You mean this report?   This report was effectively&#13;

They did feeder roads for agriculture.     They did education in the         little work done on national economic policy dealing with&#13;
&#13;
early days.    No general economics work was done there.                     industralization.    During this period I remember, we had a debate in&#13;
&#13;
     My last job in the Economic's Department was a mission to Morocco       the Bank in which the Bank moved towards financing public industrial&#13;
&#13;
in '68. I headed the mission, I, went there three times. It was also a      development banks.     At one time we would only finance private ones&#13;
&#13;
mission designed to examine the case for further Bank lending,              with guarantees.     The Bank moved in the direction of recognizing the&#13;
&#13;
particularly to take a long look at the dams which had been built and        fact that the governments were going to have development banks and&#13;
&#13;
the economic policies that had been pursued.     That was a quick report,   they would hold majority shares or own them, and we had to still be&#13;
&#13;
the first and only one I and two other mission members I had written        involved.&#13;
&#13;
in 30 days, because it.had to be out in time for a consultative group.      OLIVER:     Yas this a direct contradiction to the Yoods' years?&#13;
&#13;
Unfortunately, the conclusion was sufficiently harsh about the              YESTEBBE:     I don't think so, I think it was more of a evolution.     He&#13;
&#13;
performance of the Moraccan government that they decided not to have        might have resisted if he had been there.      The point was we had to do&#13;
&#13;
the consultative group. I suspect they were right.                          something in this field. Industralization was clearly part of the&#13;
&#13;
     Then McNamara came in.     He essentially reorganized the Economics    development future of these countries, and we didn't know much about&#13;
&#13;
complex.    He reorganized it around issues that were of interest to        it.   In fact, when I think of what we are doing now compared with what&#13;
him. The three divisions that he created that were new were                 we were doing then, there is certainly a marked change. We are dealing&#13;
Urbanization, Industralization, and Population.     These were areas that   with such things as harmonizing effective protecti~n rates, exchange&#13;
earlier did not have a specific research focus.     Of course, some of      rates, basic shifts in interest rate policy, monetary policy and&#13;
the subjects had been covered by others.     Urbanization was a             capital markets.     But we'll come to that.   Our scope today is so much&#13;
particularly new area though.                                               wider.     It was essentially seen in those days as a way of supporting&#13;
OLIVER:     Just an aside on the Economics of Industralization Division.    project lending, but there were policy implications.&#13;
&#13;
Was this because IFC had really taken over the private industrial work               I was then appointed Chief of the Economics of Urbanization&#13;
&#13;
so that it was an attempt at public enterprise, or was it mixed up          Division. It was quite clear when you look at the shift in populations&#13;
&#13;
across the board?                                                           that there would be a) rapid urbanization in the Third World and b)&#13;

agriculture.    We were facing a massive demographic shift to which         the nation.    The whole question of secondary cities was raised.&#13;
&#13;
policy had to respond.    It was clear from the processes of development    Essentially, the question of defining the role of the urban economy in&#13;
&#13;
that a part would have to be in industry, if only to transform the          the national economy and the kind of planning, resource allocation,&#13;
&#13;
agriculture products that the country were capable of producing,            and resource mobilization issues this raised.     I think Bank lending&#13;
&#13;
adding more local value, replacing imports, and developing new forms        did very much follow this initial approach which we had outlined. A&#13;
&#13;
of exports.    We weren't thi~king of creating Switzerlands in Africa,      lot more work was done, with a good deal more depth. In summary, I&#13;
&#13;
but we certainly were thinking of an intermediate stage which Africa        think that was one of the most exciting things I did in the Bank.        It&#13;
&#13;
had not taken very many steps to reach at that stage.     They were still   was a brand new field.&#13;
&#13;
primarily export producers.     The problem did not concern only Africa.            One must say that it also awakened a considerable amount of&#13;

The economics of urbanization covered the world.     It's function was to   opposition from those who believed a good project was all you needed&#13;
&#13;
develop an analysis of the problem for the Bank as a whole, to define       and did not see that the context within which you did the project was&#13;
&#13;
the kinds of policy issues that were involved, and to indicate which        relevant.     It was very hard to sell this to straight projects people.&#13;
&#13;
options existed for lending.                                                Further, since the work had started in what was an Economics&#13;
&#13;
   Out of this work, which I did for two years, '68-'70, came what          Department, it awakened an enormous amount of bureaucratic resistance&#13;

staff weeks doing an agriculture section loan only to discover, what        services, the Cubans were there, and the Angolans had soldiers.           The&#13;
&#13;
we had repeatedly pointed out, that you couldn't launch an                  East Germans had built a beer brewery which used half the power&#13;
&#13;
agricultural sector loan when all the prices are distorted, when all        generated on the island and was losing money like mad.          A brick&#13;
&#13;
the markets are controlled by 'the government, and when the farmers         factory was doing the same.     A fishing company had boats too large to&#13;
&#13;
have no incentive to produce because they can't buy anything if you         catch the kind of fish available in local waters.         It was a disaster.&#13;
&#13;
don't have any foreign exchange.     Until you got the exchange rate                It took a long time to get a dialogue going with them.       Years ago&#13;
&#13;
right, you got the complimentary measures on the credit side, ~you          they even had refused to talk to us.     Finally they came to us and&#13;
&#13;
opened the economy up to get rid of the state stores, the sector loan       said, "We need a structural adjustment program.       We heard about it. We&#13;
&#13;
wouldn't work.     In due course another vice president would come in and   want to know what it is and how we can become eligible.          1 got&#13;
&#13;
cancel the sector loan, with all the losses that involved, the time         involved with putting this together.     Again, it was    one of the most&#13;
&#13;
invested.     We went to a SAL that is now working.   1 haven't followed    exciting things I've done, for the simple reason that again we faced a&#13;
&#13;
it in the last few months but at least it seems to be working. I've         case where the Fund said, as they had said in Guinea Bissau, "We can't&#13;
&#13;
heard exports have picked up by some multiple in the course of one          go into this place.     We don't have the staff,    and it is an adjustment&#13;
&#13;
year. Investment and agriculture is at a record high.     So many           problem, longer term, not a stabilization problem.       Why don't you take&#13;
&#13;
talented people have gone into private activities that government is        the lead? We'll support you with staff, but we're not going to push a&#13;
&#13;
having trouble recruiting civil servants.                                   standby operation to our board as there is no case for it, and the SAF&#13;
&#13;
     Another interesting case which 1 think illustrates the way             (structural adjustment facility) program has no conditionality.&#13;
&#13;
decisions are sometimes made in the Bank--sometimes they are right and      Therefore you do it."&#13;
&#13;
sometimes they are not .        . St. Tans was a similar case to Guinea             1 took two missions out, one preappraisal, one appraisal.         The&#13;
&#13;
Bissau.     It's an island off the West Coast of Gabon, which had           economy was basically organized around cocoa plantations which had&#13;
&#13;
followed the Marxist model to the point of having an economy in             produced something like 15 thousand tons in the last best year in the&#13;
&#13;
virtually total decline by 1986 when 1 first went there in the fall.        '70s.     Back in the '20s it was 25,000 tons.     It was now down to 4,000&#13;
&#13;
A little paradise, but a poor one as the president told me. Indeed          tons. It was still maintaining enormous numbers of state employees on&#13;
&#13;
half the population    were living on food aid from the world food          the nationalized plantations, most of whom were not producing anything-&#13;
&amp;#12;.Â·                                                            41                                                                              42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     -mostly clerks.   There was an overbloated central government borrowing        at the new rate of exchange thereby giving an incentive for the worse&#13;
&#13;
     from the central bank in order to cover bills. The exchange rate was           ones to reduce costs and the best ones to make higher profits. We&#13;
&#13;
     highly overvalued, everything was rationed, the stores were empty.        In   organized these plantations around foreign companies that were hired&#13;
&#13;
     short, so there was desperation in paradise.                                   to run them, although they still remain government owned.&#13;
&#13;
          Yhen we got there we   unders~ood   immediately that the problem was           A second phase would be government doing the redistribution of&#13;
&#13;
     somewhat like in Guinea Bissau.    If you were going to conduct a full         land no longer suitable for cocoa into food crops with an organize'd&#13;
&#13;
     reform, change the exchange rates, bring under control all the sources         system of extension work. That was exciting, because, for the first&#13;
&#13;
     of overvaluation, you had to bring goods into the economy. The                 time, we saw the Bank take on the entire panoply of macro reforms:&#13;
&#13;
     President told me before December of '86, wYes, I have Christmas               exchange rates, public finance, credit policy--all combined with&#13;
&#13;
     coming. You may not realize this, but this country is really not part          sector policies and projects.     Of course you can do this in a&#13;
&#13;
     of Africa. We have been under 450 years of Portuguese control and our          microcosm:     there are only a 100,000 people.   But it was an&#13;
&#13;
     consumption patterns are those of Portugal.      If I don't get $2,000,000     intellectually challenging exercise, which I gather is going&#13;
&#13;
     worth of cheese, wine and other food by December, I'm not going to             reasonably well.&#13;
&#13;
     survive." Indeed he had to get money to do that.                               OLIVER:     Should I ask you more questions?   Has anything not been asked&#13;
&#13;
          We appraised the operation last May.      To get the goods in the         that I should have asked?&#13;
&#13;
     market in time, we used an unused line of credit which hadn't been             WESTEBBE:     May I suggest that I think a little bit about that. I've&#13;
&#13;
     used for general repairs and maintenance. We made available a                  got to get back to the urgent matters of the day.      I think we have&#13;
&#13;
     $2,000,000 advance out of that credit to enable the government to              covered the main bases, but there may be some areas that I could maybe&#13;
&#13;
     place immediate orders for the goods.      When the SAL was passed with        say something additional worth preserving on the tape.&#13;
&#13;
     all the features I've discussed, it would pick up necessary financing.         OLIVER:     Well, if you think of any additional things, I hope you'll&#13;

     Our strategy included a cocoa project for which we had already started         let me know.     Thank you very much.&#13;

     Development Bank. Those three were launched at the same time. They&#13;

     were fully integrated.   We calculated the new rate of exchange at a&#13;

            In January 25, 1988, Richard Westebbe
            was interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives
            oral history program by Robert W. Oliver. During his tenure
            at the Bank from 1966 to 1991, Mr. Westebbe worked in the
            following areas: in the economics department as an advisor
            to the economics urbanization division (1966-1969); as
            division chief for the East-Central Delta Urban Region
            (ECDUR) (1969-1970); for the western Africa region as a
            senior economist (1971-1974, 1976-1987); in the
            international relations department as a team leader for the
            planning advisory division (1974-1976); and for the southern
            Africa region as a lead economist (1987-1990). He worked on
            missions to the Philippines, Mauritania, Gabon,
            Guinea-Bissau, and the Ivory Coast among others. He
            discusses how the World Bank was not doing program lending
            to Africa, and yet the economic reports were a basis of a
            dialogue with the countries on their policies. His
            transcript concerns the natural and industrial resources of
            Africa, mechanisms for mobilizing capital, and exchange
            rates contributing to the health of an economy.
