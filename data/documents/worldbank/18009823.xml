&#13;
                                                                              would probably stay in the Bank indefinitely.       Hy wife was an invalid,&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Hr. Sommers. I wonder if you would begin by telling a bit          which would have not gone well with big entertainment responsibilities&#13;
&#13;
about your own involvement in the Bank.                                       in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
SOMMERS:    I came to the Bank in November. 1946. as a member of the          OLIVER:    Or travelling abroad.&#13;
&#13;
legal staff.     I was later proaoted to Assistant General Counsel. and.      SOMMERS:    And most important, I had changed jobs all â&#128;¢Y life, every&#13;
&#13;
in 1949. when McCloy left for Germany taking with him the General             seven or eight years, and operated on the principle of the girl who&#13;
&#13;
Counsel. Black named me General Counsel of the Bank.       Later I was made   can't say no; and so I left.&#13;
&#13;
Vice President and General Counsel at the tiae when Bob Garner left to        OLIVER:     And when you left Hr. Broches became,,,,&#13;
&#13;
become head of IFC. Three vice presidents were named to succeed hia:          SOMMERS:     He becaae General   Counsel~   Later when McNamara came in. I&#13;
&#13;
Iliff. Knapp and myself.      I soon turned over most of the actual legal     had resigned but had soae contacts with him.        He asked me to give him&#13;
&#13;
work to Broches. who was Assistant General Counsel. and later gave up         IIY views. and he later caae up to New York and said. "When you retire&#13;
&#13;
the title   ~f   General Counsel because I really was not doing much in the   froa Equitable. will you coae down and work as an advisor -- first on&#13;
&#13;
legal field,      In the fall of '59. I vas approached by Equitable Life in   reorganization and later on other things?"        I was in that role in the&#13;
&#13;
New York. which was having a change in management. and asked to become        Bank for about ten years, Since then I have had only one official&#13;
&#13;
Senior Vice President and General Counsel. which 1 accepted. I later          contact and that is ss s meaber of the Pension Finance Committee.&#13;
&#13;
became Chairman of the Board.                                                 OLIVER:    Later in our conversation I would like to ask you about the&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Hay I just interject that this was a time when many people in     HcNsmara years. but I wonder if we could go back.into history earlier&#13;
&#13;
the Bank would have preferred that you stay in the Bank and possibly          than that to begin with.      Let me ask you how yOu got to know Hr. George&#13;
&#13;
.become President of the Bank itself.                                         Woods.     Maybe you would also say a bit about contrasts between the way&#13;
&#13;
SOMMERS:     Perhaps. but there were a number of reasons why I didn't think   that Hr. Black    operat~d   sod the way Hr. Woods operated at the Bank.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      3                                                                               4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOHHERS: I      ti~st   knew George Woods after I joined the Bank and when        he would   fiv~   out if we did come under the subpoena. because I didn't&#13;
&#13;
First Boston vas naâ&#128;¢ed a member of the first group of managers of the             want the iâ&#128;¢plication to arise that there was anything significant in&#13;
&#13;
Bank's underwriting syndicate.          I had several contacts in connection      it.   He said. "O.K. see my staff chief,''     did go over to see the staff&#13;
&#13;
with Bank lending operations paralleling public offerings by Bank                 chief and told him the story of this man's being hired with the result&#13;
&#13;
borrowers. and some contacts on Bank â&#128;¢ediation. on the origin of IDA,             that the subpoena was withdrawn. My only other connection with Dixon&#13;
&#13;
and so forth.         I also had something to do with Woods in connection with    Yates was to go down and hear George Woods' testimony.&#13;
&#13;
the Dixon-Yates problems.                                                         OLIVER:    Could you tell a little about that testimony?&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Maybe you would tell a little about that story?                        SOMMERS:    I can't remember the details of it. but -- do you want that&#13;
&#13;
SOMMERS:    Well, the Bank had hired an engineer, Adolf Wenzel. at the            joke that I told you?&#13;
&#13;
suggestion of George Woods.          Wenzel turned out to be a target of          OLIVER:    Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Senator Kefauver's attack on the Dixon-Yates issue in which First                 SOHHERS:    George Woods was asked about some man, maybe the. same&#13;
&#13;
Boston was accused of so.ething like conflict of interest. as I                   engineer. being a vice president indicating he was a very important&#13;
&#13;
remember it.       I was involved because the Bank was served with a              figure in First Boston. and George said, "Oh we have about 45 vice&#13;
&#13;
subpoena to produce documents to the Kefauver           C~ittee.   and this       presidents."      He was asked â&#128;¢"Why do you have so many?"     And George said.&#13;
&#13;
presented a considerable problem because the Articles of Agreement of             "It makes them feel good,"&#13;
&#13;
the Bank make it clear that it is not subject to subpoenas or                     OLIVER: I hope it got a ripple of laughter.&#13;
&#13;
requirements     ~o     produce documents.   On the contrary. they are            SOMMERS:    It did get a ripple of laughter.&#13;
&#13;
confidential.         On the other hand. we didn't want the Bank to become a      OLIVER:    Did you also know George Woods in connection with some of the&#13;
&#13;
target of the Kefauver investigation. because charges were made that              overseas controversies that the Bank was engaged in helping to settle?&#13;
&#13;
when   We~zel   had become involved in Kefauver's suspicions. George Woods        SOMMERS:    I knew him, but the ones that George Woods was actively&#13;
&#13;
had pushed him off on his friend Gene Black and the Bank was providing            engaged in were not the ones that I was actively engaged in, at least&#13;
&#13;
cover for him. which wasn't at all true.           Woods had recommended him as   in the same parts.      He was engaged in the Suez settlement; I was&#13;
&#13;
an expert engineer, which he was.            So I went to Kefauver and told him   engaged in the Anglo-Egyptian financial settlement.          He was engaged in&#13;
&#13;
that as a matter of principle the Bank was not going to honor his                 finding people to act as funders for the Indus settlement; I was&#13;
&#13;
subpoena, but that I would be prepared to tell him off the record what            involved.i~    the bringing the Bank into the act and getting the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 5                                                                           6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
negotiations going in the earlier stages.       I knew George Woods in those   element in making that choice.    He was a person who had a major role in&#13;
&#13;
capacities, but I didn't work with him at that stage,                          bringing the Bank into the American â&#128;¢arket and subsequently other&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     What was it about George Woods that was particularly               markets as a reputable borrower, and that was still an important role&#13;
&#13;
impressive and caused him to be in the forefront of the kinds of               for the Bank President even at the end of Black's regime when the&#13;
&#13;
activities engaged in by First Boston.                                         Bank's credit rating was pretty well established.&#13;
&#13;
SOHHERS:    George Woods was known, perhaps. as a leading figure. if not       OLIVER:    Would you care to contrast the personalities of Hr. Black and&#13;
&#13;
th~   leading figure, in the Wall Street investment banking community --       Hr. Woods and aaybe say something about their operating styles as&#13;
&#13;
as somebody who was extremely canny and without sa.e of the stuffiness         PreSident of the Bank1&#13;
&#13;
that usually goes along with prestigious roles there: and was                  SOHHERS:    I don't find that easy.   Black came in at a time when&#13;
&#13;
interested in sa.etbing outside of his close knit Wall Street sphere of        establiahing the Bank's position as a credit-worthy borrower was stillâ&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
activity.     He vas also obviously a first-rate negotiator and soaeone        not coapletely achieved.    He also came in at a time when relationships&#13;
&#13;
who knew the financial â&#128;¢arket, particularly the Aaerican â&#128;¢arket. aa            with the U. S. Govern.ent were still touchy.    He also came in at a time&#13;
&#13;
well as anybody else.      And he had a very able group of people with hiâ&#128;¢     when the Bank had barely made its first development loan and at a time&#13;
&#13;
in First Boston.                                                               when the legal barriers to"investors' buying the Bank bonds had not all&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Can you add anything as to why he was chosen as                    been disposed of.    He also was involveU in very important mediation&#13;
&#13;
President of the Bank succeeding Hr. Black?                                    efforts in connection with the Suez problem, the Anglo Egyptian&#13;
&#13;
SOMMERS~     We~l.   I think you have to go back to the Bank's original        financial settleaent after the '"67 Incident" (as I learned to call&#13;
&#13;
dealing with investaent bankers.      There was a period of experimentation    it), the Indus Basin agreement, and things of that kind.     All of those&#13;
&#13;
with how the Bank should issue bonds. It was only after two or three           interested him much more than lending operations as such, and he left&#13;
&#13;
other ,efforts that the Bank went into a conventional underwriting-            routine lending operations pretty much in the hands of Garner.       Black&#13;
&#13;
syndicate-with-managers technique.       It chose Horgan Stanley and First     said, "I am not a policy man, I am a deal man,"&#13;
&#13;
Boston as the sole managers to begin with.       Because of some belief that        When Woods came in the problems were different and the&#13;
&#13;
the Horgan name was less acceptable in washington than First Boston.           personalities were somewhat different. Also their experiences.       Black&#13;
&#13;
t'irst Boston was given the rather leading position to begin with. and         had been essentially a bond salesman, rather than a completely rounded&#13;
&#13;
George Woods was a very intluential                                            investment banker. He had been connected with a commercial bank mostly&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                                                 8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
rather than an investment bank.   I would have said that in many ways       Black's relationship, even with Board members who disagreed with him&#13;
&#13;
their personalities were similar and that they got along very well with     because they thought he was too conservative. was always very warm.&#13;
&#13;
each other, because Woods was obviously somebody that Black was             OLIVER:    It has been suggested by others that on occasion Hr. Woods&#13;
&#13;
instrumental in choosing.   He was the person who appointed Woods           might tend to be a bit sharp in his language and in that sense might&#13;
&#13;
to all these jobs that Woods undertook for the Bank before he became        have been rather â&#128;¢ore like Hr. Garner, who I also have heard could be a&#13;
&#13;
President.                                                                  bit sharp.&#13;
&#13;
     I didn't see Woods in operation. so I can't personally say how his     SOHHERS:     I don't think the Garner analogy is a good one.        Garner, I&#13;
&#13;
personality and relationship with staff differed from Black's.      But I   should say as a preliâ&#128;¢inary, aade a â&#128;¢ajor contribution to the Bank by&#13;
can say this: Black had a remarkable ability to get along with people       being very tough â&#128;¢inded to begin with.        He was very much more&#13;
even when he was saying "No" to them.    A borrowers' representative once   conservative than George Woods. For instance Garner would say, "Why&#13;
&#13;
said he would rather be said "No'" to by Black than ''Yes" to by Bob        should such and such a country have a water supply system in its town?&#13;
&#13;
Garner.   The staff was devoted to Black, because he symbolized the         When I was   b~ought   up in Mississippi    [o~ whereve~   it was), we didn't&#13;
&#13;
rebirth of the Bank after the inter- regnum following Eugene Heyer's        have any water in our     house.~   Things like that. That was not the&#13;
&#13;
resignation. By and large, they thought he was a wara and understanding     George Woods technique at all.&#13;
&#13;
person who had very close relations with most of them. He used to play            George Woods had a sort of      sa~dooic   manner. which I believe he&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
     Hy impression is that Woods' relationship with the Bank staff was      people who came from a different background       o~   a different environment&#13;
&#13;
less easy to begin with because -- at least as I have heard said, I         than the New York financial cam.unity.        An example of the Woods humor&#13;
&#13;
can't say on my own first hand knowledge      he treated Vice President     which conceivably could be misunderstood was one time when I&#13;
&#13;
Burke Knapp somewhat roughly. This would have an effect on other staff.     was negotiating with George Woods about First Boston's commission in an&#13;

because Knapp was a very trusted figure in the Bank.     It may have been   offering of some European Governsent's bonds,          It was a so-called&#13;

that Woods was doing this primarily because he thought Knapp was so         parallel offering with a World Bank loan to the same government and in&#13;

powerful he had to be. in effect. put in his place.     If that was the     which the World Bank, as it frequently offe~ed tb d~ in those days. had&#13;

&#13;
Boston was not an underwriter, because it was not taking any                  of the major achievements.      What are some of the aspirations that&#13;

underwriting risks, and that it should not have an underwriter's              George Woods hiâ&#128;¢self had for the Bank?&#13;

was the real nature of t.he problems that may have arisen after I left,       it increased enoraously.       To a great eKtent, of course. this was&#13;

I can't say.                                                                  soaevhat inevitable.      When the Bank started, people in the West didn't&#13;

&#13;
But I also think Black's feelings were hurt by some things that George        a greatly â&#128;¢ore expert and representative Bank staff. and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
Woods did, such as, minor as it seeas, changing the Bank's travel                  However, Woods made a number of important policy changes --&#13;
&#13;
agency arrangeaents from American Express to Cooke.     This hurt Black       perhaps not announced as such. but changes in attitude, away from the&#13;
&#13;
because he was a Director of Aaerican Express.    Whether it was              somewhat excessive conservatism that the Bank went in for in the early&#13;
&#13;
something 11.ore than that, I can't say.   I was not close enough to          days -- rightly, as I believe.       I know about these in general because.&#13;

Garner days    were much too narrow.     For example. as I remeâ&#128;¢ber it. the     the Fund should have separate pension plans, should have separate&#13;

&#13;
these other international organizations. particularly the ones that had              Over the years, on the operational level that has improved greatly&#13;
&#13;
strong technical staffs.      That was one of the things that George Woods      particularly between the staffs.   I can't say how much if any of the&#13;
&#13;
undertook at an early stage.       At that stage, it looked better than it      improvement   can be attributed to George Woods.   On the administrative&#13;

OLIVER:    While you are on that subject of relations with other                treated in aany respects pdrtly because it didn't grow as rapidly in&#13;
&#13;
international organizations (we can come back in a moment to your               size and partly because the Europeans Tegarded the Fund as more their&#13;
&#13;
elaboration of other achieveaenta). aight I just ask about relations            organization and the Bank as a US organization, and because they&#13;
&#13;
with the    lnt~rnational   Monetary Fund?   I 811 aware of the fact that Hr.   regarded the Fund as an asset and the Bank as a liability.&#13;
&#13;
Woods asked Irving Friedman to come to the Bank from the International          OLIVER:   You were talking about some of the major achievements&#13;
&#13;
Monetary Fund in 1964 and this resulted in a great deal more                    changes that were for the better in the World Bank that occurred during&#13;
&#13;
interaction between the two.       Was that a positive achieveaent do you       the George Woods years in the Bank.   I interrupted you.   You were&#13;

SOHHERS:     I can't say, because I wasn't there.     I do think a very valid   SOMMERS: Well. I think a aajor Woods plus was getting IDA launched at a&#13;
&#13;
criticism of the Bank aanageaent applicable mostly to Garner in the             significant level.   He was not involved in the cÂ·tea~ion of IDA or&#13;
&#13;
early days was to keep the Fund at a distance.        ThisÂ·was particularly     getting it started or in the for.ing of the original concept, but.&#13;
true in administrative matters.       It was ridiculous that the Bank and       under his. regime, the replenishment that took place in the late or mid-&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   13                                                                             14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
'bOs was a difficult negotiation; but I wasn't involved in it. and                because I didn't think the Bank's influence on India's macroeconomic&#13;
&#13;
you could get better sources of      info~ation   on that.                        policy would be very effective.     I thought Nehru was primarily governed&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     You did tell a story earlier about George Woods' initial              by political considerations. rather than economic. The Bank got John&#13;
&#13;
reaction to IDA when you talked to hia once in New York.                          DeLattre to take on that role, and I think the results confirâ&#128;¢ my&#13;
&#13;
SOMMERS:    Well, that vas another ezaaple of George Woods' hu.or that            decision not to take it on.     I would certainly nor have wan'ted the Bank&#13;
&#13;
aight have been misunderstood.       I was given the assignment by Black of       to get involve in reca.mending currency valuation adjustments on which&#13;
&#13;
going to New York and talking to our leading syndicate â&#128;¢anagers about             it was not expert. a subject I thought was not really its turf.&#13;
&#13;
IDA, because Black was afraid that their initial reaction â&#128;¢ight be the                  Coming to Europe in answer to your question, Woods asked me to go&#13;
&#13;
same as his would have been before he beca.e an IDA advocate. na.ely              to Europe to see if Europe -- Western Europe. the     public and private&#13;
&#13;
that this "soft-lending" was not a reputable activity for any respectable         comm.uni ty   would support the organization of an international&#13;
&#13;
lending institution.       I went to Woods whose reaction had been the same,      counterpart of the British Overseas Development Institute, then headed&#13;
&#13;
but when I said to him, "George, if you were a        banker who had two          by Willia. Clark.     I did that and caae home and recommended against&#13;
&#13;
branches, one of which was making regular loans on the basis of                   it, because I thought a domestic organization would be much more&#13;
&#13;
creditworthiness and the other of which had in effect grant money that            influential with the U. S. Government and the U. S. business community&#13;
&#13;
you could make available to borrowers that were in trouble, don't you             and public opinion.    George did not like â&#128;¢Y recommendation.   Except for&#13;
&#13;
think that would improve the quality of your regular loans?"            He said   those two matters. I didn't have anything much to do with him during&#13;
&#13;
in effect    ~I   certainly do, and I am now an IDA supporter."                   the rest of his regime.    So from my personal point of view, there was&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     That's marvelous.    Was George woodsâ&#128;¢ presidency an even             this kind of a change, but whether that parallels something that was&#13;
&#13;
presidency over the five years, or was there a noticeable change about            going on in the rest of the Bank, I can't say.&#13;
&#13;
half-w~y    through?                                                              OLIVER:   Let me ask you a very general question.    I'm not sure if there&#13;
&#13;
SOMMERS:     I can't answer that.    At some stage in the Woods presidency,       is any easy answer to this.    On the face of it one might suppose that&#13;
&#13;
he asked me to be his representative on an India economic relationship            New York investment banking coa.unity is not a likely place to find&#13;

&#13;
didn't want to leave the Equitable where I was very busy and partly               Woods was very anxious to see the Bank succeed and was genuinely&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               15                                                                           lb&#13;

&#13;
SOMMERS:    No. I think this happened to Gene Black. and to all of us.      of the Bank when he was, they would have done many. if not most, of the&#13;
&#13;
Our vision of what was possible grev as our vision of what the reality      aaâ&#128;¢e things -- perhaps not at quite such s fast pace.     HcNa.ara. for&#13;

in a way this disadvantage of local Wall Streetism was joined by the        exa.ple. the Bank -- this is probably due in part to Hollis Chenery who&#13;

OLIVER:       You mentioned education and agriculture as major new thrusts            under HcNaaara, was in the increasingly representative character of the&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
agriculture lending really began in the George Woods days.              George        I think under Woods non-Americans got more and more positions.         A&#13;

Woods himself thought of the Bank as having becoee a developaent                      beginning was made on getting people from developing countries, and&#13;

institution rather more than a bank by '66 and '67.                                   that vas increased and eztended by McNamara.    W~en   always have been&#13;
&#13;
SOfot!:ERS:      think that is true.      I always thought that the argu.ent          under-represented on the Bank staff, and McNaaara made a big effort in&#13;
&#13;
about whether it vas a bank or a development institution was confusing.               that area.     I think some beginnings of that were made under Woods too.&#13;

Obviously it vas both and should be.             Nevertheless. the ten. did                I think under Woods the Bank staft not only became more&#13;
&#13;
protect against the idea that the Bank should act like the private                    representative but much more expert.     It was partly because ezpertise&#13;

marker, whicp nobody really believed who was connected with the Bank.                 in development work vas beco.ing â&#128;¢ore widespread.      When the Bank&#13;
&#13;
If it had acted like the         p~ivate ma~ket.     there would have been no         started, there were practically no development economists.      There were&#13;
&#13;
justification for its existence.           But Woods did beca.e leas restrictive      very few engineers or technicians who had experience in developing&#13;

about , lending policies. and agriculture as opposed to irrigation was                countries, except in colonial bureaucracies.     Later on the Bank was&#13;
&#13;
one respect. I don't remember about education. I don't remember about                 able to recruit people of that kind.     I think it was under Woods that&#13;
&#13;
housing -- when all that came in.              In these respects, as in almost        the Young Professional program developed, although I believe it was&#13;
&#13;
everything connected with the Bank, it's not easy to say "'This began                 started under Black.&#13;
&#13;
he-re precisely."        It was a gradual evolution as the needs of the Bank          OLIVER:    Hay I just comaent in passing that the early Woods years were&#13;
&#13;
and the needs of the        vo~ld   evolved.                                          the years. when economists themselves were gradually acknowledging that&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                          19                                                                               20&#13;

various kinds of activities that made human beings wiser or stronger           capitol aay be very much resented by the local people.           There â&#128;¢ay be&#13;
&#13;
were invest.ent kinds of activities. Gradually they began to perceive          difficulties in trying to get coordination from the whole group of&#13;
&#13;
that education ia inatru.ental in     develo~nt,    and then better drinking   bureaucracies in a developing country -- some central. aoae local --&#13;

&#13;
long tiae for the econa.ica profession to coae around to perceive that.        of the phr-es "Basic Huaan Needs" and "Absolute Poverty" which led the&#13;
&#13;
SOMMERS:     Yea. I agree with that. but at the a ..e tiae, aa the             Bank. and aoae of ita critics to say, "'Well, the Banlc.'a housing projects&#13;
&#13;
econa.ica profession began to perceive the iaportance of all those             are not dealing with the poorest of the poor."        Mostly they weren't.&#13;
&#13;
activities -- urban develop.ent and education -- the tendency grew in          because the poorest of the poor are not easy to work with in housing&#13;
&#13;
the international field as it had in the do.eatic field to isnore the          projects. as the United States housing progr.. s of the thirties&#13;
&#13;
political and social difficulties involved.      Under the HcNaaara regi.e.    deaonatrated pretty clearly, particularly if you want to have your&#13;
&#13;
the Bank eabraced this concept of basic buaan needs. a very legiti .. te       housing and urban services projects replicable, as the Bank's phrase&#13;
&#13;
concept.     But the papers on this subject would usually start with           is.   You've got to deal with people who have an incentive and self-&#13;
&#13;
saying:     "Of course social and political considerations aust be taken       interest in asking a big co6tribution of their own.&#13;
&#13;
into account.u and then     ~enty-five   pages would go on in econoaics.             Also the Bank. vas not aware of   th~Â·fact   that you can't give people&#13;
&#13;
       In the urban development field. a young friend of my son baa been       services that are lover than their expectancies even though they are&#13;
hired by the    ~ank   to go down and live in some of the Bank's urban         considerably higher than their experience.         In some cases where the&#13;

activities look fro. that perspective.      Soae of the innocence of the       central water taps every few blocks. every block or so, for people who&#13;
&#13;
Bank   i~   approaching these projects as reported by hia is really rather     had had no water before. the Bank was surprised to see that people&#13;

the subject.                                                                   OLIVER:   Well. then, to be the Devil'a Advocate just for a m0111ent:          To&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:      Can you illustrate the Bank's innocence?                          discover this presuaably has required additional Â·.~e;sonnel, or at least&#13;
&#13;
SOMMERS:      To start a housing project and ignore the difficulties.          an increase in learning by the existing personnel of the Bank.          In a&#13;
&#13;
Having to â&#128;¢ove a whole group of families off a place where they have           sense that runs contrary to what I understood to be the earlier&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                           21                                                                              22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
suggestion that aaybe the Bank has srown larger than it really needed            have known these things in advance. and I think to a certain extent&#13;
&#13;
to be. or that it has atteapted to find out aore. sort of knowins                that   is true.    But I like tbe idea that they feel they are learning aa&#13;
&#13;
everything about all developaent phases.                                         they are going along.      I think that is very healthy. and I think it ia&#13;
&#13;
SOMMERS:    No. I think there are two separate questions.       One is the       very healthy to have the lending operations and the appraisal process&#13;
&#13;
size of the Bank.    Hore staff doesn't necessarily .ean aore expertize:         be in effect a dialogue rather than a aeries of dictates by people in&#13;
&#13;
it can aean aore bureaucratic layerins.        I think the Bank suffers now.     Waahinston.       I think the Bank is trying to do that. and I hope that it&#13;
&#13;
not only fro. the size it has achieved in staff. but also from the               will continue to do so.&#13;
&#13;
speed at which it arew to that size          particularly i f you tben reach a            There is one part of the Bank we haven't â&#128;¢entioned. I don't know&#13;
&#13;
level where you have to cut off and that aeana that people can no                the Wooda' role in it.      That is the IFC.   At one point. whether it was&#13;
&#13;
longer look forward to proaotion and so forth.        I don't profess to know    under Woods or HcN-.ara. a change vas â&#128;¢ade.      When Bob Garner stopped&#13;
&#13;
what is the ideal size.        Particularly in the reala of econoaic             beins President of what was then called the IFC and Hartin Rosen took&#13;
&#13;
research. it could have aotten along with far less internal research             over (you . .y know that date). Rosen persuaded the President of the&#13;
&#13;
and auch â&#128;¢ore farming out -- brinsing people in for a year or two. and           Bank to let hia and fPC get out of the business of what I might call&#13;
&#13;
so forth.    I think the Bank generally has had far too aany econoaists.         the wholesale financins of. private enterprises in developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
and probably still baa.                                                                 The work of the Developaent Finadte Division was originally&#13;
&#13;
     Apart froa size. there is an issue of what is soaetimes called              operated by IFC even thouah it aight result in a Bank loan. Rosen got&#13;
&#13;
arrogance.    ,This doeanâ&#128;¢ t apply only to the Bank. There is an inherent        rid of that. partly I think becauae be wanted aore independence from&#13;
&#13;
arrogance in lendins or givins away money.        It doesn't aake any            the â&#128;¢sank bureaucracyâ&#128;¢.      I always tbouabt that was a aistake. I thought&#13;
&#13;
difference whether it's a World Bank official or a Ford Foundation               IFC and tbe Bank should be â&#128;¢ore closely related. and I thought that the&#13;
&#13;
offici~!.    or Consresaaan.     They often feel they know better what the       concept of IFC. if it was restricted to aakins investments at retail&#13;
&#13;
borrower or grantee needs than the borrower or srantee does. and aaybe           from Washinston. was auch narrower than it would be if it also had this&#13;
&#13;
that's true in soae cases.        But they should listen before they decide.     wholesaling function.      Perhaps under the present regiae of Bill Ryrie&#13;
&#13;
     I think. that in the urban developaent area that I aentioned. the           that will change: but at least during the HcN. .~ra regime. IFC did not&#13;
&#13;
Bank staff is to be praised for putting out a report on these issues             rank veryÂ·high in the Bank priorities. Proaotion of private enterprise&#13;
&#13;
called .. Learning by Doing."      Hany people â&#128;¢ight say that the Bank should    did not .rpnk very high. and I think if the DFC operation had been in&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC and if the IFC Executive Vice President had had the title&#13;
&#13;
originally conceived of as President of IFC, it would have given a&#13;
&#13;
soâ&#128;¢ewhat different balance to the Bank Group's efforts.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    I understand that Mr. Wood8 asked Mr. Rosen aa Executive Vice&#13;
&#13;
President of IFC to sit in on the aeetinga of the Presidential Council,&#13;
&#13;
which implied. I take it. that the head of IFC vas     rega~ded   aa being on&#13;
&#13;
the level of the other vice presidents in the total World Bank&#13;
&#13;
operation.&#13;
&#13;
SOHHERS:     This is true.   But IFC gradually becaae a â&#128;¢ore separate&#13;
&#13;
operation. and you hear the IFC people saying they don't want to get&#13;
&#13;
involved with all that red tape and paper work and layers of review.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Before I atop the tape â&#128;¢â&#128;¢Y I officially thank you very â&#128;¢ucb&#13;
&#13;
for the ti.e you have given to this project today. We will certainly&#13;
&#13;
look forward to seeing the typescript.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In July 1985, Davidson Sommers was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Robert W. Oliver. During his tenure at
            the Bank from 1946 to 1959, Mr. Sommers worked in the
            following areas: in the law department as a lawyer and also
            as assistant general counsel starting in 1946; as general
            counsel (1949-1959); and as vice president for the
            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD
            and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) (1956-1959).
            His transcript concerns the issuance of bonds and other
            legal barriers approached by the World Bank, the growing
            independence of the International Finance Corporation (IFC),
            and the presidencies of John McCloy and Eugene Black
