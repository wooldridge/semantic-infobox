 Note 1 Organization&#13;
         -&#13;
&#13;
The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the Centre) was established on&#13;
 October 14, 1966 to provide facilities for the conciliation and arbitration of investment disputes&#13;
between States and nationals of other States. On February 13, 1967,the International Bank for&#13;
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and the Centre entered intoAdministrative Arrange-&#13;
ments which were effective as of the date of the establishment of the Centre.The Memorandum of&#13;
Administrative Arrangements (the Memorandum) provides that, except to the extent that the Cen-&#13;
tre may b e reimbursed by the parties to proceedings for fees and expenses of members of Con-&#13;
ciliation Commissions,Arbitral Tribunals or ad hoc Committees,the Bank shall provide facilities&#13;
and services to the Centre, as described inNotes 2 and 3.&#13;
&#13;
Note 2  -Summary      of Significant Accounting Policies&#13;
&#13;
Basis of Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation: The financial statements have&#13;
been preparedinaccordance with generally accepted accountingprinciples inthe United States&#13;
and with InternationalAccounting Standards. Such financial statements are presented in accor-&#13;
dance with Statement of FinancialAccounting Standard No. 117,"Financial StatementsofNot-For-&#13;
Profit-Organizations" (SFAS No. 117). SFAS No. 117 requires that net assets are classified in&#13;
accordance with donor restrictions;however,there are no net assets as ofJune 30,2000 and 1999.&#13;
&#13;
Use of Estimates: The preparationof financial statements inconformity with generally accepted&#13;
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the&#13;
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the&#13;
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during&#13;
the reportingperiod.Actual results could differ from these estimates.&#13;
&#13;
Cash Equivalents: The Centre considers all highlyliquid debt investments purchased with an&#13;
original maturity of three months or less to b e cash equivalents.&#13;
&#13;
Value of services provided by the Bank and in-kind contributions: Inaccordance with State-&#13;
ment of FinancialAccounting Standard No. 116, "Accounting for Contributions Received and Con-&#13;
fributions Made", the value of services providedby the Bankis determined by the estimated fair&#13;
value of these services and is recorded by the Centre as in-kindcontributions and also as ex-&#13;
penses of the Centre.&#13;

own.The Centre's direct expenses attributable to arbitration proceedings are borne by the par-&#13;
ties in accordance with the Centre's Administrative and Financial Regulations (Regulations). In&#13;
accordance with these Regulations,the Secretary-General calls on the parties to make advance&#13;
deposits with the Centre from time to time to defray these anticipated expenses.Accordingly, the&#13;
Centre recognizes revenues from these exchange transactions duringthe period of and to the&#13;
extent of expenses incurred relatedto arbitration proceedings. If,after the completion of an arbi-&#13;
tration proceeding,it is determined that there is a cash surplus, such surplus shall be refundedto&#13;
the parties inproportion to the amounts advanced by each party to the Centre.&#13;

&#13;
To International Centre for Settlement&#13;
     of Investment Disputes&#13;
&#13;
We have auditedthe accompanying statements of financial position of the InternationalCentre for&#13;
Settlement of Investment Disputes (the Centre) as ofJune 30,2000and 1999,andthe relatedstate-&#13;
ments of activities and cash flows for the years then ended.These financial statements are the re-&#13;
sponsibility of the management of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&#13;
(IBRD) and of the Centre. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements&#13;
based on our audits.&#13;
&#13;
We conductedour audits inaccordance with generally accepted auditing standards inthe United&#13;
States of America and with the International Standards onAuditing. Those standards require that&#13;
we plan and performthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial state-&#13;
ments are free of material misstatement,An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence&#13;
supportingthe amounts and disclosures inthe financial statements.An audit also includes assess-&#13;
ingthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as&#13;
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.We believe that our audits provide a rea-&#13;
sonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
&#13;
Inour opinion,such financial statementspresent fairly, inall materialrespects,the financialposi-&#13;
tion ofthe InternationalCentre for Settlement of InvestmentDisputes as ofJune 30,2000and 1999,&#13;
andthe change inits net assets and cash flows for the years then ended inconformity with gener-&#13;
ally accepted accounting principles inthe United States of America and with International Ac-&#13;
counting Standards.&#13;

            International Center Settlement
            Investment Disputes (ICSID) growth in the caseload reflects
            the proliferation of investment laws and treaties with
            provisions setting forth advance general consents on the
            part of the States concerned to submit covered investment
            disputes to ICSID arbitration. Another highlight of the
            fiscal year 2000 was ICSID's administration of the
            proceedings in the Southern Bluefin Tuna Case, two new
            releases for the Centre's collection of Investment Laws
            of the World was published, and another release for the
            collection of Investment Treaties was issued. The center
            continued to be active in responding to requests from
            governments, investors, and other World Bank Group units for
            information and advice on foreign investment law and
            arbitration law.  ICSID staff also gave presentations on the
            work of the Centre at ten international conferences and
            training events.
