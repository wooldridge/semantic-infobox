The CDRF provides a systematic approach               through an in-depth exploration of the outcomes&#13;
for development practitioners to review their         of capacity development interventions, to gain a&#13;

monitoring and evaluating capacity development&#13;
outcomes are compatible with the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s current&#13;
project cycle and can help to assure quality during&#13;

             changes in targeted institutional capacity                   in terms of a clear capacity development&#13;

&#13;
Reviewing project documents for capacity&#13;
development interventions provides an important&#13;
lesson for practitioners about the importance&#13;
of building in an intact results chain for project&#13;
design, implementation and evaluation. Whereas&#13;
many current project documents require reviewers&#13;
to piece together a capacity development change&#13;
story by searching for potential intermediate&#13;
outcomes measures and associated indicators&#13;
of institutional capacity characteristics, newly&#13;
developed or revised results frameworks could&#13;
present clearer sequences of outcome measures&#13;
for each capacity development objective.&#13;
Conducting a project review using the CDRF is&#13;
therefore useful not only for understanding the&#13;
results of previous Bank operations but also for&#13;
developing a stronger results orientation for&#13;
capacity development initiatives going forward.&#13;

comprises formal and informal political, economic           characteristics listed below contribute to the&#13;
and social forces that determine the priority that          strength of stakeholder ownership.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Institutional Characteristics                                     Areas Covered&#13;
 Commitment of social and        Social and political leaders consistently and regularly support the development&#13;
 political leaders               goal through public statements, decisions, votes, and other actions&#13;
                                 demonstrating their commitment and accountability for achievement of the goal.&#13;
                                 Leaders demonstrate sound ethics and integrity related to the goal, faithfully&#13;
                                 honoring their pledges of support and not engaging in activities or missions that&#13;
                                 would undermine progress toward the goal.&#13;
&#13;
 Compatibility of social norms   The social norms and widespread beliefs that shape the behavior of local&#13;
 and values                      stakeholders are compatible with the development goal.&#13;
&#13;
 Stakeholder participation in    Priority-setting processes related to the development goal include opportunities&#13;
 setting priorities              for all stakeholders to express opinions freely and without fear of repression,&#13;
                                 and these opportunities are communicated with adequate time for stakeholder&#13;
                                 engagement and response. Stakeholders actively participate through these&#13;
                                 established mechanisms, and government and other public service entities are&#13;
                                 responsive to the expressed views of civil society and other relevant parties.&#13;
&#13;
 Stakeholder demand for          Stakeholders know their rights related to the development goal, claim those&#13;
 accountability                  rights, and communicate their grievances and proposals for change to the&#13;
                                 government and legislature. If public officials and other public service providers&#13;
                                 fail to meet expectations about the achievement of the goal or are using&#13;
                                 allocated resources for unintended purposes, stakeholders freely hold them&#13;
                                 accountable for their conduct and performance. Stakeholders organize and&#13;
                                 collectively appeal unfavorable decisions concerning the goal. Stakeholders&#13;
                                 demand and use instruments of accountability that are available to the public,&#13;
                                 such as government scorecard information.&#13;
&#13;
 Transparency of information     Government and other public service entities provide accurate, relevant,&#13;
 to stakeholders                 verifiable, and timely information about the development goal to all stakeholders.&#13;
                                 They also explain actions concerning the goal in terms that stakeholders can use&#13;
                                 to participate in setting priorities, monitoring progress, and evaluating actions&#13;
                                 of public officials responsible for the goal. Any information influencing decisions&#13;
                                 related to the goal is fully disclosed to stakeholders.&#13;

            Clarity in defining rights and   The rights and responsibilities of stakeholders related to the development&#13;
            responsibilities                 goal are clearly defined and communicated. Stakeholders share a common&#13;
                                             understanding of the policy goal and the targets of any specified regulations. The&#13;
                                             authorities and processes concerning the policy instrument are clearly identified&#13;
                                             and communicated to stakeholders. Stakeholders understand the objectives,&#13;
                                             rights and responsibilities prescribed by the policy instrument.&#13;

                                             by the policy instrument related to the goal do not conflict with those for other&#13;
                                             goals.&#13;
            Legitimacy                       Policy instrument is formulated based on an informed, transparent, participatory,&#13;
                                             and deliberate process. The instrument conforms to recognized principles and&#13;
                                             standards and is perceived as desirable and appropriate within the local system&#13;
                                             of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions. Stakeholders and unaffiliated expert&#13;
                                             reviewers perceive the actions and sanctions prescribed by the policy as fair.&#13;
                                             Stakeholdersâ&#128;&#153; rights to appeal are assured by the policy instrument.&#13;
            Incentives for compliance        Policy instrument facilitates desired economic and social exchange activities&#13;
                                             related to the development goal, minimizes uncertainty, time, information and&#13;
                                             other costs to participants in these transactions, and provides sanctions for&#13;
                                             non-compliance. Possible measures include: share of targeted stakeholders who&#13;
                                             elect self-policing, self-auditing, or self-disclosure options provided by the policy&#13;
                                             instrument; share of targeted stakeholders who comply with provisions of the&#13;
                                             policy instrument.&#13;
            Ease of administration           Policy instrument is administratively easy for the regulatory or governing body&#13;
                                             to implement. Implementation incurs only those administrative costs required to&#13;
                                             achieve the intended policy outcomes related to the goal. Administrative tasks&#13;
                                             are defined and allocated with consideration of duty bearersâ&#128;&#153; competencies,&#13;
                                             existing responsibilities, and available resources.&#13;
            Risk of negative externalities   Policy instrument minimizes unintended negative impacts. Targeted beneficiaries,&#13;
                                             non-beneficiaries, and other non-regulated stakeholders do not experience&#13;
                                             foreseeable unintended costs or ill effects as a result of the policy instrument.&#13;
            Suitable flexibility             Policy instrument is predictably flexible in addressing varying situations. The&#13;
                                             policy instrument allows for timely revision when the underlying social and&#13;
                                             political circumstances have changed. The policy instrument is explicit in defining&#13;
                                             the conditions under which its terms should be revised.&#13;
            Resistance to corruption         Policy instrument minimizes opportunities for corruption, rent seeking, and&#13;
                                             regulatory capture; includes mechanisms to monitor and report corruption; and&#13;
                                             provides credible and enforceable penalties for corrupt behavior. The policy&#13;
                                             instrument does not reflect the efforts of vested interests to manipulate the&#13;
                                             economic and/or legal environment to secure undue privileges or compensation&#13;
                                             at the expense of the greater public good.&#13;

  approach would be to conduct a training&#13;

  However, to achieve ICOs, semi-structured&#13;

            The standard quality assurance and
            evaluation processes for World Bank investment lending
            operation projects have often been found inadequate for
            interventions with training, technical assistance,
            South-South exchange, and other capacity development
            components. The World Bank Institute (WBI) developed the
            capacity development and results framework (CDRF) to be a
            resource for addressing this need and to help promote more
            results-focused capacity development practices. The CDRF
            provides a systematic approach for development practitioners
            to review the program logic, assess the results of capacity
            development interventions, and strengthen future projects.
            The steps outlined by the CDRF for monitoring and evaluating
            capacity development outcomes are compatible with the Bank’s
            current project cycle and can help to assure quality during
            project appraisal, implementation status and completion
            reporting, and impact evaluation. This guide describes how
            to apply the CDRF for reviewing the results of existing or
            completed capacity development projects within the WB’s
            lending portfolio.
