         National, regional, or global networks of parliamentarians are proving important vehicles for&#13;
      enhancing their capacity and the effectiveness of parliaments and parliamentarians in developing&#13;
      countries. The networks have been particularly active in fighting corruption and mitigating its negative&#13;
      impacts on economic and human development. This Capacity Development (CD) Brief reviews the&#13;
      activities of several such networks worldwide at the individual, regional, and global levels that are&#13;
      making a difference in the ability of parliamentarians to address corruption in their countries.&#13;

            Developing capacity through networks:
            lessons from anticorruption parliamentary coalitions
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            National, regional, or global networks
            of parliamentarians are proving important vehicles for
            enhancing their capacity and the effectiveness of
            parliaments and parliamentarians in developing countries.
            The networks have been particularly active in fighting
            corruption and mitigating its negative impacts on economic
            and human development. This Capacity Development (CD) Brief
            reviews the activities of several such networks worldwide at
            the individual, regional, and global levels that are making
            a difference in the ability of parliamentarians to address
            corruption in their countries.
