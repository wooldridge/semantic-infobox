THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT&#13;
For policy makers trying to improve their economyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW&#13;
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory&#13;
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides&#13;
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business&#13;
                                                               Region: Europe &amp; Central Asia&#13;
based on indicator sets that measure and benchmark&#13;
regulations applying to domestic small to medium-size          Income category: High income&#13;
businesses through their life cycle. Economies are ranked&#13;
from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 4,236,400&#13;
Doing Business presents results for 2 aggregate measures:&#13;
the distance to frontier score and the ease of doing           GNI per capita (US$): 13,020&#13;
business ranking. The ranking of economies is determined&#13;
by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 40&#13;
rounded to two decimals. An economyâ&#128;&#153;s distance to&#13;
frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 39*&#13;
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.&#13;

The ease of doing business ranking compares economies&#13;
with one another; the distance to frontier score               DB 2015 DTF: 72.5&#13;

tells only part of the story, so do changes in that ranking.          This measure shows how far on average an economy is&#13;
Yearly movements in rankings can provide some indication              from the best performance achieved by any economy on&#13;

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on&#13;
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and&#13;
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,&#13;
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are&#13;
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the&#13;
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.&#13;

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last yearâ&#128;&#153;s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such&#13;
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest&#13;
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory&#13;
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific areaâ&#128;&#148;for example, insolvencyâ&#128;&#148;it&#13;
receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark. Similarly, an economy receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a&#13;
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the&#13;
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economyâ&#128;&#153;s name&#13;
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business&#13;

      BuildCo must obtain a decision from the Municipal Authority on&#13;
      utility fees, based on the construction permit. The amount of the&#13;
      fee depends on the building size (in cubic meters) and on the&#13;
      location. Zagreb is divided into four zones for the purposes of&#13;
      communal fee calculations. The communal fee is set from HRK&#13;
      56 to HRK 118 per cubic meter of a building, depending on the&#13;
      zone. The Doing Business case study warehouse would be&#13;
      located in Zagreb zone III, with the communal fee set at HRK 75      22 days     HRK 292,613&#13;
9&#13;
      per cubic meter. The fee can be paid in full or in installments.&#13;
&#13;
      According to Regulation on Procedure of Determining Volume of&#13;
      Buildings for Communal Fee Calculation currently in force, the&#13;
      volume of the buliding is used, and as for the warehouse used in&#13;
      the Doing Buisness case study, the volume of the warehouse is&#13;
      3901.5 cubic meters. Therefore the cost is 3901.5 * HRK 75.&#13;

GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
Access to reliable and affordable electricity is vital for     WHAT THE GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
businesses. To counter weak electricity supply, many&#13;
firms in developing economies have to rely on self-            INDICATORS MEASURE&#13;
supply, often at a prohibitively high cost. Whether&#13;
electricity is reliably available or not, the first step for   Procedures to obtain an electricity connection&#13;
a customer is always to gain access by obtaining a             (number)&#13;
connection.&#13;
                                                                 Submitting all relevant documents and&#13;

Reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index&#13;
&#13;
The reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs      Doing Business uses the system average interruption&#13;
index encompasses quantitative data on the duration        duration index (SAIDI) and the system average&#13;
and frequency of power outages as well as                  interruption frequency index (SAIFI) to measure the&#13;
qualitative information on the mechanisms put in           duration and frequency of power outages in the largest&#13;
place by the utility for monitoring power outages          business city of each economy (for 11 economies the data&#13;
and restoring power supply, the reporting                  are also collected for the second largest business city).&#13;
relationship between the utility and the regulator for     SAIDI is the average total duration of outages over the&#13;
power outages, the transparency and accessibility of       course of a year for each customer served, while SAIFI is&#13;
tariffs and whether the utility faces a financial          the average number of service interruptions experienced&#13;
deterrent aimed at limiting outages (such as a             by a customer in a year. Annual data (covering the&#13;
requirement to compensate customers or pay fines           calendar year) are collected from distribution utility&#13;
when outages exceed a certain cap).                        companies and national regulators on SAIDI and SAIFI.&#13;

The index ranges from 0 to 8, with higher values&#13;
indicating greater reliability of electricity supply and&#13;
greater transparency of tariffs.&#13;

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the&#13;
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12&#13;
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does&#13;
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of&#13;
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about&#13;
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for&#13;
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff&#13;
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.&#13;

       Obtain the land registry extract from the competent land register&#13;
       court&#13;
&#13;
       Obtaining a land registry extract has become a crucial part during the&#13;
       preparation process for the purchase of a real estate, since the land&#13;
       registry extract enjoys public faith.&#13;
&#13;
       Due diligence requires that the buyer knows the status of the land&#13;
       registry. Not knowing it can also result in conflicts on the property.&#13;
       The extract must be stamped by the Land Register Court in order to be&#13;
       verified. This usually does not take more than one day.&#13;
       Croatia has been in the process of computerizing the Registry. This&#13;
       process is still in its early stages. As the process of computerizing the&#13;
       registry is progressing, the number of properties for which data are&#13;
       available online and electronic Land Registry Extracts can be obtained is&#13;
       notably increasing.                                                           1 day&#13;

       Parties can obtain an electronic Land Registry Extract for a property that&#13;
       has been entered in the database. However, electronic extracts are not&#13;
       considered official extracts when it comes to using them for collateral&#13;
       purposes. Only Extracts obtained in paper directly in the Land Registry,&#13;
       have the legal power; the same applies for the cadastre extracts.&#13;

      Notary notarizes the sale contract&#13;
&#13;
      The sale contract contains a clausula intabulandi (i.e. the declaration by&#13;
      the seller that the purchaser may be entered in the land register) and is&#13;
      prepared by parties or by the lawyer. Pursuant to the Croatian law on&#13;
      Ownership and Other Property Rights and Land Registry Act (OG 55/13)&#13;
      it is defined that for the transfer of the property there is only a signature&#13;
      by the person whose rights have been restricted, encumbered,&#13;
      terminated or conveyed to another person (Article 52). In accordance to&#13;
      this law, the public notary verifies signature of the seller (the party whose&#13;
      property right will be terminated by the contract).&#13;
&#13;
      The notary is authorized to obtain official extracts from the Company                             HRK 47.5 per&#13;

      values, there is a fixed fee on a scale. In addition to that, according to&#13;
      the Lawyers' Fee Schedule and Cost Compensation, for drafting the sales&#13;
      contract, the lawyer is entitled to the remuneration calculated according&#13;
      to the value of the propriety increased by 25 %. Further on, the lawyerâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
      fee is increased by VAT (25%) and the expenses incurred while rendering&#13;

      Register the title transfer at the Land Registry Court&#13;
&#13;
      The request for the property registration must be submitted to the&#13;
      Registry by the parties on the appropriate registration form approved by&#13;
      the Ministry of Justice. However, the request shall not be rejected just&#13;
      because it was not submitted on the prescribed registration form. The&#13;
      participation of an attorney is not mandatory, but if one is involved, his     1-2 months&#13;
      fees will be about 0.5% of the property value. The Registry conducts the     (simultaneous       To be paid in&#13;

      conducted by an experienced lawyer. Depending on the various courts,&#13;
      this process may take even longer. It should be highlighted that only the&#13;
      final decision, the one allowing the registration, produces the legal&#13;
      effect. However, regardless of the time when the final decision is&#13;
      rendered, the date of applying for registration will be the date marked in&#13;

      the Registry as the moment of transferring the ownership title. From that&#13;
      moment the party is protected towards all applications submitted&#13;
      afterwards. This rule is called the rule of priority: the buyer has the legal&#13;
      right to dispose of the property (to sell, lease, bequeath, transfer by gift,&#13;
      and mortgage the property). From that moment until the final&#13;
      registration the buyer has "quasi ownership". Therefore, even before the&#13;
      registration is completed, the first buyer - quasi owner can sell the&#13;
      property to another, second buyer. However there is a risk if the final&#13;
      registration of the first buyer - quasi owner is not allowed. In that case he&#13;
      will be liable for damage towards the second buyer. In practice the other&#13;
      contractual party will probably not be willing to enter into the legal&#13;
      transactions with the person who is not the legal owner of the real-estate&#13;
      in question (or take the risk). From 2004 the Court no longer accepts&#13;
      incomplete applications. If the registration form contains certain&#13;
      deficiencies, the court will not invite the applicant to correct the request&#13;
      but will immediately dismiss the application. The applicant may submit a&#13;
      new request, which will then have a lower rank. This has resulted in some&#13;
      reduction of backlog at the Courts and has also led to higher demand for&#13;
      professional assistance with the application process. Furthermore,&#13;
      changes in 2005 entrust the Land Registry clerks with the authority to&#13;
      decide on applications, with judges deciding on appeals. With&#13;
      registration moving from a judicial process to a more administrative&#13;
      process, this is a welcome change that indicates potential for decreasing&#13;
      the amount of time for registration. Recent internal reorganization of&#13;
      the Land Books also indicates future potential for increased efficiency.&#13;

PAYING TAXES&#13;
Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes&#13;
faster, easier and less costly for businessesâ&#128;&#148;such as by          have brought concrete results. Some economies&#13;
consolidating payments and filings of taxes, offering             simplifying tax payment and reducing rates have seen&#13;
electronic systems for filing and payment, establishing           tax revenue rise. What tax reforms has Doing Business&#13;

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal&#13;
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:&#13;
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the&#13;
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is&#13;
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.&#13;

The distance to frontier score captures the gap between&#13;

Calculating the distance to frontier score for each           or construction, including legal index scores (such as the&#13;

the nonlinear transformation, an increase in the total tax&#13;
rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier&#13;
score for the total tax rateâ&#128;&#148;and therefore on the&#13;

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it&#13;
would have had before this approach was adopted in&#13;
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in&#13;
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for&#13;
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is&#13;
very high relative to the average), an increase has a&#13;
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores&#13;
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line&#13;
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).&#13;

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and&#13;
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to&#13;
that from the simple average method because both these methods&#13;
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise&#13;
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the&#13;
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,&#13;
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the&#13;
context of a specific economy.&#13;
5&#13;
  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according&#13;
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned&#13;
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit&#13;

            Doing business 2016 : measuring regulatory
            quality and efficiency - Croatia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This economy profile for Doing Business
            2016 presents the 11 Doing Business indicators for Croatia.
            To allow for useful comparison, the profile also provides
            data for other selected economies (comparator economies) for
            each indicator. Doing Business 2016 is the 13th edition in a
            series of annual reports measuring the regulations that
            enhance business activity and those that constrain it.
            Economies are ranked on their ease of doing business; for
            2015 Croatia ranks 40. A high ease of doing business ranking
            means the regulatory environment is more conducive to the
            starting and operation of a local firm. Doing Business
            presents quantitative indicators on business regulations and
            the protection of property rights that can be compared
            across 189 economies from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe and over
            time. Doing Business sheds light on how easy or difficult it
            is for a local entrepreneur to open and run a small to
            medium-size business when complying with relevant
            regulations. It measures and tracks changes in regulations
            affecting 11 areas in the life cycle of a business: starting
            a business, dealing with construction permits, getting
            electricity, registering property, getting credit,
            protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across
            borders, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency and labor
            market regulation. The data in this report are current as of
            June 1, 2015 (except for the paying taxes indicators, which
            cover the period from January to December 2014).
