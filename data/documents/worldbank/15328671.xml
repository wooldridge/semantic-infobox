&#13;
CHAIRllAN:         I think we might as well come to order.         The American Elcecutive Director is&#13;
(KcCloy)&#13;
                   not here.   I think he nll be here very shortly.         First item is the llinutes&#13;
&#13;
                   of the ll8th Regular Meeting of the Executive Directors.         They have been&#13;
&#13;
                   distributed.   If there are no comments, I will declare them approved â&#128;¢. I am&#13;
&#13;
                   going to skip item 2 until the American Executive Director gets here, and&#13;
&#13;
                   until Mr. Garner gets here.        Item 3 is a formal resolution to approve the&#13;
&#13;
                   type of subscription receipt for capital stock.         You all have the form of&#13;
&#13;
                   the receipt before you.&#13;
&#13;
                   RESOLVED that the form of Part-Paid Subscription Receipt for capital stock&#13;
&#13;
                   of the Bank which bas been presented to this meeting be, and it hereby is,&#13;
                                                         "0":Â·&#13;
                   approved;   that the       Trea~r''ti6, and   he hereby is, authorized and directed&#13;
&#13;
                   from time to tiJlle   to   issue to each member of the Bank Part-Paid Subscription&#13;
&#13;
                   Receipts substantially in said form in order to evidence the amounts paid by&#13;
&#13;
                   such member on account of its subscription to the capital stock of the Bank;&#13;
&#13;
                   and that the Treasurer or       arv   Assistant Treasurer be, and each of them hereby&#13;
&#13;
                   i.s, authorized from time to time to sign in the name and on behalf of the&#13;
&#13;
                   Bank Part-Paid Subscription Receipts for suCh purpose.&#13;
                   This bas been approved by Counsel, and I think it is simply normal procedure&#13;
&#13;
                   and appropriate procedure.        Does anyone have any question about the form of&#13;
&#13;
                   receipt or the resolution?        If not, do I hear a motion to adopt the resolu-&#13;
&#13;
                   tion?   .Moved by Sir Gordon Munro, seconded by Professor K. Varvaressos.&#13;
&#13;
                   All those in favor please say aye. (Ayes)          contrary minded? (none)   So ordered.&#13;

&#13;
                                                     - 64,0-&#13;
&amp;#12;We have been making some efforts to push. ahead the time for the Third Annual&#13;
&#13;
Meeting, but the best we can do is to move it from September 30, which was&#13;
&#13;
the suggestion at the last meeting, to September 27 and to hold it at the&#13;
&#13;
Shoreham Hotel.&#13;
&#13;
We have received a communication from Sir Arthur Salter, in response to rq&#13;
&#13;
letter to him, which you saw, (Note: The Executive Directors saw the memo-&#13;
&#13;
rarrlum R-142, not the letter of transmittal) which was related to the&#13;
&#13;
functions and operations of the      Adviso~   Council.   Sir Arthur's letter,&#13;
&#13;
i f it has not already been distributed, will be distributed to you.           It in&#13;
&#13;
substance agrees to the suggestions that we made am says that he 1fil.1 be&#13;
&#13;
here on July   14,   preparato~   to the proposed July 19 meeting of the      Adviso~&#13;
&#13;
Council.   We will do some thinking on this ma.tter of the agenda for the&#13;
&#13;
Advisory Comtcil, and any suggestions anybody has we will be       ve~   glad to&#13;
&#13;
have.   I think it is not too early to think about what they might       b~   doing.&#13;
&#13;
I have sent forward to Senator Vandenberg, at his request, certain statistical&#13;
&#13;
data and other material, in answer to the Committee's request for data, am&#13;
&#13;
that letter and the material is in process of circulation aIlDngst you&#13;
&#13;
(Secre~ls      Memorandum No. 337).     It is being mimeographed now, it was not&#13;
&#13;
ready at the time of the Board meeting.        It is in the main the same thing,&#13;
&#13;
as you have already seen, except for the letter, which e:xplains the amount&#13;
&#13;
and type of work which the Staff did.       It is the same papers that have been&#13;
&#13;
submitted to you, but we have submitted as Annex I, as you will find, of&#13;
&#13;
that material, a paper by the staff on the evaluation of the CEEC Report&#13;
&#13;
and that Annex is dated December 16.        The one we submitted to you on January&#13;
&#13;
8 had a ane revised figures in it, but in order to give them the figures which&#13;
&#13;
we thought would be more useful to them, in the light of the figures they&#13;
&#13;
already bad, we went back and picked up the original calculation and added&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  - 641 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             (&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          to the two other Annexes.     I do not think anything more to report on the&#13;
&#13;
          European Recovery Program.     I think you have all gotten the summaries of&#13;
&#13;
          both the House ani the Senate Hearings, so you know as much about it as I&#13;
&#13;
          do.   Tbere is some suggestion that I have heard          infonnal~   of a definite&#13;
&#13;
          attempt to speed the thing up, but I do not know how reliable "that is.&#13;
&#13;
          There are two matters that I want to discuss this morning:             one is the&#13;
&#13;
          question of the modification of the system of charging interest and the&#13;
&#13;
          commitment fee on loans; and then I would like to have the Board consider&#13;
&#13;
          informa~   the action of the Fund ani some of the questions that raises&#13;
&#13;
          in cOIUlection with the devaluation of the franc.           Mr. Gutt has invited me&#13;
&#13;
          to come over ani talk to him this afternoon about the action taken by the&#13;
          Fund ani by France.      Our discussion this morning will be without benefit&#13;
&#13;
          of what he has to say this afternoon, but that was the first opportunity&#13;
&#13;
          he had to ta1.k to me.     I will be glad to   COrr'ley   allY' information I receive&#13;
&#13;
          from him to the Board, and we will come back to that question in just a&#13;
&#13;
          minute; but before that I will go back to Item 2, if I may, which is the&#13;
&#13;
          matter of the system of charging interest.        I will ask Mr. a8.rner to talk&#13;
&#13;
          to you about that.    He has been working on it more than I have and has&#13;
&#13;
          been in touch with the Financial Policy Conmdttee, and we will then call&#13;
&#13;
          on the Chairman of the Committee.&#13;
&#13;
GARNER:   Last Spring when we drafted guiding principles for handling our loans we&#13;
&#13;
          were faced with the prospect of rather general loans, which would be dis-&#13;
&#13;
          bursed by and large in a     fair~   short period.        Therefore we suggested that&#13;
&#13;
          when the loan agreement came into effect we would start the charging of a&#13;
&#13;
          colIlllitment fee of li%, and as the money was drawn down we would start&#13;
&#13;
          charging interest on the amounts actually drawn down.            At that time we noted&#13;
&#13;
          that in exceptional cases of projects requiring a long period of time, to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          - 642 -&#13;
&amp;#12;c00lp1ete a very slow drmr-dawn over an extended period, we thought that&#13;
&#13;
some modification 9f that principal might be necessary.     We are working on&#13;
&#13;
certain loans now for construction purposes, where the period of draw-dawn&#13;
&#13;
or actual disbursement of the funds might run over sever1 years, am there-&#13;
&#13;
fore it seemed to us necessary to add to this modifying clause, whichÂ· says&#13;
&#13;
that we might have to consider alteration in that practice in such cases.&#13;
&#13;
Therefore we have proposed a revised basis, 'Which should be equitable to&#13;
&#13;
borrowers, Whether they draw their funds down quickly or whether they draw&#13;
&#13;
them down over a considerable period.     The basic assumption that we had to&#13;
&#13;
make and which we discussed thoroughly with the Financial Policy Committee&#13;
&#13;
is that under existing conditions in the money market and in our own&#13;
&#13;
financing we have to have the money in the Bank before we can make a comm1t-&#13;
&#13;
mente   We cannot under present circumstances afford to commit several years&#13;
&#13;
ahead, in the hope that we would be able to raise the money.     Now that&#13;
&#13;
si tuation may change, we hope it will change in the future, which might&#13;
&#13;
enable modification of our present proposal, but at the present time there&#13;
&#13;
seems ttl be general agreement that it would be totally imprudent for the&#13;
&#13;
Bank to make a commitment unless we had the money in hand.     Now if these&#13;
&#13;
long term projects, such as the oonstruction of power plants, take several&#13;
&#13;
years to complete - and they are noÂ·, good unless completed, neither from the&#13;
&#13;
standpoint of the Bank, or the borrower, - could we afford to pu:t up the&#13;
&#13;
money for one-third of,   s~,   a dam unless we and the borrower k:new the&#13;
&#13;
money would be forthcoming to complete the dam.     If we have to have the&#13;
&#13;
IDOney in hand before we make a camaitment, it means that we have to borrow&#13;
&#13;
the money in advance of the commitment and we would have to pay interest&#13;
&#13;
on the securities that we issue from the time we borrowed.     That is the&#13;
&#13;
same situation that usuaJ..:Q" exists in private finanCing for that type of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 643 -&#13;
&amp;#12;construction.    A company will borrow the money in advance and use it may-&#13;
&#13;
be over a period of several years, so we are faced with not the theory but&#13;
&#13;
the fact that the Bank will have to be paying interest on borrowed funds&#13;
&#13;
to cover its future coImllitments and therefore it cannot afford to take the&#13;
loss which would be incurred if we were paying interest on bonds and over a&#13;
&#13;
long period holding the money without getting interest on the loan.            So,&#13;
&#13;
brieny, we have come to this proposal that we would have the commitment&#13;
&#13;
fee on undisbursed .funds run for six months, md at the end of sU: months,&#13;
&#13;
whether or not the funds have been disbursed, interest would start.           But&#13;
&#13;
in order to attempt to lessen the burden on the borrower as much as possible,&#13;
&#13;
without injury to the Bank, the irwestment return on those allocated funds&#13;
&#13;
would be credited Â·to the borrower;        we invest our working funds, the proceeds&#13;
&#13;
of our borrowing, in short-term securities, because we can not risk the&#13;
&#13;
fluctuations in long-term securities, and have been investing in n1nety-day&#13;
&#13;
TreasllI'Y' Bills;   60   the principle would be that we would g1ve the borrcnrer&#13;
&#13;
what we earn on those .funds in the 9o-da;y- TreasllI'Y'   B~lls.   We feel, to&#13;
&#13;
summarize, that this puts all borrowers on an equitable basis.           If they&#13;
&#13;
draw down money quickly or i f they draw dawn over a period, the basis of&#13;
&#13;
charging will be the same.         The commiSSion, the statutory commiSSion, 'Which&#13;
&#13;
we must charge on loans will not begin until the money is           actua~   drawn&#13;
&#13;
down.   The difference between the present method and this new proposal under&#13;
&#13;
existing circumstances would not be very great, because 'While the borrower&#13;
&#13;
would be paying the interest rate, he is getting a return on the unused funds&#13;
&#13;
that now is   rumrl.ng     a 11ttle umer 1%, so the spread between what he earns&#13;
&#13;
on this money and what he pays in interest is not greatly out of line with&#13;
&#13;
the It% commitment charge now being paid under the present system.            The only&#13;
&#13;
other point is that if mort-tem interest rates should firm up to snch a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  - 644-&#13;
&amp;#12;GARNER:   high point that his interest credit on the undisbursed funds would amount,&#13;
(r tId)&#13;
          during the period he paid interest, to a point where he would be paying less&#13;
&#13;
          than he would be only paying the commitment fee - therefore, tlUs interest&#13;
&#13;
          credi t would be limited to the difference between the interest rates on the&#13;
&#13;
          loan and the commitment fee, lIhich ~ at the present time would be 1 3/4%.&#13;
&#13;
          That matter was discussed with the Financial Policy Committee, and we would&#13;
&#13;
          like to hear from Mr. Beyen.&#13;
&#13;
BEYEN:    I have little to add.   I would like to say that after we have had a discussion&#13;
&#13;
          there is one little point I would like to bring up in connection with the&#13;
&#13;
          paper.   In connection with the proposal, the Financial Policy Committee&#13;
&#13;
          thought that was the right thing to do.       The whole idea of   11%   between&#13;
&#13;
          commitment and disbursement is based on a conception     ~ere     the Bank could&#13;
&#13;
          expect to be able to borrow money from the market under conditions more&#13;
&#13;
          favorable than have eventuated.    As    long as the condition hasn't arisen,&#13;
&#13;
          it is fair and equal that the commitment should be paid for by the borrower.&#13;
&#13;
          The Financial Policy Committee felt generally, but with regret, agreed that&#13;
&#13;
          this particular solution it is the only sensible thing to do.           The only&#13;
&#13;
          thing we again stress; that we are in agreement, of course, that all our&#13;
&#13;
          principles in this respect are tent.ati vee     Our position is developing, we&#13;
&#13;
          are just now in the field, and lIhen conditions change and get more easy,&#13;
&#13;
          it is of course understood that this whole policy will be revised from time&#13;
&#13;
          to time, and that is everybody's intention - although on the one band keep-&#13;
          ing in mind that the Bank should be run on sound lines - certainly the idea&#13;
&#13;
          of a cooperative institution like our Bank is that the terms to the borrower&#13;
&#13;
          should be as lenient as the actual situation at the moment allows.           I think&#13;
&#13;
          that is the general view of the Financial Policy Committee as expressed at&#13;
&#13;
          their meeting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         - 645 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                          (&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C   .RMAN:   Well that, I think, represents the discussion and reasoning which las taken&#13;
&#13;
             place.   I suppose that this action in putting this policy into effect would&#13;
&#13;
             pro bably follow the same procedure as before.   I think at that time the Board&#13;
&#13;
             was advised and took note of the recommendation made.     I simply say that we&#13;
&#13;
             subscribe to the sentiments expressed by Mr. Bayen.     Unless there is objection&#13;
&#13;
             we will go ahead on that basis for the time being.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPENOT:    I would like to say a word in this connection.   The Bank and its Board are&#13;
&#13;
             in sane way in a kind of partnership, as Mr. Beyen just said.     It is that&#13;
&#13;
             the borrowers are not entitled to take funds at any time they want.     Before&#13;
&#13;
             getting the funds they must present some papers that are examined by the&#13;
&#13;
             Bank, and. to get the money they have to satisfy the Bank that everything is&#13;
&#13;
             all right.   There may be some delay between the time when those demands are&#13;
&#13;
             presented by the borrower and the time when the Bank gives the money, even&#13;
&#13;
             ifewrything is all right.    A few extra weeks, months.    lklring that time&#13;
&#13;
             the money has been paid by the borrower or spent for the importation of&#13;
&#13;
             equipment and additionally during that time he will have to be paying in-&#13;
&#13;
             terest on the undisbursed Bank loan.    He will be charged interest and he is&#13;
&#13;
             himself out of funds.&#13;
&#13;
GHAIRMAN;    He has a commitment.    There is no suggestion of any interest payments before.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPENOT:    Between the time he intended to draw his money and the time the money gets&#13;
&#13;
             to him there is a certain amount of time, six months, or four months, where&#13;
&#13;
             he is doubly bUrdened and he only gets his money at the end of that time at&#13;
&#13;
             the pleasure of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
CHAI.RMAN:   We have to examine the draw-down papers you mean.     But that varies so much&#13;
&#13;
             with the type of eqUipment, 'What the proceeds are being used for, that you&#13;
&#13;
             can't, I don't see how you can generalize.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          - 61..6-&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       (&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
t-   .   VARESSOS :   Is it the commitment fee or the interest?      We have a six months period for&#13;
&#13;
                      the commitment fee.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPENar:             After that period.     Certain time elapses before he gets the money from the&#13;
&#13;
                      Bank; he has paid the money on sa:y, the first of April, he tells the Bank&#13;
&#13;
                      I am good for ten million dollars and the Bank tells him we will look into&#13;
&#13;
                      it and disburse the money i f it is in order, but he has to pay interest, on&#13;
&#13;
                      that money in the meantime; after a three months period, say, the Bank tells&#13;
&#13;
                      him all right you can get your ten million dollars.       But between that time,&#13;
&#13;
                      the time he is entitled to get the money and the time he actually ha'S it, he&#13;
&#13;
                      has to pay interest.&#13;
&#13;
GARNER:               Under this proposal, if that occurred in the first six months, he would not&#13;
&#13;
                      be until he actually got it.     After six months he can draw down quickly as&#13;
&#13;
                      his requirements demaIXl.&#13;
&#13;
1        /ENar:       Subject to examination of the Bank.       It may takeÂ· some time for him to get his&#13;
&#13;
                      money and during that period when is entitled to have the money he is paying&#13;
&#13;
                      interest.     Suppose everything is all right with his paper, nevertheless,&#13;
&#13;
                      for a certain period, two, three or four months he is paying interest with-&#13;
&#13;
                      out having the Bank's money.&#13;
&#13;
GARNER:               If you give us good papers you might get the money that afternoon.       No such&#13;
&#13;
                      delay as that.&#13;
&#13;
CRENA DE IONGH: One or two days only.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:             There is a stimulus to get your papers in shape.       It is very important.   The&#13;
&#13;
                      period we bave delayed to date has been very minor.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPENar:             I don't think of any special. case in point, but in general theory.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:             If he has his papers he gets it that afternoon.       And he should have his&#13;
&#13;
                      papers.     A good many come to us and say they have not had time to complete&#13;
&#13;
                      the papers.    We have been lenient about it when they have said we have not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      - 647 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                our papers in shape yet, sometimes we have advanced, but it is not good&#13;
&#13;
                procedure.       We ought to keep up the pressure.     There is no physical im-&#13;
&#13;
                pediment to getting the paper.&#13;
&#13;
VARVARESSOS I   I think   lire   Hoppenot is afraid that the policy of control might be extended,&#13;
&#13;
                that is to say before he gets the papers agreed, that is to say the money he&#13;
&#13;
                wants is really within the agreement and within the provisions of the contract.&#13;
&#13;
                It might be some time before he gets it.       The Bank might want to exercise&#13;
&#13;
                some control am it might be not impossible for this delay to extend to a&#13;
&#13;
                fortnight or three weeks.       I do not think it will be more than that.&#13;
&#13;
GARNER:         The Treasurer shakes his head even on that.          If you have the papers in shape&#13;
&#13;
                it should not take more than a day or two.&#13;
&#13;
VARVARESSOS:    They will have spent some money for a cOIllllodity whereafter some difference&#13;
&#13;
                of opinion might arise.&#13;
&#13;
Ch.   ~t:MAN;   It is .not going to take say three months.&#13;
&#13;
CRENA DE IONGH: Especially with our system of working with New York banks, who send us right&#13;
&#13;
                array all the papers we need.      It should not take more than two days or three&#13;
&#13;
                days at the most, because we can then get in the right form and that is hOlt'&#13;
&#13;
                it works, and even before we have instituted this new system, trere have not&#13;
&#13;
                been an;y delays of that nature.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:       I think 'that this is decisive.      There may be a situation developed if they&#13;
&#13;
                did get to such an extensive period.&#13;
&#13;
BEYEN:          A difference of opinion might arise.        One of the parties to the difference&#13;
&#13;
                would have to be paying for the time in which the difference could be&#13;
&#13;
                settled.     That is the only case of hardship I can think of.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:       That has not arisen yet, and I do not believe it will arise.          It might arise,&#13;
&#13;
                conceivably it might.       We might have an impasse at some point where we say&#13;
&#13;
                we   will not put the money out.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  - 648 -&#13;
&amp;#12;BEY&amp;N:           It might arise that there would be a difference of opinion about papers;&#13;
&#13;
                 therefore the account has to lay out the money am at the same time to pay&#13;
&#13;
                 interest.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIIDlA.N:      I would hate at this stage to take any steps which would tend to make the&#13;
&#13;
                 borrower less alert.       The tendency is to lag a bit.   They just do not get&#13;
&#13;
                 around to it.     I would rather have the pattern develop than modify the&#13;
&#13;
                 principle.     If we have a situation arise then it would become a big issue.&#13;
&#13;
BEYEN:           If there 'WOuld arise a serious cause of difference which might lead to&#13;
&#13;
                 arbitration, one might consider in that particular case it would be all&#13;
&#13;
                 right, as long as arbitration went on, to waive any interest.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:        But to try on - loans would not be workable.&#13;
&#13;
VARVARESSOS :    Make a condition that the borrower is refunded the interest if he will&#13;
&#13;
                 prove he is right, but not if the Bank was right.&#13;
&#13;
W    1!;NOT:     There was a point I wanted to add, but Mr. Garner has answered in advance.&#13;
&#13;
                 Re told us the interest lIOuld be refunded to the borrower in the case of&#13;
&#13;
                 his assets being in the Bank, waiting for hiD!. to draw them, in Treasury&#13;
&#13;
                 Bills.   That provision should be written into the contract, to prevent&#13;
&#13;
                 subsequent discussion arising with the Board as to what the real figure&#13;
&#13;
                 is and having the Board tell you.&#13;
&#13;
GARNER:          That will be in the contract.&#13;
&#13;
VARVA.RESSOS :   I 5h ould like to ask whether, from the time of the commitment to the time&#13;
&#13;
                 of the disbursements the borrower has to pay the whole interest, including&#13;
&#13;
                 the   1/4%   which the Bank receives, or only the interest which the Bank pays&#13;
&#13;
                 for long term.&#13;
&#13;
GARNER:          Whatever the interest rate is agreed on in the new loan.&#13;
&#13;
BLACK:           He would pay the    1/4%   margin.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  - 649 -&#13;
&amp;#12;MclAIN I        You can not determine what the rate is. 'You maybe using ten year, twenty&#13;
&#13;
                five year, and capital.        You cannot discriDiinate between borrowers.&#13;
&#13;
Gt\RNERt        You cannot make the calculation.&#13;
&#13;
VARVARESSOS:    Not the commission.      I speak about the   1/4%.   We thought the   1/4%   was for&#13;
&#13;
                the Bank to cover all.&#13;
&#13;
GARNER:         I said calculation.&#13;
&#13;
VARVARESSOS I   That the   1/4%   was in the nature of an additional guarantee, and I do not&#13;
&#13;
                know if it is justified except as a contribution to the expenses of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
                It is not justified as an additional gnarantee before the borrower has the&#13;
&#13;
                money disbursed.      It is complicated, I agree, but I think it.&#13;
&#13;
BRESCIANI:      Our President has very rightly, in the hearings before the Senate, drawn&#13;
&#13;
                our attention to the burden which loans may represent to the European countries.&#13;
&#13;
                It seems now that 'there are maI\V other things contributing to the danger that&#13;
&#13;
                these loans call for a longer time before the way is paved for prl vate invest-&#13;
&#13;
                ment.   Without doubt this new provision is a very severe additional burden&#13;
&#13;
                for the borrowers, but I perfectly realize the reasons which justify this new&#13;
&#13;
                procedure, but I feel most perplexed.        I fear it is a very great exchange&#13;
&#13;
                burden for the borrower.        SUpposing we come to a country with a loan of      $50&#13;
                million, this loan might be used only during some years, three or four years&#13;
&#13;
                from the beginning.       It   ~    be necessary to pay interest on the whole amount,&#13;
&#13;
                this is so, on the whole amount from the begi.nning.        It is true that it will&#13;
&#13;
                be only part of the interest, since 'What the Bank gets in short term. will be&#13;
&#13;
                credited.    I think the difference is very considerable and this represents&#13;
&#13;
                an additional burden for the borrowing country.         Is it possible to find some&#13;
&#13;
                measures to relieve the country of this, to render it less heavy?&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:       I think that has been the concern, but since we cannot be sure of our money&#13;
&#13;
                we cannot be in the position of paying interest and getting none.             I think&#13;
&#13;
                the only thing we can do is to operate under a prudent basis in accordance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  - 650 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                              (&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CH~""'&gt;nAAN:    with conditions as we find them.       As conditions improve we pass the benefit&#13;
(r..   .lId)&#13;
                on to borrowers, but I do not believe we can adopt a principle that the&#13;
&#13;
                burden must be put on the Bank when such burden on the Bank lIi. I I break the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BRESCIANI:      Vfuat will be the difference between the credit and the interest?     More than&#13;
&#13;
                2%1     You see it 'Will be for $100 million, $2 million every year as an&#13;
&#13;
                additional burden.&#13;
&#13;
GARNER:         Under the present system they pay 11% commitment fee anyway.      At the present&#13;
                rates it might be 1/2% more.&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:       For the 90 days the rate is over 1%1&#13;
&#13;
GARNER:         Around 1%.&#13;
&#13;
CHAI.Rl4AN :    It may go higher.     It is about 3/4% now.&#13;
&#13;
VARVARESSOS :   I do not !mow if we could find some way of alleviating the burden.       I think&#13;
&#13;
                we must realize that the Bank presently is under obligation to borrow the&#13;
&#13;
                money before commitment, because otherwise the Bank cannot make the commit-&#13;
&#13;
                mente     Then all that is accepted.    If we can find something to lighten the&#13;
&#13;
                burden of the borrower, we must find it somewhere else.      For example, in the&#13;
&#13;
                case that a loan is known to the Bank am to the borrower that :it will be&#13;
&#13;
                spread over three or four years, tM borrower knows and the Bank knows the&#13;
&#13;
                borrower will not utilize say half' of the loan for two years.      Is it not&#13;
&#13;
                possible to make an arrangelOOnt lrl. th the borrower, provided the borrower&#13;
&#13;
                accepts, the Bank makes a commitment on reservation of condition of the&#13;
&#13;
                market at that time.     I do not think the Bank will accept commitment at the&#13;
&#13;
                fixed rate of .interest in the conditions of the market at that time.       The&#13;
&#13;
                burden could be lightened :if the borrower could have the option either to&#13;
&#13;
                accept the proposed system or to be satisfied with an arrangement that the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank undertakes to find the money after two years, provided the borrower is&#13;
&#13;
                prepared to pay the interest prevailing at that time even if this interest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 651-&#13;
&amp;#12;VARVARESSOS:   is higher.    I think ttat is some fair proposal that might be made to the&#13;
    nttd}&#13;
               borrower.    That is the proposal which I have thought when I read that, and&#13;
&#13;
               I also proposed when we idscussed the whole thing before, that ~t is not&#13;
&#13;
               possible to accept that.     We arrived after that discussion, at the l~ as&#13;
&#13;
               the commitment "fee.&#13;
&#13;
BLACK:         We discussed this suggestion that Professor Varvaressos made in the Financial.&#13;
&#13;
               Policy Committee, and whether it might be possible, where you had a country&#13;
&#13;
               which is not going to use the money for a year, that you migpt arrange a&#13;
&#13;
               borrowing in that way or give them a chance to have a new rate set at the&#13;
&#13;
               em of the year.     That is the only way I can see.    Otherwise we   110 uld   be&#13;
&#13;
               taking thedlance.      On the other hand, it is very unlikely at the present time&#13;
&#13;
               i f you went to a borrowing country and suggested an arrangement like that&#13;
&#13;
               they would want to do it.     They might rather take advantage of present rates,&#13;
&#13;
               because rates are on the way up.      If they waited another year they might be up.&#13;
&#13;
VARVARESSOS:   That is up to th em.&#13;
&#13;
               There are two kinds of proposi tiona.      A country wants to build two plants.&#13;
&#13;
               They want to build one plant this year and one next.      We can give the money&#13;
&#13;
               to build the plant this year and will talk about the other plant next year.&#13;
&#13;
               But if it is one dam they spend so much this year and have nothing but a&#13;
&#13;
               half completed dam.     We would not be willing to finance half the dam because&#13;
&#13;
               we do not know whether we can, irrespective of interest rate, get the money&#13;
&#13;
               to complete the dam unless we have it now.       That is the thing which forces&#13;
&#13;
               us to this arrangement, where there is continuous construction of a single&#13;
&#13;
               type of project.    And suppose we made a commitment and fixed the interest&#13;
               rate, but lIben we came to the time we found the market was such we could not&#13;
&#13;
               borrow the money, we would have a commitment, we could have no money, we would&#13;
&#13;
               be upset and the borrower could not complete the project.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
VAFV!RESS05:        My proposal applies only to programs of reconstruction or development.       Whole&#13;
&#13;
                    programs.     To complete their program they want e200 million.   A promise of&#13;
&#13;
                    the Bank, a    commit~t   of the Bank, that it will give the money, provided&#13;
&#13;
                    that conditions at the time will be favorable.      If it is a whole program,&#13;
&#13;
                    for example, to build roads, roads to cost $200 million.&#13;
&#13;
BLACK;              Question of interest rates.&#13;
&#13;
GARNER:             We are faced with a specific thing.      The building of certain projects going&#13;
&#13;
                    to take several years to complete, those particular things, that is where we&#13;
&#13;
                    have difficulty.&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:           There is the matter about which Mr. Bresciani has told, of the heavy burden&#13;
&#13;
                    to countries: that depends on the term of the loans.       If there is, say, a&#13;
&#13;
                    short term loan for materials, probably the situation will never arise that&#13;
&#13;
                    the loan will not be spent in the first six months, and accordingly the&#13;
&#13;
                    question of burden does not arise.       If we have the longer terms of delivery,&#13;
&#13;
                    normally financed on long terms for building programs, so there is perhaps&#13;
&#13;
                    additional burden here but which is spread over a long period of years.          You&#13;
&#13;
                    amortize, in due course, as, for instance, somebody would issue share capital&#13;
&#13;
                    and will have the money with 'Which to amortize and then we will lose the&#13;
&#13;
                    interest from the building.     But that is ordinarily expected by people in&#13;
&#13;
                    business.     So if the period is reasonably long it is amortized.    That is&#13;
&#13;
                    only one thing I would like to say in this connection, i f there is Jong term&#13;
&#13;
                    delivery of goods on short term loans that is certainly a bad thing.       I can&#13;
&#13;
                    expect only that the Bank will not give such a loan: with long term of delivery&#13;
&#13;
                    and short term of maturity of loans.&#13;
&#13;
VARVAR.ESSOS:       FOz\ short term loans the difference will not arise.&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:           It will be spent immediately.&#13;
Vs __ t ARESSOS :   It arises in long term loans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   - 653 -&#13;
&amp;#12;GA   R:        Suppose there was 1% additional charge over a period of three years on a&#13;
&#13;
               twenty year loan.    It would make a difference in totaJ. cost of the loan of&#13;
&#13;
               15/100 of 1%.    It gets down to a very minor part of the total cost of the&#13;
&#13;
               loan.&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:      For the duration of the loan.&#13;
&#13;
VARVARESSOS:   Every minor particle of charge works like that, am if you add such particles&#13;
&#13;
               together you will arrive at quite a burdensome charge on the borrower.       We&#13;
&#13;
               have accepted the li%, that is the commitment fee.     We have accepted the 1/4%&#13;
&#13;
               margin as an additional assurance to the Bank, and so on.        Now we are faced&#13;
&#13;
               with some possibilities of an increase of the basic rate of interest.        All&#13;
&#13;
               that added may together amount to such a burden on the borrower as must be&#13;
&#13;
               considered.     As you remember I stressed the fact that the burden is mainly&#13;
&#13;
               one of payments transfer.     We do not see haw they will make the:ir transfers&#13;
&#13;
               if they are heavy ones.     JAy position is that in order to secure the repayment&#13;
&#13;
               of loans we must try to lighten that transfer burden, to make the burden as&#13;
&#13;
               small as possible, even to take into calculation the smallest particle.          That&#13;
&#13;
               is the only solution.     We are not here to make profits, it is not shown in&#13;
&#13;
               our policy.     We are interested in the repayment of capital.     It would be&#13;
&#13;
               disastrous to the Bank if repayment were defaulted.&#13;
&#13;
GARNER:        You are arguing against international lending in favor of international grants.&#13;
&#13;
               Under existing circumstances somebody bas to bear this burden; the Bank cannot,&#13;
&#13;
               in prudence,do more than we think here.     It is not whether it is prudent; it&#13;
&#13;
               is a question of who will pay.     It seemed to us reasonable division of burden&#13;
&#13;
               between Bank ani borrower.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRllAN:     Certa~    I think we accept the proposition that we should make our terms&#13;
&#13;
                                                                           ,&#13;
               the least burdensome possible upon the borrower; there is a good bit of talk&#13;
&#13;
               about collateral grants arising from that very conSideration, the argument&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 654 -&#13;
&amp;#12;CI   !MAN:   that I made at the Committee, strongly urging that they bear in mind the&#13;
(dent'd)&#13;
             trans1'er problems in connection with any type of internationaJ aid.     I think&#13;
&#13;
             that is being generally accepted.   The Bank I think of as a continuing inter-&#13;
&#13;
             national. banking facility that cannot get caught in the maelstrom 01' the two&#13;
&#13;
             or three year emergency period and be swept awB.;J, without having left its&#13;
&#13;
             impact on the general recovery, rehabilitation of the world.    I think it has&#13;
&#13;
             to stand as a recognized, not harsh, but prudent, banking organization that&#13;
&#13;
             can exist after the Marshall Plan aid has departed.     It is hoped that when&#13;
&#13;
             this period is. over the loan burdens will be substantially, be greatly less&#13;
&#13;
             than the amount of money that has been made necessary to bring about the&#13;
&#13;
             recovery.    But we have to think about the benefits we can render to new borrow-&#13;
&#13;
             ers as well as the burdens that our loans exert on old borrowers.      The turn-&#13;
&#13;
             over of our money, the continuity of our operations, the availability of funds&#13;
&#13;
             for new ventures; we have constantly to think, I think, of the general accept-&#13;
&#13;
             ance that the Bank and its securities have in the markets of the world, where&#13;
&#13;
             they have to raise their money, and I think a prudent, but not an exacting or&#13;
&#13;
             acquisitive instinct on the part of the Bank, because we have no instinct to&#13;
&#13;
             pay dividends to our stockholders, at least until we are in a position which&#13;
&#13;
             we are a long way from at the moment â&#128;¢. We will be alert, I   am sure, to make&#13;
&#13;
             any lightening of burden which is within reason.&#13;
&#13;
:MADAN:      I do not know whether in the kind of loan interest rate - in regard to 15(a)&#13;
&#13;
             (ii) where it is said it Eh ould be one-quarter of one percent per annum&#13;
&#13;
             higher than the net rate of interest at which the Bank can reasonably elltpect&#13;
&#13;
             to borrow.    I presume it means at the time the loan is made, it does not&#13;
&#13;
             mean the expectation of borrowing in the near future.     We might insert this -&#13;
&#13;
             "at the time the loan is made".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           - 655-&#13;
&amp;#12;BE   ':        That is badly worded now and should be revised.    It is said "at long term"&#13;
&#13;
               and it should be said at a term similar to that or the loan.     I would suggest&#13;
&#13;
               that the wording or (ii) should be cleared up.    I do not think the Board&#13;
&#13;
               meeting is the place to do drarting, I am asking the Management to submit a&#13;
&#13;
               draft which clears these t1'lO points.&#13;
&#13;
MADAN:         Does the length of the borrowing correspond to the length of the loan, am&#13;
&#13;
               also the time of borrowing, correspond to the time the loan is made?&#13;
&#13;
IIJ..ANES:     I was wondering i f in order to have a certain flexibility for certain kinds&#13;
&#13;
               of projects (because that can be raised in future), we can keep the position&#13;
&#13;
               we had before that says "in exceptional cases of projects requiring a long&#13;
&#13;
               period of time to complete some modification of this prinCiple may be nece-&#13;
&#13;
               ssary".   We had that before; now in the new drart it is left out.&#13;
&#13;
GARNER:        The new modification of principle is a formulation of that contingency.&#13;
&#13;
Ct.. _irMAN:   That is just it.   The new proposal was to be the formulation of the principle&#13;
&#13;
               which was stated in the earlier draft.    Instead of leaving it vague, this&#13;
&#13;
               was the crystallization of that.&#13;
&#13;
ILLANES:       Because there can be special circumstances in which the Bank could change&#13;
&#13;
               the policy in order to consider the project of reconstruction and develop-&#13;
&#13;
               ment that can take three, four or five years.     Perhaps the borrower can&#13;
&#13;
               make scme flexible arrangement convenient for the Bank and himself.     This&#13;
&#13;
               gives more flexibility to the Bank to deal with special cases.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:      Isn't this the special case we were trying to deal with and this was the&#13;
&#13;
               solution?&#13;
&#13;
ILLANES:       I do not think it is a solution.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:      I have stated what we have tried to bring out, a solution of this problem,.&#13;
&#13;
               I have stated that if these conditions change we would alter the solution.&#13;
&#13;
               I do not know that there is a.:n;rthing more we can add.   If the Board feels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           -   6~-&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     (&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHATRMAN:       that this policy is not sound at this point we ought to have same expression&#13;
(l   :,td)&#13;
                on it.      I would at this stage not recommend aI\Y other policy than we have&#13;
                now evolved under these conditions.          I would be prompt to   reco~nd   a different&#13;
&#13;
                one if we could see our way towards relieving the burden.           Now that is the&#13;
&#13;
                record, the way I would like to leave it.&#13;
&#13;
VARVARESSOS:    On the other hand, this is not the constitution.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRlIAN:      No.     We are advising you what our thinking is.&#13;
VARVARESSOS :   What we say is some general principle which in the opinion of the Administra-&#13;
                tion and the Board may be necessary but we shall not bind ourselves to accept&#13;
&#13;
                this.     We do not add a:nything.    It is not as if it were something not to be&#13;
                changed,as if it were a decision of the Board of Governors - that would be&#13;
                different.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:       We are trying to keep you notified of our current procedures in connection&#13;
                with loans.     And as conditions change we will notify you of the change in&#13;
                procedures, keep you current.        More than an,thing else at the present time&#13;
                this seems like a successful solution.          A year hence we might have a differ-&#13;
                ent one.&#13;
&#13;
MADAN:          If it is not a formulation of policy for the next few years, I wonder if the&#13;
&#13;
                last sentence of paragraph l5(a)(v) should not be deleted. Whether the&#13;
                charge would be less than the        11%   depends on contingency long term and short&#13;
&#13;
                term rates. Ylhether it will arise that the discrepancy is less than It%&#13;
                cannot be visualized except in the          comparative~   distant future.   It does&#13;
                not affect the substance, of course; but it might be a sop to someone to&#13;
                believe that the difference can be less than the l!%.            In that eventuality&#13;
                the borrower can have the benefit.           If you want to leave the borrower the&#13;
&#13;
                advantage, let the minimum not be imposed.           It is of no practical significance.&#13;
&#13;
                We do not show this to the borrower and I do not think pUblication would be&#13;
                wise.&#13;
&#13;
BEYEN:          It does not affect existing loans.&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 6r;f1 -&#13;
&amp;#12;             Anybody else?&#13;
             Now we have here the reverberations of the last week on this matter of the&#13;
             French franc.   We have had a number of inquiries and naturally 'We have thought&#13;
             a good bit about what effect the new French devaluation policy and the posi-&#13;
             tion of the Fund may have upon our operations.    I think it is a little early&#13;
             to come to any conclusions, definitive conclusions, about it, but it does,&#13;
             actually does pose some problems for us.    As I said earlier, we are going&#13;
             to have a meeting with llr. Gutt this afternoon, and we may learn more as a&#13;
             result of that.   I do not suppose we are so much interested, a1though we are&#13;
             indirectly interested, in any phas.e of this problem, with its technical as-&#13;
             pects.   Generally I think.we are very much concerned as to any action which&#13;
             takes place in the Fund, where the action of the Fund is contrary to the&#13;
             action of one of its Members.     There are certain direct results that will&#13;
             flow from this action, which time will probably disclose, better than thea-&#13;
             rising, there are certain imponderables that will result.    The specific&#13;
             question that I think we shall have to face is what action, if any, do we&#13;
             take in connection with any loans that may be pending or any applications&#13;
             which may be received in future, in the light of the action of the Fund and&#13;
             the attitude of the Fund. As you know, we have no direct statutory inter-&#13;
             relation with the Fund, except for the provision for membership in the Bank,&#13;
             and I recall that   me~ership   in the Fund is a prerequisite to membership in&#13;
             theÂ· Bank.   I believe expulsion from the Fund does not automatica1l7 result&#13;
             in expulsion from the Bank.     Isn't that it?&#13;
&#13;
McUIN:       Unless the Bank otherwise decides within a period of three months.&#13;
&#13;
CHAImfA.Na   It is conceivable once having acquired membership we could continue in the&#13;
             Bank a member who is no longer a member of the Fund.     But we are not talking&#13;
             about expulsion at this point.     And we have in the past and continue in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           - 6'i8 -&#13;
&amp;#12;ca     'lAAN:   future to main relationships with the Fund, rather close relationships, we&#13;
( COll'&amp;td)&#13;
                have consulted and continue to consult with the Fund on monetary systems of&#13;
                the countries as that may affect any country, and generall7 we have proceeded&#13;
                in sympathy with the Fund in its efforts to bring about stabilized currencies.&#13;
                The question that I suppose will be most acutely raised with us is as to&#13;
                whether we should extend - the extent we should take into account the action&#13;
                of the Fund in extending - the privileges of the Bank to its Members. I have&#13;
&#13;
                come to no conclusions on it myself.       I think it is a matter which the Board&#13;
                must consider, think about,    50   does the management.   I do not know wbether&#13;
                it is appropriate to discuss it today when there is no real issue before us,&#13;
                but I bring it up so that if anyone cares to say anything we would be glad&#13;
                to have you do so.     There is. another phase of it which less directly affects&#13;
                the Bank, which I think is unfortunate, and that is its relation to the&#13;
                European Recovery Program.     We had at the beginning of one week some spectacu-&#13;
                lar developments in connection with the economic unity of Europe and by the&#13;
                end of the week we had spectacular developments about the difference of view&#13;
                and differences of opinion and some very fundamental disagreements.        From&#13;
                what I have heard about the developments of the European Recovery Program&#13;
                the concept of a collective consideration of their economic problems was&#13;
                rather   catchi~g   hold in the Congress and it was an element that gave rise&#13;
                to considerable optimism and I thought it boded well for the European Recovery&#13;
                Program.    I think that enthusiasm has been a little diluted since that time.&#13;
                I do not know whether any irreparable harm has occurred, but I think it is&#13;
                unfortunate that these events followed so closely one upon the other. We&#13;
                have had an analysis made of the immediate effects of the action taken by&#13;
&#13;
                France, and the action taken by the Fund, they are very tentative, and I&#13;
                think we would probably want to have a little more information from the Fund&#13;
                before we had a document that we would feel was worth while circulating.           I&#13;
                do not believe anything occurred. that â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&amp;#12;             I want to say one thing.   I want to start by saying that I sincerely hope&#13;
             there will be no question of suspension of members.       As far as I know, there&#13;
             is very little reason to expect that there will be suspension of the member.&#13;
             I want in any case to draw your attention to the fact that suspension of a&#13;
&#13;
             member is not within our competence, it is not one of the powers which has&#13;
             been given to the Board of Directors, it is reserved to the Board of Governors.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:    But the question of the facilities that we extend remains with the Directors,&#13;
             does it not?&#13;
BEIEN:       Well, I cannot say, it might be doubtful, even as a matter of principle, but&#13;
             the question of suspension is out.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMANs    No question about that.    That is a matter for the Governors to determine,&#13;
             but the question of the extent to which we collaborate with the Fund as it&#13;
             withholds privileges, how far do we go, that is the field in which I am a&#13;
             little â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢&#13;
BEYEN:       We might disagree on the question of principle.&#13;
CHAIRMAN:    That is just it.&#13;
GARNER:      Also a question of economics.    The fact that a country might have access to&#13;
             the Fund for exchange resourceS has some bearing in appraising economic&#13;
&#13;
             plans.   It ndght be small or large.    As to ability to meet obligations â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
BEYEN:       I want to be enlightened on this subject, it cannot affect any existing&#13;
             loan, can it?&#13;
CHAIRMAN:    I don't think so.&#13;
BEYEN:       I think, is an7 application for a loan under inspection1&#13;
CHAIRMAN:    You never can tell about that.&#13;
&#13;
BEYEN:       The Whole problem is theoretical then, as far as that is concerned.&#13;
,--. ImaN.   Not entirely.   Recently in a very informal way the French have been to see&#13;
             us saying can't we extend our loan     a little bit;   we would like to get some&#13;
             more :mney; we are taking these steps in connection with our monetary&#13;
&amp;#12;CH~TRMAN       :   situation.    Nothing as to the terms.        I think they are just f'eeJing us out.&#13;
(c.   .. 'd)&#13;
                   Management is not at the point of recommending the loan.           In tha.t sense&#13;
&#13;
                   then the question is academic.        None the less, some thinking on the problem&#13;
&#13;
                   is necessary, as you may have it in connection with other countries - some&#13;
&#13;
                   multiple currency countries that may be requesting loans.           We know pretty&#13;
&#13;
                   much ldlat the attitude of the Fund is.         Where do we stand in relation to&#13;
&#13;
                   that?   To what extent do we f'ollow?&#13;
&#13;
BEYEN:             May I say a word. off the record?&#13;
&#13;
                   We all recall 1931 when England went off the gold stan:ia.rd., how people thought&#13;
&#13;
                   at the beginning.    We well know that the Bank of International Settlements&#13;
&#13;
                   was based on the principle that all members should be on the gold standard,&#13;
&#13;
                   and there was a very curious consequence of that which I might only mention&#13;
&#13;
                   as sounding a note of caution.        Sweden, as you know, f'ollowed Great Britain.&#13;
&#13;
                   Great Britain had an ex-officio director on the Board of the Bank of Inter-&#13;
&#13;
                   national Settlements.    The SWedish director on the other hand was elected,&#13;
&#13;
                   and when his re-election came up in 1932 or 1933 he was not re-elected,&#13;
&#13;
                   because he lfas not gold standard.          He was only re-elected in 19.37 after&#13;
&#13;
                   every body with the exception of' Albania had gone off the gold starrlard..&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:          Certainly we cannot be precipitate.&#13;
&#13;
VARVARESSOS :      It lfould be unfortunate.   Albania did not own anything but gold coins.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRllAN:         still on the gold stan:ia.rd..&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI a         Real gold standard.&#13;
&#13;
DE CARMOY:         I should like to say a word. in connection with the French monetary reform&#13;
&#13;
                   and its relations with the Monetary Fund.           I do not think the question will&#13;
&#13;
                   becoming f'orth in any soort time of France being ineligible to use the Fund's&#13;
&#13;
                   resources or the fact that such action will be considered.           This for two&#13;
&#13;
                   reasons.     The first reason is that France has used the entire account of&#13;
&#13;
                   its quota that it can use.        I should not like to be misunderstood - France&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    - 66Jl -&#13;
&amp;#12;DEÂ·v.tlRJ4)Y:   has used 96% of w.hat she   was   able to draw during twelve months, after the&#13;
(Cont'd)&#13;
                first drawing, and the first drawing took place in May; in other words,&#13;
&#13;
                France will not ask anything until this coming }lay.    Now the second point&#13;
&#13;
                is this, it should be very doubtfuJ. if' France would ask for new drawings&#13;
&#13;
                on the Fund without having informal talks as to what the answer might be.&#13;
&#13;
                It seems to be doubtful after the press release Mr. Gutt made two or three&#13;
&#13;
                days ago that the Fund would take steps to declare France ineligible before&#13;
&#13;
                France vould make a request for drawings.       I think we are at a standstill&#13;
&#13;
                for certainly several months and therefore there is no haste and we have&#13;
&#13;
                plenty of time to think the matter over and have informal discussions on&#13;
&#13;
                the subject.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIR1IAN:      I want to say this; I think one of the happy elements in this rather un-&#13;
&#13;
                fortunate situation is the apparent good temper shown on the part of every-&#13;
&#13;
                body connected with it.     The tone of the comments fran London I thought were&#13;
&#13;
                very moderate and sympathetic, am I think the Fund acted with great temper-&#13;
&#13;
                ance, am I think everybody appreciates on the other hand the very difficult&#13;
&#13;
                position that France was in.       A good bit of this discussion is perhaps aca-&#13;
&#13;
                demic to any particular action that the Bank may take, but consequences&#13;
&#13;
                reach out so far when we have to consider the general economy of these situ-&#13;
&#13;
                ations, that the more we know about it and the possible effects the better.&#13;
&#13;
                Certainly I feel very ignorant about it and want to be as lieU informed as&#13;
&#13;
                I can be, and we will try to keep the Board fully aware of the thinking in&#13;
&#13;
                the staff, as well as the thinking in the Fund so far as we can gather it.&#13;
&#13;
                It is the general, if' I may just say what the state of my thinking is, I&#13;
&#13;
                am concerned whether this is going to be stabilization or money anarchy.&#13;
&#13;
                France has devalued her franc.       Now that is good presumably, or most people&#13;
&#13;
                seem to think it is good.     I u:rx1erstood the Fund did not object to devalu-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  - 6&amp;-&#13;
&amp;#12;CIt._..:rlM.AN :   ation of the franc as such.   The question of the free market and 'the further&#13;
(Conttd)&#13;
                   devaluation of the dollars in relation to the franc, that introduces some&#13;
&#13;
                   greater questions.   The general stimulant, to French e:x;ports to the United&#13;
&#13;
                   states, and, as I see it, a general discouragement of purchase of ~ssential&#13;
&#13;
                   imports from the United states certainly 11111 prove favorable for France.&#13;
&#13;
                   The question is, does it move unfavorably for other countries and to what&#13;
&#13;
                   exten~J   and to what extent does that produce a generally confused situation&#13;
&#13;
                   throughout Europe, which is in such need of general confidence in relation&#13;
&#13;
                   to the currency situation.    AM it is that phase of it that I am concerned&#13;
&#13;
                   about.    I think also we have to think about what effect the action of one&#13;
&#13;
                   of the members has upon the standing of - the adverse action of one of the&#13;
&#13;
                   members has upon the position of - the Fund as a stabilizing influence.&#13;
&#13;
                   The Bretton Woods institutions are tied together in people's minds, any 1m-&#13;
&#13;
                   pairment of the authority, of the prestige, of one reflects upon the other&#13;
&#13;
                   to some degree.    Time probably can only give the answer to the f"irst question&#13;
&#13;
                   that I raised.&#13;
&#13;
VARVARESSOS :      I do not intend to inquire into the meti ts of the policy which one big&#13;
&#13;
                   member of the Bank has followed.    On the other hand, I do not think we&#13;
&#13;
                   must allow ourselves to be satisfied that the undoubtedly unfortunate&#13;
&#13;
                   position which has been created has not developed more critically.       On&#13;
                   the whole, we are left with a not very satisfactory feeling.     I think we&#13;
&#13;
                   camot ignore two aspects of all this.     The first is that one very 1m-&#13;
&#13;
                   portant member of the Bank has decided to follOW' a national policy.     At&#13;
&#13;
                   the same time, other important members of the Bank thought this policy&#13;
&#13;
                   might disburb their own exchange positions.    At Bretton Woods we had&#13;
&#13;
                   hoped that we had agreed upon a means whereby we could try and make a&#13;
&#13;
                   compromise, come to decisions which 'WOuld not give this appearance of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 66) -&#13;
&amp;#12;v.r .\RESSOS :   dif.ference o.f opinion which no one could dleck.    So now we .fail. to do so&#13;
&#13;
                 and it is unfortunate, and unfortunate at the present stage.       We all. had&#13;
&#13;
                 the pride that our two institutions which had material means to impose&#13;
&#13;
                 their policies could do so.   It isÂ· not as if we were an ITO or a Food and&#13;
&#13;
                 Agricultural Conmdssion, but an international body for consultation. We&#13;
&#13;
                 are   a very responsible institution mo have means in our power, and we&#13;
&#13;
                 have failed, there is no doubt about that.    The second is the fact you&#13;
&#13;
                 have mentioned.   I have followed some of the Foreign Relations Committee&#13;
&#13;
                 Hearings and I was really concerned, I think it is net exaggerated to say&#13;
&#13;
                 it was terrifying, when I saw the importance which they have given to&#13;
&#13;
                 the fact of integration of the Western European countries.       I was very&#13;
&#13;
                 much afraid and am afraid that integration is an illusion.       We have to&#13;
&#13;
                 deal with the probl.ems of four or .five years.     It is out o.f possibility&#13;
&#13;
                 that we can hope that this year will see stability.       The probl.ems are so&#13;
&#13;
                 tremendous.   We hope at least to start y,1.th the coordination of pollcies&#13;
&#13;
                 and the fact is that we haven't even that.     When a measure is taken, the&#13;
&#13;
                 result is not so disastrous am vi tal as we might anticipate, because all&#13;
&#13;
                 people have shown some prudence, bilt it is not enou{#l.     I think we cannot&#13;
&#13;
                 put aside this question, independently of whether we can do sanething and&#13;
&#13;
                 whether it will be possible to do something.      I think these two aspects must&#13;
&#13;
                 be considered very seriously, because otherwise the whole conception of&#13;
&#13;
                 international coll.aboration might be shaken.     So I think it ldll be rather&#13;
&#13;
                 important - I know it is disagreeable, because we have to deal with countries&#13;
&#13;
                 'Who have done so mteh for the world recovery.      I do not think it does harm&#13;
&#13;
                 i f we discuss and have an exchange of views.&#13;
&#13;
                 I do not propose to say qthing on the substance of the matter being dis-&#13;
&#13;
                 cussed, but I just wanted to ask Whether there was some misunderstanding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 66h -&#13;
&amp;#12;                here as to the position of the Fund.        As a matter of fact, it is automatic,&#13;
&#13;
                that, under the Articles of Agreement of the Fund, France is ineligible to&#13;
&#13;
                use the resources of the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:       Not automatically.       If a member fails to fulfill any of its obligations&#13;
&#13;
                "the Fund may, after given reasonable notice to the member, declare it&#13;
&#13;
                ineligible to use the resources of the Fund" (Art. V sec. 5)&#13;
&#13;
MADAN;          No, in this case it is Article IV sec.       6 which applies: "If a member changes&#13;
                the par value of its currency despite the objection of the Fund, the member&#13;
&#13;
                shall be ineligible to use the resources of the Fund unless the Fund other-&#13;
&#13;
                wise determines".&#13;
&#13;
BEYEN:          Th.a:t only c01lleS to us as ineligible to use the Fund in respect to a new loan.&#13;
&#13;
V!RVARESSOS :   Not quite.       The question of supervision of the existing loan â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
BEYEN:          No   suspen~ion     on our side.   I thoroughly agree the question is important.&#13;
&#13;
                I 1hink   11'6   all appreciate your bringing it up, Mr. Chairman, and we are all&#13;
&#13;
                looking fonrard to the findings of the staff.        SuperviSion is the business&#13;
&#13;
                of the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
VARVARESSOS:    Our loan.&#13;
&#13;
BEIEN:          Nothing to do with superviSion of our loan.&#13;
&#13;
 ARV&#13;
V ARESSOS I     Yes.   Let us forget that the question is France.        Call it Ruritania.   Policy&#13;
&#13;
                "Which not only affects other members but in itself brings about. rerults which&#13;
&#13;
                we   do not hope for France, t.he position of the Bank is rather difficult be-&#13;
&#13;
                cause we must inquire what the effect.s are on balance of payments and the&#13;
&#13;
                policy of the country, am the possibilit.y of the country making repayments.&#13;
&#13;
                Very great interest to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BEYEN:          Great. interest to us, but I do not see where supervision comes in.&#13;
&amp;#12;C!-.   lIAN:   You two are not using "supervision" in the same sense.       The effect of this&#13;
&#13;
               action on the integrity of our loan we have to consider.           Does   aI1Â¥bo~   have&#13;
&#13;
               a.n;y other comments?    .Anybody' in the staff want to comment?    Mr. Hill?&#13;
&#13;
HILL:          I do not know that we have had sufficient opportunity to examine all the&#13;
&#13;
               facts of this" to reach arv conclusion.&#13;
&#13;
PARKINSON:     I think it should be added that" in effect" France has       reco~Bed        that her&#13;
&#13;
               action is an infringement of the Bretton Woods AgreenBnts" by making it verr&#13;
&#13;
               clear that she is anxious to bring this tenporary situation to a satisfactory&#13;
&#13;
               conclusion.    The Fund has emphasized that the door is not closed, by taJking"&#13;
&#13;
               in its statement" of further and continued consultation with France" to work&#13;
&#13;
               out what should ultimately be a flat across-tr..e-board devaluation agreed to&#13;
&#13;
               by the Fund.       I think it is necessary to say that am not to let aIry impression&#13;
&#13;
               remain that there is a complete and total cleavage between the Fund and its&#13;
&#13;
               Member, or" in fact" between other members of the institutions.             You said&#13;
&#13;
               that   y~urseli"    Mr. Chairman, by tal.king about the manner in wbich negotiations&#13;
&#13;
               has been continued, the forbearance and the tolerance which had prevailed.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:      I simply want to say in closing that I think I subscribe to what Mr.&#13;
               Varvaressos said, that is an extremely important point, the matter of inter-&#13;
&#13;
               national collaboration 1ihi.ch has been put in some jeopardy.         We cannot avoid&#13;
&#13;
               it, we cannot flunk it.       'When national interests intervene, there is a verr&#13;
&#13;
               tenuous adherence to the international concept and it is up to institutions&#13;
&#13;
               such as the Bank and the Fund to keep that flag flying and to do all we can&#13;
&#13;
               to preserve that symbol and that attitude.       At some stage I have no doubt the&#13;
&#13;
               inte gri ty of this orgarization will be tested and if we can meet it with as&#13;
&#13;
               good temper and sound approach as the Fund, or even on a better baSiS, wby&#13;
&#13;
               we would be fortunate, and anything we can do to prepare ourselves for that&#13;
               eventuality we ought to do.       That is the only thought I can really conclude&#13;
&#13;
               with.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 666-&#13;
&amp;#12;cr    -mlAN,   There are one or two things that I wish to make a couple of announcements&#13;
(t. __,t td)&#13;
               about.&#13;
&#13;
               I spoke the last time about some representatives coming from Brazil to talk&#13;
&#13;
               about that pending loan, possible loan to Brazil, or to a national of Brazil.&#13;
&#13;
               Thus far representatives have not arrived, although the Brazilian Ambassador&#13;
&#13;
               told me they were about to arrive.&#13;
&#13;
               Chile, I think there is nothing new to report.    We have talked to one of the&#13;
&#13;
               offic ial5, Chilean officials, who is on his way down to Chile now on this&#13;
&#13;
               question of the position of the Bank in relation to the security of the loan.&#13;
&#13;
               Poland, I think there is nothing new that I can report yet.    Staff is studying&#13;
&#13;
               a reply that we received from Poland, have not come to conclusions on it yet.&#13;
&#13;
               The other loan discussions which are going on, quite a number oJ: inquiries of&#13;
&#13;
               one sort or another, some very interesting, but nothing in thEi nature of an&#13;
&#13;
               application or indeed anything which I think is worth while bringing to your&#13;
&#13;
               attention, but there are some suggestions that have been made in connection&#13;
&#13;
               with development loans that I hope will develop:.   Very intriguing.&#13;
&#13;
MUNRO:         Before we close, may I make one suggestion, which is as follows:       That as&#13;
&#13;
               time goes on we find, I do certainly more and more, people are beginning to&#13;
&#13;
               be worried about how long the present boom is likely to continue in this&#13;
&#13;
               country.   All the old reports are beginning to reappear, as they did on a&#13;
&#13;
               previous occasion, but fundamentally the circumstances are dif.ferent to what&#13;
&#13;
               they were on that last major previous occasion.     I would like to suggest that&#13;
&#13;
               it would be very valuable to us to have our Research I2partment prepare a&#13;
&#13;
               paper for circulation to the Board, setting out the situation and giving         UB,&#13;
&#13;
               as .far as imponderables permit, some view on the subject.    We would appreciate&#13;
&#13;
               that.    I will probably get hit in the back by the Research Department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             - 6fl/ -&#13;
&amp;#12;CJ.1AIRMAN:          I think that is part of the Research Department 1 s job, as well as to examine&#13;
&#13;
                     into the status of the potential borrowers, we ought to take a look at the&#13;
&#13;
                     status of the potential leniet'.   Mr. Rist, is there any reason ..my you can-&#13;
&#13;
                     not undertake it?&#13;
&#13;
RIST:                I am quite sure nobody expects us to do any crystal gazing.    We shall be&#13;
&#13;
                     delighted to measure some of the elements, and perhaps appreciate their&#13;
&#13;
                     relative value.&#13;
&#13;
MUNRO:               That is what I had in mind.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:            A good many things extant on it now.    Very interesting.   I think the attitude&#13;
&#13;
                     in Washington is different to that in the rest of the country, from what I&#13;
&#13;
                     have seen.   The rest of the country is sanewhat nervous about things.     I was&#13;
&#13;
                     fascinated by a talk I had with Geoffrey Crowther    yeste~   at our luncheon.&#13;
&#13;
                     There is a queer switch that seems to go on in the economist I s thinking.&#13;
&#13;
                     Difficult for a novice in this field to follow it.    I remember it was not&#13;
&#13;
                     very long ago that people were thinking that they must not tie themselves&#13;
&#13;
                     too closely to the American economy because the American econom;y was given&#13;
&#13;
                     to these kaleidoscopic changese&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:            It was printed in the nEconomist ll as I said yesterday.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIR14A.N:          That it was a terrible thing to be tied to that and dragged dawn. I found&#13;
&#13;
                     Mr. Crowther pulling hard for an American depression as a means    to keep&#13;
                     Europe up.   It gives me some comfort â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
BEYEN:               The solution is this.   There should be an American depression   as   long as&#13;
&#13;
                     Europe has to buy from the United States, and an American boom as soon as&#13;
&#13;
                     Europe has things to sell.&#13;
