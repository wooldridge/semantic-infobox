Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s human development achievements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Bangladesh performed better than expected since independence in 1971&#13;
ï&#130;§ It will partially achieve MDGs for poverty reduction and primary enrolment, and is on track for gender&#13;
  parity in education, child mortality, maternal health, HIV/AIDs and tuberculosis&#13;
ï&#130;§ This resulted from attention to health outcomes, primary education, family planning, and gender&#13;
  equality (especially in education and workforce participation), supported by female grass-roots&#13;
  workers and organizers mobilized by the GoB and world-leading NGOs&#13;

&#13;
ï&#130;§ Jobs top the development agenda in Bangladesh&#13;
   o Labor force growing by 3.1 percent per year&#13;
   o Output per worker nearly four times higher in industry, services vs. agriculture&#13;
       o 45% of workforce in agriculture (which contributes 20% of GDP)&#13;
       o 34% in services (contributes 50% of GDP)&#13;
       o 20% in industry (contributes 30% of GDP)&#13;
   o 21m people projected to enter work force 2015-2025&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;§ Effective public policy needed to help create jobs with higher value&#13;
  addition in the economy by:&#13;
   o Removing binding constraints to growth&#13;
   o Promoting conditions for strong private sector-led growth job creation&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;§ SCD identifies priority areas of action for policymakers:&#13;
   o Transformational Priorities: key public policy areas where concerted action over&#13;
     next 3-5 years could have marked impact on progress toward twin goals&#13;
   o Foundational Priorities: pre-requisites for faster job creation and growth--areas&#13;
     where Bangladesh has done generally well and must sustain that progress&#13;

            Bangladesh - Creating more and better jobs
            for poverty reduction
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Bangladesh performed better than
            expected since independence in 1971. It will partially
            achieve MDGs for poverty reduction and primary enrolment,
            and is on track for gender parity in education, child
            mortality, maternal health, HIV/AIDs and tuberculosis. This
            resulted from attention to health outcomes, primary
            education, family planning, and gender equality (especially
            in education and workforce participation), supported by
            female grass-roots workers and organizers mobilized by the
            GoBand world-leading NGOs.
