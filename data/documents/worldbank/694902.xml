OIL INSTITUTION BUILDING PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
Country and Sector Background&#13;
Georgia is a country of 5.4 million people bounded by the Black Sea, Armenia, Azerbaijan,&#13;
Turkey and Russia. It has played a historic role as a transit country between Asia and Europe and its&#13;
independence in 1991 reopened the country's transit possibilities. Until 1994, Georgia's political&#13;
instability did not allow the realization of that potential, but the conclusion of a cease-fire in the&#13;
Abkhazian separatist dispute in that year marked a sharp improvement in the political and economic&#13;
situation which has been sustained. This increased stability has focussed attention on Georgia as one&#13;
possible outlet for the huge oil reserves of the Caspian region.&#13;
On October 9, 1995, it was announced that Georgia would be one of two transit countries&#13;
(along with Russia) for "Early Oil" from the first phase of exploitation of crude petroleum under the&#13;
Caspian Sea by the Azerbaijan International Operating Company (AIOC), a consortium of 12 oil&#13;
companies.' The Georgian International Oil Corporation (GIOC) was created on November 11, 1995&#13;
as a state-owned enterprise to act as AIOC's counterpart in Georgia.&#13;
AIOC will finance the investment in transit facilities for Early Oil through Georgia, which&#13;
involves creating a continuous pipeline from Baku2, Azerbaijan to Supsa on the Georgian Black Sea&#13;
coast. This requires rehabilitation of existing pipelines, construction of some new stretches of&#13;
pipeline, and construction of an oil storage depot and tanker terminal at Supsa.3 The capacity of this&#13;
pipeline is estimated to be about 5 million metric tonnes a year. Early Oil is expected to begin&#13;
flowing through the pipeline by end-1998. The investment in Early Oil facilities is subject to a&#13;
Pipeline Construction and Operating Agreement (PCOA) concluded between GIOC and the&#13;
shareholders of AIOC (signed on March 8, 1996).&#13;
GIOC has been conceded the use of existing facilities, which it has in turn conceded to AIOC&#13;
(under the PCOA).4 GIOC will also provide liaison services between AIOC and the Government of&#13;
Georgia. In return for conceding those facilities and providing those services, GIOC will receive&#13;
tariff income from AIOC. In addition, GIOC is earning income, in advance of Early Oil, through the&#13;
transport of oil equipment for AIOC and of crude oil of Georgian origin. GIOC is also obliged by&#13;
the PCOA inter alia to participate in an environmental impact assessment, develop a safety&#13;
'I    AIOC is a joint venture of Amoco, BP, Delta Nimir, Statol, Exxon, Itochu, Lukoil, Pennzoil, Ramco,&#13;
State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic, Turkiye Petrolleri A.O., and Unocal. AIOC has a Production&#13;
Sharing Agreement, signed on September 20, 1994, for development of the Main Azeri Oil and Chirag oil fields&#13;
and the deep water portion of the Guneshli field.&#13;
2/    The commencement of the pipeline would be at Sangachali, approximately 50 kilometers from Baku.&#13;
3/    An environmental impact assessment is underway. Once it has been completed, the design of the&#13;
pipeline, Supsa terminal and environmental mitigation systems will be subject to Georgian Government&#13;
approval.&#13;
4/    The existing facilities conceded to AIOC include the oil pipeline from Samgori (near Tbilisi) to Supsa&#13;
(on the Black Sea coast) and associated pump stations etc. (as defined in the PCOA).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
monitoring system for the pipeline, and approve AIOC's pipeline construction plans.&#13;
In the first year of its existence, GIOC has developed significant capacity, but much remains&#13;
to be done if Georgia is to realize its full potential as a transit country. In particular, Georgia is one&#13;
of the transit options for major export pipelines, i.e. development of large-scale export from the&#13;
Caspian region beyond Early Oil. AIOC is currently studying a number of major export pipeline&#13;
routes and is expected to recommend a subset of these to its shareholders by mid-1997 for further&#13;
analysis and possible negotiations. In addition, other oil developers in the region - such as Chevron&#13;
developing the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan - are considering Georgia as one of their transit options.5&#13;
However, substantial institution building will be needed if GIOC is to provide the Government of&#13;
Georgia the technical support it needs in any negotiations for a major export pipeline.&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
The objective of the proposed project is to enhance the capacity of Georgian personnel to&#13;
undertake international negotiations in respect of oil pipeline transit. This will improve Georgia's&#13;
ability to benefit from oil development in the Caspian Region by attracting private investment in the&#13;
necessary transport infrastructure. Such capacity-building will include financial, commercial,&#13;
engineering, environmental and legal aspects. This objective is to be achieved through on-the-job&#13;
training, formal training courses, and advisory services.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
The project consists of four components:&#13;
(a)    a feasibility study (by international consultants collaborating with&#13;
Georgian counterparts) of a major oil export pipeline from Baku,&#13;
Azerbaijan to Supsa, Georgia and of related terminal and storage&#13;
facilities at Supsa. This study is intended to provide on-the-job&#13;
training to Georgian personnel in project economics, pipeline tariff&#13;
determination, environmental audit, legal review, project management&#13;
and project financing, in order to enhance Georgian capacity to&#13;
negotiate transit terms with private investors 6.&#13;
(b)    a training fund to finance Georgian participation in formal training&#13;
courses in Georgia and abroad, and on-the-job training in international&#13;
companies in the oil industry. Such courses would include: (i)&#13;
pipeline transport economics (including principles of taxation); (ii)&#13;
international contract negotiation skills; (iii) environmental impact&#13;
assessment (including stakeholder analysis and public consultation);&#13;
(iv) legal principles of transcountry pipeline construction &amp; operation;&#13;
(v) principles of oil accounting, general accounting and auditing; (vi)&#13;
project financing; (vii) oil marketing; and (viii) oil industry English&#13;
language.&#13;
5/    Chevron has already concluded an agreement with Georgia and Azerbaijan for the transport of oil to be&#13;
shipped across the Caspian, and then conveyed by rail from Baku to Batumi, Georgia.&#13;
6/    The cost of the study will be lower insofar as information from parallel studies conducted by AIOC and&#13;
Turkey (the latter under Bank financing) is made available to GIOC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
(c)    negotiations advisors to provide specialized legal and financial advice&#13;
prior to and during negotiations for oil transit, as well as to assist in&#13;
preparing related contractual documents.&#13;
(d)    proiect management services to be provided in kind by GIOC7.&#13;
The total project cost is estimated at US$ 1.5 million, financed by the proposed credit of&#13;
US$ 1.4 million equivalent, and by a contribution in kind for project management from GIOC to an&#13;
estimated value of US$ 100,000.&#13;
Project Implementation&#13;
Implementation Responsibilities. The Ministry of Finance will represent the Borrower, the&#13;
Republic of Georgia, and will onlend the proceeds of the credit to GIOC. The project will be&#13;
implemented by GIOC in its function as technical support agency for the Government in its&#13;
negotiations for oil transit through Georgia. The Executive Director of GIOC, as project manager,&#13;
will oversee project implementation; procurement and management of consultants will be his direct&#13;
responsibility, while disbursement, accounting, and loan repayment will be managed by the Finance&#13;
Department of GIOC.&#13;
Terms of Reference. Terms of reference for the feasibility study have been prepared by&#13;
GIOC, with the assistance of Bank staff, and are available in the project files (and are summarized in&#13;
Annex 4). The terms of reference emphasize the need for close involvement by GIOC counterparts in&#13;
the work of the consultants, in order that the primary objective of on-the-job training is achieved.&#13;
Terms of reference for the negotiations advisors have been drafted, and will be finalized once the&#13;
scope of the negotiations becomes clear.' An indicative training program has been prepared for&#13;
financing from the training fund, and will be finalized after the consultants conducting the feasibility&#13;
study have undertaken a detailed training needs assessment of GIOC.&#13;
Procurement. The selection process for all consulting, advisory and training services will be&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by&#13;
the World Bank as Executing Agency" (August 1981). No goods procurement is provided for under&#13;
the credit. Procurement arrangements are summarized in Annex 3. All letters of invitation and all&#13;
contracts will be subject to prior review by IDA (except those related to consultants' contracts below&#13;
US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals). The Letter of Invitation for the consultants to&#13;
undertake the feasibility study has already been issued in view of the need for expeditious preparation&#13;
for oil transit negotiations, which is associated with the pace of oil development in the region.&#13;
Disbursement. Disbursements against the proposed credit are expected to be for 100 percent&#13;
of the cost of services. Payments on contracts below US$ 100,000 for firms and US$ 50,000 for&#13;
individuals may be made using Statements of Expenditure (SOEs); all other payments will be made by&#13;
direct payment procedure through the Credit Account, and withdrawal applications will be fully&#13;
documented. In order to expedite urgent payments to be made locally, a Special Account with a&#13;
'/    The GIOC contribution will include support services, office facilities and the provision of maps, aerial&#13;
photographs and other data.&#13;
s/    The scope and the timing of negotiations is primarily at the initiative of the potential investors. Such&#13;
negotiations could however commence as early as mid-1997; the main focus of the negotiations would be the&#13;
terms of oil transit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ceiling of US$ 100,000 will be established by the Borrower in a bank acceptable to IDA.&#13;
Applications for replenishment will be submitted monthly or when one-third of the amount has been&#13;
withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. Documentation requirements for replenishment will follow&#13;
standard Bank procedure as described in Chapter 6 of the Disbursement Handbook. Monthly bank&#13;
statements which have been reconciled by GIOC will accompany all disbursement requests.&#13;
Onlending.   Funds would be onlent in US$ by the Ministry of Finance to the Georgian&#13;
International Oil Corporation for 10 years, including a 3-year grace period, at a fixed rate equal to&#13;
7%, and repayable in local currency at the exchange rate prevailing as of the date of repayment.&#13;
Accounting and Auditing. The project manager will be responsible for ensuring that the&#13;
Finance Department of GIOC maintains project accounts in accordance with Bank guidelines on&#13;
financial reporting. The Special Account, project accounts, SOEs and GIOC's company accounts will&#13;
be audited by suitably qualified independent auditors acceptable to IDA; audit reports will be&#13;
submitted to IDA within six months of the end of each financial year. The audit reports will include&#13;
a statement verifying that the amounts disbursed against SOEs have been used for the purpose&#13;
intended.&#13;
Reporting. The project manager will submit to IDA a progress report on the project every&#13;
three months. This report will detail all project and related activities, report on progress in relation to&#13;
agreed schedules, and identify any problems which may have been encountered.&#13;
The expected timing of reporting by the consultants undertaking the feasibility study is as&#13;
follows:&#13;
Draft Inception Report:           within 4 weeks of contract effectiveness&#13;
Review of Inception Report9:      within 2 weeks of submission of the report&#13;
Final Inception Report:           within 2 weeks of review meeting&#13;
Draft Final Feasibility Report:   within 6 months of contract effectiveness&#13;
Review of Draft Final Feasibility&#13;
Report9:                          within 1 month of submission of the report&#13;
Final Feasibility Report:         within 1 month of review meeting&#13;
The Inception Report should contain a summary of the consultants' review of all existing&#13;
reports made available by GIOC, and identification of technically viable and environmentally&#13;
sustainable options for the proposed pipeline. The Feasibility Report should contain optimization&#13;
studies of routes, environmental audit, technical and economic analysis, tariff models, legal and&#13;
regulatory review, and a recommended training program for GIOC personnel.&#13;
Supervision. IDA supervision missions are expected to include specialists in economics, oil&#13;
engineering, environmental analysis, and law. Approximately 45 staff weeks will be required for&#13;
supervision over the 3-year lifetime of the project.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
Closing Date. The project activities are expected to be completed by mid-1999; although the&#13;
feasibility study should be completed by late-1997 and the training by mid-1998, the negotiations&#13;
advisors may be required until mid-1999. The closing date of the proposed credit is therefore&#13;
December 31, 1999.&#13;
Project Sustainability&#13;
The proposed project is intended primarily to build capacity to undertake negotiations related&#13;
to a major oil export pipeline from Baku to Supsa. However, Early Oil agreements contain periodic&#13;
renegotiation clauses, and other oil and gas transit projects through Georgia are under consideration;&#13;
the capacity built by the proposed project would therefore have spinoffs for later negotiations. The&#13;
identification of a key counterpart institution, GIOC, for the project will increase the sustainability of&#13;
the proposed project.&#13;
Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement&#13;
The implementation experience of the Georgia Institution Building and Structural Adjustment&#13;
Technical Assistance Credits (Credit No. 2641 and 2847, approved July 5, 1994 and April 18, 1996&#13;
respectively) shows the value of timely institution building assistance in Georgia. However,&#13;
experience of advisory services provided at very short notice for Early Oil negotiations under the&#13;
Institution Building Credit demonstrates the risk that political factors can sometimes supersede&#13;
technical advice; this suggests that sustained involvement of advisors at all stages of preparation and&#13;
actual conduct of negotiations is needed to mitigate that risk. Lessons learned from comparable&#13;
projects elsewhere demonstrate the importance of selecting internationally-reputable consultants using&#13;
Bank competitive procedures and of the implementing agency being fully committed to the project.&#13;
Agreed Actions&#13;
Prior to Board presentation, the Government of Georgia provided evidence, satisfactory to&#13;
IDA, that the Government of Azerbaijan has no objection to the conduct of the feasibility study.&#13;
Prior to effectiveness of the proposed credit, the Government and GIOC will sign an implementation&#13;
agreement. Prior to commencement of each training course or job placement under the training&#13;
component, GIOC will provide IDA for review a description of such courses/placements with the&#13;
curriculum vitae of the proposed candidates.&#13;
Environmental Aspects and Participatory Approach&#13;
In accordance with OD 4.01, the proposed project has been classified as Category C, since it&#13;
involves only institution building. However, the project places strong emphasis on building capacity&#13;
in environmental analysis and dissemination of environmental information.'" The feasibility study&#13;
includes an environmental audit to identify the key environmental issues in Georgia in order that&#13;
GIOC can evaluate the environmental impact assessment that any pipeline investors would be required&#13;
IO/ This will be carried out in parallel with the ongoing Institutional Development Fund grant for strengthening&#13;
Institutional Capacity for Environmental and Natural Resource Management and the Global Environment&#13;
Facility for Integrated Coastal Zone Management under the Black Sea Environmental Program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
to undertake (see Annex 4). It also places emphasis on assessing market potential in Black Sea&#13;
countries, in view of the environmental constraints on shipping oil through the Bosphorus." The&#13;
training fund supplements the on-the-job training of the feasibility study with formal training in&#13;
environmental impact assessment, and provides for training in stakeholder analysis and public&#13;
consultation in order to maximize public participation in environmental decision-making. In addition,&#13;
the feasibility study provides for a review of the legal and regulatory issues pertaining to&#13;
environmental considerations, and such issues will be included within the terms of reference of the&#13;
negotiations advisors.&#13;
II/ The Government of Turkey has repeatedly expressed concerns over the environmental implications of&#13;
increasing volumes of oil shipped through the Bosphorus.&#13;

ANNEX 4&#13;
BAKU - SUPSA MAJOR OIL EXPORT PIPELINE&#13;
FEASIBILITY STUDY - SUMMARY OF THE TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Georgia is under consideration by private investors as one of a number of possible transit&#13;
countries for crude oil to be transported by pipeline from Baku, Azerbaijan. Two options for&#13;
Georgian transit are currently under review (transit through various combinations of Armenia, Iran,&#13;
Russia, and Turkey is also under consideration). One route from Baku through the Tbilisi area to&#13;
Ceyhan (on the Turkish Mediterranean coast) is to be studied under a World Bank loan to Turkey&#13;
(Baku-Ceyhan Oil Export Pipeline TA Project); other routes from Baku to Ceyhan may also be&#13;
studied under that loan. The other route, from Baku through the Tbilisi area to Supsa (on Georgia's&#13;
Black Sea coast) would be the subject of the proposed study, to be financed by an IDA credit to&#13;
Georgia. The proposed study would also consider the related oil storage depot and tanker terminal at&#13;
Supsa.'5&#13;
The proposed feasibility study aims to provide on-the-job training for Georgian personnel in&#13;
the economic and technical evaluation of pipeline options in order to build capacity in international&#13;
contract negotiations. In this regard, the consultants shall: (a) evaluate environmentally sound options&#13;
and recommend the most cost-effective routing through Georgia for the proposed pipeline, its size and&#13;
all associated facilities; (b) prepare budgetary cost estimates based on the recommended route and&#13;
conceptual design; (c) identify the best-suited location for the proposed pipeline terminal at Supsa and&#13;
prepare its conceptual design and budgetary cost estimates; (d) develop recommendations on the&#13;
pipeline tariff model; (e) identify training needs for GIOC personnel concerning pipeline and terminal&#13;
operations; and (f) undertake a legal and regulatory review.&#13;
The scope of work for each section should cover, but not be limited to, the following.&#13;
Pipeline:&#13;
(a)  Review all existing studies and technical data made available and prepare recommendations&#13;
regarding environmentally-sound options for route, capacity, pumping arrangements and&#13;
associated facilities for transporting export oil, beyond the early oil export, through a Baku-&#13;
Supsa pipeline.&#13;
(b)  Carry out route survey indicating alternatives, if any, and justification for the selected option.&#13;
The survey should cover the full routing of the pipeline. The proposed rights-of-way for the&#13;
pipeline and associated facilities should be selected to minimize impact on environment and&#13;
reduce hazards to population and public property.&#13;
(c)  Review crude oil import requirements in countries around the Black Sea (particularly Romania,&#13;
Bulgaria, Ukraine and Turkey), evaluate landed cost benefit of various options for these&#13;
15f   The choice of Supsa as the terminal for a major export pipeline is conditional on environmental approval&#13;
being received for an early oil terminal at Supsa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
countries and estimate their likely requirement of crude oil ex-Supsa. Take into account such&#13;
export requirement and estimate the quantity of oil that will be routed through Supsa, over and&#13;
above the early oil.&#13;
(d)  Consider at least two sizes of the pipeline (for each throughput assumed) while determining the&#13;
number and locations of the pump stations, and calculating capital and operating costs.&#13;
(e)  Investigate various pipe coating and wrapping materials and identify the most suitable one,&#13;
indicating comparative costs and benefits.&#13;
(f)   Evaluate possible options and identify the most suitable cathodic protection system that will suit&#13;
the soil analysis results and indicate source of power supply, if required.&#13;
(g)  Evaluate different options for telecommunication facilities for monitoring crude oil flow and&#13;
measurement and for general operations and maintenance. Identify a suitable supervisory&#13;
control and data acquisition (SCADA) system.&#13;
(h)  Indicate locations for pipeline scraper launching and receiving barrels and the types best suited&#13;
for pipe cleaning.&#13;
(i)  Indicate crude oil measurement facilities, locations and type recommended.&#13;
0)   Provide details of essential items of equipment and materials.&#13;
(k)  Provide conceptual design of all branch-off junctions along the pipeline, if any.&#13;
(I)   Compare capital costs for various options studied.&#13;
(m)  Prepare a general environmental audit identifying households that will be dislocated and/or lost&#13;
access to resources due to the proposed project. Evaluate project related impacts on agricultural&#13;
land, range land, forest, water sources, and other wild lands and recommend remedial&#13;
measures. Prepare an assessment of potential oil spillage and recommend mitigating measures.&#13;
Highlight areas of delicate or special ecology, major archaeological sites and national parks.&#13;
Portions of the pipeline route susceptible to earthquake, landslide, avalanche, flooding and other&#13;
natural disasters should be identified. Assess the cost of preventive measures necessary to&#13;
reduce the impact of such natural disasters on the integrity of the pipeline system to an absolute&#13;
minimum.&#13;
It should be noted that analysis of the section of the pipeline from Baku to the Tbilisi area is&#13;
intended to be based mainly on a review of information to be provided to GIOC from the World&#13;
Bank-financed study of Baku-Ceyhan (conducted by Turkey), to the extent possible.&#13;
Supsa Oil Tanker-loading Terminal:&#13;
(a)  Review all existing data on Supsa, including undersea currents and sea bed conditions and carry&#13;
out additional tests, as necessary, to evaluate the most suitable location for the proposed&#13;
terminal from the point of view of navigational safety and environmental soundness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
(b)  Review the condition of the ocean channel for tanker approach for the selected location and the&#13;
sea bed condition for the tanker turn-table and recommend the most cost effective design for the&#13;
terminal and associated facilities, taking into account different scenarios regarding volume of&#13;
export crude from the proposed terminal, and sizes of tankers expected to be handled at the&#13;
terminal.&#13;
(c)  Review and recommend suitable safety and navigational facilities at Supsa which will match&#13;
international standards.&#13;
(d)  Review and recommend facilities for collecting ballast water from tankers at Supsa comparable&#13;
with international standards.&#13;
(e)  Review the environmental impact, as per Georgian and IDA guidelines, of oil storage and&#13;
handling operations planned for Supsa and recommend methods and facilities to minimize&#13;
environmental pollution as a result of the proposed terminal's tanker-loading operation.&#13;
(f)   Estimate the size of tanker loading facilities, storage tanks, pumps, piping and all associated&#13;
facilities required for a modern oil tanker loading terminal, suitable for the recommended&#13;
volume of crude oil handling, and prepare conceptual design to carry out reliable cost estimates.&#13;
(g)  Review the facilities, services and materials available from Georgia and take them into account&#13;
in preparing the conceptual design and cost estimates. Prepare the capital and operating costs&#13;
for the proposed terminal in such detail that the results could be directly incorporated in the&#13;
evaluation of the export pipeline economic study.&#13;
Legal and Regulatory Review:&#13;
(a)  Examine existing laws, regulations and decrees in both Azerbaijan and Georgia which directly&#13;
affect the construction of a transnational oil pipeline;&#13;
(b)  Consider the need for, and essential provisions of, international bilateral or multilateral state&#13;
agreements amongst the transit states for the harmonization of such laws, regulations; etc., to&#13;
enable the construction and operation of such an export pipeline;&#13;
(c)  Ascertain what land easement/rights of way/permits are necessary and how they would be&#13;
granted in both countries for the construction and operation of such a transnational oil pipeline,&#13;
including such easements, etc., as would be necessary for all infrastructure associated with such&#13;
a pipeline; and&#13;
(d)  Examine, in both countries, any exonerations and exemptions, either available or to be&#13;
recommended, with respect to taxes other charges associated with the construction and operation&#13;
of a transnational oil pipeline and its associated infrastructure.&#13;
Training of Georgian Personnel:&#13;
The primary objective of the proposed study is the provision of training to Georgian personnel.&#13;
The consultants shall assist GIOC in selecting suitably qualified Georgian personnel to work with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
consultants' own experts in various fields and provide adequate on the job training in conducting&#13;
different facets of pipeline studies (as described in this scope of work), such as use of&#13;
computers/specialized instruments, environmental audits, investment appraisal and pipeline tariff&#13;
modeling. The consultants shall also identify training needs concerning pipeline/terminal negotiations&#13;
and operations and recommend a suitable training program.&#13;

            The objective of the Oil Institution
            Building Project for Georgia is to enhance the capacity of
            Georgian personnel to undertake international negotiations
            in respect of oil pipeline transit.  This will improve
            Georgia's ability to benefit from oil development in
            the Caspian Region by attracting private investment in the
            necessary transport infrastructure.  The project consists of
            four components: a) a feasibility study; b) a training fund;
            c) negotiations advisors; and d) project management.
