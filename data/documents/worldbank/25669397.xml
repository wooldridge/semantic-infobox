In the mining sector, with a production of 4 million in                      after the rehabilitation and the modernization of the&#13;
2013, Gabon is among the worldâ&#128;&#153;s largest producers                           production chain of the national brewery SOBRAGA,&#13;
and exporters of manganese (Figure 6). In 2014 the                           albeit from a low base. The production of energy also&#13;
production of manganese declined by 3 percent,                               increased by 4.6 percent following the introduction&#13;
compared with 2013, following a technical incident                           of new generating capacity, via thermal power from&#13;
that restricted rail freight traffic on the Transgabonais                    Alenakiri (in the south of Libreville) and the Grand&#13;
route, the only means by which ore can be                                    Poubara hydroelectric dam (in eastern Gabon)&#13;
transported to Libreville for export. Gold production                        that have allowed the national utility concession3 to&#13;
in 2014 also declined following reduced global prices.                       meet stronger energy demand from household and&#13;

Conversely, production in the wood processing&#13;
industry increased by 10.9 percent in 2014                                   In the Agriculture sector, food and vegetable&#13;
following a better supply of logging to factories.                           production increased by 7 percent in 2014, primarily&#13;
Agro-industrial production increased by 17.2 percent                         due to higher demand from restaurants and hotels.&#13;
&#13;
Box 1: Gabonâ&#128;&#153;s Oil sector&#13;
&#13;
      Gabonâ&#128;&#153;s oil sector is made up of seven companies (Perenco Gabon, Addax Petroleum, Maurel &amp; Prom, Vaalco&#13;
      Gabon, Total Gabon, Shell Gabon, POGL) across three fields. Service activities related to the oil sector include&#13;
      logistics, drilling operations, onshore and offshore oil rig construction and maintenance. These activities are&#13;
      concentrated in the area of Port-Gentil.&#13;
      Oil production decreased between 1997 and 2002, but efforts to reverse the decline in production led to stable&#13;
      production between 2003 and 2005. Since then oil production has contracted and current oil reserves are&#13;
      estimated at 3.7 billion barrels. In August 2014, the oil and economy ministers announced seven new contracts&#13;
      for the sale of offshore blocks. These sales were expected to attract investments of around US$ 863 million&#13;
      according to the Government. However, lower oil prices since then have put planned investment in jeopardy.&#13;
      A new hydrocarbons law was adopted in 2014. It was intended to increase the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s share in and&#13;
      control over hydrocarbon resources and activities. Gabon will hold an increasingly large stake in all new&#13;
      operations for exploration and extraction, via the national Gabon Oil Company (GOC), created in 2011. The&#13;
      new law also introduces a regulatory regime for midstream and downstream activities. Oil companies (both&#13;
      senior and junior) have voiced complaints about the tax provisions of the new law, which will reduce potential&#13;
      profits, and have suggested they might reduce future investment. The industry also finds the provisions on&#13;
      the award of petroleum rights (based on competing petroleum agreements and petroleum authorizations)&#13;
      confusing, and the nature and duration of petroleum contracts and petroleum authorizations for exploration&#13;
      and production activities are not well aligned. These changes may make it harder for Gabon to realize new&#13;
      investment in the sector, but if successful, Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s share of the profits will increase.&#13;

Box 2: Public Investment&#13;
&#13;
  In order to implement the PSGE, the Government decided to raise the capital budget to US$1.54 billion&#13;
  in 2010 (representing three times the average annual budget allocated over the period 2006 to 2008) to&#13;
  address infrastructure bottlenecks. Consequently, capital expenditure which stood at 5 percent in 2008&#13;
  increased to 15 percent of GDP between 2009 and 2012. The sector distribution of the investment budget&#13;
  shows the predominance of public works and energy infrastructure, the share of which has increased from&#13;
  51 to 67 percent of the budget between 2009 and 2013. The capital spending is guided by implementation&#13;
  of a US$13 billion infrastructure masterplan adopted in 2012 for the period 2013-16. The main projects of&#13;
  the master plan include: Power â&#128;&#147; Infrastructure (US$3 billion), Transport â&#128;&#147; Infrastructure: roads, railways,&#13;
  ports (US$3.5 billion), development of the mining sector (US$3.3 billion), and development of the tourism&#13;
  sector (US$85 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
To cover its financing needs, the Government               compared to the same period in 2014&#13;
successfully issued a US$500 million Eurobond in           due to further declines of the international&#13;

Box 3: Social Protection Definition and Goals&#13;
&#13;
  Social protection and labor systems, policies, and programs help individuals and societies manage risk and&#13;
  volatility and protect them from poverty and destitutionâ&#128;&#148;through instruments that improve resilience, equity,&#13;
  and opportunity. As such, social protection and labor systems have three intertwined goals:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  1. Resilience against the impact of drops in well-being from a range of shocks. Key sources of resilience&#13;
  are social insurance programs that minimize the negative impact of economic shocks on individuals and&#13;
  familiesâ&#128;&#148;such as unemployment and disability insurance, old-age pensions, and scalable public works&#13;
  programs. Complementary programs in other sectors are also extremely important for resilienceâ&#128;&#148;such&#13;
  as crop and weather insurance and health insurance. Private and informal arrangements (such as savings,&#13;
  assets, and family or community-based support) are vital, too.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  2. Equity for the poor through protecting against destitution and promoting equality of opportunity. Social&#13;
  assistance programs (also known as safety net programsâ&#128;&#148;including cash transfers and in-kind transfers,&#13;
  such as school feeding and targeted food assistance) address chronic poverty. They also protect poor&#13;
  individuals and families from irreversible and catastrophic losses of human capital (nutrition, health, and&#13;
  education). They also lay the foundation for equality of opportunity, notably by helping families feel secure&#13;
  enough to invest in their future and their children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  3. Opportunity for all through promoting human capital in children and adults and â&#128;&#156;connectingâ&#128;&#157; men and&#13;
  women to more productive employment. Institutions that promote opportunity are often integrated with&#13;
  those supporting resilience and equity. Cash transfers incentivize investments in human capital by promoting&#13;
  demand for education and health and by helping address gender inequalities. Public works programs provide&#13;
  cash payments to the poor, while increasing physical capital investments. And labor market programs provide&#13;
  unemployment benefits, build skills, and enhance workersâ&#128;&#153; productivity and employability.&#13;

&amp;#12;Box 4: South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s Social Grant System&#13;
&#13;
    South Africa boasts the largest cash transfer program in Sub-Saharan Africa. It includes several types&#13;
    of means-tested grants targeted to the elderly, poor families with children, foster families, people with&#13;
    disabilities, and war veterans. Roughly 15 million people receive a social grant (about 30 percent of the&#13;
    national population). The child support grant (CSG) reaches about 10 million people, while the old age grant,&#13;
    which applies to poor people over 60 years of age, reaches about 2 million people. According to household&#13;
    survey data, social grants make up over 60 percent of the income of the poorest 20 percent of recipient&#13;
    households, with child grants being the largest contributor. Children who were enrolled in the CSG at birth&#13;
    completed significantly more grades of schooling and achieved higher scores on a math test than children&#13;
    who were enrolled at the age of six. These effects were particularly significant for girls. Enrollment in the CSG&#13;
    reduced the likelihood of illness among children by 9 percentage points. The main effects on adolescents&#13;
    were reduced sexual activity and teen pregnancies and less drug and alcohol use.&#13;

been utilized, although many have not proved sustainable and suffered from inadequate financing. For example, the national social guarantee structure&#13;

A more precise estimate of the poverty line and the         Ensuring Fiscal sustainability&#13;

This fits with a general and critical need for              implications and sustainability of the programs,&#13;

                                                           A good example of weak targeting is evident&#13;
The SIHG that guides the development of                    in the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s provision of scholarships&#13;

Preparation of the 2016 budget will most likely            and evaluation (M&amp;E) of the social protection&#13;

            Gabon economic update : protecting the poor
            despite slower growth
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The structure of the Gabonese economy in
            2014 reveals a strong dominance of services which account
            for 57.8 percent of real gross domestic product (GDP),
            followed by oil industry (20.6 per cent), other industries
            (15.4 per cent), and agriculture (6.3 per cent). Following
            lower oil revenues, from reduced prices and production, and
            lower non-oil revenue, the government reduced public
            expenditure from 26.7 percent of GDP in 2013 to 23.6 percent
            in 2014. Despite this, both government wages and salaries
            and goods and salaries increased leaving public investment
            to bear much of the brunt of the expenditure cuts resulting
            in only half of planned public investment being realized. In
            response to declining oil prices, the government adjusted
            the initial 2015 budget and revised the revenue assumptions.
            To cope with the financing gap, the government successfully
            issued a Eurobond of United States (U.S.) 500 million
            dollars in June 2015 with a maturity of ten years at a rate
            of 6.95 percent. Gabon has stated its intention to introduce
            a modern social protection system, however it has not yet
            reached the objectives set by the government. It still faces
            five major challenges to be addressed: (i) a lack of data;
            (ii) coordination of the system; (iii) ensuring fiscal
            sustainability; (iv) effective targeting of beneficiaries;
            and (v) building lesson-learning into policy. To meet these
            challenges the authors recommend focusing on the following:
            (a) deepen the analysis of poverty and vulnerability; (b)
            conduct an institutional audit; (c) formulate a deployment
            plan; and (d) simulate roll-out options.
