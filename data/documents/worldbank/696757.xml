            The privatization dividend : a worldwide
            analysis of the financial and operating performance of newly
            privatized firms
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The study described in this Note
            compared the pre- and post-privatization performance of 61
            companies in 18 countries and 32 industries. These companies
            were sold to the public through a share issue and thus their
            comparable pre- and post-issue financial and accounting data
            could be obtained from the firms' offering prospectuses
            and annual reports. The study tested for increased
            profitability, increased operating efficiency, increased
            capital investment spending, increased output, and
            privatization without lowering employment levels. It tested
            for these results both for the full sample and for several
            subsamples: privatizations of firms in competitive and
            non-competitive industries, full and partial privatization,
            privatization involving firms headquartered in OECD
            countries and in developing countries, and
            "control" and "revenue" privatizations.
            It showed significant increases among newly private firms in
            profitability, output per employee, capital spending, and
            employment. It also found that the financial policies of
            these firms start to resemble those typically associated
            with private entrepreneurial companies--with lower leverage
            and higher dividend payout ratios. Although the data did not
            allow precise documentation of the causes of these
            performance improvements after divestiture, the study was
            able to rule out price increases as a frequent source of
            profitability increases. It also showed that privatization
            has a positive effect on a firm's operating and
            financial performance while maintaining employment.
