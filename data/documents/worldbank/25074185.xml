&amp;#12;djj                                                                                                       1&#13;

&#13;
      The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
      fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh Kapur, The World Bank:&#13;
      Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press, 1997. It is not a formal&#13;
      oral history, and it is not a systematic overview of the work of the person interviewed. At times&#13;
      the authors discussed the planned publication itself and the sources that should be consulted; at&#13;
      other times they talked about persons and publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview&#13;
      tapes and transcripts begin and end abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group Archives&#13;
      believes that this transcript may be of interest to researchers and makes it available for public&#13;
      use.&#13;

                                         Abdul Hakim Nusantara&#13;
                                       November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;djj                                                                                                   2&#13;
      [Begin Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: INGI [International Non-Governmental Group for Indonesia], it is international&#13;
      forum of the NGOs [non-governmental organizations] from Indonesia and from IGGI [Inter-&#13;
      Governmental Group for Indonesia] member countries. You know, IGGI is . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yes, yes, yes. [Simultaneous speakers, inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: . . inter-governmental groups on Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: So, the membership of the INGI consists of Indonesian NGOs, NGOs from the&#13;
      United States, from Belgium, from the Netherlands, from Japan, and other countries who are&#13;
      members of the IGGI.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: And the purpose of this INGI is to actively influence the development aid&#13;
      policy toward Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: So the development aid policy of donor countries, including the World Bank,&#13;
      of course, will respond positively to the real needs of the poor community in this country.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: And the objective number two is to facilitate the peopleâ&#128;&#153;s participation in&#13;
      development in Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
      Then we make a conference every year, and after the conference we produce aide memoires and&#13;
      also some studies which can be used as a lobby and dialogue with the World Bank officials and&#13;
      also with development officials from IGGI member countries.&#13;
&#13;
      Last time, for example, we brought Kedung Ombo case. The Kedung Ombo case is the&#13;
      development of hydro water dams, projects, huge water dam projects, which is financially&#13;
      supported by the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: But in our view, because in that area in central Java the people who have been&#13;
      forced to give their land for these projects, they refuse, because they receive only very low&#13;
      compensation, land compensation, and also people also questioning about the benefit of such&#13;
      huge water dam projects for them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Abdul Hakim Nusantara&#13;
                                      November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;djj                                                                                                   3&#13;
      LEWIS: The compensation is small.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Itâ&#128;&#153;s very small. Itâ&#128;&#153;s about six--less than one-third of U.S. dollar for [inaudible]&#13;
      meters.&#13;
&#13;
      And we found that the World Bank fail to implement their own internal policy on involuntary&#13;
      resettlement. You see, the World Bank has internal policy on involuntary resettlement as regard&#13;
      to the implementation of World Bank financial--of projects which is financially supported by the&#13;
      World Bank. There is no active monitoring, which should be conducted by the World Bank&#13;
      officials. There is no process of consultation with affected communities. So, you see, in 1989,&#13;
      when about more than 2000 families still living in that area, the gate of this huge water dam&#13;
      projects was opened, and many people were thrown to the water.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Really.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: We make petition to the World Bank and also to the government of Indonesia,&#13;
      and then we make dialogue, and we pinpoint the negligence of the World Bank to implement&#13;
      their own--its own policy.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: How many were drowned?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Well, about--I can say about 1,000, 1,600 families.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: All drowned?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: All drowned. I mean have been in waters.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: All killed--all died?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. The land.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: No, no. But their land was . . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Oh, their land was flooded, flooded.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Not only land, but their house while they are still there . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yeah, yeah. Okay.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: . . so they are swimming.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yeah. Yes, okay.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: And then we make--finally we make peace on that experience. We developed&#13;
      regular dialogue two times a year, every six months. This is very important, first because in&#13;
      Indonesia there has been a question of accountability, accountability as regard to the government&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Abdul Hakim Nusantara&#13;
                                      November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;djj                                                                                                       4&#13;
      relationship with the World Bank. What the government of Indonesia, letâ&#128;&#153;s say, making loan&#13;
      with the World Bank or with other countries through bilateral cooperation, all this international&#13;
      economic dealing is not controlled by our parliament. The parliament does not--doesnâ&#128;&#153;t have&#13;
      knowledge about our--about government business with the World Bank. Where the parliament&#13;
      are informed is about--itâ&#128;&#153;s only, â&#128;&#156;Well, we make a loan. We still have foreign debt. We are,â&#128;&#157;&#13;
      you know. But the detail, the consequences are not sufficiently informed by the--by our&#13;
      parliament.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: How about the press? Does . . .&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Also the press. Our access to World Bank information is very limited.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Limited by the government?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: And also by the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: By the World Bank, also.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Because the World Bank always make an argument like this: â&#128;&#156;Look, all the&#13;
      informations as regard to projects proposed by the government of Indonesia to the World Bank&#13;
      are the property of the government of Indonesia, so we cannot give you information.â&#128;&#157; While if&#13;
      you are talking about people participation in development, involving people in this, in the cycles&#13;
      of the projects--planning, implementation and evaluation--information is very important.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: But we do not--we are not able to get that kind of information. So all the&#13;
      information is only known by the government and the World Bank officials.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Suppose you have a project which is--which is only a project of the government of&#13;
      Indonesia where the World Bank is not involved. Is the information available to you more or&#13;
      less?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: No.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Or is it any different?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Itâ&#128;&#153;s the same.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Itâ&#128;&#153;s the same. So in your opinion is the difficulty in obtaining information, is it the&#13;
      government of Indonesia or the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Both.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Both.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Abdul Hakim Nusantara&#13;
                                       November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;djj                                                                                                   5&#13;
      NUSANTARA: There has been kind of a--I will not say collaboration or conspiration, but I&#13;
      prefer to say mutual understanding and consensus between the two, between the World Bank and&#13;
      the government of Indonesia not to release information as regard to any project planning&#13;
      submitted to the World Bank and about the detail of--and about the implication of these projects.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Are they--I suppose you can--you get more information from projects of the Ford&#13;
      Foundation? Or not?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: From Ford Foundation? On what?&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Well, they have projects . . .&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yeah, with NGO, yes.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: NGOs, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: With NGOs itâ&#128;&#153;s no problem.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: And the Asian Development Bank?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Pardon?&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: Asian Development Bank?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Itâ&#128;&#153;s the same.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Same as the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Same as the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: And other bilateral donors, say a Japanese-aided project?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Itâ&#128;&#153;s the same.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Same. So basically . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: How about the Dutch?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: The Dutch is--I can tell you this one sad story about Dutch, although then they&#13;
      said there has been some reform inside--yeah?--inside their bilateral policy. There is one case in&#13;
      East Java; this is the development of salt factory.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Salt?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Abdul Hakim Nusantara&#13;
                                       November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;djj                                                                                                    6&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Salt, yeah? S-A-L-T. And for this project the Dutch government provide&#13;
      about 25 million guilders. And to implement this projects, it means that the government should&#13;
      take over land from the salt farmers in Madura. And those salt farmers will be employed in the&#13;
      salt factory, which is owned by the government, as laborer, which means they will be declining&#13;
      in term of income, because in the past they are master for their own.&#13;
&#13;
      Those people are not informed about the design of the projects, because the design of the project&#13;
      is made by the AKZO of the consultants in the Netherland. But when we handle this case, we&#13;
      advocate this case, we communicate also with the Netherland embassy here, and then we were&#13;
      told that the Netherland embassy, the government of the Netherland, has stopped to continue in&#13;
      financing this project. But up â&#128;&#152;til now, I could not get letter of the decision.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: To stop the . . .&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yeah. Because the decision to stop in financing this project, it must be put in&#13;
      writing, not just oral. Up â&#128;&#152;til now, I couldnâ&#128;&#153;t find that.&#13;
&#13;
      But I was told by the Dutch ambassador here that the Dutch put a policy like this: they are&#13;
      actively monitor in the implementation process, especially projects, development projects, which&#13;
      will affect the property of the communities. Letâ&#128;&#153;s say, for example, if this project need to take&#13;
      over land from the people, the Dutch government will put Dutch officials as a--supervisors&#13;
      which actively involve in implementing, in the implementation of these projects. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know&#13;
      how this active supervision is conducted in the field.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: You have not seen this, then.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: No.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: In your experience, if you look at all the World Bank projects, in which--are there any&#13;
      sectors, if any, where you think the projects are reasonable? Like, say, education? And which&#13;
      are the sectors where you think there has been more of a problem?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Uh, huge water dam project will be a problem. It has been a problem. Yeah?&#13;
      And, two . .&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Examples?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Kedung Ombo.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Is the biggest one?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yeah, the biggest one. And then, two, is--it will be a problems on the--in the&#13;
      integrated village development in Irian Jaya.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: I see.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Abdul Hakim Nusantara&#13;
                                      November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;djj                                                                                                        7&#13;
      NUSANTARA: So the government--but it has not been decided yet by the World Bank. So&#13;
      the government of Indonesia proposed for World Bank support a project which is called&#13;
      â&#128;&#156;Integrated Village Development in Irian Jaya,â&#128;&#157; where it will be a problem, first, because--you&#13;
      see, in Irian Jaya you have particular situation. The security measure is very, very high, which&#13;
      means the military play very important role than the civilian government.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: And people in Irian also are--well, what do you call it? They feel that they are&#13;
      strictly controlled.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yeah? So they are not free to talk, to travel. And, too, also about the fact that&#13;
      in Irian you have a very, very underdeveloped community--yeah?--in terms of education,&#13;
      intellectuals, intellectuality, and also skills to compete in free market. So if this kind of projects&#13;
      is implemented now, although maybe the intention is positive, it may end up nothing for the local&#13;
      people.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: So we give input to the World Bank. We said to the World Bank it is better to&#13;
      postpone until certain conditions are fulfilled, among others is to lift out the high security policy .&#13;
      .&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: . . in Irian.&#13;
&#13;
      Other projects which will--which--I donâ&#128;&#153;t know . . .&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: How was the--what is your sense of the transmigration projects?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: This is also problem in the past. Now there has been some improvement, but&#13;
      in fact my knowledge about this improvement is fairly limited. The problem in the past is this:&#13;
      because the transmigration program is designed to, only to reach a target, without considering the&#13;
      sociology, anthropology and cultural contacts of the people, both the people in the area where the&#13;
      people from Java will come and the people from Java itself. So then you have problem.&#13;
&#13;
      And, too, in that time the information regarding the land available for this transmigration project&#13;
      is very limited. So it is happened--it happened, for example, the resettlement area is in fact forest&#13;
      area which is--which has certain function, and it has just been cleared up for resettlement.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: You have problem.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Abdul Hakim Nusantara&#13;
                                        November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;djj                                                                                                        8&#13;
&#13;
      Now, the transmigration, the Department of Transmigration, developed environmental impact&#13;
      assessment procedure as aâ&#128;&#148;they thought to improve the transmigration program. Last time, the&#13;
      NGOs, some NGOs were invited to the meeting in the Department of Transmigration to discuss&#13;
      about their environmental impacts procedure. But I donâ&#128;&#153;t know how it will be implemented.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: The idea of transmigration came from the government, I guess. Is that right?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Not from the Bank, but the Bank supported it.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: The Bank supported it . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: . . because--but the problem, also, the transmigration program at that time does&#13;
      not--did not link with regional development.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Does the Bank seem to avoid projects that involve the military quite a lot? In Irian,&#13;
      evidently, it has not--or is thinking about going along with an administration thatâ&#128;&#153;s very heavily&#13;
      military. But is it--does it seem to avoid it usually, or is it--does it go along with military&#13;
      management?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Uh, you see, I donâ&#128;&#153;t think the World Bank put the military, whether the&#13;
      military will be negative factor or positive factors, in their high consideration.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: So whether the military is there or not, they . . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: [inaudible] the economics.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yeah. They will see from technical management of projects, technical&#13;
      management, from the technicality--â&#128;&#156;technicalityâ&#128;&#157; means that if this workable or not. If the&#13;
      presence of the military there will make the project efficient, the World Bank doesnâ&#128;&#153;t care,&#13;
      although it may--it is quite possible the presence of the military there creates problem for the&#13;
      local people.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Right. Youâ&#128;&#153;re head of a legal aid institute. Youâ&#128;&#153;re a lawyer, and this suggests that you&#13;
      can use the law, the courts, to get relief or help for the poor?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: To--especially for public interest casesâ&#128;&#148;yeah?--if you defense farmers because&#13;
      their land will be used for government projects . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Uh-huh.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Abdul Hakim Nusantara&#13;
                                       November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;djj                                                                                                      9&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: . . or you challenge the government policy in the court, you will have always&#13;
      difficulty . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Oh, you will have, huh?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: . . because in this country you do not have independency of judiciary.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s what Iâ&#128;&#153;ve heard.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: But I think it is wrong if the World Bank say like this. I have discussion like&#13;
      this with the World Bank counsel coming: â&#128;&#156;Well, our policy is good, but this is domestic&#13;
      problem. This is--this is because your internal problem.â&#128;&#157; You cannot say that. You see,&#13;
      because the legitimacy of certain projects based on certain assumption, yeah, I mean, the--you&#13;
      judge the project; the projects will good because of an assumption. But the assumption--if the&#13;
      assumption is not fulfilled, then you should develop different project, different strategy. This the&#13;
      World Bank will not do that, will never do that; they do not want to. They do not want to talk&#13;
      about, letâ&#128;&#153;s say, human rights impact assessment, for example. This is â&#128;&#156;domestic.â&#128;&#157; But how can&#13;
      you talk about peopleâ&#128;&#153;s participation, as always the World Bank claim that they support peopleâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
      participation, without talking about human rights?&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: And does this continue or is there any change?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: This continues still, until now.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: No change.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: No change. There has--I was told by the former country director for Indonesia&#13;
      of the World Bank--I met him last time in Washington last--last April, I think.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: This is Russ [Russell J.] Cheetham or . . .&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Cheetham. He informed me that in fact there has been discussion among the&#13;
      funders of the World Bank, among the shareholders, about the need to change, to broaden the&#13;
      mandate of the World Bank to include democratic issues. But it seems to me this is still remote&#13;
      ideas, yeah? The World Bank will never--well, I agree that human rights impact assessment still&#13;
      need to be developed, the parameters. But we can start with step by step, for example, by&#13;
      judging [inaudible] projects from, letâ&#128;&#153;s say, certain rights perspective: how much a project will&#13;
      strengthen the rights, the economic rights, of the local people, the right to organization of the&#13;
      local people; you can start with that. But even in that fairly limited concept of human rights, the&#13;
      World Bank do not want to touch.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: Has the UN Human Development Report had any effect, do you think?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yes, the UNDP [United Nations Development Program] on . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Abdul Hakim Nusantara&#13;
                                       November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;djj                                                                                                    10&#13;
      LEWIS: Yeah, UNDP.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: . . on freedom?&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Right, freedom index.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Mahbub ul-Haq.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Freedom index, yes, and make the Indonesian government was fairly angry&#13;
      with him.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: With Mahbub, huh? [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Right. It helped us.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: How was--do you see some of the UN agencies more open to this, relative to the&#13;
      World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: What do you mean? The . . .&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: The UN agencies like UNDP or . . .&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yes. Yes, more open than the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: More concerned.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: More concerned about human rights.&#13;
&#13;
      Let me tell you this. The World Bank praised the Indonesian government. According to the&#13;
      World Bank report, during the adjustment period, so from changing--shifting from industrial&#13;
      substitutes, import substitutes industry policy to export-oriented industry policy, according to the&#13;
      World Bank, it does not create negative effect to the poor sections of the community. I doubt&#13;
      very much. If you look at the standard of living, income, of the workers, the industrial workers,&#13;
      there has been declining during the last 10 years. And those industrial workers, they survive&#13;
      although they receive small amount of salary, less than one U.S. dollar a day, because informal&#13;
      sectors, because informal sectors provide, letâ&#128;&#153;s say, a possibility for those workers to develop&#13;
      activities to get extra income.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yes, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Or to get cheap food. And because the--our national, our office, the Central&#13;
      Statistic Bureau, does not collect data: â&#128;&#156;How much? How many?â&#128;&#157; During the last 10 years, the&#13;
      farmers has lost their land, has lost their property, and what happen now with those people, the&#13;
      Central Bureau of Statistic doesnâ&#128;&#153;t have that data because they are not--they donâ&#128;&#153;t care.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: So you mean that . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Abdul Hakim Nusantara&#13;
                                       November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;djj                                                                                               11&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: They--do they try and calculate income distribution?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: They calculate income distribution, but . . .&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: But not, say, the degree of landlessness.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yes, the degree of landlessness. But, you see, the--I doubt whether the&#13;
      research on income per capita, yeah . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      USANTARA: . . is based on, letâ&#128;&#153;s say, sufficient research.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Well, but income distribution would be even more difficult than income per capita.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Even in--well . . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Do they publish . .&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: I cannot say that.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: You donâ&#128;&#153;t know. Do they publish numbers on indexes?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yes. Yes.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: They do.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Every year or every . . .&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Every six months, I think.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Every six months?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: My.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: If Iâ&#128;&#153;m not wrong there.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: You referred to people who lose their lands. In what way do they lose their lands?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: You see, the government of Indonesia in 1975 issued land policy. It is called&#13;
      â&#128;&#156;land condemnationâ&#128;&#157; in American terminology . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Abdul Hakim Nusantara&#13;
                                      November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;djj                                                                                                   12&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yes, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: . . or â&#128;&#156;land confiscationâ&#128;&#157; or something like that.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Condemnation, I think, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: So, under this, under this rule--this is a ministry regulation of 1975 and 1976--&#13;
      if you are private investor, you would like to set up factory here or what and you need land and&#13;
      there is no government land, there is no land which is--the government land is limited--then you&#13;
      can apply to get permits from the local government to take over land from the local people. And&#13;
      in practice, in practice, you will be backed up by the local authority to take over this land from&#13;
      the local community. Then there is no free transaction. There is no market transaction because&#13;
      the price of land has been set up by the local government: â&#128;&#156;The maximum is this.â&#128;&#157; And those&#13;
      who reject can be arrested or accused of being anti-development and end up in jail.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yeah. This is sort of true also in the United States. I mean, you have eminent domain,&#13;
      so called, to take over certain land, and then . .&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: But eminent domain is for public interest.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Uh, it depends.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: This is for private purpose.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yeah, well, I mean itâ&#128;&#153;s supposed to be for the public interest, at any rate, but . . .&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: You referred to the fact that dialogue has begun to develop twice a year. Could you tell&#13;
      us more about that? With whom is this, and how did it work?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Sorry.&#13;
&#13;
      [Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: In the dialogue usually we have discussed many things as regards to World&#13;
      Bank projects in Indonesia like family planning. The discussion on Kedung Ombo has been&#13;
      completed, so there is no more discussion on that, but especially on family planning and, too, on&#13;
      labor issues, especially woman laborers. And then during the meeting with the World Bank, we&#13;
      also discussed about--the World Bank asks our opinion on projects which are submitted by the&#13;
      government of Indonesia to the World Bank: â&#128;&#156;What is your opinion about this project, this&#13;
      projects?â&#128;&#157; But the information is always limited, yeah? We do notâ&#128;&#148;we are not able yet to get&#13;
      detailed information.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: What about the family planning thing? How do you--what is your position on that?&#13;
      And is the Bank being helpful?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Abdul Hakim Nusantara&#13;
                                       November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;djj                                                                                                     13&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Uh, on the family planning issues, we have an opinion like this: we do not&#13;
      challenge the concept, the idea, of birth control, demographic control, thatâ&#128;&#153;s all right. But the&#13;
      problem in this country, the family planning has been designed in such a way, which finally--you&#13;
      have the government forced, force people, while at the same time the accessibility of people to&#13;
      information as regard to various kind of means . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: . . for birth control is very limited.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: What does the government do? Forcesâ&#128;&#148;is this sterilization movement?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Not terrorization, but in the form of, letâ&#128;&#153;s say like this: I will not say terror, but&#13;
      ...&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: No, sterilization.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Sterilization?&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Is that the preferred means of the government to birth control?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: They use Norplant, you know.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Put . . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yeah, in their--uh-huh.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: And also IUD [inter-uterine device] and . . .&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: What do they--they bully the women to accept?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yeah, the family planning targeted especially to women, not to men.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: You say they use force.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: How does that work?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: For example, the so-called â&#128;&#156;safariâ&#128;&#157; campaign. â&#128;&#156;Safariâ&#128;&#157; campaigns means that&#13;
      unity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Abdul Hakim Nusantara&#13;
                                       November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;djj                                                                                                  14&#13;
      LEWIS: Oh, yes. Iâ&#128;&#153;m sorry. The only customers [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: The government officials from the central government come to certain districts&#13;
      or sub-districts or two or three villages, and usually these officials are accompanied with local&#13;
      military authorities. They talk about the importance of family planning, and after that all those&#13;
      poor women or village women are required to be tested, to be examined in small clinics in the&#13;
      government small hospital or something like that. And then she was--she is forced to accept&#13;
      IUD or Norplant, you know, without consulting first their husband. You know, this type of&#13;
      practice is still happening.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Are you familiar with the population program in Thailand?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: No.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Oh, youâ&#128;&#153;re not. Okay. Which--do you have a sense of which external agency--the&#13;
      World Bank or UNFPA [United Nations Fund for Population Activities] or bilateral donors--is&#13;
      any one of them particularly active in the population area here?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: What do you mean?&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Well, I mean . . .&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Which international agency is most active?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: In Indonesia?&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: In Indonesia, in the area of population.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: In the area of population, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Is it the World Bank? Or is it the UN Fund for Population Activities?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: I think U.S. AID [U.S. Agency for International Development] is active.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: AID, huh?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: U.S. AID, and then there is one organization, IPPF, I think.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yes, International Family . . .&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Planned . .&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Planned Parenthood.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Planned Parenthood.&#13;

&amp;#12;djj                                                                                           15&#13;
      NUSANTARA: It has a contact with the IPPA here, Indonesian Planned Parenthood . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yes, yes. Same thing.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: . . Association.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Then there is one from Canada, I think.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: CIDA [Canadian International Development Agency], maybe?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: CIDA, I think so.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: These dialogues that youâ&#128;&#153;re referring to, then, are with the Bank, then.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: Uh-huh, just the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: With the World Bank, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: Itâ&#128;&#153;s your NGO plus others or . . .&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: With INGI, I-N-G-I.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: INGI is the consultative group of NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: I see.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: So, the steering committee of INGI and INGI secretariat, usually about six&#13;
      people or seven people because we also bring the INGI participants in that dialogue.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Right, right.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: But World Bank quite often here also invite the local NGOs for World Bank&#13;
      meeting. But . . .&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: You mean at other times.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: At other times, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Abdul Hakim Nusantara&#13;
                                     November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;djj                                                                                                   16&#13;
      NUSANTARA: The problem is this: the World Bank now is, I think it has started about four&#13;
      or five years ago, I think about four years ago, tried to include, to involve the NGOs in the&#13;
      implementation of World Bank project.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: But we are in the opinion, we as INGI, that kind of approach may endanger the&#13;
      position of the NGOs because the NGOs can be co-opted by the World Bank. Instead to be&#13;
      critical to the World Bank policies and projects, youâ&#128;&#153;re becoming co-opted. Youâ&#128;&#153;re becoming&#13;
      the projectsâ&#128;&#153; holders, projectsâ&#128;&#153; implementers of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: Does the government do the same?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Of course with the government, because the World Bank cannot directly with&#13;
      the NGOs, but the World Bank, the government of Indonesia and the NGOs as sub-contractor of&#13;
      ...&#13;
&#13;
      [Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: How do you see an alternative position? If NGOs are closer to the people and youâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
      when one wants the World Bank to get people participation in a more real sense, then there, if&#13;
      they have to work with the NGOs, that should be a good thing. But there is the danger that&#13;
      NGOs can get co-opted, as you say. But on the other hand--so how do you sort of see that&#13;
      balance?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: You see, let me tell you this. The World--yesterday, no, about two weeks ago,&#13;
      we have a discussion because the World Bank asked INGI, â&#128;&#156;If you would like to get access to&#13;
      information to us, you should make an agreement with the World Bank,â&#128;&#157; which, in that&#13;
      agreement, there is standard format of the agreement with the World Bank, and we finally&#13;
      decided not to enter any agreement sort of that--we decided not to enter to that kind of agreement&#13;
      because what you can expect, what you can expect to change things? I think it is very difficult to&#13;
      change the World Bank, this huge bureaucracy. If we are small and make an agreement with the&#13;
      World Bank, we just will be part of that.&#13;
&#13;
      So what we are doing now is, in Indonesia, to open the discussion among the political&#13;
      community--yeah?â&#128;&#148;among the politicians, the NGOs, about the accountability of the World&#13;
      Bank, of the government of Indonesia, especially in relation, in its relation to the World Bank,&#13;
      how to make the parliament able to control the business dealing which is made by the Indonesian&#13;
      government and the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Abdul Hakim Nusantara&#13;
                                      November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;djj                                                                                                    17&#13;
      KAPUR: Suppose one makes the argument that of, say, a hundred projects that go on in&#13;
      Indonesia, roughly, maybe, the World Bank is involved in two or three, right, because the&#13;
      government of Indonesia does so many projects. Is the government of Indonesia accountable on&#13;
      the remaining 95, because even if you get the World Bank to be accountable for the remaining&#13;
      five, the remaining 95 are still unaccountable? Isnâ&#128;&#153;t that the majority? Or do you feel that the&#13;
      World Bank is even less accountable than the government of Indonesia?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: You are talking about in term of--Iâ&#128;&#153;m talking about projects . .&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: . . which is financially by the World Bank, any financial commitment of any&#13;
      financial connection with the World Bank . .&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: . . how small they are, World Bank should be accountable for that.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Right. But then there are so many other projects that go on in Indonesia where the&#13;
      World Bank is not there. What is the degree of accountability in those projects?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Let me tell you this: this is--in this country, because no democracy, there is no&#13;
      balance of power. Basically, I can say there is no legal accountability. What the government&#13;
      claim as peopleâ&#128;&#153;s participation is that you inform the people, this is â&#128;&#156;participation.â&#128;&#157; But if even&#13;
      in general, although the information is not clear or not fully being delivered to the people, only&#13;
      part of the information, the government will say, â&#128;&#156;This participation.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
      Now, if Iâ&#128;&#153;m not wrong in understanding your question is that, in my opinion, the government&#13;
      should be accountable for the people, which means the people should involve in the decision-&#13;
      making process. But there is no such forum, forum where the people can take a part in the&#13;
      decision-making process.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Let me put Deveshâ&#128;&#153;s question a little differently. I think weâ&#128;&#153;re really agreeing with&#13;
      you that if--I think what heâ&#128;&#153;s implying is your problem is not so much the World Bank; itâ&#128;&#153;s the&#13;
      government. And the reason is that the World Bank is, after all, a creature of governments. The&#13;
      government of Indonesia is one of the owners of the World Bank. The World Bank is not--it is&#13;
      obligated legally to work through its . .&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: The government.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: . . member governments. Itâ&#128;&#153;s different than the Ford Foundation, for example.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: The Ford Foundation can be kicked out, but once they get let in, then they have to be&#13;
      able to deal with you directly. The World Bank canâ&#128;&#153;t do that. And so this question of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Abdul Hakim Nusantara&#13;
                                       November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;djj                                                                                                       18&#13;
      accountability, information and so on, really the Bank may like to be, resist giving out all this&#13;
      information. It may enjoy this sort of closeted character, but legally they donâ&#128;&#153;t have much&#13;
      option. The government has to decide whether or not--how much openness there is.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: But the World . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: So youâ&#128;&#153;re right to go after the government, in a sense, to try to get things opened up.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yes. But the World Bank may strengthen; the World Bank may contribute . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: It may.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: . . strength. It may contribute to, in strengthening this paternalistic and the&#13;
      antidemocratic policy and institution of the government.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yeah, itâ&#128;&#153;s possible.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Right. So if the World Bank took a more sort of--brought this to the attention of the&#13;
      government of Indonesia more openly, that might be a pressure point . .&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: . . on the government.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: I think that was--I understood that to be the idea.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Iâ&#128;&#153;m not saying that the World Bank is a main factor . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: . . for the creation of authoritarian . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: . . institution in Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: But the World--this is internal dynamic, of course. The authoritarian nature of&#13;
      our government is too, too much power because of internal factors. Internal factors create that&#13;
      kind of situation, but external factors can strengthen.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Right. Right.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Is there any evolution going on in one direction or another in these matters?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Abdul Hakim Nusantara&#13;
                                       November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;djj                                                                                                19&#13;
      KAPUR: Say in the last . .&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: In Indonesia?&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Domestically?&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
      [End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
      [Begin Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: We have now environmental management act. One principle which is stated&#13;
      clearly in the environmental management act is this: any decision which will affect the&#13;
      environment--yeah?--should involve the people from the planning process up to the evaluation&#13;
      stage. But how? On what forum the people will be able to take a part? There is no such forum&#13;
      here. There is not yet governmental rule or regulation which provide a forum for the people to&#13;
      implement the principle of participation in development.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: Do you have a sense that the Bank is a good pressure point as a strategy?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: I think so, because we are relying heavily on the World Bank money. And the&#13;
      government of Indonesia--you know, this is the contract. Itâ&#128;&#153;s in every contract [inaudible]&#13;
      attitudes of the World Bank officials. On the one hand they said, â&#128;&#156;This is internal matters. We&#13;
      do not want to intervene.â&#128;&#157; But in fact they intervene our economic policy.&#13;
&#13;
      You see, in 1970 the World Bank advised to the government of Indonesia to reduce the&#13;
      government subsidy policy, the government protective policy towards certain industry. And we&#13;
      still--the government in that time was able to reject what the World Bank advised because the&#13;
      government still have money from oil. Now the government doesnâ&#128;&#153;t have money. Then the&#13;
      government accept all the liberal advice, liberal opinion from the World Bank, and now we are&#13;
      moving to more liberal economic policy.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Well, â&#128;&#156;liberalâ&#128;&#157; in the sense: reducing the bureaucraticâ&#128;&#153;s involvement . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: . . although this deregulationâ&#128;&#148;we call it â&#128;&#156;deregulation policyâ&#128;&#157;--is only&#13;
      benefiting for small group of business. Now the World Bank move farther. They advise the&#13;
      government of Indonesia to abolish monopoly policy in certain industry. They havenâ&#128;&#153;t succeed&#13;
      yet.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: That includes clove.&#13;

&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Cloves, plastics.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: So why have they not succeeded in that, do you think? As opposed to the earlier?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: The government needs more support from the World Bank. It needs more&#13;
      money, more loan.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: They havenâ&#128;&#153;t paid enough yet, you mean?&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: I mean, but theyâ&#128;&#153;ve not been able to change the government of Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s stance on&#13;
      the clove monopoly?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Not yet.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Not yet.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Clothes, did you say?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Cloves, cloves, you know.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Indonesian cigarettes.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Oh, oh, oh, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Is that because, sort of, members of the family are involved?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Family. Yeah, yeah. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: But I mean this pressure point is partly because the government is more dependent on&#13;
      the Bank, or very dependent. But is it also because you think the Bank is maybe a little open to&#13;
      these ideas, to these concerns? Or beginning to be moving in that direction?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: I was told there has been discussion whether the World Bank should broaden&#13;
      its mandate, which will include the principle of good government or something like that.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yeah, governance, yeah, yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: But, so far, it has not been the policy of the World Bank yet. And we are&#13;
      advised by the World Bank officials themselves that we should make campaign.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: That you should make a campaign.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: A campaign. Not in Indonesia but in the Western countries who are the major&#13;
      holders of the World Bank.&#13;

      LEWIS: To broaden the mandate, you mean?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: These are people in the World Bank office here who said that?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Not here, in Washington.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: You said Russ Cheetham [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: The people--the World Bank here doesnâ&#128;&#153;t have any courage to give that kind of&#13;
      opinion.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: In Washington.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: And also in Holland.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: In Holland. World Bank in Holland?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: No, no. There is a representative of Dutch in the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: Oh, I see.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Do you have a sense that over the last five, six years, you said four, five years, there&#13;
      is--the NGOs meet is it twice a year with the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: In INGI, yeah.&#13;

      KAPUR: In INGI, right.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: But before that you didnâ&#128;&#153;t even have that.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: No.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: So do you sort of sense a slight although very slow movement towards talking . .&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: . . at least more dialogue?&#13;

      NUSANTARA: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Let me ask you . .&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: But not at the level of policy yet.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: I see.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: But in relation to that . .&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Not at the level of policy. On case-to-case basis.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: On a--I see. Okay. And like this dam.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: But in relation to that, what about the evolution of the Indonesian NGO movement&#13;
      itself? How much of an NGO movement was there here 20 years ago? 25 years ago?&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Or in the â&#128;&#152;70s?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: In terms of what? Evolution, what do you mean by that?&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: I mean, was it any sort of force? Was it as big a group as . .&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: I will not--talking about 20 years ago, 30 years ago, let me say this. During the&#13;
      last four years, in the last three years, letâ&#128;&#153;s say, the NGOs in Indonesia feel that now it is very&#13;
      important to strengthen their advocacy role.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Right. But was there--were there NGOs of consequence, of importance here 20 years&#13;
      ago? Do you know?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yes. The NGOs play a very important role now.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Now. But then, back then 20 years ago, in 1970?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Not as strong as . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Not as strong now.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: . . as now.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: When was your group established?&#13;

&amp;#12;djj                                                                                                  23&#13;
      KAPUR: 1970. I see.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: We have been 21 years.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Uh-huh. Come of age, huh?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: [Laughs]&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: And has it become bigger?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Much more in the last four, five years?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Yes. Although the NGOs in Indonesia, itâ&#128;&#153;s not as big as in India, yeah?&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yeah, right.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: The biggest one, it has about 200 people . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: . . 200 staff.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: 200 staff. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s a pretty good-sized organization.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: And also the government recognize now the important role of the NGOs. But&#13;
      at the same time, the government also more alert to NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
      WEBB: Mm-hmm, more alert.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: More alert. They try to watch closely and . . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Right. Right. Well, this is very, very interesting. Weâ&#128;&#153;re on a very tight calendar. I&#13;
      think weâ&#128;&#153;d better . . .&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Do you make this kind of study for, letâ&#128;&#153;s say, as a modality to campaign for the&#13;
      changing of the orientation of the World Bank or--I mean, what is the purpose of this kind of&#13;
      study or . . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: The purpose is really, I think, to interpret the history of the Bank to see what it has&#13;
      been and what lessons can be learned from it. Itâ&#128;&#153;s not an uncritical history. I mean, weâ&#128;&#153;re&#13;
      prepared to say the Bank has done some things right and some things wrong. We are not of the&#13;
      Bank, but the Bank has given us access to its records.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: I have a question there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Abdul Hakim Nusantara&#13;
                                      November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;djj                                                                                                      24&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yeah?&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Why the World Bank can finally accept the environmental argument to be&#13;
      included in their policy while at the same time they still cannot accept human rights as part of&#13;
      their policy?&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Yeah. I think that it has to do with the politics of the Bank, really. The Bank is set up&#13;
      by governments as a specialized technocratic agency. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a little bit like a--well, it was a banker,&#13;
      and there are certain things that banks are supposed to have expertise on and other things they&#13;
      arenâ&#128;&#153;t. And among those other things that they werenâ&#128;&#153;t supposed to have expertise on were sort&#13;
      of very straight political things which, after all, were the business of the governments that set&#13;
      them up, and they were sort of jealous of their sovereign prerogatives.&#13;
&#13;
      KAPUR: Also it was the UN system which was supposed to have greater expertise on these, on&#13;
      political issues, whereas the World Bank and the IMF [International Monetary Fund] were much&#13;
      more as banks, as financial institutions. There was sort of division of labor. So the ILO&#13;
      [International Labor Organization] on labor issues . . .&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: How the World Bank perceives that--okay, what this country still need&#13;
      development aid, loan, soft loan from the World Bank, but at the same time the rich people of&#13;
      this country, which also as a result of this type of model of development--yeah--this model of&#13;
      development produce certain group of very, very rich people . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Absolutely. No, this is one . .&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: . . and they park their money, they put their money outside Indonesia. If this&#13;
      money can be brought to Indonesia, well, we have capital to develop more. Almost 70 billion&#13;
      dollars Indonesian money is parking--is parked in Singapore and Switzerland.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Really, huh? Yeah, yeah. Well, a lot of it is . .&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: How the World Bank perceive this? I mean . . .&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: I donâ&#128;&#153;t--we canâ&#128;&#153;t tell you. We donâ&#128;&#153;t speak for the Bank. So weâ&#128;&#153;re just--weâ&#128;&#153;re trying&#13;
      to learn about the Bank ourselves. I think the Bank perceives it as a very important dimension of&#13;
      Indonesian development that thereâ&#128;&#153;s been this very unequal development.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: Most of the people at the Bank personally would prefer that it would not be so&#13;
      unequal.&#13;
&#13;
      NUSANTARA: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: But theyâ&#128;&#153;re in the business, A, of promoting--primarily promoting growth because&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Abdul Hakim Nusantara&#13;
                                        November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
they think thatâ&#128;&#153;s what--development is the essential thing, and, B, they feel inhibited about how&#13;
much they can intrude into some of these particularly political issues, where their charter says&#13;
you shall not try to be a political agency.&#13;
&#13;
NUSANTARA: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: So thatâ&#128;&#153;s why theyâ&#128;&#153;re talking now about maybe broadening out their mandate. But itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
a dicey business.&#13;
&#13;
I usedâ&#128;&#148;I know a fair amount about India; I was in India many years. And in the middle â&#128;&#152;60s&#13;
there was a great lot of stress between the World Bank and the government of India. At one&#13;
point, the president of the World Bank lectured the government of India about its defense&#13;
spending: â&#128;&#156;Too high.â&#128;&#157; And the government of India was furious: It was no business of this&#13;
technical, economic institution to have anyâ&#128;&#148;to know anything at all about their defense&#13;
spending. It didnâ&#128;&#153;t have a right to an opinion.&#13;
&#13;
NUSANTARA: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And itâ&#128;&#153;s that sort of thing that they--theyâ&#128;&#153;re reacting to.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But itâ&#128;&#153;s basically quite political.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Of course.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
NUSANTARA: Is there any alternative--with more cheaper--that is cheaper than making&#13;
foreign debt?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You mean borrowing?&#13;
&#13;
NUSANTARA: Borrowing, yes.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, if thereâ&#128;&#153;s more ODA [official development assistance], if thereâ&#128;&#153;s more freer,&#13;
cheaper money, that is gift money, grant money, then, of course, you donâ&#128;&#153;t get the debt burden&#13;
with it, but thereâ&#128;&#153;s a very limited supply of this grant money. And you people here, despite the&#13;
poor, donâ&#128;&#153;t need it as much as the Bangladeshis or the Africans.&#13;
&#13;
NUSANTARA: Yeah, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You know . .&#13;
&#13;
NUSANTARA: So soft loan and . .&#13;
&#13;
                                   Abdul Hakim Nusantara&#13;
                                 November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Soft loans are very limited.&#13;
&#13;
NUSANTARA: . . are limited. Yeah, yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Iâ&#128;&#153;m afraid weâ&#128;&#153;d better run along.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Weâ&#128;&#153;ve taken a lot of your--weâ&#128;&#153;re very grateful for . .&#13;
&#13;
NUSANTARA: Youâ&#128;&#153;re always welcome. And I would like to see the result of this writing.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: If you come to Washington again, look us up. One or the other of us will be there all&#13;
the time.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Weâ&#128;&#153;ll be working there for two years.&#13;
&#13;
NUSANTARA: Mm-hmm.&#13;
