&#13;
   A STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE&#13;
&#13;
1. Country and Sector Issues&#13;
&#13;
1.      Chad is one of the world's poorest countries, struggling to overcome nearly&#13;
four decades of civil war and regional instabilities. Poverty is widespread, and social&#13;
indicators are well below the average for sub-Saharan Africa. It ranked 173 among the&#13;
177 countries surveyed in the 2005 U.N. Development Program (UNDP) Human&#13;
Development Index. The incidence of poverty (defined as the proportion of households&#13;
with annual spending below what is necessary to meet minimal needs) is estimated at 55&#13;
percent according to a 2003 household survey. About four-fifths of the population of&#13;
about 8.8 million is living on less than a dollar a day. Of the population older than 15&#13;
years, more than 73 percent (and 76 percent of women) are illiterate. Access to potable&#13;
water has improved in past years, but is still limited to one of three people in 2005. Less&#13;
than two percent of the population has access to electricity. In this country twice the size&#13;
of France, a total of only 1,021 kilometers of roads has been paved.&#13;
2.      Chad has made progress in macroeconomic stabilization and economic&#13;
reforms in the past decade. Under the economic adjustment and reform program&#13;
supported by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the&#13;
government managed to contain inflation, improve the external current account deficit,&#13;
and achieve several years of robust economic growth. The construction of a 1,100-&#13;
kilometer pipeline to exploit the oil fields in southern Chad, a project supported by the&#13;
World Bank Group, has given the country a major new source of revenues that holds&#13;
promise for reducing poverty and creating a more sustainable economic footing for the&#13;
future.&#13;
3.      These developments have yet to produce the sustainable economic outcomes&#13;
that are needed if Chad is to achieve sustainable development. Chad remains highly&#13;
vulnerable to political instability and armed rebellion. The situation has been made more&#13;
precarious by the advent of petroleum revenues, which have unleashed new economic&#13;
opportunities, but also created new political pressures on how the revenues are used and&#13;
distributed. The Darfur crisis in neighboring Sudan and other sources of domestic and&#13;
regional instability are putting heavy demands on government spending. As security and&#13;
defense spending grow, poverty reduction and lasting economic and institutional reforms&#13;
are losing ground to an unsustainable deficit and mounting budgetary arrears.&#13;
4.     The Government and its development partners have laid out a number of&#13;
strategic plans for confronting the country's economic problems. The National&#13;
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) revised in April 2008 focuses not only on&#13;
&#13;
                                             1&#13;
&amp;#12;using oil revenues for poverty reduction, but also calls for promoting good governance&#13;
and strengthening institutional capacity to ensure effective management of public&#13;
resources. The Bank and IMF have financed numerous other projects and programs&#13;
focused on structural reforms and poverty reduction; however, the Joint IMF/Bank Staff&#13;
Assessment in 2004 and the government assessment of implementation of the PRSP&#13;
showed that little progress had been made on this agenda.&#13;
5.      Overall economic activity was sluggish in 2008 and prospects for 2009 are&#13;
worrisome. Oil production is estimated to have dropped 11.8 percent from 2007 to 2008&#13;
to hit 127,000 barrels a day and 46.5 million for the whole year. Still, high international&#13;
oil prices have yielded major benefits for Chad through high revenues in 2008 estimated&#13;
at $1.9 billion from $1.2 billion in 2007. Yet, conflicts between the government and rebel&#13;
forces in 2008 affected to a significant extent economic performance in the non-oil&#13;
sectors. The economic loss deriving from the rebel attack was significant. The decline in&#13;
investment that accompanied the drop in overall real GDP growth was largely on account&#13;
of lower private sector investment in the oil sector. While the government stepped up&#13;
investment spending to rehabilitate public buildings and repair roads, public investment&#13;
remained slightly lower than its 2007 level. With the worldwide oil prices steep decline&#13;
from $145 in summer 2008 to $40 in December 2008, there are real concerns about&#13;
Chad's ability to maintain its current level of public spending and to weather the on-going&#13;
financial crisis. Against this backdrop of severe economic prospects, the country is&#13;
discussing with the IMF a new Staff Monitored Program that is expected to be signed by&#13;
end of the first 2009 semester and that would pave the way for the revival of the HIPC&#13;
program.&#13;
6.      Telecom and ICT Snapshot. In Chad, out of a total population of 10.8 million in&#13;
December 2007, the number of main fixed-line in operation was 13,000 and 5,000&#13;
CDMA1 and the number of mobile subscriptions was 1.1 million, representing a fixed&#13;
teledensity2 of 0.17 and a mobile teledensity3 of 10.26. The number of broadband&#13;
subscribers and international bandwidth were respectively estimated to less than 100 and&#13;
50 to 55 Mbps in the same period. In Chad, the number of cybercafé and computer was&#13;
respectively less than 100 and between 20,000 and 30,000. The eGovernment Readiness&#13;
for Chad was 0.1047 in 2008 as compared to a level of 0.1433 in 2005 and to be&#13;
benchmarked to an average Central Africa eGovernment Readiness of 0.2530 (average&#13;
eGovernment Readiness for the World: 0.4514).&#13;
7.       The telecom and ICT sector detailed structure. Chad's teledensity is among the&#13;
lowest in the world and even far below the average for sub-Saharan Africa. With a&#13;
population of almost ten million inhabitants and an area more than twice the size of&#13;
France, the country has only around 13,000 fixed telephone lines and around 100 public&#13;
payphones. This development gap is even more marked in the rest of the country, with 80&#13;
percent of fixed telephone lines located in the capital N'Djamena and the remaining 20&#13;
percent distributed among the other major towns. There is no telecommunications fiber-&#13;
optic backbone network in Chad, long-distance and international connections are entirely&#13;
satellite-based or using microwave radio technologies (the latest are used by the mobile&#13;
private operators). The Société des Télécommunications du Tchad (SOTEL TCHAD),&#13;
1&#13;
  CDMA stands for Code Division Multiple Access.&#13;
2&#13;
  Number of fixed telephone lines per 100 inhabitants.&#13;
3&#13;
  Number of mobile subscriptions per 100 inhabitants.&#13;
&#13;
                                                     2&#13;
&amp;#12;the country's incumbent operator, provides limited telecommunications and data services.&#13;
SOTEL TCHAD is an incorporated State Owned Enterprise (SOE). Internet uptake is&#13;
suppressed by high access prices and poor quality of service (in N'Djamena an hour of&#13;
access costs CFAF 2,000 around $4, compared to CFAF300, $0.6 in Benin) and, (iv)&#13;
International mobile calling prices are high. At around CFAF400-600 per minute, a call&#13;
to Paris is two to three times more expensive than in neighboring Cameroon.&#13;
8.      As in many other African nations, the number of mobile subscribers in Chad is&#13;
now far greater than the number of fixed-line connections. Thanks to the development of&#13;
mobile telephony since 2000, Chad has boosted its total telecommunications penetration&#13;
rate from 0.1 line per 100 inhabitants (1999) to over 11 lines (fixed and mobile) per 100&#13;
inhabitants at the end of 2007(about 1.6 million active mobile subscribers). Until the end&#13;
of 2007, two private mobile operators, Celtel and Tigo, shared the local market. In&#13;
December 2007, Salam, a third GSM operator (SOTEL TCHAD affiliate) started&#13;
commercial operations (mainly in N'djamena). Chad was connected to the Internet in&#13;
1997. Two years later, Internet Protocol (IP) telephony, using prepaid cards, was&#13;
introduced. Radiodiffusion Nationale Tchadienne (RNT) is the state-operated national&#13;
radio broadcaster, while Télé-Tchad is the national television broadcaster.&#13;
9.      Policy and regulation overview. The Ministry of Post and ICT (MPTIC) was&#13;
responsible for regulation of the telecommunications sector until the Telecommunications&#13;
Act was passed in August 1998. In July 2000, the Office Tchadien de Régulation des&#13;
Télécommunications (OTRT) was established. The OTRT is a public body under the&#13;
responsibility of the MPTIC. The OTRT has financial and management autonomy.&#13;
Following the adoption of the CEMAC4 Directives on Electronic Communications&#13;
Services (in line with good international practices and consistent with Central African&#13;
Backbone (CAB) design, the Government of Chad has requested a Project Preparation&#13;
Facility (PPF) to finance he harmonization and adaptation of sector legal and regulatory&#13;
framework.&#13;
10.     High cost structure is resulting in less trade. The isolation and high cost&#13;
structure of Chad have held back the availability of affordable telecommunications&#13;
infrastructure. Without access to low price and high quality telecommunications&#13;
services, it is very costly for the Chadians to trade with each other, and with the rest of&#13;
the world (limiting opportunities to create jobs, and expand production of goods and&#13;
services).&#13;
&#13;
11.     The lack of modern backbone infrastructure5 at the national level is an&#13;
additional key constraint. All operators do not have broadband terrestrial networks and&#13;
rely on expensive and poor quality satellite connectivity or microwave backbones to link&#13;
up cities at the national level. Some projects have been proposed in the past, but none&#13;
have materialized due to a combination of factors including inadequate legal and&#13;
&#13;
4&#13;
 Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC)&#13;
5&#13;
 For the purposes of this project, backbone infrastructure refers to a collection of high-capacity fiber optic&#13;
or point-to-point wireless (e.g., microwave) links between main populated areas, both within countries and&#13;
between countries, which serve as the basis on which telecom operators provide voice and data services.&#13;
The text at some points will make the distinction between: national backbone networks (within countries),&#13;
regional backhaul networks (between neighboring countries, terrestrial networks), and regional backbone&#13;
networks (between the region and the rest of the world, e.g., undersea cables).&#13;
&#13;
                                                      3&#13;
&amp;#12;regulatory framework and investment climates, and the complexity of a multi-country&#13;
investment project and related concerns about financial sustainability. Recently, existing&#13;
operators (fixed and mobile) and public authorities began to explore new business models&#13;
that could foster the deployment of such infrastructure at the national level. The new&#13;
infrastructure could be developed through a public-private partnership (PPP) public&#13;
funding to complement private financing when the risk-return profile is unattractive and&#13;
overall operation is managed by the private sector, under principles of competitive level&#13;
pricing and Open Access principles.6 Such backbones would connect the capital and&#13;
secondary cities (contributing to reduce the urban-rural divide) to neighboring countries&#13;
but also provide redundancy routes (network securization). Operators and service&#13;
providers could then provide affordable and better quality ICT and eGovernment services&#13;
to citizens. Effective cross-border links and supporting regulatory frameworks are&#13;
therefore critical for the Chad and the region as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
12.    Closing the infrastructure gap and opening up access to cheaper bandwidth.&#13;
The transmission network (long-distance and international) is entirely based on satellites.&#13;
The proposed fiber-optic transmission backbone proposed by the Central African&#13;
Backbone (CAB) Program would link the telecommunications network in Chad to those&#13;
in Cameroon, CAR, Nigeria and eventually Sudan. The telecommunication networks in&#13;
Chad will then connect international submarine fiber-optic cables, with onward&#13;
connectivity to other African countries, Europe and the Far East. The CAB Program&#13;
would provide additional bandwidth capacity to enable the development of the&#13;
telecommunications and internet sector.&#13;
13.     Without cross-border initiatives and regional coordination, Chad may not be&#13;
in a position to solely achieve low-cost broadband access and low-cost regional&#13;
connectivity. A prefeasibility study was conducted by a specialized international firm in&#13;
Cameroon, CAR and Chad that evidence the economies of scale and cost efficiencies of a&#13;
truly regional and fully integrated end-to-end backbone infrastructure. The study&#13;
demonstrates the financial and technical feasibility of the CAB Program and recommends&#13;
the implementation of CAB APL1 involving Cameroon, CAR, and Chad. The study&#13;
forms the basis for the design and framework for the CAB Programt intervention. The&#13;
CAB network, as designed, is a regional telecommunications network made up of&#13;
suitable on-ward terrestrial fiber connections to submarine fiber-optical cable systems&#13;
linking several Central African countries and providing the region with a digital&#13;
broadband access to the global fiber network. In addition to the build-out of&#13;
approximately 2,200 km of new fiber-optic infrastructure, the planned broadband&#13;
backbone would leverage the 1,000 km existing fiber-optic infrastructure laid along the&#13;
oil pipeline between Kribi (Cameroon) and Doba (Chad). The study developed nine&#13;
scenarios, the traffic demand and flows for the targeted countries and has set key&#13;
principles (the CAB network is to be a shared infrastructure promoting an Open Access&#13;
regime and owned and operated according to PPP principles).&#13;
&#13;
14.    In May 2007, based on the findings of the study, the heads of state of CEMAC&#13;
adopted a Declaration calling for the establishment of the CAB under Open Access and&#13;
Public-Private Partnership (PPP) principles and asked for donor intervention. In line with&#13;
6&#13;
 "Open Access" is broadly defined as an equal opportunity for operators and service providers to have&#13;
unfettered access to given infrastructure or services under similar terms and conditions.&#13;
&#13;
                                                 4&#13;
&amp;#12;the Regional Integration Assistance Strategy (RIAS) and national CAS/ PRSP, the World&#13;
Bank Group (World Bank and IFC) and the African Development Bank (AfDB) provided&#13;
Technical Assistance (TA) to CEMAC and Central African countries to conduct&#13;
preparatory studies. Regional and national technical committees were set-up since 2007.&#13;
In parallel, the World Bank participated (as an observer) to the elaboration of the 2008&#13;
CEMAC Directives on Electronic Communications Services in line with sector good&#13;
practices and the CAB Program as designed.&#13;
&#13;
15.     A new operating model consisting of a new regional network and national&#13;
telecom operators will become fully integrated, thus driving prices lower. The CAB&#13;
structure as designed and supported by the proposed World Bank Program calls for the&#13;
establishment of a new regional telecom operator and national operators. These operators&#13;
would be in charge of reselling international, regional, and national capacity to existing&#13;
national operators and service providers at discounted rates compared to current pricing&#13;
in the targeted countries. In a medium scenario, international bandwidth price reduction&#13;
could be above 50 percent for landlocked countries (including Chad) the first year of&#13;
operation. As such, the CAB network will increase competition for the provision of&#13;
international and national capacity (new alternative infrastructure, fiber-optic backbone,&#13;
competing with satellite and microwave connectivity).&#13;
&#13;
16.     Key principles (promoting Open Access regimes, developing wholesale markets&#13;
and promoting PPPs have been defined in the study and have to be endorsed by all&#13;
participating countries in order to be eligible for World Bank financing. To keep some&#13;
flexibility, the detailed arrangements (in terms of ownership and management) will be&#13;
defined at the country-level, taking into account the difference of all eligible countries in&#13;
terms of sector structure, level of development and access, operational and financial&#13;
situation of the respective SOE.&#13;
&#13;
17.     The backbone network that will be installed at the country-level will use a&#13;
hybrid competitive and cooperative approach. This reflects the need to differentiate&#13;
the role of the government and the operators and to build strong partnerships with the&#13;
private sector to develop telecommunications infrastructure.&#13;
18.     The government's role is to focus on providing the right incentives for&#13;
infrastructure and services to reach areas unattractive to the private sector (on a purely&#13;
commercial basis), as well as in cases where large initial sunk investments are required.&#13;
Government participation through the financing of segments of the CAB backbone will&#13;
be used to buy-down the cost of capital: therefore the prices that could be charged to&#13;
consumers to recover the investment (regulatory mechanisms will be set-up to ensure that&#13;
lower costs are passed to the consumer). Additional government support may take the&#13;
form of government participation in the new legal entity created for the build-out of the&#13;
backbone networks (such as through contribution of existing assets), guarantees,&#13;
subordinated debt, ensuring rights-of-way, and/or commitment to purchase certain&#13;
capacity on the network for a given time period.&#13;
19.     Role of the private sector. The private sector will participate in financing, and&#13;
will install, maintain and operate the CAB network. The capital and financing structure&#13;
will be a blend of public and private sector. The inclusion of the private sector and profit&#13;
sharing can bring several benefits including: (i) access to private finance; (ii) reduced&#13;
&#13;
                                             5&#13;
&amp;#12;operational risk for public sector; (iii) faster delivery of capital projects; (iv) project&#13;
management skills; and (v) entrepreneurship and innovation. The PPP structure will&#13;
share the risks and rewards between the government and the private companies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    CAB PPP Structure and financing&#13;
&#13;
20.     The CEMAC - in coordination with the Governments of Cameroon, CAR and&#13;
Chad, the World Bank Group, the AfDB, and the International Telecommunication Union&#13;
(ITU) - has launched the recruitment of the investment bank and legal adviser&#13;
(transaction advisers) to finalize the structure and mobilize the private funding.&#13;
&#13;
21.     The design and ownership structure of the PPP will (i) maximize the use of&#13;
private financing (or minimize the use of public financing); (ii) ensure feasibility and&#13;
attractiveness of the transaction; (iii) secure Open Access to regional connectivity&#13;
infrastructure; and (iv) ensure competitive, reasonable tariff of international, regional and&#13;
national capacity&#13;
&#13;
22.      New legal entities will be formed for the purposes of owning and operating the&#13;
CAB networks. This will take the form of a consortium including the private operators,&#13;
private financers', incumbent operators and/ or governments. The private sector will&#13;
install and maintain the CAB networks. A contract will be set between the private sector&#13;
and the existing public telecommunications operators on the management of the national&#13;
backbones (the new structure could also be leveraged to manage these networks). Final&#13;
ownership distribution will be based on the amount of private financing mobilized and&#13;
final contributions made by the Governments.&#13;
&#13;
23.    The IFC is playing a role as part of the World Bank Group's support to the&#13;
CEMAC and to Governments as they finalize an optimal structure for the public-private&#13;
partnership that ensures the feasibility and attractiveness of the transaction. If needed&#13;
IFC may also assist in mobilizing funding or assist investors7.&#13;
24.     Financing CAB Program APL1. The first phase of the CAB program proposed&#13;
for IDA financing will cover Cameroon, Central African Republic and Chad. This first&#13;
Phase of CAB Program 8 comprising APL-1A and APL-1B, will be structured as a&#13;
vertical APL. APL1A will cover the technical assistance to strengthen the enabling&#13;
environment and prepare the PPP structure for the establishment of the CAB Network.&#13;
APL1B will focus on financing the connectivity infrastructure of the CAB Network. To&#13;
establish the CAB infrastructure in Cameroon, CAR and Chad (that will utilize the&#13;
existing 1,000 km fiber-optic backbone laid next to the oil Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline),&#13;
approximately $40 million will be contributed from the first phase of the CAB program&#13;
(technical assistance will be provided through APL1A and connectivity infrastructure&#13;
will be partly financed by APL1B).&#13;
&#13;
7&#13;
  In consultation with the Conflict of Interest Office, the WBG has disclosed the potential risk of perception&#13;
of conflict of interest to the Governments highlighting the expected benefits from the institution to&#13;
intervene as a Group.&#13;
8&#13;
  The first Phase, CAB APL1, includes two parts: APL-1A and APL1B. See Para 33 for more explanation&#13;
on the structure.&#13;
&#13;
                                                      6&#13;
&amp;#12;25.    In addition, the AfDB will provide parallel financing to establish complementary&#13;
backbone infrastructure in CAB APL1 countries. However, the cost and design of this&#13;
additional infrastructure is not included in the CAB APL 1. As structured, the World&#13;
Bank CAB Program and CAB APL1 will not be affected if the AfDB financing does not&#13;
materialize.&#13;
&#13;
26.     Private sector interest. An additional $27.8 million is estimated to be needed to&#13;
establish the CAB network for the CAB APL1 countries. It will be mobilized from the&#13;
private sector (private equity, off-take agreements and commercial debt). The structure as&#13;
recommended has been presented to all public and private operators in CAB APL1&#13;
countries (but also in other eligible countries). Despite the economic and financial crisis,&#13;
all operators have confirmed their strong interest in the venture since CAB will lower&#13;
significantly their operating cost and provide new opportunities for additional network&#13;
coverage. Several operators have announced that they will explore the opportunity to&#13;
contribute financially, and some international commercial banks have also expressed an&#13;
interest.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Rationale for Bank involvement&#13;
&#13;
27.     Strong government commitment to the ICT sector and to digital divide&#13;
initiatives. Chad's government has put in place an ICT development program (Sector&#13;
Strategy and NICI adopted in 2008) that focuses on building a fiber network linking the&#13;
country to Cameroon, Central African Republic and Sudan to provide affordable data and&#13;
voice services and support the development of eGovernment projects. The Government&#13;
has initiated the first regional study for the CAB and has been a key promoter of the&#13;
regional program. Finally, the adoption of a specific Declaration for the project in May&#13;
2007 by the CEMAC heads of state highlights the commitment of the government of&#13;
Chad. Significant technical and financial resources have been mobilized by the countries&#13;
and the CEMAC Commission to accelerate the implementation of the CAB Program.&#13;
28.      The proposed operation is consistent with the Interim Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy (CAS) of Chad and particularly within the framework of the Africa Action&#13;
Plan. The Interim CAS highlights the role of key infrastructure (such as roads and&#13;
telecom backbones) and the need for policy harmonization in the sector. The World&#13;
Bank's Africa Region Development Strategy (discussed at the Board in July 2003)&#13;
identified advances in ICT as one of the three emerging positive trends in the 21st century&#13;
for Africa, offering "enormous opportunities to leapfrog stages of development". The&#13;
CITCD also fits within the Bank's comprehensive Africa Action Plan developed in 2005,&#13;
which further articulates goals and objectives covering several important development&#13;
areas including: (i) building national development strategies and measuring results; (ii)&#13;
building capable states and improving governance; (iii) supporting drivers of growth; and&#13;
(iv) strengthening and implementing partnerships at the country level. The CITCD will&#13;
facilitate cross-border communications traffic and hence promote trade, stimulate cross-&#13;
border movement of factors of production and promote regional integration.&#13;
29.    The CITCD fits well with WBG's Regional Integration Assistance Strategy&#13;
for Africa (RIAS). The Bank's RIAS discussed at the Board in April 2004, identified&#13;
&#13;
                                             7&#13;
&amp;#12;advances in ICT as one of the three emerging positive trends in the twenty-first century&#13;
for Africa, and highlight its role for the regional connectivity objective. The CITCD and&#13;
APL1A will strengthen and implement partnerships at the regional level (including&#13;
regulatory harmonization) and will support for both Economic Community of Central&#13;
African States (ECCAS) and CEMAC objective of creating a unified economic space in&#13;
Central Africa.&#13;
30.     The World Bank Group is well placed to contribute within the frame of a&#13;
multiple development partners' effort. The WBG has been involved in the CAB&#13;
program since 2005. The May 2007 Declaration of the CEMAC heads of state called&#13;
explicitly for World Bank Group financial support for the implementation of the CAB&#13;
program. The overall program has been formulated with other key stakeholders and DFIs&#13;
(the AfDB joined the initiative in 2007 and is providing parallel financing for the CAB&#13;
Program; The African Union (AU) is also playing an important role in facilitating inter-&#13;
governmental cooperation and policy harmonization, in conjunction with the CEMAC).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes&#13;
&#13;
31.     The development objective will be the engine of shared growth achieved by:&#13;
(i) accelerating the physical roll-out of backbone infrastructure (investment intervention&#13;
based on PPPs to leverage private sector investment in infrastructure); and (ii) removing&#13;
monopoly regimes through policy and regulatory support to ensure that once in place, the&#13;
infrastructure is accessible to all operators on open, transparent and non-discriminatory&#13;
terms.&#13;
&#13;
32.     The project will help reduce the cost of doing business in Chad. In the 2009&#13;
Doing Business report which presents quantitative indicators on business regulations and&#13;
the protection of property rights compared across economies, Chad was ranked 175 out of&#13;
181 countries, while Cameroun was ranked 164, Equatorial Guinea 167, and Gabon 151.&#13;
Infrastructure services remain costly and inefficient, thus making the cost of doing&#13;
business very high. For Chad to achieve higher and sustained growth performance, it will&#13;
need to develop rapidly its basic infrastructure. A better communications infrastructure,&#13;
capable of delivering advanced ICT services throughout the country would reduce the&#13;
cost of doing business.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   B PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
1. Lending instrument&#13;
&#13;
33.     Lending instrument. The lending instrument is a Regional IDA horizontal and&#13;
vertical Adaptable Program Loan (APL). The Communications Infrastructure and&#13;
Technology APL Project (APL1A)_ - Chad Credit (CITCD) is part of the first phase of&#13;
the CAB Program. The APL instrument is well-suited to take into consideration the&#13;
length of time it takes to achieve the overall objective of establishing a regional network&#13;
for Central Africa. An APL is also flexible enough to accommodate the different level of&#13;
&#13;
                                            8&#13;
&amp;#12; readiness of the participating countries (horizontal APL) and to phase Technical&#13;
 assistance if needed prior to the mobilization of the required financing for the&#13;
 infrastructure (vertical APL).&#13;
 34.     Breakdown of Regional and National IDA allocations. Since this is a Project&#13;
 included in a regional Program, supplementary regional IDA funding can be used to&#13;
 leverage country allocations for up to two-thirds of the full proposed IDA amount of the&#13;
 project, with country allocations covering one third of the project cost attributable to each&#13;
 individual country involved (taking into account that the National IDA allocation cannot&#13;
 exceed 20 percent of the FY National Allocation). The table below provides a summary&#13;
 of the regional/national IDA breakdown for CITCD and estimated breakdown for the&#13;
 activities in Chad to be supported under APL1B 9.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. Project components&#13;
&#13;
35.    The first phase of the CAB proposed for Chad will be structured as a vertical APL&#13;
to cover first the technical assistance to strengthen the enabling environment and prepare&#13;
the PPP structure for the establishment of the CAB (APL1A) then a subsequent part will&#13;
focus on financing the connectivity infrastructure of the CAB (APL1B).&#13;
&#13;
36.     The CITCD (part of APL1A) will therefore finance activities related to the&#13;
"enabling environment" component, and the "project management" component while&#13;
APL1B (expected to be presented for Board approval in April 2010) will finance&#13;
activities related to the "connectivity" component described in the CAB Program.&#13;
APL1B will be triggered after (i) the establishment by the recipients and other&#13;
stakeholders of a legal structure which will install and manage the CAB network in&#13;
accordance with PPP principles and Open Access regime; and (ii) the CAB legal&#13;
structure has received the legal rights to install, manage and operate the CAB network on&#13;
the Recipient's territory.&#13;
&#13;
37.   The CITCD will have the following components and activities see Annex 3&#13;
for more details):&#13;
38.      Component 1 ­ Enabling environment ($7.4 million). This component will&#13;
finance various activities in the form of technical assistance (TA), training and&#13;
equipments in order to (i) modernize the ICT policy, legal and regulatory environment;&#13;
(ii) strengthen key public institutions (including OTRT, MPTIC, SOTEL TCHAD and&#13;
STPE); and (iii) promote a pro-competitive environment and restructure of Incumbent&#13;
operators. This component is a key for the effective establishment of the Central African&#13;
Backbone network.&#13;
       -    Modernize and harmonize the ICT legal and regulatory framework in Chad&#13;
            to accelerate sector growth and ICT development. It will include, in particular the&#13;
            following activities (i) TA to modernize and harmonize the legal and regulatory&#13;
            framework for Electronic Communications Services, and (ii) TA to develop ICT&#13;
            legislation.&#13;
&#13;
       -    Strengthen capacity of key public stakeholders (MPTIC and OTRT) to&#13;
            promote further sector reform. It will include the following activities: (i) TA to&#13;
            develop regulatory tools (i.e., interconnection/tariffs, networks monitoring, Open&#13;
            Access); (ii) TA to increase ICT access in remote areas; (iii) TA to review&#13;
            spectrum management framework in Chad and prepare bidding documents for&#13;
            the acquisition of a spectrum management and monitoring system; (iv) training/&#13;
&#13;
10&#13;
     E1: This is equivalent to two (2) Mbps.&#13;
&#13;
                                                     10&#13;
&amp;#12;        capacity building; and (v) equipments (i.e., spectrum management and&#13;
        monitoring system, information systems).&#13;
&#13;
   -    Promote a pro-competitive environment and restructure of incumbent&#13;
        operators to maximize the benefits from the regional backbone. The project will&#13;
        finance in particular the following activities: (i) TA to promote and establish PPP&#13;
        to deploy the CAB; and (ii) TA to define and implement the restructuring options&#13;
        and privatize of incumbent operators.&#13;
&#13;
   -    Establish Internet Exchange Point (IXP) to complement the other investments&#13;
        that the government and the private-sector are undertaking to boost connectivity&#13;
        and the capacity of the regional backbone network. The project will include the&#13;
        following activities: (i) TA to design the establishment of an IXP in Chad and (ii)&#13;
        Equipments for the IXP.&#13;
&#13;
   -    Launch structuring and start-up consultancies required for the establishment&#13;
        of CAB networks including CAB-related environmental and resettlements&#13;
        consultancies (i.e. the preparation of specific Environmental Management Plans&#13;
        (EMP), Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) and Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) if&#13;
        planned).&#13;
&#13;
39.     Component 2 ­ Project management capability ($1.6 million). This component&#13;
will consist in financing project management related issues. It will support the following&#13;
activities: (i) consultants to staff the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) (i.e., a procurement&#13;
specialist, a Financial Manager, an internal auditor, an accountant, a backbone expert);&#13;
(ii) equipments (i.e., financial management system); (iii) various TA (i.e., Audits); (iv)&#13;
training and (v) operating expenses.&#13;
&#13;
40.    With respect to CAB APL1 countries including Chad, the connectivity component&#13;
will be financed under APL1B expected to be presented for Board approval in April&#13;
2010. The financing to be provided for Chad for this subsequent phase is estimated at&#13;
about $14.7 million (including contingencies). Most connectivity infrastructure will&#13;
support the deployment of regional backhaul links in the country and across the borders&#13;
with neighboring countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design&#13;
&#13;
41.    Enabling environment to meet market potentials. The inadequate enabling&#13;
environment prevents or reduces investments from operators or services providers. It is&#13;
expected that the CITCD , while promoting a pro-competitive environment on services&#13;
and markets, will leverage existing strengths of the ICT markets. The growth of the ICT&#13;
market in Chad can be accelerated if actions are taken to mitigate bottlenecks&#13;
jeopardizing the development of markets. As an example, Celtel's network coverage&#13;
reached over 53 percent of the population in 2007 with the main hubs being N'Djaména,&#13;
Moundou and Abéché. The reduction of call rates and adoption of universal access&#13;
&#13;
                                             11&#13;
&amp;#12;policy would therefore be the key drivers for growth in the mobile sector. Moreover&#13;
growth in the Internet industry is still very slow and highly constrained. It remains a&#13;
service for use by industry, government and a privileged few at home. This can be&#13;
attributed to several factors such as: (i) the high cost of international bandwidth,&#13;
especially of the SAT3/WASC/SAFE system, and (ii) the lack of an IXP to reduce the&#13;
cost of local traffic.&#13;
42.     Different roles for public and private actors in the ICT sector. The CITCD&#13;
reflects the need to develop strong partnerships with the private sector to develop&#13;
telecommunications infrastructure, where government and the telecommunications&#13;
operators have differentiated roles. This project is based on the well-learned lesson that&#13;
the private sector is better placed to develop and operate ICT infrastructure, as it is&#13;
generally able to provide investment for infrastructure rollout. The role of the&#13;
government is to focus on providing the right incentives for infrastructure and services to&#13;
reach areas unattractive to the private sector on a purely commercial basis, as well as in&#13;
cases where large initial sunk-investments are required. The private sector is better&#13;
placed to invest in, install, manage and maintain ICT infrastructures Moreover the&#13;
inclusion of the private sector and profit sharing can bring the following benefits: (i)&#13;
access to private finance; (ii) reduced operational risk for public sector; (iii) faster&#13;
delivery of capital projects; (iv) project management skills; and (v) entrepreneurship and&#13;
innovation. Therefore, the models presented here which involve the sharing of risk&#13;
between the government and the private companies (PPP) can be defined as an agreement&#13;
between government and private entities for the purpose of delivering a project or service&#13;
by sharing the risks and rewards of the venture. The PPP model helps to bridge gaps in&#13;
quality, speed, and efficiency in the provision of services by the public sector.&#13;
5. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection&#13;
&#13;
43.    Focusing on development of applications would be premature. Activities for&#13;
the development of eGovernment services are eligible for support under the CAB&#13;
program. However without adequate infrastructure in place to support the bandwidth&#13;
need for IT services/ Internet, it would prove very difficult and inefficient to develop&#13;
such applications at a larger scale. Therefore it was decided to delay the beginning of&#13;
these activities at a later stage (this would be mainly supported by the CAB AfDB&#13;
Project).&#13;
44.     Cooperative approach is welcome in a resource-constrained environment.&#13;
The project will promote the development of a collaborative framework to finance and&#13;
establish a regional and national backbone. An alternative design would have been to&#13;
finance backbone links under a competitive structure, where each operator would bid&#13;
separately for the construction of a particular link or group of links. However, the&#13;
countries targeted have inadequate environment or the market size does not justify&#13;
multiple backbones outside the main cities. The proposed solution will accelerate the&#13;
deployment of broadband backbones within Chad and will be used by all operators and&#13;
service providers (Open Access).&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;     C IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
1. Institutional and implementation arrangements&#13;
&#13;
Institutional and implementation arrangements (See Annex 5)&#13;
The MPTIC will be responsible for the overall coordination, implementation, and&#13;
supervision of the project. For each activity concerned, MPTIC, through the PCU, will&#13;
consult with and delegate to the relevant agencies and ministries.&#13;
&#13;
45.     The implementation arrangements involve three organizational levels: (i) a&#13;
Project Steering Committee (Comité de Pilotage) will be responsible for providing advice&#13;
regarding cross-sectoral issues; (ii) the PCU will be responsible for project&#13;
implementation, coordination of activities and fiduciary management; and (iii) a Chad&#13;
CAB Technical Committee that will provide technical input for the development of the&#13;
regional backbone.&#13;
46.     The MPTIC and the Chad CAB Technical Committee liaise with other CAB&#13;
participants.11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results&#13;
&#13;
47.     The Monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) of CAB will be embedded in the&#13;
various components of the project, and TA provided through the project will include&#13;
support for M&amp;E. The MPTIC and the OTRT will collect most indicators needed to&#13;
monitor and evaluate the project (the last indicators are collected by an international&#13;
organization on a yearly basis). Both national institutions have been collecting the&#13;
selected indicators for several years. However, the project will provide support through&#13;
technical assistance to strengthen their statistical units.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
48.     Moreover, at the regional level, an IDF grant (CEMAC - strengthening capacity in&#13;
the telecom &amp; IT sector ­ IDF Grant P109923) has been processed to strengthen the&#13;
telecom legal and institutional environment of CEMAC region and improve the telecom&#13;
and information technology representation/visibility to increase regional&#13;
telecommunications and Information Technology (IT) investments. The grant will&#13;
finance short-term TA to adequately monitor regional telecom and IT activities and to&#13;
develop a common M&amp;E system shared by all CEMAC Member States (including Chad).&#13;
This system will be validated by CEMAC Member States. The establishment of this&#13;
M&amp;E system will (i) increase knowledge transfer between member states and reinforce&#13;
CEMAC coordination and policy role for the region; (ii) improve sector visibility for the&#13;
&#13;
11&#13;
   To date CAB APL1 countries have established: (i) an Inter-Ministerial Committee involving sector&#13;
ministers, (ii) an expert commission involving three representatives from each participating CAB APL1&#13;
country, and one representative from the following institutions: the World Bank, the AfDB, the CEMAC,&#13;
the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) and the International Telecommunications&#13;
Union; (iii) national technical committees involving representatives from the government, the regulatory&#13;
agency, the public and private operators and users groups.&#13;
&#13;
                                                  13&#13;
&amp;#12;government (as a main growth contributor) and therefore improve sector policy decision&#13;
to attract additional foreign direct investment.&#13;

50.     The component 1 will support the establishment of the CAB PPP environment&#13;
and structure. APL1B will finance CAB connectivity infrastructure to be implemented&#13;
through the set PPP. The CITCD will also stimulate sector development in the country&#13;
and promote competition. The stimulation of the supply of low-cost wholesale&#13;
international connectivity will be a major boost to investment and competition in the&#13;

      D APPRAISAL SUMMARY&#13;
1. Economic and financial analysis&#13;
54.     The benefits accrued in the targeted countries (i.e. increased access to quality and&#13;
affordable ICT services) spill over country boundaries as: (i) higher volumes increase the&#13;
viability of the regional communications infrastructure network, decrease cost of access&#13;
and increase trade between African countries and (ii) cross-border initiatives provide&#13;
countries with the incentives to develop missing infrastructure to increase ICT access.&#13;
Indeed, the implementation of the CAB Program will have a transformational impact on&#13;
regional connectivity which will impact regional trade and overall economic integration&#13;
of the participating CAB countries.&#13;
55.     A detailed traffic study and a financial model have been developed by&#13;
International consultants for CAB APL1 countries and Nigeria. Results from the study&#13;
shows that traffic will expand significantly due to the growth of mobile operators and the&#13;
development of the Internet market (i.e. International bandwidth in Chad will increase&#13;
from 32 Mbps in 2006, to 338 Mbps in 2011, to 560 Mbps in 2016) . The CAB network&#13;
will carry a significant portion of this traffic (especially for landlocked countries using&#13;
exclusively satellites).&#13;
56.    The opportunity cost in Cameroon, CAR and Chad calculated to measure&#13;
economies from the cost of providing bandwidth relying on satellite connection as&#13;
opposed to CAB Network until 2021 is estimated at $117 million (discount rate of 13&#13;
percent and average annual decrease of satellite connection of 8 percent).&#13;
57.    The economic impact in Cameroon, CAR and Chad on a 10 year model is&#13;
estimated at $94 million out of which $76 million as consumer surplus and $18 million as&#13;
producer surplus.&#13;
&#13;
                                            19&#13;
&amp;#12;58.      Based on the financial projections and taking into account the existing public-&#13;
private structure, it is expected that CAB network could generate a positive net income in&#13;
the first twelve months of operations.&#13;
2. Technical&#13;
59.     The design and ownership structure of the PPP to be established based on ongoing&#13;
technical assistance provided at Regional-level and the technical assistance to be&#13;
provided under the CITCD will be consistent with international best-practices. The CAB&#13;
Program, APL1A and the CITCD will (i) maximize the use of private financing (or&#13;
minimize the use of public financing); (ii) ensure feasibility and attractiveness of the&#13;
transaction; and (iii) secure Open Access to regional connectivity infrastructure and&#13;
ensure competitive, reasonable tariff of international, regional and national capacity.&#13;
3. Fiduciary&#13;
&#13;
60.    Financial Management. Chad is a conflict-affected country with a weak PFM&#13;
system which cannot be used directly to implement the proposed CITCD. As a result, a&#13;
PCU is set up within MPTIC with full fiduciary responsibility to manage the project. At&#13;
the time of writing this assessment, there is no FM system in place in the PCU due to the&#13;
delay caused by the late release of the PPF deposit. Therefore, the following FM&#13;
arrangements are agreed upon and have to be met before effectiveness: (i) recruit a&#13;
Financial Manager, an accountant and an internal auditor to handle the fiduciary&#13;
functions; (ii) install a computerized accounting system; and (iii) develop a sound PIM to&#13;
manage the project.&#13;
61.     In terms of reporting, it's agreed that quarterly unaudited Interim Financial&#13;
Reports (IFR) will be submitted by the PCU to IDA within 45 days after the end of each&#13;
quarter. The PCU will appoint an external auditor acceptable to IDA to audit the Project&#13;
annual financial statements and submit the audit reports within 6 months after the end of&#13;
each FY.&#13;
62.     Ultimately it's expected that the financial management function with the PCU&#13;
will serve to manage AfDB financing once signed as well. Specific staffing adjustment&#13;
will be discussed in due course with AfDB, eth World Bank and the Government when it&#13;
occurs (additional support for financial management and procurement functions).&#13;
63.     Disbursement. One Designated Account in CFAF will be opened in a&#13;
commercial bank and managed by the PCU under the responsibility of the Project&#13;
coordinator and the Financial Manager. Upon effectiveness, the DA will receive an initial&#13;
deposit equivalent to four month expenditures forecast and replenished regularly on a&#13;
monthly basis against statements of expenditures (SOE) through Withdrawal&#13;
Applications cleared by the Internal Auditor. Direct payment may be used whenever&#13;
appropriate for payments of expenditures equal to 20 percent or more of the DA. At the&#13;
beginning, the transactions-based disbursement method will apply. In the second FY, the&#13;
project may shift to the report-based disbursement method if satisfactory IFR and audit&#13;
reports are submitted in a timely manner and the project sustains satisfactory FM rating.&#13;
The grant will finance 100% of eligible expenditures exclusive of taxes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           20&#13;
&amp;#12;64.     Procurement. The PCU of the MPTIC will be responsible for the administration,&#13;
coordination, monitoring of the Project and procurement activities including compliance&#13;
with procurement procedures. The PCU include a coordinator appointed by the&#13;
Government, a Financial Manager (recruitment in process), a procurement specialist&#13;
(recruitment in process), an internal auditor (recruitment in process) and, an accountant&#13;
(recruitment in process), all recruited on a competitive basis.&#13;
65.    A PIM including the financial administrative arrangements with a detailed section&#13;
on procurement is currently under drafting and outlines, among others, the procurement&#13;
arrangement and the relevant procedures applicable to the management of the grant.&#13;
66.    Procurement corrective measures have been identified and an action plan has been&#13;
defined with tasks to be performed, responsible body as well as time-frame (see annex 7).&#13;
67.     Procurement risk. The overall project risk for procurement is substantial because,&#13;
among other factors, there was no previous Bank operation with this ministry and the&#13;
PCU with procurement responsibility, which is been set up and staffed, is a completely&#13;
new entity and is not familiar with procurement processes. Although procurement risk&#13;
rating is presently substantial, the above well designed action plan with mitigation&#13;
measures to be implemented and appropriate monitoring will reasonably bring this risk to&#13;
moderate.&#13;
68.    Guidelines: All international competitive bidding (ICB) and selection of&#13;
consultants involving international consultants will be carried out in accordance with the&#13;
World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated&#13;
May 2004 and revised in October 2006; and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Recipients" dated May 2004 and revised in October 2006,&#13;

69.     Category B rating. The APL1A (including CITCD) has a Category B rating.&#13;
Activities financed under CITCD are fully consistent with the set of activities eligible for&#13;
financing under the CAB Program.&#13;
70.     The physical components of the CAB Program in Chad (to be financed under&#13;
APL1B) will mostly be limited to the establishment of the regional backbone which&#13;
consists of terrestrial networks (e.g. fiber-optic cables laid next to main national roads.&#13;
The risk associated with the kind of infrastructure financed under this Program is low,&#13;
and the project is therefore assigned to environmental category B under OP 4.01.&#13;
71.   The ESMF and the RPF have been prepared, reviewed and approved by the&#13;
Bank and publicly disclosed prior to appraisal in Chad. They are available at the&#13;
InfoShop.&#13;
72.      Specific costed Environmental Management Plans (EMP) and Resettlement&#13;
Action Plans (RAPs) will be prepared as necessary for the terrestrial facilities during&#13;
project implementation, in line with the ESMF and RPF, once the exact locations of those&#13;
facilities have been identified. The institutional responsibilities for preparing the various&#13;
safeguards instruments would lie with the implementing agency. These agencies will be&#13;

&amp;#12;assisted by consultants financed by the project. Any specific required action for some of&#13;
the Civil Works will be taken into account during project implementation.&#13;
73.    Since CAB APL1 (APL1A and APL1B) in Chad will only finance fiber-optic&#13;
cables laid next to main national roads (no rural networks and landing stations will be&#13;
financed), OP 4.10 for indigenous peoples, OP 4.36 for Forests and OP 4.11 for Cultural&#13;
Property will not be triggered. The CITCD will not finance any fiber-optic cable/&#13;
backbone infrastructure (it will be funded under APL1B expected to be presented for&#13;
Board approval in April 2010).&#13;

Project Coordinator (nominated) and a Financial Manager, a procurement specialist, an&#13;
internal auditor and, an accountant, all recruited on a competitive basis. Environmental&#13;
expertise (and other position like backbone expert) will also be available, depending on&#13;
the needs identified in the detailed environmental assessments. These experts will be&#13;
financed by the project through performance based contracts linked to evaluation results&#13;
acceptable to IDA. The PCU will be housed in MPTIC to facilitate knowledge transfer&#13;
and strengthen capacity at Ministry level.&#13;
&#13;
5.     A Project Steering Committee (Comité de Pilotage) will be established and will&#13;
be in charge of ensuring the consistency and smooth execution of the project. It will&#13;
meet at least twice a year. Placed under the MPTIC (or his representative), it will&#13;
comprise at least of representatives of the Ministry of Finance and of the participating&#13;
agencies and ministries, as well as the Project Coordinator. The Steering Committee will&#13;
provide advice on coordination of cross-sectoral interventions and ensure consistency of&#13;

missions per year during project implementation, including an annual progress review. A&#13;
mid-term review will be conducted, which will encompass: (i) a thorough review of the&#13;
execution of the project and the achievement of project objectives to date; and (ii)&#13;
agreement between the Bank and the Recipient on recommended measures to ensure&#13;
efficient execution of the project and successful achievement of project objectives in the&#13;
period after the review, all in accordance with agreed performance indicators. The&#13;

Country issues&#13;
&#13;
1.      A country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) was carried out by IDA&#13;
in 2003. In April 2006 the donors, including the WB, IMF, European Union, and AfDB,&#13;
conducted a general assessment of the country institutions - comprising public financial&#13;
management - that concluded that Government of Chad needs to improve its Public&#13;
Financial Management System significantly for donors to rely upon. The main fiduciary&#13;
risks are with poor budget formulation, preparation and execution and weak cash&#13;
management processes that need to be addressed. In terms of appropriate legislation and&#13;
regulatory frameworks, significant progress needs to be made also to ensure that the risk&#13;
associated with the lack of clear rules and regulations are mitigated. The assessment also&#13;
concluded that audit institutions do not have adequate capacity to discharge their&#13;
obligations and follow-up of audit findings. In July 2006, the government signed a&#13;
memorandum of understanding with the Bank in which it commits itself to provide 70&#13;
percent of the budgeted resources to priority ministries. Since then, the Government has&#13;
committed itself to modernize its PFM system with the ongoing IDA-supported PFM&#13;
Reform Project. Still, all these commitments are yet to be implemented and the results&#13;
monitored.&#13;

&#13;
3.     Strengths: the project design is very simple in essence. The CITCD will be&#13;
implemented by a PCU under the oversight of the MPTIC. Ultimately, the same PCU will&#13;
manage AfDB financing once effective by building on the proposed fiduciary&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
4.       Weaknesses and Action Plan: The project preparation activities are delayed by the late&#13;
transfer of PPF resources. As a result, there is no FM system in place (request for quotation has&#13;
been launched). Therefore, the FM assessment at this stage consists in designing the adequate&#13;
arrangements and agreeing on a time-bound action plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Implementing entity&#13;
&#13;
5.      A PCU will be set up within MPTIC to manage the CITCD. A Project coordinator is&#13;
already appointed and is now recruiting the specialized fiduciary staff. The FM functions will be&#13;
handled by the FM team under the supervision of a qualified Financial Manager so-called&#13;
"Responsable Administratif et Financier" supported by an accountant. Besides, an Internal&#13;
Auditor will be appointed to ensure full adherence to fiduciary rules including anti-corruption&#13;
considerations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Budgeting&#13;
&#13;
6.       The activities and the breakdown of cost to be financed under the CITCD have been&#13;
identified. Annual work plans, to be approved by the Steering Committee, will clearly detail the&#13;
activities and translate them into annual budgets. The PCU will monitor its execution with the&#13;
integrated financial software in accordance with the budgeting procedures specified in the manual&#13;
of procedures and report on variances along with the quarterly Interim Financial Monitoring&#13;
Reports (IFRs). Basically the PCU will prepare the overall budgets on an annual basis. The&#13;
budgeting system needs to forecast for each fiscal year the origin and use of funds under the&#13;
project. Only budgeted expenditures would be committed and incurred so as to ensure resources&#13;
are used within the agreed upon allocations and for the intended purposes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Accounting policies and procedures&#13;
&#13;
7.      Chad is a member of OHADA organization, hence adheres to OHADA&#13;
accounting standards, so-called Syscohada, which are in line with the international&#13;
accounting standards. Syscohada accounting standards will apply to this project. A&#13;
specific chart of accounts will be developed and documented in the manual of&#13;
procedures. A computerized accounting system, with a double entry system, is being&#13;
purchased and will be customized to record the PPF and the project's transactions and to&#13;
generate accurate financial reports in time.&#13;
&#13;
Internal control and auditing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8.       Internal controls are yet to be put in place. They will comprise the whole systems&#13;
of control, financial or otherwise, established by management in order to (a) carry out the&#13;
project activities in an orderly and efficient manner; (b) ensure adherence to policies and&#13;
procedures; and (c) safeguard the assets of the project and secure as far as possible the&#13;
completeness and accuracy of the financial and other records. A PIM will document the&#13;
internal controls with a specific focus on the following: (i) segregation of duties; (ii)&#13;
physical control of assets; (iii) authorization and approval; (iv) clear channels of&#13;
command; (v) arithmetic and accounting accuracy; (vii) integrity and performance of&#13;
staff at all levels; and (viii) supervision.&#13;
&#13;
9.     An internal auditor acceptable to IDA will be competitively selected and&#13;
appointed to ensure full adherence to the procedures, pre-screen and clear all payments to&#13;
ensure they are supported by the following reliable evidences: (i) expenditures are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               35&#13;
&amp;#12;budgeted; (ii) the service is rendered according to the contract; and (iii) the payment is&#13;
within the available budget allocation. Besides, the PCU will coordinate with the&#13;
"Inspection Générale des Finances" -IGF- to include this project in their annual audit&#13;
program and reviewed it at least once a year. IGF audit report shall be communicated to&#13;
the PCU and the World Bank supervision missions.&#13;
&#13;
Financial Reporting.&#13;
&#13;
10.    PCU will record and report on project transactions then will submit to the World&#13;
Bank an IFRs not later than 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter. At a&#13;
minimum, the financial reports must include the following tables with appropriate&#13;
comments; (i) Sources and Uses of Funds; (ii) Uses of Funds by Project&#13;
Activity/Component; and (iii) Special account activity statement.&#13;
11.     At the end of each fiscal year, the project will issue the Project's Financial&#13;
Statements (PFS) comprising: (i) a balance sheet; (ii) a statement of sources and uses of&#13;
funds; (iii) accounting policies and procedures; and (iv) explanatory notes. These PFS&#13;
will be subject to annual external audits as described below.&#13;
&#13;
External audit.&#13;
&#13;
12.     The project annual financial statements will be audited by qualified external&#13;
auditors yet to be appointed. The audit reports comprising the audited financial&#13;
statements, a single audit opinion and a management letter will be submitted to IDA not&#13;
later than 6 months within the end of each fiscal year. These audits will be carried out in&#13;
accordance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISA). The audit TOR and&#13;
appointment of the external auditors will be agreed upon within 4 months after&#13;
effectiveness. The tentative due dates of the audit report will be as follow:&#13;

&amp;#12;  Disbursement arrangements and flow of funds&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  13.     Flow of funds: One Designated Account (DA) in CFAF will be opened in a&#13;
  commercial bank and managed by the PCU under the responsibility of the Project&#13;
  coordinator and the Financial Manager in terms of ensuring fiduciary standards and&#13;
  accordance with Bank FM guidelines. Upon effectiveness, the DA will receive an initial&#13;
  advance up to a ceiling of CFAF 279,000,000 (equivalent to four month expenditures&#13;
  forecast) and replenished regularly through monthly Withdrawal Applications cleared by&#13;
  the Internal Auditor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  14.     No replenishment of the accounts will occur until the previous expenditures made&#13;
  out of the process of the previous allocation have been properly documented.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  15.    Allocation of Grant Proceeds The World Bank will issue a "Disbursement&#13;
  Letter" which will specify the additional instructions for withdrawal of the proceeds of&#13;
  the Grant. The following table shows the allocation of the proceeds of the Grant by&#13;
  disbursement category.&#13;

and Operating Costs for Components 1 and 2 of the&#13;
Project&#13;
(2) Refund of Preparation Advance                                 530,000        Amount payable pursuant&#13;
                                                                                 to Section 2.07 of the&#13;
                                                                                 General Conditions&#13;
TOTAL AMOUNT                                                     9,000,000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Disbursement Methods:&#13;
&#13;
  16.     Given the high risk environment and the lack of familiarity with the Bank&#13;
  fiduciary procedures by the project staff, the report-based disbursement may not be&#13;
  applicable by default. Thus the transaction-based disbursement method will apply at the&#13;
  beginning. Once the PCU demonstrates its ability to submit reliable quarterly IFR, the&#13;
  project may shift to the report-based method in the second year if it sustains a satisfactory&#13;
  FM rating. Other disbursement methods, such as reimbursement, direct payment and&#13;
  special commitment may be applicable. The minimum value for direct Payment,&#13;
  reimbursement and Special Commitment will be 20 percent of the DA ceiling.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      37&#13;
&amp;#12;Types of Supporting Documentation:&#13;
&#13;
17.     The Bank requires either copies of the original documents evidencing eligible&#13;
expenditures ("Records") or summary reports of expenditure ("Summary Reports").&#13;
Disbursements will be supported by (i) Statement of Expenditures (SOE) summarizing&#13;
eligible expenditures paid during a stated period for amounts below the SOE&#13;
documentation threshold specified in the Disbursement Letter and (ii) records evidencing&#13;
eligible expenditures (e.g. copies of receipts, supplier invoices). In all cases, the PCU will&#13;
be responsible for retaining the original documents evidencing eligible expenditures and&#13;
making them available for audit or inspection.&#13;
18.    Taxes: The grant will finance 100% of eligible expenditures exclusive of taxes.&#13;
The Country Financing Parameters for Chad dated June 2004 indicate that there are no&#13;
taxes or duties that are discriminatory or unreasonable. For this operation, the Recipient&#13;
and Bank team agreed to exclude taxes to ensure that most of the grant proceeds would&#13;
be used to finance project activities rather pay for taxes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Financial covenants:&#13;
&#13;
19.     Financial covenants are the standard ones as described in the legal documents and&#13;
are comprised of maintaining project accounts in accordance with sound accounting&#13;
practices, audit requirements and records well kept and secured.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Conclusion and Supervision Plan:&#13;
&#13;
20.     Currently the PCU does not have any FM system in place to manage the project.&#13;
Hence the overall FM risk is high at this point in time but the residual risk would be&#13;
Moderate provided the action plan below is implemented satisfactorily. On that basis and&#13;
in accordance with the risk-based approach, one (1) supervision mission will be carried&#13;
out in the first year once an acceptable FM system is effective at the PCU.&#13;

&#13;
A. General&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Environment&#13;
&#13;
1.      The Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) has been conducted in&#13;
Chad in 1993 and 2000. There was also an Audit for five significant bidding conducted&#13;
by the Supreme Court in 2002. The conclusions of the CPAR can be summarized as&#13;
follow : (i) absence of a national procurement regulatory body ; (ii) inexistence of the a&#13;
formal process to contest decisions, (iii) cumbersome and lengthy validation process&#13;
impacting ability to effectively disburse national and other/external financial allocations;&#13;
(iv) excessive use of sole-sourcing selection.&#13;
2.      To follow-up on CPAR recommendations, the government with the technical and&#13;
financial assistance of the Association (IDA) has conducted a reform that let to the&#13;
adoption of the new Procurement Code (December 5th, 2003). The Procurement Code&#13;
and the secondary legislation have incorporated most comments and recommendations&#13;
from the CPAR. In particular, the new Code (art. 5) recognizes the higher level of&#13;
International Agreements in case of disagreement with the national procurement&#13;
legislation. However, some areas needs to be strengthened/reviewed: (i) obligation given&#13;
to international bidders/firms to associate with national bidders/firms; (ii) obligation for&#13;
international and national bidders/firms to obtain a qualification certificate for&#13;
international bidding processes; and (iii) complex process for the award and the signature&#13;
of contracts involving the Minister of Finance and the President when contract are above&#13;
$100,000. These weaknesses have been discussed with the government during the&#13;
preparatory mission and its revision is included in the ongoing dialogue on Governance&#13;
with our partner the African development Bank. For International Competitive Bidding,&#13;
the directives highlighted in the "Guideline: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA&#13;
Credit" and the standard IDA bidding documents will be used. For National Competitive&#13;
Bidding, the government has accepted that "Guideline: Procurement under IBRD Loans&#13;
and IDA Credit" will be applied.&#13;
&#13;
Guidelines&#13;
&#13;
3.     Procurement for this project would be carried out in accordance with the World&#13;
Bank "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004&#13;
and revised in October 2006; and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants&#13;
by World Bank Recipients" dated May 2004 and revised in October 2006, and the&#13;
provisions stipulated in the Financing Agreement. The general description of various&#13;
items under different expenditure category is described below. For each contract to be&#13;
financed by the grant, the different procurement (works, goods and non-consulting&#13;
services) methods or consultant selection methods, prequalification, estimated costs, prior&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            40&#13;
&amp;#12;review requirements, and time-frame would be agreed between the Recipient and the&#13;
Bank Task Team in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at least&#13;
annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and&#13;
improvements in institutional capacity. To the extent practicable The Bank's Standard&#13;
Bidding Documents for goods and Standard Requests for Proposals for Proposals as well&#13;
as all standard evaluation forms would be used throughout project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Publicity&#13;
&#13;
4.      A comprehensive General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be prepared by the&#13;
Recipient and published in the United Nations Development Business online (UNDB&#13;
online) and in the Development Gateway Market (dgMarket) following Board Approval,&#13;
to announce major consulting assignments and any ICB13. The GPN shall include all&#13;
ICB for goods contracts and all large consulting contracts (i.e., those estimated to cost&#13;
$200,000 or more). In addition, a specific procurement notice is required for all goods to&#13;
be procured under ICB in dgMarket and UNDB online. Requests for expressions of&#13;
interest for consulting services expected to cost more than $200,000 shall be advertised in&#13;
UNDB online and in dgMarket. An Expression of Interest (EOI) is required in the&#13;
national gazette or a national newspaper or in an electronic portal of free access for all&#13;
consulting firm services regardless of the contract amount. In the case of NCB14, a&#13;
specific procurement notice will be published in the national gazette or a national&#13;
newspaper or an electronic portal of free access. Contracts awards will also be published&#13;
in UNDB and dgMarket, in accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines (para.&#13;
2.60) and Consultants Guidelines (para. 2.28).&#13;
&#13;
Works&#13;
&#13;
5.      No major works are foreseen under this project. Small works estimated to cost&#13;
less than $100,000 equivalent per contract may be procured through shopping, based on&#13;
price quotation obtained from at least three contractors in response to a written invitation&#13;
to qualified contractors.&#13;
&#13;
Goods&#13;
&#13;
6.      Goods procured under this Project would include vehicles, furniture and office&#13;
equipment. Taking into account (level of value added) manufactured/producers capacity&#13;
in the country, procurement of goods will be bulked where feasible (similar nature and&#13;
need at same time period) into bid packages of at least $ 500,000 valued, so that they can&#13;
be procured through suitable methods to secure competitive prices. The procurement will&#13;
be done using the Bank's SBD for all ICB. Goods estimated to cost $ 500,000 equivalent&#13;
and above per contract will be procured through ICB. For any others goods contracts&#13;
cost less than $500,000 equivalent (and above $200,000), NCB procurement method in&#13;

&amp;#12;accordance with national procedures can be used using Standard Bidding Document&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. Procurement of readily available off-the-shelf goods that cannot&#13;
be grouped into bid packages of $100,000 or more may be procured through shopping in&#13;
conformity with the clause 3.5 of the procurement guidelines. Vehicles whose cost is&#13;
estimated at less than $ 100 000 could be procured through UNOPS or quotation.&#13;
&#13;
           Procurement of non-consulting services&#13;
&#13;
7.      Non-Consulting services under this project include maintenance of the office&#13;
electronic equipment and other services such as printing, and editing. Non-Consulting&#13;
services are likely not to exceed the equivalent o f $100,000 per contract. Procurement of&#13;
such services will be done using prudent shopping procedures in conformity with the&#13;
clause 3.5 of the procurement guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
Selection of consultants&#13;
&#13;
8.      Consulting services will be needed for the following activities: (i) technical&#13;
assistance; (ii) feasibility studies and any other critical studies; (iii) technical and&#13;
financial audit; environmental and social studies, etc,.. These consulting services will be&#13;
procured with the most appropriate method among the following which are allowed by&#13;
Bank guidelines and included in the approved procurement plan: Quality-and Cost-&#13;
Based Selection (QCBS), Quality-Based Selection (QBS), Selection under a Fixed&#13;
Budget (SFB), Least-Cost Selection (LCS). Selection Based on Consultants'&#13;
Qualifications (CQ) will be used for assignments that shall not exceed $200,000. Single&#13;
Source selection shall also be used in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 3.9 to&#13;
3.13 of the Consultant Guidelines, with IDA's prior agreement. All terms of reference&#13;
will be subject to IDA prior review.&#13;
&#13;
9.     Short lists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than $200,000&#13;
equivalent per contract may be composed entirely of national consultants in accordance&#13;
with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
10.     Assignments in excess of $200,000, and specialized technical assistance&#13;
assignments, must be procured on the basis of international short-lists after appropriate&#13;
advertisement in UNDB on line, DgMarket and in the national gazette or a national&#13;
newspaper or in an electronic portal of free access.&#13;
&#13;
11.     Consultant for services meeting the requirements of section V of the consultant&#13;
guidelines, will be selected, under the provisions for the Selection of Individual&#13;
Consultants, through comparison of qualifications among candidates expressing interest&#13;

                                            42&#13;
&amp;#12;Training, workshops and study tours&#13;
&#13;
12.     Participation in training sessions, workshops, seminars, conferences, and study&#13;
tours will be subject to the approved annual programs. The latter will identify the general&#13;
framework of training and similar activities for the year, including the nature of the&#13;
training, study tours, workshops, number of participants, as well as estimated costs.&#13;
&#13;
Operating costs&#13;
&#13;
13.     Operational costs, which will be financed by the project, would be procured using&#13;
the project's financial and administrative procedures manual previously agreed on by the&#13;
Bank. For efficiency purpose, operational furniture packages will be procured on the&#13;
basis of 6 or 12 months need and procured competitively. For services (car maintenance,&#13;
computers maintenance etc...) to be financed through operational costs, the project will&#13;
proceed by service contracting for a defined period.&#13;

&#13;
B. Evaluation of the MPTIC and PCU's capacity to award contracts in line with&#13;
guidelines&#13;
&#13;
14.   An assessment of the procurement capacity of the MPTIC and the PCU has been&#13;
conducted during the appraisal mission and the conclusions are the following.&#13;
&#13;
   -    Ministry of Post, Information Technologies and Communications (MPTIC)&#13;
&#13;
15.     A Commission in charge of opening and assessing proposals (Commission&#13;
d'Ouverture et de Jugement des Offres - COJO) located within the MPTIC is in charge of&#13;
all the matters related to procurement. This commission is composed as follows:&#13;
       General Secretary of the MPTIC : President ;&#13;
       A representative of the Ministry of Economics and Planning : Vice President ;&#13;
       The manager of Administrative and Finance Affairs MPTIC : Member ;&#13;
       The Head of Procurement Affairs MPTIC : Member ;&#13;
       The Director of Financial Control Affairs of the Ministry of Finance and Budget :&#13;
       Member ;&#13;
       The structure in charge of public markets : observer :&#13;
&#13;
16.     Beyond COJO, a service in charge of Procurement is located at the MPTIC. This&#13;
service aims at preparing and overseeing all activities related to procurement within the&#13;
Ministry. This service is comprised of a head of procurement with proven experience&#13;
with Bank procedures and countries in the region. The service also handles the COJO's&#13;
secretariat.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            43&#13;
&amp;#12;17.    No particular anomaly was noted in the COJO and Procurement service's&#13;
operations. The delay for the Commission in charge of assess the proposal to produce the&#13;
evaluation reports does not exceed ten days and usually, COJO rules on the evaluation&#13;
report within a time not exceeding a week. However certain insufficiencies were reported&#13;
during the evaluation mission and concern: (i) the lack of skilled staff at the level of the&#13;
Service of Procurement Service (Service de Passation des Marchés SPM); (ii) lack of&#13;
computers and financial management system software; and (iii) lack of office equipment.&#13;
These weaknesses are likely to harm the good execution of the Project and it is thus&#13;
proposed: (i) to reinforce the Procurement Service (SPM) with at least two agents and to&#13;
ensure staff training in specialized centers in the Africa region; (ii) to computerize the&#13;
management and follow-up of the procurement service within the MPTIC through the&#13;
purchase of the desk and laptop computers equipped with financial and Procurement&#13;
management and follow up software, (iii) to ensure the formation on the acquired&#13;
software and (iv) to equip this service with office equipment (photocopier, printers etc.)&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;   -    Project Coordination Unit (PCU)&#13;
&#13;
19.     A Project Coordination Unit was set up and already includes a Project&#13;
Coordinator. At the time of evaluation mission, the process of recruiting a procurement&#13;
specialist, a Financial Manager, an internal auditor, an accountant, and an executive&#13;
assistant was not finalized (recruited all on a competitive basis).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
20.     As per the above assessment an action plan was prepared to reinforce the&#13;
capacities of the PCU. Keeping in mind that the recruitment process of the key personnel&#13;
is currently in progress, this action plan includes (i) the preparation of a procurement plan&#13;
for the next eighteen months (plus annual update) to ensure the project is carried out&#13;
within the agreed timeline; (ii) the training of the Procurement specialist to be recruited&#13;
on the World Bank Procurement Guidelines and Directives; (iii) the purchase of&#13;
computers equipped with management software and furniture and office equipments; (iv)&#13;
the design and finalization of an operation manual including the financial administrative&#13;
arrangements with a detailed section on procurement in order to outline, among others,&#13;
the procurement arrangement and the relevant procedures applicable to the management&#13;
of the grant; and (v) the regular audit of procurement process.&#13;

23.     At appraisal, the Recipient will prepare a procurement plan for project&#13;
implementation providing the basis for the procurement methods. This plan, covering the&#13;
first 18 months of project implementation, will be discussed and agreed upon by the&#13;
Recipient and the project team at negotiations. It will be available in the Project's&#13;
database and a summary will be disclosed on the Bank's external website once the project&#13;
is approved by IDA Board of Executive Directors. The Procurement Plan will be&#13;
updated in agreement with the Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual&#13;
project implementation needs and improvement in institutional capacity.&#13;

1.     Economic and financial analysis with a focus on connectivity. An assessment&#13;
study for backbone connectivity was conducted with the help of international consultants&#13;
in several CAB eligible countries (including Chad). A preliminary economic and&#13;
financial analysis was carried out based on this study, and yielding the results outlined&#13;
below.&#13;
&#13;
2.      The aim of CAB APL 1 ( APL1A including CITCM, CITCAR and CITCD and&#13;
APL- 1B) is to establish a regional broadband network across Cameroon, CAR and Chad.&#13;
This broadband network will reduce significantly the cost of international connectivity.&#13;
This will have a direct economic impact through additional investment, value added, and&#13;
employment and as a generator of tax revenues. It will also have an indirect economic&#13;
impact through increased productivity of the public and private sectors (e.g. improved&#13;
public service delivery).&#13;

3.     The opportunity cost was calculated to measure the global economies from&#13;
the cost of providing bandwidth relying on Satellite connection as compared to the&#13;
cost of providing bandwidth relying on CAB connection. As suggested in the table&#13;
below under the assumption of a discount rate of 13percent and an average annual&#13;
decrease of 8 percent for satellite connection, the actual opportunity cost is estimated at&#13;
more than $117 million: $34 million for Cameroon, $26 million for CAR and $58 million&#13;
for Chad.&#13;
                                                                    Total discounted opportunity cost&#13;
                                         Chad                                     $58&#13;
                                      Cameroon                                    $34&#13;
                                          CAR                                     $26&#13;
                                          CAB                                    $117&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         50&#13;
&amp;#12;4.       The estimated opportunity cost is a decreasing function of the annual decrease in&#13;
satellite connection prices An average annual decrease of 21.6 percent of satellite&#13;
connection prices between 2011 and 2021 would jeopardize the competitiveness of the&#13;
CAB Program and would therefore produce a 0 (zero) opportunity cost.&#13;
&#13;
5.     The CAB Program in general will provide a major boost to the broadband market&#13;
through increasing usage of broadband in public institutions, in the private sector and for&#13;
consumers. CAB APL1 will significantly reduce the cost of international connectivity.&#13;
The project will stimulate the market and the overall economy. The effect of the project is&#13;
therefore to accelerate the development of the broadband market. It is estimated the&#13;
backbone will carry more that 23,000 E1 in 2021.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.      The estimates of economic impact are based on a 10 year model of the broadband&#13;
market in Cameroon, CAR and Chad. Broadband Internet is a new industry in Africa and&#13;
there are very few countries with advanced broadband markets on which to base&#13;
economic calculations. The economic impact is based on a micro-economic analysis&#13;
calculating the social welfare as the sum of the consumer surplus and producer surplus.&#13;
The consumer surplus is calculated as the amount that consumers benefit by being able to&#13;
purchase a product for a price that is less than they would be willing to pay. The&#13;
producer surplus is computed as amount that producers benefit by selling at a market&#13;
price mechanism that is higher than they would be willing to sell for. The graph below&#13;
gives a snapshot of the economic methodology used in this paragraph.&#13;

            Chad - Central African Backbone Program
            Communications and Infrastructure Technology Adaptable
            Program Loan (APL) Project : technical annex

            The objective of the Central African
            Backbone Program Communications and Infrastructure
            Technology Adaptable Program Loan (APL) Project is to
            contribute to increase geographical reach and usage of
            regional broadband network services and reduce their prices.
            There are two components to the project, the first component
            being enabling environment. This component will finance
            various activities in the form of technical assistance (TA),
            training and equipments in order to: (i) modernize the
            Information and Communication Technology (ICT) policy,
            legal, and regulatory environment; (ii) strengthen key
            public institutions; and (iii) promote a pro-competitive
            environment and restructure of Incumbent operators. This
            component is a key for the effective establishment of the
            Central African backbone network. Finally, the second
            component is the project management capability. This
            component will consist in financing project management
            related issues. It will support the following activities:
            (a) consultants to staff the Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
            (i.e., a procurement specialist, a financial manager, an
            internal auditor, an accountant, and a backbone expert); (b)
            equipments (i.e., financial management system); (c) various
            TA; (d) training; and (e) operating expenses.
