Message from the President of the World Bank and&#13;
Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors&#13;
The poverty reduction agenda has advanced signifi-&#13;
cantly over the past year, with development partners  i&#13;
coming together as never before. We must now build      I&#13;
on that momentum. Progress in reducing poverty  \&#13;
remains slow too many girls still do not go to  _ &#13;
school, too many children die before the age of five,  '             ,         ,   O  .&#13;
and too many poor people lack opportunity                       e\       A .               '&#13;

of the world's people live on less than $2 a day, and  '&lt;!l,&#13;
their numbers will grow in the next 25 years, as     7                                          -=&#13;
nearly two billion more people are added to develop-&#13;
ing countries' populations. The stakes are high, as  /&#13;
poverty touches all-and drives prospects for no less T&#13;
than global peace How can we scale up successes ,&#13;
enough to meet the international development goals  -&#13;
for 2015? (See page 4 ) Only with concerted action&#13;
can we make a difference.&#13;

a To better capture the evolving nature of Bank operations, the Bank's sector classification system is reviewed and changed as appropriate In fiscal 2000, two new&#13;
sector categories were created (Economic Policy and Private Sector Development) and one sector category was dropped (Industry) Economic Policy comprises oper-&#13;
ations that support macroeconomic poiicy, trade, and other economic and institutional reforms It includes structural adjustment operations previously assigned to&#13;
Multisector and some operations previousiy assigned to Finance Private Sector Development comprises operations dealing with the business environment, private&#13;
infrastructure, small scale enterprise, and privatization issues As such, it includes some operations previously assigned to Industry and to Public Sector Management&#13;
Other operations previously included under Industry have been assigned to the Public Sector Management sector In addition, a few individual operations approved&#13;
in fiscal 1998-99 were reassigned, including a fiscal 1999 project from Agriculture to Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;
b This column shows lending by sector, based on a classification by major loan component The example of a $100 million public sector loan,with components&#13;
aimed at addressing environmental, financial, and social protection needs, serves as an illustration In the case of loan-by-loan classification, the full amount of the&#13;
loan appears in the Public Sector Management sector, in the component classification, the full amount is split among the four sectors-Public Sector Management,&#13;
Environment, Finance, and Social Protection As a result, total lending of $1,882 7 million for Social Protection in the component classification is the sum of all&#13;
social protection components within loans approved in fiscal 2001&#13;

Box m.i The Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program (MAP)&#13;
for Africa&#13;
The HIV/AIDS epidemic now poses the paramount threat to&#13;
development in Sub-Saharan Africa. About 25 million adults and                 \Pi&#13;
children are living with HIV/AIDS, as estimated by the joint              , a&#13;

In collaboration with partners (see page 103), the Bank                    K       :&#13;

The MAP seeks to dramatically increase access-especially                                   \X&#13;
by vulnerable groups-to HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and         -&#13;

Communities and associations of people affected by&#13;
HIV/AIDS will help design and implement activities and will    l    J &#13;

arrival of foreign banks, competition has intensified in the&#13;

changed, with a civil service mentality progressively replaced&#13;

profitable, have better-quality balance sheets, and have&#13;
improved their services to customers.&#13;

HIV/AIDS: Prevention Is Vital&#13;
Today 36 million people are infected&#13;
with HIV; more than 21 million have died&#13;
of AI DS since the 1980s; and over 13&#13;
million children have been orphaned by&#13;
the disease.&#13;
As a cosponsor of the Joint United&#13;
Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS&#13;
(UNAIDS), the World Bank has commit-&#13;
ted more resources to HIV/AIDS in fiscal&#13;
2001 than in any previous year. Other&#13;
sections of this Annual Report discuss&#13;
the Bank's support to Africa (page 27)&#13;
and work with partners (page 103).&#13;

current level of investment.&#13;

b Countries are eligible for IDA on the basis of (a) relative poverty and (b) lack of creditworthiness The operational cutoff for IDA eligibility for fiscal 2002 is a&#13;
2000 GNI per capita of $885, using Atlas methodology To receive IDA resources, countries also meet tests of performance In exceptional circumstances, IDA&#13;
extends eligibility temporarily to countries that are above the operational cutoff and are undertaking major adjustment efforts but are not creditworthy for IBRD&#13;
lending An exception has been made for small island economies (see footnote c)&#13;
c During the IDA-12 period (fiscal 2000-02), an exception to the GNI per capita operational cutoff for IDA eligibility ($885 for fiscal 2002) has been made for&#13;
some small island economies, which otherwise would have little or no access to Bank Group assistance because they lack creditworthiness For such countries,&#13;
IDA funding is considered case by case for the financing of projects and adjustment programs designed to strengthen creditworthiness&#13;

            This Annual Report covers the period
            from July 1, 2000, to June 30, 2001, and details the World
            Bank strategy for meeting the poverty challenge. After the
            Introduction, Chapter 1 provides an overview of Bank
            activities in 2001 that focused on multi-dimensional
            support, improved development effectiveness, increased
            funding volume, formalized the country business model,
            evolved country assistance strategies by preparing them in
            consultation, developed investment vehicles to support
            low-income countries, created a task force to consider the
            response to the needs of middle-income countries, developed
            an innovative IBRD and IDA program and project lending to
            support strong national programs, assessment of the
            Strategic Compact, the use of the World Bank Institute to
            empower through knowledge and setting out a strategic
            framework for future directions. Chapter 2 describes the
            role of the Board of Executive Directors. Chapter 3 examines
            the thematic issues the Bank is tackling, such as addressing
            the social, institutional, and economic dimensions of
            poverty; investing in people; supporting private sector
            development; building strong financial systems; and building
            effective legal and judicial systems. Chapter 4 discusses
            the Bank's role in fighting poverty and aiding
            development region by region. Chapter 5 looks at Bank
            project performance. Chapter 6 focuses on Bank partnerships,
            Chapter 7 sums up approved projects, and Chapter 8 provides
            organizational information. This report is in 2 volumes.
            Volume 2 comprises the complete Management's Discussion
            and Analysis, audited financial statements, and appendices.
