ARID LANDS RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   The predominantly pastoralist populations in the eight arid districts of Kenya are counted&#13;
amongst the poorest and the most disadvantaged sections of society. Social welfare indicators show&#13;
that in terms of access to communications, public health, nutrition and education services they receive a&#13;
low fraction of services than the level available to the rest of the Kenyan population. Although the Arid&#13;
Lands (ALs) are well-endowed with livestock resources, in the absence of reliable marketing outlets&#13;
the full benefit of this resource accrues neither to the pastoralists nor to the consumers in the rest of the&#13;
country.&#13;
1.2   Existing constraints on socio-economic development in these districts are quite forbidding: the&#13;
physical environment is fragile and easily degraded; water resources are poor and variable; drought is a&#13;
recurring feature decimating up to 50 percent or more of the livestock in each severe occurrence; the&#13;
road network is inadequate and poorly maintained; and levels of illiteracy are high as are the child&#13;
mortality rates. Experience has shown that traditional nomadic pastoralist communities like many other&#13;
communities do not always adequately respond to the top-down development process; while a few&#13;
formal and community-based institutions have limited capacities to combat the prevailing constraints.&#13;
1.3    Neither effective conservation of the natural resource base nor the development potential of&#13;
these areas can be realized unless these constraints are addressed. Further, the development process&#13;
should accommodate the shifts in priorities from development to survival in times of drought and vice-&#13;
versa when normalcy returns. The proposed project addresses these constraints by focusing on drought&#13;
management and mitigation, further integration of the AL population into the mainstream of the&#13;
country's economy and the promotion of community-driven small-scale initiatives to address their&#13;
development priorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
2. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. MACRO ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT&#13;
2.1    Kenya is a low-income country with a per capita income of $260 in 1994 (at current prices and&#13;
exchange rates). About 75 percent of the country's land area is classified as arid or semi-anrd. The&#13;
economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, and in the arid lands, which comprise 60 percent of the&#13;
land area of the country, livestock is the main economic activity of the largely pastoralist population.&#13;
2.2    Between 1991 and 1993, Kenya's macroeconomic performance was poor. In April 1992 the&#13;
Government agreed with the Intemational Monetary Fund (IMF) on a program of actions necessary to&#13;
re-establish a sound macroeconomic framework which included deficit reduction, monetary restraint&#13;
and liberalization of the foreign exchange regime. Until mid- 1993 the implementation of the actions&#13;
required was unsatisfactory: though fiscal targets were basically met, monetary targets were&#13;
significantly exceeded and the liberalization of the foreign exchange regime proved to be unsustainable.&#13;
2.3    However, since mid-1993 there has been a significant improvement in macroeconomic&#13;
management: the monetary policy was tightened considerably; and the official and market interest rates&#13;
were unified. These improvements allowed the Government to negotiate a three year Policy&#13;
Framework Paper (PFP) with the Bank and the Fund supported by a one-year Enhanced Structural&#13;
Adjustment Facility (ESAF) arrangement with the IMF. The Government's performance under the&#13;
reform program was generally positive, but with slippages in some areas. The fiscal deficit was in line&#13;
with overall targets, but weak expenditure control necessitated expenditure and revenue adjustments to&#13;
keep the deficit within agreed ceilings. On the structural side, virtually all exchange controls were&#13;
abolished, the exchange rate was floated, price controls lifted and the maize market liberalized ahead of&#13;
schedule. On the other hand, civil service reform got off to a slow start and parastatal reform lagged&#13;
significantly. The economy responded positively to these measures, with the exchange rate&#13;
appreciating, reserve levels increasing, inflation declining, and a restoration of positive real growth&#13;
estimated at 3 percent in 1994. The Govemment successfully completed the 1994 ESAF arrangement&#13;
and has been discussing a new Policy Framework Paper (covering the period 1995 to 1997) with the&#13;
Bank and the Fund. The proposed framework will seek to sustain fiscal adjustment and accelerate&#13;
structural reforms, notably in the parastatal area.&#13;
B. SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
2.4    Agriculture is the single largest sector of the Kenyan economy, accounting for about one-&#13;
quarter of GDP and 70 percent of employment. It makes an indirect contribution of another 30 percent&#13;
of GDP through the manufacturing and service sectors. Also two-thirds of the industrial output in the&#13;
country is agro-industry based. Historically, the performance of the agricultural sector in Kenya has&#13;
been better than the average for sub-Saharan Africa. Growth rate was 6.2 percent in 1965 through&#13;
1973, it was 4.6 percent in 1974-80 and declined to 2.5 percent in the period between 1981 and 1987.&#13;
The situation has worsened since 1988. The agricultural growth was 1.6 percent in the period 1988-92;&#13;
and it was negative in 1992 and 1993. This downtum in agricultural growth resulted largely from poor&#13;
rainfall, and the slow implementation of structural reforms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
2.5    The physical challenges to increasing agricultural growth are formidable. There is very little&#13;
high potential agricultural land left in the country which is not already being cropped or grazed, leaving&#13;
intensification of land use as the only available option. The fragile drier areas of the country are&#13;
experiencing the adverse environmental consequences of rapid population increases and the use of&#13;
inappropriate technologies. Sedentarization of these lands which reduces the available land for dry&#13;
season grazing has caused deepening poverty among the mainly pastoralist people of the ALs. The&#13;
impact of such sedentarization is to further reduce the dry season grazing areas available to the&#13;
livestock in times of drought.&#13;
2.6    Kenya's agriculture has the potential to grow at around 4 percent per annum provided the&#13;
policy and institutional inadequacies are minimized. The reform agenda should be governed by the&#13;
principle of clearly defining a policy environment based on developing competitive markets for&#13;
agricultural commodities. The livestock sector can play an important role in meeting Kenya's overall&#13;
growth objectives. Livestock is the primary economic activity in the arid lands and is an important&#13;
activity in the remaining areas of the country. Beef provides about 65 percent of meat production in the&#13;
country and small stock and camels, provide the remainder. Small stock and camels predominate in the&#13;
arid lands, providing the major source of cash income to that area besides being the most important&#13;
element of food of the AL populations. Livestock marketing and prices were decontrolled in 1987 but&#13;
the ALs have not been able to benefit from the improved market conditions pnrmarily because of poor&#13;
infrastructural linkages with the main consuming centers.&#13;
2.7    Kenya has also initiated activities to deal with the pressing environmental issues. The country is&#13;
faced with the stark reality that there is a growing gap between the rapidly growing population and a&#13;
fragile natural resource base which is shrinking through degradation and overuse.  A National&#13;
Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), which inter alia, addresses the environmental impact of poverty,&#13;
agricultural intensification, exploitation of water resources, management of biological resources and&#13;
bio-diversity, energy and transport initiatives and plans, industry, mining and urbanization is now being&#13;
implemented. The NEAP also addresses a number of issues facing the pastoralists in the ALs. These&#13;
include, pressures placed on fragile natural resources because of sedentarization, the loss of important&#13;
dry season grazing areas because of inappropriate agricultural development and settlement, the&#13;
breakdown of customary controls over the use of common property resources, and constraints in the&#13;
use of traditional stock routes.&#13;
C. THE AREA AND PEOPLE&#13;
2.8    The ALs cover over 60 percent of Kenya's total land area. The total population of the eight AL&#13;
districts of Turkana, Marsabit, Mandera, Wajir, Samburu, Isiolo, Garissa, Tana River and the arid&#13;
divisions of Baringo numbers about one million people, i.e. about 4.6 percent of the total Kenyan&#13;
population. The ALs fall mainly within Kenya's agro-ecological zones VI and VII and have the&#13;
following physical characteristics. Zone VI which accounts for 22 percent of Kenya's land area has a&#13;
rainfall to evapotranspiration ratio between 15-20 percent and is classified as arid lands. Zone VII,&#13;
which accounts for 41 percent of Kenya's land area has a rainfall to evapotranspiration ratio of less than&#13;
15 percent and is classified as very arid. Zone VI areas receive between 300-500 mm rainfall annually&#13;
and zone VII between 200-300 mm. The soils in ALs are highly variable, generally of light and&#13;
medium texture and are shallow. In general they are subject to compaction and capping and are&#13;
susceptible to erosion. Surface water resources are scarce and highly variable. These regions have a&#13;
low capability of supporting vegetation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
2.9   Pastoralism is the predominant occupation in the ALs. Pastoral communities in these districts&#13;
belong to closely-knit tribal groups which have been rival herdsmen for ages. The major tribal groups&#13;
are Turkanas in Turkana district; Samburus and Turkanas in Samburu district; Borans in Isiolo district;&#13;
Borans, Gabra and Rendille in Marsabit; and Somalis of six main clans in Garissa, Mandera and Wajir&#13;
districts.  The people are predominantly  semi-nomadic or nomadic pastoralists, though some&#13;
sedentarization has started to occur. The ability of pastoral communities to survive through periods of&#13;
drought has been highly dependent on their capacity to spread their risks, to move on to new areas of&#13;
grazing as resources are depleted, and to take advantage of highly diverse dry land environments&#13;
(riverine woodlands, hilltop forests, dispersed watering points, and so on).  Extensive seasonal&#13;
movements in response to scarcity or abundance of resources have featured prominently as part of&#13;
pastoral survival strategies.&#13;
2.10   The ability of the AL populations to continue their pastoral way of life has come under&#13;
increasing pressure in the last two decades, as access to the dry-season grazing areas has been lost to&#13;
agriculture and settled ranching in the neighboring semi-arid lands. There are increasing trends of&#13;
pastoralists sedentarizing around water points in the ALs as well. Consequently, the overall carrying&#13;
capacity of the ALs has been reduced, a feature which has been exacerbated by tribal conflicts. The&#13;
growing inability of these lands to sustain their human and livestock population is highlighted during&#13;
recurrent droughts which decimate up to 50 percent or more of the livestock population in each severe&#13;
occurrence. Pastoralists are increasingly migrating to the nearest towns during droughts in search of&#13;
water and relief food. These population centers are ill-equipped to serve as drought mitigation centers&#13;
or to support post-drought recovery.&#13;
2.11   Almost the entire population in the ALs can be classified as below the poverty line. For&#13;
example, the ALs have fewer than 2.2 doctors and 15 nurses per 100,000 population compared with&#13;
the national average of 15 and 25 respectively; about 43 percent of the primary school-age children in&#13;
the ALs enroll in schools compared with the national average of 95 percent, literacy in the AL districts&#13;
is estimated at below 20 percent, compared with the national average of 69 percent, and infant&#13;
mortality is almost twice the national average. Further, the trends in infant and child mortality rates&#13;
show little signs of improvement; education and literacy figures also show little improvement over the&#13;
years. School dropout rates are high: one survey in Turkana showed that less than 10 percent of those&#13;
enrolled in Standard I stayed in school until Standard 8. In terms of infrastructure the ALs are poorly&#13;
served by roads and have limited access to sources of energy. The ALs have 40 km of roads per 1000&#13;
sq. km, while the average for other areas is almost 200 kmi; the AL populations consume less than one-&#13;
hundredth of the average per capita electrical power consumption.&#13;
2.12   The ALs contribution to the national economy is substantially below its potential.  Situated&#13;
farthest from the principal Govemment and commercial centers in the north and east of the country in a&#13;
region of poor infrastructure, the AL populations are isolated from the social and economic mainstream&#13;
of the country. Consequently, their access to markets for livestock products, the main economic assets&#13;
of these populations, is poor. This situation has been further aggravated by social conflicts, which have&#13;
rendered the traditional stockroutes unreliable. Thus a population of around one million people with&#13;
very little linkages with the rest of the economy, faces a deteriorating natural resource base, declining&#13;
food security and deepening poverty. That situation is, nevertheless, reversible. The area has&#13;
considerable untapped potential arising from its rich endowment in livestock: the eight arid districts&#13;
contain nearly 20 percent of country's cattle, 30 percent of sheep, nearly 50 percent of goats and&#13;
donkeys and almost the entire camel population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
D. POLICY ENVIRONMENT&#13;
2.13   The Govemment has had a well-articulated Arid and Semi-Arid Land (ASAL) policy since&#13;
1979 when an official document' set out the ASAL policy framework for the 1980's. The main&#13;
objectives were stated as resource conservation, exploitation of productive potential, development of&#13;
human resources and integration of the ASAL into the national economy. These policy objectives have&#13;
been upheld and elaborated in subsequent policy documents, mainly the 1989-93 National&#13;
Development Plan and a revised ASAL policy document issued in 19922.  This document places&#13;
substantial emphasis on drought contingency planning in order to strengthen the coping mechanisms of&#13;
local communities. Guidelines for policy implementation emphasize that projects and programs will be&#13;
undertaken within the District Focus Strategy; and communities and local institutions will be involved&#13;
in design, preparation and implementation of the projects.&#13;
2.14   Three major concems, however, are not fully reflected in either Govemment policies or&#13;
program initiatives. First, the Government has not yet enunciated a national policy on drought&#13;
management for the ALs. The current policy outline does not fully address the issues faced by the&#13;
pastoralist populations in these areas. The Government formulated a "drought contingency action plan"&#13;
and a "food security action plan" under the Bank-financed Second Agricultural Sector Adjustment&#13;
Operation (ASAO II, Cr. 2204-KE), but these drafts were neither adopted nor operationalized.&#13;
Similarly, several recommendations on drought management made in the Kenya Food and Nutrition&#13;
Policy Report (Report No. 8351-KE) have not been acted upon. The drought management efforts in&#13;
the past have been mostly limited to the securing of food and other relief supplies from donors and their&#13;
distribution to drought-affected populations. Second, there is a need to evolve specific policy initiatives&#13;
for addressing issues concerning the detenrorating natural resource base in the ALs. There is a need for&#13;
educating and mobilizing communities to prevent natural resource degradation. The pastoralist&#13;
communities in the ALs are not adequately protected by tenurial and grazing rights. Some interventions&#13;
such as the installation of large boreholes as permanent water points are known to have caused harm to&#13;
the environment. Third, the Government is implementing The Land Adjudication Act (Cap 284) in&#13;
Samburu, Isiolo and Marsabit districts under which common land is adjudicated and titles given to&#13;
individuals. Though the process is very slow and limited to certain areas, the impact of this land&#13;
redistribution on the pastoral communities needs to be studied. In addition, a policy framework needs&#13;
to be in place for appropriate program initiatives to be developed (para 3.8).&#13;
2.15   Furthermore, most of the laws relevant to the development of ALs have been in effect since&#13;
colonial days. Since the development policy in Kenya has changed fundamentally between the colonial&#13;
times and the present, there is every probability that such laws are not consistent with the current&#13;
policy. There is therefore a need for the Government to carry out a thorough review of all laws and&#13;
regulations pertaining to ALs and to assess whether such laws are adequate in implementing&#13;
Govemment policy and protecting the rights of the pastoralists. Such a review should also cover the&#13;
enforcement mechanism of the laws in question (para 3.8).&#13;

E. INSTITUTIONAL SETTING&#13;
2.16   The Ministry of Land Reclamation, Regional and Water Development (MLRRWD) and the&#13;
Office of the President (OP) have the main responsibilities for policy and programs in ASALs.&#13;
MLRRWD handles the policy development for ASALs, OP is in-charge of drought policy and the&#13;
coordination of programs concerning drought management, relief and rehabilitation. It is also in charge&#13;
of district, regional and national administration which are in charge of carrying out Government&#13;
programs. Recently the Government has strengthened institutional capacity for drought and relief&#13;
operations by establishing a separate Department of Relief and Rehabilitation (DRR) in the OP headed&#13;
by a Permanent Secretary. The only Bank-funded project in the ALs, the Emergency Drought&#13;
Recovery Project (EDRP - CR. 2460-KE) is housed in DRR. The Drought Recovery Programme is&#13;
integrated into the institutional structure of the Office of the President. In the field, the program is&#13;
coordinated by district program coordinators reporting to the District Commissioner (DC).&#13;
2.17  The Government of Kenya has adopted the District Focus Strategy (DFS) for implementing&#13;
rural development initiatives. The DFS is intended to decentralize management responsibilities&#13;
(including planning and monitoring) to the district, which is the smallest management unit within the&#13;
Kenyan institutional structure containing key technical and financial mechanisms to plan and implement&#13;
development activities. However, the implementation experience of several projects such as the IDA-&#13;
funded Baringo sub-project of the Rural Services Design Project (Cr. 1974-KE), IFAD-financed&#13;
Kwale-Kilifi District Development Project, and the Coast ASAL Development Project, shows that&#13;
generally the ministries did not adequately delegate functional authority to the districts commensurate&#13;
with their role envisaged under the DFS.&#13;
F. PAST AND ONGOING PROGRAMS IN THE AREA&#13;
2.18   A number of multilateral and bilateral projects have been introduced in the ASALs in the last&#13;
two decades. With the exception of a few, these have largely focused on the relatively better off sermi-&#13;
arid lands. The only major investment effort supported by IDA in the arid lands is the EDRP which is&#13;
being implemented in five arid districts, namely Mandera, Marsabit, Turkana, Wajir, and Tana River.&#13;
Details of these projects are summarized in Annex 2 along with constraints faced in implementation.&#13;
G. LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
2.19   Both the successes and failures of the current and past development interventions in ALs,&#13;
described in Annex 2, have lessons for the proposed project. The first lesson is that in these&#13;
predominantly pastoralist communities, characterized by strong tribal and clan structures, sustainable&#13;
development would not be possible unless the objectives addressed by the project are articulated by the&#13;
community. Community ownership of the project is essential for sustainability. This will occur only if&#13;
the community has an effective say in decision making. The second lesson is that project interventions&#13;
should be simple enough that communities can manage them. The technologies used should be low-&#13;
cost, i.e., affordable, to ensure sustainability. The third lesson is that the program should expand only&#13;
as the absorptive capacities of the districts and the communities improve. The fourth lesson is that&#13;
building capacities of the communities, participating NGOs and the Government's institutional&#13;
structures should receive high priority for the development interventions to succeed. Human resource&#13;
development should be regarded as a key input for the community development interventions. Further,&#13;
in the arid lands, often susceptible to droughts and famine, the priorities of a community can oscillate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
between development and survival, the project objectives should take into account this requirement and&#13;
implementation should be dynamic and flexible enough to accommodate these changes.&#13;
2.20   The project should be executed within the framework of the Govemment's District Focus&#13;
Strategy. Centralized planning and management models applied to projects in high potential areas have&#13;
little chance of succeeding in these far-flung areas with poor capacities and communications. Programs&#13;
in the ALs where funds from donors (UNDP, bilateral) flow directly to the project implementers in the&#13;
field have performed well. The Bank/IDA funds however are channeled through the Govemment&#13;
budgetary and accounting process. The lesson is that an arrangement would need to be established&#13;
within these processes which is effective in securing the required incremental funds in the annual&#13;
budgets in order to adapt the delivery of government services to a community based model, followed&#13;
by a mechanism for planning at the community and district level and subsequent flow of funds to the&#13;
implementing agencies. The time span of the project should be sufficiently long to establish durable&#13;
relationships between implementers and communities by building an adapted model of delivery of&#13;
services to these nomadic communities.&#13;
H. PROJECT PREPARATION&#13;
2.21   The lessons learned have been applied during project preparation, in project design and the&#13;
proposed implementation arrangements. Initial project preparation was undertaken by a Government&#13;
inter-ministerial planning team. At appraisal, all the target districts were visited and several planning&#13;
workshops held to involve field implementers in the design of the project. With regard to&#13;
implementation procedures, the workshops examined the applicability of the proposed procedures in&#13;
the context of existing implementation capacities in the target districts. In addition to the participants in&#13;
the workshops, field agencies, some local NGOs and bilateral donor-funded initiatives in these areas&#13;
were also consulted.&#13;
2.22   Attempts were also made to involve potential beneficiaries in the final project preparation&#13;
exercises. The initial guidelines for community participation were developed by undertaking&#13;
community-oriented planning exercises with pastoralist communities on location. Community&#13;
participation has thus been fostered through following a bottom-up approach and beneficiary&#13;
involvement in project design. The experience of the Drought Monitoring System under the&#13;
Netherlands-supported Drought Management Project was pilot tested in a training workshop in one of&#13;
the target districts and the results incorporated in the design of the drought management component. In&#13;
the mid-term review of the EDRP, several beneficiary participation initiatives have been included and&#13;
strengthened which would evolve into the Arid Land Resource Management Project (ALRMP)&#13;
programs. Finally the project design allows for a phased approach, which would permit project&#13;
implementation in two stages: launching and slow build-up of activities in stage one, followed by full&#13;
deployment of activities in all the districts in stage two, incorporating the lessons learned during a&#13;
comprehensive mid-term review. This would match implementation to the capacities of implementers,&#13;
and afford opportunities for applying mid-course corrections.&#13;
1. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.23   The project is consistent with the Bank's Country, Sector and Environmental strategies, and&#13;
supports the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), discussed by the Board in April 1994; it is also&#13;
consistent with the current 1995 CAS. The focus of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
poverty reduction through accelerated growth and employment generation. This strategy&#13;
emphasizes macroeconomic stability, improved public sector efficiency and development of an&#13;
export-oriented private sector, as well as strengthening the basis for equitable and sustainable&#13;
development by addressing longer-term human resource issues and arresting the deterioration of&#13;
Kenya's fragile environment. The CAS seeks to advance such objectives through the country&#13;
dialogue, and by supporting efforts to alleviate population pressures and develop the ASALs, as part of&#13;
the country assistance program. ALRMP's components and implementation strategy are thus im&#13;
accordance with the CAS; the project specifically supports the CAS objective of strengthening the&#13;
basis for equitable and environmentally sustainable economic development. With its focus on&#13;
providing basic social services and environmental protection, the proposed ALRMP is a central&#13;
feature of IDA's "core" lending program. The proposed ALRMP is a Program of Targeted&#13;
Interventions, aimed at assisting the pastoralists in the arid districts, who are counted among the&#13;
poorest of Kenya's population. It seeks to reduce the chronic poverty and enhance food security&#13;
in these districts, at the same time strengthening and supporting local community-driven initiatives&#13;
to better manage dry woodlands, critical grazing reserves and other fragile environments in these&#13;
arid areas. The project design draws from the findings and recommendations of the recently&#13;
finalized Kenya Poverty Assessment report, prepared by IDA in close consultation with the&#13;
Government and with the support of several donors. The proposed project incorporates&#13;
substantial beneficiary participation, and seeks to build capacity within local communities to take&#13;
advantage of development opportunities and assigns an active collaborative role to the NGOs and&#13;
other local social organizations/bodies. By emphasizing district-based initiatives, it supports&#13;
decentralized planning and implementation. The proposed ALRMP is also a logical follow-up to&#13;
the ongoing EDRP which has successfully initiated various environmentally sustainable drought&#13;
management and mitigation activities in the ALs. These activities would be expanded and&#13;
strengthened under the proposed project. Project implementation strategy and components have&#13;
been designed in accordance with the Government's stated policies on ASAL development, and&#13;
proposed project initiatives would be underpinned by the ongoing implementation of the&#13;
National Environment Action Plan (NEAP).&#13;

3.   THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1   The objectives of the Project are to strengthen and support community driven initiatives to: (a)&#13;
reduce the widespread poverty and enhance food security in the arid districts of Turkana, Marsabit,&#13;
Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, Tana River, Isiolo, Samburu, and the arid divisions of Baringo District; and&#13;
(b) conserve the natural resource base in the arid lands through: (i) improving crop and livestock&#13;
resilience to drought; (ii) increasing econormic linkages with  the rest of the economy; and (iii)&#13;
improving basic health services, water supply and other social services.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.2   Summary Description: The project would have three components:&#13;
(a)    Drought Management: This component would institutionalize at the national and&#13;
district levels a structure to effectively manage all the phases of drought. These include&#13;
preparedness (drought monitoring), rnitigation (drought contingency planning and rapid&#13;
reaction) and recovery (continued drought relief activities). The project will build on&#13;
the successful model for drought monitoring piloted under the previous project;&#13;
(b)   Marketing and Infrastructure: This component would address the bottlenecks that&#13;
impede livestock market linkages between the ALs and the rest of the national&#13;
economy; and,&#13;
Community Development (CD): In order to become fully responsive to the&#13;
communities' priority needs and demands, this component would be instrumental&#13;
in assisting line ministries and collaborating agencies to adapt their organization&#13;
and delivery systems to the specific conditions of the ALs.&#13;
3.3 Detailed Project Description: An overview of each of the three project components is as follows:&#13;
3.4   Drought Management (US$ 10.9 million including contingencies): This component&#13;
will:&#13;
(a)   Establish at the national and district level policy and operational responsibilities for&#13;
drought management in Kenya. As a first step, the project will implement a Drought&#13;
Monitoring System which has been tested successfully under EDRP. The Department for&#13;
Relief and Rehabilitation will monitor through this system a representative sample of the entire&#13;
and land population on a monthly basis. The objective of the monitoring system is to detect&#13;
specific drought related risks and to warn decision makers at both the district and the national&#13;
level as early as possible so that immediate and targeted actions can be taken by the relevant&#13;
line ministries to mitigate these risks. As part of policy development, national and district level&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
manuals and contingency plans would be developed to enhance strategic planning for the&#13;
management of drought and famine&#13;
(b)    Establish: (i) a Drought Contingency Fund for immediate drought interventions to&#13;
finance the respective line ministries' specific emergency activities - incremental to their&#13;
routine delivery of services - to protect communities' livelihoods and to mitigate the negative&#13;
impact of risks at an early stage. An example is an emergency immunization campaign, (ii) an&#13;
Emergency Cereal Reserve to maintain small stocks at the district level to be used for&#13;
emergency food relief and food for work interventions to see through the initial period of&#13;
drought; and (iii) there is also a need to continue drought recovery activities (especially&#13;
around the urban centers) for people who have been made destitute by the 1993 drought. The&#13;
specific support that should be provided to these communities will be identified by the&#13;
communities themselves (with the assistance of a team of technicians of the respective line&#13;
departments) through Participatory Learning for Action (PLA) exercises, resulting in&#13;
community work plans&#13;
(c) The project would finance other drought preparedness and mitigation interventions&#13;
such as the establishment of dry season and drought grazing reserves and strategic water&#13;
supplies. Communities would plan and participate in the implementation of these mitigation&#13;
interventions. To facilitate the flow of goods and services, the project will also assist in the&#13;
maintenance of road infrastructure through the Ministry of Public Works, with a view to&#13;
establishing labor intensive road maintenance activities which can be used as food for work&#13;
initiatives during periods of drought, initially as a pilot activity.&#13;
3.5    Marketing and Infrastructure (US$ 3.4 million): Under this component a community&#13;
based approach will be used to determine actions which can be taken to create an improved&#13;
marketing environment. These actions may include: (a) rehabilitation of stock routes, water&#13;
points and other infrastructure facilities; (b) development of new and rehabilitation of existing&#13;
market-related infrastructure, including animal holding grounds, animal marketing centers and&#13;
slaughter houses; (c) improvement and strengthening of the Livestock Marketing Information&#13;
System; and (d) development of user-related initiatives in marketing of animals. The marketing of&#13;
other products such as hides and skins or gum arabic could also be included. Training and&#13;
capacity building in relation to the management and operation of community facilities, the&#13;
formation of herders associations would be an integral part of this component.&#13;
3.6    Community Development (US$ 5.9 million): This component is designed to achieve the&#13;
fundamental objective of increasing the communities' capacities to protect and develop their&#13;
livelihoods by dealing with the drought cycles in an effective way. The CD Component will be&#13;
implemented following a phased or pilot approach in four arid districts over a four year period&#13;
initially. Provided the findings at mid-term are positive, CD would be continued for the full project&#13;
term of six years and its coverage will be extended to the remaining districts. The project will be&#13;
instrumental in assisting each of the line ministries involved to improve and adapt their mode of&#13;
intervention and organization to the specific conditions in the ALs so as to become responsive to&#13;
the communities' specific needs and demands. Participatory Learning for Action (PLA) is the&#13;
major tool to confirm the assessment of what the communities consider to be their priorities and&#13;
to take into account socio economic, environmental and other differences between various areas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- I 1 -&#13;
in order to tailor and adapt the line ministries' service delivery system in the entire district. PLA&#13;
teams (two per district), will be constituted to carry out this exercise in selected communities (see&#13;
annex 5). Practical proposals have been elaborated by each of the line ministries during project&#13;
preparation (see annex 6). The line ministries will be expected to maintain or if necessary increase&#13;
their funding levels to successfully adapt their service delivery to the conditions of the arid lands&#13;
and to manage the drought cycle. During project implementation, each of the district line&#13;
departments will continue to improve and refine its organization on the basis of local conditions&#13;
and field experience. The District Steering Group (DSG) will identify which local NGOs and&#13;
other local organizations can be involved as implementers and trainers. The following is a&#13;
summary of delivery systems related to services already demanded by communities:&#13;
(a)    Animal Health and Livestock Production. The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock&#13;
Development and Marketing (MOALDM) will focus on the support of Community Animal&#13;
Health Workers (CAWHs, about 100 per district) who will (a) sell basic animal drugs in their&#13;
community, (b) act as the first line animal health care, and (c) serve as "contact pastoralists"&#13;
for the dissemination of technical messages related to the improvement of the herders' capacity&#13;
to manage their livestock. These messages will relate to issues including disease prevention,&#13;
vaccination, and husbandry practices (such as control of parasites). The CAWHs will have the&#13;
possibility every month to meet with the front line staff of the departments of veterinary&#13;
services and livestock production for consultation and training.&#13;
(b)   Crop Production Support to crop production will be provided by the existing front&#13;
line extension staff (maximum 40 per district) from MOALDM. Due to the particular&#13;
circumstances - agriculture in ALs is generally being practiced in small, very well defined&#13;
"pockets" which can vary in size - the ratio of front line extension staff per farm families should&#13;
not exceed one per two hundred. The front line staff will have regular meetings with farmers&#13;
to disseminate improved know how, and will benefit from monthly training and supervision&#13;
carried out respectively by the district based subject matter specialists and the district&#13;
agricultural officer.&#13;
(c)    Water  With regard to rural water supply, the focus of the Ministry of Land&#13;
Reclamation, Regional and Water Development (MLRRWD) will be on improving community&#13;
water supply systems and strengthening the community water users associations' capacity to&#13;
manage and maintain new and existing water points. At the district level, a tearn of trainers will&#13;
train members of the users associations with regard to management skills, operational&#13;
maintenance, book keeping, formulation of bylaws, environmental impact, etc. In addition, the&#13;
users associations will identify Community Water Workers - pump attendants, pipe fitters, line&#13;
patrollers, mechanics and electricians - to assure the maintenance of the installation. A&#13;
maintenance unit will be on call at the district level to react to demands from the respective&#13;
users associations to intervene for repairs surpassing the CWWs' capacity.&#13;
(d)   Health The Ministry of Health's (MOH) Primary Health Care Program is designed to&#13;
assure: (a) maximum mother and child welfare through the training of Traditional Birth&#13;
Attendants (TBA, 2 to 5 per community); (b) treatment of minor ailments, preventive and&#13;
educational services through Community Health Workers (CHWs, 15 to 20 for a population of&#13;
about 10,000 people), and; (c) treatment of ailments and Matemal and Child Healti/Family&#13;
Planning services through professional outreach teams (one per district). This strategy makes it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
possible to reach nomadic communities as well as settlements without any health facility.&#13;
Support to TBAs and CHWs is provided by division based Nomadic Primary Health Care&#13;
Teams.&#13;
(e)    Coordination The District Project Coordinator's role is critical to the success of the&#13;
implementation of this component: the line ministries can only successfully pursue the&#13;
adaptations that should be made to their organization and delivery system if they have strong&#13;
(and external) support to overcome the many difficulties en route. Although there are no&#13;
hierarchical links between the Coordinator and the heads of departments of the line ministries&#13;
at the district level, he/she will provide critical feed back regarding the efficiency of the&#13;
respective line ministries' field operations, and whatever guidance and support needed to&#13;
implement their program.&#13;
3.7    Training: Training constitutes one of the main activities under the program. Staff of each&#13;
of the respective line ministries will participate in initial training courses to master the&#13;
organizational changes and adaptations to the working methodology, and will benefit from&#13;
continuous refresher courses to stay up to date with the latest relevant technology. This training is&#13;
crucial to allow staff to provide, each in their field of expertise, the best quality of services&#13;
possible to the community members. Given the importance of the Participatory Learning for&#13;
Action for the identification and planning of support and services that should be provided by the&#13;
line ministries, special attention will go to the training of staff in the methodology and techniques&#13;
of PLA. During project preparation, each of the line ministries has outlined the broad framework&#13;
for the respective training programs. In the course of implementation, these programs will be&#13;
refined and further elaborated in practical training curricula and annual training programs. These&#13;
training activities will include: (a) training of planners, policy-makers, field implementers,&#13;
community leaders and other community members in implementation activities; (b) development&#13;
of appropriate curricula to conduct "under the tree" training courses for community members; (c)&#13;
training, including orientation courses, for middle- and senior-level civil servants on drought&#13;
management, livestock marketing and community development programs; and, (d) acquisition of&#13;
library books, manuals, teaching aids and other educational equipment where needed.&#13;
3.8    Studies: Under the project, studies will be carried out on the degradation of the natural&#13;
resource base and developing a policy and legal framework on natural resource conservation.&#13;
Mainly local consultants will be hired. Subjects for studies may include: (i) regulations and&#13;
practices on grazing rights; (ii) creating institutional and non-formal conflict-resolution&#13;
mechanisms, (iii) testing improved desert resource management technologies; (iv) implications of&#13;
sedentarization of stock routes and emergency grazing reserves (v) implications of dry season&#13;
grazing areas; (vi) regime of restriction of movement of cattle from the ALs to other parts of the&#13;
country: (vii) market information systems for livestock; and (viii) ways to involve the private&#13;
sector in the establishment of slaughter houses. In addition, a review of laws and regulations will&#13;
be carried out pertaining to the development of ALs, including a study on the land tenure system&#13;
and development of instruments to protect and enforce the tenurial rights of pastoralists in the&#13;
ALs. The Government has agreed to enter into a contract with a consulting firm before Credit&#13;
effectiveness to carry out these studies. The Government has furnished to IDA a Letter of&#13;

C. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
3.9 Estimated project costs are presented in Table 1. Project costs by year are given in Annex 7, and&#13;
detailed project costs breakdowns are presented in the PIP. Physical contingencies of 5 percent have&#13;
been added to selected project costs. Price contingencies corresponding to the Manufacturers Unit&#13;
Value Index3 have been applied to intemationally sourced items, and the projected domestic inflation&#13;
rate has been applied to locally sourced items. A constant purchasing parity exchange rate has been&#13;
calculated to adjust local price contingencies to US dollars. All costs are net of duties and taxes.&#13;

D. PROJECT PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
3.11   All procurement of goods, works and services would be in accordance with World Bank&#13;
Procurement Guidelines. Bank's standard bidding documents for goods, works and consultants would&#13;
be used. At negotiations agreement was reached on an initial procurement plan, including standard&#13;
procurement processing time and schedules for standard bidding documents for critical contracts.&#13;
(a)    Civil Works All contracts estimated to cost US$250,000 or more will be by ICB and below&#13;
this value will be by LCB. Civil works in each project district would cover new office&#13;
buildings (estimated cost US$250,000), spot improvement to roads (US$400,000) and&#13;
miscellaneous works associated wAth livestock infrastructure and drought management&#13;
(US$4.9 million). These works will be carried out district-wide over the project period on the&#13;
basis of annual work plans prepared by each district. For these works foreign firms will not be&#13;
interested and adequate competition exists among local contractors. Ordinary road repair works&#13;
each estimated to cost not more than US$50,000 will be carried out by the District Works&#13;
Offices (DWOs) using the acceptable force account method and employing local labor as far as&#13;
possible. For carrying out livestock infrastructure works (water pans, boreholes, fencing, civil&#13;
structures at holding grounds/market yards or along stock routes) and drought management&#13;
works (infrastructure for drought mitigation centers and livestock grazing reserves) the DSU&#13;
will engage an appropriate district agency (DWO, District Water Engineer) who will carry out&#13;
these works following force account as described for road improvement works. The aggregate&#13;
of works under force account will not be more than US$500,000.&#13;
(b)    Goods and Equipment  Procurement of goods under contracts estimated at US$100,000&#13;
equivalent or more will be done by ICB. For contracts less than US$100,000 equivalent LCB&#13;
procedures will be adopted. In the first two years of the project vehicles, computers, survey&#13;
equipment, radio equipment for the districts will be procured centrally by the National Support&#13;
Unit (NSU) through ICB with each contract estimated to cost US$100,000 or more&#13;
aggregating to US$2.5 million. Contracts below US$100,000 up to an aggregate of US$1.2&#13;
million will be procured by LCB by the districts in terms of requirements reflected in the&#13;
annual work plans. Small contracts of US$20,000 equivalent or less will use local shopping&#13;
procedures (a minimum of three quotations), with aggregate not to exceed US$200,000.&#13;
Under ICB, domestic manufacturers of goods will be allowed a margin of preference of 15&#13;
percent or the existing rate of import duty, whichever is lower, over the CIF price of the&#13;

competing foreign bidders. Fuel, oil and lubricants covered by the O&amp;M costs will be procured&#13;
according to normal Government procedures, which are satisfactory.&#13;
(c)    Community Development  The project envisages about 200 microprojects in the four pilot&#13;
districts in four years. In addition, the Marketing component also envisages small community&#13;
projects. These microprojects will be implemented following procedures described below. A&#13;
microproject would normally have a maximum project contribution of US$10,000 excluding a&#13;
minimum of 30 percent community share. At negotiations assurance was received that&#13;
beneficiary communities will provide a minimum of 30 percent of the microproject costs. The&#13;
microprojects will be executed by the line ministry, or a non-Government agency contracted to&#13;
carry-out the microproject as a Collaborating Agency.  Procurement procedures for the&#13;
nicroprojects would be normal GOK procedures acceptable to IDA. At negotiations the&#13;
Govemment furnished a statement establishing that full authority for procurement of goods and&#13;
services required for community microprojects is vested in the districts. These would include&#13;
shopping procedures, local competitive bidding procedures as appropriate and/or direct&#13;
contracting where the first two methods are not feasible. Each microproject contract will be&#13;
supported by a technical proposal, basic financial analysis and budget approved by the District&#13;
Steering Group, summarized in a sanction letter to be signed by the DPC. DSU would have&#13;
the responsibility to supervise implementation and report progress to the DSG.&#13;
(d)    Technical Assistance and Training The project would finance four major and several minor&#13;
studies, meet the cost of consultants and fund training of staff and communities. Consultants&#13;
will be hired following procedures set forth in the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by the&#13;
World Bank as Executing Agency". All terms of reference for consultants, consultant contracts&#13;
for firms above US$100,000 and for individuals above US$50,000 and training proposals will&#13;
be subject to IDA prior review. All contracts, regardless of contract value, for consultants to be&#13;
appointed under NSU, and DSUs, will be subject to prior review by IDA. Where applicable,&#13;
consultant contracts would include a training component.&#13;

3.12   Procurement Review  Table 3 shows procurement procedures to be adopted for the project.&#13;
All bidding packages (for civil works and goods) estimated to cost US$100,000 or more would be&#13;
subject to IDA prior review. Other contracts will be subject to post reviews in accordance with the&#13;
provisions of Appendix I of the Bank's procurement Guidelines. The prior review process would cover&#13;
about 35 percent of the works, 70 percent of goods and 80 percent of consultant services and training.&#13;
Overall IDA prior review would cover about 57 percent of IDA-financed contracts. The level of IDA&#13;
prior review is lower than the expected 80 percent because of the nature of the project, i.e., small&#13;
community projects and decentralizing procurement to the districts.  However, it would be&#13;
compensated in several ways: (i) the annual financial audit will look at procurement matters; (ii) the&#13;
post-two year evaluation of CD component will include comprehensive review of the procurement&#13;
implementing process; and (iii) during IDA supervision, random reviews would be conducted of&#13;
procurement packages, including field visits and reviews of documentation of microprojects and other&#13;
procurement packages. A list of important contracts for works, goods and consultants and their&#13;
procurement schedule relative to the implementation plan is provided in the PIP.&#13;
E. IDA CREDIT ALLOCATION AND DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.13   The Project Disbursement Plan is shown in Table 4. The fully implemented credit is expected&#13;
to be disbursed over six years as shown in the disbursement schedule (Annex 8). The countrywide&#13;
profile is six and a half years. The credit closing date is June 30, 2001.&#13;

exceptions, for which certified Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) would be used: (i) contracts less&#13;
than US$100,000 equivalent; (ii) all local training, and (iii) operating costs. SOE thresholds for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

consultants would be US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals. SOEs would be certified&#13;
by the Finance Officer in the NSU and the External Resources Division (ERD) of the Ministry of&#13;
Finance, who would confirm that these are in agreement with the books of account. These would be&#13;
subject to review by IDA supervision missions and interim and annual audits (para 4.9).&#13;
3.15  In order to facilitate the availability of funds for the project when needed, a Special Account&#13;
will be established in a commercial bank and operated and maintained on terms satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
An initial deposit of US$1 million will be deposited by IDA into the Special Account. The Special&#13;
Account will be replenished on the basis of satisfactory documentary evidence, to be provided to IDA,&#13;
of eligible payments made from the account for goods and services required for the project. No limit&#13;
will be set on the size of the payments to be made from the Special Account other than that imposed by&#13;
the balance remaining in the account.&#13;
3.16   Flow of Funds to Districts (a) The Government will continue for ALRFMP the existing&#13;
budgeting and funding arrangement established for the EDRP for transferring project funds to the&#13;
districts for meeting the costs of district-based project activities. This arrangement comprises a single&#13;
line budget under the OP, a single Authority to Incur Expenditure (AIE) issued in favor of the DPC in&#13;
each project district, and especially enhanced district cash floats for each project district to fully meet&#13;
the cash requirements of project expenditures. Funds would be allocated to line ministries and other&#13;
collaborating agencies for activities at the district level based on the process of identification of&#13;
community priorities, which will result in district annual work plans. At negotiations the Government&#13;
confirmed that these arrangements will be applied to ALRMP and will not be altered without mutual&#13;
agreement during project implementation. (b) The Government and IDA shall monitor and review the&#13;
operation and effectiveness of the district payment mechanism from time to time. If the joint review&#13;
concludes that the payment mechanism is not effective, the Government shall, not later than three&#13;
months after being notified by IDA, introduce and implement such modification of the mechanism or of&#13;
the applicable administrative and financial rules and procedures as may have been agreed upon with&#13;
IDA.&#13;
3.17  Government has also given an assurance to make appropriate provisions of funds in the&#13;
budget for year one of the project in terms of the agreed Annual Work Plan and to ensure that&#13;
these funds are available for meeting project expenditures as soon as the project becomes&#13;
effective.&#13;
&#13;

4.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.1    Building on the experience acquired under the previous EDRP, the ALRMP will (a)&#13;
provide a system and policy for effective drought management; and (b) strengthen the&#13;
communities' capacity to deal with further droughts. In order to assure long term sustainability,&#13;
any action or intervention will be designed to be as cost effective as possible, to be community&#13;
based, and to be implemented through the relevant line ministries and collaborating agencies.&#13;
To be successful however, the line ministries will have to adapt their way of operating to the&#13;
particularities of the Arid Lands. They will also need strong support and guidance from the&#13;
National Support Unit and the District Coordinators in the Office of the President to meet this&#13;
challenge. The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock Development and Marketing, the Ministry of&#13;
Land Reclamation, Regional and Water Development, and the Ministry of Health have&#13;
continued, during project preparation, to refine a broad outline of the adaptations to be made to&#13;
their respective ways of operating in order to become more effective in their response to the&#13;
communities' needs and demands During the respective district launching workshops, the staff&#13;
of each line department will examine how the different frameworks for action can be best&#13;
implemented, taking the local conditions into account. Yearly follow-up workshops will be&#13;
organized in each district to critically examine and improve the effectiveness of the current way&#13;
of operating.&#13;
4.2   It is ALRMP's role to assist the line ministries in the adaptation of their mode of&#13;
operation to the specific requirements and conditions of the communities in the arid lands.&#13;
To assure full ownership of the communities, in any activity involving physical inputs, the&#13;
principal of joint action will be upheld with the communities contributing at least a&#13;
minimum of 30% of the total cost. In addition to the support with regard to organizational&#13;
and technical matters, ALRMP can provide equipment to the line ministries to implement&#13;
their work plans. However, ALRMP is the donor of last resort: only after having&#13;
exhausted the own regular budget and any other possible source of financing (including&#13;
NGOs), the line ministries can request incremental financing from ALRMP. The line&#13;
ministries will be expected to maintain or if necessary increase their funding levels to adapt&#13;
their service delivery to meet the conditions of the arid lands and to manage the drought&#13;
cycle.&#13;
4.3   The organization and management under ALRMP is as follows:&#13;
4.4    National level&#13;
(a)    The National Relief and Rehabilitation Coordination Committee (NRRCC)&#13;
will define and enforce the drought management policy of the Government. It is&#13;
constituted by the Permanent Secretaries of the MOALDM, MOH, MILRRWD,&#13;
MOPW and MOE under the chairmanship of the Permanent Secretary for Relief&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
and Rehabilitation of the Office of the President. The NRRCC meets at least twice&#13;
every year, or whenever the need may arise to provide the policy guidance to the&#13;
program.&#13;
(b)   The Project Steering Committee (PSC) will monitor the implementation of the&#13;
program on a continuous basis and will be constituted by directors (or their senior&#13;
aides) of the respective line ministries. The PSC will be chaired by the Director of&#13;
Programs from the Office of the President. During the working sessions, the PSC&#13;
members will verify to what extent each of the line ministries' work programs in&#13;
the ALs is in line with the declared objectives. The PSC will carry out quarterly&#13;
field supervision missions to supervise and encourage the line ministries' staff at&#13;
the district level, and to propose any corrective action where and when needed.&#13;
The National Project Coordinator is the secretary of the PSC.&#13;
(c)    The National Support Unit (NSU) is responsible for (a) the coordination of the&#13;
ALRMP; (b) the monthly publication of the national drought status report; (c) the&#13;
support and supervision to the training initiatives at the district level; and (d)&#13;
development and sustainance of drought contingency plans and response&#13;
mechanisms. The NSU is headed by the National Project Coordinator, who&#13;
reports to the Director of Programs in the Office of the President, and comprises&#13;
a drought monitoring officer, a training officer, and a support unit (accounts&#13;
officer, supplies officer, drivers, secretaries, and messenger). The professional&#13;
staff in the NSU will spend most of their time in the field to assist the&#13;
implementation of the program in the ALs districts. They will give guidance to&#13;
the District Program Coordinators, and will support the respective line&#13;
departments with the field implementation of their activities. In particular, the&#13;
NSU members will assure the proper follow-up for the recommendations made by&#13;
the PSC.&#13;
4.5    District level:&#13;
(a)    The District Steering Group (DSG) will comprise the heads of departments of&#13;
each of the line ministries concerned (MOALDM, MOH, MLRRWD, MOPW and&#13;
MOE), the District Program Coordinator, as well as local NGOs and at least two&#13;
community leaders. The DSG will be chaired by the District Commissioner. The&#13;
Program Coordinator is in charge of the secretariat. The DSG is responsible for:&#13;
(a) supervising the planning of activities in each of the line departments so that&#13;
work programs filly respond to communities' needs and demands; (b) monitoring&#13;
the effectiveness of implementation; (c) development of a district drought&#13;
contigency plan; (d) reviewing the monthly district drought bulletin issued by the&#13;
Department for Relief and Rehabilitation; and (e) decide on steps to be taken for&#13;
appropriate response whithin the framework of the district drought contingency&#13;
plan. The DSG will meet at least once per month.&#13;
(b)   The District Program Coordinator (DPC) reports to the NPC in the Office of&#13;
the President and at the district level to the District Commissioner. The DPC has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
two major responsibilities: (a) to provide critical feed back regarding the efficiency&#13;
of the respective line ministries' field operations, as well as guidance and support&#13;
needed to plan and implement their program; and (b) the monthly publication of&#13;
the drought bulletin. It is considered to be of crucial importance for the success of&#13;
the program that the line ministries would have strong and continuous external&#13;
support from the DPC. In each district, the DPC will be assisted by a support unit&#13;
comprising a supplies assistant, an accounts assistant, and three support staff&#13;
(driver, secretary, messenger). The DPC and the unit will be equipped with a 4x4&#13;
vehicle and two motorcycles.&#13;
(c)    The Drought Monitoring System will, as mentioned above, be part of the&#13;
responsibility of the DPC. In each district a Drought Monitoring Officer will be&#13;
identified, to the extent possible among the existing staff of the line ministries.&#13;
He/she will report to the DPC and be responsible for the supervision of data&#13;
collection, the analysis of the data, and the publication of the drought bulletin.&#13;
For purposes of data collection in the field, the program will train about 50&#13;
monitors per district. These monitors are part of the communities, and work on a&#13;
temporary basis (one week per month). Since they collect data in the immediate&#13;
vicinity of their locality, they do not need any particular means of transportation.&#13;
(d)   The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock Development and Marketing&#13;
(MOALDM) will, with regard to animal health and livestock production, provide&#13;
support to about 100 Community Animal Health Workers (CAHWs) per district.&#13;
As mentioned above, these CAHWs will: (a) sell basic animal drugs in their&#13;
community; (b) act as the first line animal health care, and; (c) serve as "contact&#13;
pastoralists" for the dissemination of technical messages related to the&#13;
improvement of the herders' capacity to manage their livestock. One front line&#13;
staff (about ten per district, based at the divisional level) can provide support to&#13;
about ten CAHWs. In general, the front line staff will be equipped with&#13;
motorcycles. However, it still needs to be specified during project implementation&#13;
which means of transportation would be most suitable in those cases where&#13;
motorcycles are not a practical solution. The front line staff will receive quarterly&#13;
visits from the District Veterinary Officer and the District Livestock Production&#13;
Officer, and will participate in three monthly training sessions. During project&#13;
implementation, two major issues still need to be clarified: how to organize&#13;
effective linkages with research, and how to improve and support the organization&#13;
of vaccination campaigns so as to increase coverage and to make them more&#13;
efficient and cost effective.&#13;
(e)    To improve support to crop production in the ALs, the MOALDM will improve&#13;
the organization of the existing front line staff according to two scenarios: (a) the&#13;
front line extension worker lives near the agricultural area (irrigation scheme or&#13;
rain fed farming), providing support to the farmers within walking distance not&#13;
needing any specific means of transportation, and (b) the front line staff (FLS)&#13;
provide support to a number of farmers in more than one location, therefore&#13;
needing a motorcycle to visit the farmers. All FLS will meet with farmers on a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
fortnightly basis. The ratio of number of farm families per front line staff will vary&#13;
from district to district. However, given the distances to be traveled between&#13;
different areas where agriculture is being practiced, the ratio of FLS per farm&#13;
families should not exceed one per 200. The actual number of existing FLS also&#13;
varies considerably (depending on the importance of agriculture in the district) but&#13;
never exceeds about 40. At least once per month, FLS will benefit from&#13;
supervision. There will be one supervisor per five to eight FLS. At the district&#13;
level, a team of SMS will be responsible for the training of FLS. Once per month,&#13;
the District Agricultural Officer (DAO) will gather all FLS in a specific location&#13;
for this purpose.&#13;
(f)    The Ministry of Land Reclamation, Regional and Water Development&#13;
(MLRRWD) will have in each district a team to install new water points. This&#13;
team will comprise three types of units: a drilling unit for boreholes, a pump&#13;
installation unit, and a dam construction unit. These units will be equipped with a&#13;
lorry for transportation of materials. The support to communities' management&#13;
and operation of the water units is assured through monthly visits from the&#13;
divisional officers (about three per district). In most cases, these officers will be&#13;
equipped with a motorcycle. In addition, a maintenance unit is on call at the&#13;
district level to react to demands from the respective users associations to&#13;
intervene for repairs surpassing the community water workers' capacity. This&#13;
maintenance unit comprises an electrician, a plant mechanic, and a plumber and&#13;
will be provided with a 4x4 vehicle equipped equipped with the necessary tools.&#13;
Supervision is assured by the district training officer and the district water&#13;
engineer. The district training officer will visit each of the divisional water officers&#13;
at least once per month. These visits are also instrumental to upgrade the front&#13;
line staffs' skills. The district water engineer visits each of the communities at least&#13;
once every quarter to check on the efficiency of the services delivered by his staff.&#13;
(g)    At the district level, the Ministry of Health will have a District Nomadic Primary&#13;
Health Core Team of about four members. The core team is under the leadership&#13;
of the district nomadic primary health care coordinator who is responsible for the&#13;
supervision of field activities and the training of staff in the health centers and&#13;
dispensaries. At the division level there is a health center which is headed by a&#13;
clinical officer. The officer supervises, among other things, the divisional nomadic&#13;
primary health care team constituted of the public health officer, and a community&#13;
nurse. The members of this team are trained during a one week course as trainers&#13;
of trainers (TOTs) and participate in continuing education courses about once&#13;
every three months. They are responsible for the training and supervision of the&#13;
Village Health Committee members, the Community Health Workers (CHWs), and&#13;
the Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs), and will, to achieve this, visit settlements&#13;
without any health facilities once every month on a specified day. The team will be&#13;
equipped with two motorcycles. To assure treatment of minor ailments in&#13;
settlements and in nomadic communities, a district based team of five officers visit&#13;
settlements without health facilities at a well defined time and place (so that&#13;
nomadic people will know where and when they can meet with this team for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
consultation). The team will have a van equipped to provide primary curative and&#13;
preventive health care. In optimal conditions, the team can visit each settlement&#13;
once every two months.&#13;
4.6   Project Phasing  The Drought Management and Marketing and Infrastructure&#13;
components of the project would be implemented over a six-year implementation period. The&#13;
Community Development component would initially be implemented in only four districts over&#13;
a four-year period. However, if the findings of the evaluation at mid-term are positive,&#13;
decisions would be made to continue the component for the full project term of six years in&#13;
these districts and to extend its coverage to the remaining districts. A sum of US$1.3 million&#13;
has been included in the project costs for this purpose. Groundwork for project start-up will&#13;
commence in the zero year (starting in early 1995) and will be mainly devoted to establishing&#13;
both the institutional and organizational infrastructure as well as advance action for the&#13;
procurement of vehicles and equipment. The demonstrated benefits accruing from project&#13;
initiatives would encourage the conflict resolution process and form the basis for expanding&#13;
project activities to the relatively insecure areas. It was agreed during negotiations that a&#13;
comprehensive mid-term review would be carried out at the end of year three between&#13;
September 30, 1998 and December 31, 1998, and lessons learned incorporated. A detailed list&#13;
of topics to be covered at the mid-term review has been included in the PIP. Project activities&#13;
in the zero year will be funded through a PPF and partly through the components of EDRP&#13;
which have been aligned during its mid-term review to eventually dovetail into ALRMP.&#13;
B. CONSULTANCIES AND STUDIES&#13;
4.7   The project provides for about 48 person-months of consultancies for drought&#13;
management and community development, for guiding and advising on preparation of the&#13;
national and district drought manuals and contingency plans and the establishment of the&#13;
drought monitoring system (para 3.4) and for advising on operational issues related to&#13;
community development activities. The project will also finance studies in tenurial and grazing&#13;
rights of pastoralists, resource management in ALs and on marketing.&#13;
C. PROJECT MONITORING AN" EVALUATION&#13;
4.8   Baseline studies will be carried out under EDRP and under the project preparation&#13;
facility, which will form the basis for project evaluation.  Assurance was obtained at&#13;
negotiations that the design and formats of the baseline studies will be finalized in consultation&#13;
with IDA. The timeframe for conducting the surveys was agreed at negotiations. Monitorable&#13;
indicators have been developed during appraisal and are included in the PIP. A list of key&#13;
indicators finalized during negotiations is attached (Annex 10). During implementation, an&#13;
annual review workshops will be held, rotationally in each district, as a sharing, best-practice&#13;
learning event.  All implementers in the field, including govemment ministries, NGO&#13;
functionaries, representatives of participating communities, and staff of DSU/NSU will be the&#13;
participants.  The workshop will review implementation of the previous year, identify&#13;
constraints and issues, select best practices and set goals and Implementation methodology for&#13;
the next year. An annual evaluation of the CD component will be carried out. The review at the&#13;
end of year two will be comprehensive so that lessons are applied in the implementation of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23 -&#13;
component in the remaining period. An impact evaluation of the project will be carried out at&#13;
rmid-term and in the terminal year of the project. The impact study will particularly focus on&#13;
the benefits of improved market linkages, i.e., improved livestock take-off and farm gate&#13;
prices, the reduction in drought inflicted losses, and increase in the off-farm income generation&#13;
capacity. At negotiations Government assurance was obtained for conducting the impact&#13;
evaluation study as proposed above. Agreement was also reached on the design and important&#13;
details of the study.&#13;
D. AUDITING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS&#13;
4.9   The overall financial management, accounting and budgeting of the project will be the&#13;
responsibility of NSU, which will co-ordinate all financial transactions including disbursement&#13;
requests generated by DSUs. NSU and the districts would maintain accounts and records for&#13;
project activities, including for SOEs and the Special Account, as relevant (paras. 3.13 and&#13;
3.14) in accordance with sound accounting practices satisfactory to IDA. Assurances were&#13;
received during negotiations that the Government would (i) have the records and the accounts&#13;
of the project, including those for the Special Account and SOEs, audited for each fiscal year&#13;
by the Controller and Auditor General (CAG) or private auditors appointed by the CAG and&#13;
acceptable to IDA; (ii) submit the audit reports to IDA within six months of the close of every&#13;
fiscal year; (iii) ensure that the audit would comprise the auditor's report on the project&#13;
accounts comprising balance sheet (to show fixed and current assets), operating expenditure&#13;
statement and statement showing sources and application of funds, the Special Account and the&#13;
SOEs. The audit report will also include a statement on the adequacy of the accounting system&#13;
and intemal controls. At negotiation the GOK provided assurances that (i) project audit reports&#13;
will be fumished to IDA in formats generally and/or specifically agreed between GOK and&#13;
IDA; and (ii) the project's financial management and accounting system will be in place and&#13;
operating before effectiveness.&#13;
4.10   Semi-annual reports, in agreed formats included in the PIP, on the progress of project&#13;
components would be prepared and submitted to IDA by the NSU. A mid-term review of the&#13;
progress and impact of the project interventions will be undertaken by OP and IDA not later&#13;
than September 30, 1998. To facilitate this review, the NSU will prepare a project mid-term&#13;
status report and furnish to IDA at least three months before the scheduled date for the mid-&#13;
term review. The review would form the basis for the Government/IDA to assess what&#13;
corrective action may need to be taken and whether any reallocation between components is&#13;
required. Six months before the project closing date, the Borrower will prepare and make&#13;
available to IDA its own implementation evaluation report on the project's execution and initial&#13;
costs and benefits, IDA's and the Government's performance of their respective obligations&#13;
under the Credit Agreement, and the extent to which the purposes of the credit were achieved.&#13;
The formats for the evaluation report have been described in the PIP.&#13;
E. SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
4.11   The project would be supervised more intensively by GOK and IDA in the first two&#13;
years to guide community-oriented implementation and cooperation between various&#13;
development actors in an environment where process is as important as the achievement of&#13;
basic objectives. IDA supervision would require experts in institutions and community&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
development, drought management and livestock marketing and procurement at least twice in&#13;
each of the first two years and once armually in the remaining period.  In addition, a&#13;
disbursement specialist would join at least three missions in the first two years and later at the&#13;
time of the mid-term review. A roads engineer will be engaged in a few missions to review the&#13;
spot improvement program  for repairing critical district roads.  The procurement and&#13;
disbursement specialists participating in the missions will also provide training and orientation&#13;
to the field staff. The first three missions will particularly focus on recruitment and staffing of&#13;
positions in the district and national project support units, training, establishment and smooth&#13;
operation of cooperation procedures, successful contracting for critical goods and consultancies&#13;
for studies, and intensive on-the ground review  of the community microprojects and&#13;
community participation in project implementation. Review of the Government's arrangements&#13;
for the flow of funds would also receive serious attention, as would the adequacy of budgeting&#13;
and timely fund availability to the districts for meeting project expenditures. A detailed&#13;
supervision plan indicating approximate mission schedules, key activities to be reviewed, items&#13;
of special focus, expected skills and estimated staff inputs is given in Annex 11.&#13;

5.   PROJECT JUSTIFICATION, RISKS AND SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
A. JUSTIFICATION&#13;
5.1   The over-arching objective of the project is to reduce widespread poverty and&#13;
enhance food security in the Arid Lands (about 75% of Kenya's land area is classified as&#13;
arid or semi-arid, with the ALs comprising 60% of the total land area of Kenya). Almost the&#13;
entire population of around I million people in the ALs are below the poverty line as defined in&#13;
the recently finalized Poverty Assessment report (discussed in paras. 2.8-2.12). The&#13;
predominantly pastoralist populations in the arid districts, are in fact counted among the poorest&#13;
and the most disadvantaged sections of society in the country. Social welfare indicators show&#13;
that in terms of access to communications, public health, nutrition and education services, they&#13;
receive a fraction of the services available to the rest of the Kenyan population. The project&#13;
specifically supports the core objective of reducing poverty and strengthening the basis for&#13;
equitable and environmentally sustainable economic development as defined in the CAS. The&#13;
project is targeted to reach a highly disadvantaged group of communities living under harsh&#13;
economic and agro-ecological conditions, and seeks to improve the living conditions of AL&#13;
populations through: (i) enhancing resilience to droughts; (ii) increasing incomes through&#13;
strengthening linkages with the rest of the economy; (iii) addressing basic needs of the&#13;
communities, and especially of women and children; and (iv) the conservation of the natural&#13;
resource base of the ALs.&#13;
5.2    Rising population pressures in the semi -arid lands have also increased the pressure on&#13;
the AL resource base (see paras. 2.9-2.10). Consequently the traditional coping mechanisms of&#13;
the AL populations are no longer adequate to allow them to recover from droughts. As a result,&#13;
their dependence on primarily donor financed relief programs has grown over the years and in&#13;
some parts of the ALs it has become a way of life. This is clearly not sustainable. The main aim&#13;
of the drought management component of the project would be to enhance the AL population's&#13;
resilience to drought, and by formulating a detailed set of arrangements for drought warning,&#13;
mitigation and recovery, aimed at reducing drought inflicted losses (see para. 3.4 &amp; Annex 3),&#13;
and reduce the need for repetitive emergency interventions. In particular, the devastating&#13;
impact of the recurrent droughts will be contained through a comprehensive set of actions,&#13;
such as, the institutionalization of the drought management mechanism at the national, district&#13;
and local levels; strengthening of the national drought early warning system; improvement of&#13;
stockroutes (holding grounds, water points, etc.) for emergency livestock evacuation;&#13;
establishment and maintenance of drought grazing reserves; emergency veterinary campaigns,&#13;
operation of drought related CFW/FFW projects; and, support for food aid activities. In&#13;
addition, the project would strengthen and support local initiatives to better manage range&#13;
lands, critical grazing reserves and other easily degradable environments in ALs and thereby&#13;
help strengthen the traditional coping mechanisms of the AL communities as well (paras. 3.8;&#13;
5.14 and Annex 9). The project will also finance studies aimed at developing a policy and legal&#13;
framework to address important concerns in areas such as, implications of diminishing dry&#13;
season grazing regions; implications of increased sedentarization on stock routes and&#13;
emergency grazing reserves; current regulations/practices on grazing rights and introduction of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
appropriate reforms; and, testing desert resource management technologies e.g. sustainable&#13;
water development, fodder development, grazing land management, pastoral income&#13;
diversification.&#13;
5.3   The main economic asset of the ALs is livestock (Table 5.1). However, as a result of&#13;
poor linkages with the rest of the economy (due mainly to inadequate infrastructure), the AL&#13;
communities have been unable to realize the financial benefits from this important resource&#13;
(para 2.12). The project aims to improve the linkages of the ALs with the rest of the economy.&#13;
Specifically the project would help facilitate the further integration of these communities by&#13;
providing marketing outlets for livestock and livestock products (para. 3.5; Annex 4). In&#13;
operationalizing key stockroutes, the component will finance the rehabilitation of related&#13;
infrastructure, such as, holding grounds, water points, marketing centers; the formation of user-&#13;
groups for the identification of marketing obstacles and related solutions, as well as pertinent&#13;
studies will also be supported under the project.&#13;

5.4   The ALs have been a target of many development interventions as described in Annex&#13;
2. The main lesson learned from the successful initiatives is that, sustainable development&#13;
would not have been possible without strong community involvement in decision making and&#13;
implementation. This lesson has been the corner-stone in designing the CD component under&#13;
the project. The CD component of the project would enable communities to plan and&#13;
implement micro-projects that respond to their own priorities, building sustainability into the&#13;
development initiatives (para. 3.6; Annex 5). These microprojects would help meet basic social&#13;
needs, in particular of women and children, and also promote off/on-farm income generating&#13;
activities. ALRMP's precursor, and the only World Bank project in the area -- EDRP, is&#13;
having an impact in improving the management of livestock resources, animal health, drought,&#13;
water resources and the environment/natural resource base, as well as, strengthening local&#13;
capacities in the four arid districts where it is being implemented.&#13;
B. PROJECT IMPACT&#13;
5.5   Poverty Reduction. Designed to be implemented following a bottom-up, community-&#13;
based, demand-driven development approach, ALRMP's preparation entailed joint visits,&#13;
systematic client consultations, and "on-location" planning exercises with AL pastoralist&#13;
communities. Hence, the project's participatory planning approach, the identification of priority&#13;
actionable areas for ameliorating the quality of life of the AL communities and the direct&#13;
delivery of funds into communities, are all targeted towards reducing poverty in the ALs. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
poverty reduction strategy under the project, is aimed at galvanizing broad-based econormic&#13;
growth in the region through improved management of the AL poor's most abundant resources&#13;
- livestock and labor, in conjunction with the improved management of the natural resources of&#13;
the ALs (para. 5.14). The Poverty Assessment report indicates that in 1992 the poverty line in&#13;
rural areas stood at Ksh. 485 per adult equivalent unit (a.e.u) per month or about US $ 10 per&#13;
a.e.u., per month. The project would significantly increase the income of the largely pastoralist&#13;
population through: (i) reduction in mortality rates of the livestock resources, particularly, in&#13;
periods of drought; (ii) improvements in animal health leading to more rapid herd growth&#13;
(improved fertility, reduced mortality); (iii) increased volume of sales due to improvements in&#13;
herd growth rates (ensuring larger surplus for the markets), as well as, higher off-take rates due&#13;
to improved commercial linkages with the rest of the economy; and (iv) increases in farm-gate&#13;
prices due to both the improvements in quality of livestock offered by the AL pastoralists, and&#13;
the reduction in transportation and other transaction costs of middle-men/traders, a portion of&#13;
which would be passed on to the farm-level. The other mutually reinforcing element of the&#13;
project's poverty reduction strategy relates to the development of off-farm income generation&#13;
activities, which while helping push up the standard of living in the area, would both reduce the&#13;
dependence on /depletion of ALs' natural resources, and help stabilize incomes in the drought&#13;
years.&#13;
5.6    Drought Management. The main benefit of the project's drought management&#13;
activities would be the reduction of livestock losses due to the droughts which regularly&#13;
devastate these areas. Livestock losses can be very severe. In the 1984 drought, approximately&#13;
33 percent of cattle, 25 percent of small ruminants (sheep/goats) and 13 percent of camels&#13;
perished; in 1992 nearly 46 percent of cattle, 31 percent of sheep and 21 percent of camels&#13;
were lost in the six severely affected arid districts. It is very modestly estimated that the project&#13;
would help reduce livestock losses by about one-quarter of their present drought mortality rates&#13;
(Table 5.2). The resultant benefits are estimated at about US$ 9 million (at current prices) in a&#13;
severe drought and about US$ 6 million in a less severe drought. If however, the project results&#13;
in a reduction of the drought mortality rates by one-third, the gross benefits would be&#13;
equivalent to some US $ 12 million in a severe drought and US$ 8 million in a less severe&#13;
drought. If on the basis of past experience it is assumed that a severe drought is experienced&#13;
every 10 years and a less severe drought every five, then over a 20 year period potential&#13;
benefits from improved drought management are expected to be considerable.&#13;

5.7   In addition, improved drought management would also lead to less deterioration of the&#13;
general condition of the animals which should result in better prices when they are sold.&#13;
Keeping more animals alive during a drought will have substantial nutritional benefits to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

population and reduce the need for costly food imports or aid and help minimize disruption of&#13;
the pastoralist economy.&#13;
5.8    Market Linkages, Animal Health &amp; Farmgate Prices. The project would also lead&#13;
to improved market linkages. Over the last ten years, on average, the livestock offtake rates for&#13;
the ALs have been as follows: 7 percent of the cattle, 8 percent of the goats/sheep and about&#13;
1.5 percent of the camels from the arid lands are marketed outside the region (Table 5.3). The&#13;
project aims to increase the low average annual off-take rates of AL livestock units over time&#13;
by strengthening the marketing links with the rest of the economy. A robust domestic/export&#13;
market for livestock products exists in Kenya, hence, the additional output would be readily&#13;
absorbed. While the considerable potential for improving the current AL offiake rates may&#13;
well be realized (under ALRMIP), such that the numbers of cattle marketed increases to 11&#13;
percent and small ruminants to 25 percent annually, for the purposes of assessing incremental&#13;
project benefits, it is frugally estimated that at full development the project would increase&#13;
annual sales of cattle and small ruminants by 20 percent each over current rates -- to about 8.4&#13;
and 10 percent, respectively, and that of camels by just 10 percent p.a. (to some 2 percent).&#13;
Table 5.3: Livestock Offtake Rates&#13;
3    With-out Project           With Project&#13;
Offtake Rates           Offtake Rates&#13;
sheep/goats               8.0%                    9.6%&#13;
camels                 1.7%                     1.9%&#13;
cattle                  0 7%0%                 8.4%&#13;
5.9   It is also envisaged that the improvements in the quality of the livestock units being&#13;
sold (due to increased availability of water, fodder and animal health services), and reduction in&#13;
transportation and other trading costs, would directly translate into improvements in farm-gate&#13;
prices under the project (Table 5.4). Again, the premiums for quality and the general reduction&#13;
in transaction costs is conservatively estimated to yield a nominal 10 percent improvement in&#13;
prices, over their current levels. The farmgate prices have been calculated by averaging the&#13;
prices prevailing in project districts over the last two years; the prices prevailing during the&#13;
severe drought of year of 1991/92 were taken as the benchmark for the reduced price levels&#13;
during droughts. Given the substantial drought mitigation/management efforts under the&#13;
project, it is envisaged that the slaughter rates of cattle, particularly during the less severe&#13;
droughts will be reduced, as the effective activation of the emergency relief apparatus would&#13;
augment the staying power of the pastoralists and their herds. It is hence assumed that the&#13;
prices during the less severe droughts will stabilize at around fifty percent of the normal&#13;
farmgate price levels. Overall, the value of the incremental sales (at the improved prices) under&#13;
the project (during a normal year) is hence estimated at some US$5 million annually (in current&#13;
prices). Due to paucity of reliable data, no serious effort was made to evaluate the project&#13;
benefits deriving from increased meat, milk, skin and wool production. Nevertheless, it should&#13;
be noted that in addition to the meat, milk forms a large part of the pastoralist diet and&#13;
provides an important proportion of the necessary calories and proteins. Much of the&#13;
incremental milk produced would be consumed locally. In addition, the improved incomes of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
the arid lands populations would have a multiplier effect through increased trade with the rest&#13;
of the economy.&#13;

5.10   . Community Development The CD component of the project would also lead to&#13;
substantial monetary and non-monetary benefits to the beneficiaries. A key focus of CD&#13;
component is to promote income-generating activities, particularly through support for off-&#13;
farm microenterprises. This support would take the form of training, limited technical&#13;
assistance, and seed capital. Although a precise assessment of the overall economic or financial&#13;
costs and benefits arising from the component is not feasible, the project is designed to draw&#13;
upon the least cost options for undertaking the proposed initiatives in the project area. It is&#13;
anticipated that about 15 percent of the AL population will benefit from the support under the&#13;
project for setting up on/off-farm microenterprises, which is envisaged to improve their gross&#13;
incomes by a modest 10 percent, it is expected that at full development, some US$ 1.5 rmillion&#13;
(in current prices), will be added annually to the gross earnings of the AL population. An&#13;
assessment (on the basis of the experiences under EDRP and other relevant development&#13;
initiatives in the ALs), of the gross annual benefits accruing from representative models of&#13;
selected (potential) microprojects with moderate investments in the areas of community&#13;
educational facilities and water schemes, indicates that over a twenty year period, the total&#13;
quantifiable benefits from these initiatives would significantly exceed the microproject&#13;
investment costs. Assuming improved employment opportunities for only about 5 percent of&#13;
the young adults receiving primary education (from a total of some 1500 students per year),&#13;
either through the application of the "under the tree" nomadic education models or through the&#13;
improvement of the more formal educational facilities, supported under the project (three&#13;
educational facilities per district were assumed), on the basis of very conservative estimates&#13;
(i.e., only a fifth of their income is attributed to their education), the total annual (incremental)&#13;
benefit from the gainful employment of these students amounts to about US$ 12,000 (in&#13;
current prices), starting in about PYI I (by PY20 the cumulative total incremental income will&#13;
amount to an estimated US$ 115,000). While US$ 12,000 is not an impressive amount per se,&#13;
this income represents a per capita incremental amount of about US$ 160 p.a. for the 5 percent&#13;
earning it, and helps push their earning levels over the poverty line. Likewise, financial analysis&#13;
relating to the provision of two borehole type water facilities for each of the project districts&#13;
indicates that, at current prices the total incremental income generated per year, from the&#13;
operation of these boreholes (for 300 days per year, at the charge of Ksh. 2 /livestock unit/day&#13;
for some 16,500 heads of livestock), a total annual income of US$ 216,000 may be expected&#13;
at full development.&#13;
5.11  In addition, the improved educational facilities and water resources will translate into&#13;
enhancing the quality of life and increasing the productivity of the local communities, as well as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
improving their income base/potential. Improvements in the general health of the local&#13;
population and their livestock herds due to increased access to good quality drinking water&#13;
would translate into direct economic benefits, and community water schemes would lead to&#13;
increased food production in home gardens (evidence of this is visible under EDRP) and&#13;
substantial savings in terms of labor by reducing the time it takes to fetch water or trekking&#13;
animals several kms away to water points. The project is designed to draw upon the least cost&#13;
options for undertaking the proposed initiatives in the project area. The representatives of the&#13;
key technical line ministries in the District Steering Group will evaluate the soundness of the&#13;
technological packages being adopted The locally based Collaborating Agencies as well as the&#13;
AL communities themselves, would be closely involved in the selection of altemative&#13;
approaches with regard to technological processes and resources to be employed in&#13;
implementing various activities under the project Furthermore, the lessons of experience and&#13;
"best practices" that have evolved under the past and ongoing development interventions in the&#13;
area, e.g., EDRP, the Kenya Livestock Development Project funded by the European Union&#13;
and the UNDP supported Pastoralist Integrated Development Project (Annex 2), will be&#13;
applied and replicated under ALRMP. The project would, wherever possible, seek to employ&#13;
locally available cost effective and hitherto tested technology packages and resources,&#13;
eliminating the need for costly imports or exogenous technologies involving high operating and&#13;
maintenance costs. Both the design and the implementation strategy adopted for ALRMP are&#13;
based on the tenets of low cost alternatives and project sustainability. All aspects of the project&#13;
should lead to an overall decrease in dependence on food aid.&#13;
5.12   Nutrition, Health &amp; other Social Service Interventions. On the basis of community&#13;
preferences, microprojects to address education, nutrition, health and reproductive issues, will&#13;
be undertaken. These micro-projects which would help meet basic social needs, in particular of&#13;
women and children, through support for activities in the areas of curative care, communicable&#13;
disease interventions, improved hygienic practices, safe motherhood, family planning, nutrition&#13;
education, immunization programs, are envisaged to lead to substantial monetary and non-&#13;
monetary benefits to the communities. The enhanced training of community health workers&#13;
and nomadic teachers would also lead to better nutritional and health levels and increased&#13;
literacy.&#13;
5.13   Community Empowerment &amp; Local Capacity Building. The project seeks to foster&#13;
genuine local ownership of the development process in Kenya through assigning a pivotal role&#13;
to the AL communities in making development decisions. Not only did the AL communities&#13;
play a crucial role in the design of the project, but they will continue to be heavily involved in&#13;
its implementation. AL communities (assisted by line ministries, NGOs and local self help&#13;
groups, as needed) will identify, plan, implement and participate the all development activities&#13;
financed under the project. Participation orientation workshops, community development, and&#13;
community members'/ leaders' training programs are an integral part of the project.&#13;
5.14   Environmental Impact The project is envisaged to have a beneficial environmental&#13;
impact by seeking to contain the deterioration of the fragile ecosystem and reducing the&#13;
incidence of desertification. The project will contribute significantly to improving the&#13;
management of fragile environments in the ALs by strengthening the ability of the pastoral&#13;
communities to plan and implement appropriate development initiatives, to control access to&#13;
critical grazing reserves, and to encourage their rehabilitation. It will help formulate a set of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
initiatives to protect the environment-friendly rights of the pastoral communities. It would also&#13;
build a greater awareness of environmental management issues and enhance awareness of bio-&#13;
diversity concems, among the participating communities, the Govemment and collaborating&#13;
agencies. In addition, improved management of the ALs would translate into direct economic&#13;
gains for the local populations by way of increased fodder and fuelwood supplies in the&#13;
medium term. The framework and guidelines for the proposed ALRMIP are based on the&#13;
NEAP which was completed with IDA assistance in June 1994. An independent environmental&#13;
analysis/ review of this category B project was conducted by consultants appointed by the&#13;
Govemment. The review has determined that no negative impacts are anticipated because the&#13;
project is designed to use community-based, low-cost, sustainable resource management&#13;
techniques. The review also makes a number of suggestions for best practices that would have&#13;
a positive impact on the environment and makes recommendations for implementing these&#13;
development initiatives, e.g., not to permit settlements in the drought grazing reserves, not to&#13;
make populations affected by drought develop dependency on aid. The report is summarized in&#13;
Annex 9.&#13;
5.15   National Programs &amp; Replicability. ALRMP is part of a larger National Drought&#13;
Management Programme, and after several years of relatively ineffectual donor coordination in&#13;
the ASALs, the Arid Lands Resource Management Project is providing the bases for effective&#13;
coordination between the Bank and other multi-lateral and bilateral donors (EU, Dutch, GTZ).&#13;
Not only does ALRMP fit in with Kenya's national strategy for drought management, but it is&#13;
also providing a model for delivery of services to some of the poorest communities in Kenya -&#13;
through community empowerment and participatory development. In particular, it is providing&#13;
a model for service delivery to communities in terms of animal health. The formation of user&#13;
associations to manage livestock revolving funds and water user associations should be&#13;
considered replicable models or pilots, and promise to fit into overall national strategies. The&#13;
project is providing leadership in these remote districts for service delivery which is&#13;
participatory and community based. The experiences from project implementation can be used&#13;
to modify and improve national animal health programs, particularly with a view to improved&#13;
delivery of services in other sparsely populated parts of Kenya.&#13;

C. ECONOMIC AND FiNANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
5.16   The main quantifiable as well as non-monetizeable benefits accruing from  the&#13;
implementation of the various project components have been described at some length in paras.&#13;
5.5 through 5.15 , above. Since a number of project benefits elude quantification, a rigorous&#13;
economic analysis for the project was not feasible. However, the basic cost! benefit analysis&#13;
undertaken indicates that, even with modest assumptions about the quantifiable project&#13;
benefits, the potential retums from ALRMP will be fairly substantial (Annex 12). In view of&#13;
the impact of the recent price reforms in Kenya, the key distortions in the foreign exchange&#13;
rate, interest rates, wage rates and product prices have been removed. Thus, economic prices&#13;
are expected to be very close to financial prices. A project life of 20 years is assumed for&#13;
purposes of benefit-cost streams assessment. Taxes and duties were excluded from the&#13;
economic analysis. Also, price contingencies were not reflected in project costs, since the&#13;
project benefits were evaluated in constant terms, over the project life.&#13;
5.17   The analysis assumes that the main benefits resulting from the project would stem&#13;
from: a reduction in livestock mortality rates; a modest price increment or premium for the&#13;
improved quality livestock (along with the impact of reduced transportation/ marketing costs);&#13;
and, increased annual average off-take rates due to improvements in market linkages. The main&#13;
quantifiable benefit from the CD component is expected to result from an improvement in the&#13;
incomes of about 15 percent of the AL populations who are expected to set up micro-&#13;
enterprises with support from the project. Project investment and recurrent costs related to&#13;
each of the three components, were netted out against the benefits streams. Project Support&#13;
Unit costs were also included in the analysis. Following project completion, recurrent costs&#13;
were assumed to continue at levels essential for sustaining an adequate flow of services related&#13;
to the activities initiated under the project. A one time replacement/ rehabilitation expenditure&#13;
related to drought management equipment/ infrastructure, and for the rehabilitation/&#13;
construction of roads and replacement of construction and repair equipment was also included&#13;
in the analysis.&#13;
5.18   Based on the foregoing, an ERR of 16.9 percent is calculated for the project. Results&#13;
from switching value analysis for an ERR of 10 percent which is the Opportunity Cost of&#13;
Capital (OCC) for Kenya, demonstrate that a significant change in benefits or costs, i.e. a 34&#13;
percent drop in total (quantifiable) benefits, or a large increase of 51 percent in costs would be&#13;
required in order to reduce the ERR to 10 percent. Sensitivity Analysis shows that if benefits&#13;
fall or costs increase by 25 percent, the ERR would fall to 12 percent and 13.1 percent,&#13;
respectively. Altemately, if benefits increase or costs fall by 25 percent, the ERR would rise to&#13;
21.3 percent and 22.6 percent, respectively. An enormous decline of 70 percent in total&#13;
benefits would be essential in order for the ERR to drop to zero percent. Conversely, an&#13;
exponential increase of 200 percent in total project costs would push the ERR to zero percent.&#13;
If all quantifiable benefits envisaged to accrue from the drought mitigation/ management&#13;
interventions under ALRMP are excluded from the total benefits stream, the project's ERR&#13;
would decline to 10.4 percent; if instead, the benefits from the marketing and infrastructure&#13;
improvements under the project are excluded, the ERR drops to 5.3 percent. The exclusion of&#13;
the CD benefits reduces the ERR to 14.4 percent. No independent lag analysis of the&#13;
project's benefits stream was undertaken, as the impact of droughts on the project's benefits&#13;
stream was built into the basic economic analysis model.&#13;

D. RISKS&#13;
5.19  There are three main risks. First, due to the inadequacy of implementation capacity&#13;
and lack of coordination at district and national levels, implementation through districts may not&#13;
work effectively. This will have an impact on achieving project benefits. Delayed and/or&#13;
inadequate implementation of the drought mitigation interventions will impact adversely on the&#13;
immediate well being of AL communities during a drought and will make recovery more&#13;
difficult. Poor implementation of the livestock marketing component will also reduce the&#13;
financial benefits to the AL populations and delay and/or prevent the economic links with the&#13;
rest of the economy being established. To mitigate this risk, the project aims to further adapt&#13;
the institutional arrangements and capacity at the district level with the strong coordination role&#13;
of the Office of the President which is currently in place under EDRP and generally&#13;
functioning adequately. A related issue is that enhanced livestock marketing may be delayed&#13;
due to social conflict. Efforts at conflict resolution are already being undertaken by district&#13;
administrations. Furthermore, project activities would be first launched in the secure areas and&#13;
non-governmental agencies currently involved in conflict resolution efforts would be involved&#13;
in the process.&#13;
5.20  Second, the project would require a strong team effort to facilitate the participatory&#13;
process; large geographical areas with poor means of communication would add to the risk. If&#13;
the team effort is inadequate, the community development package in particular will be&#13;
affected. However, the adaptation of government delivery systems to the arid lands conditions,&#13;
the involvement of non-government agencies with a history of successful experience in the&#13;
areas, a strong orientation and training program, and the proposed decentralized institutional&#13;
arrangements would help minimize this risk.  In addition, some of the proposed sub-&#13;
components will follow successful patterns established in PIDP, EDRP and development&#13;
initiatives supported by bilateral and non-governmental agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
5.21   Third, flow of funds has been the most intractable issue in Kenya and principally&#13;
responsible for unsatisfactory project performance. This would be addressed by a combination&#13;
of recent initiatives in several ongoing projects in Kenya such as providing the budget for the&#13;
project under one vote of the coordinating ministry and the district funding mechanism&#13;
currently in use under EDRP and the Second National Agricultural Extension Project (Credit&#13;
2199-KE).&#13;
E. SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
5.22   The project is sustainable from a fiscal perspective. The Govemment is expected to&#13;
contribute around US$ 2.0 million of the project costs over the 6 year implementation period,&#13;
which is feasible based on current budgetary allocations (the allocation for EDRP in 1995/96&#13;
was KShs. 540 million, equivalent to about US$ 12 million, and KShs. 630 million (US$ 14&#13;
million) in 1994/95). The Ministry of Finance has included ALRMFP in the 1995/96 financial&#13;
year budget through the provision of a PPF of KShs. 11.4 million or US$ 252,500. The design&#13;
and implementation strategy adopted for ALRMP would lend sustainability to project&#13;
investments. Drought management will become a long-term Govemment function and the&#13;
drought management units will be integrated into the regular Govemment institutional&#13;
structure. After the credit closes, the impact of drought management expenditures on the&#13;
Government budget would be approximately US$330,000 annually. The O&amp;M allocation for&#13;
EDRP in 1995/96 was K. Shs 32.6 million (around US $ 700,000). Communities would also&#13;
have an important role in operating drought early warning systems, as well as in mitigation and&#13;
recovery efforts. Livestock routes, holding grounds and market yards will be maintained by&#13;
the communities and local authorities with negligible demands on the Treasury. Under the&#13;
Community Development component the project would provide a one-time capital support to&#13;
the community selected micro-projects. These micro-projects will be operated and maintained&#13;
by the communities without any further cost to the project or later on to the Government other&#13;
than followup training. Sustainability, ensured by community responsibility and commitments&#13;
to operate and maintain assets, would be fundamental to the design of microprojects and also a&#13;
pre-condition for funding under the ALRMP.&#13;

Arid Lands Rescurce Management Project            -&#13;
-~'  Letter of Sectoral Polic-&#13;
B ag&lt;tgroud&#13;
The Kenyar. economy is ptedomi.-antly dependent on agricult=ar, -&#13;
which e=cloys about 80 percent of the labour force and contributes&#13;
more than a cuaar-er or GDP.  Eoweve-, very little high potential&#13;
acricultural land tis left in the courtry which is not already being&#13;
croc-ped or grazed, and about three-auarters of the country's land&#13;
area  is  classified as arid and  semi-arid.   Keavy poculation&#13;
pressures  in high potential areas  and  the scarct  of gocd&#13;
agricultural land has resulted in the spillover of subsoantial&#13;
r.umbers of peocle fror-high potential areas to these marginal&#13;
lands.  This has had two imoacts.  Firstly, it has placed heavy&#13;
pressures on ecosystems which have historically supported extensive&#13;
pastoral populations, and secondly, the low productivity and&#13;
potential  of  these areas  has  often  resulted in the further&#13;
impoverishment of new residents.  Consequently, these fragile drier&#13;
areas of the country are experiencing the adverse environmental&#13;
technologies and sedentarization.   Not surprisingly, almost the&#13;
entire population of the Arid Lands of about one million,: are&#13;
included amongst the poorest and most disadvantaged. sections of&#13;
society.   Thus, although the Arid Lands are well-endowedc with.&#13;
livestock resources, in the absence of reliable marketing.outletsr&#13;
the  full  benefit  of  this  resou-ce  accrues  neithe-. ta. the&#13;
pastoralists nor to the consumers iz. the rest of the country'.'.&#13;
The Government has had a well-articulated Arid ahdSem        -&#13;
arid Lands (ASAL) policy since 1979 when an offLcialdocument set&#13;
out the ASAL policy framework for the  .980s.  The mai= hbject:iVCe&#13;

were stated as resource conservation, exploitation of productive&#13;
(primarily livestock) potential, development of human resources and&#13;
integration of the ASAL into the national economy.  Substantial&#13;
emphasis is also placed on drought contingency planning in order to&#13;
strengthen  the  coning mechanisms  of  local  communities.   The&#13;
Government, in Sessional pacer No. 1 of 1994 on Recovery and&#13;
Sustainable Develcoment, has committed itself to the management of&#13;
droughts, sustainable resource base management, and improvement of&#13;
marketing and infrastructure. it also recognizes an obligation to&#13;
crovide the opportunity to all Kenyans to participate fully in the&#13;
economic development of the country.&#13;
The Arid lands Resource Management Project (ALRMP) has been&#13;
formulated  as a Joint and particioatory  exercise between the&#13;
Government and the Bank to address the key constraints to the&#13;
development of the Arid Lands.  Throughout this exercise there has&#13;
been a large measure of mutual agreement on various aspects of the&#13;
project including alproach, design, components and implementation&#13;
arrangements. The long-term development objective of ALRMP is to&#13;
reduce widesp-ead poverty and enhance food security in the Arid&#13;
Lands by st-rerthening and developing both the capacity of the&#13;
local population, and the economic opcortunities available to them;&#13;
supporting efforts aimed at increasing incomes via linkages with&#13;
the   rest   of   the   ecoromy;    and   creatirg   alternative&#13;
employment/ income -generating   oncortunities   for   the   local&#13;
copulation.  A short-term objective of the project is to improve&#13;
t:he living conditions of Arid Land pcculations throuch enhancing&#13;
resilierce to drouchts, and addressing basic community needs such&#13;
as drinking water and basic health services for both humans and&#13;
livestock.   A related and ecually important objective is the&#13;
conservation of the natural resource base.  The proposed project&#13;
must be considered to be part of a longer term programme of&#13;
investment in arid land develooment, which contributes to achieving&#13;
broader objectives OL poverty alleviation, sustainable land use,&#13;
and resource conservation.&#13;
This longer-ter-m perspective has indeed been central in the&#13;
design of some of the main strategies and actions which will be&#13;
implemented by the Government (under the aegis of ALRMP and under&#13;
other  future  relevant programmes/development initiatives),  to&#13;
address the key constraints and issues hindering the development of&#13;
the Arid Lands, viz., degradation of the natural resource base,&#13;
increasing freauency and intensity of droughts, poor marketing&#13;
facilities and inadequate infrastructure leading to lack of&#13;
integration of the area with the national economy, inadequate level&#13;
of social services available to Arid Land populations, and lack of&#13;
an adequate policy framework with regard to pastoralists' rights&#13;
e.g. land ownership and grazing rights.&#13;

Strategies and Actions&#13;
E.nvironmental and Natural Resources Conservation and Manaaement:&#13;
Te- arid areas of Kenya are freauently affected by drought, which,&#13;
Cgven the loss of dry-season grazing land and inadequate drought&#13;
m-tigation activities over the last forty years, has had adverse&#13;
environmental impact. The National Environment Action Plan (NEAP),&#13;
completed in June 1994, along with the Environmental Action Plan&#13;
.or the ASAL, will provide the basic framework and guidelines for&#13;
environmental and natural resources conservation and management&#13;
with regard to the arid lands.  Both of these plannina exercises&#13;
took the view that, policy and legal issues pertainirng to the arid&#13;
lands were inadeauately addressed,  and that initiatives in this&#13;
regard needed to be supported by further careful analysis of the&#13;
ractors which continue to contribute to the deterioration of the&#13;
natural resource base. Under the proposed project a series of in-&#13;
depth studies of these factors will be designed and carried out by&#13;
Q97.   The findings and recommendations  of these studies, if&#13;
accepted  by  Government,  will  guide  policy  and  legislative&#13;
fo-rulation in a way which more fully aligns develooment programes&#13;
w-ith  sustainable natural resource  management objectives.   The&#13;
Project will support a range of other appropriate actions, by&#13;
working with pastoralists to identify common resource management&#13;
Cobj ectives and strategies, which will bring about improvements in&#13;
the management of community resources and fragile environments&#13;
t: rough measures such as,  limiting access to c-itical grazing&#13;
reserves   and  their  rehabilitation;   reinforcing  traditional&#13;
production sys.ems to manage resources; encouraging development of&#13;
coth  livestock  and  alternative  (non-livestock  based)  income&#13;
cen.erating activities to increase offtake of local output; and&#13;
local capacity building measures, to promote mobility thereby&#13;
recducing the dependence and pressure on Arid Land resources. These&#13;
measures will reduce degradation of the natural resource base, and&#13;
possibly reverse it. ..ALRMP would thus strengthen and support&#13;
i-.tiatives to better mahage these fragile lands, during droughts&#13;
or  normal  periods.   The proposed  project will foster local&#13;
carticipation through the design and implementation of community-&#13;
driven initiatives to better manage rangelands, critical grazing&#13;
reserves and other fragile environments, thereby improving the&#13;
longer term viability of pastoral communities. This will also help&#13;
generate a greater awareness of environmental management issues&#13;
amocng the participating communities, the collaborating Governmental&#13;
and Non-Governmental Agencies.&#13;
Effective Drouahe Manaaement:   The increasing frequency and&#13;
severity, of droughts are adversely affecting the economic and&#13;
sccial welfare of the pastoral population in the arid regions. The&#13;
G-cvernment has initiated the develooment of an integrated national&#13;
&#13;

policy on drought management for the Arid Lands. A good start has&#13;
already been made in this regard,  recently,  the Government has&#13;
strengthened the institutional capacity for drought and relief&#13;
ocerations   by  establishing   a   Decartment   of  Relief  and&#13;
Rehabilitation (DRR) in the Office of the President.  The ALRMP&#13;
will  further bolster Government  efforts  in this direction, by&#13;
building umon the activities initiated under the IDA-supcorted&#13;
Emergency Drought Recovery Project (EDRP).  The Government will&#13;
develop and finalize the National Drought Management Policy by the&#13;
end  of  Project Year 2, i.e.  l996/97,  and will establish an&#13;
institutional structure at the national and local levels to&#13;
effectively  manage  all  phases   of  drought,   i.e.,  drought&#13;
preparedness, mitigation and recovery.  Other drought management&#13;
activities will include, the development and implementation of&#13;
Drought Contingency Plans (by 1997) and the completion and adoption&#13;
of Drought Contingency manuals (by 1998); and establishment and&#13;
operation of an Early Warning System.  A Drought Contingency Fund&#13;
w11 also be established, and an Emergency Cereal Reserve will be&#13;
set up with the assistance of World Food Programme and other&#13;
donors,  prior to the project's Mid Term Review in 1998.   The&#13;
strengthening and improvement of customary dry season and drought&#13;
grazing reserves, an annual programme of critical spot improvements&#13;
to kee? the main district access roads serviceable and the&#13;
strengthening of selected populatior centers as Drought mitigation&#13;
Centers, will also be undertaken.  Thus, the Government is seeking&#13;
to build the cacacity, systems and infrastructure for effective&#13;
-rought management.&#13;
I-ntearation of the Arid Larlds into the National Economy: The&#13;
Government recocnizes that poor marketing facilities and inadequate&#13;
infrastructure are major constraints to the well being of arid&#13;
lands people, and that the developmenit of the commercial and rural&#13;
infrastructure  is especially important for realizing the full&#13;
ecoanomic potential ofr-the Arid Lands. The Government thus intends&#13;
to undertake measures to address the bottlenecks that impede market&#13;
linkages between the Arid Lands and the rest of the country (for&#13;
local products), thereby developing outlets for trade and promoting&#13;
economic and geographic mobility of the Arid Land population.&#13;
Measures aimed at strengthening livestock marketing will include&#13;
the rehabilitation and development of market centres, stockroutes&#13;
and holding grounds as well as strengthening the Marketing&#13;
Information System. A study will be carried out in Project Year 1&#13;
to assess the infrastructural recuirements and the modalities of&#13;
involving the private sector for the development of the facilities&#13;
needed, such as slaughter houses. The Government will also support&#13;
local capacity building (primarily through training programmes&#13;
under the Community Development compcnent of ALRMP); with a view to&#13;
cpening up new economic avenues to the pastoralists and improving&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
page 5 of 8&#13;
their soCio-economic status.  Tn this regard, community initiatiTveS&#13;
for developing alte-native or off-farm income generating act.ivities&#13;
will also be encouraged.  Government thus intends to unleash the&#13;
full development potential of the Arid Lands, by establishing&#13;
adequate  marketing  and  infrastructural  facilities  to  improve&#13;
markets and strengthen rural-urban links, utilizing a community-&#13;
based demand driven approach.&#13;
Enhanced level cf Social Services for Arid Land ?oculations:&#13;
The Government is cognizant of the fact that almost the entire&#13;
coculation of the Arid Lands can be classified as livina below the&#13;
poverty line.   Not surprisingly,  social welfare i-ndicators show&#13;
that in terms of access to communications, public health, nutrition&#13;
and education, the predominantlv pastoralist population of the Arid&#13;
Lands, receive only a small fraction of the services available to&#13;
the rest of the Kenyan population.   The Government intends to&#13;
foster considerable imcrovements in the living conditions of the&#13;
Akrid Land populations,  primarily  through the medium o  micro-&#13;
projects identified, planned, imclemented and co-financed by the&#13;
communities (in conjunction with Non-Governmental Acencies). These&#13;
mncro-projects will be conceived and executed within. t:he context of&#13;
tne Community Development component of ALRMP, and will help meet&#13;
basic social needs, in carticular or women and children, through&#13;
the provision of a pacKage of health, nutrition and fccd secu-ity.&#13;
Adecuate Policy Framework fo-r Pastoralists' Richts:  Recent&#13;
Government surveys on lard use and land tenure svstems in arid&#13;
areas have highlighted key issues, including: inadeauacies in the&#13;
colicy and institutional framework for sustainable development of&#13;
arid lands; the need to take special note of traditional and&#13;
customary land use systems; the growing conflict between dirferent&#13;
land  use  system  and  technologies;  the  adverse  impact  of&#13;
fragmentation and individualization on formerly communal lands, the&#13;
need for coordinated land and other natural resource (including&#13;
water and grazing lands) utilization practices, etc.  In light of&#13;
the above, the Government has set up a task force to review the&#13;
cu-rent legal framework countrywide.   The Government will also&#13;
carry out studies (primarily with local technical assistance) to&#13;
identify the lacuna in the existing laws and regulations pertaining&#13;
to the development of the arid lands.   These studies will be&#13;
financed from the proceeds of the p-roposed Credit.  One of the&#13;
studies to be carried out, utilizing some eight man-months of&#13;
primarily local consultants, will undertake a thorough review of&#13;
issues pertaining to land tenure, grazing and other rights of the&#13;
pastoralists.  Furthermore, the study will propose instruments to&#13;
prooerly enforce and protect the rights of the castoralist&#13;
communities.    Should  the  existing  legal  framewor'k  be  found&#13;
inadecuate, new legal instruments, or amendments to existing laws,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
to achieve such objectives, will be prooosed.  This review will be&#13;
completed within the second year of the project, and a plan of&#13;
action will be drawn up in consultation with IDA to implement the&#13;
agreed recommendations of this study within a given time-,-ame.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
Project Imnlementation Ancroach:   The bottom-up, community-&#13;
based, demand driven approach proposed in the ALRMP is the&#13;
foundation of the District Focus  Strategy.   This strategy is&#13;
intended   to   decentralize   management   and   implementation&#13;
-esponsibilities,  including  planning  and  monitoring,  to  the&#13;
district  level.    The Government  attaches  importance  to this&#13;
approach which is in line with its policy for developing the ASAL.&#13;
In order to ensure that the districts implementing ALRMP have the&#13;
necessary planning and operational capacity to carry out their&#13;
respective functions, the necessary commensurate administrative and&#13;
financial authority have already been delegated to them.  Details&#13;
on  the  imclementation arrangements  under  ALRMP are presented&#13;
hereunder.&#13;
District Financina Arrancements: The Government is promoting&#13;
a*n interactive imclementation management culture at all levels of&#13;
Government, particularly with regard to the handling of development&#13;
interventions.   A number of project management models have been&#13;
tried; the Government's view is that the model presently being used&#13;
-or EDRP is effective and should be adopted for the ALRIMP with&#13;
suitable modifications.  Tn this regard, existing arrangements for&#13;
EDRP for making provision in the budget and for transferring&#13;
project funds to the district for meeting the costs of district-&#13;
based activities will be applied to ALRMP.   These arrangements&#13;
involve budgeting for project expenditures under one ministry (the&#13;
Office  of  the  President  in  this  case),  Authoritv  to  Incur&#13;
Expenditure (AIE) draw% up only in favour of the District Project&#13;
Coordinator in each proj4ct district, backed by sufficiently large&#13;
cash transfers to each district, to fully meet the recuirements of&#13;
project expenditures.&#13;
Other   Implementation   Arrancements:          For   effective&#13;
imDlementation of the project, the Government has planned several&#13;
monitorable actions to be undertaken by the ministries, and the&#13;
field agencies in a given timeframe so that all the necessary&#13;
institutional arrangements are in place for timely project startup.&#13;
These activities are detailed below:&#13;
(a)  The Government will establish a National Support Unit, the&#13;
Drought Management Secretariat, and the District Support Units&#13;
by July 1995 and have in place the core professional staff&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44 -                             Annex 1&#13;
Page 7 of 8&#13;
within this oeriod.  The Government has also drawn uo the&#13;
Terms  of Reference  of  the  key  agencies,  which would be&#13;
responsible  for  project  management  implementation  (e.g.&#13;
Project Steerina Committee, District Steering Committees) and&#13;
included these in the Project Implementation Plan (2IP)   A&#13;
cony of the Draft PIP was furnished to IDA at negotiations.&#13;
The  finalized  PIP  will  be  furnished  prior  to  credit&#13;
- effectiveress.&#13;
(b)  Appropriate budgetary provisions for the project have been&#13;
included in the forward budget and will be made in the printed&#13;
estimates  of the  FY  95/96  budget.   The  latte- will be&#13;
finalised by the end of June, 1995.&#13;
(c)  The  Government  regards  the  training  of  the  community&#13;
leaders/members and implementing officials as being crucial&#13;
for effective project implementation. Therefore, the training&#13;
plan for FY96 has already been drawn up and furnished to IDA&#13;
at negotiations.  In future, training clans in resoect of the&#13;
next fiscal year will be drawn up annually by March  and&#13;
furnished to IDA on a timely basis.&#13;
(d)  The Government has acreed to use the established procurement&#13;
guidelines of COK for the community micro-projects.  These&#13;
procurement  guidelines  are  deemed  to  be  adeouate  for&#13;
implementing the community micro-projects to be carried out&#13;
under the Communrty Developmen_ and other comoonents of ALRMP.&#13;
In  accordance  with  these   procedures,   presently,   all&#13;
procurements upto Kenya Shillings two million (US$40,000)&#13;
per item may be effected at the district level, without the&#13;
intervention of the Central Tender Board. The choice of using&#13;
either auotation (local shopping) or open tendering is at the&#13;
discretion of the districts.  It is deemed that procurements&#13;
for the micro projects under CDP will be adeauately effected&#13;
at  district  lever  (utilizing  the  existing  procurement&#13;
procedures).&#13;
(e)  The initial procurement plan has been drawn up and furnished&#13;
to IDA at negotiations.  The Government has also agreed to&#13;
utilize the Banks's Standard Bidding Documents for Procurement&#13;
of Goods and Works, as well as the Standard Form of Contract&#13;
for Consultants' Services.&#13;
(f)  The key indicators for project implementation as well as the&#13;
operational indicators have been discussed and finalized&#13;
during negotiations.&#13;
(g)  An appropriate financial management and accounting system is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

in place for the EDRP.  This system will be applied to ALRMP&#13;
with  suitable modifications,  and will become operational&#13;
before credic effectiveness.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
In recent years, the Government of Kenya has undertaken&#13;
various policy reforms aimed at promoting equitable and sustainable&#13;
economic development in the Arid Lands. It is, however, recognized&#13;
that the challenges or achieving widespread poverty reduction,&#13;
prudent   natural   resources   management   and   environmental&#13;
conservation,  are considerable.   The challen2ge is rooted in the&#13;
longer term nature of the problem, and the search for substantive&#13;
and effective solutions.   The implementation of the programme&#13;
described above must be seen to be part of a broader framework for&#13;
action in the Arid Lands, promoting sustainable and broad-based&#13;
economic growth, poverty reduction, and environmental management.&#13;
The Government also believes that the proposed ALRMP and other&#13;
cdonor-assisted programmes, will play an important role in&#13;
facilitating the implementation of critically needed policy reforms&#13;
with a view to promoting economic and geographic mobility of the&#13;
Arid Land population over the longer term. The Government is keen&#13;
to continue working with the Bank to ensure that the proposed&#13;
project becomes effective at the earliest opportunity, and that it&#13;
4s implemented successfully.&#13;

ARID LANDS RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Past and Ongoing Programs in the Area&#13;
1.    Although a number of multilateral and bilateral development projects have been introduced in&#13;
ASALs in the last two decades, with the exception of a few these have largely focussed on the&#13;
relatively better off semi-arid lands. The only major investment effort supported by IDA in the arid&#13;
lands is the EDRP which is being implemented in four arid districts, namely Mandera. Marsabit,&#13;
Turkana and Tana River (extended to Wajir district during the Mid-term Review). The project&#13;
objective is to assist the ASAL populations affected by the 1992 drought to begin a sustainable&#13;
recovery process. The project components include agriculture, livestock, drought management and&#13;
environment, infrastructure, water management, health services and capacity building. The project&#13;
became effective in April 1993 and at mid-term (April 1994) the project had disbursed approximately&#13;
US$9.6 million and committed another US$9.2 million. Under the project financing plan IDA will&#13;
provide a total assistance of US$27.25 million which includes US$7.25 million diverted for use by&#13;
EDRP from three IDA-supported Credits in Kenya. The project after a slow start has gained&#13;
momentum and the implementation of various project activities, with the exception of the&#13;
infrastructure component, is satisfactory. EDRP has initiated several steps, particularly after re-&#13;
structuring during the mid-term review, for securing the objectives that the project investments are&#13;
sustainable and benefits reach the target populations. Community mobilization and participation as&#13;
appropriate would be a necessary prerequisite for project investments particularly in community&#13;
oriented development interventions. The rehabilitated dams, water pans and boreholes in Mandera&#13;
and Marsabit districts have been handed over to communities for operation and management. The&#13;
animal health component has carried out a vaccination campaign and created a revolving fund for&#13;
regular replenishment of these stocks in the future. The drought management component has begun&#13;
the process of establishing drought monitoring systems in three districts. These activities would&#13;
dovetail into the ALRMP.&#13;
2.    The second important project is the European Union (EU)-funded Kenya Livestock&#13;
Development Program (KLDP) which mainly financed livestock infrastructure, a nucleus of extension&#13;
services, a water component to rehabilitate and establish boreholes and water troughs for the&#13;
livestock. A recent evaluation study, however, rates the project at mid-term as not having achieved&#13;
its objectives. The report ascribes this failure to inadequacies in preparation and appraisal followed by&#13;
poor implementation. The water rehabilitation component, however, was a success in one district and&#13;
the establishment of water user associations was a notable achievement. The evaluation study has a&#13;
word of advice on projects implemented with community participation:&#13;
Several points must be acknowledged in advance when trying to implement&#13;
community-led microprojects. Most importantly, all parties have to recognize and&#13;
resist the temptation to try to do too much, too fast. Microprojects which are most&#13;
likely to succeed are those based on what has succeeded in that type of place, in the&#13;
past (rather than on "good ideas"); involve several rounds of negotiations between&#13;
concerned parties, (rather than one party dictating the pace of discussion); and&#13;
which spring from the needs of the beneficiaries rather than from assumptions by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
Annex 2&#13;

outsiders of what communities need. Furthermore, microprojects must be small in&#13;
scale, to be manageable.&#13;
3.     The Pastoralist Integrated Development Project (PIDP), funded by the United Nations&#13;
Development Program (UNDP) and executed by the Bank on their behalf, is a small scale investment&#13;
program focussing on the communities' need for drinking water for humans and livestock. Using this&#13;
as an entry point, it promotes several other community-led development interventions; e.g. sanitary&#13;
latrines, energy efficient cooking, hygiene and nutrition. Currently it is the leading multi-lateral&#13;
project to apply a participatory approach to implementation. The project covers three arid districts&#13;
(Wajir, Marsabit and Mandera) and two semi-arid districts (Laikipia and Baringo). In the Laikipia&#13;
and Marsabit districts, NGOs are co-financiers and administer the program in the field. Its&#13;
implementation strategy promotes a high degree of self-reliance by providing external financial&#13;
assistance only as a help of last resort. The program in Laikipia is implemented by cohesive&#13;
women's self-help associations bound together by a legal agreement obliging each member to fulfil&#13;
her share of contribution in cash, kind and labor until project completion. The results on the ground&#13;
are satisfactory.&#13;
4.    In three arid districts (Mandera, Wajir, Garissa) the UNICEF supported Nomadic Primary&#13;
Health Care Project (NPHC) has started well and underscores the importance of community-based&#13;
approaches. The program is coordinated by the District Inter-sectoral Committee (includes NGOs and&#13;
multi-sectoral agencies) and seeks to establish Village Inter-sectoral Committees for the day to day&#13;
management of local components and funds. The prograrn concentrates on health and nutrition, water&#13;
and livestock, environmental resources and education. Its main focus is the nomadic population and,&#13;
working through traditional structures, it lays major emphasis on the inter-linkages between the&#13;
sectors.&#13;
5.    The Drought Management Project (DMP) funded by the Netherlands targets four arid districts&#13;
(Turkana, Marsabit, Isiolo and Samburu) and supports the establishment of a drought monitoring&#13;
system, including a Drought Management System (DMS). A regional center has been established in&#13;
Samburu which coordinates the activities of the district teams and produces early warning bulletins&#13;
and literature for the administration and public. The program does not have formal institutional&#13;
linkages with the district administration, and that has raised questions about the integration of the&#13;
EWS into the national decision making process. The government is negotiating with the Dutch and&#13;
the WFP an extension of the DMP for four more years in these districts. After extension the DMP is&#13;
expected to finance the costs of vehicles and equipment,EWS operations, training, civil works and&#13;
non-salary operating costs of the program in these districts. However, DMP will utilize the district&#13;
and national institutional arrangement to be created under the ARLMP for project management.&#13;
6.     Other small bilateral programs include the Swedish International Development Agency (Water&#13;
and Soil Conservation), the African Muslim Agency (Water and Conservation); Norwegian Aid&#13;
(Cooperatives), Irish Concern (Sanitation), and Danish International Development Agency (Rural&#13;
Development Fund) used to assist schools, water and health components and local crafts.&#13;
7.     Besides these multilateral and bilateral projects, a number of small focussed projects to&#13;
address community needs have been undertaken by several NGOs; most with external financing.&#13;
Community participation is a common feature of these development interventions. The NGO-assisted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
projects are generally demand driven and strive to establish community ownership. Notable projects&#13;
and interventions by NGOs are: the Farm Africa's Camel Development Project in Samburu and&#13;
Marsabit; Emergency Pastoralist Assistance Group's (EPAG) project in Mandera for livestock&#13;
marketing, health care and restocking; Oxfam assisted programn for livestock veterinary care in&#13;
Turkana; Catholic Relief Service funded activities in community health and water projects in Tana&#13;
River; income-generating and restocking activities in Isiolo promoted by Catholic Mission Garba&#13;
Tula; Catholic Church sponsored child health care program in Turkana; and School Construction and&#13;
Equipment Program operated by the Tenrikyo Society (Japan) in Garissa.&#13;
8.    Reviews of the initiatives supported by donors and non-governmental agencies have identified&#13;
a number of constraints faced by development interventions in the ALs. These include: (a) inadequate&#13;
implementation capacity in the central government and in the districts; (b) project complexity; (c) top-&#13;
down approach and lack of beneficiary involvement; (d) inadequate and/or untimely release of both&#13;
foreign and counterpart funds; (e) procurement delays; (f) lack of project ownership; and (g)&#13;
inadequate preparation for project activities and unrealistic targets.&#13;

ARID LANDS RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
DROUGHT MANAGEMENT COMPONENT&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The Drought Monitoring Component of the Arid Lands Resource Management Project,&#13;
following the work of IDA-supported Emergency Drought Recovery Project (EDRP), would establish&#13;
an institutional structure at the national and local levels to effectively manage all phases of drought;&#13;
i.e. drought preparedness, mitigation, and recovery. The component consists of three parts:&#13;
*     Establishment of a National Structure to enact policies and carry out operational&#13;
responsibilities for drought management, both within the arid lands and countrywide.&#13;
This structure would become a permanent part of the Department of Relief and&#13;
Rehabilitation.&#13;
*     Establishment of District Structures: for each of the eight project districts, a District&#13;
Project Support Unit would be created containing capacity for drought management.&#13;
*     Support to drought mitigation interventions and post-drought recovery.&#13;
Background&#13;
2.    Droughts occur in the arid lands of Kenya periodically and with variable intensity. More&#13;
severe droughts occur every eight to ten years while the less severe ones occur at intervals of three to&#13;
four years. A few prolonged droughts (e.g. 1964-65, 1984-85 and 1991-93) led to famnine conditions&#13;
in some parts of the country, particularly in the arid lands. In recent years, there were severe&#13;
droughts in Kenya in 1960-61, 1964-65, 1974-75, 1979-80, 1984-85 and 1991-93. In the 1980s&#13;
minor droughts occurred in 1983, 1987 and 1989.&#13;
3.    Droughts result in considerable social and economic disruption due to loss of livestock and&#13;
other food production, and make people, particularly the poor (women and children) very vulnerable.&#13;
During the severe drought of 1984-85, maize production declined by 30 percent and bean production&#13;
by 70 percent. Livestock population declined by 40 percent. During the drought of 1990, crop&#13;
output fell by 18 percent, and further declined by 14 percent in 1991. Coffee production declined by&#13;
22 percent. Cattle slaughters increased by over 10 percent and 17 percent during 1990 and 1991&#13;
respectively, while slaughter of sheep and goats went up by 21 percent and 12 percent respectively.&#13;
Mortality rates of cattle during the droughts of 1991-93 were as high as 40 percent.&#13;
4.    The herding practices of pastoralists in the arid lands are well adapted to drought conditions.&#13;
Diversified herds are divided into small units for mobility to gain access to variable water and fodder&#13;
resources; exchange of animals through kinship, marriage and friendship ties keep animals dispersed&#13;
over a wide area, and helps rebuild herds after losses from drought. These coping mechanisms,&#13;
however, are being undermined by population growth, increasing sendentarization around fixed water&#13;
points and the loss of dry season grazing areas to other groups and uses. Disruptions in livestock&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
marketing caused by insecurity have further impoverished pastoralists. Losses of livestock during&#13;
droughts caused newly destitute pastoralists to migrate to rural and urban centers in search of food aid&#13;
and employment, thereby further putting pressure on the limited infrastructure and grazing land in&#13;
these centers.&#13;
5.    Thus far, the national response to drought has largely been in terms of adhoc emergency food&#13;
assistance. Instead of drought management, the focus has been on relief food supply, special feeding&#13;
programs, water supply and mobile health delivery. Long-term management has been confined to&#13;
providing food security through price stabilization policies, food subsidies, food distribution,&#13;
rehabilitation and provision of additional water sources and supplementary health programs. These&#13;
efforts lack integration and as a long- term strategy for drought management, they are not sustainable.&#13;
6.     Although the Government has formulated a draft drought contingency plan (1992) and a few&#13;
other related policy instrumentsl/, none of these has been formally adopted or operationalized.&#13;
Projects like the EDRP and the Dutch-funded Drought Management Project have yielded positive&#13;
lessons for drought forecasting and drought mitigation and have laid the groundwork for further&#13;
action. However, a comprehensive national drought management policy, with institutional structures&#13;
and procedures at the national and district level for effectively dealing with all phases of drought ( e.g&#13;
contingency plans, drought manuals) are still missing. The drought management component of the&#13;
ALRMP will fill in these missing links.&#13;
Goal and Objectives&#13;
7.    The overall goal of the Drought Management Component is to institutionalize the management&#13;
of drought in Kenya into the planning and decision-making processes of the Government in co-&#13;
operation with the arid lands communities. This will facilitate the effective planning, progranmming,&#13;
and disbursement of resources to the districts at the appropriate time. The component shall evolve&#13;
into a permanent mechanism for coordination of drought-related activities between Government,&#13;
donors, NGOs and local communities. Participation by pastoral communities will guide the specific&#13;
priorities for an area before an intervention. The final product will be a national drought management&#13;
system with a sustainable capacity to cope with drought situations.&#13;
8.    To achieve the goals, the Drought Management component has the following objectives:&#13;
*     To establish a Drought Management System, comprising policy, institutional&#13;
structures and capacity to cope with drought at national, district and community levels&#13;
on an integrated and sustainable basis.&#13;
*     To develop districts as the basic units of drought management by strengthening their&#13;
capacity for drought forecasting and preparedness; mitigation of impact; and&#13;
coordinated recovery.&#13;

*     To establish a clear institutional structure for co-ordinating multi-disciplinary activities&#13;
amongst various actors involved both within the Government and outside.&#13;
*     To enable communities to actively participate in drought preparedness, intervention&#13;
and recovery.&#13;
Approach&#13;
9.    The Drought Management component will build on the institutional structure piloted by the&#13;
Emergency Drought Recovery Project (EDRP), under the Department of Relief and Rehabilitation&#13;
(DRR), in the Office of the President. It will underscore the economic rationality of arid lands people&#13;
for better use of their limited natural resource endowment through pastoralism, and will further build&#13;
on the strengths of their traditional drought coping mechanisms through community participation and&#13;
training.&#13;
Implementing Arrangements&#13;
(a) National Level&#13;
10.   At the national level, the project will establish a Drought Management Secretariat (DMS)&#13;
under the Department of Relief and Rehabilitation in the Office of the President. The DMS will carry&#13;
out Government's policy and operational responsibilities for drought management. DMS will at the&#13;
initial stage of the program will include one incremental professional staff: a Drought Monitoring&#13;
Officer, with support staff to include a data analyst/secretary. The DMS will be housed at the&#13;
Drought Management Center (DMC) which will have a Geographical Information System (GIS)&#13;
facility. A provision has been provided for short term technical assistance for the preparation of&#13;
manuals and contingency plans.&#13;
11.   The DMS will perform two distinct functions:&#13;
*     the development of a national policy on drought management, the preparation of&#13;
national drought manuals and contingency plans; supervising the preparation of a&#13;
model district drought manual and model district drought contingency plan; and&#13;
supervising the preparation of drought manuals and district contingency plans for the&#13;
target districts; and the establishment of an Drought Monitoring System.&#13;
*     Strategic planning and management of droughts and famines in the arid lands,&#13;
including integration of relief operations with drought management, and later, after&#13;
preparatory work and suitable strengthening, drought management country-wide.&#13;
12.   The DMS will have the overall responsibility for drought management activities described in&#13;
the project. It will coordinate drought management activities outside the project area and will be&#13;
responsible for preparation of model district drought manuals, model district contingency plans, and&#13;
national drought manual and national contingency plan. The drought monitoring officer will guide the&#13;
in the preparation of district drought manuals and district contingency plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
13.   The DMS will prepare and submit drought assessment reports to NRRCC and after obtaining&#13;
its approval, advise the Government to declare drought in the affected area. After formal declaration&#13;
of drought by the Government, various related Ministries of the Government and the DSUs will&#13;
undertake appropriate drought mitigation and recovery activities which are laid down in the drought&#13;
manual and included in the contingency plan.&#13;
(b) The District Structure&#13;
14.   In all project districts, a District Support Unit (DSU) will be created. In Turkana, the&#13;
existing Drought Contingency Planning Unit (TDCPU) will be renamed. The drought management&#13;
capacity will be created within the DSU. The District Project Coordinator (DPC) will also function&#13;
as the principal drought management officer and will be assisted by a Drought Monitoring Officer.&#13;
The DSU will be responsible for strategic planning (including development of district contingency&#13;
plan and district manual), periodic updating of the manual and, during droughts, act as the chief&#13;
operations officer for drought mitigation. It will operate the Drought Monitoring System (DMS),&#13;
prepare periodical drought forecasts based on analysis of the data gathered through the EWS, and&#13;
compile the inception report on impending droughts for the consideration of the DRRC. The DRRC&#13;
would record its recommendations to the DRR in OP for declaring a district or a part of a district&#13;
drought-affected. Such declaration by the Government would trigger implementation of the district&#13;
contingency plan in terms of the process and procedures set out in the district drought manual. The&#13;
district staff for drought management will be housed in the Drought Management Center (DMC),&#13;
equipped with computer and radio communication facilities. The activities of the DSU for drought&#13;
management are summarized below:&#13;
*     Establish and operate the drought Drought Monitoring System (DMS).&#13;
*     Prepare district drought manual and district contingency plan following the model&#13;
developed by DMS.&#13;
*     Assess drought situations following the established process and update the contingency&#13;
plans.&#13;
*     Take steps for declaration of drought in terms of the process established&#13;
under the district drought manual.&#13;
*     Plan and implement drought mitigation and recovery interventions.&#13;
*     Appraise, monitor and evaluate the above.&#13;
Drought Contingency Fund and Emergency Cereal Reserve&#13;
15.   As part of the district drought contingency plan, a Drought Contingency Fund would be&#13;
established at the national level for the target districts, to be utilized for immediate drought mitigation&#13;
interventions. The fund would cover activities such as health and nutritional support to the vulnerable&#13;
groups; operation of emergency stock routes for livestock evacuation and drought grazing reserves;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 5 of 8&#13;
emergency veterinary campaigns for disease control to avoid large-scale livestock deaths; as well as&#13;
other activities approved under the national or district contingency plans. An Emergency Cereal&#13;
Reserve of about 15,000 metric tons for the target districts, created with the support of the donor&#13;
agencies, will maintain stocks for about one month supply for emergency relief feeding and for&#13;
limited food-for-work (FFW) interventions. The stocks will be maintained by the National Cereals&#13;
and Produce Board (or any other agency designated by the Government) at the level of 2000 metric&#13;
tons for a district (1000 metric tons for Isiolo). The project will bear limited costs for management&#13;
of the Emergency Cereal Reserve. The District Contingency Fund and the Emergency Cereal&#13;
Reserve will equip the districts to handle the first critical phase of drought with local resources, thus&#13;
reducing widespread losses and disease, until further support can be mobilized. Modalities for&#13;
accessing the fund and for the establishment of the Drought Contingency Fund and Emergency Cereal&#13;
Reserve will be worked out during thefirst year of the project. These facilities will be operational by&#13;
the time of mid- term review.&#13;
Drought Mitigation Interventions&#13;
16.   Drought mitigation interventions will be planned and implemented at the district level, with&#13;
support and supervision from the DMS. Activities to support interventions will include:&#13;
funding the civil works, equipment and technical assistance to develop capacities of&#13;
selected population centers where pastoralists migrate in large numbers during&#13;
distress, to be effective drought mitigation centers. A minimum level of water, health&#13;
and other common facilities will be maintained. Facility profiles of these centers will&#13;
be developed to record and analyze the existing situation, and plans to strengthen&#13;
minimum levels of infrastructure (water, health and veterinary facilities) for increased&#13;
demands during drought will be prepared.&#13;
*     surveys, in consultation with local communities, of the rangelands in the target&#13;
districts to identify potential drought grazing reserves. The identified areas will be&#13;
demarcated and gazetted, and appropriate water resources developed where needed.&#13;
Local communities will manage these facilities and be responsible for their protection&#13;
and maintenance. They will be trained for these tasks, as required. These activities&#13;
will be closely coordinated with the Marketing component.&#13;
*     provision of spares and repairs for equipment, tools, and associated operating costs of&#13;
the District Works Office (DWO) in order to strengthen their road maintenance&#13;
capacity and to carry out spot improvement of important roads in the district, using,&#13;
as far as possible, low-cost labor-intensive technologies. Assistance under the project&#13;
would fit within the Government's evolving policy on road maintenance under the&#13;
"Roads 2000" program. The DWO will, in close coordination with DSU, prepare a&#13;
shelf of labor- intensive road maintenance projects that can be carried out under FFW&#13;
arrangements during drought periods. The Drought Management Center and the&#13;
DWO will liaise closely in the management of these activities. It is expected that all&#13;
spot improvement proposals initiated by DWO (in consultation and close co-ordination&#13;
with DSU) will be cleared by the District Steering Group (DSG). The DSU would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 3&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
supervise the implementation of these works to see that these conform to the plans and&#13;
strategy approved by the DSG.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
17.   Project monitoring at regular intervals will include the timely submission of progress reports&#13;
and workplans. The following reports will be prepared by the Drought Management Coordinator:&#13;
*     Quarterly Progress Reports on the implementation of annual work plans will be&#13;
submitted indicating progress made and shortcomings or obstacles faced and stating&#13;
remedial actions required to improve progress.&#13;
*     Annual Progress Reports will be submitted to NRRCC indicating project&#13;
achievements and shortfalls, if any, and the activities included in the next annual work&#13;
plan.&#13;
*     Mid-Tern Report, following the mid-term review, will highlight progress made in&#13;
achievement of key performance indicators, shortfalls, if any, and lessons learned for&#13;
future project implementation. Adjustments and revisions including a revised project&#13;
estimate, will be included.&#13;
*     The Final Report will be prepared at the termination of the project. The report will&#13;
highlight physical, social and financial achievements and organizational and process&#13;
constraints. It will make recommendations for future action.&#13;
Monitoring Indicators&#13;

ARID LANDS RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
MARKETING AND INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENT&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The broadest justification for a Marketing Component in the Arid Lands Resource&#13;
Management Project is the near total dependence on livestock of the pastoralist commnunities for their&#13;
livelihood and social life. Exchanging animal products for cash and kind is part of the pastoral&#13;
production system. In addition to benefitting pastoralists, efficient marketing of livestock from the&#13;
arid lands would benefit the national economy. Over the last 10 years, an average livestock offtake&#13;
figures for the arid lands were 7.0 percent for cattle, 8.0 percent for sheep and goats and about 1.5&#13;
percent for camels. If the current marketing system were improved, these figures could conservatively&#13;
be raised and sustained at approximately 11 percent, 25 percent and 3 percent respectively. Also&#13;
when pastoralists are able to achieve a measure of economic resilience, the high costs of providing&#13;
extensive food aid can be avoided. Finally, pastoralism is a productive use of resources in the arid&#13;
lands which makes use of skills developed over a lifetime. In many cases, it is the only system that&#13;
can convert the arid land resources of fodder and water into goods that are directly usable by man.&#13;
This is a positive alternative to competing for unskilled jobs in the overcrowded cities.&#13;
2.    Over the years a number of centrally-planned projects for improving the livestock marketing&#13;
system have been implemented in Kenya with little success. The reason for the failure is that the&#13;
pastoralists were not actively involved in making the critical decisions. It is now realized that for&#13;
these development initiatives to succeed the pastoralists should actively participate in decisions that&#13;
affect their lives. This would be the basic approach to be adopted in implementing the Marketing&#13;
component under the ALRMP. Communities will identify their most urgent marketing-related issues&#13;
and participate in finding solutions that reflect their experience. They will be encouraged to form&#13;
legal entities which will be assisted with funds to complement their own efforts. Communities and&#13;
user-groups will have a central role in identifying, planning and, where feasible, implementing the&#13;
development initiatives under this component.&#13;
Goal and objectives&#13;
3.    The goal of the Marketing Component of the ALRMP is to address the bottlenecks that&#13;
impede market linkages between the Arid Lands and the rest of the economy by increasing the&#13;
number and efficiency of existing outlets for range livestock products. To achieve this goal the&#13;
Marketing component will pursue the following objectives:&#13;
*     To enable pastoralists to set the priorities of the activities supported under the&#13;
Marketing component.&#13;
*     To establish a marketing system that enables pastoralists to move their livestock and&#13;
sell them when and where they want at competitive prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
*      To secure and rehabilitate or create the infrastructure that is essential to the movement&#13;
of livestock - such as along the trekking routes, holding facilities and market yards at&#13;
the selling points.&#13;
*      To establish a livestock marketing-information system that will improve access to&#13;
market information and facilitate efficient decision-making regarding sale and&#13;
purchase of livestock by producers, traders and butchers in Kenyan markets.&#13;
*      To address and help resolve the issues of insecurity in the Arid Lands that hamper the&#13;
movement of livestock. Best practices for conflict resolution will be compiled and fora&#13;
established to resolve outstanding issues.&#13;
*      To improve the marketing and quality of hides and skins through training and support&#13;
to community groups for the establishment of community-owned drying sheds&#13;
(bandas).&#13;
*      To create an enabling environment for private-sector investments in facilities and for&#13;
itinerant trade by identifying and assisting small traders, butchers, and craftsmen at&#13;
the community level.&#13;
Current Status of Livestock Marketing&#13;
4.     Until 1984, the Livestock Marketing Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock&#13;
Development and Marketing, along with the Kenya Meat Commission, held a livestock marketing&#13;
monopoly in the Arid Lands. Only permits to take livestock to KMC were issued from Northern&#13;
Kenya, and LMD was the sole dealer in immatures. This led to the arbitrary fixing of producer&#13;
prices, long delays in payment to producers, and large operating losses which were borne by the tax&#13;
payers. Under the current initiatives of the Government, livestock marketing has been liberalized and&#13;
the role of LMD of the Ministry of Agriculture is now restricted to providing marketing information.&#13;
Further KMC has been re-structured and will compete on an equal footing with the private sector.&#13;
5.     To date most terminal markets are characterized by artificial gluts and shortages created by&#13;
lack of information and the inability of traders, who supply the markets from diverse places all over&#13;
East Africa, to know what is going on in other parts of the marketing system. This sends prices on a&#13;
roller coaster and makes trading in livestock a speculative exercise. Traders increase their risk&#13;
premiums to cover anticipated losses related to price fluctuations. This in turn reduces the price&#13;
producers get. For example when Nairobi slaughterhouses face a surplus and prices fall, traders hold&#13;
their livestock in Marsabit to avoid making losses. The LMD and GTZ are collaborating to supply&#13;
market information to Marsabit traders. Reports indicate that as a result of this information, livestock&#13;
originally destined for Ethiopia have at times been re-directed to the Dagoretti and Dandora&#13;
slaughterhouses in Nairobi and fetched higher prices.&#13;
6.     Lack of livestock-marketing related infrastructure, combined with growing insecurity linked to&#13;
civil strife in neighboring countries, has reduced both the number of livestock traders and the&#13;
numbers of livestock trekked by drovers. Livestock traders are also involved in retail and wholesale&#13;
commerce. In the more distant parts of the country the local livestock traders face only token&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
competition and are able to literally dictate prices of goods and livestock. These traders are often the&#13;
sole buyer of the pastoralists' livestock products and the sole seller of the essential grains, clothing,&#13;
sugar and tobacco that are bought with the proceeds.&#13;
7.     Some cross-border trade continues. Communities in Mandera trade with neighboring&#13;
communities in Somalia and Ethiopia; the Gabbra and Boran communities in Marsabit trade their&#13;
camels in Ethiopia and parts of Somalia while the Turkana seem to be sending most of their cattle to&#13;
Uganda and Sudan. These areas have also served as important sanctuaries for Kenyan livestock in&#13;
times of drought. Cross border trade plays an important price stabilizing role. On the positive side,&#13;
swings that one might expect from the large variations in climatic and draught conditions are&#13;
lessened. On the negative side, eradication of some of the most dangerous diseases like CBPP is&#13;
almost impossible. Vaccination measures taken on the Kenyan side are quickly negated when&#13;
unprotected animals cross the border.&#13;

ARID LANDS RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT&#13;
OBJECTIVE&#13;
The objective of the Community Development Component is to increase the communities&#13;
capacities to sustain and develop their livelihoods by dealing with drought cycles in an&#13;
effective way. The Participatory Learning for Action (PLA) approach will be used to&#13;
achieve this objective.&#13;
PARTICIPATORY LEARNING FOR ACTION&#13;
The PLA method is the main tool, tested under the previous project, to assure community&#13;
ownership of activities to be undertaken and responsiveness of line ministries to the&#13;
communities' needs and demands. This method is an improvement upon the Participatory&#13;
Rural Appraisal technique, and focuses in particular on the elaboration of action plans by the&#13;
community members and successful completion of agreed actions.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
PLA has three main objectives:&#13;
1. Confirmation of the assessment of what the communities consider to be their priorities in&#13;
order to generate commitment by communities and line ministries to engage in activities which&#13;
satisfy those priorities;&#13;
2. Assist communities to develop their own action plans for implementation; and&#13;
3. Contribute to the implementation of priority actions within those plans.&#13;
Methodology&#13;
The techniques used to achieve these objectives were originally designed to enable effective&#13;
communication between illiterate communities and uninformed professionals. The purpose of&#13;
these technique was for community members and professionals to analyze together the&#13;
available resources and priority development issues in order to produce a community action&#13;
plan. Examples of tools in this process include social mapping, wealth ranking, institutional&#13;
analysis, problem ranking and analysis. To go beyond the mere analysis of the existing&#13;
situation, and to create a results-oriented momentum within the communities, additional&#13;
techniques were incorporated which involve group management, leadership styles and conflict&#13;
resolution as a prerequisite to implementation of action plans.&#13;
The action plans resulting from the PLA exercises often involve the implementation of&#13;
improved water supply, the establishment of revolving drug funds, or other income generating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
activities. To assure full ownership of the communities in any activity involving physical inputs,&#13;
the principal of joint action will be upheld with the communities contributing at least a&#13;
minimum of 30% and the remaining 70% being contributed by line ministries, collaborating&#13;
agencies and/or ALRMP. The provision of any physical inputs as well as the follow-up&#13;
training and support to community members to successfully manage and implement their action&#13;
plan is part and parcel of the mandate of the respective line ministries.&#13;
In order to carry out the PLA exercises, two teams per district will go through the process with&#13;
four communities per year each. These teams will be composed of technical staff of the&#13;
respective line ministries involved (MOALDM, MLRRWD, MOH, and others as appropriate)&#13;
and from collaborating agencies. By doing so, the respective line ministries can not only&#13;
provide services to the particular partner community involved in the exercise, but can also&#13;
correct their assessment of what the priority needs and demands from the communities are.&#13;
Training&#13;
Two main types of training will be required to fully operationalize the PLA methodology:&#13;
training of staff, and training of community leaders.&#13;
The training of staff comprises (a) an orientation session where staff are familiarized with the&#13;
objectives and methodologies of PLA in the context of the ALRMP; (b) three sessions of eight&#13;
days residential training to acquire full understanding of the respective techniques involved;&#13;
and (c) three sessions of one week practical exercises in a specific nomadic community.&#13;
Successful completion of this training is a prerequisite for staff to participate in the PLA teams.&#13;
Other staff, as well as decision makers at the district and national level will also participate in&#13;
this training.&#13;
Training of community leaders would be provided by the different PLA teams in each of the&#13;
districts. The objective of this training is to enhance the communities' capacity to carry out&#13;
independently the PLA exercises so as to come to well defined and fully owned action plans.&#13;
Community leaders would be trained during three sessions of one week each, involving mainly&#13;
practical exercises, backed-up with adapted theoretical explanations.&#13;
The detailed training plan for the sessions mentioned above will be part of the PIP.&#13;

Building on the experietice acquired under the previous EDRP. the ALRMIP will (a)&#13;
provide a system and policy for effective drought managemernt; and (b) strengthen the&#13;
communities' capacity to deal with further droughts. In order to assure long term&#13;
sustainability, any action or intervention Will be designed to be as cost effective as possible,&#13;
to be community based, and to be implemented through the relevant iine ministries and&#13;
collaborating agencies.&#13;
To be successful however, the line ministries will have to adapt their way of operating to&#13;
the particularities of the Arid Lands (the nomadic character of a large percentage of the&#13;
population, the distances between communities, the continuing effects of the 1993 drought,&#13;
etc.). They will also need strong support and guidance from the National Support UJnit and&#13;
the District Coordinators in the Office of the P esident to meet this challenge The Ministry&#13;
of Agriculture, Livestock Development and MarketIng, the Ministry of L-and Reclanmation,&#13;
Regional and Water Development, and the Ministry of Health have made, during project&#13;
preparation, a broad outline of the adaptations to be made to their respective ways of&#13;
operating in order to become more effective in their response to the communities' needs&#13;
and demands. Other ministries such as the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Public&#13;
Works may go through the same exercise if the need arises in the Course of project&#13;
implementation. During the respective district launching workshops, the staff of each line&#13;
department will examine how the different frameworks for action can be best implemented,&#13;
taking the local conditions into account. Yearly f1olloW-up workshops will be organized in&#13;
each district to critically examine and improve the effectiveness of the current way of&#13;
operating.&#13;
A. Office of the President - Departinent for Relief and Rehabilitation&#13;
The Department for Relief and Rehabilitation (DRR) is responsible for the overall&#13;
implementation of the ALRMP. To this effect, a National Support Unit (NSU) within the&#13;
DRR is in charge of day to day management and follow-up of the program. More in&#13;
particular, the NSSIJ is responsible for (a) the coordination of the ALRMP; (b) the monthly&#13;
publication of national and district drought statLis reports,  (c) the support and supervision to&#13;
the training initiatives at the district leveil and (d) development and sustainance of drought&#13;
contingency plans and response mechanisms The NSU is headed by the National Prograrn&#13;
Coordinator (NPC), who reports to the Director of Programs in the Office of the President,&#13;
and comprises a drought monitoring officer (DM10), a training officer (TO), and a support&#13;
unit (accounts officef, supplies officer, drivers, secretaries, and messenger). The&#13;
professional staff in the NSU will spend most of their time in the field to assist the&#13;
implementation of the program in the ALs districts. They will give guidance to the District&#13;
Program Coordinators, and will support the respective line departments with the field&#13;
implementation of their activities. In particular, the NSU members will assure the proper&#13;
follow-up for the recommendations made by the PSC&#13;
The District Program Coordinator (DPC) reports to the NPC in the Office of the President&#13;
and at the district level to the District Commissioner   The DPC  has two major&#13;
responsibilities: (a) to provide critical feed back regardinig the efficiency of the respective&#13;
line ministries' field operations, as well as guidance and support needed to plan and&#13;
implement their programr awd (b) the monthly publication of' the drought bulletin It is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 2 of 7&#13;
considered to be of crucial importance for the success of the program that the line ministries&#13;
would have strong and continuous external support from the DPC. In each distnrct, the DPC&#13;
will be assisted by a support unit comprising a supplies assistant, an accounts assistant, and&#13;
three support staff (driver, secretary, messenger). The DPC and the unit will be equipped&#13;
with a 4x4 vehicle and 1w o motor-cycles.&#13;
B. Ministry of Xgriculture, Livestock Development and Marketing&#13;
I.     Animal health and livestock production&#13;
To assure optimal coverage in the most cost effective way, the animal health department&#13;
will work through Community Aninal Health Workers (CAHWs) who will be identified by&#13;
and work within each livestock users association. Each district will have a total of about&#13;
1(00 CAHWs. The CAl iWs will (a) sell basic animal drugs in their community, (b) provide&#13;
first line animal healthi care, and kc) serve as 'contact pastoralists" for the dissemination of&#13;
technical nmessages related to the imiprovement of the herders' capacity to manage their&#13;
livestock. 'I'hese messag,es A1i include issues such as disease prevention, vaccination,&#13;
husbandry practices such as control of parasites, etc The CAHWs will draw a revenue&#13;
from the sales of druos&#13;
Initial training will be provided to Lhe CAI-IWs in two stages: a one week residential&#13;
training course followed three months later by, a three dav refreshet course.&#13;
Once per month, the CAHVWs will have the possibility to meet wAith the front line staff&#13;
(FLS) of the department of veterinary services at a well defined meeting point (e.g. the&#13;
drug store of the livestock users association). Because of the existing distances between the&#13;
communities, their continuous rmovement, and the budgetary constraints, it is not possible&#13;
for the FLS to m1eet easch of the ('AIT's in their o"n homestead. During the monthly&#13;
meetings. the FLS will train the CAl lWs on relevant technical messages After the meeting,&#13;
the FLS and the CAHWs decide if and where the FLS should visit any particular&#13;
commulity.&#13;
One FLS can support about 10 CAHWs. There will be a total of' about 10 FLS in each&#13;
district who 'wlll be stationed at the divisional level and who wIIl be equipped with&#13;
motorcycles. It is not yet clear which altemative should be used in those cases where&#13;
motorcycles are not a practical means of transportation&#13;
Once every three months, the FL.S will participate in a training session. This session will be&#13;
organized by the Disrrict Veterinary Officer (DVO) with the participation of the District&#13;
Livestock ProduLctioni Officer (DLPO). The team of SMS in the Livestock Production&#13;
Departmeni (about three per district) will be responsible for the identification of technical&#13;
messages related to livestock production, and for the training of the FLS during these&#13;
sessions In addition, teach F LS will receive a visit from the DVO and the DLPO once every&#13;
quarter to examine any constraints he/she may encounter in his/her work.&#13;
In order to address problems related to the management of the herds wherefore solutions&#13;
cannot be found at the community level or by the technicians, links with research&#13;
institutions - KARI ajnd any other source of knowledge - would be established. Modalities&#13;
on how this would be done will be worked out during imiplementation.&#13;
Vaccination is part and parcel of the mandate of the department of veterinary services. It is&#13;
understood however that the current system  of vaccination is not performing to full&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
satisfaction. To increase coverage and to minimrize costs, the CAHWs will be involved as&#13;
active partners in the vaccination campaigns. Nevertheless, strengthening of the cold&#13;
storage of vaccines and logistical support will be needed. To make this support possible,&#13;
the staff at the district level will examine ways and means of making the existing&#13;
vaccination effort more effective in coverage.&#13;
2. Crop Production Extension&#13;
Contrary to the high rainfall areas of the country where crop and livestock production are&#13;
being practiced by the same farmer, the pastoralists in the Arid Lands are generally not&#13;
engaged in crop production. The needs for extension of the pastoralists are being addressed&#13;
through the system of CAHWs as described above. Crop production activities in the ALs&#13;
are generally localized in very well defined "pockets" (irrigation schemes, highlands, etc.)&#13;
which vary considerably in size and number of farmers involved - from less than 20 to a&#13;
few hundred.&#13;
To provide extension to the farmers, two scenarios are possible: (a) the front line extension&#13;
worker lives near the agricultural area. He/she provides support to the farmers within&#13;
walking distance. Under this scenario, the FLS does not need any specific means of&#13;
transportation; and (b) the front line staff provide support to a number of farmers in more&#13;
than one location. He/she will than need a motorcycle to visit the farmers. All front line staff&#13;
will meet with farmers on a fortnightly basis.&#13;
The ratio of number of farm families per FLS will vary from district to district. However,&#13;
given the distances to be traveled between different areas where agriculture is being&#13;
practiced, the ratio of FLS per farm families should not exceed one per 200. The actual&#13;
number of FLS also varies considerably (depending on the importance of agriculture in the&#13;
district) but never exceeds about 40 FLS.&#13;
At least once per month, FLS will benefit from supervision. There will be one supervisor&#13;
per five to eight FLS. At the district level, a team of SMS will be responsible for the&#13;
training of FLS. Once per month, the District Agricultural Officer (DAO) will gather all&#13;
FLS in a specific location for this purpose. The DAO will be equipped with a 4x4 vehicle.&#13;
The DAO supervises both the FLS and the supervisors at the divisional level. He/she will&#13;
benefit from supervision from the provincial agricultural officer and the national level (it is&#13;
the responsibility of the national extension service that this supervision actually takes place&#13;
at least once every three months). The District Program Coordinator can flag the issue to&#13;
the Project Steering Committee for appropriate action in those cases where the supervision&#13;
from the provincial and national level would not be effective.&#13;
C. Ministry of Land Reclamation, Regional and Water Development&#13;
At the district level, MILRRWD has the capacity to be involved with about eight new water&#13;
points per year (borehole, dam, shallow well, etc.) The nature of the water point that should&#13;
be installed is decided through the Participatory Rural Appraisal exercise by the community&#13;
and the technicians. More important than the actual installation of the water point is the&#13;
mobilization of the community and its ownership of the management of the water point.&#13;
To achieve these objectives, a team  comprising two technical staff from the Water&#13;
Department as well as a livestock production officer and a social service officer will have a&#13;
series of sessions with the members of the community water association unit. During these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
sessions, issues such as management of the water unit, introduction of the notion of cost&#13;
recovery, the function of Community Water Workers (CWW), etc. are discussed in detail.&#13;
Once the users association has elected a management committee, the team of technical staff&#13;
continues to train the committee members with regard to management skills, operational&#13;
maintenance, book keeping, formulation of bylaws, environmental impact, etc. This training&#13;
is organized through three training sessions of three days each with three months interval.&#13;
The experience in the field indicates that it is very difficult to have actual accountability for&#13;
the management of the water unit (including the collection and use of money from the&#13;
respective users) when the unit is managed by a committee. During project implementation,&#13;
new ideas will be explored to look for ways to improve the efficiency of the community&#13;
water unit management.&#13;
In addition to the election of a management comnittee, the users association identifies&#13;
CWWs - pump attendants, pipe fitters, line patrollers, mechanics and electricians. Each of&#13;
these CWWs participate in an initial technical training of seven days followed by three one&#13;
day refresher courses with three months interval.&#13;
Depending on the nature of the water point, the actual installation is assured by one of three&#13;
technical units - a drilling unit for boreholes, a pump installation unit, or a dam construction&#13;
unit. These units are present in each of the districts and should be equipped with a lorry for&#13;
transportation of material.&#13;
The support to the management and maintenance of the water units is assured through&#13;
monthly visits from the divisional officers (about three per district) to the CWWs. In most&#13;
cases, these officers will be equipped with a motorcycle. (It will be examined which&#13;
alternative can be usec in those areas where motorcycles are not a practical means of&#13;
transportation). In addition, a maintenance unit is on call at the district level to react to&#13;
demands from the respective users associations to intervene for repairs surpassing the&#13;
CWWs' capacity. This maintenance unit comprises an electrician, a plant mechanic, and a&#13;
plumber and will use a 4x4 vehicle equipped with repair tools.&#13;
The technical staff will participate In yearly one week refresher courses to improve&#13;
technical skills and to leam about new technologies such as solar pumps, wind mills, hand&#13;
pumps, etc. These training sessions will be organized by the departments' district based&#13;
staff. The staff participating in the teams that coach the communities to come to full&#13;
ownership of the water points will be trained on community management issues, extension&#13;
training skills, communication skills, group dynamics, accounting, environmental impact,&#13;
sanitation, ea. during a one week initial training session. They will participate in six monthly&#13;
one day refresher courses.&#13;
The divisional water officers will benefit from at least one supervision visit per month by&#13;
the district water engineer. These visits are also instrumental to upgrade the front line&#13;
staffs' skills and to identify further training needs. The district water engineer visits each of&#13;
the communities at least once every quarter to check on the efficiency of the services&#13;
delivered by his/her staff.&#13;
D. Ministry of Health&#13;
Conrmunities can be categorized according to the presence (or absence) of health facilities:&#13;
settlements with a health center or dispensary (Type A), settlements without any health&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -                        Annex 6&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
facility (Type B), and nomadic communities (Type C). In each of these communities, the&#13;
Ministry of Health's Primary Health Care Program has as its objective to assure maximum&#13;
mother and child welfare, to assure treatment of minor ailments, and to provide preventive&#13;
and educational services.&#13;
In each community, a village health committee is elected by the community members.&#13;
Guidance to this process is provided by the Trainer of Trainers at the divisional or location&#13;
level (about four per division). The committee members participate in a one week training&#13;
geared to improve skills related to management, accounting, community dynamics,&#13;
leadership, etc. During a public meeting, the community identifies who of the community&#13;
members can be trained to become a Community Health Worker (CHW, 15 to 20 for a&#13;
population of about 10,000 people). The existing Traditional Birth Attendants (TBA, 2 to 5&#13;
per community) are also proposed to have further training. TBAs have a two week course:&#13;
one week theory and one week practice. The CHWs' initial training is organized in three&#13;
sessions: two weeks of theoretical training, one week of practice, followed by another week&#13;
of theoretical courses. Those CHWs who have some education can be trained further to&#13;
become community trainer of trainers.&#13;
All communities of Type A and B have a cornmunity pharmacy where basic drugs, items&#13;
such as mosquito repellents and nets, and CHW and TBA kits are stored. The pharmacy is&#13;
also used as an information center: basic data on the health situation in the locality are&#13;
displayed on an announcement board. One pharmacy can serve a population of about eight&#13;
to ten thousand people.&#13;
The divisional nomadic primary health care team, constituted of the public health officer&#13;
and a community nurse, will visit Type B communities twice every month on a fixed day.&#13;
Those days, nomadic CHWs can meet with the health care staff for discussion and&#13;
consultation. Any other day, the nomadic CHWs can come to the community for&#13;
replenishment of their small drugs stock and for consultation with community Trainer of&#13;
Trainers. The pharmacies should be self-sustaining units that cover their expenses with the&#13;
revenue from the sales of drugs.&#13;
At the division level there is a health center which is headed by a clinical officer. He/she&#13;
supervises, among other things, the divisional nomadic primary health care team. The&#13;
members of this team are trained during a one week course as TOT and participate in&#13;
continued education courses about once every three months. They are responsible for the&#13;
training of the Village Health Committee members, the CIHWs, and the TBAs, and their&#13;
supervision. The team should be equipped with two motorcycles.&#13;
To provide outreach services (in addition to the primary health care) to the communities of&#13;
Type B and C, a district based team of five officers visit the communities at a well defined&#13;
time and place. They have a van equipped to provide primary curative and preventive health&#13;
care. In optimal conditions, the team can visit each Type B community once every two&#13;
months.&#13;
At the district level, a Nomadic Primary Health Care Core Team of about four members&#13;
under the leadership of the district nomadic primary health care coordinator is responsible&#13;
for the supervision of field activities and the training of staff in the health centers and&#13;
dispensaries. This team reports to the Medical Officer of Health (MOH).&#13;

Issues&#13;
Collaborating Agencies In order to increase sustainability and cost effectiveness, and to&#13;
avoid unnecessary overlapping between different organizations, the respective line&#13;
ministries can sub-contract activities to Collaborating Agencies. Organizations registered&#13;
with the national NGO Bureau, self-help groups registered with the Department of Social&#13;
Services, bi-lateral development organizations, and registered religious bodies are&#13;
examples. Agencies will be assessed according to clearly-defined cnrteria and will first be&#13;
approved by the line ministry concerned and by the District Steenrng Group before the&#13;
proposed collaboration can be approved and formalized at the national level. Examnples of&#13;
qualifying criteria include having a positive track record of working in the area and&#13;
delivering community-based services, respecting the relevant line ministries' policy,&#13;
possessing the necessary technical skills and manpower, and being committed to&#13;
participatory methods of community development. A sample contract for contracting a&#13;
collaborating agency is given in the PIP.&#13;
A mid-term review of the progress and impact of the project interventions will be&#13;
undertaken by the Borrower and the Bank. The report will cover the first three years of&#13;
implementation (FY96-FY98) and cover the following broad areas: (a) effectiveness of the&#13;
drought monitoring and mitigation activities; (b) effectiveness of the field operations of&#13;
each of the line ministries; (c) the physical progress relative to agreed targets: (d) rate of&#13;
disbursements relative to appraisal forecasts, (e) proposals for restructuring the project&#13;
components as needed in light of implementation experience; (f) impact evaluation; (g)&#13;
proposals for inter category reallocation of funds; and (h) status of performance of legal and&#13;
financial covenants and proposals for revisions as needed.&#13;
Gender concerns The project will strive to promote gender balance and incorporate the&#13;
concerns of pastoralist women in project implementation. Women will be encouraged to&#13;
apply for all available positions. Of the two community leaders who will participate in the&#13;
DSC, at least one would be a women. At least one female staff (preferably a local staff&#13;
mastering the community members' language) will be part of the teams responsible for the&#13;
PRA exercises. Finally, the District Program Coordinators will have as a special task to&#13;
monitor the gender responsiveness of each of the line ministries, in particular as related to&#13;
the services provided to the respective communities.&#13;

ARID LANDS RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Summary of the Enviromnental Impact Assessment&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.     A study was conducted in March/April, 1994 to assess the environmental impact of the&#13;
proposed activities of the Arid Lands Resource Management Project.2/ Short field visits to&#13;
Turkana, Marsabit, Wajir and Mandera districts to interview district staff, NGOs, and communities&#13;
supplemented a desk study. The assessment attempted to predict the probable changes ALRMP would&#13;
bring to the socio-economic and bio-physical enviromnent of the arid lands. In all areas of ALRMP&#13;
activities, no significant negative impact on either the bio-physical or socio-economic enviromnent&#13;
were found.&#13;
Background&#13;
2.     Kenya's arid lands cover approximately 63 percent of the country's surface area, and&#13;
classified into two agro-climate zones (VI and VII). The generally bimodal rainfall is erratic, of high&#13;
intensity, short duration and often results in high surface runoff and soil erosion. Soils are&#13;
characterized by low inherent fertility, often forming subsurface hardpan. They have moderate to low&#13;
waterholding capacity; strong surface sealing and crusting properties; high silt and sodium content&#13;
(especially in subsoils); and are highly susceptible to erosion. Most rivers are ephemeral and subject&#13;
to high and low seasonal flows with varying sediment loads. Flash floods in rivers are increasingly&#13;
regulated by dam construction. While this minimizes the destructive effect of the floods on flora and&#13;
fauna, they also have negative impacts, especially in limiting residual moisture agriculture and&#13;
reducing the availability of water (e.g. sand and subsurface dams). Groundwater potential is highly&#13;
variable in quantity and quality; surface water resources are generally scarce and variable.&#13;
3.     Pastoralist production systems, with herds composed of various combinations of camels,&#13;
cattle, goats, sheep and donkeys, are best suited to the arid lands; agriculture is only possible in less&#13;
than one percent of the entire area. Pastoralists have developed strategies to ensure sound utilization&#13;
of natural resources including distinctions between wet and dry season grazing areas, dividing herds&#13;
as precaution against overgrazing and disease, and mobility in response to varying climatic conditions.&#13;
Pastoralists rehabilitate their range by allowing undisturbed growth and seed production during the&#13;
growing period, and avoiding foraging on impoverished pastures. However, increasing loss of dry&#13;
season grazing areas to agriculture and other uses, partly resulting from population overspill from&#13;
high-potential areas of Kenya into semi-arid areas, and, in certain areas, population pressures within&#13;
the arid lands, has led to widespread livestock losses during drought and settlement around relief&#13;
centers. The trend toward sedentarization is also augmented by the fixed services provided by GOK,&#13;
religious groups and NGOs, as well as by the support for agricultural (as opposed to livestock)&#13;
2/  The study was conducted by W.K. Yabann, E.K. Biamah, and A.J. Haji of AITEC Resource Management Consultants,&#13;
Nairobi.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 2 of 3&#13;
initiatives these agencies have offered. Also, the Shifta wars of the 1960s, which lead to mass&#13;
displacement of nomads and loss of livestock, has been a contributing factor. Settlement is associated&#13;
with land degradation. Thus, the overall carrying capacity of the arid lands has been reduced, a&#13;
feature which has been exacerbated by neighboring wars and social conflicts.&#13;
4.    The distribution of livestock within ethnic groups is changing as a small elite own the&#13;
majority of animals and more and more families barely subsist. The availability of milk in the dry&#13;
season is the critical factor at household level; animals are increasingly sold to purchase grain (and&#13;
other cash needs), which undermines the possibility of herd expansion (and drought recovery).&#13;
Another trend is acute male labor shortages in the pastoral household due to school enrollment and&#13;
out-migration for urban jobs. These factors have led to a high number of female-headed households&#13;
and new roles for women. The trend is to diversify incomes through education and wage labor, or&#13;
other income-generating activities.&#13;
Impacts&#13;
5.    Overall, the ALRMP is not expected to have any negative impact on the social or physical&#13;
environment of the arid lands. None of the activities of the Drought Management Component,&#13;
which includes strengthening the country's institutional capacity for advanced drought preparedness,&#13;
for monitoring and predicting droughts, and for mitigating their impact by timely and effective&#13;
responses and coordination of post-drought recovery activities, is expected to have direct negative&#13;
impacts on the environment. Because road rehabilitation and development of drought mitigation&#13;
centers will be confined to existing infrastructure, no negatives impacts are envisioned.&#13;
6.    Some of the activities under the Livestock Marketing Component could have a degree of&#13;
negative impact on the environment, but overall the positive impacts of these activities outweigh any&#13;
negative ones. Negative impacts could result from increased numbers of livestock along revised&#13;
stocicroutes, and settlement around holding grounds and service facilities such as auction yards and&#13;
watering points. However, with community-based planned access and appropriate range management&#13;
practices this minimal impact could be eliminated. The development of stockroutes will help increase&#13;
offtake and ease pressure on grazing.&#13;
7.    On the whole the Community Development Component is expected to have either positive&#13;
or neutral environmental impact. Training activities would have a positive impact, as would the&#13;
establishment of fuel woodlots near urban centers, and the pilot testing of technological packages. As&#13;
long as water schemes are small in scale, no environmental impacts are envisioned. Income&#13;
generating activities to diversify the pastoral economy would have a positive impact, so long as the&#13;
new activities do not reduce the viability of primary pastoral activities. It is recommended that&#13;
certain CD activities should give deliberate attention to women, children and youths, so that they&#13;
might be sensitized to equitable and sustainable development.&#13;
8.    In order to enhance the positive impacts of the ALRMP, it is suggested that large water&#13;
sources not be developed unless complete environmental impact studies of each sub-project is&#13;
conducted. The possibility of increased numbers of livestock along stockroutes and the network water&#13;
points should be monitored closely so that trends can be established. Finally, a situation analysis&#13;
identifying the roles and status of women at the household and community levels is recommended.&#13;
&#13;

9.     Monitoring and evaluation of the environmental impact of the ALRMP should be a continuous&#13;
process and it is recommended that data collection and analysis occur at every level of&#13;
implementation. Some of the parameters and indicators of environmental effects include: rate of&#13;
increase of livestock numbers and human population around water points, trends in soil erosion,&#13;
grazing around water points, sedentarization trends, sales of livestock, changes in pastoralists'&#13;
lifestyles, changes in household income, etc. A multi-disciplinary monitoring network should be&#13;
established involving all the relevant actors in the arid lands.&#13;

ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
1.    The main quantifiable as well as non-monetizeable benefits accruing from the&#13;
implementation of the various project components have been described at some length in&#13;
paras. 5.5 through 5.15 , of the SAR. The basic cost/ benefit analysis undertaken indicates&#13;
that, even with modest assumptions about the quantifiable project benefits, the potential&#13;
returns from ALRMP will be fairly substantial. In view of the impact of the recent price&#13;
reforms in Kenya, the key distortions in the foreign exchange rate, interest rates, wage&#13;
rates and product prices have been removed. Thus, economic prices are expected to be&#13;
very close to financial prices. A project life of 20 years is assumed for purposes of benefit-&#13;
cost streams assessment. All transfers to GOK have been excluded from project benefits &amp;&#13;
costs; realistically, the fiscal impact of project benefits is expected to be negligible, due to&#13;
the informal nature of the livestock and labor markets in the ALs. Hence, taxes and&#13;
duties were excluded from the economic analysis. Also, price contingencies were not&#13;
reflected in project costs, since the project benefits were evaluated in constant terms, over&#13;
the project life.&#13;
2.    The analysis assumes that the main benefits resulting from  the Drought&#13;
Manazement Component of the project would stem from a reduction in livestock mortality&#13;
rates by about 25 percent, i.e., the herd losses due to drought (direct losses due to&#13;
starvation and disease/pestilence or indirect losses due to heightened slaughter rates)&#13;
would be reduced by one-quarter of the present high levels. On the basis of past trends, it&#13;
is also assumed that a severe drought is experienced every 10 years, while a less severe&#13;
one is experienced every 5 years. Hence, the 20 year project period would witness savings&#13;
related to four droughts of differing severities. The provision of animal health services&#13;
under the Marketing and Infrastructure and CD components, as well as the emergency&#13;
veterinary campaigns during droughts, coupled with improvements in water supply and&#13;
nutrition, will contribute towards improved weight and low disease rate herds. The&#13;
premium for the improved quality livestock (along with the reduced transportation/&#13;
marketing costs) is expected to translate into a modest 10 percent price increment.&#13;
3.    It is very conservatively estimated that the improvements to the marketing&#13;
infrastructure/ facilities of the ALs described earlier, would increase annual sales of cattle&#13;
and small ruminants by 20 percent each over current rates, and that of camels by just 10&#13;
percent p.a., at full development. However, sales volumes (off-take rates) are estimated to&#13;
drop to 50 percent of their normal levels in severe droughts and by an average of 35 percent&#13;
during the two subsequent years (following a severe drought year), while herd sizes build back&#13;
to their original levels. Drastically reduced prices (on the basis of prices prevailing during the&#13;
severe drought of 1991/92) have been applied during severe droughts, for purposes of&#13;
valuing the livestock. Given the substantial drought mitigation/management efforts under&#13;
the project, it is assumed that the prices during the less severe droughts will stabilize at&#13;
around fifty percent of the normal farmgate price levels. The benefits from incremental&#13;
livestock sales under the project are calculated by applying the increases in off-take rates to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

average herd sizes at the improved (with project) prices and by discounting for the drought&#13;
effect as above. The main quantifiable benefit from the CD component is expected to result&#13;
from a 10 percent improvement in the gross incomes of about 15 percent of the AL&#13;
populations who are expected to set up micro-enterprises with project support. Project&#13;
investment and recurrent costs related to each of the three components, were netted out&#13;
against the benefits streams. Project Support Unit costs were also included in the analysis.&#13;
Following project completion, recurrent costs were assumed to continue at levels&#13;
essential for sustaining an adequate flow of services related to the activities initiated under&#13;
the project. A one time replacement/rehabilitation expenditure in PY12, related to drought&#13;
management equipment/infrastructure (US$ 1.5 million), and for the rehabilitation/&#13;
construction of roads and replacement of construction and repair equipment (US$ 0.4 million)&#13;
was also included in the analysis.&#13;
4.    Based on the foregoing, an ERR of 16.9 percent is calculated for the project.&#13;
Results from switching value analysis for an ERR of 10 percent which is the Opportunity&#13;
Cost of Capital (OCC) for Kenya, demonstrate that a significant change in benefits or&#13;
costs, i.e. a 34 percent drop in total (quantifiable) benefits, or a large increase of 51&#13;
percent in costs would be required in order to reduce the ERR to 10 percent. Sensitivity&#13;
Analysis shows that if benefits fall or costs increase by 25 percent, the ERR would fall to&#13;
12 percent and 13.1 percent, respectively. Alternately, if benefits increase or costs fall by&#13;
25 percent, the ERR would rise to 21.3 percent and 22.6 percent, respectively. An&#13;
enormous decline of 70 percent in total benefits would be essential in order for the ERR to&#13;
drop to zero percent. Conversely, an exponential increase of 200 percent in total project costs&#13;
would push the ERR to zero percent. If all quantifiable benefits envisaged to accrue from the&#13;
drought mitigation/ management interventions under ALRMP are excluded from the total&#13;
benefits stream, the project's ERR would decline to 10.4 percent; if instead, the benefits&#13;
from the marketing and infrastructure improvements under the project are excluded, the&#13;
ERR drops to 5.3 percent. The exclusion of the CD benefits reduces the ERR to 14.4&#13;
percent. No independent lag analysis of the project's benefits stream was undertaken, as&#13;
the impact of droughts on the project's benefits stream was built into the basic economic&#13;
analysis model.&#13;

            Kenya - Arid Lands Resource Management Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Arid Lands Project
            are to strengthen and support community driven initiatives
            to: 1) reduce the widespread poverty and enhance food
            security in the arid districts of Turkana, Marsabit,
            Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, Tana River, Isiolo, Samburu, and
            the arid divisions of Baringo District; and 2) conserve the
            natural resource base in the arid lands (ALs) through: (a)
            improving crop and livestock resilience to drought; (b)
            increasing economic linkages with the rest of the economy;
            and (c) improving basic health services, water supply and
            other social services. The project will have the following
            components: 1) drought management, which includes
            preparedness (drought monitoring), mitigation (drought
            contingency planning and rapid reaction) and recovery
            (continued drought relief activities); 2) marketing and
            infrastructure, which will address the bottlenecks that
            impede livestock market linkages between the ALs and the
            rest of the national economy; and 3) economy development,
            which will be instrumental in assisting line ministries and
            collaborating agencies to adapt their organization and
            delivery systems to the specific conditions of the ALs.
