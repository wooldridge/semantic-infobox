            Risk management in customs : benefits of
            customs reform - the evidence from Albania
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Research into the economic impact of a
            customs reform in Albania shows the promise of the broader
            trade facilitation reform efforts that are gaining momentum
            in developing countries worldwide. The research summarized
            in this note finds that significantly reduced rates of
            physical inspection of import shipments in Albania reduced
            the length and variability of customs clearance times and
            increased import flows. Moreover, the reforms induced
            changes in the composition of trade and favored imports from
            preferential trading partners in the European Union.
