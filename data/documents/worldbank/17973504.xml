&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Today is February 5, 1987. My name is Charles Ziegler, and I am at the home of&#13;
Dr. Pieter Lieftinck. In his capacity as Minister of Finance of The Netherlands from 1945 until1952,&#13;
Dr. Lieftinck served as Governor for The Netherlands of the World Bank. In 1952, at the request of&#13;
World Bank President Eugene Black, Dr. Lieftinck took up the post of Special Representative of the&#13;
President of the World Bank in Turkey, in which capacity he served until1954. During the years 1954&#13;
and 1955 Dr. Lieftinck was successively Chief of the Economic Survey Missions to Syria and Jordan,&#13;
and he assisted in the establishment of a planning organization in Lebanon. On October 1, 1955,&#13;
Dr. Lieftinck began another distinguished career as Executive Director for Cyprus, Israel, The&#13;
Netherlands and Yugoslavia in the Bank and the International Monetary Fund. He retired from the&#13;
Bank's Board in 1974.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Dr. Lieftinck, you attended the inaugural meeting of the Boards of Governors of the Bank and&#13;
Fund in Savannah, Georgia, in March 1946. The substance of the meeting is well documented, but it&#13;
would be interesting to hear from you, a participant, something of the ambience, the fee~ if you will, of&#13;
that meeting--in particular, the relationship as you saw it between Lord [John Maynard] Keynes of the&#13;
United Kingdom and Mr. [Fred M.] Vinson, the U.S. Governor. I understand that the relations&#13;
between them were strained at times.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIEFTINCK: Well, Mr. Ziegler, my attendance at the Savannah inaugural meeting was most&#13;
interesting. To begin with, travel from The Netherlands to the United States was at that time far from&#13;
easy. I remember that I first had to fly by commercial plane to London; from there we crossed the&#13;
Atlantic in a Lancaster bomber, sitting in seats in the back of the plane. From New York to&#13;
Washington, and from Washington to Savannah, we traveled by train, because commercial flights were&#13;
infrequent, if they existed at all at that time.&#13;
&amp;#12;LIEFfiNCK                                         -2-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Was that a special train chartered for that conference?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIEFfiNCK: Yes, it was. The arrival in Savannah made a deep impression on me. The whole&#13;
population of the town of Savannah had come to welcome us, and the streets were lined with people&#13;
and children with little flags. The people gave us a very warm reception. The meeting itself brought&#13;
together all the fmance ministers of the original members and their central bank governors. It gave us&#13;
an opportunity to meet the founding fathers of the two institutions, the World Bank and the&#13;
International Monetary Fund, who had drafted the Articles of Agreement of the two organizations at&#13;
the Bretton Woods meeting in 1944.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Which, as I recall, you read about in a concentration camp.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIEFfiNCK: Indeed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    There was much substantive discussion about the organization and policies of the World Bank in&#13;
that meeting, but, in addition, meeting participants voiced their expectations--sometimes very&#13;
eloquently--of what the World Bank could perform and should perform. One of the outstanding&#13;
speeches was made by Lord Keynes, who warned the institutions, both the Bank and the Fund, not to&#13;
become political institutions but to remain businesslike in their operations. In the course of his speech&#13;
he raised his fmger and said, "Beware lest you should become politicians." His high standing in the&#13;
world of economics made him a dominant fJgUTe in that meeting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Of course, the American representative, Fred Vinson, also made a great impression, and we all&#13;
realized that the success of the two institutions would depend to a large extent on the active&#13;
contribution to be made by the United States.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I gather that Lord Keynes and Mr. Vinson didn't always get on too well. My&#13;
understanding from my readings is that there was a bit of disagreement, especially with regard to the&#13;
location of the Bank. The British would have preferred New York whereas the Americans were quite&#13;
adamant about Washington.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIEFfiNCK: That is true. The American felt that it was important that the Bank and Fund be&#13;
regarded as international institutions, not simply as Wall Street institutions. That could be best&#13;
accomplished by locating them in Washington, which is the international diplomatic center of the&#13;
United States, rather than in New York.&#13;
&amp;#12;LIEFTINCK                                            -3-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[LIEFTINCK)&#13;
     Along with the matter of location, the position of the Executive Directors was also in dispute. It&#13;
was the British view, and particularly the view of Lord Keynes, that the Executive Directors should not&#13;
exercise too dominant a role. Therefore, he was against the appointment of full-time Executive&#13;
Directors; instead, he felt that representatives of the respective countries should carry out the functions&#13;
of the Executive Directors from their capitals, coming to Headquarters in Washington to meet from&#13;
time to time. The American view was different. The Americans preferred full-time Executive&#13;
Directors stationed in Washington and giving their full time and activity to the work of the Bank and&#13;
Fund.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I have no recollection of the tension you mentioned between Lord Keynes and Mr. Vinson. If&#13;
there was tension, it was well in the background; in my recollection, the meeting was quite harmonious,&#13;
full of a spirit of cooperation and full of great expectations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Some ofthe earliest Bank operations were for post-war reconstruction loans in The&#13;
Netherlands, your home country. Of course, at that time the Bank was still new to the whole business&#13;
of making loans. I think the first loan to The Netherlands was something like loan number six, so it&#13;
was really a new concept. From your vantage point at that time as Minister of Finance of The&#13;
Netherlands, could you relate a little of the processes that were followed in negotiating these early&#13;
loans? I know the flies are quite voluminous, so I imagine a lot went on in preparing the loans for The&#13;
Netherlands.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIEFTINCK: Yes. The Netherlands originally approached the World Bank with the request for a&#13;
reconstruction loan via The Netherlands Permanent Mission in New York. The loan was to be used to&#13;
supply necessary goods that, at that time, could only be provided by the United States. At the end of&#13;
1946, this Mission had already opened discussions with the World Bank about the possibility of&#13;
providing The Netherlands with a reconstruction loan. The discussions did not lead to an early result.&#13;
Both sides made tentative moves to establish a basis for firm negotiations, but discussions lasted until&#13;
April1947, when I, as Finance Minister of The Netherlands, felt the urgent need to obtain a World&#13;
Bank loan because the lack of foreign exchange was causing us to run out of necessary supplies from&#13;
the United States. In 1946, during the Annual Meeting, I had negotiated a loan of $200 million with&#13;
the Export-Import Bank; this was a short-term loan, for only two years, to be repaid out of the&#13;
&amp;#12;UEFTINCK                                           -4-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[LIEFfiNCK]&#13;
proceeds of Dutch-held securities iu America. Fortunately, shortly after The Netherlands obtaiued the&#13;
World Bank loan, the term of that Export-Import Bank loan was extended. But iu April1947 that loan&#13;
had been fully utilized, and siuce there were few other sources to borrow from--we had to borrow the&#13;
dollars we needed for our imports--we felt that the only way to solve the problem was to approach the&#13;
World Bank with a more urgent request and try to conviuce them of the justification of a loan to The&#13;
Netherlands.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Therefore, I iuvited the Governor of the Central Bank of The Netherlands to go on a special&#13;
mission to Washiugton to speak directly with the President of the World Bank, then [John J.] McCloy,&#13;
and speed up the negotiations. The origiual program that he took along consisted mainly of projects&#13;
for the reconstruction and expansion of the productivity capacity of The Netherlands; the program also&#13;
covered imports needed by The Netherlands.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Were there not also loans for airlines and shippiug?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
UEFTINCK: Yes, I'll come to that. That belongs to the iucrease of productivity capacity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    After reviewiug the Bank's Articles of Agreement, The Netherlands had assumed that the Bank&#13;
wonld be williug to lend funds only for specific projects to spur productivity and The Netherlands had&#13;
deliberately omitted from its program items like raw materials and goods that were not directly related&#13;
to projects. However, after the staff of the Bank examined the program, they iudicated that iu this&#13;
case, as iu a few earlier cases that had come before the Bank, the Bank wonld be williug to iuclude raw&#13;
materials and make the loan available for broader general reconstruction and development purposes.&#13;
In effect, the loan conld better be defiued as a general purpose loan, rather than strictly a project loan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The Netherlands negotiators welcomed this approach by the Bank. They immediately set to work&#13;
revisiug the program. They expanded it, redrafted it and submitted a completely new program with&#13;
less emphasis on specific projects. The Bank was receptive to the new program, and it became the&#13;
basis for the substance of the loan agreement.&#13;
&amp;#12;LIEFfiNCK                                          -5-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[LIEFfiNCK]&#13;
     One of the subjects that needed some clarification before the fmal agreement was reached was&#13;
whether early repayment of the Export-Import Bank loan would jeopardize the negotiation of the&#13;
usual execution and contribution of the World Bank loan. In order to resolve this, the Management of&#13;
the Bank--in this case Mr. [Robert L.] Garner, the Vice President, and Mr. [Stanley] Hoar, the&#13;
Director for Western Europe, contacted Mr. [William McChesney] Martin the Chairman of the Board&#13;
of the Export-Import Bank; although this did not result in a ftrm commitment, Mr. Martin indicated&#13;
that he was strongly inclined to agree to an extension of the Export-Import Bank loan. This extension,&#13;
in fact, did occur, but not until after the new negotiations with the World Bank had come to an end.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The loan obtained by The Netherlands from the World Bank was a long-term loan for 30 years at&#13;
an interest rate of 3.25 percent, if I'm not mistaken, with 1 percent commission and with an&#13;
amortization schedule that would start amortizations only after a few years. This became a matter of&#13;
negotiation. The Netherlands insisted on a grace period for repayment of ftve years while the Bank&#13;
originally had a shorter period in mind. But fmally a grace period of ftve years was accepted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    This World Bank loan in the amount of $195 million covered the dollar import needs of The&#13;
Netherlands for no more than one year, the year 1947. After some original objection, the World Bank&#13;
agreed that its loan could be used retroactively for imports as of the beginning of 1947. The&#13;
Netherlands had submitted a request for a loan of over $500 million also covering the year 1948 and&#13;
part of 1949, but the Bank preferred to restrict its assistance to ftnancing the 1947 needs as a form of&#13;
ftrst tranche. The Bank made it clear that any additional loans to The Netherlands would be made only&#13;
after reviewing the use of the ftrst tranche and assessing its economic effects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    In 1948 The Netherlands again experienced a pressing need for dollar ftnancing, but we did not ask&#13;
for a second tranche and, instead, temporarily solved our problem by requisitioning dollar assets in the&#13;
United States. At that time, discussions were underway in the United States about what later became&#13;
known as the Marshall Plan. Expectations in Western Europe and in The Netherlands were that these&#13;
discussions would come to an early conclusion; that was the main reason that The Netherlands did not&#13;
approach the World Bank again, but rather tried to manage on its own until the Marshall Plan help&#13;
would materialize.&#13;
&amp;#12;UEFITNCK                                           -6-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What were the long-term effects of the Bank's loans to The Netherlands? Did they&#13;
provide substantive help for The Netherlands' reconstruction after the Second World War?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIEFITNCK: The loans did make a very substantial contribution. Today, $200 million dollars does&#13;
not sound like it would go very far toward the reconstruction of a thoroughly devastated country, but as&#13;
a proportion of the total requirements of foreign exchange assistance over one year, it was very&#13;
important and had a significant effect on the reconstruction of the Dutch economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You were the Special Representative of the President of the World Bank in Turkey&#13;
between mid-1952 and 1955. Could you relate why Mr. Black felt that he needed a Special&#13;
Representative in Turkey?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIEFI'INCK: Yes. In 1952 the Bank had a number of problems with Turkey whose resolution would&#13;
require a special effort. In the preceding period the Bank had made a number of loans to Turkey for&#13;
grain silos, for port development and some other special projects. The Bank was anxious to ensure that&#13;
these projects were properly executed, but because of slowness on the Turkish side, practically no&#13;
disbursements had been made. The Bank felt that the money set aside for these Turkish projects&#13;
remained substantially unutilized. So one of the purposes of my mission to Turkey was to help the&#13;
Turkish authorities speed up utilization of these loans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Another problem was that Turkey was in default on repayment of loans Britain had made to&#13;
Turkey during the war years. The Bank's general policy was to require borrowers to meet external&#13;
obligations. So, the Bank wanted me to encourage the Turkish authorities to fulfill their obligations&#13;
towards Great Britain, or, at least, to enter into negotiations with the British Government for&#13;
rescheduling or reducing these obligations. It was a very sensitive problem; in my initial discussions,&#13;
the President of Turkey, Mr. [Celal] Bayar, and his Prime Minister [Adnan Menderes], indicated rather&#13;
bluntly that they would not accept any interference by the World Bank in this matter. They even&#13;
disputed that the British had a legitimate claim. Nevertheless, by establishing good personal relations&#13;
with Turkey's Finance Minister, Hasan Polatkan, and impressing on him how important was Turkish&#13;
access to the World Bank for additional loans, I succeeded in obtaining his support. He, in turn,&#13;
engaged in tactful negotiations with the British via the British Ambassador in Ankara. I also&#13;
&amp;#12;LIEFTINCK                                          -7-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(LIEFI1NCK]&#13;
established friendly relations with the British Ambassador, and through these contacts and through&#13;
persuasion, Turkey and the British Government reached an agreement. This outcome was most&#13;
welcome to the World Bank, and one of the Bank's high officials later told me that this result, in itself,&#13;
had justified my mission to Turkey.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Besides these two problems relating specifically to the relations between the Bank and Turkey, the&#13;
Bank also wanted me to address a third subject: the Turkish Government's economic and financial&#13;
policies. In the view of the Bank, these policies needed to be substantially improved in order to speed&#13;
up the economic development of the country under stable conditions. The World Bank expected me to&#13;
help the Turkish Government improve their economic and fmancial policies by giving them&#13;
encouragement and advice. This was a very difficult task, since the Turks were highly sensitive about&#13;
the matter and unwilling to listen to an outsider's advice. The only way I could exercise some influence&#13;
was through intensive contacts with high officials in the administration who had strategic positions in&#13;
the Government's policy-making apparatus. But this was a longer-term proposition, and,&#13;
unfortunately, my stay in Turkey was terminated before much visible effect was reached.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: On what basis was it terminated? Did the Bank terminate it or did the Turks?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIEFI1NCK: No time limit to my assignment in Turkey had been set. However, it carne to an end&#13;
rather abruptly as the result of an incident that happened in 1955. In that year, President Bayar had&#13;
been on an official visit to the United States, and at my suggestion, the President of he World Bank&#13;
(Eugene Black] had invited him for a luncheon in the Bank. The luncheon was also attended by the&#13;
American Ambassador to Turkey, who had accompanied President Bayar on his trip. Among the&#13;
speeches made at that luncheon was one by the U.S. Ambassador, who took this opportunity to tell&#13;
Mr. Black that the World Bank had done much too little to help Turkey by way of loans. This untactful&#13;
intervention by the Ambassador infuriated Mr. Black and Mr. Garner, the Vice President. After the&#13;
luncheon, Mr. Garner approached the Turkish President and made some rather blunt comments to&#13;
him about Turkey's economic and fmancial policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Garner could be pretty blunt, too.&#13;
&amp;#12;LIEFfiNCK                                            -8-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIEFfiNCK: Yes. This incident had consequences for two people: for the American Ambassador to&#13;
Turkey and for me. Mr. Black used his influence with the State Department to get the American&#13;
Ambassador to Turkey replaced. At the same time, the Turkish authorities understood quite weD that&#13;
my reports to Headquarters had given the Bank its picture of how the Turkish Government managed&#13;
its economic and fmancial affairs. Shortly after his return to Turkey, the President notified the Bank&#13;
that they saw nothing more to be gained from my staying in Turkey. For a number of years this made&#13;
it practicaUy impossible for the World Bank to be active in Turkey. There was a long, cool period in&#13;
that relationship, but, fortunately, the strain eased in later years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    At the time when the Turkish Government notified the Bank and the Bank decided to recaU me, I&#13;
was in Jordan heading a general economic survey mission that the Bank had sent to that country. I&#13;
interrupted my visit to Jordan and traveled back to Ankara to liquidate the World Bank office there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Dr. Lieftinck, there was a story about the Turkish Development Bank and the&#13;
appointment of the Managing Director. Could you relate that story, please?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIEFfiNCK: Yes. One day the World Bank requested my opinion on a candidate that the Turkish&#13;
Government favored for the position of Managing Director of the new Industrial Development Bank.&#13;
Not knowing the person in question, I went to see the Dean of the economics faculty at Robert CoUege&#13;
where most of the Turkish economists had received their academic training. He was a distinguished&#13;
person with an intimate knowledge of his country and of the economic world. He was a lawyer, and in&#13;
addition to his academic position, he served as a legal advisor to Standard Oil in Turkey. I had made it&#13;
clear to him that the candidate needed to be not only a good, conscientious economist and banker, but&#13;
that he also had to be skiUed in public relations, because new banking institutions had to advertise&#13;
themselves in Turkey, so to speak.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    So I asked him about the candidate, and his reply was, "WeD, Mr. Lieftinck, I do not like to&#13;
comment on people, but let me teD you a story." He went on to teD me that years ago the Sultan had&#13;
had a dream in which he dreamed that all of his teeth feU out. The next morning he ordered his First&#13;
Magician to explain the dream. The First Magician said, "Your Majesty, I'm the most wretched man in&#13;
your country, because I have to teD you that your dream means that you wiU lose all your wives&#13;
&amp;#12;UEFTINCK                                           -9-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[LIEFTINCK]&#13;
and children and remain an old and solitary man.' The Sultan became furious and ordered his sword&#13;
bearer to cut off the First Magician's head. Then he called in his Second Magician, told him his dream&#13;
and ordered him to explain it. The Second Magician said, "Your Majesty, I'm the most fortunate man&#13;
in your realm, because your dream means that you will survive all of your wives and children and have&#13;
a happy old age." The Sultan was so pleased that he ordered his treasurer to give the Second Magician&#13;
his weight in gold. "Well," the Dean said, "the candidate is more of the first kind of magician."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That's a very good story.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
UEFTINCK: Shortly thereafter, the Bank requested my opinion of a man the Turkish Government&#13;
was proposing as the Chairman of the Board of a new institution. Again I went to see the Dean in&#13;
Istanbul and asked his opinion. Again he said, 'I don't like to comment on people, but let me tell you a&#13;
story." He said, "Some years ago I was invited by a friend to spend a long weekend in his township. On&#13;
Friday morning we went to the mosque, and I noticed that the imam who recites the prayers and sits in&#13;
front of the congregation was a rather undistinguished man. After the service I said to my host, 'Tell&#13;
me: Usually the imam is a distinguished person. How did it happen that such a man was made imam&#13;
of your mosque?' My host answered, 'Well, this particular man used to be the guardian of our shoes,&#13;
which we take off before entering the mosque, but many times when we came back out of the mosque,&#13;
we couldn't fmd our shoes anymore. So we made him the imam who sits in front and not behind us.'&#13;
The Dean added, 'I am afraid that the candidate for Chairman of the Board is that kind of imam." So I&#13;
made my report to Washington.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And with the appropriate results, presumably.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIEFTINCK: Well, in fact, both men were appointed. The Bank felt that it should only object in very&#13;
exceptional cases. But they gave them a warning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: As to what to expect perhaps, yes. After your service in Turkey, Dr. Lieftinck, you&#13;
became the chief of two general survey missions. One to Syria...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
UEFTINCK: Syria and one to Jordan.&#13;
&amp;#12;LIEFTINCK                                         -10-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIEFTINCK: These were fascinating assignments. It was not the first time that the World Bank had&#13;
sent such a mission to a member country, particularly a developing country, before it started lending&#13;
activities in that country. So the Bank already had some experience in this respect. But for me it was a&#13;
new assignment and very worthwhile.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 These missions consisted of some eight to ten people--economists, specialized engineers and usually a&#13;
tax expert. The chief of mission was assigned to guide that team and to establish good relations with&#13;
and obtain the cooperation of the government of the country involved. The task of the mission was to&#13;
provide as accurate a description of the economy as possible as a basis for determining development&#13;
priorities. In particular, the mission was charged with identifying priority projects to which the&#13;
development of the country's resources should be directed, establishing the country's own capacity to&#13;
contribute fmancially to its development program, determining how much foreign assistance would be&#13;
required and making an official list of projects that might qualify for World Bank fmancing. The&#13;
mission, therefore, not only spent its time--which usually was three to four months--conducting&#13;
research in the capital and collecting whatever information was available there, but it also made&#13;
extensive trips throughout the country surveying the general level of education and studying the&#13;
availability of institutions and of physical resources and establishing the most promising development of&#13;
these resources. Along with being enjoyable, these field trips were very instructive and contributed a&#13;
great deal of knowledge to the mission and to the Bank about the country's economic potential. The&#13;
cooperation among the members of the mission was excellent, and I enjoyed the relations I established&#13;
with the central government, local authorities and the common people working in agriculture and&#13;
manufacturing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    After its return to Headquarters, the mission undertook the arduous task of writing its report. The&#13;
chief of mission provided the necessary coordination and selected the material to be discussed in the&#13;
report and in its recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The mission to Syria met with a particular problem, because during its stay there, a revolution took&#13;
place and, for some time, the country was divided into two parts: a revolutionary north and a more&#13;
loyal south. But revolutions in Syria were not very bloody, and during the conflict we managed to pass&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
[LIEFTINCK]&#13;
through the front line between the north and the south from Damascus to Aleppo using a laissez passer&#13;
that was honored by both parties. I remember we had made an appointment with the Mayor of&#13;
Aleppo, but when we arrived, we found that the loyal Government troops had put him in jail.&#13;
However, this did not seriously affect our work on that trip.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    After completion of the work in Syria, I was invited by the Bank to head another mission, this one&#13;
to Jordan. The membership of that mission was different from the one that had served me in Syria, but&#13;
was again of high quality. Here again, we spent part of our time in Amman, the capital, and part of our&#13;
time visiting various parts of the country. We had an experience comparable to our Syrian mission in&#13;
terms of in our relations with the authorities, but this mission was carried out under peaceful&#13;
conditions. The young King Hussein, the same one who is still in power, took a keen personal interest&#13;
in the work of the mission; this proved to be very helpful in obtaining the cooperation of the&#13;
authorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Both reports after their completion were published in a series of monographs published by...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I think it was the Johns Hopkins University Press for the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIEFTINCK: Yes. These monographs have, for a number of years, served as the basis for activities in&#13;
these countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    My last assignment in the Middle East was to advise the Lebanese Government on its&#13;
development planning and on the establishment of a development bank. At that time Lebanon was a&#13;
wonderful and relatively prosperous country where peaceful relations still prevailed between Moslems&#13;
and Christians. As was the rule, its President was a Maronite, which is a Christian denomination&#13;
closely related to Roman Catholicism, and the Prime Minister was a Moslem. Again, both of them&#13;
took a keen interest in my activities and were helpful in every possible respect.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Before I assumed that job in Lebanon and while I was still working in Ankara, I had received a&#13;
request from Washington to go to Beirut to do some research in preparation for a visit that Mr. Black&#13;
intended to make to the country. I decided to drive there in my own car and took my British secretary,&#13;
&amp;#12;LIEFfiNCK                                          -12-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[LIEFTINCK)&#13;
who was assigned to me in Turkey with me. It was a two-day trip by car. The first day we went as far&#13;
as Antalya, and the second day we drove through the Anti-Taurus Mountains, which stretch from north&#13;
to south through southern Turkey and northern Syria. This was a practically uninhabited area, and we&#13;
drove a winding mountainous road.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        All of a sudden, around a bend, we encountered a group of some 20 young Turkish men in the&#13;
middle of the road. They were apparently in a joyful mood, kind of dancing around a man blowing a&#13;
trumpet. I gave a signal. They didn't move and formed a phalanx blocking the road. I had to stop in&#13;
front of them. Immediately two of them jumped on my front fenders and a tall chap, apparently their&#13;
leader, pulled open the right-hand door of the car, showed his revolver and ordered my secretary to&#13;
alight. It was not hard to imagine what he had in mind and what would have happened to the young&#13;
lady.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Fortunately, the Swiss Ambassador in Ankara, who was fond of hunting, had warned me to take a&#13;
weapon whenever making trips through the countryside because these people did not like foreigners in&#13;
their territory and they were known to attack. In fact, this happened frequently and was reported in the&#13;
papers. So I had gone to the Chief of Police in Ankara and asked for a license to carry a revolver. I&#13;
received permission and bought one. So when that chap pulled open the door of the car, I pulled my&#13;
revolver out of my belt, and stuck my hand in front of my secretary under his nose. Not expecting such&#13;
a thing, he shrank back and let go of the door to which my secretary was still hanging. I gave full gas.&#13;
The engine roared. The chaps sitting on the fenders got scared and jumped off. The road in front of&#13;
me was free. I geared in and drove off as quickly as possible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That's quite a scary story. I hadn't heard that one before.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIEFfiNCK: After a little while I turned to my secretary, who was crying, and I said to her, "Dear,&#13;
don't worry. Nothing has happened." And she replied, "I'll show you what happened." Hanging at the&#13;
door she had given counter-pressure with her left hand in the panel of the door, and when the door&#13;
slammed, her thumb was crushed, so she was in terrible pain. Fortunately, I had aspirin and cognac&#13;
with me and gave her that liberally but it took three hours before we reached Latakia in the north of&#13;
Syria. I took her to a hospital, and she was taken care of. It gives you a little picture of conditions.&#13;
&amp;#12;LIEFTINCK                                          -13-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Indeed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    If we could turn perhaps to your years on the Board. You were a distinguished member of the&#13;
Board of Executive Directors of the World Bank for some 19 years, which as I recall ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIEFTINCK: Seventeen.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: ...is a record except for Dr. [Luis] Machado, who was slightly senior to you, I believe.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIEFTINCK: He was my senior, but when he retired, I became Dean of the Board. Well, in the&#13;
Board I had to represent the views of five countries; not originally, but it became five countries: The&#13;
Netherlands, Yugoslavia,   Israe~   Cyprus and Romania. The four last mentioned were active clients of&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Representing five countries, each with its different approaches and needs, was not too difficult,&#13;
mainly because The Netherlands' Government understood that the Executive Director could not serve&#13;
only his own country. They allowed their Executive Director more independence than that enjoyed by&#13;
an Executive Director representing only one big country, and who could be under almost daily&#13;
instructions of his government. To a very large extent, I could operate in the Board according to my&#13;
own views and opinions, and only in exceptional cases, when a direct Dutch interest was involved, did I&#13;
receive instructions from The Hague.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I remember only one case in which there was a conflict of interest between two of the countries I&#13;
represented, namely Israel and The Netherlands. This conflict arose when Egypt applied for a Bank&#13;
loan for the enlargement of the Suez Can~ and the Israeli authorities requested me to oppose that&#13;
loan because Egypt had blocked access to the Canal for Israeli ships. However, because The&#13;
Netherlands was rather prominent in shipping it was in favor of the project and asked me to support it.&#13;
When the proposal for that loan to Egypt came before the Bollfd. I made a speech in which I indicated&#13;
that Israel was opposed to it but that, in view of the interests of my other constituencies, I had decided&#13;
to support it. So the Israeli point of view was made and the Israelis understood my position.&#13;
&amp;#12;LIEFilNCK                                         -14-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Did you fmd that such conflicts of interest were relatively rare among your colleagues, as&#13;
well, during the time that you were on the Board? For instance, you say you experienced only one such&#13;
conflict. But how about other Executive Directors, some of whom represented an even greater number&#13;
of countries? Did you fmd that they were usually homogenous, or that sometimes there were these&#13;
conflicts?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIEFilNCK: As far as I know, Executive Directors representing more than their own country, some&#13;
of them representing more than ten, never experienced any serious conflicts of interest. Usually they&#13;
spoke with one voice on behalf of their whole constituency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And, presumably, if there were a conflict they wonld have acted much as you did.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIEFilNCK: Yes, yes, yes. In the Board meetings I often participated not only in discussions of the&#13;
policy and administrative subjects on the agenda, but I also--and perhaps more than most other&#13;
Executive Directors--took a keen interest in individual projects. My experience in developing countries&#13;
and particnlarly, of course, in those to which I had been assigned, enabled me to make inquiries and&#13;
often to express an opinion on development projects that came up for decision. I thoroughly studied&#13;
the reports submitted by the staff and usually came to the Board meetings well prepared and interested&#13;
in the borrowing country and in specific projects to be financed. And although my questions were not&#13;
always easy for the staff to address, it was my practice, at least a day before the meeting, to inform the&#13;
appropriate staff member of my intention to raise a special point. The staff appreciated this approach,&#13;
and it avoided the possibility that they might be embarrassed by not having a ready reply.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I also took a keen interest in administrative questions that had to be decided by the Board, such as&#13;
salaries and fringe benefits. Having had to deal with such problems in my own country and having&#13;
been on the Bank's staff for a few years, I tried to contribute as much as possible to improving the&#13;
working conditions for the Bank staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Which, I can assure you, is profoundly appreciated by the staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIEFilNCK: Yes. I also took a very keen interest, first, in the establishment and, later, in the&#13;
operations of IDA [International Development Association] and the Economic Development Institute.&#13;
&amp;#12;LIEFTINCK                                         -15-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[LIEFTINCK)&#13;
I considered these very important extensions of the Bank. I occupied myself not only with Bank&#13;
lending but also with Bank borrowing in the international capital market and with the spread between&#13;
lending and borrowing rates. The financial integrity of the Bank, its earning capacity--which should&#13;
allow a sufficient reserve buildup--had my full interest. I was also concerned with the scope of Bank&#13;
operations and the size of the Bank's staff. This became rather significant particularly under the&#13;
presidency of Mr. [Robert] McNamara. Whereas Mr. Black and Mr. Woods had been rather&#13;
conservative in these matters, Mr. McNamara was much more inclined to widen the field of Bank&#13;
activities and to rapidly increase the Bank staff. I was rather conservative in these matters and afraid&#13;
that the Bank would expand too much and too rapidly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Do you think it did, in retrospect?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIEFTINCK: Oh, yes, definitely. Definitely. We had taken an opposition position and often made it&#13;
clear in the Board that caution should be observed in these matters. But Mr. McNamara's drive was&#13;
strong, and most of the other members of the Board eventually accepted his expansionist policies, so&#13;
my outspoken approach had little effect.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That is pretty much what I had in mind to do today. I think we've done a good job. I&#13;
would like to thank you very much for being so generous with you time.&#13;
