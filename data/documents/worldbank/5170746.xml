&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I.BACKGROUNDTOTHEEARTHQUAKE&#13;
&#13;
1. Bam.Bam is a historical oasis city located inKerman Province inthe southeastern part o fthe&#13;
   country.   In 2003, the population of Bam District (consisting of Bam City, neighboring&#13;
   Baravat and Arg-e-Jadid towns and 900 surrounding villages) was equal to 200,000 while the&#13;
   population o f the city o f Bam alone numbered around 92,000 inhabitants.           Bam i s an&#13;
   important part o f Iran's history and i s internationally renown for its quality dates and rich&#13;
   cultural heritage. This includes the 2500-year old Arg-e-Bam citadel considered among the&#13;
   largest earthen structures inthe world.&#13;
&#13;
2. December 26, 2003 Earthquake. A major earthquake registering 6.5 on the &amp;chter scale&#13;
   devastated the Bam District on December 26, 2003. Latest estimates indicate that more than&#13;
   26,000 people were killed, 30,000 injured and up to 75,600 left homeless. A substantial&#13;
   number o f professional and managerial staff fi-om local civil service has also perished, thus&#13;
   makingit a human resource tragedy for the local governance.&#13;
&#13;
3. Government Emergency Response in the Aftermath of the Earthquake. Search and&#13;
   rescue efforts were immediately mobilized by the Government o f Iran (GOI), through the&#13;
   National Committee for Reduction o f Natural Disasters' Impacts (NCRNDI) under the&#13;
   Ministry o f Interior (MOI) and the Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS).             The latter&#13;
   mobilized more than 8,500 relief workers and volunteers and launched large-scale rescue,&#13;
   evacuation and relief operations. The affected District was divided into fourteen zones, and&#13;
   relief and humanitarian assistance in each zone was assigned to a Provincial Government in&#13;
   the country.&#13;
&#13;
4. Donor Support for RescueandReliefOperations. International agencies and more than 44&#13;
   countries have contributed to the rescue and relief operation. Both United Nations agencies&#13;
   and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have been in the field since the&#13;
   aftermath of the earthquake to support the Government in the immediate socio-economic&#13;
   concerns. In February 2004, and at the request o f the GOI, the International Bank for&#13;
   Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) carried out also a damage assessment mission to&#13;
   Iran.&#13;
&#13;
5. Damage incurred by the Earthquake.The earthquake destroyed 85% o f the buildings and&#13;
   severely affected infrastructure networks. The rich cultural heritage o f Bam, including Arg-e-&#13;
   Bam and 26 other cultural heritage sites suffered significant damage. The "Qanats"&#13;
   (traditional underground imgation systems) that were vital to the dates production`sustained&#13;
   severe damages. Preliminary figures o f damage were estimated to be equal to US$1.5 billion&#13;
   (direct damage: US$1.2billion, indirect damage: US$0.3 billion).&#13;
&#13;
6. Disaster Management Capacity in Iran. Iran i s known to be one o f the most earthquake&#13;
  prone countries inthe world. With two major seismic belts, the entire country faces moderate&#13;
   to very high seismic risks. One runs along the Zagros Mountains in southem Iran, along the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Persian Gulf, while the other runs through northern Iran around the Caspian Sea. Inthe 20'&#13;
    century alone, twenty large earthquakes have claimed more than 140,000 lives, destroyed&#13;
   many villages and cities, and caused extensive economic damage to the country. Serious&#13;
   attention to emergency response and disaster management emerged after the 1990&#13;
   RashdGilan earthquake. In 1991, the Consultative Assembly assigned formal responsibilities&#13;
    for natural disasters management to the Ministry o f the Interior, which up to that time, were&#13;
   discharged by a special task force within the Office o fthe President.&#13;
&#13;
   While the country's emergency response capacity has improved considerably, it remains&#13;
    insufficient should a major earthquake or a natural disaster occur in a large urban area, like&#13;
   Tehran. Better inter-agency coordination on all aspects (research, training and application)&#13;
   and all stages o f disaster management (prevention, relief, reconstruction) i s needed to enable&#13;
    smoother transition from relief to reconstruction, and to better prepare for future potential&#13;
   disasters.   Over the next five years, the UN system in Iran envisions to support the&#13;
   Government in developing and mainstreaming appropriate risk-reduction policies and&#13;
   practices beyond Bam to reduce the possibility o f similar catastrophes invulnerable cities.&#13;
&#13;
   While the major focus remains on the physical reconstruction, the proposed project will&#13;
    address the emergency preparedness o f the Kerman Province. Broader capacity building&#13;
    activities will be implemented under the on-going Emergency Earthquake Recovery Project&#13;
    (EERP, Loan 4697-IRN) that aims at medium-to-long term strengthening the country's&#13;
   disaster management system.&#13;
&#13;
    Special institutional set-up for the reconstruction of Bam. While relief efforts were&#13;
   coordinated through the MOIbased on the above structure, the Govemment created the Bam&#13;
   Guidance and Policy Task Force (BGPTF) that i s charged with issuingpolicy guidelines, as&#13;
    well as planning and supervising the reconstruction efforts. This Task Force comprises the&#13;
   Minister o f Housing and Urban Development (Chairman), the head o f the Management and&#13;
   Planning Organization (MPO), three representatives o f the president, the Minister o f Interior,&#13;
   the Minister o f Economic Affairs and Finance, the Minister o f Culture and Islamic Guidance,&#13;
   the president o f the Iranian Red Crescent Society, the president o f the Housing Foundation o f&#13;
    the Islamic Revolution and the Kerman Governor-General.&#13;
&#13;
10. Three subcommittees were created. These include: (i) Internal Aid Committee; (ii)&#13;
                                                             the                                the&#13;
   InternationalAid Committee; and (iii)    the Reconstruction Planning Committee. The first two&#13;
    committees are headed by the Minister o f Economic Affairs and Finance, whereas, the third&#13;
    committee i s chaired by the Head o f the Housing Foundation and acts as the executive arm o f&#13;
   the Task Force. At the local level, the "Bam Provincial Reconstruction Task Force" was&#13;
    formed and i s composed of the Governor-General (Chairman), the head o f the province's&#13;
    MPO office, the head o f the province's Housing and Urban Development Organization, the&#13;
    Managing Director o f the province's Housing Foundation (HF), the Head o f the province's&#13;
   Economic Affairs and Finance Organization, the Managing Director o f the Cultural Heritage&#13;
    Organization o f the province, Bam's Govemor, Bam's Mayor and the Head o f Bam's Islamic&#13;
    City Council.    Identification, preparation and implementation o f the reconstruction works&#13;
   was carried out by the sectors and utilities concerned under the coordination o f the above&#13;
   Task Force.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                               3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11.IBRD'SRESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
11. The IBRD has significant global and country-specific experience inpost-disaster emergency&#13;
    reconstruction. Over the past two decades, the IBRD's financing for post-disaster recovery&#13;
    projects amounts to US$40 billion and has accumulated a strong knowledge base to promote&#13;
    strategic approaches to disaster risk and the integration o f disaster risk management into the&#13;
    development process. In Iran, between 1992 and 2002, three reconstruction projects were&#13;
    prepared with a total lending value equal to US$487 million'. The projects covered both&#13;
    reconstruction investments and technical assistance programs aimed at improving disaster&#13;
    management capacity o f the Government.&#13;
&#13;
12. Lessons from previous IBRD involvement. The main lesson learned from recent&#13;
    emergency lending operations by the IBRD i s that the project objectives should be realistic&#13;
    and focused on achieving rapid resumption o f economic and social activities. Projects that&#13;
    have successfully achieved their objectives had simple design, relied on already existing&#13;
    institutions and were not burdened with macro-conditionality. Furthermore, considering that&#13;
    emergency projects are prepared on an accelerated schedule, rigorous independent auditing&#13;
    and evolving monitoring and evaluation systems are to be plannedand budgeted for.&#13;
&#13;
13. The design o f the project incorporates lessons drawn from past and on-going IBRD-financed&#13;
    emergency projects in Iran. They are: Sistan River Flood Works Rehabilitation Project&#13;
    (LN3478-JRN, October 1992 - June 2000, US$57 million), the Earthquake Emergency&#13;
    Response Project (LN3301-IRN, March 1991 - June 1996, US$250 million) and the on-&#13;
    going Earthquake Emergency Recovery Project (EERF', LN 4697-IRN, US$180 million).&#13;
    The first two projects were rated satisfactory by OED. Disbursements were slower than&#13;
    expected due to implementationsdelays, and the loans closed 2 to 3 years beyond the original&#13;
    schedule.        The on-going EERP has accumulated delays o f about 6 months. Key lessons&#13;
    learned &amp;om previous projects were integrated into the design o f the this project and are&#13;
    summarized inTable-1.It i s also expected that, with the opening o f the Bank liaison office in&#13;
    Tehran in FY05, and the recruitment o f a local fiduciary team, implementation issues will be&#13;
    further addressed.&#13;

    reconstruction needs o f the District o f Bam. The program aims at restoring the basic living&#13;
    conditions including the provision o f key social and economic services inthe affected region.&#13;
    The funding o f the reconstruction program relies primarily on Government financing as well&#13;
    as support from the World Bank, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, the Islamic&#13;
    Development Bank and countries from the Persian Gulf and Europe. Government&#13;
    contribution to the overall construction program exceeds US$200 million. The Bank-financed&#13;
    elements o f the comprehensive reconstruction program constitute the BEERP. Activities&#13;
    retained under the Bank-financed project were selected based on: (i)efficiency o f&#13;
    implementation; and (ii)      strategic focus (refer to Table-2).&#13;

31. Assessmentof the ProcurementCapacity of the HousingFoundation.The HF will be the&#13;
    agency in charge o f overall coordination and supervision o f the reconstruction activities. As&#13;
    such, the HF through BRO, will be directly responsible for managing procurement activities&#13;
    for its own urbanreconstruction component. Procurement activities for other components will&#13;
   be carried out by the line ministries or agencies responsible, like General Office o f Kerman o f&#13;
    the Ministryo f Roads and Transport, etc.&#13;
&#13;
32. An assessment o f the capacity o f the Implementing Agencies to implement procurement&#13;
    actions for the project was carried out between March and June 2004. The assessment&#13;
    reviewed the organizational structure for implementing the project and the procurement&#13;
    capacity at the HF. The latter was found to be generally adequate for normal procurement&#13;
   needs under GOI's procurement laws and regulations. However,             this was found to be&#13;
    inadequate for managing procurement activities in compliance with IBRD's Guidelines and&#13;
   procedures.&#13;
&#13;
33. Most o f the issues/ risks concerning the procurement component for implementation o f the&#13;
    project have been identified and include: (i) systemic issues o f divergences between national&#13;
    legislation and Bank Guidelines and procedures; (ii)      limited experience of, international&#13;
    public procurement practices, particularly in the application o f principles o f transparency;&#13;
    (iii) forenhancedintegrationofprocurementandtechnicalcapacitiesfortheproduction&#13;
         need&#13;
    o f generic specification and quantifiable evaluation criteria; (iv) limited exposure to Bank&#13;
    Guidelines and procurement practices; and (v) poor command o f the Englishlanguage.&#13;
&#13;
34. The mitigation measures which have beenincorporated into the project design consist of:&#13;
&#13;
             0  The BRO, in addition to carrying out procurement for the components under the&#13;
                responsibility o f HF, will be responsible for providing advisory services and&#13;
                supervision o f procurement and contract management to the other agencies and&#13;
                institutions implementing the other project components.        In other words, the&#13;
                BRO will carry overall responsibility for quality assurance and compliance with&#13;
                LA procurement provisions for all component o fthe Project;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                  9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              0  Strengthening BRO's procurement capacity by hiringa Procurement Coordinator&#13;
                 with qualifications and experience acceptable to the Bank. In particular, the&#13;
                 candidate should be able to communicate effectively inEnglish;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              0  Employing a highly qualified consulting firm to provide PASC to the BRO inthe&#13;
                 management o f procurement activities, preparation o f bidding documents,&#13;
                 assistance to other implementation agencies in the above activities, and&#13;
                 management o f reconstructionhehabilitation contracts carried out by other&#13;
                 agencies, including certification o f payment applications. The Draft TOR for the&#13;
                 services o fthe PASC are included inAttachment-5.&#13;
&#13;
35. Based on the existing information on the overall environment for procurement and in&#13;
   particular the approach to procurement under IBRD financed projects and the procurement&#13;
    capacity assessment o f the HF/BRO,the overall procurement risk assessment i sjudged to be&#13;
   high.As a result, the Borrower, for the first time under a Bankproject, has agreed to use part&#13;
    o f the loan proceeds to recruit an international procurement services consultant.&#13;
&#13;
36. Procurement Plan. The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a Procurement Plan for project&#13;
    implementation which provides the basis for the procurement methods (Attachment-6). This&#13;
   plan was reviewed and agreed upon during project appraisal. It i s available at the HF and the&#13;
    BRO offices inTehran and will be also available inthe Project's database and inthe Bank's&#13;
    extemal website. The Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement with the Project Team&#13;
    on an annual basis or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs.&#13;
&#13;
37. Frequency of Procurement Supervision. In addition to prior review, supervision to be&#13;
    carried out from Bank offices, the capacity assessment o f the Implementing Agency has&#13;
   recommended three supervision missions the for first year o f implementation and two full&#13;
    supervision missions per year afterwards during which post-reviews o f procurement will be&#13;
    carried out.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
&#13;
38. Risk Assessment and Mitigation Summary. The financial risks associated with this&#13;
    operation are considered high due to the: (i)      limited knowledge by the Bank team o f the&#13;
    procedures governing the emergency budget addendum under which the project will be&#13;
    implemented; (ii)   risk o f poor information transfer between Bam and Tehran on material&#13;
    delivery and distribution; (iii) limited warehousing and distribution facilities in Bam for the&#13;
    construction material purchased; and (iv) tracking the large number o f beneficiaries receiving&#13;
    construction material vouchers. Part o f the above risks were mitigated through the project&#13;
    design while others will require close supervision.&#13;
&#13;
39. The following mitigation measures were introducedinto the project design. These include:&#13;
&#13;
    0    The establishment o f the BRO inTehran and Bam to provide the required support and to&#13;
         validate any information neededby the FMUinTehran;&#13;
    0    The HF, being the agency implementing the purchase o f construction material has&#13;
         developed warehousing and distribution systems capable o f tracking the delivery process.&#13;
         Also, contracts for delivery o f construction materials will stipulate different delivery&#13;
         dates;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0    The BRO office inBam will be staffed with communications and legal officers to follow-&#13;
         up on any public complaints.&#13;
&#13;
40. Financial Management Arrangements. The financial management functions will be&#13;
    centralized at the FMUthat will be located at the HF and reportingto the BPGTF. The FMU&#13;
    will be responsible for project disbursements inaccordance with the appropriate policies and&#13;
   procedures o f the World Bank. All payments will be subject to the applicable controls, rules&#13;
    and regulations o f Iran in addition to the BRO verification and approval.        A full time&#13;
    Financial Controller (FC) will be assigned by the Ministry o f Finance to the FMU. An&#13;
    Accountant will be recruited to the FMU in order to assist the F C with the accounting tasks&#13;
    and the preparation o f withdrawal applications.     Also, an accounting system capable o f&#13;
    generating timely project reports will be established at the FMU.&#13;
&#13;
41. The FMU will maintain records and accounts, and prepare financial statements in a format&#13;
    acceptable to the World Bank. These shall reflect the operations, resources and expenditures&#13;
   related to the Loaflroject execution. Also, the FMU will maintain supporting documents&#13;
    supporting documents for all expenditures including those that are paid for fiom the Special&#13;
    Account. The records should reflect all categories o f withdrawals such as replenishments to&#13;
    the Special Account, reimbursements with SOEs and/or summary sheets with supporting&#13;
    documents, direct payments, and payments against Special Commitments issuedby the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
42. The IBRD Loan will be provided to the Islamic Republic o f Iran who will allocate the loan&#13;
    proceeds, on-grant basis, to the HF and the respective Government agencies. Also, the GO1&#13;
    will provide the counterpart funding, to the various ministries or organizations implementing&#13;
    the project. To ensure that funds are readily available for project implementation and&#13;
    following the Central Bank authorization, two accounts will be opened at a commercial bank&#13;
    and will be operated by the FMU. One account will be the project SA, denominated in U S&#13;
    Dollars, while the second will be in local currency and will deposit the project counterpart&#13;
    funds. The FMU will maintain and operate an accounting system to generate the quarterly&#13;
    Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs). The FMU staff will be subject to training in Bank&#13;
    guidelines and procedures. A detailed description o f the financial management arrangements&#13;
    i s included inAttachment-7.&#13;
&#13;
43. Auditing Arrangements. The records, accounts and financial statements o f the Project and&#13;
    the records and accounts for the SA for each fiscal year will be audited. This will be carried&#13;
    out in accordance with auditing standards acceptable to the Bank, consistently applied, by&#13;
    independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. Audited Financial Statements will be submitted&#13;
    to the World Bank as soon they become available but not later than six months after the end&#13;
    of the fiscal year. In fulfillment o f the LA, the Governing Body will engage a qualified&#13;
    independent audit firm according to terms of reference and scope o f work acceptable to the&#13;
    World Bank. The cost o f the audit will not be financed from the loan proceeds.&#13;
&#13;
DisbursementArrangements.&#13;
&#13;
44. Retroactive financing. Payments made for expenditures prior to the Loan signature date but&#13;
    after August 25,2004 in an aggregate amount not to exceed the equivalent o f US$40,000,000&#13;
    will be reimbursed to the Government upon presentation o f a withdrawal application with&#13;
    supporting documents and/or Statement o f Expenditures (SOEs).&#13;
&#13;
45. Use of Statements of Expenditures. SOEs will be used for all expenditures for: (i)     works&#13;
    under contracts costing less than US$ 500,000 equivalent each; (ii) under contracts&#13;
                                                                            goods&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                 11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      costing less than US$250,000; (iii)              services under consultant firms contracts costing less than&#13;
      US$lOO,OOO equivalent each and under individual consultant contracts costing less than&#13;
      US$50,000 equivalent each; under such terms and conditions as the IBRD shall specifL by&#13;
      notice to the Borrower.&#13;
&#13;
46. SpecialAccount. The SA will have an authorized allocation o f US$10 million and an initial&#13;
      deposit o f US$5 million, while the full allocation may be claimed when disbursements and&#13;
      special commitments reach US$30 million. Replenishment o f the SA would follow IBRD's&#13;
      procedures, and a bank's statement o f SA transactions would support all replenishment&#13;
      applications. The minimum amount for applications regarding direct payments and special&#13;
      commitments would be 20% o f the respective authorized allocations to the SA.&#13;
&#13;
SAFEGUARDS&#13;
&#13;
47. Environmental Aspects. The overall environmental impact o f the proposed project i s&#13;
      expected to be positive in that it supports the restoration o f necessary infrastructure in areas&#13;
      heavily damaged by the earthquake. Potentiallynegative environmental impacts are primarily&#13;
      associated with the construction works, such as land clearing, disposal o f debris and worker&#13;
      safety. Investments identified under the IBRD financing will only include reconstruction o f&#13;
      core units and will not involve major expansion o f space2nor invasion into green areas. The&#13;
      Project does not finance investments related to solid waste management facilities.&#13;
&#13;
48. To ensure full compliance with the IBRD's environmental and social safeguard requirements,&#13;
      and based on the best-practice models in similar earthquake recovery operations, a Social and&#13;
      Environmental Screening and Assessment Framework (SESAF) was finalized during&#13;
      appraisal (refer to Attachment-8). MASC will be financed under Component-E o f the&#13;
      project and will provide monitoring support to BROthroughout the project duration.&#13;
&#13;
49. The Project i s rated as a category "B", which requires the preparation o f an Environmental&#13;
      Assessment (EA) under OP.4.01. Under normal IBRD processing, official receipt and&#13;
      clearance o f the EA by the IBRDand public disclosure o f the EA both inIran and the IBRD's&#13;
      Info shop i s a prerequisite for appraisal.                 Given the emergency nature of the Project, an&#13;
      exemption from the application o f the above rule was obtained. As a result, the SESAF was&#13;
      disclosed inlocal language (Farsi) inIran and at the Bank prior to Board presentation. During&#13;
      Project implementation, all proposed projects will be screened to ensure that environmental&#13;
      and social risks, if any, could be adequately addressed through the application o f the&#13;
      standardized guidelines o fpracticeprovided for under the SESAF.&#13;
&#13;
50. Social Aspects. The social impacts o f the earthquake have been considerable. The main&#13;
      social concern is restoring livelihoods o f people as rapidly as possible. Given the&#13;
      comprehensive nature and citywide scale o f the reconstruction program, the following social&#13;
      safeguard policies may be triggered: Cultural Property (OPN. 11.03) and Involuntary&#13;
      Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12). OP 4.20 on indigenous peoples does not apply because persons&#13;
      affected by the project are neither vulnerable ethnic minority nor scheduled as tribal people&#13;
      withinthe provisions o fIranianlaw.&#13;
&#13;
51. CulturalProperty (OPN. 11.03) The Project does not finance works related to the cultural&#13;
      heritage sites in Bam. However, during the planned infrastructure works, caution should be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  For example, retrofitting works will aim at providingnecessary structural reinforcementto the existingbuildings (selection to be&#13;
finalizedduringthe StrategicAssessment Study) to be seismic-resistantand will not involve major expansion ofthe buildings.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                   12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    taken by the BRO and the implementation agencies to ensure protection o f the cultural&#13;
    heritage sites in case o f chance-finds. The above-mentioned SESAF includes guidelines on&#13;
    chance-finds procedures to be reinforced in all civil works. The project will liaise closely&#13;
    with the appropriate organizations such as United Nations Educational, Scientific and&#13;
    Cultural Organization (UNESCO) specialized in restoration o f the cultural and architectural&#13;
    heritage&#13;
&#13;
52. InvoluntaryResettlement (OP/BP 4.12). The Project i s not directly engaged in the physical&#13;
    reconstruction efforts. It finances, however, the provision o f equipment and construction&#13;
    material for the reconstruction o f housing and commercial buildings, and therefore, the&#13;
    chance o f triggering OP/BP 4.12 i s minimum.However given the large-scale reconstruction&#13;
    activities during the project period, possible triggering OP/BP 4.12 should not be totally ruled&#13;
    out. As a proactive measure, the above-mentioned SESAF has included guidelines to ensure&#13;
    application o f OPBP 4.12.&#13;
&#13;
53. The GO1has agreed to consult the Bank when relocations involve more than 25 families, and&#13;
   has agreed to implement the principles o f full compensation and livelihood restorationfor any&#13;
    Project Affected Person (PAP). This includes any person who, on account o f the execution o f&#13;
    the Project, has experienced or would experience direct economic and social impacts caused&#13;
    by the involuntary taking o f land resulting in: (i)   relocation or loss o f shelter; (ii) o f&#13;
                                                                                              loss&#13;
    assets or access to assets; or (iii)loss o f income sources or means o f livelihood, whether or&#13;
   not such person must move to another location, resulting in adverse impacts on the livelihood&#13;
    o f such person, provided that such person should have before the occurrence o f the&#13;
    Earthquake, either: (i) formal legal rights to land, including customary and traditional rights&#13;
    recognizedunder the laws o f the Borrower; or (ii) to such land or assets, provided that&#13;
                                                         claims&#13;
    such claims are recognized under the laws o f the Borrower, or become recognized through a&#13;
    process identified in the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). The GO1will review relocations&#13;
    on a case-by-case basis and will provide information to the Bank about any secondary&#13;
    displacement that has occurred to date. The Go1will review additional cases as they arise and&#13;
    ascertain that agreed procedures for resettlement and rehabilitation are being followed. Based&#13;
    on the agreed principles provided in the SESAF, a land acquisition data sheet will be&#13;
   prepared and agreed with the Bank duringthe first six months o f implementation.&#13;
&#13;
54. If land acquisition is necessary, the GO1will inform the Bank and prepare an appropriate&#13;
    RAP to ensure from the Government that the principles o f full compensation and livelihood&#13;
   restoration for affected persons will be applied. If private land is needed for&#13;
    relocatiodreconstruction land will be purchased on the principle o f willing seller-willing&#13;
    buyer. Decisions about land acquisition will be taken only after full consultation with the&#13;
    affected people and full disclosure o f information and entitlements. The owners and&#13;
    occupants o f the acquired land would be eligible for support based on the Bank's policy on&#13;
    Involuntary Resettlement. The GO1would work with agencies experienced in working with&#13;
    local populations to ensure proper consultation, compensation and relocation assistance to the&#13;
    displaced persons. In addition to providing details o f procedures for dealing with land&#13;
    acquisition and entitlement, the SESAF will outline provisions for the development o f an&#13;
    effective grievance redressing mechanism.&#13;
&#13;
55. Local Consultation. In order to ensure effective participation o f affected communities,&#13;
    especially the most vulnerable groups, a communication strategy will be finalized and agreed&#13;
   upon with the Borrower during the first six months o f Project implementation. The strategy&#13;
   presents the consultation process among different stakeholders (project implementation&#13;
    agencies, local governments, community leaders, NGOs, women, youth and children). Also,&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                  13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    a Sr. Social Officer and Sr. Legal Officer will be hired at BRO under the project in order to&#13;
    implement the Communication Strategy and the SESAF. They will also ensure: (i)       the timely&#13;
    consultation o f the affected population; (ii)the early identification o f social safeguard&#13;
    concerns; and (iii)  the sound implementation o frelevant mitigation measures.&#13;
&#13;
56. UrbanPlanning. InApril 2004, the HighCouncil o f Urban Planning and Architecture at the&#13;
    MHUDapproved the Structural Plan (2015) for the city of Bam. Duringproject preparation,&#13;
    IBRD experts reviewedthe draft Plan and presented comments to the GOI. Among the key&#13;
   recommendations were the protection o f buffer zones and the minimization o f potential&#13;
   resettlement and land expropriation. These have since been incorporated into the Plan. The&#13;
    GO1intends to proceed with the preparation o f the detailed city plans and, provision is made&#13;
   under Component-E of the BEERP to provide technical assistance to the GO1 (on needs-&#13;
   basis) to ensure coherence between the city plans and the reconstruction efforts (i.e. interms&#13;
    o f location, sequence, compliance with design ordinances and buildingcodes).&#13;
&#13;
57. Supervision. This project willjustify intense supervision. Inaddition to prior review, three&#13;
    full supervision missions are planned for the first year of implementation and two full&#13;
    supervision missions will be conducted each year in the field thereafter during which post-&#13;
   reviews o fprocurement will be carried out.&#13;
&#13;

Provision of ConstructionMaterialandEquipment for Housingand CommercialBuildings&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.       Scope&#13;
&#13;
Immediately following the earthquake o f December 2003, the Government initiated the revision&#13;
o f the land-use plan (2025) for the city o f Bam. Also, considering the high rate o f resident&#13;
ownership in the city (about SO%),    a reconstruction strategy based on rebuilding the housing and&#13;
commercial units "in-situ" has been implemented by the Government. This strategy promotes the&#13;
efficient reconstruction o f the city whilst securing an appropriate level of quality control during&#13;
the reconstruction process. This will be achieved through: (i)     training o f local engineers and&#13;
contractors; (ii) close supervision and monitoring o f the reconstruction activities by the Housing&#13;
Foundation (HF) and the Engineering Association o f Iran; and (iii)       the provision (on a grant&#13;
basis) o f basic construction material.&#13;
&#13;
As such, Component-A under the BEERPwill finance total o fUS$l50 million: (i) provisionthe&#13;
o f basic construction material as detailed in Annex-1 (US$1I O million); and (ii)  the provision o f&#13;
construction equipment (US$40 million) for housing and commercialbuildings.&#13;
&#13;
2: Constructionmaterialfor housingand commercialbuildings&#13;
(Estimated Cost: US$llO.OO million; IBRDJinancing: US$I10.00million)&#13;
&#13;
(a)- UrbanHousing&#13;
&#13;
Most o f the housing inthe urban areas consisted o f individual and low-rise buildings.These were&#13;
built mainly by owners usingtraditional constructionmethods with local adobe material or steel&#13;
structural elements and masonry. The traditional adobe buildingshad very thick, heavy roofs and&#13;
almost all such buildingscollapsed duringthe earthquake. Also, a highpercentage o f steel framed&#13;
masonry buildings collapsed in Bam, Baravat and the surrounding areas. According to the latest&#13;
available information, 24,598 housing units were severely damaged. These will be totally rebuilt&#13;
on existing sites usinghigher construction standards and appropriate material. The average size&#13;
o f a housing unit in the urban areas i s assumed to be around 1OOsq.m.and damage is estimated at&#13;
120 US$/sq.m. The damage estimates for urbanhousing are equal to US$295million.&#13;
&#13;
(9- Design and Supervision: The city of Bam was divided into eleven lots and each lot was&#13;
awarded to an architectural firm for the design o f around 2,000 housing units in each lot. In&#13;
addition, two architectural firms were entrusted with the design o f commercial units and one firm&#13;
will be responsible for the coordinationo fthe overall design activities. Another firmwill provide&#13;
back-up design support when needed. Firms will prepare architectural and engineering designs&#13;
for housing units up to 250 sq.m. in size. The designs will be reviewed by the "National&#13;
Engineering Association ofIran and will need to comply with a set o f financial, architectural,&#13;
                                   "&#13;
climatic and seismic criteria set by the newly established "Architectural Committee". The&#13;
Committee includes five prominent local architects and representatives from the MHUD , the&#13;
MOI and the HF. The cost o f engineering design will be met by the Government o f Iran and&#13;
construction supervision will be delegated to the "National Engineering Association of Iran "&#13;
through a contract with the HousingFoundation.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                      20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(i+ Reconstruction: The Government is in the process o f pre-qualifying around twenty (20) to&#13;
thirty (30) national contractors based ontheir: (i)     relevant experience; (ii) to introduce new&#13;
                                                                                         ability&#13;
and appropriate construction technologies; and (iii)           technical capacity and financial situation.&#13;
Each contractor i s expected to be awarded the reconstruction o f 500-1000 housing units o f&#13;
100sq.m. in size each. Individual house owners will select among the pre-qualified contractors&#13;
and enter into a contractual agreement with the retained contractor. The cost o f reconstruction&#13;
will be financed through a combination o f loans and grants that will be provided by the&#13;
Government to each individual house owner.                Basic construction material will be provided&#13;
through pre-assigned distributors in Bam via a voucher system. However, the cost o f labor and&#13;
finishing material will be funded through a loan scheme. The provision o f basic infrastructure&#13;
such as water and sanitation will be entrusted to local utilities and Government agencies.&#13;
&#13;
 (ii+ Government Compensation: The Government will compensate individual house owners&#13;

&#13;
(i) Damage To Commercial Properties: Prior to the disaster, services, including commercial&#13;
activity, represented 73% o f Bam urban employment. An estimated 3,346 commercial unitswere&#13;
destroyed in the disaster, including shops and workshops. About 60% o f the commercial units&#13;
were shops; the rest were classed as workshops. The average area per unit i s estimated at 100&#13;
sq.m. In addition there were approximately 15,000 sq.m. of warehouses and 4,200 sq.m. o f small&#13;
refrigerated warehouses. Intotal about 619,200 sq.m. o f commercial area was lost. The average&#13;
unit cost of replacingthese structures is estimated at US$180per sq.m. and the total replacement&#13;
cost of the structures amounts to approximately US$II1.5million.&#13;
(ii) Government Compensation and Bank Support to the Reconstruction of Rural Housing:: The&#13;
proposed reconstruction scheme for commercial properties i s similar to the one adopted by the&#13;
Government for the reconstruction o f urban housing. The pre-qualified contractors for the urban&#13;
housingwill be involved inthe reconstruction o f commercial properties as well. Each commercial&#13;
property owner will receive an initial US$I,190 grant and loans o f US$144 per xqm. with a&#13;
ceiling o f US$7,143 (5% annual interest over 15years). It shouldbe noted that dual or mixed use&#13;
commercial and housing units will be eligible for both facilities offered to the housing and&#13;
commercial units.Bank support to the reconstruction of commercial properties inB a m will focus&#13;
on funding part o f the procurement o f steel and cement material for a 30sq.m. size commercial&#13;

(Estimated Cost: US$40.00million; IBRDfinancing: US$40.00million)&#13;
&#13;
The mandate o f the Housing Foundation includes emergency reconstruction of rural villages&#13;
following natural disasters like floods and earthquakes. The emergency response activities rely on&#13;
a fleet o f heavy and medium construction equipment strategically distributed in the 28 provinces&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
of Iran. At times of heavy equipment demand, for debris removal or emergency reconstruction,&#13;
the fleet supplements the services provided by the private sector. The fleet includes about 1,015&#13;
pieces of equipment, more than half o f which are dump trucks. About 90% o f the equipment i s&#13;
more than 10,years old and more than 500 pieces are out o f service and beyond their economic&#13;
life, The Bank has already started assisting the Housing Foundation with the renewal of the&#13;
equipment fleet under the first EEW and will continue this assistance by financing the purchase&#13;
of an additional 454 pieces o f equipment, o f which about 312 dump trucks. Other main items&#13;
include debris excavation and removal equipment - wheel loaders and excavators. The total&#13;
estimated cost o f this sub-component i s about US$40million as detailed inTable 6.&#13;

&#13;
1. Scope&#13;
&#13;
Because o f the emergency nature o f the BEERP, the transport infrastructure activities included in&#13;
the project are limited to urgent works for the physical rehabilitation o f the Kerman-Bam&#13;
highway, the civil aviation airport of Bam and o f major internal roads in 22 severely damaged&#13;
villages. The BEERP will finance also the consulting services required for the detailed design&#13;
and construction supervision o f these works. The total o f the Component-B is estimated to be&#13;
US$29.32 million, which will finance rehabilitation o f key transport infrastructure affected by the&#13;
Earthquake as follows:&#13;
&#13;
2. Repairof the Kerman-Bamhighway&#13;
(Estimated Cost: US$21.OOmillion; IBRDJinancing: US$15.75million)&#13;
&#13;
(9 Rehabilitation Works: No major damages as a direct consequence o fthe earthquake havebeen&#13;
reported to the highway network in the province. Minor isolated damages to the vertical profile,&#13;
bridges and drainage structures are being repaired by the General Office (GO) of the Ministry of&#13;
Roads and Transportation (MORT) o f Kerman province with own financing.                 However, a&#13;
summary condition survey of the Kerman-Bam highway (190km), carried out in May-June 2004&#13;
indicates early signs o f severe pavement deterioration on several sections and some minor&#13;
damages to cross drainage structures. The road was originally built in the mid 1970's, but no&#13;
information was available on the scope and time o f overlays and maintenance operations. Recent&#13;
(June 2004) automated traffic counts, carried out by MORT, have measured traffic volumes o f&#13;
about 5500 passenger vehicles and about 1850 trucks per day. The additional traffic originated&#13;
by the transport o f construction materials and equipment is expected to generate only marginal&#13;
increases; however, these levels are already sufficient to accelerate a further deterioration o f the&#13;
pavement ifurgent rehabilitationi s not carried out.&#13;
&#13;
A provisional estimate carried out by the GO of MORT provides for a leveling course,&#13;
bituminous overlays and extension o f the bituminous base over the shoulders as detailed below.&#13;
In addition the works will include strengthening o f structures and provision o f signs, road&#13;
markings and other equipment (guardrails, traffic islands, etc.) to enhance traffic safety.&#13;

&#13;
(ii) Implementation Arrangements: The GO o f MORT o f Kerman province will be responsible&#13;
for implementation o f the works through contracts procured on the basis o f ICB. In order to&#13;
enhance competition and to ensure a short completion period (i.e. 18 months) the works will be&#13;
advertised in two lots o f about the same value following a slice and package approach, with the&#13;
option o f one contractor being awarded both lots ifpre-qualified for the corresponding amount.&#13;
&#13;
3. Repair of the BamAirport&#13;
(Estimated Cost: US4.IOmillion; IBRDJinancing: US3.ISmillion)&#13;
&#13;
(iii) Rehabilitation Works: The earthquake has caused the collapse o f the control tower and the&#13;
destruction or irreparable damage to ancillary buildings (fire fighting, emergency power supply,&#13;
etc.). The airport runway, taxiway and parking apron were originally built below standard in&#13;
1991: a 5 c m thick bituminous wearing course, provided for in the design, was not actually&#13;
constructed. Besides the initial weakness, these pavements have suffered damages from the&#13;
intense traffic in the weeks immediately following the earthquake (2500 take-offs and landings in&#13;
the first two weeks alone).     A preliminary engineering assessment by the Iran Civil Aviation&#13;
Organization provides for a complete resurfacing o f the runway, taxiway and apron with an&#13;
asphalt base (70"      thick) and an asphalt wearing course (50"      thick). In addition the project&#13;
will finance the reconstruction o f technical and ancillary buildings as detailed below.          All&#13;
estimates are based on existing standard designs for this type o fbuildingsand on current standard&#13;
rates for construction works published by the MPO:&#13;

&#13;
 (iii) Implementation Arrangements: As for the highway, the Governorate Office o f MORT o f&#13;
Kerman province will be responsible for implementation o f the works through private&#13;
contractors. It i s anticipated that the pavement rehabilitation and the civil works for buildings&#13;
will constitute two separate contracts procured on the basis o f NCB due to the relatively small&#13;
value. Communication and A T C equipment will be procured under shopping procedures while&#13;
the fire-fighting engine will be procured separately under N C B procedures.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
4. Repair of the Village Streets&#13;
(Estimated Cost: US2.OSmillion; IBRDJinancing: US$I..54million)&#13;
&#13;
No major damages to the rural roads have been reported. However, roads in the heavily damaged&#13;
villages will require rehabilitation, mainly after the completion o f the housing reconstruction&#13;
activities and the renovation o f the village infrastructure (water, sewage, side ditches, culverts,&#13;
etc) and the. A list o f those villages and the respective estimated investment costs required are&#13;
included inTable 3.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The width o f proposed streets varies between 8 to 12 meters including the sidewalks. The roads&#13;
are designed to have 15 c m of sub-base, 15 c m o f base and 7 c m o f pavement layers. On the basis&#13;
o f above figures, preliminary estimates for the reconstruction o f the major roads inthe 22 heavily&#13;
earthquake-affected villages amount to US$2.05million.&#13;

(I, Enaineerina Design and Construction Supervision under the reuair of the Kerman-Bum&#13;
highway: Inline with current practices by MORT, a consulting firm will be hired to carry out the&#13;
detailed design and construction supervision o f the works. The cost o f the services is estimated a&#13;
about 8% o f the work value, corresponding to about US$1.7 million, and i s in line with current&#13;
MPO rates for this type o f services. Selection o f the consultants will follow the QCBS method.&#13;
The scope o f the study would include: (i)detailed condition survey o f about 200 km o f main&#13;
highways; (ii)  traffic counts and forecast o f traffic growth including estimates o f reconstruction&#13;

&#13;
(ii) Engineering Design and Construction Supervision under the Repair of the Bam Airport: Also&#13;
in this case, the Governorate Office of the MORT in Kerman will employ consultants for he&#13;
design and supervision of the civil works contracts. The cost of the services i s estimated at 8% o f&#13;
the value o f the civil works and goods or about US$330,000. The consultants will be selected&#13;
following QCBS procedures and the scope o f their services will include: (i)      detailed condition&#13;
survey o f the airport runway and apron; (ii)    design o f the rehabilitation works required; (iii)&#13;
design o f the civil works for the control tower and ancillary buildings; and (iv) preparation o f&#13;
detailed plans, bill of quantities and technical specifications, including separate technical&#13;
specifications for communication, ATC and fire-fighting equipment, suitable for inclusion in the&#13;
IBRD's SBD.&#13;
&#13;
(iii) Engineerina Design and Construction Suuewision under the Repair of the Village Streets:&#13;
Road design studies for those villages will be carried out in coordination with the other type o f&#13;
structures undertaken by the other authorities. Implementation will start after the completion o f&#13;
the housing construction and placement o f water distribution lines. This project component will&#13;
be implemented by the Rural Department o f Housing Foundation under the overall coordination&#13;
o f BRO. Depending on the capacity o f the local contractors works can be tendered under one or,&#13;
the most, two packages. N C B procedure i s proposed for the tender o f the works. Local&#13;
consultants for design and supervision could be selected on the basis o f CQ procedures.&#13;

                       Repair ofthe TelecommunicationsInfrastructure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.Scope&#13;
&#13;
The Telecommunication system inBam, Baravat and surrounding villages was heavily damaged&#13;
duringthe earthquake. This includes damage to the telecommunication lines inBam (350km) and&#13;
Baravat (35km) and the rural area inthe Bam district (70km). Damage was also considerable at&#13;
the three switching centers inBam (2) and Baravat (1) and at the microwave station inBam. It is&#13;
reported that sixteen (16) administrative and operative units in Bam and Baravat were severely&#13;
affected. The total cost for Component C under BEERPi s estimated to be US$12.10.&#13;
&#13;
Currently the Kerman Telecommunications Company (KTC) i s offering fixed line and mobile&#13;
phone services to the inhabitants inthe cities o f Bam and Baravat as part o f the emergency relief&#13;
to ensure essential communication systems.         Prior to the earthquake,       there were 16,745&#13;
subscribers inBam and 2,300 inBaravat. Currently less than 1,500 lines are restored and the local&#13;
phone services are offered free o f charge, however, this i s not sufficient. Since the earthquake, the&#13;
I T C K T C has,restored:(1)a trunk switching center with a capacity o f 2200 trunks in Bam City;&#13;
(ii)localswitchingcenterwithacapacityof2,200inthecityofBaravat;; and(ii) 300&#13;
     a                                                                                      around&#13;
rural telecommunication offices.&#13;
&#13;
The KTC i s a subsidiary o f IranTelecommunications Company (ITC) (the holding company) and&#13;
the Ministry of Information Communication Technology (MICT). KTC i s accountable to the ITC&#13;
for maintenance, operation and expansion o f the telecommunications networks (including fixed&#13;
lines, mobile phones, microwave, fiber optic, data and any other infrastructure networks). The&#13;
K T C i s an independent legal entity with financial autonomy. All the company's asset belong to&#13;
ITCand are 100% Government owned.&#13;
&#13;
Bam telecom network i s connected to the national gnd through fiber optic and microwave&#13;
transmission systems. All the above investments are area networks and are operated and&#13;
maintainedby the KTC. Rebuilding o f the damaged cable network requires serious reconstruction&#13;
o f the buildingsand cable ducts. The KTC intends to install around 20,000 subscriber lines based&#13;
on Wireless Local Loop (WLL) in order to avoid restoring o f 350 km o f twisted pairs subscriber&#13;
distribution network. This will ensure fast provision o f services even to those living in the&#13;
temporary housing. It is also proposed that the mobile G S M network which had 3 BTS (Base&#13;
Stations) before the earthquake will be increased to 10BTS with a capacity o f 112TRX.&#13;
&#13;
The repair o f the telecommunications infrastructure under this project are shown in Table-1 and&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
1. SCOPE&#13;
&#13;
The experience o f the Bam earthquake and the failure o f key emergency response buildings inthe&#13;
district has confirmed the urgent need to retrofit and strengthen key emergency response&#13;
buildings throughout Iran. This component aims to improve the earthquake emergency&#13;
preparedness in the Province o f Kerman and the city o f Bam through: (i)         risk assessment and&#13;
retrofitting, on a pilot basis, o f key emergency response buildings inthe Province of Kerman; and&#13;
(ii) procurementofemergencyresponsevehiclesforthecityofBam.Itisexpectedthatthe&#13;
     the&#13;
experience acquired under this component could be replicated by the Govemment in the&#13;
remaining 26 Provinces of Iran. The total estimated cost for Component-D i s estimated at&#13;
US$lO.OO million, under which all of the activities will be implemented by BRO through close&#13;
coordinationwith the Govemorate of Kerman and concerned entities.&#13;
&#13;
2. Retrofittingof key emergency response buildings in the Province of Kerman (Estimated&#13;
Cost: US$5.00million; IBRDJinancing: US$3.75million)&#13;
&#13;
This activity will involve the retrofitting o f emergency response buildingsbased on: (i) results&#13;
                                                                                            the&#13;
o f the RiskAssessment and: (ii)      their strategic importance for emergency response intervention in&#13;
case o f an earthquake.. Being a pilot exercise, this activity will only focus on the buildings with&#13;
the highest ranking. The use o f appropriate construction materials and techniques will be taken&#13;
into consideration during the design o f retrofitting works. The unit cost o f retrofitting work in&#13;
Iran represents 40% to 50% o f the reconstruction cost and i s estimated to be equal to US$95 per&#13;
sq.m. It is also anticipated that approximately 50,000sq.m. of emergency buildings will be&#13;
retrofitted under this component at a total cost o fUS$5.00million.&#13;

&#13;
2. FinancialManagement&#13;
&#13;
Overall Arrangements. The IBRD Loan will be provided to the Islamic Republic o f Iran who&#13;
will allocate the loan proceeds, on grant basis,                         to the HF and the respective Government&#13;
agencies. The following legal documents define the overall arrangements with regards to the&#13;
financial management:&#13;
&#13;
            Presidential Decree establishing the "Bam Guidance and Policy Task Force (BGPTF)",&#13;
            an inter-ministerial committee chaired by the Minister o f Housing and Urban&#13;
            Development. The decree mandates the BGPTF with the same level o f decision-making&#13;
            authority as the Cabinet untilthe post-earthquake reconstruction i s declared as completed.&#13;
&#13;
            Budget addendum No. 16. that provides the above-mentioned BGPTF with the budgeted&#13;
            financial resources to achieve its mandate. It authorizes it to manage the flow o f funds&#13;
            for all reconstruction activities inall sectors2.&#13;
&#13;
Considering the above framework, financial management functions will be centralized at the&#13;
Financial Management Unit (FMU) that will be established in parallel with the BRO and will be&#13;
located at the HF. Reporting to the BGPTF, the FMU will be responsible for financial&#13;
management and project disbursements while procurement and contract award will be carried out&#13;
bythe respective implementingagencies assisted by BRO.&#13;
&#13;
ControlEnvironment.All payments, under the project, will be subject to Govemment controls&#13;
and regulations and will be complemented by the BRO approval o f all invoices and the&#13;
engagement o f an independent external auditor to perform year end audits. The Govemment&#13;
controls are applied through the MPO; the MOEAF; and the DiwanMouhassaba (DM).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  T h e current regulations do not allow a unique financial envelope for a multi-sectoral program and that the flow o f funds should be&#13;
managed per sector. Given this understanding, the mission notes that the arrangement on BPGTFi s a special arrangement for Bam.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                         78&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The project budget i s allocated by the MPO, budget expenditure controls are implementedby the&#13;
MOEAFthrough the provision o ffunds and payments approval. The DMapplies post-reviews on&#13;
transactions made to confirm compliance with the budget and other applicable laws. Approval o f&#13;
invoices will be carried out by the MOI, HF and by the BRO. An external independent auditor&#13;
will perfonnyearly audits on the project financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
Budget Accounts: Two project accounts were established by the MPO and a framework&#13;
agreement, detailing the flow o f funds and project implementation arrangements, will be signed&#13;
between the MPO and the BGPTF once the loan i s declared effective. The loan proceeds and the&#13;
counterpart funds will be allocated to those two accounts during project implementation. All&#13;
payments under the project will be charged to those accounts. These will be reconciled on&#13;
monthly basis with the parallel accounting system that will record the project financial&#13;
transactions and provideperiodical detailed reports.&#13;
&#13;
Accounting System: To ensure timely project monitoring reports under project implementation,&#13;
the FMU will seek the services o f a full time accounting consultant3 who will report directly to&#13;
the MOEAF Financial Controller located at the FMU. The accounting consultant will be&#13;
responsible for the installation and operation o f the accounting system. The accounting system&#13;
will reflect the separate project activities, by sector and categories indicating the source o f&#13;
financing. An accounting system i s currently being developed under a different Bank financed&#13;
project and will be used under this project to generate the required financial reports.&#13;
&#13;
Flow of Information: While the project will be implemented by different implementing&#13;
agencies, the accounting system will be managed by the FMU in Tehran. Each implementing&#13;
agency will provide, on a monthly basis, the necessary data on implementation progress and the&#13;
overall financial situation under the project . The data submitted will be compile inthe FMR and&#13;
will include:&#13;
&#13;
     0   List o f all signed contracts, detailing the amounts paid to date and showing the&#13;
         disbursement forecast, under each, for the coming six months;&#13;
     0   The activities that will be committed (contracts to be signed) during the next six months&#13;
         and the disbursement forecast under each;&#13;
     0   Physical progress report detailing the progress o fthe activities being implemented.&#13;
&#13;
Processingof Invoices. All payments under the project made from the SA will be issuedthrough&#13;
cheques signed by the: (i)      MOEAF's Financial Controller (FC) located at the FMU; (ii) byand&#13;
the Chairman o f the BGPTF (Le. the Minister o f Housing and Urban Development) or any person&#13;
he authorizes to sign on his behalf. This FC will be responsible for the project funds and for the&#13;
management o f the SA. The FMU will transfer funds from the loan account to the project's SA&#13;
that will be opened at a commercial bank as per the Central bank instructions. H e will be also&#13;
responsible for requesting counter part funds from the MOEAF. Deposits and payments out o f the&#13;
SA will be made in accordance with the provision o f the LA. The invoice processing chart and&#13;
the cash and information flow chart are shown inFigure-1 and Figure-2.&#13;

Objectives&#13;
&#13;
The Social and Environmental Screening and Assessment Framework (SESAF) provides general&#13;
guidelines, codes o f practice and procedures that are to be integrated into the initial phase o f the&#13;
World Bank-supported emergency earthquake recovery project. It provides a framework for&#13;
ensuring compliance with the World Bank's safeguard policies under current conditions in the&#13;
Islamic Republic o f Iran. Consistent with existing national legislation, the objectives of the&#13;
SESAF are to ensure that activities carried out under the proposed recovery operations will&#13;
address the following issues:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0 Enhance positive social and environmental outcomes;&#13;
    0 Protect human health and welfare;&#13;
    0 Minimize environmental degradation as a result o f individual sub-projects or their&#13;
        cumulative effects;&#13;
    0 Fairly compensate for any loss o f livelihood; and,&#13;
    0 Minimize impacts on cultural property&#13;
&#13;
General Principles&#13;
&#13;
Recognizing the emergency nature o f the proposed recovery operations, and the related need to&#13;
provide emergency assistance, while at the same time ensuring due diligence in managing&#13;
potential social and environmentalrisks, the SESAF i s based on the following principles:&#13;
&#13;
    0   To ensure the effective application o f the World Bank's safeguard policies, the SESAF&#13;
        provides guidance on the approach to be taken during implementation for the selection&#13;
        and design o f sub-projects, and the planning o f mitigation measures.&#13;
    0   Resettlement issues are likely to be minimal as most reconstruction efforts are likely to&#13;
        take place in situ. Inthe event that involuntary resettlement i s necessitated then detailed&#13;
        Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) will be developed in accordance with Operational&#13;
        Policy (OP) 4 will be prepared and based on the RAP, the project authorities will make&#13;
        every effort to minimize displacement and restore livelihoods.&#13;
    0   Environmental category `A' sub-projects are not expected in the Project.                  But&#13;
        environmental screening will be carried out based on the checklist (see Attachment 1) to&#13;
        confirm this before obtaining approval for sub-project launch. If any do occur,&#13;
        Environmental Assessments (EAs) for specific sub-projects will be prepared during&#13;
        implementation. Corrective measures in the form o f an Environment Management Plan&#13;
        (EMP) will be built into the emergency recovery project, in accordance with #13 o f O.P.&#13;
        4.01 and #5 o f B.P. 4.01.&#13;
    0   The proposed emergency recovery operations will finance feasibility and detailed design&#13;
        studies for these investments when and if they should be envisaged. These will include&#13;
        social a's well as environmental assessments as required by World Bank safeguard&#13;
        policies.&#13;
    0   Care will be taken to ensure that vulnerable sections o f the population (particularly the&#13;
        poor, women, orphans, the elderly and the physically disabled) are included in project&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                  87&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         design. Where employment opportunities are available within sub-projects, care will be&#13;
         taken to ensure that the affected populations can benefit. Inall sub-projects, arrangements&#13;
         for ensuring effective consultations with and the meaningful participation o f local&#13;
         communities (both male and female) will be made to elicit their different views and foster&#13;
         local ownership o fthe design.&#13;
    0    The SESAF will be disclosed in the offices o f the concerned implementing agencies, in&#13;
         prominent public places locally, and inthe World Bank Infoshop.&#13;
&#13;
ProjectDescription&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
     Component-E- Project Management and Technical Assistance: This component supports&#13;
     (i) managementthroughtheestablishmentoftheBRO;and(ii)&#13;
        project                                                               technical assistance to&#13;
     the BRO, aiming at assisting project implementation and improving project management&#13;
     capacity through the procurement o f consultants for Procurement Advisory Services,&#13;
     MonitoringAdvisory Services andTechnical Advisory Services.&#13;
&#13;
Social and EnvironmentalScreening andAssessment Framework(SESAF)&#13;
&#13;
This SESAF has been developed specifically for the proposed sub-projects to ensure due&#13;
diligence, to avoid causing harm or exacerbating social tensions, and to ensure consistent&#13;
treatment o f social and environmental issues by project authorities and those workmg for them.&#13;
The purpose o f this framework i s also to assist the Project Implementing Agencies in screening&#13;
all sub-projects for their likely social and environmental impacts, identifying documentation and&#13;
preparation requirements and prioritizing investments.&#13;
&#13;
OP. 4.01 EnvironmentalAssessment. Most o f the proposed sub-projects are likely to focus on&#13;
the repair and structural reinforcement o f damaged buildings, roads, Bam airport and&#13;
telecommunication networks.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                  88&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Considering the limited nature and scale o f potential environmental impacts, most, if not all, o f&#13;
the proposed operations are likely to be classified as Category `B' sub-projects. Therefore, for&#13;
sub-projects with potential adverse impacts, a limited Environmental Assessment will be&#13;
undertaken during project and will apply the following minimum standards during&#13;
implementation:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     0   The inclusion o f standard environmental codes o fpractice inthe repair and reconstruction&#13;
         biddocuments o fall sub-projects;&#13;
     0   Review and oversight o fany major reconstruction works by specialists;&#13;
     0   Implementation o f socially and environmentally sound options for the disposal o f debris;&#13;
         and,&#13;
     0   Provision o f adequate budget and satisfactory institutional arrangements for monitoring&#13;
         effective implementationthrough the inclusion o f an Environment Officer inthe BRO       .&#13;
&#13;
The environmental guidelines are designed to provide guidance to the BRO                     and the&#13;
implementation agencies on the procedures used to identify those investments that may induce&#13;
negative environmental impacts. Guidance i s given on the mitigation o f negative environmental&#13;
impacts that may accrue from sub-project construction. The guidelines are to be implemented&#13;
duringthe application, screening, assessment, approval and execution o finvestments.&#13;
&#13;
Under the BEERP most o f the eligible investments will involve repair and structural&#13;
reinforcement of transport facilities (airport buildings), public buildings (retrofitting works) as&#13;
well as telecommunication networks and village streets in affected areas. Sewage treatment&#13;
plants, solid waste equipment, waste disposal sites are not eligible for financing under the&#13;
BEERP. All investments will be subjected to environmental screening and assigned to one o f&#13;
three categories (A, B, and C) depending on the magnitude and adversity o f predicted&#13;
environmental impacts.         No BEERP investments are expected to be given a category `A'&#13;
classification. Most are expected to fall into category `C' and will thus not require an&#13;
environmental assessment. In most cases, any necessary impact mitigation will be inherent in&#13;
standard engineering design and good construction practice. Investments considered to impose&#13;
unacceptable negative environmentalimpacts will not be approved for financing.&#13;
&#13;
OP 4.12 InvoluntaryResettlement.The needfor landacquisition or for involuntary resettlement&#13;
in specific sub-projects will only be known during project implementation, when site-specific&#13;
plans are available. Sub-projects will therefore be screened for applicability of the resettlement&#13;
policy. Any sub-projects involving involuntary resettlement or land acquisition o f more than 25&#13;
families will only be approved after the preparation o f a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. Several issues are likely to increase the complexity o f land acquisition -&#13;
the availability o f reliable landrecords, the inability o fpeople to document ownership, the demise&#13;
o f occupants and subsequent uncertainty about transfers o f title. The Government has also agreed&#13;
to implement the principles o f full compensation and livelihood restoration for any Project&#13;
Affected Person (PAP). This includes any person who, on account o f the execution of the Project,&#13;
has experienced or would experience direct economic and social impacts caused by the&#13;
involuntary taking o f land resulting in: (i)relocation or loss o f shelter; (ii) o f assets or access&#13;
                                                                               loss&#13;
to assets; or (iii)&#13;
                  loss o f income sources or means o f livelihood, whether or not such person must&#13;
move to another location, resulting in adverse impacts on the livelihood o f such person, provided&#13;
that such person should have before the occurrence o f the Earthquake, either: (i)       formal legal&#13;
rights to land, including customary and traditional rights recognized under the laws o f the&#13;
Borrower; or (ii)  claims to such land or assets, provided that such claims are recognized under the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                89&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
laws o f the Borrower, or become recognized through a process identified in the Resettlement&#13;
Action Plan (RAP). The GO1will review relocations on a case-by-case basis and will provide&#13;
information to the Bank about any secondary displacement that has occurred to date. The&#13;
safeguards framework includes procedures for identifying eligible project affected people,&#13;
calculating and delivering compensation, and mechanisms for dealing with grievances. It i s good&#13;
practice for the borrower to undertake a social assessment and implement measures to minimize&#13;
and mitigate adverse social impacts, particularly as they affect poor and vulnerable groups.&#13;
&#13;
OP 4.20 Indigenous Peoples. The five defining characteristics normally used to define&#13;
indigenous peoples are inappropriate in Iran's case and positive discrimination in favor o f any&#13;
group on these grounds i s likely to be counter-productive and to exacerbate divisions between&#13;
communities. A vulnerability assessment will be built into the social assessments to be&#13;
undertaken for cases at high risk in terms o f social safeguardprotection, to ensure effective&#13;
consultations with and culturally appropriate benefits to each o f the vulnerable groups and will&#13;
incorporate adequate measures to address such vulnerability insub-project design.&#13;
&#13;
OPN 11.03 Cultural Property. Sub-projects will be reviewed for their potential impact on&#13;
cultural property, and clear procedures will be developed for the identification and protection o f&#13;
cultural property and will be included in standard bidding documents. Sub-project preparation&#13;
may involve the identification o f and assistance for the preservation o f culturally important sites.&#13;
Ifthese opportunities occur, culturalproperty management plans will be prepared for these sub-&#13;
projects.&#13;
&#13;
OP 4.37 Safety of Dams.No dams will be repairedunder the project.&#13;
&#13;
Safeguard Screening and Mitigation. The selection, design, contracting, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation o f sub-projects will be consistent with the guidelines, codes o f practice and&#13;
requirements included as Attachments to the Social and Environmental Screening and&#13;
Assessment Framework. These include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   A list o fnegative characteristics renderinga proposed sub-project ineligible for support;&#13;
    0   A proposedchecklist o f likely social and environmentalimpacts to be submitted for each&#13;
        sub-project;&#13;
    0   A sample Environmental and Safeguards procedure for inclusion in the technical&#13;
        specifications o f contracts;&#13;
    0   Procedures for the protection o f cultural property, including chance discoveries;&#13;
    0   Relevant elements o f the codes of practice for the prevention andor mitigation o f&#13;
        potential environmental impacts;&#13;
    0   Guidelines for land and asset acquisition, entitlements and compensation.&#13;
&#13;
Responsibility for Safeguard Screening and Mitigation. Each implementation agency&#13;
(Housing Foundation o f Islamic Revolution, sector ministries and utilities represented at the&#13;
provincial Government level) will be responsible for applying the safeguard screening and&#13;
mitigation requirements as defined in the Framework to its own investments and will work&#13;
closely with the BRO and the Department o f Environment. The BRO will be responsible for&#13;
close coordination with the implementation agencies in order to ensure compliance by the&#13;
implementationagencies with the safeguard requirements as defined inthe framework.&#13;
&#13;
Capacity-Building and Monitoring of Safeguard Framework Implementation. Technical&#13;
assistance services will be mobilized under the Project Management Component o f the Project to&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                90&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
provide guidance and review o fthe application o f the SESAF. As part o f the technical assistance,&#13;
the BRO, together with relevant staff o f the implementation agencies will receive training in&#13;
SESAF's application.      During supervision o f the project, the World Bank will assess the&#13;
implementation o f the SESAF, and recommend additional strengthening ifrequired.&#13;
&#13;
Consultation andDisclosure.The Government o fIslamic Republic o fIranwill publicly disclose&#13;
the SESAF. It will be disclosed in Farsiby the BRO on behalf o f the Government o f the Islamic&#13;
Republic o f Iran, both nationally and locally. It will also be made available to the public at the&#13;
BRO offices, and at the Word Bank's Infoshop. Relevant project specific safeguards&#13;
documentdmitigation plans subsequently prepared will also be disclosed and be publicly&#13;
available to local citizens. The implementing agencies will consult project-affected people, local&#13;
government and non-government organizations on the project's social and environmental aspects,&#13;
and will take their views into account during preparation o f sub-projects. The implementing&#13;
agencies will initiate these consultations as early as possible to solicit the effective participation&#13;
of the local population in its activities wherever appropriate. The implementing agency will also&#13;
provide relevant materials ina timely manner prior to consultations, in a form and a language that&#13;
are understandable and accessible, to ensure that meaningful consultations can take place and that&#13;
relevant information i s available to concerned citizens. Draft reports and plans will be made&#13;
available to project-affected groups and to local civil society organizations and will normally be&#13;
considered to be inthe public domain.&#13;

            Iran - Bam Earthquake Emergency
            Reconstruction Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Bam Earthquake Emergency
            Reconstruction Project (BEERP) for Iran aims to (a) restore
            the living conditions of the communities affected by the
            earthquake, (b) improve emergency preparedness in the
            Province of Kerman and the city of Bam, and (c) strengthen
            the planning and management capacity under the
            reconstruction program. Considering the complexity of the
            reconstruction efforts and taking into account the
            Bank's country and international experience in
            earthquake projects, the project will be implemented over a
            four-year period. The funding of the reconstruction program
            relies primarily on Government financing as well as support
            from the World Bank, the Japan Bank for International
            Cooperation, the Islamic Development Bank and countries from
            the Persian Gulf and Europe. There are five project
            components (some with multiple subcomponents): 1) provision
            of construction material and equipment for housing and
            commercial buildings; 2) repair of the transport
            infrastructure; 3) repair of the telecommunications
            infrastructure; 4) improved emergency preparedness in the
            province of Kerman and the district of Bam; and 5) project
            management and technical assistance.
