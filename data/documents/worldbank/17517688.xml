&amp;#12;Biharâ&#128;&#153;s agriculture sector employs more than eighty percent of the labor force and more than four-&#13;
fifths of these farmers are small and marginal. They have one of the lowest agricultural productivity&#13;
in India that has not increased due to several constraints. Jeevika, a project jointly supported by the&#13;
World Bank and the Government of Bihar, has piloted, customized and eventually scaled-up several&#13;
innovative livelihood interventions to improve the well-being of poor households in Bihar. A number&#13;
of innovative aspects account for the success of these livelihoods programs in the state. Foremost&#13;
among these is the fact that it was implemented through community-driven and community-owned&#13;
institutions. The institutional platform that was facilitated by the project has enabled the creation of&#13;
a single-window system at the doorstep of small and marginal farmers. Farmers can now demand&#13;
better services from the public sector, access credit from commercial banks, and experiment&#13;
and customize various technologies. This note will focus on System of Crop Intesificationâ&#128;&#153; (SCI),&#13;
which has evolved from a well-known farming methodology called System of Rice Intensification.&#13;
It has been customized and adopted for wheat, green gram, oil seeds and vegetables in Bihar. The&#13;
participant farmers have witnessed 86% increase in rice productivity and 72% increase in wheat&#13;
productivity. The profitability of rice cultivation has increased 2.5 times and has almost doubled for&#13;
oil-seeds. Since 2008, implementation of SCI has contributed to an additional income increase of&#13;
around US$10.7 million.&#13;

      Bihar is the third most populous state in India with                                                      lower than the all India average of 37%.&#13;

Technologies and Practices&#13;
â&#128;&#152;Jeevikaâ&#128;&#153;         has       introduced         several        livelihood      Seed treatment under SCI&#13;
interventions in the last five years based on the&#13;
demands of the communities. Most communities were&#13;
keen to productively use credit and enhance their&#13;
agricultural income. The project also recognized that&#13;
enhancement of agriculture income can significantly&#13;
impact poverty incidence in the state and improve&#13;
food security. A well-known methodology called&#13;
System of Rice Intensification was introduced under&#13;
the project in 2007. It was chosen for two primary&#13;
reasons. First, it is not capital intensive but focuses on&#13;
intensification of knowledge, skill and management.                           early establishment and sufficient spacing for roots to&#13;
Second, it has successfully demonstrated improved                             grow. SCI is different from the conventional method&#13;

    Nursery preparation under SCI&#13;
                                                    Land preparation: In SCI, land needs to be ploughed&#13;
                                                    well so that the soil is pulverized for easy root growth,&#13;
                                                    and appropriate soil moisture should be maintained&#13;
                                                    by adequate irrigation.&#13;
&#13;
                                                    Transplantation18: In the SCI method, seedlings from&#13;
                                                    the nursery that are transplanted into the field are&#13;
                                                    younger compared to the conventional method.&#13;
                                                    Younger seedlings have a higher potential for tillering&#13;
                                                    and rooting. Furthermore, it is important to plant&#13;
    Transplantation in the conventional method      seedlings quickly after removal from the nursery as&#13;
                                                    swift transplantation helps in avoiding trauma and&#13;
                                                    shock, which can impede growth. For example, rice&#13;
                                                    seedlings that are 8-15 days old are transplanted&#13;
                                                    directly in the field within 15-30 minutes of gentle&#13;
                                                    removal.&#13;
&#13;
                                                    Wider spacing in a uniform manner: In conventional&#13;
                                                    farming seedlings are not transplanted in a uniform&#13;
                                                    manner, which limits the growth of the plant.&#13;
                                                    However, the SCI methodology has crop-specific&#13;
                                                    recommendations              for    spacing        and      shaping.&#13;
    Transplantation through the SCI method&#13;
                                                    Adequate spacing improves the aeration of the&#13;
                                                    roots of the plant and gives them sufficient area for&#13;
                                                    nutrient absorption. For instance, wheat and rice are&#13;
                                                    transplanted in the shape of a square, while rapeseed&#13;
                                                    is transplanted in â&#128;&#156;Lâ&#128;&#153; or â&#128;&#156;Iâ&#128;? shape.&#13;

                                                    Efficient water management: The optimal water&#13;
                                                    management for SCI is alternate drying and wetting,&#13;
                                                    which minimizes the water requirement for that&#13;
                                                    crop. Continuous flooding or long intervals between&#13;
                                                    irrigation should be avoided. SCI methodology has&#13;

&#13;
                                                    Rotary weeding and soil aeration: The field is not&#13;
                                                    hoed in the conventional farming method but in SCI&#13;
                                                    the land is weeded at regular intervals. This ensures&#13;
                                                    lesser wastage of soil nutrients and better aeration&#13;
                                                    and thus enables profuse growth of the roots.&#13;
&#13;
                                                    Use of organic fertilizers: Under the SCI method, there&#13;
                                                    is an emphasis on the usage of organic fertilizers like&#13;

     Box 2: Use of technology in extension systems&#13;
&#13;
     Jeevika has also integrated ICT with its current extension mechanism to make it more robust and effective&#13;
     to meet its increasing communication needs. It has collaborated with Digital Green to create a locally&#13;
     generated video database of various interventions. Digital Green is a Delhi based non-profit, which has&#13;
     been at the forefront of digital technology with community driven extension programs.&#13;
&#13;
     Digital Green videos feature community members and provide a reliable and comprehensive information&#13;
     package on various agricultural practices. These videos have helped in faster and cheaper dissemination&#13;
     of information. Furthermore, it has created a sustainable system, which can exist even after Digital Green&#13;
     withdraws support from the project. The project started as a pilot in 100 villages of one district and has&#13;
     been scaled up to 5 districts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 agencies20 had prior experience in implementing&#13;
 similar interventions at large scale. The partner&#13;
 agencies have been crucial in helping the project&#13;
 build up the capacities of the project staff, village&#13;
 organizations and the community para-professionals&#13;
 associated with the intervention.&#13;
&#13;
 Jeevika aims to make this extension system self-&#13;
 sustainable in the long run. Two years ago a concept&#13;
 of â&#128;&#156;fee based extension servicesâ&#128;? was introduced.&#13;
 Under this initiative, the farmers are encouraged to&#13;
 pay 50 percent of all expenses (approximately US$1.8&#13;
 per season) to the Village Resource Persons.Â These&#13;
 charges are collected by the village organizations at&#13;
 the beginning of the season.Â &#13;
&#13;
 A recent study also found out that technical agencies&#13;
 can gradually withdraw from villages after three-four&#13;
 years. The monitoring of the field implementation in&#13;
 these areas is usually main streamed and is carried out&#13;
 by the block level staff after the agency withdraws.&#13;
 Eventually SCI becomes a standard practice in&#13;
 mature community organizations, which significantly&#13;
 reduces project expenditure and further improves&#13;
 the ROI.&#13;

     Bihar Innovation Forum was organized in 2007. One of the technical service agencies of SCI -PRADAN â&#128;&#147;&#13;
     was selected from BIF. It provided a platform for innovators, social entrepreneurs and private sector com-&#13;
     panies to show case their innovative ideas in livelihood and related sectors. It also gave an opportunity for&#13;
     the innovators to partner with BRLPS and other agencies in Bihar government to pilot the idea at a large&#13;
     scale. BIF encourage participation of innovative solutions that addressed both the supply and demand&#13;
     issues. BIF â&#128;&#147; I focused on last-mile service delivery of public and private services, health and nutrition, edu-&#13;

         fully adopted the SCI methodology. A detailed 13 state agricultural study conducted under the IWMI-Tata Water Policy program&#13;
         showed a similar increase of productivity for famers that adopted System of Rice Intensification. Although the study hasnâ&#128;&#153;t included&#13;
         Bihar but Madhya Pradesh, which has similar landholding pattern, witnessed a 68% increase in productivity for rice amongst full&#13;

Phool Kumari Devi, Muzaffarpur,&#13;
had a small farm of 0.17 acres.&#13;
After she started practicing SCI&#13;
for wheat on her farm - the output&#13;
went up from 0.15 tonnes to 0.35&#13;
tonnes. The increased income&#13;
after SCI enabled Phool Kumari&#13;
to recover an additional 0.67&#13;
acres, which was a collateral&#13;
for a loan. Now her landholding&#13;
has increased to 1.25 acres and&#13;
she grows wheat through the&#13;
SCI method on the whole field.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During the pilot phase in 2007,&#13;
Barti Devi,a member of a SHG&#13;
from Gaya, had difficulties&#13;
convincing her husband, Dilu&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                           Voices from the Ground&#13;
Yadav to practice SCI for rice.&#13;
After four rounds of heated&#13;
arguments and negotiations&#13;
at home, Barti Devi convinced&#13;
her husband and started&#13;
implementing SCI on her land.&#13;
Due to the SCI methodology,&#13;
her productivity increased to&#13;
4 tonnes per acre. She is now&#13;
a role model for many SHG&#13;
women. She travels across&#13;
several project villages, before&#13;
the start of season, to assist&#13;
the project staff in recruiting&#13;
new SHG members for the SCI&#13;
intervention.&#13;

            Enhancing agricultural livelihoods through
            community institutions in Bihar, India
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Bihar is the third most populous state
            in India with over 100 million inhabitants. The state&#146;s
            economy is dominated by agriculture: it constitutes 19.2
            percent of state&#146;s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs
            nearly 75 percent of the labor force. 92.8 percent of the
            farmers in Bihar are small and marginal (small holders),
            which is much higher than the all India average of 83.5
            percent2. In addition, only 29 percent of households own any
            land and the average landholding size is approximately one
            acres3. Furthermore, Bihar&#146;s agriculture productivity is one
            of the lowest in India. For instance, the average
            productivity of paddy and wheat, the two major crops of the
            state, is much lower than the national average. The
            productivity of smallholders is further lower than the state
            average. Agriculture productivity in Bihar also affects food
            security as 88 percent of Bihar&#146;s poor depend on farming for
            subsistence. Currently, programs that have not customized
            and adopted technologies for smallholders, have met with
            limited success. Other programs that are administered in a
            top-down manner have had a very slow adoption rate and
            limited long-term impact. These interventions have neither
            addressed the root of the problem nor the intergenerational
            nature of landlessness and poverty.
