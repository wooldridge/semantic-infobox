ABSTRACT&#13;
This report is part of an inquiry undertaken by the World Bank&#13;
in conjunction with scholars from 12 industrial countries into the&#13;
penetration of the markets of industrial countries by exports of&#13;
manufactures from developing countries. The project sought to establish&#13;
the shares of industrial country markets heLd by the developing&#13;
countries, changes in such shares in the 1970s, and why they vary among&#13;
industry groups and countries.      The aim is to assist developing and&#13;
industrial   countries  to  improve   their  policies   through  a  better&#13;
understanding of trade patterns and protectionist pressures.&#13;
In the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), the 1980s&#13;
are likely to see a continuation of the trade competition from&#13;
developing countries and resultant pressures for adjustment. This paper&#13;
looks at the determinants of West Germany's comparative advantage, using&#13;
that information in combination with evidence about the evolution of&#13;
factor endowments and economic policies to assess the likely direction&#13;
of West Germany's future specialization, particularly with respect to&#13;
developing countries.   Finally, the role of polic:y in influencing West&#13;
Germany's specialization and structural adjustment is discussed.&#13;
Traditionally, two theories have been used to explain Germany's&#13;
comparative advantage:    neo-factor proportions and neo-technology.    Of&#13;
the two, the neo-factor proportions theory has been the more useful in&#13;
explaining the patterns of trade with developing countries, and it has&#13;
confirmed the importance of human capital intensity in determining the&#13;
pattern of north-south trade.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
This study tested the two theories in light of more current&#13;
data and with somewhat different emphases than have been used in the&#13;
past.   In particular, tests were run to determine if any subgroup of&#13;
human capital -- specifically craftspeople -- was an important&#13;
determinant. With respect to the neo-technology approach, two variables&#13;
were used: innovativeness (R&amp;D) and economies of scale. The tests were&#13;
run across and within industries.&#13;
Several conclusions emerged.    Craftspeople in fact carried the&#13;
burden of explanation, with physical capital becoming insignificant with&#13;
respect to trade with developing countries.     Similarly, innovativeness&#13;
and scale economies performed less well.&#13;
The results also indicated that the developing countries are&#13;
competitive with West Germany in a far wider range of products than was&#13;
previously thought.    The international division of labor between West&#13;
Germany and the developing countries is actually quite broad-based.&#13;
These findings suggest several probable trends in the future.&#13;
The faster that income in the developing countries grows, the faster&#13;
they will become competitive in an even wider range of goods. For its&#13;
part,   West  Germany's   specialization   will  lie   in  human   capital&#13;
(especially   craftspeople)-   intensive   industries   or   branches   of&#13;
industries.   However, West German exports may be more susceptible to&#13;
downward price pressures in the world markets than previously thought.&#13;
While innovativeness will also be important, it cannot in itself&#13;
determine   comparative  advantage   because  of  a  rapid   diffusion  of&#13;
innovation through the world economy.    The role of this factor cannot,&#13;
however, be established with any certainty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A second   factor of uncertainty in predicting the future is&#13;
commercial policy.    As competition from below intensifies, so will the&#13;
demand in West Germany for protection. As such, the government's policy&#13;
response will be important in determining the nature of West Germany's&#13;
future  international   competitiveness.     As   shown  in  the  cases   of&#13;
agriculture and food in West Germany, commercial policy at the EC and/or&#13;
national levels can reverse the outcome that would have occurred in the&#13;
absence of protection.     While policy has not had the same effect in&#13;
other industries, it has definitely influenced the pattern of their&#13;
resource use.&#13;

Chapter I&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
Throughout the decade of the 1970s, the world economy was&#13;
subjected to repeated shocks, shocks which demanded of the open&#13;
economies  a high   degree   of  structural  adaptability.    The  Federal&#13;
Republic of Germany (West Germany) was no exception. Because of policy&#13;
changes in the developing countries initiated even earlier, exports of&#13;
manufactured goods from those countries began to capture increasing&#13;
shares of the markets in which West Germany had long been an entrenched&#13;
supplier, among them clothing, textiles and leather goods.      The decade&#13;
also witnessed the emergence of Japan as a major supplier of goods in&#13;
which West Germany had held a decisive competitive edge, such as&#13;
electrical  engineering  products and, more recently, automobiles.       A&#13;
third factor was the sharp major price increases for energy-related and&#13;
other raw materials, which placed profound adjustment pressures on&#13;
industries in West Germany.&#13;
These developments in turn contributed to, or at least&#13;
proceeded concomitantly with, policy changes within West Germany and the&#13;
EC, changes which tended to hinder the structural adjustments that&#13;
otherwise would have been induced by the emergence of radically altered&#13;
supply conditions in the rest of the world.     These policy measures, in&#13;
their turn, were bound to affect adversely the chances of new suppliers,&#13;
as well as reduce the efficiency of the international division of labor&#13;
and the gains from trade.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
There is no a priori reason to expect the decade of the 1980s&#13;
to be any different in terms of the degree to which major unexpected&#13;
changes will occur in the world economy.      Hence, further pressure for&#13;
adjustment will continue to be exerted upon the West German economy,&#13;
even though the precise details are unknown and unknowable at present.&#13;
Nevertheless, based on today's perspective of the impact of potential&#13;
changes in the world economy and of the foreseeable changes in West&#13;
Germany's factor endowment and economic policies, and given the observed&#13;
and well-tested empirical patterns in the determinants of inter-&#13;
industrial specialization, some assessment of the likely future course&#13;
of the country's specialization in international trade is possible.&#13;
There are several compelling reasons for undertaking such an&#13;
attempt:&#13;
o    West Germany constitutes a large, growing and still&#13;
relatively   liberal   market   for   the  exports   of&#13;
manufactured goods from developing countries (Table&#13;
1).    Hence,   the  future   course  of   West  German&#13;
specialization and its determinants is important to&#13;
the developing countries.&#13;
O    The changes to be expected in the world economy will&#13;
in any case profoundly affect West Germany by inten-&#13;
sifying the pressure    for adjustment there.     It is&#13;
important to realize that the emergence of new&#13;
sources of supply in the world economy is an ongoing&#13;
process and that structural adjustment is not a once-&#13;
and-for-all project, but rather must also remain&#13;
ongoing.&#13;

One objective of this paper is to bring together evidence on&#13;
the determinants of West Germany's specialization..    This information is&#13;
then combined with evidence on the evolution of factor endowments and&#13;
economic policies, following which the likely future course of the&#13;
country's specialization is assessed.     A key focus of the analysis is&#13;
the continuing, if not continuous, emergence of new sources of supply&#13;
and adjustment pressures across many branches of industry. At the same&#13;
time, domestic policy reactions are described and their effect on&#13;
specialization   discussed.     Finally,   some  qualitative   predictions&#13;
particularly relevant to trade with the developing countries and to&#13;
domestic structural adjustment will be ventured.&#13;
Chapter II presents the conceptual framework found most useful&#13;
in  analyzing   West  Germany's   comparative  advantage.     Chapter  III&#13;

considers the evidence on factor endowments, while Chapter IV presents&#13;
empirical evidence for testing comparative advantage, including detailed&#13;
investigations highlighting the continuous changes in the international&#13;
division of labor.    Chapter IV presents and discusses developments in&#13;
trade   policy  and   factor  endowments   and  their   repercussions  on&#13;
specialization.    Finally,  Chapter V crystallizes    these results and&#13;
considers the implications for the future.&#13;

THE DETERMINANTS OF SPECIALIZATION&#13;
The conceptual frameworks which have been most fruitful in&#13;
analyzing West Germany's comparative advantage are the groups of&#13;
hypotheses which emerged in international trade theory in the wake of&#13;
Leontief's-!/ empirical refutation of the until-then prevalent theory of&#13;
comparative costs framed in terms of homogeneous labor and homogeneous&#13;
capital. These sets of hypotheses constitute the neo-factor proportions&#13;
account for the commodity composition of international trade.        Still&#13;
competing with these is a looser body of theory,V the neo-technology&#13;
account of international trade structure.&#13;
The neo-factor proportions hypothesis focuses on international&#13;
differences in relative endowments of, and inter-industry differences&#13;
in, the intensity of human capital, with the total of the knowledge,&#13;
experience and ability embodied in that human capital being treated as&#13;
an investment good yielding a return.    This wider definition of capital&#13;
was developed by Schultz and Becker and was applied to international&#13;
trade by Kenen.3/&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
It was soon recognized that human and physical capital did not&#13;
need to be either perfect substitutes or perfect complements, but rather&#13;
needed to be recognized as separate factors of production.-Y While the&#13;
operational measurement of the stock of human capital employed in each&#13;
industry was addressed from the returns side in the form of wage&#13;
differentials among skills that reflected returns on investment in human&#13;
capital,   Keesing2     suggested   focusing   directly   on   the   skill&#13;
differentials.&#13;
Both measurement concepts have proven equally successful in&#13;
explaining the commodity composition of trade in various countries. Nor&#13;
has the focus on human capital or skills been to the exclusion of other&#13;
factors which could be readily identified beyond physical capital,&#13;
3'&#13;
particularly raw materials_-&#13;
When attempting to explain changes in trade structure over&#13;
time, rather than the determinants of trade structure at a point in&#13;
time, it has proven both fruitful and convenient to approach the problem&#13;
from the cost side rather than the factor intensity side.      Divergences&#13;

in the different evolution of unit labor costs among industries go far&#13;
in explaining shifts in competitiveness.     This approach, very much in&#13;
the spirit of Ricardo,A/ derives its justification -- and explanatory&#13;
power -- not so much from the a priori relevance of a labor theory of&#13;
value  per se, but from two other sources.         One is that it is an&#13;
empirical phenomenon that the cost of labor is a very large share of the&#13;
total cost in manufacturing industries in developed country locations.&#13;
Second, relative factor intensities have to differ quite radically among&#13;
industries to make the marginal rate of transformation of the output of&#13;
one industry into another deviate much from approximate constancy.-/&#13;
Apparently, factor intensities among manufacturing industries do not&#13;
differ sufficiently to obviate the usefulness of a pure labor cost&#13;
approach.&#13;
A distinctly different approach to explaining the inter-&#13;
industry structure of trade which also emerged in the wake of Leontief's&#13;
results focuses on more particular aspects or characteristics of goods&#13;
and production processes than those subsumable into simple production&#13;
functions.   This method of analysis is centered around the newness of a&#13;
good or its stage in a product cycle and the capability of a country to&#13;
innovate.  It was begun by Posner3/ and conforms to the spirit of the&#13;

expenditures were devised to measure the stage of an industry's typical&#13;
product  in  the   life  cycle.2!    In  addition,   other  features  were&#13;
recognized as crucial in determining trade structure, such as dynamic&#13;

results have failed to establish which theory is superior in explaining&#13;
the commodity composition of international trade, nor has an integratted&#13;
account emerged as of yet. As the late Professor Johnson put it:&#13;
The technology theory was originally presented, in line&#13;
with the prevailing methodology of "positive economics",&#13;
empirical testing of rival hypotheses and an "adversary&#13;
procedure" in the determination of scientific truth, as a&#13;
superior alternative to the factor proportions theory;&#13;
but subsequent testing has shown that both theories, and&#13;
some   differentiated   sub-species   of   the   technology&#13;
approach, have substantial explanatory power but not&#13;
sufficiently commanding power to dispose conclusively of&#13;
rival claimants.   This is not really surprising, and in&#13;
fact a predictable consequence of the artificiality of&#13;
the rival-hypothesis-testing approach../&#13;
Nevertheless, when taken by themselves, the direction of each&#13;
of the variables specified by the theories has been well-researched and&#13;
tentatively established. Hence, it seems appropriate that both the neo-&#13;
factor proportions and the neo-technology theories have continued in use&#13;
as organizing frameworks for empirical research on the international&#13;
trade structure of West Germany.&#13;
One crucial issue which has been relatively neglected in t:he&#13;
case of the neo-factor proportions hypothesis is the precise measurement&#13;
of and concomitant test for the relevance of a country's relative&#13;
endowment of human and physical capital and of natural resources.       In&#13;
the case of the neo-technology hypothesis, a country's capacity or&#13;
propensity to innovate relative to its trading partners has been&#13;
neglected.   The great bulk of the effort has instead been spent on&#13;
measuring and testing the characteristics of goods or industries, rather&#13;

Advanced   Country's   Viewpoint,"  Journal   of   World  Trade   Law&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
than on the characteristics of countries.     This lack of precision did&#13;
not prove deleterious when the empirical tests were carried out for&#13;
countries which fell rather surely at the extreme ends of the scale of&#13;
relative factor endowments, such as the United States and India.1/&#13;
However, for countries not at the extremes of relative factor endowments&#13;
or propensities to innovate, precise measurement of these magnitudes&#13;
would seem to be a prerequisite for making predictions about the inter-&#13;
industry structure of their foreign trade. This problem is found in the&#13;
early work on Japan and West Germany.&#13;
The shortcut which has generally been used is to associate the&#13;
specified national characteristics monotonically with the country's&#13;
relative per capita    income position.    Thus the stock of human and&#13;
physical capital relative to unskilled labor tends to rise with&#13;
increasing per capita income, as has been empirically demonstrated by&#13;
Krueger../ While still less systematic evidence has been accumulated on&#13;
the relationship between innovativeness and per capita income, generally&#13;

Pattern   of   Foreign   Trade,"   Indian   Economic   Review,   N.S.&#13;
2(2)(October 1967):117-142 for India.    Even here, whether India is&#13;
a net exporter of total capital (physical plus human) is quite&#13;
sensitive to the assumed return to human capital.&#13;

Among Countries," The Economic Journal 78(311)(September 1968):&#13;
641-659.   This still leaves the relationship between physical and&#13;
human capital, as well as the relationship between raw materials&#13;
and all other factors, open. Nonetheless, this approach has proved&#13;
fruitful.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
researchers have assumed that a monotonically increasing relationship&#13;
exists there as well.-Y&#13;
For all that, the per capita income measurements used have&#13;
been based on exchange rate conversions of national currencies, with&#13;
their well-known bias of under-representing the output of poorer&#13;
countries.    More   importantly  for  present  purposes,   exchange  rate&#13;
fluctuations induced in the short run by monetary disturbances have made&#13;
the assessment of relative factor endowments subject to the vagaries of&#13;
a particular base year.&#13;
An alternative is to use purchasing power parities for a&#13;
substantial number of countries2/ and estimates of real GDP per capita&#13;
for a still larger number of countries23      They permit a more accurate&#13;
assessment of the relative factor endowments among countries.&#13;

theory   to  apply   only   to  the   United   States,  the   country&#13;
unequivocally at the top of the per capita income span during the&#13;
1960s (oral communication with the author, 1981).&#13;

Chapter III&#13;
ASPECTS OF WEST GERMANY'S RELATIVE FACTOR ENDOWMENT&#13;
Following convention, a rough attempt is made to gauge West&#13;
Germany's relative factor endowment on the basis of comparisons of per&#13;
capita  income.    Here,  however,  the value   of  the various   national&#13;
currencies has been converted by their corresponding purchasing powers&#13;
rather than by exchange rates.&#13;
The data in Table 2 show that West Germany improved its&#13;
relative income position vis-a-vis the United States, but for many time&#13;
periods the improvement was actually far less than is indicated by&#13;
comparisons  based  on  exchange rates.     Only Japan has been and is&#13;
catching up rapidly.    Hence, it appears legitimate to infer that West&#13;
Germany is among those countries most highly endowed with capital&#13;
(physical and human), though not as highly as the United States.&#13;
The country's positive relative endowment in relation to the&#13;
developing countries is of course undoubted.     More important, however,&#13;
is that a combination of some relatively rapid growth by the developing&#13;
countries, and hence a relatively rapid rate of capital accumulation,&#13;
together   with   the  pursuit   of  more   outward-oriented   development&#13;
strategies, tended to allow those countries to expand their exports of&#13;
labor-intensive goods to the world markets, including West Germany.&#13;
A certain idiosyncrasy in the evolution of West Germany's&#13;
relative factor endowments is worth pointing out for the impact it might&#13;
have had on the structure of its international trade.       Throughout the&#13;
1960s and into the early 1970s, essentially the whole of Europe was&#13;
relevant to West Germany as a labor market. Indeed, immigrant labor was&#13;

employed at increasing rates until 1973, when the "guest worker stop"&#13;
was promulgated.    Since a substantial share of those employees came&#13;
without their families, the per capita income figures for West Germany&#13;
may be upwardly biased.    In addition, the foreign workers tended to be&#13;
less skilled on the average than their German counterparts.     Hence, the&#13;
skill structure of West Germany might have been skewed increasingly&#13;
downward.&#13;
These observations suggest the hypothesis that West Germany&#13;
should have enjoyed a comparative advantage at least vis-a-vis the&#13;
developing country activities which were:&#13;
o    Intensive in their use of human capital or human&#13;
skills,&#13;
o    Intensive in their use of physical capital, and&#13;
o    Highly innovative and producing new goods.&#13;
In addition, as West Germany may plausibly be classified as a&#13;
resource-poor country, it probably suffered a comparative disadvantage&#13;
in resource-intensive activities where those resources were expensive to&#13;
trade.&#13;

THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE AND TESTS OF TRADE THEORIES&#13;
Cross-Industry Analyses&#13;
The early work on West Germany's comparative advantage focused&#13;
on the Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson Theorem -- the objective was to test&#13;
whether a country was indeed a net exporter of capital based upon the&#13;
endowment considerations outlined."/     After allowing for the existence&#13;
of human capital, this indeed proved to be the case in West Germany.2/&#13;
With the advent of new suppliers of manufactures on world&#13;
markets, interest shifted to predicting those activities that would be&#13;
endangered in highly developed countries.3/       To attack this problem,&#13;
Fels4/ regressed net exports per employee by industry on a measure of&#13;
total   capital   intensity    for   West   Germany's   trade   with   both&#13;
industrialized   and  developing  countries   for  1962  and   1969.    The&#13;

Economic Research Studies in International Relations, No. 4, New&#13;
York:   Columbia University Press, 1968).      It is not the same as&#13;
testing the Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson Theorem, but is appropriate&#13;
for asking what the least-cost locations are for what kinds of&#13;
industries, as pointed out by R. E. Baldwin, "Determinants of the&#13;
Commodity Structure of U.S. Trade," The American Economic Review&#13;
61(1)(March 1971):126-146.&#13;

hypothesis that West Germany enjoyed international competitiveness,&#13;
particularly   in   the  (total)   capital-intensivel/   industries,   was&#13;
confirmed in all cases, but it apparently performed better for trade&#13;
with the developing countries, reflecting the relative differences in&#13;
the factor endowments of the two regions.&#13;
In a subsequent article, Fels2/ did not aggregate physical and&#13;
human capital, but left them as separate factors.       Surprising results&#13;
were achieved: the hypothesis that a high human capital intensity would&#13;
mean that a location in West Germany was advantageous for an industry&#13;
was confirmed, while the hypothesis that a high physical capital&#13;
intensity would do so, was not.    That latter variable appeared with an&#13;
unexpectedly significant negative sign, a result that has been&#13;
replicated frequently.&#13;
Thus, a sort of Leontief Paradox re-emerged, along with&#13;
several more or less plausible rationalizations for this result. One is&#13;
based on distortions in the developing countries, for it has been&#13;
observed that:&#13;
1/   Fels also introduced a novel measuring concept for human capital,&#13;
in which the difference between the average wage and an unskilled&#13;
worker's wage is regarded as a return on human capital.         Thus,&#13;
inter-industry differences in the disutility of labor are not&#13;
counted as returns to human capital.     The return on human capital&#13;
(10 percent) was taken from an independent source -- K. D.&#13;

Education and Incomes], in Theoretische und empirische Beitrage zur&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

In fourteen of the fifteen [developing] countries under&#13;
study, the cost of labour was artificially raised by&#13;
minimum wages, social security charges, restrictive job-&#13;
tenure legislation, and severence pay regulations.     The&#13;
cost of using capital - the factor in relatively short&#13;
supply - was artificially reduced below its scarcity&#13;
value by a combination of preferential treatment of&#13;
imported capital equipment and special incentives...,&#13;
which   were    usually   linked   to   the    amount   of&#13;
investment.l/&#13;
The  second   rationalization  is   based  on  distortions   in&#13;
industrialized countries, in particular West Germany.     These countries&#13;
have also discriminated among their industries; a preferred tool of&#13;
their industrial policy has been privileged access to the capital&#13;
markets for declining industries, including those suffering at the hands&#13;
of competition from developing countries.    Thus, the negative sign on&#13;
the physical capital coefficient may reflect causality running from low&#13;
international competitiveness to special physical capital subsidies to&#13;
increased physical capital intensity over and above that which would&#13;
prevail at uniform    relative  factor prices.-"     Indeed, a   Spearman&#13;
coefficient of rank correlation between physical capital intensity and&#13;
total effective protection, i.e., including domestic subsidies, attains&#13;

effective rate of protection variable included in one of Fels' (op.&#13;

notably in the work on the World Bank's Market Penetration Project,&#13;
of which this paper is a part.&#13;

significant result.&#13;
Rounding   out   the  tests   of  the   neo-factor   proportions&#13;
2/&#13;
variables, Wolter-/ tested the additional influence of raw material&#13;
intensity on the structure of West Germany's trade with developing&#13;
countries. The expected negative influence of that variable (defined as&#13;
the ratio of exports to imports, by branch of industry) on competitive-&#13;
ness was indeed confirmed at a high level of statistical significance.&#13;
All in all, then, the neo-factor proportions approach goes far&#13;
to explain the structure of West Germany's competitiveness.       However,&#13;
the main burden of explanation is being carried by the human capital&#13;
intensity of industries alone, both in relation to the developing&#13;
countries and, somewhat less satisfactorily, to the industrialized&#13;
countries. The precise influence which physical capital exerts on the&#13;
structure of comparative advantage has not yet been cleared up.&#13;

Technological hypotheses for explaining trade structure were&#13;
extensively tested by Horn.I/      He did so not only for West German&#13;
industry, but also in international cross--sectional analyses that&#13;
related the relative net exports of R&amp;D-intensive industries to per&#13;
capita GDP, as a measure of the level of development, which in l-urn&#13;
presumably was an indicator of the innovativeness of a country.-         A&#13;
significant positive relationship emerged in a host of industries,&#13;
including chemicals, pharmaceuticals and aircraft, but not in electrical&#13;
machinery or road vehicles.-3 In contrast, in a cross-industry analysis&#13;
for West Germany, relative net exports were well-explained by R&amp;D-&#13;
intensity, measured in various ways.     Subsequent work-/ which subsumed&#13;
various measures of scale economies under the neo-technology hypothesis&#13;

3/   Op. cit., Horn, pp. 270-278.      These results are consistent with&#13;
subsequent industry studies (see below, p. 31) and cast some doubt&#13;
on at least the R&amp;D proxy for measuring a good's place in the&#13;
product cycle.    Similar results were obtained by R. Dick and H.&#13;
Dicke ("Patterns of Trade in Knowledge," in H. Giersch, ed.,&#13;

TUbingen:    J.C.B.  Mohr  (Paul  Siebeck),  1979)  for  the service&#13;
sector.   The international location of some "knowledge"-intensive&#13;
services can be explained by per capita income differences, but&#13;
others cannot.   Presumably, trade barriers play a much more severe&#13;
role here than in the bulk of manufacturing, as the authors point&#13;
out.&#13;

tended to confirm these results, although the tests of scale economies&#13;
proper remained ambiguous.&#13;
To clear up the relationship between these two competing&#13;
theories   of  the  determinants   of   comparative  advantage,   Wolterl/&#13;
conducted   a  formal   empirical   test,  asking   whether   each  theory&#13;
contributed additional explanatory power to that of the other. The neo-&#13;
factor proportions variables were human and physical capital intensity&#13;
and raw material intensity; the neo-technology variables included&#13;
innovativeness (proxied by R&amp;D expenditures relative to sales) and scale&#13;
economies   (the   share  of   each   industry's   employees  working   in&#13;
particularly large plants).&#13;
For West Germany's trade structure as a whole, neither&#13;
hypothesis dominated the other, i.e., each offered some independent&#13;
explanatory power.     However,  in relation   to  trade with   developing&#13;
countries, the neo-factor proportions hypothesis dominated, i.e., the&#13;
technology variables added no independent explanatory power.-V        This&#13;
finding reconfirmed the crucial role of human capital intensity in&#13;
north-south trade.&#13;
Interestingly enough, the conceptual framework applied thus&#13;
far has also proven fruitful in analyzing West Germany's trade with the&#13;
centrally planned economies. Two hypotheses were originally advanced by&#13;

capital and hence over-export physical capital-intensive commodities;&#13;
and planned economies, because of centralization, prefer standardized&#13;
goods over new goods.    Pursuing these hypotheses, Weiss and Wolter and&#13;
Weiss2/ have shown that West Germany indeed enjoyed a competitive edge&#13;
in  human   capital-intensive   industries   vis-a-vis  those   economies.&#13;
Although   some  evidence   also   tended  to   support  the   Eucken  and&#13;
Kindleberger hypotheses, more remarkable was the great similarity of&#13;
results of these tests to those involving trade with the market&#13;
economies.    Generally,  however,   there is somewhat more unexplained&#13;
variation in competitiveness vis-a-vis the centrally planned economies.&#13;
Given the high level of consistency of the results obtained&#13;
for West Germany for different points in time, an attempt is made here&#13;
to replicate the description and analysis for a more recent period, as&#13;
well as to test the influence of disaggregating human capital into more&#13;
skill classes or skill types.    The reason for this approach is that the&#13;
hypotheses have been advanced that West Germany's competitiveness in&#13;

certain sectors such as the engineering industries has been determined&#13;
by the availability and cheapness of particular kinds of skilled&#13;
workers, namely craftspeople.L/&#13;
Following Liesner and Balassa,2/ the competitiveness of an&#13;
industry was measured as a variant of "revealed comparative advantage"&#13;
(RCA):&#13;
RCAi   =   In (xij/mij)/(Zxij/Emij)&#13;
where xii and mij are exports and imports of the ith good to the jth&#13;
region respectively.    The inclusion of imports in a ratio formulation&#13;
precludes the need for further scaling by industry size, while avoiding&#13;
the biases inherent in other scaling devices.      The logarithmic trans-&#13;
formation lends the measure unboundedness from below.        Finally, the&#13;
summation over manufacturing industries is a descriptive device only.&#13;
The results of the calculations are shown in Tables 3a and 3b&#13;
for West Germany's trade with the world as a whole and with the&#13;
developing countries for two aggregations of manufacturing corresponding&#13;
to  the  availability  of   data  for  the  independent  variables.    The&#13;
measurement concepts for those variables were straightforward:&#13;
1/   This, in turn, might be explained by the nature of the educational&#13;
system in West Germany.    That would, however, require a separate&#13;
study.&#13;

o   Human  capital  intensity   (HCI) was  measured   using&#13;
Fels' concept of the difference between average&#13;
hourly earnings and an unskilled worker's earnings,&#13;
broken out by industry.    A 10 percent discount rate&#13;
was  applied   to   arrive  at   the  stock  of   human&#13;
capital.L/&#13;
o   Physical    capital    intensity    (PCI)    was    the&#13;
undepreciated stock of fixed assets per employee man-&#13;
hour at its replacement value;&#13;
o   Raw material intensity (RMI) was the value of the&#13;
primary sector inputs per person in each industry.&#13;
O   Unskilled  labor  intensity (UNS) was    the share of&#13;
employees in each industry doing "repetitive tasks&#13;
requiring less than six months training on the&#13;
job."2/&#13;
o   Craftsperson   intensity   (CMI)  was   the  share   of&#13;
employees in each industry who "have completed a&#13;
1/  Since every earnings flow is multiplied by a factor of 10, the&#13;
inter-industry structure of human capital remains unaffected.&#13;
Applying the discount rate does allow a very rough comparison&#13;
of the relative stocks of human and physical capital utilized,&#13;
however.&#13;

o   Innovativeness (R&amp;D), as proxied by R&amp;D expenditures&#13;
per employee;&#13;
o Scale economies (SCE), as proxied by the average&#13;
employment per plant. This proxy is perhaps the most&#13;
questionable,   but    Stigler's2/  survival  principle&#13;
cannot be used because of data limitations.&#13;
Three sets of regressions were run:     two for the neo-factor&#13;
proportions approach, of which one used the wage differentials concept&#13;
of human capital, the other the skill concept; and one for the neo-&#13;
technology approach.    Each set of regressions was run once for trade&#13;
with the developing countries and once for total trade. The results are&#13;
shown in Table 4.&#13;
The results were generally in accord with expectations and&#13;
with the results of previous studies, though not in all aspects.       The&#13;
neo-factor proportions hypothesis in the form of human capital intensity&#13;
did the best in explaining the trade structure, both in trade with the&#13;
total world (equation 1) and with the developing countries (equation&#13;
2). The human capital variable showed the expected sign and was greater&#13;
in absolute value for trade with the developing countries, as was&#13;

expected from the relative factor endowments.        Once again, physical&#13;
capital intensity was significant with an unexpected sign,-/ and though&#13;
the raw material intensity was not significant, the sign was as&#13;
expected.&#13;
Disaggregating human capital into skill classes materially&#13;
altered the results (equations 3 and 4). While the overall explanatory&#13;
power of the regressions was reduced, only one variable, craftspeople&#13;
intensity,  carried  the burden   of  explanation.    At  the  same  time,&#13;
physical capital became insignificant, losing its perverse sign.&#13;
It  is   noteworthy   that  a  medium-skilled   group  such   as&#13;
craftspeople should exert such a significantly positive influence on&#13;
competitiveness  vis-a-vis   poorer  countries.     If  it  is  true  that&#13;
craftspeople are cheaper to educate than more highly skilled personnel,&#13;
or put differently, if the rate of return on such an education is very&#13;
high in the developing countries, then the structure of West Germany's&#13;
competitiveness vis-a-vis those countries is likely to continue to&#13;
change dramatically or, barring that, to be locked into industrial&#13;
1/   If petroleum products are omitted, the coefficient loses signifi-&#13;
cance  (regression   not  shown).    Petroleum  refining   is  highly&#13;
physical capital-intensive, but its international competitiveness&#13;
is low in Germany.    The proximate cause for observed competitive-&#13;
ness is the proximity of Rotterdam, where much refining is done for&#13;
Germany.   The attractiveness of Rotterdam for petroleum refining&#13;
activities lies in the nodal nature of that port:       crude oil is&#13;
refined where modes of transportation are changed if the change&#13;
occurs near the product market. This industry is a good example of&#13;
the consequences of the dangers of ignoring transport costs in&#13;
international trade theory.    In the language of location theory,&#13;
traditional   trade   theorems   would  hold   only   for   footloose&#13;
industries.&#13;

activities destined to suffer declining relative prices on the world&#13;
markets.&#13;
These results do, however, seem to be generally consistent&#13;
with West Germany's relative per capita income position as measured by&#13;
the purchasing power calculation, when taken as an indicator of relative&#13;
factor endowments.&#13;
Finally, the technology hypothesis performed less well than&#13;
heretofore, though this may have related crucially to the inadequacy of&#13;
the proxies. Viewed from the vantage point of the developing countries,&#13;
if West Germany is at all typical of an industrialized country in terms&#13;
of the determinants of its competitiveness, a wider range of goods would&#13;
seem to be candidates for efficient specialization on their part than&#13;
heretofore thought.&#13;
Even at *the level of aggregation suitable! for broad cross&#13;
industry studies, inspection of the data on the structure of competiti-&#13;
veness (Table 3a) indicates the broad range of activities in which West&#13;
Germany has come under competitive pressure at the hands of the&#13;
developing countries.     Aside from the by-now traditional manufactured&#13;
exports of these countries, such as clothing and textiles, leather and&#13;
leather goods, shoes, musical instruments, sporting goods and toys, the&#13;
developing countries have gained competitiveness in a host of raw&#13;
material-intensive products, such as non-ferrous metal products, lumber,&#13;
wood  products,   paper,  and  paper  products.     Both  these  groups   of&#13;
commodities include goods at various stages of processing.&#13;
Even more telling were the still positive, but relatively low,&#13;
RCA values for goods which were presumably technology-intensive, such as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
electrical engineering, office and data processing equipment, and&#13;
precision mechanics, optics and clocks.&#13;
The overall picture that emerges, then, is one of *a quite&#13;
broad-based international division of labor between West Germany and the&#13;
developing   countries,  spanning   all  manufacturing   industries.     Put&#13;
differently,   in   their   trade   with  industrialized    countries,   the&#13;
developing countries no longer specialize almost exclusively in a highly&#13;
standardized   production   technology,   perhaps  drawing   upon  whatever&#13;
domestic raw materials happen to be available.&#13;
The impression that trade between the developing countries and&#13;
the industrialized countries, and not just West Germany, is more varied&#13;
in terms of the characteristics of the products being exchanged than is&#13;
sometimes supposed was confirmed by Loertscher's and Wolter' s/ explicit&#13;
test of the Linder hypothesis in a simultaneous cross-industry, cross-&#13;
country framework that focused on intra-industry rather than inter-&#13;
industry trade..!-/  They found that intra-industry trade increased when&#13;
the differences in per capita income among countries declined; indeed,&#13;
the more differentiated the product group, the greater that increase&#13;
was. This increase in the trade of like goods over time was confirmed&#13;

Grubel and P. T. Lloyd (Intra InduFtry Trade, New York: Wiley,&#13;

likely to occur, while I. B. Kravis and R. E. Lipsey (Price&#13;
Competitiveness   in World Trade,   New York:     Columbia University&#13;
Press, 1971) suggest some specific attributes of the goods,&#13;
especially for electrical and non-electrical machinery, in which&#13;
particular countries are likely to be competitive.&#13;

for West Germany in Fels and Schmidt.1/    Hence, the kinds of goods that&#13;
developing countries can export efficiently should be viewed more as a&#13;
continuum through which poorer, growing countries pass, rather than as&#13;
given once and for all.&#13;
Industry Studies&#13;
The overall results presented thus far are consistent with a&#13;
number of the more detailed industry studies undertaken for West&#13;
Germany.   Besides pinpointing the competitive or uncompetitive product&#13;
lines more   precisely,  these  studies  have  shed  additional  light  on&#13;
particular problems, in some cases by advancing novel measurement&#13;
concepts. In addition to covering industries which have long been under&#13;
competitive pressure from the developing cotntries, industries with a&#13;
still relatively strong competitive position were also analyzed, leading&#13;
to sometimes surprising results.&#13;
The by now traditional sector of manufactured exports fromi the&#13;
developing   countries -- textiles   and clothing -- has been extensively&#13;

studied for West Germany.I'       Events have shown    that the developing&#13;
countries have provided these industries with favorable locational&#13;
conditions, but when those countries began to specialize in those goods,&#13;
it was still questioned whether they would be successful. 2/         In any&#13;
case, a particularly wide variety of evidence and methods has been&#13;
brought to bear on this issue:&#13;
(1)   Using per capita income as a proxy for relative&#13;
factor endowments, it was shown -/ that, initially,&#13;
when development levels are low, the share of the&#13;
value added in manufacturing of both the textile&#13;
and clothing industries rises, but then falls&#13;
after  a "critical"   level   is  attained.   This&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
situation suggests a competitive disadvantage for&#13;
highly developed countries.&#13;
(2)   Within West Germany, those industries as a whole&#13;
and all their sub-industries rank substantially&#13;
below the industry-wide average in human capital&#13;
intensity; indeed, competitiveness vis-a-vis the&#13;
developing countries as measured by an RCA concept&#13;
has been declining almost continuously since the&#13;
early  1960s.-I/   Further,  consistent  with   this&#13;
evidence, unit labor costs have been growing far&#13;
more rapidly in the clothing industry and its sub-&#13;
industries than in industry as a whole.&#13;
At least equally as important from the point of view of the&#13;
developing countries is the world market income elasticity of demand for&#13;
these goods, as it has often been feared that developing country&#13;
specialization in these sectors must lead to rapidly declining relative&#13;
prices.   Regressing the logarithm of apparent consumption of textiles&#13;
and clothing per capita on the logarithm of income per capita in an&#13;
international cross-section, Scharrer found that the world income&#13;
elasticity of demand for textiles was indee!d less than one, but the&#13;
1/   Op. cit., Dicke, et al.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
corresponding figure for clothing was 1.4, i.e., it was rather income&#13;
elastic for the world as a whole.I/&#13;
The picture is not much different on the supply side of the&#13;
leather goods and shoe industries, where declining competitiveness vis-&#13;
a-vis the developing countries has gone hand-in-hand with rates of&#13;
increase in unit labor costs which have been substantially above the&#13;
overall industrial average.-/    In addition, in a heterogenous industry&#13;
such as precision mechanics, optics and clocks, the developing countries&#13;
have also been able to make inroads.      Ophthamalic goods, photographic&#13;
equipment, projection equipment, and clocks and watches are all below&#13;
average   in   human   capital   intensity,   and  most   have   exhibited&#13;
substantially rising relative unit labor costs.    As a result, they have&#13;
been vulnerable   to  competition  from  low wage   countries.    So far,&#13;
precision mechanics, which is as human capital-intensive as the industry&#13;
average, has not been affected.&#13;
Thus, the detailed investigations show that the international&#13;
division of labor between developing and industrialized countries is by&#13;
no means limited, or limited any longer, to a small number of items&#13;
concentrated  in a few    industries.   Even in the steel industry, an&#13;
industry that produces largely homogeneous products (though on such a&#13;
1/   Op. cit., Scharrer.   Admittedly, reversible functional forms gave a&#13;
better fit, with elasticity declining after a certain per capita&#13;
income was reached.    However, here it is to be expected that the&#13;
relative prices of these two goods are positively correlated with&#13;
per capita income on account of the high nominal protection in&#13;
relatively   rich   countries.      Hence,  if   anything,   Scharrer&#13;
underestimates the relevant income elasticities.&#13;

large scale that the benefits of scale have often been thought to&#13;
overcompensate the disadvantages of changing relative factor prices),&#13;
some newcomers have been able to expand their share of the world market&#13;
significantly:1 /&#13;
(1)   In  an  international   cross-section  analysis,   a&#13;
country's share in the world market for steel&#13;
rises as development proceeds, though only until a&#13;
"critical" level is reached;&#13;
(2)   The size of the market as measured by population&#13;
does matter, suggesting the existence of economies&#13;
of scale; and&#13;
(3)   The apparent per capita consumption of steel grows&#13;
significantly faster than per capita income&#13;
itself.&#13;
For steel, the picture is a bit more differentiated than that&#13;
for other industries, with scale appearing to play an important role.&#13;
The scale factor serves to restrict efficient specialization to       Large&#13;
countries when there are trade barriers. However, once again the belief&#13;
that industries suitable for developing country specialization are&#13;
limited to those faced by only slowly growing world market demand is&#13;
contravened.&#13;

Wolter 1 also showed that a more preciseqappraisal of the bulk&#13;
of an industry's stage in the product life cycle or, perhaps better in&#13;
the case of steel, in the process life cycle can be more successful in&#13;
explaining international competitiveness than when R&amp;D intensity is&#13;
used.   When the change in a country's world market share of steel&#13;
exports is regressed on the change in that country's share of steel&#13;
produced by the basic oxygen process, significant positive results are&#13;
obtained.   However, as Wolter noted, the advances in steel production&#13;
technology (direct reduction) that have occurred since the adoption of&#13;
the oxygen process may shift the comparative advantage away from large&#13;
countries.&#13;
The engineering industries -- mechanical and electrical&#13;
engineering, automobiles and metal fabrication -- have long been&#13;
activities in which West Germany has enjoyed a competitive edge.&#13;
Correspondingly, they have attracted a substantial share of total&#13;
employment. However, as the competition from developing country exports&#13;
began to intensify throughout the 1970s in those industries, detailed&#13;
analyses that reflected the heterogeneity of the engineering industries&#13;
were undertaken to predict which product lines or sub-industries would&#13;
be relatively safe from that competition and hence would be candidates&#13;
for future employment expansion.&#13;
Once again, the conceptual framework which has enjoyed a&#13;
modicum of success in explaining West Germany's overall trade patterns&#13;

was   applied  to   the  four  industries.-Y     To   obtain  sufficiently&#13;
disaggregated data for such an undertaking, some reliance had to be&#13;
placed on industry sources, especially relative to the determinants of&#13;
trade structure.    These were obtained using a sample survey of West&#13;
German engineering enterprises.    In the end, the engineering sector was&#13;
broken down into about 50 sub-industries, permitting the tests of the&#13;
hypotheses to be conducted at a relatively disaggregated level. In&#13;

addition, the use of a sample survey permitted tests of hypotheses which&#13;
heretofore had not been tested.&#13;
It should be pointed out that at least as far as the&#13;
engineering sector is concerned, disaggregation by commodity is&#13;
important both descriptively and analytically.    While at the beginning&#13;
of the 1970s the four industries as a whole seemed not to be suffering&#13;
unduly from increasing foreign competition, numerous sub-industries were&#13;
being hit hard by the new sources of supply. They included hand tools,&#13;
electrical appliances, electric lighting fixtures, low voltage fittings,&#13;
non-electric heating devices, cutlery, miscellaneous manufactures of&#13;
metal, locks, and bicycles, especially bicycle parts, as well as radio&#13;
and TV receivers, which had been under competitive pressure from the&#13;
developing countries for some time.&#13;
Some surprising results were achieved from the analysis. R&amp;D&#13;
intensity fared uniformly poorly, with human capital intensity faring&#13;
only somewhat better, and then only in explaining the trade with&#13;
developing countries in the four sets of industry studies. In contrast,&#13;
the more specific skill measures achieved better results.        This was&#13;
particularly true of mechanical engineering, in which the craftspeople&#13;
intensity explained the structure of competitiveness vis-a-vis both the&#13;
developing countries and the total world.- A similar finding held for&#13;
the electrical engineering industry, in which unskilled labor explained&#13;
the competitiveness in trade with developing countries when human&#13;
capital intensity could not.     Apparently, the West German electrical&#13;

engineering industry, faced with an elastic supply of foreign workers,&#13;
especially unskilled, low paid female workers,L/ expanded into lines of&#13;
activity destined for efficient specialization on the part of the&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
Fabricated metal products were somewhat paradoxical in their&#13;
foreign trade, registering declining competitiveness in trade with the&#13;
developing countries, as was to be expected by their below average human&#13;
capital  intensity.    At the same time, however,     the level of their&#13;
competitiveness  remained   rather high.    Drawing   on the  thinking  of&#13;
L8sch2/ and other location theorists, it was hypothesized-3 that this&#13;
industry had benefitted from being located in an industrial complex,&#13;
from which it was able to get cheap inputs, especially steel. However,&#13;
West Germany was losing its competitive edge in these inputs.&#13;
This hypothesis was successfully tested by regressing the&#13;
proximity of metal manufacturing to each other manufacturing industry on&#13;
a measure of regional agglomeration and on the vector of the input&#13;
coefficients of the metal fabrication industry.    It was shown that this&#13;
industry, aside from profiting from the general advantages of&#13;
agglomeration, was input- rather than output-oriented, with steel as the&#13;
key input.   However, the German price for steel was continuously rising&#13;
relative to imported steel prices.     Hence, the protection policies at&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

the EC level in favor of steel would have tended to discriminate&#13;
particularly heavily against metal fabrication and to have lent the&#13;
developing countries a still stronger competitive edge, since, on the&#13;
basis of factor requirements alone, the developing countries offered the&#13;
most advantageous location for the industry.&#13;
Significant for developing country specialization is that&#13;
world demand -- and it is world demand that is relevant - for most of&#13;
the goods in these sectors is more income elastic that for all&#13;
manufactured goods   on the average.      This was shown for mechanical&#13;
engineering, metal fabrication and electrical engineering by regressing&#13;
apparent consumption on per capita GDP in an international cross-&#13;
sectional analysis and for consumer electrical engineering and road&#13;
vehicles using household data.    Hence, the developing countries are by&#13;
no means damned to specialize in industries faced with a low income&#13;
elasticity of world demand, as has sometimes been claimed. L/&#13;
While for this heterogeneous group of industries a somewhat&#13;
richer   set  of   explanatory   hypotheses   was   required   to  explain&#13;
competitiveness, there is still a question of why the proxy for new&#13;
goods -- R&amp;D intensity -- failed.     A possible explanation lies in the&#13;
inadequacy of R&amp;D measures to yield sufficient information about the&#13;
product cycle. The measures may well serve as a proxy for the degree to&#13;
which new goods are brought forth by an industry, but they perhaps do&#13;
not capture the speed with which the production of these new goods may&#13;

be imitated by producers at other locations, to say nothing of the&#13;
institutionalization   of  such  a   transfer  p-rocess  on  the  part  of&#13;
multinational  corporations.    It appears   also  that the invention or&#13;
development of a good can be separated from its initial production at&#13;
widely varying costs across industries.       Such considerations tend to&#13;
reduce the usefulness of the R&amp;D proxy, at least at the detailed&#13;
commodity   level   in  the   engineering   sector.     Furthermore,   R&amp;D&#13;
expenditures may well be used for purposes of imitating rather than&#13;
innovating.&#13;
Typically, a large number of studies has been required to&#13;
obtain the diffusion of innovation speeds in a substantial number of&#13;
sub-industries, e.g., along the lines of Tilton for semiconductors and&#13;
Hufbauer for synthetic materials.-/    Vernon and Davidson,-/ studying a&#13;
sample of 406 innovations transferred to foreign subsidiaries by 57&#13;
U.S.-based multinational enterprises over the period 1945-1975, discern&#13;
a clear trend toward more rapid technology transfer. Differences among&#13;
industries were not examined, however.     In some studies of industry in&#13;
West Germany, an attempt was instead made to use the converse of&#13;
innovativeness -- the degree of product standardization, defined as the&#13;

average (median) lot size -- as suggested by Vernon."/       This variable&#13;
was included in the survey questionnaire.&#13;
Correlating    median    lot   size    with    West    Germany's&#13;
competitiveness in engineering goods vis-a-vis the total world and&#13;
developing countries yielded quite convincing results, even when&#13;
compared with other explanations, as Table 5 shows.        The table also&#13;
confirms some of the results of the individual industry studies:&#13;
o     In relation to the developing countries, median&#13;
lot size outperformed each other variable taken&#13;
separately   and   explained   competitiveness    in&#13;
relation to the world quite well, whereas R&amp;D&#13;
intensity had been unable to do so;&#13;
o     Human   capital   intensity  and   unskilled   labor&#13;
intensity   did  equally   well,   but   both  were&#13;
outperformed by craftspeople intensity.&#13;
Hence, the measure of standardization of the median lot size reiterates&#13;
the relevance of the product cycle, or the neo-technology approach, but&#13;
the skill concept does about equally well.&#13;
This series of tests showed that the two guiding sets of&#13;
hypotheses    --   neo-factor    proportions    and   neo-technology    -&#13;
remain fruitful for goods which are highly heterogeneous in the&#13;
characteristics of their use.    More important, a focus on more precise&#13;
definitions of factors and of standardization showed that trade&#13;
structure can be explained about equally well for all West Germany's&#13;
trading partners. For the developing countries, the results tended to&#13;

imply that the particular kinds of skills invested in mattered for trade&#13;
flows.    Indeed, within engineering in the long run, West Germany's&#13;
competitive position, though still strong, seemed to depend upon a form&#13;
of human capital -- skilled craftspeople -- who may have been cheaper to&#13;
train than more highly and/or formally educated personnel.&#13;

CHAPTER V&#13;
THE INFLUENCE OF COMMERCIAL POLICY&#13;
So far, a normally significant factor in the determination of&#13;
trade flows has not been considered -- commercial policy.     It would be&#13;
expected that tariffs, quotas and other impediments to trade would leave&#13;
their mark on trade flows, for that is their expressed intention.&#13;
In spite of the protective policies pursued both in West&#13;
Germany and at the EC level, in almost none of the industries examined&#13;
so far, nor in any of the overall results, did commercial policy prevent&#13;
the outcome that would have been expected, at least in direction, based&#13;
on an application of the theory of comparative advantage in the absence&#13;
of trade barriers.-/     However,  if trade barriers are determined by&#13;
considerations of political expediency, there would be no a priori&#13;
reason to expect that the trade patterns resulting from the variation in&#13;
relative factor endowments across countries and over time would need to&#13;
be reversed, only ameliorated.&#13;
Indeed, calculation of the effective rates of tariff protection&#13;
and of domestic assistance in West Germany, as summarized in Table 6,&#13;
shows that only in a few instances were the total effective protection&#13;
rates extraordinarily high.      Indeed,  in the cross-industry analysis,&#13;
the  industries  that   enjoyed  the  highest   levels  of  protection   --&#13;
1/   Exceptions do appear in some narrow product lines in textiles and&#13;
clothing, but by no means are these industries affected as a whole.&#13;

may make a difference to observed trade flows whether or not commercial&#13;
policy is pursued A outrance, this in turn being a function of the&#13;
political power of the relevant interest group.&#13;
Protection did, on the other hand, influence the pattern of&#13;
resource use even in those industries which were highly protected,&#13;
through less protected than food and agriculture.         In general,  the&#13;
highly protected industries resorted to a strategy of&#13;
o    Capital   intensification    more   rapid   than   the&#13;
industry-wide average, and&#13;
o    A rationalization   of investment   greater than the&#13;
industry average.l/&#13;
This strategy allowed them to expand their share of the value added in&#13;
industry, though apparently not enough to reverse the trends of&#13;
increasing competitiveness in imports from low-wage locations.&#13;
1/ The estimates of effective tariff protection for textiles and&#13;
clothing were based on the average nominal tariff rates of 10.3 and&#13;
14.0 percent in 1972, respectively.    H. H. Glismann and A. D. Neu,&#13;
("Towards New Agreements on International Trade Liberalization,"&#13;
Weltwirtschaftliches    Archiv   107(2)(1971):   233-271),   using  an&#13;
ingenious measurement concept to estimate the tariff equivalents of&#13;
quotas, arrived at a figure of 45 percent for imports subject to&#13;
quota.  They compared the domestic price of an item subject to quota&#13;
with the price of an item highly substitutable in production and&#13;
facing similar demand conditions, but not subject to quotas.       The&#13;
difference in price is the tariff equivalent, e.g., women's blouses&#13;
(subject to quotas) and men's shirts (not subject to quotas) of&#13;
identical material and size.&#13;

These findings mean only that protection has not been severe&#13;
enough in most cases to cause that result, as studies of the food&#13;
industry-/ and of the influence of EC agricultural policy show.!/&#13;
o    The food   industry was able to maintain and even&#13;
partly improve its competitive position vis-a-vis&#13;
non-EC member countries.    Although the intervention&#13;
prices for agricultural inputs were centrally set,&#13;
they were usually at the level of the highest cost&#13;
producer, typically West Germany, so that all EC&#13;
member countries' food industries were burdened with&#13;
the   highest   input   prices.   This   limited   the&#13;
competitive pressure that even the EC countries&#13;
placed on the West German food industry.&#13;
O    For agriculture itself, while no short summary can&#13;
do justice to the byzantine price distortion and&#13;
factor misallocation systems that operated in the&#13;
EC,./ it is safe to say that the system pushed West&#13;
German production to near 90 percent of consumption&#13;
of the major agricultural products, effectively&#13;

prevented employment and output in the agricultural&#13;
sector from declining rapidly, and turned the EC&#13;
into a major net exporter of some agricultural&#13;
commodities.&#13;
Nevertheless, the principles of allocation within agriculture are fairly&#13;
clear. They may be described as the practice of Lange-Lerner socialism&#13;
guiding production and consumption by centralized price fixing,-L/ with a&#13;
government guarantee to maintain fixed prices by adding to or depleting&#13;
commodity stocks.    The influence of world market prices on domestic&#13;
prices is abrogated by a system of variable levies and subsidies&#13;
identically equal to the difference between the world and the domestic&#13;
price of each agricultural commodity../    However, in sharp contrast to&#13;
the theory of Lange-Lerner socialism, no central planning board sets&#13;
prices at the social optimum where accumulation and decumulation of&#13;
stocks are zero.   Rather, price setting reflects the political power of&#13;
organized   interest  groups,   regarding  both   the  average  price   of&#13;
agricultural commodities relative to all other commodities, and the&#13;
structure of agricultural prices.&#13;
What is important for present purposes is that the set of&#13;
institution and policy instruments applicable to the agricultural sector&#13;
in EC countries are much more encompassing than the relatively&#13;
1/ In fact, agricultural prices differ among EC member countries.&#13;
Prices are set by national governments; exchange rates among&#13;
currencies for agricultural products differ from exchange rates&#13;
applicable to international transactions with other goods.&#13;
2/ This system is reminiscent of the set of policies used in the East&#13;
European centrally planned economies to insulate the domestic price&#13;
structure from the world market price structure.&#13;

straightforward setting of more tariffs. And the available loans have&#13;
been used to pursue a protective policy a outrance which, in many cases,&#13;
has reversed individual EC countries' net import position to a net&#13;
export position for individual products.&#13;

Chapter VI&#13;
A SUMMARY APPRAISAL&#13;
All in all, certain salient features of West Germany's&#13;
competitiveness stand out in sharp relief, while others by their nature&#13;
do not. Most of the analysis of the trade flows has a direct bearing on&#13;
the chances for the exports of developing countries in the markets of&#13;
the highly industrialized countries.&#13;
It has been reasonably well-established that West Germany's&#13;
comparative  advantage  lies  in human capital-intensive    goods.    This&#13;
confirms expectations about comparative advantages vis-a-vis trade with&#13;
developing countries.   However, the kind of human capital involved may&#13;
be less skilled than commonly thought, and the range of products heavily&#13;
exported by West Germany may be more susceptible to downward price&#13;
pressures in the world markets than heretofore expected.&#13;
The role of R&amp;D in determining competitiveness is more&#13;
uncertain. In part, this uncertainty could result from the varying lags&#13;
in imitation across industries or products and in part from the widely&#13;
different costs to firms of physically separating invention from&#13;
production. Apparently, a high degree of R&amp;D activity is not sufficient&#13;
for achieving international competitiveness at a West German location,&#13;
though undoubtedly it does confer that advantage on some industries.&#13;
There is some evidence that lot size is a reliable indicator of a&#13;
product's stage in the life cycle, as there is some evidence that the&#13;
use of specific new, but tested, technologies does promote international&#13;
competitiveness at a West German location. However, the determinants of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
the length of the imitation lag, a key element in maintaining&#13;
competitiveness at high wage locations, are not: yet appreciated.&#13;
Reflecting the heterogeneity of the product characteristics&#13;
extant in manufactured products, a rich mosaic of patterns is emerging&#13;
in West Germany's trade, even in its trade with developing countries.&#13;
While a good's human capital intensity predicts well the location of its&#13;
production, the range of goods in conventional industrial classification&#13;
schemes which are suitable for developing country specialization now and&#13;
in the future is far wider than often thought.       Consistent with this&#13;
pattern is the substantial number of industries, sub-industries or&#13;
product lines facing an income elastic world market demand -- and it is&#13;
world demand which is relevant -- which are eminently suited to&#13;
developing country specialization.&#13;
Much of the focus of the analysis of West Germany's trade&#13;
patterns has been on its trade with developing countries.          This is&#13;
justified because the future structure of its trade with equally highly&#13;
or higher developed countries will in large measure be shaped by goods&#13;
which have not yet been invented.I' If such a good is to be competitive&#13;
in West Germany, it is highly probable that it will have to have a hi'gh&#13;
level of human capital intensity, although the goods cannot yet be&#13;
named.&#13;

version appears as "Competition as a Discovery Procedure" in F. A.&#13;

Ordinarily   it  would   be  expected   that   the  differential&#13;
international rates of factor accumulation would determine the future&#13;
pattern of competitiveness - i.e., the faster developing country growth&#13;
is relative to West Germany, the sooner those countries can move up the&#13;
scale of goods in human capital intensity.      In fact, however, policy&#13;
plays a crucial role.     The examples of the commercial policy toward&#13;
agriculture and the food industries in West Germany show that policy&#13;
pursued a outrance can reverse the expected and efficient pattern of&#13;
international  specialization.     However,  as  competition  from  below&#13;
intensifies, more and more industries, and hence interest groups, are&#13;
going to press for similarly effective policy measures.       At the same&#13;
time, such measures tie resources down in declining relative price&#13;
industries and prevent them from finding and moving into more efficient&#13;
activities.    Hence,   the  uncertainties  in  predicting  some  salient&#13;
features of the international division of labor lie more in the policy&#13;
sphere than in the economic sphere proper.&#13;

            The structure of international
            competitiveness in the Federal Republic of Germany : an appraisal
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In the Federal Republic of Germany, the
            1980s are likely to see a continuation of the track
            competition from developing countries and resultant
            pressures for adjustment. This paper looks at the
            determinants of West Germany's comparative advantage,
            using that information in combination with evidence about
            the evolution of factor endowments and economic policies to
            assess the likely direction of West Germany's future
            specialization, particularly with respect to developing
            countries. Finally, the role of policy in influencing West
            Germany's specialization and structural adjustment is
            discussed. This study tested the neo-factor proportions
            theory and the neo-technology theory, which have been used
            to explain Germany's comparative advantage, in light of
            more current data. The conclusions were that craftspeople
            carried the burden of explanation and that innovativeness
            and scale economies performed less well. The results also
            indicated that the developing countries are competitive with
            West Germany in a far wider range of products than was
            previously thought.
