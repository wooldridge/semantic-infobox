to a board of 24 directors. Voting power on issues brought before them is weighted according to&#13;

provide overall strategic guidance to IFC management.&#13;

                                                                                     This past fiscal year's operational results are a strong indicator that the timing&#13;

    Broad capabilities in technical assistance. As more developing nations&#13;
achieve macroeconomic stability, they are turning their attention to the challenges&#13;
of microeconomic reform, especially efforts to improve their investment climate&#13;
and to help small and medium entrepreneurs create new ventures and jobs.&#13;
Our project development facilities assist entrepreneurs in many business sectors&#13;
of "frontier" countries and regions--places with low incomes or that present&#13;
high risks for private investors. From corporate governance and supply-chain&#13;
synergies to investment climate reform, the activities funded through our&#13;
partnerships with generous donor nations are a crucial catalyst for entrepreneurial&#13;
growth, especially among small and medium enterprises. This network of&#13;
donor partnerships continues to grow, and IFC has also secured approval from&#13;
its Board for a new funding formula that will help us keep building capacity.&#13;

&#13;
                                     Through investments and technical assistance to the financial sector, IFC is addressing the&#13;
&#13;
                                     constraints to finance for smaller businesses. In Bangladesh, for example, the SouthAsia&#13;
&#13;
                                     Enterprise Development Facility is working with eight partner financial institutions to&#13;
&#13;
                                     introduce a range of new products and tools that will increase the quality and quantity of&#13;
&#13;
                                     their SME portfolio. Already, 3,000 new small and medium enterprises have access to&#13;
&#13;
                                     finance, with five of the financial institutions reporting a $50 million increase in SME term&#13;
&#13;
                                     lending over the past year. SEDF is also working with the Central Bank of Bangladesh to&#13;
&#13;
                                     provide training to about a thousand bankers in core risk areas such as credit analysis, asset&#13;

                                     and liability management, treasury functions, internal controls, and anti­money laundering.&#13;

                                     These are all issues identified by local bankers and authorities as crucial to the sustainability&#13;
&#13;
                                     of the financial sector. In combination with the Netherlands Development Finance Company&#13;

Celtel International Receives&#13;
IFC Client Leadership Award&#13;
This year IFC established an annual Client Leadership Award to recognize a highly&#13;
successful corporate client that, in line with IFC's mission, has made a significant&#13;
contribution to sustainable development. The first award goes to Celtel International B.V.,&#13;
a pan-African provider of cellular telephone services that has built a successful business&#13;
while demonstrating extraordinary development impact in its countries of operation.&#13;
    Celtel provides reliable and affordable cellular services to facilitate communication&#13;
and business within Africa and with the rest of the world. The company has invested&#13;
more than $600 million in mobile phone operating companies in 13 countries:&#13;
Burkina Faso, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo,&#13;
Gabon, Kenya, Malawi, Niger, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.&#13;
In 2003, Celtel reached 2.5 million customers, generating revenues of $446 million&#13;
and a net income of $74 million. IFC's relationship with Celtel began with a 1994&#13;
investment in Celtel Uganda, one of the group's first operating companies. IFC has&#13;
since invested in the holding company and in three other Celtel operating subsidiaries,&#13;
most recently in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia. These investments&#13;
have helped modernize networks and increase mobile phone penetration rates. They                  CELTEL&#13;

have also encouraged competition, which has led to lower tariffs and increased local&#13;
private participation in the telecommunications sector.                                                   COURTESY&#13;

markets, Celtel prides itself on its transparent dealings and on promoting the highest&#13;
standards of ethics and integrity. Celtel has helped improve health and education by&#13;
refurbishing schools and health centers, providing scholarships, supporting programs&#13;
for athletes and people with handicaps, and sponsoring the Africa Education Journalism&#13;
Award. The company has embraced HIV/AIDS as a business and community issue and&#13;
has worked with IFC Against AIDS on its HIV policy for employees and their families.&#13;
Celtel has also started a community phone initiative, installed solar panels for recharging&#13;
of phone handsets, and helped protect endangered species.&#13;

                                             on Sustainability&#13;
&#13;
                                                 An Integral Aspect of Our Business&#13;
                                                 Sustainability--attention to environmental and social issues and to corporate&#13;
                                                 governance--has become simply IFC's way of doing business. We are integrating the&#13;
                                                 Corporation's environmental, social, and governance due diligence into our core&#13;
                                                 investment functions. We are helping client companies recognize that corporate social&#13;
                                                 responsibility is a central reality of business today and not an add-on to investments.&#13;
                                                 IFC provides solutions to clients through our in-house technical expertise and our&#13;
                                                 ability to identify innovative sources of finance.&#13;
                                                    Socially responsible investors often use broad, portfolio-level screens that steer their&#13;
                                                 funds toward ventures that create public goods. IFC takes that concept one step further,&#13;
                                                 evaluating each individual investment project to ensure that it meets environmental&#13;
                                                 and social standards and scoring its potential positive impact on local communities&#13;
                                                 and developing nations. IFC puts a special emphasis on creating projects in "frontier"&#13;
                                                 sectors and countries where the creation of a vibrant private sector is most needed.&#13;
                                                    Our regional reports, beginning on p. 30, reflect the fact that environmental, social,&#13;
                                                 and governance factors have now become an integral part of IFC's business. The 2004&#13;

                                      RICHARD    standard. Following a review by IFC's Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman in 2003, this&#13;
                                                 year we began a far-reaching update of the Safeguard Policies to integrate sustainability&#13;
                                                 further into the Corporation's business. With current policies serving as a baseline for&#13;
                                                 minimum standards, the update will articulate our policy objectives and the performance&#13;
                                                 we expect of our clients on social and environmental sustainability. It will also address&#13;
                                                 key policy gaps on labor standards and health and safety.&#13;
                                                    IFC is also reviewing its Policy on Disclosure of Information. Since the last update&#13;
                                                 in 1998, procedural changes have taken place within IFC, and external expectations on&#13;
                                                 transparency of publicly owned institutions have changed. In recognition that transparency&#13;
                                                 builds trust, promotes efficiency and accountability, and enhances impact on development,&#13;
                                                 the review is addressing IFC's responsibilities for disclosure. It is also defining areas where&#13;
                                                 we expect clients to be transparent about their activities, particularly on environmental&#13;
                                                 and social aspects of projects.&#13;
                                                    The processes for these major policy updates are designed to ensure broad engagement&#13;

The Equator Principles&#13;
&#13;
Twenty-four financial institutions have now announced their commitment to the Equator Principles, a voluntary set of environmental and social guidelines&#13;
&#13;
for project finance lending, since their launch in June 2003. Based on IFC's environmental and social policies and procedures, including the Safeguard&#13;
&#13;
Policies, the principles have become the new market standard, transforming project finance on a global scale. The Equator banks are estimated to have&#13;
&#13;
arranged about 80 percent of worldwide project finance lending in calendar 2003, and more banks are expected to adopt the principles in the coming&#13;
&#13;
months. Adopters now include an emerging market bank, Unibanco of Brazil, and Eksport Kredit Fonden, Denmark's export credit agency.&#13;
&#13;
    For sponsors raising funds in the project finance market, successful loan syndications are increasingly likely to depend on compliance with the principles.&#13;
&#13;
With our policies as the foundation of the principles, IFC has a stake in ensuring that standards are well understood and implemented within each bank.&#13;
&#13;
IFC has developed a training program for Equator bank professionals and to date has trained almost 400 staff from these banks. Further tools are planned&#13;
&#13;
for the next phase of implementation as the banks gain experience.&#13;
&#13;

   sustainable development and to help define the                           experience few organizations can match, IFC is showing that attention to environmental&#13;
   future role of such investments, which represent                         and social issues is good business. In addition to the expertise provided to our core&#13;

                                                                            also works through financial intermediaries to build commercial lending and leasing&#13;
   positive contributions to sustainable development,&#13;
   but not uniformly. The stakeholder report, in                            businesses that provide capital for energy efficiency investments. The Corporation's&#13;
&#13;
   particular, suggested reforms in several areas,                          commitments to energy efficiency projects have exceeded $90 million since 1990.&#13;
&#13;
   including a greater emphasis on renewable                                In FY04, we provided advice and, in some cases, financial support from donors to&#13;
&#13;
   energy sources, more transparent reporting of                            companies on energy efficiency and cleaner production. For example, we helped a&#13;
   revenue figures, increased consultation with                             Chinese fiberboard producer reduce its trimming allowances, increasing its salable&#13;
   local stakeholders, and fuller disclosure of                             output by 6 percent. While consumption of raw material and energy remained the&#13;
   project information.                                                     same, the change is expected to increase the company's annual profits by 20 percent.&#13;
       Bank Group management presented its&#13;
   response to the review to its Board in August&#13;
   2004. The response proposed to continue&#13;
   engagement in the sector while adopting&#13;
   measures to increase developmental impact.&#13;
   This reflects strong support among developing&#13;
   countries for the Bank Group's role in ensuring&#13;
   positive developmental results from extractive&#13;
   industries, including the use of environmental,&#13;
   social, and governance safeguards. The proposed&#13;
   measures included:&#13;
&#13;
   · using explicit good governance indicators in&#13;
     assessing and designing projects&#13;
   · designing projects to ensure local communities&#13;
     and poorer people benefit&#13;
   · ensuring broad community support for projects&#13;
     before an investment decision&#13;
   · committing to at least 20 percent average growth&#13;
     annually in energy efficiency and renewable&#13;
     energy portfolio commitments, over the next&#13;
     five years&#13;
   · reducing the risk that extractive industry revenues&#13;
     will be misused by requiring disclosure of&#13;
     revenue figures and the key terms of relevant&#13;
     contracts for all large projects that benefit&#13;
     from Bank Group support&#13;
   · increasing investment in natural gas projects&#13;
&#13;
       The Board agreed with management on the&#13;
   steps necessary to move forward and will be&#13;
   monitoring implementation of these measures,&#13;
   along with management.&#13;

Innovative Investment&#13;
&#13;
IFC supports conservation of natural habitats in sectors that have an impact on biodiversity.&#13;
&#13;
Our efforts include promotion of organic agriculture and ecotourism. This year, we provided a&#13;
&#13;
$1.6 million grant from the Global Environment Facility for a private sector initiative that aims&#13;
&#13;
to conserve more than 90,000 hectares of sensitive marine and coastal habitat in the Philippines.&#13;
&#13;
The funding will be provided to the El Nido Foundation, a nonprofit organization that will&#13;
&#13;
collaborate with local communities to mitigate threats to the marine ecosystem, including illegal&#13;
&#13;
fishing, overfishing, and sedimentation. The financial sustainability of this initiative will stem from&#13;
&#13;
the Asian Conservation Company, an innovative private equity investment holding company. It&#13;
&#13;
purchases stakes in Filipino firms that are located in areas of high biodiversity and that depend&#13;
&#13;
on marine resources for their long-term sustainability. ACC has acquired majority control of the&#13;
&#13;
El Nido Resorts and will ensure that some of the revenues sustain the foundation's conservation&#13;
&#13;
work, thus providing a financial return for investors while helping preserve critical ecosystems.&#13;

    IFC also provides financing and leverages donor funds to support renewable energy and&#13;
other sustainable energy projects, especially those that commercialize new technologies.&#13;
Total IFC commitments to renewable energy projects have exceeded $765 million since&#13;
1990. In fiscal 2004, IFC supported a project that demonstrates combined use of&#13;
hydroelectric and solar energy for the first time anywhere in the world. The third-largest&#13;
electric utility in the Philippines, CEPALCO had considered increasing its fossil fuel&#13;
generation to meet growing demand. Instead, IFC provided a $4 million grant from the&#13;
Global Environment Facility to help structure an innovative solar photovoltaic project.&#13;
A new plant on the island of Mindanao will enhance the capacity of CEPALCO's&#13;
existing hydroelectric facility; the 950-kilowatt project will be the largest distributed,&#13;
grid-connected photovoltaic installation in a developing country. The project is expected&#13;
to demonstrate the commercial viability of similar photovoltaic installations for cleaner,&#13;
more sustainable energy in many parts of the world.&#13;

technical assistance grants, with a focus on cleaner production and energy efficiency&#13;
projects in Asia and Latin America.&#13;
    The Sustainable Financial Markets Facility enhances the environmental and&#13;
social impact of financial intermediaries. During FY04, it provided environmental&#13;
risk management training to staff from some 100 banks, investment funds, and&#13;
other financial institutions in developing countries.&#13;
    With a global market for carbon emissions credits set in motion by the Kyoto&#13;
Protocol, IFC has collaborated with the Dutch government in the IFC-Netherlands&#13;
Carbon Facility, which purchases carbon credits that reduce emissions of greenhouse&#13;
gases from projects in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. A similar facility for purchasing&#13;
credits from projects in Central and Eastern Europe is being developed with the&#13;
Netherlands and will be comanaged by IFC and the World Bank.&#13;
    IFC also makes funding available from the Global Environment Facility for innovative&#13;
projects with global environmental benefits, including preservation of biodiversity.&#13;

28 IFC 2004 ANNUAL REPORT&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                How Red Tape Stifles Businesses&#13;
&#13;
                                Why does it take 210 days to register a business in Angola, but only four in Puerto Rico? Why does the process&#13;
                                cost five times per capita income in Cambodia but less than 1 percent in Canada? Doing Business in 2004:&#13;
                                Understanding Regulation, a report published this year by IFC and the World Bank, offers groundbreaking research&#13;
                                that makes a complex issue accessible to the general public. It provides microeconomic data from 133 countries,&#13;
                                allowing comparisons on five key indicators of the business climate: starting a company, hiring and firing workers,&#13;
                                enforcing a contract, obtaining credit, and closing a business.&#13;
                                    Doing Business finds that poor countries regulate business in ways that are associated with less efficient government,&#13;
                                more corruption, higher unemployment, and less investment. It also maintains that best practices are transferable.&#13;
                                What works in industrial countries can work in developing countries, and innovations from developing countries can&#13;
                                be broadly replicated.&#13;
                                    The report has garnered worldwide attention and is helping aid agencies and multilateral institutions determine&#13;
                                how to allocate funds and monitor progress. Twelve countries have undertaken new regulatory reforms in the last&#13;
                                year; countries as varied as Ethiopia, Morocco, and Turkey have reduced the time and cost of starting a business by&#13;
                                more than a third as a result of this newly available data.&#13;
                                    Planned as an annual publication, Doing Business will add indicators on property titling, corporate governance,&#13;
                                and bureaucratic hassles in its 2005 report and indicators on taxes, trade, and law and order in 2006. A database of&#13;
                                indicators is online at http://rru.worldbank.org/doingbusiness.&#13;

   FIAS completed 60 advisory projects in FY04, with the largest programs in Europe&#13;
and Central Asia (17) and Asia and the Pacific (16), of which five were in the Pacific.&#13;
First-time clients included Botswana, Grenada, Malta, Seychelles, and Syria.&#13;
   This year, FIAS initiated a multiphase approach to implementation of its&#13;
recommendations to streamline administrative procedures, particularly in postconflict&#13;
countries. As part of its long-term program in Turkey, FIAS set up an Investment&#13;
Advisory Council composed of high-profile international executives to help strengthen&#13;
the country's investment climate. FIAS also integrated gender issues into its administrative&#13;
barriers project in Kenya and sponsored capacity building programs for businesswomen&#13;
in Iraq (see box, p. 60).&#13;

IFC Advisory Services&#13;
IFC Advisory Services advises governments and state-owned enterprises on the&#13;
privatization of state-owned infrastructure assets and other transactions that promote&#13;
sustainable public-private partnerships, especially in the infrastructure and social&#13;
sectors. Since 1996 the group has closed 16 such transactions worldwide, generating&#13;
over $3.2 billion in sales proceeds or concession fees. In FY04, the group worked on&#13;
15 transactions in health, mining, power, water and sanitation, solid waste, irrigation,&#13;
                                                                                                                                                           ODEBRECHT&#13;
and several sectors of transportation: airlines, airports, ports, railways, and urban transit.                                                                      OF&#13;

issues to ensure that private infrastructure arrangements meet government goals--&#13;
while still being bankable. IFC also puts a premium on transparency in transaction&#13;
design and implementation and is committed to social and environmental sustainability.&#13;
   Private investors and lenders are increasingly aware of the risks associated with&#13;
infrastructure, and bringing mandates to successful closure has become more challenging.&#13;
Advisory Services has responded by changing transaction design to integrate more&#13;
fully policy advice and implementation, as well as public and private financing. It is&#13;
also working closely with other parts of IFC and in many cases becoming involved&#13;
earlier in project development. With support from the United Kingdom's Department&#13;
for International Development and the Netherlands' Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it has&#13;
put in place a multidonor trust fund, DevCo Advisory, to support this work. DevCo&#13;
cofunds analysis of opportunities and the implementation of privatization transactions&#13;
in frontier countries.&#13;

Driving the Sustainability Agenda in East Asia&#13;
&#13;
The changes underway in East Asia are daunting, with rapid economic expansion, population growth, and&#13;
&#13;
urbanization imposing heavy demands on social and environmental resources. But managing this growth also offers&#13;
&#13;
huge business opportunities. IFC is helping private firms understand the issues, especially how raising environmental&#13;
&#13;
and social standards can improve a company's access to capital and increase its financial returns in the long term.&#13;
&#13;
This year IFC sponsored a report published by the Association for Sustainable and Responsible Investment in Asia&#13;
&#13;
that demonstrates the value of a socially responsible approach to investment. With the Financial Times, we sponsored&#13;
&#13;
a conference on sustainable business in East Asia that examined trends in sustainable practices, business benefits,&#13;
&#13;
and the role of stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
    Attention to sustainability is also integral to IFC's investments in the region. For example, a rise in domestic&#13;
&#13;
consumer awareness and the emergence of international standards are rapidly increasing East Asia's demand for&#13;
&#13;
integrated, responsible waste management. Our investment this year in Modern Asia Environmental Holdings, a&#13;
&#13;
firm operating in several countries, will support the company's waste collection, transportation, recycling, treatment,&#13;
&#13;
and disposal services for industrial and commercial clients in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. This in turn                                GUNAWAN&#13;
&#13;
will promote environmentally compliant technology and practices for collection and waste-handling, helping reduce&#13;
                                                                                                                                                            MICHAEL&#13;
pollution of the air, soil, and water, as well as incidence of related diseases. In other examples from the Philippines,&#13;

Bangladesh and Sri Lanka:&#13;
Increasing Access to Telecommunications&#13;
&#13;
IFC's investments are aiding the rapid growth in South Asia's mobile communications industry,&#13;
&#13;
with broad economic benefits. In Bangladesh, GrameenPhone was the first operator to adopt&#13;
&#13;
a mass-market, low-tariff strategy and has quickly built a subscriber base, reaching 1 million&#13;
&#13;
by the end of 2003. Other companies have followed suit. The availability of affordable, reliable&#13;
&#13;
service has increased cellular penetration from 0.1 percent in 1999 to 1.25 percent today,&#13;
&#13;
more than double the rate of fixed-line use. This growth has also spurred reforms in the&#13;
&#13;
country's telecommunications sector, including the establishment of an independent regulator.&#13;
&#13;
The company has significantly increased rural connectivity through its Village Phone program,&#13;
&#13;
in which local individuals, often supported by a microfinance loan from Grameen Bank, operate&#13;
&#13;
a pay telephone in their communities. About 50 million people benefit from cellular services&#13;
&#13;
provided through this program, which has won numerous awards as an effective model for&#13;
&#13;
increasing access to telecommunications in rural areas. It has also improved the economic&#13;
&#13;
position of women operators in these areas. IFC has been able to replicate the model in&#13;
&#13;
Uganda and is embarking on a similar initiative in Nigeria.&#13;
                                                                                                                            DIALOG&#13;
   IFC made its second investment in GrameenPhone Ltd. in 2004, a $30 million loan for                                            OF&#13;

equity investment as part of a $124 million project to build the firm's network over its first&#13;

four years of operations. The cellular phone operator is sponsored by Telenor of Norway and&#13;

Grameen Telecom, an entity established by Grameen Bank.&#13;
&#13;
   In Sri Lanka, which saw the number of mobile subscribers increase by nearly half during&#13;
&#13;
2003, IFC has invested in Dialog, the local brand name for MTN Networks. Launched in 1995&#13;
&#13;
as the fourth mobile operator in the country, Dialog reached a 50 percent market share by&#13;
&#13;
2002. Following the country's ceasefire, Dialog has increasingly focused its growth on the&#13;
&#13;
northern and eastern provinces, where telecommunications infrastructure remains weak as&#13;
&#13;
a result of the civil war. IFC's $50 million investment will support the company's expansion&#13;

plans and help it upgrade its network to offer new services.&#13;

India: Investing in Sustainable Farm Forestry Programs&#13;
&#13;
In FY04, IFC invested in Ballarpur Industries Limited (BILT), India's largest producer of&#13;
&#13;
writing and printing paper and a repeat client. While this investment supports the&#13;
&#13;
modernization and expansion of production capacity, it also furthers the development&#13;
&#13;
of the company's farm forestry program. Targeting small farmers with land unsuitable&#13;
&#13;
for other cash crops, BILT raises and distributes seedlings to the farmers at subsidized&#13;
&#13;
costs, provides free technical advice, develops high-yield tree varieties, and operates&#13;
&#13;
purchase depots to secure a fair price for the produce. This ensures that farmers receive&#13;
&#13;
a stable income despite seasonal variations in revenue. In addition, BILT has started a&#13;
&#13;
pilot program to provide the farmers in their first crop rotation with an assured buyback of&#13;
&#13;
pulpwood. The company has arranged for commercial banks to make cash disbursements&#13;
                                                                                                                    ENGLISH&#13;
&#13;
to the farmers until the crops reach maturity. The banks are paid by BILT when the&#13;
                                                                                                                           RICHARD&#13;
pulpwood is delivered to the company. Since BILT's farm forestry program began in&#13;
&#13;
2000, over 15,000 farmers have participated, spanning a combined plantation area of&#13;
&#13;
10,000 hectares. With IFC's help, BILT plans to expand its program, increasing annual&#13;
&#13;
seedling distribution to an estimated 100 million and reaching over 25,000 farmers by&#13;
&#13;
2008, ensuring that a large share of the company's raw material comes from local farmers.&#13;

Attracting strategic investors, raising funds in capital markets, increasing&#13;

are gains companies make by improving their corporate governance.&#13;
With donor support, the Private Enterprise Partnership, IFC's technical&#13;
assistance program in the former Soviet Union, helps businesses and&#13;
governments in Russia, Ukraine, and, more recently, Georgia develop&#13;
sound corporate governance practices and strengthen corporate&#13;
regulations. The goal is to build investor confidence and trust in locally&#13;
owned and managed businesses, which is essential to revitalizing&#13;
production and furthering reforms.&#13;
    Through the partnership, IFC has provided advice and training on&#13;
corporate governance to almost 2,400 companies, ranging from Russia's&#13;
major corporations in the forestry, telecommunications, and chemical&#13;
sectors to mid-size Ukrainian manufacturers and Georgian banks lending&#13;
to small businesses. In addition, 30 Russian and 34 Ukrainian universities&#13;
have launched corporate governance courses in the last year. IFC also&#13;
cooperates with local securities commissions to promote policy reform.&#13;
The partnership has also helped develop and promote corporate&#13;
governance codes in Russia and Ukraine.&#13;
    This year IFC surveyed corporate governance practices in the Russian&#13;
and Ukrainian banking sectors. The partnership will help guide the&#13;

Russia: Developing the Market for Consumer Lending&#13;
&#13;
A few years ago, Russian consumers were forced to pay in cash even when buying household appliances&#13;
and cars. Today, they can access credit just like consumers in Western markets, thanks largely to the Russian&#13;
Standard Bank, which pioneered its retail credit program in 2000.&#13;
    IFC has worked with RSB since 2001 to build Russia's consumer lending market. This year we extended&#13;
our first ruble-linked loan of $40 million to the bank. Using the offshore ruble swap market, IFC structured&#13;
the financing so that RSB can borrow funds on a revolving basis in U.S. dollars or as ruble-linked financing.&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                                           BANK&#13;
Being able to repay its loan in ruble terms enhances the bank's ability to make local currency loans to&#13;
consumer clients, thus expanding its portfolio.&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                                               STANDARD&#13;

&#13;
               for channeling wealth from natural resources toward sustainable development. This year we played a&#13;
&#13;
               crucial role in mobilizing $2.4 billion in financing from a variety of sources, including $310 million in&#13;
&#13;
               loans from IFC and 15 commercial banks, for the Azeri-Chirag-Deepwater Gunashli Phase 1 oil field, a&#13;
&#13;
               $3.2 billion project in the Caspian Sea off Azerbaijan, and the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, which will&#13;
&#13;
               run through Azerbaijan and Georgia to the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. The projects will generate&#13;
&#13;
               significant income for the three countries, while setting precedents for project financing in challenging&#13;
&#13;
               environments and encouraging transparency and engagement with local people and businesses. The&#13;
&#13;
               projects will also adhere to high environmental and social standards. IFC and the World Bank have&#13;
&#13;
               taken the lead to ensure that the countries report oil revenues fully; in Azerbaijan a fund is being set&#13;

               up to see that revenues contribute to economic development.&#13;

Southern Europe and Central Asia&#13;
STRENGTHENING BUSINESSES AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS&#13;
With the private sector growing, dynamic local businesses emerging, and interest&#13;
from foreign investors on the rise, the Southern Europe and Central Asia region is&#13;
changing rapidly. IFC's investments in the region have more than doubled within&#13;
two years, from $345 million in FY02 to $842 million in FY04, with an additional&#13;
$295 million syndicated from partner banks. This year, the financial sector remained&#13;
the focus of our strategy to enhance development of private financial institutions and,&#13;
through them, small and medium enterprises. We also increased our emphasis on private&#13;
sector investment in infrastructure at the regional and country levels. In general&#13;
manufacturing, we continued to invest in the restructuring and modernization of&#13;
previously state-owned enterprises.&#13;
    IFC continues to facilitate privatization of the region's financial sector and the&#13;
engagement of strategic foreign investors. With EBRD, we took an equity stake to&#13;
support future privatization of BCR, Romania's largest bank. IFC is also helping&#13;
the bank review its strategy and operations and improve its corporate governance&#13;
and risk management. IFC's largest equity investment in a bank to date, the project&#13;
is expected to catalyze investor interest and improve the terms and conditions for&#13;
the bank's privatization. It has been hailed as critical to development of Romania's&#13;
economy. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, IFC has continued to assist in the restructuring&#13;
and privatization of the country's largest banking group (see box). In Albania, IFC&#13;
and EBRD each acquired a 19.5 percent stake in the country's largest insurance&#13;
company, also to support privatization. This investment will improve the company's&#13;
corporate governance, policies, and procedures, making it more attractive to investors.&#13;
    Fostering the development of nonbank financial institutions, especially in housing&#13;
finance and leasing, is another priority. IFC helped establish a specialized company to&#13;
originate and service primary mortgages for Romanian households. In Turkey, where key&#13;
financial sector reforms are beginning to take root, IFC continued to provide financial&#13;
institutions, including an important leasing company, with longer-term funds.&#13;
    IFC is also focusing on strategic support to small and medium enterprises in the&#13;
region. IFC provided funding to Raiffeisen International, a leading SME lender in the&#13;
region. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Moldova, and Romania, we established&#13;
credit lines to banks that lend primarily to small businesses. After investing equity&#13;

Balkan Infrastructure Development Facility&#13;
&#13;
Deficiencies in infrastructure continue to discourage private investors and hinder economic growth&#13;
&#13;
in the Balkan region. To support growth and meet the urgent need for private capital to invest in&#13;
&#13;
infrastructure, IFC is establishing the Balkan Infrastructure Development Facility in cooperation with&#13;
&#13;
USAID and European donors. The facility will help public sector entities in the region attract private&#13;
&#13;
sector investments, focusing on the energy, transportation, and water and sanitation sectors.&#13;
&#13;
The countries covered by the facility are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia,&#13;
&#13;
FYR Macedonia, Romania, and Serbia and Montenegro.&#13;
&#13;
    Managed by IFC and based in Sofia, Bulgaria, the facility reflects the World Bank Group's strategy&#13;
&#13;
to broaden engagement in infrastructure to ensure efficient, affordable, and sustainable delivery of&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
                                            in Microfinance Bank Romania last year, IFC set up a credit line to help it become&#13;
                                            the country's market leader in micro and small business. In addition to its financial&#13;
                                            sector investments, IFC makes its products and services available to smaller businesses&#13;
                                            through SEED, its project development facility (see box), and the Private Enterprise&#13;

                                               Our investments in previously state-owned enterprises are helping increase efficiency,&#13;
                                            improve competitiveness, and raise standards for management, corporate governance,&#13;
                                            and environmental performance. Our clients in FY04 included a steel mill and a glass&#13;
                                            container company in Bulgaria. As part of a strategy to encourage Turkish companies&#13;
                                            with global ambitions to invest in the region, IFC is helping one of Turkey's leading&#13;
                                            glass manufacturers construct two state-of-the-art plants in Bulgaria. These facilities will&#13;
                                            also contribute to Bulgaria's export base. In health and infrastructure, IFC is working&#13;
                                            to facilitate public-private partnerships, providing innovative financing and technical&#13;
                                            assistance to local private sector players and subsovereign public entities (see boxes).&#13;
                                            IFC made its first investment in Turkey's health sector, providing long-term financing&#13;
                                            to MESA, an Ankara-based industrial group, to establish a hospital as part of its strategy&#13;
                                            to become a player in health care. IFC also invested in Euromedic, a leading provider&#13;
                                            of diagnostic imaging and dialysis services in Central, Eastern, and Southern Europe&#13;
                                            and an existing IFC client, to help expand its network in the region. In Albania, IFC&#13;
                                            and EBRD financed Vodafone's development of a nationwide cellular network, which&#13;
                                            will improve telecommunications in many places where the current service is inadequate.&#13;
                                            This is Albania's largest debt-financed project to date and the country's first syndicated&#13;
                                            long-term loan to the private sector. IFC also supported one of Turkey's leading IT&#13;
                                            companies, Meteksan Sistem.&#13;

                                            integrating sustainability into IFC's core business. With loans of $155 million for its&#13;
                                            own account and syndicated loans of $155 million, IFC supported the second stage of&#13;
                                            development of the ACG oil field in Azerbaijan and the associated Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan&#13;
                                            pipeline, which will carry crude oil through Georgia and Turkey to the Mediterranean.&#13;
                                            In addition to providing long-term financing, IFC provided leadership for developing&#13;

SEED: New Horizons for Smaller Businesses&#13;
&#13;
IFC's Southeast Europe Enterprise Development is building the capacity of local institutions to provide sustainable support to small and medium enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
This assistance includes alternative forms of financing for these businesses, including leasing, factoring, and commercial mediation. The rapid growth&#13;
&#13;
of leasing in Serbia and Montenegro, where SEED has provided significant help, shows that the market is eager for innovative and practical options in&#13;
&#13;
financing. The launch of an alternative dispute resolution program in Bosnia and Herzegovina will help businesses avoid lengthy, expensive court proceedings.&#13;
&#13;
      SEED is also working with the region's larger companies to increase their competitiveness by integrating small businesses into their supply chains&#13;
&#13;
and outsourcing more activities to smaller firms. A pilot program with Tigar, a leading producer of tire and rubber goods in Serbia and Montenegro, is&#13;
&#13;
being extended to other large companies in the region, in industries as varied as cement production, car parts manufacturing, steel reprocessing, and&#13;
&#13;
food and beverages. To empower smaller businesses, enhance their sustainability, and promote their collective interests, SEED is working with sectoral&#13;
&#13;
groups, cooperatives, regional networks, and business membership associations in the countries it serves. Through these associations, SEED is reaching&#13;
&#13;
over 1,500 small businesses with its training and consulting services.&#13;
&#13;
      In FY04, SEED came under the direct management of the regional hub in Istanbul, helping ensure full integration of its technical assistance with&#13;

Romania: Public-Private Partnerships for Health Care&#13;
&#13;
With costs rising and demand increasing, health care is an important frontier for public-private partnerships.&#13;
&#13;
In these arrangements, a government or national health insurer contracts with a private medical firm to&#13;
&#13;
provide specific medical services to publicly funded patients. Such partnerships can expand patients' access&#13;
&#13;
and improve the quality of health care services, while reducing costs to governments.&#13;
&#13;
    In Romania, IFC Advisory Services has assisted the Ministry of Health in designing and implementing&#13;
&#13;
a program of public-private partnerships for health care. The pilot transactions, covering a range of medical&#13;
&#13;
services, will be replicated nationwide using IFC-prepared contracts and tender procedures. With IFC's&#13;
&#13;
help, the ministry successfully completed two initial tenders in FY03 for private medical firms to provide&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                        HOSPITAL&#13;

Guatemala: Sustainable Benefits from a Gold Mine&#13;
&#13;
IFC is making a $45 million loan to Montana Exploradora de Guatemala&#13;
&#13;
S.A. to develop the Marlin gold project in western Guatemala. The&#13;
&#13;
country's first major mining investment in over 20 years, the Marlin&#13;
&#13;
mine is expected to produce an average of 217,000 ounces of gold&#13;
&#13;
and 3.3 million ounces of silver annually for up to 15 years.&#13;
&#13;
    In addition to providing financing, IFC will help plan and implement&#13;
&#13;
environmental and social programs in collaboration with Montana,&#13;
&#13;
nongovernmental organizations, local municipalities, and community&#13;
&#13;
members. IFC will help the company train indigenous communities to&#13;
&#13;
develop and manage nurseries for reforestation around the mine, as well as&#13;
&#13;
identify other potential markets that these nurseries can supply. The&#13;
&#13;
programs will help raise the standard of living of local people and provide&#13;
&#13;
sustainable economic opportunities that could outlast closure of the&#13;
&#13;
mine. The project supports Guatemala's efforts to invigorate investment&#13;
&#13;
and improve the competitiveness of the mining sector. It will also set the&#13;
&#13;
standard for social, environmental, and technical management for future&#13;
&#13;
mining projects in the country. The partnership with IFC is expected to&#13;
&#13;
strengthen the company's positive working relationship with the Guatemalan&#13;
&#13;
government and regulators.                                                     RUITEN&#13;

   Iraq: Business Training for Women&#13;
&#13;
   IFC and the World Bank are working to establish a global network of women entrepreneurs&#13;
&#13;
   and business associations that can share best practices and press for improvements in the&#13;
&#13;
   business climate that benefit women in developing countries. As part of this initiative, a&#13;
&#13;
   delegation of Iraqi businesswomen and policymakers interested in women's business issues, led&#13;
&#13;
   by Dr. Rajaa Khuzai of the Governing Council, attended a capacity building training program&#13;
&#13;
   in Vancouver, Canada, in early 2004. Women entrepreneurs from Jordan, representing business&#13;
&#13;
   associations in their country, accompanied the delegation to present possible models for&#13;
&#13;
   associations in Iraq. Discussions also focused on ways of delivering financial services to women&#13;
&#13;
   entrepreneurs. The program featured a workshop cosponsored by FIAS to help translate the&#13;
&#13;
   event into tangible commitments that advance the business agenda for women in Iraq. These&#13;
&#13;
   include a workshop for other women entrepreneurs in Iraq to share key concepts from the&#13;
&#13;
   Vancouver event; the Iraqi Businesswomen's Association is also establishing a program to help&#13;
&#13;
   women learn entrepreneurial skills. Dr. Rajaa and her group are exploring connections with&#13;

   the U.S. National Women's Business Council as a potential model for Iraqi businesswomen to&#13;

Private Enterprise Partnership for the Middle East&#13;
&#13;
IFC launched the Private Enterprise Partnership for the Middle East in FY04. Patterned after the successful,&#13;
&#13;
multidonor Private Enterprise Partnership that IFC operates in the former Soviet Union, PEP-ME aims to&#13;
&#13;
provide broad-based technical assistance to support private sector development. The program focuses on&#13;
&#13;
four markets in the MENA region--Afghanistan, Iraq, West Bank and Gaza, and Yemen--that face particularly&#13;
&#13;
challenging economic circumstances, due either to conflict or to their overall level of development. PEP-ME&#13;
&#13;
is being managed through IFC's regional hub in Cairo, where sector specialists will be located, and there&#13;
&#13;
will also be staff in World Bank offices in all four markets. PEP-ME's specific activities will depend on the&#13;
&#13;
particular circumstances and needs of each location, but the focus, in keeping with larger IFC strategy, will&#13;
&#13;
be to develop the financial sector; support small and medium enterprises; address the business-enabling&#13;
&#13;
environment, including regulatory and legal issues; and support the restructuring or privatization of state-&#13;
&#13;
owned enterprises. The PEP-ME program will be supported by funds from IFC and other donors.&#13;
&#13;
    Initial work is underway on training for financial institutions, as well as for businesswomen in Iraq.&#13;
&#13;
In June 2004, the partnership collaborated with the Arab Academy for Banking and Financial Services to&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                           MARTIN&#13;

       Peru: Studying Water Quality&#13;
       with Local People's Help&#13;
&#13;
       This year, the CAO managed an extensive, independent water&#13;
&#13;
       study of the Cajamarca region of Peru, the site of a mercury&#13;
&#13;
       spill in 2000 that involved Minera Yanacocha, a gold mine in&#13;
&#13;
       which IFC is an investor. The study assessed the mine's impacts&#13;
&#13;
       on the watershed, a key concern of local communities, and&#13;
&#13;
       grew out of the Mesa de Dialogo, a mediation effort between&#13;
&#13;
       the mine and affected communities that the CAO started in&#13;
&#13;
       2001. The CAO hired independent hydrologists to carry out&#13;
&#13;
       the work, which was innovative in involving local people,&#13;
&#13;
       veedores, to help monitor and verify data collection. Data&#13;
&#13;
       gathering and analysis were completed in the summer of&#13;
&#13;
       2003; the results were presented to the Mesa de Dialogo in&#13;
&#13;
       October and to IFC in December 2003. Although the report&#13;
&#13;
       is completed, water study work is ongoing, as the Mesa de&#13;
&#13;
       Dialogo works to address the issues and problems raised.&#13;

       The effort has identified important lessons for IFC in best&#13;

           Collectively, the four factors accurately predicted the&#13;
           quality of about two-thirds of the outcomes.                            · Economic sustainability (61 percent success rate):&#13;

declined in FY04 due to the combined effect of: (1) growth                         from 21.9 percent in FY03. The decrease was due to a&#13;

                             EQUITY AND QUASI-EQUITY&#13;
                             IFC risks its own capital by buying shares in project companies, other project entities,&#13;
                             financial institutions, and portfolio or private equity funds. We generally subscribe&#13;
                             to between 5 and 20 percent of a project's equity. We will not normally hold more&#13;
                             than a 35 percent stake or be the largest shareholder in a project. We are a long-term&#13;
                             investor in our projects. When it comes time to sell, we prefer to exit by selling&#13;
                             shares either in a trade sale or, if liquidity permits, in a capital market following a&#13;
                             public offering.&#13;
                                With quasi-equity instruments we invest through products that have both debt and&#13;
                             equity characteristics. Some instruments, like subordinated loans and convertible debt,&#13;
                             impose fixed-repayment schedules. Others, such as preferred stock and income notes,&#13;
                             do not require such rigid repayment arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                             LOANS AND INTERMEDIARY SERVICES&#13;
                             We finance projects and companies through our A-loans, which are for IFC's own&#13;
                             account. IFC cannot accept government guarantees. Maturities of A-loans generally&#13;
                             range between 7 and 12 years at origination, but some loans have been extended to&#13;
                             as long as 20 years. While most IFC loans are provided in major currencies, we are&#13;
                             expanding our capacity to offer local currency loans.&#13;
                                We carry out comprehensive due diligence before investing in any project. Because&#13;
                             of our extensive lending experience in developing countries, we are uniquely qualified&#13;
                             to evaluate the risks associated with projects. We are willing to extend loans that are&#13;
                             repaid only from the cash flow of the project, with only limited recourse or without&#13;
                             recourse to the sponsors.&#13;
                                We also make loans to intermediary banks, leasing companies, and other financial&#13;
                             institutions through credit lines that result in further on-lending. These credit lines&#13;
                             are often targeted to small businesses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                             SYNDICATED LOANS&#13;
                             Syndicated loans, or B-loans, are a key part of IFC's efforts to mobilize private sector&#13;
                             financing in developing countries, thereby broadening our development impact.&#13;
                             Through this mechanism, financial institutions share fully in the commercial credit&#13;
                             risk of projects, while IFC remains the lender of record. Participants in IFC's loans&#13;
                             share in the advantages that IFC derives as a multilateral development institution,&#13;
                             including preferred access to foreign exchange. Where applicable, these participant&#13;
                             banks are also exempted from the mandatory provisioning requirements that&#13;
                             regulatory authorities may impose.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
STRUCTURED FINANCE&#13;
IFC also offers structured finance solutions to clients, enabling them to raise a&#13;
significantly larger amount of capital than that represented by IFC's own exposure.&#13;
This is especially important for mobilizing local currency funds in the domestic&#13;
market from institutional investors and financial institutions.&#13;
   Through partial credit guarantees of debt instruments, IFC uses its triple-A credit&#13;
rating to help clients diversify their funding sources, extend maturities, and obtain&#13;
financing in their currency of choice. IFC also helps clients structure securitizations&#13;
and risk-sharing facilities, transactions that allow a client to sell off part of the risk&#13;
associated with a pool of assets. IFC is continuing to develop other structured&#13;
products in response to clients' financing needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISK MANAGEMENT&#13;
IFC's risk management products provide clients with access to long-term derivatives&#13;
markets. Currency-hedging instruments allow clients to hedge their foreign exchange&#13;
exposures, typically related to foreign currency borrowings. With the development&#13;
of emerging market derivatives, IFC offers hedges into local currency where these&#13;
markets exist. IFC also provides derivative products to enable clients to manage their&#13;
interest rate and commodity price risks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Technical Assistance and Advisory Services&#13;
IFC advisory services are designed to improve the investment climate in member&#13;
countries and the business practices of companies in which we invest. They play an&#13;
increasingly important role in the way IFC approaches its investment activities.&#13;
   We undertake a wide array of financial market advisory assignments, specializing&#13;
in securities markets and in banking and credit institutions. Assignments address areas&#13;
such as local debt market development and capacity building at financial institutions.&#13;
   IFC collaborates with the World Bank through several joint units dealing with&#13;
aspects of private sector development, including policy issues, sector advice, and&#13;
specific transactions. Our activity in this area includes advice on competition policy,&#13;
privatization structuring, and policy analysis of foreign investment issues.&#13;
   Technical assistance further complements IFC's investment activities by offering&#13;
advisory and training services to governments and private companies. IFC&#13;
manages the Technical Assistance Trust Funds program, which is supported by&#13;
donor governments and an allocation from IFC's own budget. These funds sponsor&#13;
feasibility and sector studies, training initiatives, environmental and social review&#13;
of projects, and advisory assignments to governments. IFC also manages project&#13;
development facilities that help small and medium enterprises, as well as facilities&#13;
focusing on environmental and social issues.&#13;

     NOTES AND DEFINITIONS&#13;
&#13;
     A-loan and B-loan. A single loan agreement between the borrower and IFC normally stipulates the full amount of financing to be provided by IFC and&#13;
     the participating institutions. The IFC loan may be in two portions: (1) the A-loan is IFC's own portion, funded with IFC's own resources and subject to its&#13;
     agreed loan terms; (2) the B-loan is funded by participants on terms that may differ from those of IFC.&#13;
&#13;
     Commitments include (1) signed loan and equity (including quasi-equity) investment agreements; (2) signed guarantee agreements; and (3) risk&#13;
     management facilities that are considered ready for execution as evidenced by a signed International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreement or&#13;
     a signed risk management agreement with a client.&#13;
&#13;
     Disbursements are loans and investments paid out.&#13;
&#13;
     The fiscal year at IFC runs from July 1 to June 30. Thus, FY04 began on July 1, 2003, and ended on June 30, 2004.&#13;
&#13;
     Investment amounts are given in U.S. dollars, regardless of the currencies of the investment. Investment amounts in non-U.S.-dollar currencies are&#13;
     revalued on the ending day of the month in which they are approved.&#13;
&#13;
     On-lending is the process of lending funds from the IFC's own sources through intermediaries, such as local banks.&#13;
&#13;
     Participants and IFC fully share the commercial credit risks of projects, but because IFC is the lender of record, participants receive the same tax and&#13;
     country risk benefits that IFC derives from its special status as a multilateral financial institution.&#13;
&#13;
     Quasi-equity instruments incorporate both loan and equity features, which are designed to provide varying degrees of risk/return trade-offs that lie&#13;
     between those of straight loan and equity investments.&#13;
&#13;
     Rounding of numbers may cause totals to differ from the sum of individual figures in some tables.&#13;
&#13;
     The World Bank includes both IBRD and IDA.&#13;
&#13;
     The World Bank Group includes IBRD, IDA, IFC, MIGA, and ICSID.&#13;

At IFC our mandate is to further sustainable&#13;
economic development through the private sector.&#13;
We pursue this goal through innovative solutions&#13;
to the challenges of development, as we invest in&#13;
companies and financial institutions in emerging&#13;
markets and as we help build business skills. We&#13;
consider positive development impact an integral&#13;
part of good business, and we focus much of our&#13;
effort on the countries with the greatest need for&#13;
investment. We recognize that economic growth&#13;
is sustainable only if it is environmentally and&#13;
socially sound and helps improve the quality of&#13;
life for those living in developing countries.&#13;

            International Finance Corporation (IFC)
            annual report 2004 : adding value to private sector investment
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            For the fiscal year ending June 30,
            2004, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) posted a
            strong portfolio and income growth. Investments for its own
            account were $4.75 billion, a 23 percent increase over FY03
            commitments, while its operating income was $982 million,
            almost double from FY03. The IFC expanded its sustainable
            development impact through private sector project financing
            operations and advisory activities. This year the Board of
            Directors maintained close oversight of development and
            implementation of IFC strategy, outlined the overall
            framework for future IFC activities, and urged the IFC to
            collaborate more closely with other World Bank Group
            institutions. The Board also reviewed country-specific
            operations and discussed 15 joint World Bank-IFC-MIGA
            country assistance strategies and related products.
            Directors noted the challenges in both maintaining
            profitability and increasing development impact, and they
            reaffirmed their support of IFC's focus on frontier
            markets, with a particular emphasis on small and medium
            enterprises; innovative financing mechanisms;
            "south-to-south" investments; long-term
            partnerships; infrastructure; and health and education.
            Specific issues Directors discussed with IFC management
            include the update of the IFC's Safeguard Policies and
            associated guidelines, the review of IFC's Policy on
            Disclosure of Information, an assessment of IFC's
            strategy and procedures for donor funded operations, and, in
            conjunction with other units of the World Bank Group, the
            Extractive Industries Review. These discussions were ongoing
            into FY05, along with a proposal to establish a technical
            assistance and advisory fund to provide sustainable
            financial support for the Corporation's growing
            technical assistance activities.
