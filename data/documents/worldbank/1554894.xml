ABSTRACT&#13;
The main hypothesis tested here is that the exports of a developing&#13;
country, with an advanced manufacturing sector, will differ among&#13;
destinations: the capital intensity of exports will be greater to the more&#13;
labor abundant destinations, and the labor intensity of exports will be&#13;
greater to the more capital abundant destinations. India's exports of&#13;
manufactures for 1973 and 1978 were used for the analysis. The results&#13;
generally corroborate the above hypothesis and also indicate that the&#13;
direction of exports is sustained over time.&#13;
The economies of many developing countries, including India, deviate&#13;
from efficiency conditions. Protection and a higher-than-efficient wage for&#13;
unskilled labor would tend to bias the structure of production in an economy&#13;
towards capital intensity and adversely affect the comparative advantage of&#13;
commodities produced under these distorted conditions. Indian data were used&#13;
to analyze the impact of protection and labor-market distortions on the&#13;
structure of production and relative comparative advantage of commodities.&#13;
The results indicate that protection and higher-than-efficient wages do bias&#13;
the structure of production toward capital intensity and have a negative&#13;
impact on the comparative advantage of commodities. However, although the&#13;
structure of production is affected, the direction of exports is not; the&#13;
validity of the main hypothesis is unaffected by the existence of these&#13;
distortions in the economy.&#13;

CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION&#13;
This study was motivated by conversations with Indian businessmen who&#13;
had noticed a pattern in their export of manufactures - they were shipping&#13;
"sophisticated" products to other developing countries and the Middle East,&#13;
and "simple" products to the developed countries. The Indian press&#13;
corroborated the businessmen's observation by emphasizing the sale of turnkey&#13;
factories to the Middle East and Africa, and garments to developed&#13;
countries. Clearly, if there is a systematic relationship between the&#13;
commodity characteristics of exports of manufactures and destination&#13;
countries, it would be of considerable importance for export promotion policy;&#13;
these policies would be enhanced by becoming commodity and market specific&#13;
instead of just focusing on commodities. Also, presently, there is no&#13;
recognition given to the factor intensity of commodities when export promotion&#13;
policies are designed; this has implications for economywide efficiency of&#13;
resource allocation. However, the Tandon Committee Report on India's Export&#13;
Strategy in the 1980's, India's latest effort at devising a national export&#13;
plan, made no note of either the directionality of India's exports of&#13;
manufactures, or the factor characteristics of commodities, in its policy&#13;
recommendations.&#13;
Other researchers have also observed a directionality in exports.&#13;
The exports of developing countries followed a pattern - they exported their&#13;
capital intensive products to other developing countries and their labor&#13;
intensive products to developed countries. However, these researchers merely&#13;
described the phenomenon, they provided no theoretical framework within which&#13;
their observation could be interpreted. It was not possible to answer&#13;
questions about the cause of the observed pattern of exports, their future&#13;
trend, or whether, in a normative sense, the pattern was desirable. Also, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
research did not posit a statistical relationship between commodity&#13;
characteristics and destination markets. For both these reasons it was not&#13;
possible to draw any policy implications from their work.&#13;
It turned out that A. Krueger (1977) and A. Deardorff (1979) had&#13;
recently extended the Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson factor endowment explanation&#13;
for trade, to a multicommodity, multicountry framework which is appropriate&#13;
for this analysis. A relationship between the factor intensity of an exported&#13;
commodity and destination market factor endowments can be derived from this&#13;
framework; this relationship is amenable to a statistical test thereby&#13;
allowing answers to the policy questions posed above to flow from the&#13;
analysis. Further, A. Krueger's (1977) work on the impact of protection, and&#13;
labor and capital market distortions on the structure of production and trade&#13;
generated interesting policy questions as by-products - in what direction do&#13;
protection and labor market distortions make an impact on the structure of&#13;
production; how does this affect the pattern of exports posited above; how is&#13;
the export performance of commodities affected; is it possible to design&#13;
policies to compensate for these distortions; is it possible to figure out&#13;
what the structure of production would be under efficient allocation, and&#13;
therefore what should be the structure of production 5 or 10 years hence.&#13;
The pertinent previous research is briefly reviewed in Chapter II and&#13;
Krueger and Deardorff s theory summarized in Chapter III. Chapters IV to VI&#13;
contain the results of the analysis for India: export patterns, impact of&#13;
goods and factor market distortions on production, and impact of goods and&#13;
factor market distortions on comparative advantage. Some policy implications&#13;
are derived in Chapter VII and conclusions presented in Chapter VIII.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

CHAPTER II: EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE&#13;
Several researchers have noticed that the commodity characteristics&#13;
of a developing country's exports of manufactures differ by destination;&#13;
exports are labor intensive "upstream" to more developed countries, and&#13;
capital and skill intensive "downstream" to less developed countries. Heller&#13;
(1976) calculated the capital and skill intensity of Japan's exports to&#13;
developed and developing countries for the period 1956-1968. He concluded&#13;
that Japan's exports to other developing countries were more capital and skill&#13;
intensive than Japan's exports to developed countries.&#13;
Heller's conclusions are generally corroborated by other studies&#13;
conducted in recent years. Diaz-Alejandro (1974), in analyzing the export&#13;
expansion of some Latin American countries, notes "that a significant&#13;
difference appears to exist between manufactured exports going to other Latin&#13;
American countries and those going to the rest of the world. The former tend&#13;
to be more *'sophisticated" but also, alas, more capital and import&#13;
intensive." Krueger (1978) compared the labor content of some developing&#13;
countries exports to developed countries, and other developing countries, with&#13;
the conclusion that "with the exception of Thailand, all the countries ...&#13;
were found to have remarkably different products, and therefore factor&#13;
proportions, in their trade with developed countries than with other&#13;
developing countries. Uruguay, for example, exports products to developing&#13;
countries that are less labor using than even the production competing with&#13;
imports from developed countries. Likewise, Chile's exports to developed&#13;
countries require almost 40 more labor per DVA (domestic value added) than&#13;
her total exports." In other words, exports to developing countries are more&#13;
capital intensive than exports to developed countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
Tyler's (1972) analysis of the skill content of Brazil's exports,&#13;
found them to be more skill intensive to developing countries than to&#13;
developed countries. And Amsden (1980), in her study of ten developing&#13;
countries exports finds that "skill intensity ... is both positive and highly&#13;
significant for most exporters" in explaining the share of commodities&#13;
exported to developing countries. Lately, the results of Wolf and&#13;
Havrylyshyn's (1981) analysis of the direct factor content of manufactured&#13;
exports of advanced developing countries "clearly confirm the expectation that&#13;
trade among developing countries is more capital and skill intensive than&#13;
exports of developing countries to industrialized countries."&#13;
These studies, although of considerable descriptive value, lack an&#13;
explicit theoretical framework, and are not designed in a manner that allows&#13;
statistical inferences to be made. These shortcomings make it difficult to&#13;
draw reliable policy conclusions from their results. These inadequacies will&#13;
be addressed in this analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

CHAPTER III: THEORY&#13;
A. Krueger (1977) and A. Deardorff-s (1979) extention of the standard&#13;
two country, two commodity, two factor Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson [HOS] model&#13;
to a multicountry, multicommodity, two factor framework is particularly&#13;
pertinent for this analysis. After stating its assumptions, the model will be&#13;
outlined and a pattern of production and trade derived. Then, the impact of&#13;
distortions in the goods and factor markets on that pattern of production and&#13;
trade will be discussed.&#13;
(a) Assumptions&#13;
All the standard HOS assumptions and no factor price equalization&#13;
between countries, apply. What this means is that perfectly competitive&#13;
conditions prevail, there are universal prices, no transport costs, and all&#13;
the countries have access to the same technology menu. The important&#13;
difference between countries, that determines their pattern of production and&#13;
trade, is in their factor endowments.&#13;
(b) Pattern of Production&#13;
Given the assumptions above, it is possible to rank countries on the&#13;
basis of their factor endowments, and commodities on the basis of factor&#13;
intensity; countries will specialize in the production of commodities&#13;
according to their relative factor endowments. Production in the most labor&#13;
abundant country will be concentrated on the most labor intensive commodities,&#13;
and production in the most capital abundant country will include production of&#13;
the most capital intensive goods, with countries in between specializing in&#13;
the production of commodities with factor intensities appropriate to their&#13;
factor endowments. 1/ Countries will rely on trade to provide commodities&#13;
that they do not produce.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
(c) Pattern of Trade&#13;
The pattern of trade will differ between countries on two sides of a&#13;
country's factor endowment. Any country, not at the extremes of the factor&#13;
endowment ranking, will import commodities that are more capital intensive&#13;
than its own production choice from countries with larger capital/labor&#13;
endowments. The same country will also import commodities that are more labor&#13;
intensive than its own production choice from other countries with smaller&#13;
capital/labor endowments.&#13;
A country s exports will differ among destinations; the capital&#13;
intensity of exports will be greater to the more labor abundant destinations,&#13;
and the labor intensity of exports will be greater to the more capital&#13;
abundant destinations. 2/ This directionality of exports has obvious&#13;
implications for export promotion policies and is the basis of hypotheses&#13;
tested in this paper.&#13;
(d) Distortions in the Goods and Factor Markets&#13;
In most developed countries markets function fairly efficiently so&#13;
the Krueger-Deardorff version of the HOS model outlined above can be tested by&#13;
analyzing the production and trade of those countries. However, in many&#13;
developing countries there are significant deviations from efficiency&#13;
conditions that could alter their structure of production and trade such that&#13;
it may not conform to the specialization patterns set forth above. The&#13;
deviations fall into two categories: first, distortions in the goods markets&#13;
because of protection, subsidies, and taxes resulting in a divergence of&#13;
domestic from international prices and second, distortions in the factor&#13;
markets resulting in wage and interest rates that do not reflect the&#13;
opportunity costs of employing labor and capital respectively. It turns out&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
that the analysis of trade patterns is unaffected by the existence of&#13;
distortions in the goods and factor markets with the notable exceptions of&#13;
(a) taxes and subsidies to production and trade and (b) inter-industry factor&#13;
price differentials. Where these two distortive situations exist, anything&#13;
can happen, and production and trade may bear no relationship to that which&#13;
would have occurred under an efficient allocation regime. 3/&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

CHAPTER IV: EXPORT PATTERNS&#13;
The empirical evidence and theory presented above suggest hypotheses&#13;
about a country's pattern of exports. These hypotheses are specified and&#13;
tested in this Chapter. India's exports of manufactures for 1973 and 1978 are&#13;
used as the data for the tests (1978 was the most recent year for which trade&#13;
data were available).&#13;
The general hypothesis is that India's exports of manufactures will&#13;
have different commodity characteristics according to their destination:&#13;
countries that have a relatively greater capital/labor endowment will receive&#13;
relatively higher labor content and relatively more of the labor intensive&#13;
goods; countries that have a relatively smaller capital/labor endowment will&#13;
receive relatively higher capital content and relatively more of the capital&#13;
intensive commodities.&#13;
There are two alternative interpretations of the HOS theory. The&#13;
factor content version holds that a country will be a net exporter of its&#13;
abundant factors embodied in traded goods; the factor content - labor and&#13;
capital - of trade has to be analyzed. The commodity version states that a&#13;
country exports those commodities that intensively use the country's&#13;
relatively abundant factors. Theoretically, the factor content version is&#13;
considered to be the more robust, 4/ however, both versions are tested here.&#13;
(a) Factor Content&#13;
Factor content can be measured as just the direct factor content of&#13;
exports or, direct plus indirect factor content of exports. The models for&#13;
these two measures will be stated separately and the statistical tests&#13;
specified later because they are the same for both measures.&#13;

respectively, as physical capital/labor (K/L), human&#13;

Results&#13;
A series of regressions were run using ratios of factor content of&#13;
India's exports of manufactures, in 1973 and 1978, to 50 destinations as the&#13;
dependent variables and the destination country endowments as the explanatory&#13;
variables. The factor content ratios were defined as physical capital/labor,&#13;
human capital/labor, and physical plus human capital/labor; these definitions&#13;
of capital/labor cover the two possibilities of human capital being a&#13;
complement to physical capital and of human capital being a substitute.&#13;
Explanatory variables were defined in concordance with the factor content&#13;
ratio definition - where the physical capital/labor factor content ratio was&#13;
used as the dependent variable, physical capital/labor endowment was used as&#13;
the explanatory variable, etc. The data for 1973 and 1978 were also pooled&#13;
and the same regressions run to see whether there had been a structural change&#13;
in the estimated relationships between the two periods.&#13;
The results are presented in Tables 1 and 2. As can be seen the&#13;
signs of all the estimated coefficients are, as expected, consistently&#13;
negative for both years, individually and pooled, for direct and direct plus&#13;
indirect factor content, and whether one explanatory variable was used or&#13;

-13-&#13;
all cases the coefficient is significantly different from zero at either the&#13;
5% or 1% level of significance. In the six equations using two explanatory&#13;
variables the significance level of the individual estimated coefficients&#13;
drops, even though the F statistic indicates that the total estimation is&#13;
significant at the 5% or 1% level. This relatively worse performance is&#13;
probably due to some collinearity among the two explanatory variables; the&#13;
standard errors of the estimated coefficients do increase in the two&#13;
explanatory variables cases over the one explanatory variable cases, and the&#13;
correlation coefficient between the two explanatory variables is significant&#13;
at the 1% level.&#13;
The magnitude of the estimated coefficients change between 1973 and&#13;
1978 in a consistent direction in every regression. A Chow test was used to&#13;
determine if there had been a structural change in the estimated coefficients&#13;
between the two years. The test indicated that there was no structural change&#13;
in the estimated relationship between the 1973 and 1978; the models are robust&#13;
for that period.&#13;
Other minor aspects of the results worth noting are first, that the&#13;
results for 1978 are consistently better than for 1973, and the results of the&#13;
pooled estimation are even better than those for 1978. The pooled estimates&#13;
are the best because of the increased degrees of freedom but there is no&#13;
obvious reason for the improvement of the 1978 results over 1973. Second, for&#13;
both analyses, direct and direct plus indirect, physical capital endowment is&#13;
the better explanatory variable. This is probably because physical capital&#13;
endowments were calculated for all countries using the same methodology and&#13;
for the same time periods, whereas the human capital endowments were obtained&#13;
from surveys taken at various times, and the same human capital endowments were&#13;
assumed for the 1973 and 1978 analyses; the physical capital endowment data&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
are probably more reliable than the human capital endowments. Third, all of&#13;
the regressions in Tables 1 and 2 were tried in log-linear form to test for&#13;
one kind of heteroscedasticity. The results were not markedly different from&#13;
those presented in Tables 1 and 2 indicating that heteroscedasticity, at least&#13;
due to scale differences, is not a significant problem.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
The results strongly suggest that the hypothesis as stated cannot be&#13;
rejected even though the explanatory variables do not explain much of the&#13;
variation in the dependent variable. It is very likely that there is a inverse&#13;
relationship between the capital/labor ratio of factor content of India's&#13;
exports of manufactures, and the destination country's capital/labor factor&#13;
endowment; this relationship was robust during the 1970's.&#13;
The direct factor content results are more reliable for two&#13;
reasons. First, for a developing country such as India, direct factor content&#13;
is a more appropriate measure than direct plus indirect factor content because&#13;
the latter does not incorporate non-competing imported inputs that are&#13;
included in exports; the direct factor content measure treats all inputs as&#13;
being internationally traded and therefore not relevant for consideration in&#13;
estimating trade in factor services of any particular country. 5/ Second,&#13;
direct coefficients for agriculture, mining, and service sectors were not&#13;
available, thus the direct plus indirect coefficients potentially suffer from&#13;
a bias in measurement. -&#13;
(b) Commodity&#13;
The commodity version will be tested by estimating the following&#13;
relationships and examining them for significance. The first stage of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
test equations estimates the relationship between capital intensity of a&#13;
commodity and its relative comparative advantage in each destination country;&#13;
the estimated coefficients are dependent variables in the second stage with&#13;
destination country endowments as the explanatory variables. The linking of&#13;
factor intensity of commodities and factor endowment of countries via the&#13;
relative comparative advantage ratio posits a test of the general hypothesis&#13;
stated above.&#13;

Results&#13;
The results are presented in Table 3. Of the eight possible&#13;
estimated coefficients, seven have the expected negative sign and one has a&#13;
positive sign; in most of the cases the coefficients were different from zero&#13;
at the 1% level of significance. Among the explanatory variables, physical&#13;
capital performed better, probably for the reasons stated earlier. As with&#13;
the factor content analysis the proportion of variation in the dependent&#13;
variable explained by the explanatory variables is not very great but physical&#13;
capital explained more of the variation than did human capital. There is no&#13;
obvious pattern in the estimates for 1973 as compared with 1978.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
These results are supportive of the hypothesis but not quite as&#13;
supportive as the factor content analysis. This may partly be explained by&#13;
problems with the RCA ratio, 7/ and in the coefficients used as dependent&#13;
variables in the second stage. 8 It is worth remembering that the commodity&#13;
interpretation of HOS is not theoretically as strong as the factor content&#13;
interpretation; these results should be weighted accordingly.&#13;

(c)  Conclusions&#13;
The overall conclusion for the test of the hypothesis about trade&#13;
patterns is that, although the explanatory variables did not explain much of&#13;
the variation in.the,dependent variable,..virtually all the signs of the&#13;
estimated coefficients were negative as expected and in almost all cases were&#13;
significantly different from zero at the 5% or 1% levels. The results&#13;
strongly suggest that the hypothesis cannot be rejected and the probability is&#13;
high that the relationship specified in the hypothesis is valid. The results&#13;
for the factor content analysis were more robust than those for the commodity&#13;
analysis; this is probably because of the greater disaggregation of RCA ratios&#13;
and also perhaps due to an inadequate estimation technique. The policy&#13;
implications of these results will be discussed in the last chapter.&#13;

CHAPTER V: PROTECTION AND LABOR MARKET DISTORTIONS&#13;
(a) Protection&#13;
The Indian economy is quite heavily protected so some impact on the&#13;
structure of production is to be expected. The theory outlined above suggests&#13;
that India, being a relatively labor abundant country, would tend to protect&#13;
its capital intensive industries; the structure of production in India will be&#13;
more capital intensive than under an efficient allocation. However, if the&#13;
relationship between protection and capital intensity of industries is&#13;
systematic, then the pattern of trade outlined above should not be affected;&#13;
tests of the directionality of exports will be credible in spite of&#13;
protection. 2/ Indeed, if the protected commodities are given subsidies that&#13;
enable them to be exported, then our theory predicts that these subsidies will&#13;
reinforce the trade pattern yielded under an efficient allocation; India will&#13;
have a yet greater tendency to export capital intensive goods to countries&#13;
that are relatively labor abundant.&#13;
Statistical Test&#13;

j = 1...35          where&#13;

Xij  =  Capital intensity of commodity   j , defined k/l, h/i,&#13;
k+h/l   as above for i = 1.. .3 respectively.&#13;
Results&#13;
The results are presented in Table 4. The sign of the coefficients&#13;
of all the capital intensity definitions used as explanatory variables are&#13;
positive as expected, but only one of these coefficients is significantly&#13;
different from zero at the 5% level of significance; also, the explanatory&#13;
variables do not explain much of the variation in the dependent variable.&#13;

Conclusions&#13;
Although these results do not indicate rejection of a systematic&#13;
relationship between protection and capital intensity of industries in India,&#13;
they do not give strong support to it either.&#13;
(b) Labor Market Distortion&#13;
Because of a series of government regulations and trade union&#13;
activities, the wage structure in India is distorted in the direction of being&#13;
higher than under efficient allocation. This distortion will make the&#13;
production and trade bundle of India more capital intensive than under&#13;
efficient allocation and again, the theory used in this study predicts that&#13;
the trade pattern yielded by an efficient allocation of resources will be&#13;
reinforced. 11/&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
Results&#13;
The results are presented on Table 5. There is, as expected, a&#13;
strong positive relationship between the capital intensity of an industry and&#13;
the labor market distortion in that industry; all the coefficients are&#13;
different from zero at the 1% level of significance.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
There is strong evidence that labor market distortions are positively&#13;
related to the capital intensity of Indian industries; these industries are&#13;
clearly more capital intensive than they would be under an efficient&#13;
allocation.&#13;
(c) Conclusions&#13;
There is some evidence that protection, and strong evidence that&#13;
labor market distortions, result in Indian industries being more capital&#13;
intensive than under an efficient allocation. However, although the structure&#13;
of production is affected, the pattern of exports is not. Indeed, if export&#13;
subsidies are given to these distorted industries, it is possible that the&#13;
trade pattern yielded under efficient allocation will be reinforced. The&#13;
policy implications of these results will be discussed in the last chapter.&#13;

CHAPTER VI: COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE, PROTECTION, AND LABOR MARKET DISTORTIONS&#13;
Theoretically, there is a relationship between comparative advantage&#13;
of an exported commodity, relative to total exports of manufactures, and&#13;
protection and labor market distortions. Protected commodities can only be&#13;
exported if they are subsidized; they will not enjoy a relative comparative&#13;
advantage among India's exports. A higher wage than is efficient will result&#13;
in the production of commodities that are more capital intensive than is&#13;
appropriate for India's relative position in the factor endowment ranking,&#13;
these commodities will also not enjoy a relative comparative advantage among&#13;
India's exports.&#13;

Conclusions&#13;
Effective protection and labor market distortions do have a weak&#13;
negative impact on the relative comparative advantage of a commodity. It is&#13;
possible that the negative impact of these distortions is weakened by the&#13;
existence of subsidies. However, a glance at the cash subsidies schedule for&#13;
exports for 1980 suggests that they vary from 5% to 15%, but are mostly around&#13;
10%; this level of subsidy is unlikely to weaken the impact of effective&#13;
protection rates that are frequently over 100%, and labor market distortions&#13;
that are quite severe. The Indian government's contention that cash subsidies&#13;
are essentially to compensate for internal taxes appears to be true.&#13;
Since India is often quoted as the example of an inefficient economy&#13;
riddled with distortions, the relatively weak negative impact of distortions&#13;
on relative comparative advantage is surprising. A possible explanation is&#13;
that Indian exporters are selling at internationally competitive prices that&#13;
are below their full cost; as long as the export price plus any subsidy is&#13;
above the variable cost of a commodity, the exporter earns a contribution to&#13;
overheads. This business practice is quite normal when there is idle&#13;
capacity, and there has certainly been idle capacity in many industries in&#13;
India during the 1973-78 period.&#13;

CHAPTER VII: POLICY IMPLICATIONS&#13;
There are policy implications that can be drawn from this study&#13;
immediately, and there are others that will require further work. The&#13;
immediate policy implications are first, this study provides a focus for the&#13;
work of India's export promotion agencies (Export Promotion Councils, Trade&#13;
Development Authority, Institute of Foreign Trade, etc.); India should be&#13;
promoting the export of its capital intensive manufactured goods in developing&#13;
countries and its labor intensive manufactures in developed countries. For&#13;
instance, if engineering goods are capital intensive, then Chicago is not an&#13;
efficient location for India's Engineering Export Promotion Council; rather&#13;
the same. monies would be better spent at a Middle East or North African&#13;
location. The-Tandon Committee on India's Export Strategy in the 1980's&#13;
suggested a new export overseer organization under a Secretary, Exports&#13;
Department, that will design and help implement, a National Export Plan. The&#13;
Committee suggested that the work of the Exports Department be divided into&#13;
about io industry divisions.   This study indicates that the Exports Department&#13;
should consider a matrix type of organization where there is responsibility&#13;
for markets on the one hand, and industries on the other. Exports policies&#13;
can no longer be just commodity specific, they have to address the&#13;
directionality of exports.&#13;
Second, the Tandon Committee felt the "need to develop market-wise&#13;
data to develop a market-based approach....each market should be analyzed for&#13;
the range of products that India can supply competitively." The type of&#13;
information needed for such an anlaysis is similar to that used in this study.&#13;
Historical data on market share by commodity, by destination, and data for&#13;
relative comparative advantage of each of 76 commodities across destinations&#13;
are available; all of these data can be related to the industry&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
characteristics of the 76 cqmmodities. This information can be immediately&#13;
used to focus the element of the Cash Compensatory Support given on the&#13;
"infant export industry" argument. Markets where India should enjoy a&#13;
comparative advantage can be identified and subsidized; the subsidy should be&#13;
commodity and market specific rather than just commodity specific.&#13;
Although this study has broken ground for other areas of policy more&#13;
work is needed before any implications can be drawn. The first such area is&#13;
the relationship between protection and factor market distortions, structure&#13;
of production, and export performance. Effective protection data are needed&#13;
for all the 76 ISIC 4 digit commodity groups, and measures for labor and&#13;
capital market distortions have to be refined and related to policy&#13;
instruments that cause them. If this work were done, it would be possible to&#13;
estimate the impact of distortions on the structure of production and export&#13;
performance, and then devise policies to either remove the cause of the&#13;
distortions, or to compensate for them; these policies could be economywide or&#13;
industry specific depending on the nature of the distortion.&#13;
Second, if the work on distortions suggested above were available,&#13;
then it would be possible to make an informed statement about the industries&#13;
which it would be economically efficient for India to develop 5 years, or 10&#13;
years hence; these would also be industries in which India would enjoy a&#13;
comparative advantage in exports. This information would be invaluable for&#13;
industrial and commerical policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CHAPTER VIII: CONCLUSIONS&#13;
The major hypothesis of this study appears to be valid; India's&#13;
exports of manufactures have a different factor content and different&#13;
commodity characteristics according to their destination--countries that are&#13;
more developed receive relatively more of the labor intensive goods, and&#13;
countries that are less developed receive relatively more of the capital&#13;
intensive goods. There is also evidence that this pattern of exports was&#13;
maintained through the decade of the 1970's. This result is especially&#13;
striking because the protection systems in the world are biased against such&#13;
an outcome. In general, developed countries have relatively high trade&#13;
barriers against labor intensive imports, and developing countries have&#13;
relatively high trade barriers against capital intensive imports.&#13;
There is evidence that protection, and a higher wage than is&#13;
efficient for unskilled labor, have resulted in India's industrial structure&#13;
being more capital intensive than would be true under efficient allocation;&#13;
these distortions also had a negative impact on the relative export&#13;
performance of commodities. However, although the structure of production is&#13;
affected, the directionality of exports is not. Indeed, it is possible that&#13;
protection and high wages reinforce the pattern of exports posited in this&#13;
study.&#13;
These results can be used to design market and commodity specific&#13;
export promotion policies which are presently only commodity specific. With&#13;
further work it will be possible to devise policies that counter the effect of&#13;
protection and labor market distortions on the structure of production, and to&#13;
predict an efficient investment pattern for the future; this information could&#13;
have a significant impact on industrial and commercial policy.&#13;

1/    A detailed derivation of the pattern of production is available in A.&#13;
Krueger (1977), A. Deardorff (1979), and A. Khanna (1982).&#13;
2/    The pattern of exports is derived in A. Khanna (1982).&#13;
3/    A. Krueger (1977) has a detailed discussion of distortions and their&#13;
impact on production and trade.&#13;
4/    R. Baldwin (1979), A. Deardorff (1980), W. Travis (1972) discuss the two&#13;
interpretations of the HOS model.&#13;
5/    For a full discussion of this issue see A. Khanna (1982).&#13;
6/    The direct plus indirect factor content analysis includes only the&#13;
direct plus indirect factor content of manufacturing; coefficients for&#13;
agriculture, mining, and service sectors were not available. This&#13;
analysis suffers from a potential bias in measurement. However in no&#13;
previous study have the results for direct, and direct plus indirect,&#13;
factor content differed.&#13;
7/    There are 76 RCA's per destination ranging in value from zero to one&#13;
thousand. The great variation in the value of RCA's suggests that,&#13;
because of the level of disaggregation, this measure is susceptible to a&#13;
lot of noise, and therefore less reliable.&#13;
8/    There are weaknesses in this technique, first, that each of the&#13;
estimated coefficients has a different variance and therefore a&#13;
different level of reliability which has not been considered. Second,&#13;
that relatively few of the coefficients were significantly different&#13;
from zero at the 5% level. However, the coefficients are the maximum&#13;
likelihood estimates and therefore the most reliable for use in the&#13;
second stage.&#13;
9/    See A. Krueger (1977).&#13;
10/   The weak results are probably due to the level of aggregation&#13;
required. Effective protection rates for India were obtained from&#13;
Bhagwati and Srinivasan's NBER study on India. A concordance between&#13;
the NBER and Indian industry classifications was developed for only 35&#13;
commodity groups.&#13;

APPENDIX I&#13;
DATA SOURCES&#13;
I.       TRADE&#13;
India's exports of manufactures for 1973 and 1978 by destination, and&#13;
India's relative comparative advantage ratios for 1973 and 1978 by commodity&#13;
and by destination were obtained from the World Bank's copy of the United&#13;
Nations trade data tapes. The World Bank's concordance program was used to&#13;
convert the United Nations data classified in Standard International Trade&#13;
Classifications (SITC) to the International Standard Industrial&#13;
Classifications (ISIC) used in this analysis.&#13;
II.      INDUSTRY&#13;
a. INDIAN&#13;
i. Indian industry direct coefficients, labor market distortions,&#13;
and excess profits estimates were calculated from data obtained from the&#13;
"Annual Survey of Industries 1973-74: Summary Results for the Factory Sector"&#13;
published by the Central Statistical Organization, Ministry of Planning,&#13;
India.&#13;
ii. An input-output table for India was developed from the "National&#13;
Accounts Statistics Transaction Table for 1973-74" also published by the&#13;
Central Statistical Organization, Ministry of-Planning, India.&#13;
b. UNITED STATES&#13;
U.S. industry direct coefficients were calculated from data obtained&#13;
from the "Census of Manufactures 1972" published by the Department of&#13;
Commerce, United States.&#13;
III.     COUNTRY ENDOWMENTS&#13;
a. LABOR&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
Labor force data for countries was obtained from "Labor Force&#13;
Estimates and Projections 1950-2000" published by the International Labor&#13;
Office. The estimated number was used for the 1970 labor endowment and the&#13;
low projection was used for the 1975 endowment.&#13;
b. HUMAN CAPITAL&#13;
Two types of human capital endowment data were gathered:&#13;
i.  Literacy rates (male and total) for countries were obtained from&#13;
the "Statistical Yearbook 1980" published by UNESCO. For the few countries&#13;
that these rates were not available, the rates for similar countries were&#13;
used.   For instance, the U.S. literacy rates used for other developed&#13;
countries. '&#13;
ii.  Data for percentages of countries labor force that falls into&#13;
both (a) professional, technical, and related workers and (b) administrative,&#13;
executive, and managerial categories were obtained from various issues of the&#13;
"Yearbook of Labor Statistics" published by the International Labor Office.&#13;
c. PHYSICAL CAPITAL&#13;
a. BASIC DATA&#13;
The data for Gross Domestic Investment (GDI) in domestic currency&#13;
were obtained from he "World Tables 1976, 1980" published by the World Bank&#13;
for all non-socialist block countries and from various issues of the United&#13;
Nations National Account Statistics for all the socialist block countries.&#13;
GDI data were missing for the period 1955-60 for a few countries; in these&#13;
cases the annual average growth rate of GDI for the period 1960-65 was used to&#13;
approximate GDI for the earlier period.&#13;
The data for exchange rates to convert the domestic currency physical&#13;
capital endowments into dollars was obtained from the "World Tables 1975,&#13;
1980" for all non-socialist block countries and from "Pick's Currency Annual,&#13;
1976" for socialist block countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
b. CALCULATION METHODOLOGY&#13;
All GDI data were converted to constant 1970 prices (except&#13;
Czechoslovakia and the USSR) using implicit GDI price deflators. The physical&#13;
capital endowments for 1970 and 1975 were calculated uisng the following&#13;
formula&#13;
T&#13;
KT =      X (l-r)T-            where&#13;
t=t&#13;
0&#13;
KT = Physical capital endowment in year T in domestic currency.&#13;
Xt=    GDI in year t.&#13;
r = Double declining depreciation rate of 13.3% based on the assumption of&#13;
an average 15 years asset life.&#13;
These physical capital endowment numbers for 1970 and 1975 were then&#13;
converted to dollars using the average exchange rate for 1970.&#13;
In the case of Czechoslovakia and the USSR, base years of 1967 and&#13;
1969, respectively, had to be used, and these physical capital endowments were&#13;
converted into dollars using the exchange rates for 1967 and 1969. The dollar&#13;
endowments were then adjusted for U.S. inflation to the base year 1970 to be&#13;
consistent with the endowment data for other countries.&#13;
IV.      EFFECTIVE PROTECTION&#13;
Rates of effective protection applied to industries in India were&#13;
obtained from the National Burea of Economic Research study by J. Bhagwati and&#13;
T.N. Srinivasan Foreign Trade Regimes and Economic Development.&#13;

            Testing for the direction of exports :
            India's exports of manufactures in the 1970s
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main hypothesis tested here is that
            the exports of a developing country, with an advanced
            manufacturing sector, will differ among destinations: the
            capital intensity of exports will be greater to the more
            labor abundant destinations, and the labor intensity of
            exports will be greater to the more capital abundant
            destinations. India's exports of manufactures for 1973
            and 1978 were used for the analysis. The economies of many
            developing countries, including India, deviate from
            efficiency conditions. Protection and a
            higher-than-efficient wage for unskilled labor would tend to
            bias the structure of production in an economy towards
            capital intensity and adversely affect the comparative
            advantage of commodities produced under these distorted
            conditions. Indian data were used to analyze the impact of
            protection and labor-market distortions on the structure of
            production and relative comparative advantage of
            commodities. The results indicate that protection and
            higher-than-efficient wages do bias the structure of
            production toward capital intensity and have a negative
            impact on the comparative advantage of commodities. However,
            although the structure of production is affected, the
            direction of exports is not.
