1. URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,&#13;
A. URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS&#13;
1.1   The mid-1970s loss to pollution of a major urban raw water supply source near&#13;
Beijing first drew China's attention to the damage pollution could cause. Over the&#13;
ensuing 20 years China has developed an environmental protection system employing a&#13;
broad set of control instruments administered through environmental protection bureaus&#13;
now found in all cities and virtually all rural counties. This experience led China to&#13;
develop a national environmental action plan to coordinate domestic environmental&#13;
improvement efforts. China has also been a responsive partner in international efforts to&#13;
control pollution and was one of the first countries to develop their Agenda 21 program&#13;
after the Rio conference.&#13;
1.2   Despite their activism, the Chinese have had mixed success in implementing&#13;
environmental policy over the past two decades. Some aspects of the record are quite&#13;
good-total suspended particulate (TSP) concentrations have been markedly reduced in&#13;
cities in both north and south China (see Figure 1.1) and state-owned enterprise&#13;
discharges of toxic metals in wastewater have also fallen substantially. However, even&#13;
with reductions in TSPs, ambient concentrations remain above international and Chinese&#13;
guidelines in many cities and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions have not been effectively&#13;
constrained (see Figure 1.1). Water pollution continues to grow. The percentage of&#13;
urban aquifers deemed polluted has risen from 20 percent in 1983 to 45 percent today. In&#13;
the most recently published water quality survey, at least some sections of rivers in 54 of&#13;
58 reporting cities failed to meet even the lowest acceptable standard, leaving few&#13;
economic uses-except as waste sinks.&#13;
1.3   The human cost of these pollutants is high. Over 400 million Chinese live in&#13;
cities, a number expected to jump to some 800 million by 2010. Annual premature&#13;
deaths in urban China due to TSP are currently estimated at over 150,000. Other&#13;
epidemiological work has shown a very strong relationship between outdoor SO2&#13;
concentrations and mortality in northern Chinese cities. The health costs of water&#13;
pollution are more difficult to measure. But water pollution has forced cities to move to&#13;
increasingly distant and more expensive raw water sources, farmers have had to switch&#13;
For a detailed discussion please see "China: Environmental Strategy Paper" (Report No. 9669-CHA, April&#13;
1992); and "China: Urban Environmental Service Managements' (Report No. 13073-CHA, December&#13;
1994).&#13;

WHO Guidelines&#13;
1.4    The reasons for the growing pollution are not difficult to identify. A coal-based&#13;
fuel system firing a large stock of inefficient boilers and power plants contributes to air&#13;
quality problems, as does widespread dependence on coal stoves for household cooking&#13;
and heating. With urban growth and rising personal incomes have come rapid increases&#13;
in the volurne of municipal wastewater flows-they grew from 7 billion m annually in&#13;
1984 to  13 billion m3 in 1992.  Those came with the growth of in-house water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
connections and of washing machines and flush toilets. Industrial wastewater discharges&#13;
in urban areas declined over that same period, as reuse and other water-saving techniques&#13;
increased water use efficiency. Solid waste generation has also grown rapidly, and only&#13;
some 25 percent of the municipal solid waste and nightsoil are disposed of to national&#13;
standards. The remainder is dumped at uncovered dumping sites without leachate or gas&#13;
control facilities.&#13;
1.5   The nature of the discharges affecting the urban environment dictate a mix of&#13;
regulatory and investment responses by different levels of government. These have been&#13;
discussed in two Bank sector studies, the first analyzing overall environmental&#13;
circumstances and policy (China: Environmental Strategy Paper, Report No. 9669-CHA,&#13;
April 1992) and the second that specific to the urban sector (China: Urban Environmental&#13;
Service Management, Report No. 13073-CHA, December 1994). As described in those&#13;
reports, municipal governments must seek an efficient mix of point source control&#13;
through regulation and collective treatment of wastes.&#13;
B. REGULATION OF POINT SOURCES&#13;
1.6   The regulation of point source pollution falls to the National Environmental&#13;
Protection Agency (NEPA), as the secretariat of the State Council Environmental&#13;
Protection Committee.  NEPA  drafts national regulations and other aspects of&#13;
environmental policy for consideration by the State Council and National People's&#13;
Congress. NEPA has the power to interpret national environmental regulations and&#13;
standards, including those governing the operations of the local environmental protection&#13;
bureaus (EPBs) that work at provincial and municipal level. However, NEPA lacks&#13;
implementation authority, a power left to local governments and the EPBs under them.&#13;
1.7   Provincial governments are authorized to set local environmental standards in the&#13;
absence of preemptive national standards, or to impose more stringent standards than&#13;
those required by the national govermnent. Provincial EPBs coordinate these local&#13;
policies and, in contrast to NEPA, may play a direct role in implementation. However,&#13;
the municipal, urban district and county EPBs bear the main burden of enforcement for&#13;
both national and provincial regulations. The budgets, personnel appointments, and work&#13;
plans of each level EPB derive from the government of that level. To aid quality control,&#13;
environmental performance must be reported to the next higher administrative level EPB,&#13;
which also sets testing protocols and other performance criteria.&#13;
1.8   China's regulatory approach has focused on three instruments: environmental&#13;
assessment before approval of new projects; the "three simultaneous" licensing strategy&#13;
that requires integration of pollution control in project design, inclusion of the abatement&#13;
measures in the actual investment, and proper operation of the abatement equipment; and&#13;
a pollution levy fee chargeable against waste streams that have concentrations of'&#13;
pollutants above permitted levels. More recently, goverrunents have been authorized to&#13;
levy a small charge on wastewater discharges within standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.9   The pollution levy fees fund operation of the environmental protection system.&#13;
Local EPBs retain approximately 20 percent of the fees to cover operating costs, while&#13;
earmarking the remaining funds to finance pollution abatement in eligible enterprises.&#13;
The handling of the earmarked funds has shifted over time from being granted directly&#13;
back to the enterprise paying the fee to lending the funds on concessional terms for&#13;
eligible pollution control investments.&#13;
1.10  NEPA now recognizes two problems with the pollution levy fee system. First,&#13;
fees are typically set considerably below the marginal cost of effluent treatment, which&#13;
encourages enterprises to pay the fee rather than operate or invest in treatment facilities or&#13;
cleaner production technologies. Second, by setting fees on a concentration basis, the&#13;
surface water receiving discharges could fail to meet standards even though all&#13;
enterprises in a watershed individually meet standards. Conversely, if assimilative&#13;
capacity is high and enterprises few, the concentration standard could force compliance&#13;
costs far above the damage done by the discharge.&#13;
1.11  Two more regulatory issues originate in structural features of the economy. The&#13;
first arises from the fact that local governments usually own the major enterprises within&#13;
their boundaries, leading to pressures to relax regulation or fee collection in the interest of&#13;
employment and profits. The second is that the enterprises operating on the periphery of&#13;
cities may have a large impact on municipal environmental quality, yet fall outside&#13;
municipal control. This latter problem is particularly acute with the small-scale tovnship&#13;
and village enterprises (TVEs). Individual TVE enforcement costs are high relative to&#13;
output, yet in the aggregate TVE pollution has a large impact on the downstream&#13;
environment.&#13;
1.12  NEPA has a large research and experimentation program underway to icLentify&#13;
new approaches to overcome these and other regulatory problems. Among the initiatives&#13;
is the use of catchment specific mass-based pollution permits to replace the&#13;
concentration-based fees. More generally, NEPA seeks effective market based pollution&#13;
control mechanisms to complement the national shift to a market-based econormy and&#13;
avoid many of the problems of enterprise-specific regulation.  The Bank supports&#13;
NEPA's program through the Environmental Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 2522) and&#13;
investment projects such as this proposed loan.&#13;
C. COLLECTIVE WASTE HANDLING AND TREATMENT&#13;
1.13  Urban environmental services, which include wastewater collection and treatment&#13;
systems and solid waste collection and treatment, fall under the purview of the&#13;
Construction Commissions found in every Chinese city. Overall regulatory guidance and&#13;
standard setting is provided by the Ministry of Construction and the provincial&#13;
Construction Bureaus. The Ministry and Bureaus set national and provincial policy for&#13;
urban and regional planning, infrastructure development planning, and facility operating&#13;
standards. They also specify financial accounting procedures and goals. Based on those&#13;
policies and standards, the municipal commissions provide or regulate providers of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
actual service. The municipal commissions are typically among the largest and most&#13;
powerful of the municipal administrative bodies, having under them bureaus or&#13;
companies directly providing key urban services.&#13;
1.14  Chinese cities are characterized by a good correspondence between expenditure&#13;
responsibility and control over revenue. This sets them apart from cities in many&#13;
developing countries, which have been characterized by inadequate funding to meet&#13;
mandated services. Chinese cities also tend to have well-staffed administrations, with&#13;
their broad control over the local economy making them an attractive employer. These&#13;
advantages have helped China achieve piped water supply to nearly 90 percent of all&#13;
urban residents, but has not automatically led to high levels of service in every field. The&#13;
low level of adequate solid waste disposal was cited earlier and local watercourses&#13;
continue to serve as both drains and sewers for nearly 40 percent of the area of Chinese&#13;
cities. Wastewater treatment levels are very low, with only 4.5 percent of municipal&#13;
flows treated in 1992. Cities have given priority to water supply, roads, and enterprise&#13;
investment over environmental services. Yet rapidly growing problems with raw water&#13;
quality are forcing recognition across cities that wastes need to be adequately handled.&#13;
1.15  The major policy problem identified in China: Urban Environmental Service&#13;
Management was the failure to charge, or charge adequately, for environmental services.&#13;
Although cities have long charged for water delivery, residential wastewater charges are&#13;
virtually unknown, while enterprise charges have been rare, and where collected tar&#13;
below operating needs. Solid waste collection fees are more often charged, but those&#13;
services still require substantial subsidies. An important consequence of this failure to&#13;
charge adequate user fees is that service investment programs have failed to meet goals&#13;
due to lack of finance. The Ministry of Construction estimates that two thirds of the&#13;
municipal wastewater treatment plants either do not operate, or operate far below&#13;
capacity, due to lack of funds. And, when users do not have to pay they have no&#13;
incentive to reduce waste volumes. This creates the need for larger service systems when&#13;
they are provided.&#13;
D. BANK GROUP SECTOR STRATEGY&#13;
1.16  The Bank Group highlighted enhancing environmental protection and alleviating&#13;
infrastructure bottlenecks as two of the four areas of concentration under the China&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) presented to the Board in June 1995. The Bank&#13;
Group's close collaboration with the Chinese government covers both the regulatory and&#13;
service provision  aspects of urban  environtnental management.   The China.&#13;
Environmental Strategy Paper sector study led to the Environmental Technical&#13;
Assistance Project noted earlier, which assists NEPA in its efforts to find more efficient&#13;
regulatory methods, improve staff capabilities, and bolster environmental monitoring.&#13;
That project complements Bank-administered but Japanese Government-financed&#13;
technical assistance to NEPA covering (a) the environmental impact assessment process;&#13;
(b) waste minimization and pollution control in rural industries; (c) hazardous/toxic waste&#13;
management; (d) economic/financial mechanisms for environmental management; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
(e) environmental information management systems. The Global Environmental Facility&#13;
has supported studies and projects on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the loss&#13;
of biodiversity in China,and reduced pollution in internatina water. The Montreal&#13;
Protocol Fund has supported a large program focused on reducing production of and&#13;
ozone-depleting substances. Finally, Beijing Municipality has joined with four other&#13;
Asian cities as members of the Metropolitan Environmental Improvement Progran&#13;
financed by UNDP and the World Bank.&#13;
1.17  In addition to national regulatory assistance, the Bank Group is currently involved&#13;
in five urban environmental projects in eight cities, which incorporate policy, financing&#13;
and organizational strategies for improved environmental regulation and service delivery&#13;
at the provincial and municipal levels.  Another four ongoing investment projects&#13;
involving 12 cities include related issues such as municipal water supply and sanitation.&#13;
The initial round of projects focused on China's largest cities-Shanghai, Beijing, and&#13;
Tianjin-and those located primarily in the wealthier northeast and coastal provinces.&#13;
Environmental pressures remain very high in those areas and cooperation will continue,&#13;
as with the recently appraised Second Shanghai Sewerage Project and the Shandong&#13;
Environment Project now being prepared.  However, the proposed Hubei Urban&#13;
Environmental Project marks a shift in geographic focus, moving toward inland and&#13;
poorer areas. Hubei, a medium income province, is located in central China, while&#13;
projects now being prepared in the very poor Yunnan and Guangxi provinces will further&#13;
test the feasibility of policy and institutional solutions.&#13;
1.18  A review of ongoing Bank Group projects in the sector in China and elsewhere&#13;
presents relevant lessons in pollution control and the provision and management of urban&#13;
environmental services.&#13;
1.19  The Bank experience in pollution control includes the projects in China, as well as&#13;
in Mexico, Brazil, India, Indonesia and the Russian Federation. A recent review of Bank&#13;
experience (Industry and Environment: Patterns in World Bank Lending) emphasizes the&#13;
need for political commitment, clear standards and regulations, incentives to comply, and&#13;
institutional capability to monitor and enforce standards. When industrial pollution&#13;
abatement subloans are involved, the following conditions increase likelihood of success:&#13;
a profitable and growing industrial sector, flexibility in choice of technology, availability&#13;
of funds at close-to-market terms, and targeting on sources that can yield significant&#13;
improvement in the ambient environment. The pollution abatement component draws on&#13;
these lessons and those in the two recent environmental sector studies. The latter stress&#13;
issues of political commitment, appropriate standards and incentives, and institutional&#13;
monitoring and enforcement capabilities. This project addresses those issues through an&#13;
environmental improvement action plan to strengthen the provincial and municipal EPBs&#13;
in Hubei to maximize project impact beyond the directly benefiting municipalities.&#13;
1.20  Bankwide municipal management sector work (Urban Service Delivery: Finding&#13;
the Right Incentives) emphasizes the need to properly assign functional responsibilities&#13;
and link revenue to expenditures.  In China's case, environmental services are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
appropriately provided at the municipal level, where a high percentage of government&#13;
revenue is also captured. China: Urban Environmental Service Management concludes&#13;
that the major failing in environmental services has been dependence on municipal&#13;
budget transfers to fund services, while greater reliance on user charges would be&#13;
affordable, induce resource conservation, and create a more dependable income stream.&#13;
For that reason, increasing tariffs has been a major focal point of the policy dialogue in&#13;
this project. This responds, too, to a major finding in the OED review of Bank water and&#13;
sanitation projects (Water Supply and Sanitation Projects: The Bank Experience 1967-&#13;
1989), wherein physical performance was generally good, but sustaining financial&#13;
viability and overall sectoral development was less successful. Adequate sector revenues&#13;
have been so crucial to successful operation of these investments that the Bank now sees the&#13;
needed tariff structures as the major sign of municipal commitment and therefore asks for&#13;
initial adjustments to be made during project processing. The proposed project follows this&#13;
model.&#13;
1.21  This project thus responds to Bank experience and CAS objectives, first through&#13;
an improved regulatory environment, reduction of current pollution loads, and protection&#13;
of critical water and land resources, and second through commercialization of operating&#13;
agencies, improved tariff policy, and modem operating techniques. The Bank's strategy&#13;
flows from and supports China's Environmental Action Plan and Agenda 21, which&#13;
provide the basis for joint Government and Bank action in the environmental sector,&#13;
especially in regard to the urban environment. Finally, the provincial focus recognizes&#13;
the effective decentralization of regulatory and investment authority in China, and draws&#13;
on local political power and commitment to induce wider use of the solutions&#13;
demonstrated under the project.&#13;

2. THE PROJECT AREA&#13;
A. EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS&#13;
2.1    Hubei Province, located in the mid-Yangtze River basin, supports a population of&#13;
55 million in an area roughly one third the size of France. Some 15 million people live in&#13;
Hubei's 31 cities, which are concentrated along the Han and Yangtze Rivers. Wuhan, the&#13;
provincial capital and China's fifth largest city with 3.9 million people, sits at the&#13;
confluence of the Han and Yangtze. The river systems have contributed to low transport&#13;
costs and good market access, which in turn have fostered 40 years of industrial and&#13;
commercial development at the national average pace. Hubei now ranks fourteenth&#13;
amnong the 30 provinces in per capita national income.&#13;
2.2   Hubei's industrial structure, based on steel, nonferrous metals, pulp and paper,&#13;
cement, and fertilizer and other chemicals, is one that demands relatively high investment&#13;
to control pollution. However, much of the plant and equipment predates China's and&#13;
Hubei's concern with environmental impacts. As a result, industrial air and water&#13;
pollution abatement faces an estimated investment backlog of several billion yuan to&#13;
bring plants into full compliance with existing discharge standards. Complicating the&#13;
compliance problem, many highly polluting plants are sited in heavily populated areas,&#13;
the result of a now discarded strategy to minimize infrastructure investment by colocating&#13;
industry with worker housing and social services. Polluting enterprises now pay some&#13;
Y 120 million ($14.3 million) annually in pollution levy fees. These fees, recycled as&#13;
earmarked pollution control investments, fall far short of the pollution abatement&#13;
financing requirements.&#13;
2.3    Municipal environmental services have also lagged. Sanitary landfills began&#13;
replacing uncontrolled dumping only in the last four years. By the early 1 990s, sewerage&#13;
systems captured only half of urban Hubei's wastewater (and only 7.2 percent c,f total&#13;
urban flows were treated, most of those at source by urban industries). The large average&#13;
annual flows in the Han (1,230 m3/sec) and Yangtze (23,800 m3/sec) provide excellent&#13;
dilution of urban and agricultural wastewater, but groundwater, lakes and smaller rivers&#13;
have not fared so well in the face of untreated industrial and domestic waste effluent&#13;
totaling about 2.7 billion m3/year. Industrial discharges currently account for about&#13;
58 percent of the total, although in line with national experience this proportion is&#13;
declining as water use quotas and recycling requirements hold industrial effluent volumes&#13;
steady. Also mirroring national experience, domestic waste discharges are increasing as&#13;
rapidly as 15 percent annually. Many urban lakes and rivers have become little more than&#13;
wastewater conveyors and sinks, with ambient water quality consistently below the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chinese standard for human contact. Air pollution in several cities ranks among the&#13;
worst in China.&#13;
2.4   The Central Government and Hubei Province have requested World Bank and&#13;
bilateral assistance to address these problems. Hubei Province identified four cities&#13;
which it considered were in urgent need of urban environmental service investments.&#13;
Three of these cities-Wuhan, Huangshi, and Yichang-are on the Yangtze River; the&#13;
fourth-Xiangfan-is on the Han River (see Annex 1). Major air polluters in an&#13;
additional two cities, Ezhou and Jingmen, were identified as creating particularly serious&#13;
damage. These six cities account for 60 percent of Hubei's urban population and&#13;
73 percent of the urban wastewater, 72 percent of TSP, and 82 percent of urban solid&#13;
waste loads in the province. Hubei Province and its cities know the major sources of&#13;
pollution, track their impact on the ambient environment, and have developed plans to&#13;
ameliorate their damage. Annual, five-year, and, for industry, 10-year abatement and&#13;
investment plans have been developed that incorporate regulatory, institutional, and&#13;
investment responses&#13;
B. REGULATORY STRATEGIES&#13;
2.5    Hubei Province and the Hubei Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau&#13;
(HEPB) have developed an Environmental Improvement Action Plan (see Annex 11) that&#13;
relies on:&#13;
*     regulatory instruments&#13;
*     financial disincentives&#13;
*     positive financial incentives&#13;
*     research and training&#13;
2.6   The main regulatory instruments are those of environmental assessment,&#13;
licensing, and fees for excess discharges described earlier. The province has, in addition,&#13;
decided to move from concentration-based to mass-based discharge control, as a means of&#13;
better matching discharges to assimilative capacity. Successful implementation of the&#13;
mass-based discharge program has been established as a key indicator of regulatory&#13;
innovation. The time-based implementation plan will be matched by a research program&#13;
to track effectiveness of this new approach.&#13;
2.7   Financial disincentives are based on the pollution fee levied on excess discharges.&#13;
The action plan takes collection rates of the levy fee as a key measure of regulatory&#13;
efficiency. Current collections amount to about 40 percent of estimated obligations, a&#13;
seemingly low rate, but in line with national experience. The province proposes to&#13;
increase the collection rate by 50 percent over tive years.  Success on both counts&#13;
depends on the commitment of provincial and city political leaders, who must back the&#13;
EPBs in their attempts to control pollution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
2.8    While levy fee payment acts as a disincentive to polluters, availability of&#13;
earmarked pollution abatement funds can be structured to provide a positive incentive for&#13;
cleaner production. Hubei has joined other provinces in shifting the earmarked pollution&#13;
levy fees from a grant to loan system. The loan funds remain under the control of the&#13;
municipal and county EPBs, with as yet few attempts to improve procedures under which&#13;
enterprises gain use of the funds or have that use evaluated. In many cases, the funds&#13;
automatically flow back to the paying enterprise, which prevents their systematic&#13;
application to the most serious pollution problems. The provincial EPB now seeks&#13;
provincial government support for shifting a portion of the pollution levy fees to a Hubei&#13;
Environmental Pollution Control Fund (HEPCF). The Fund would experiment with&#13;
improved targeting and evaluation procedures while targeting loans to the previously&#13;
neglected small-scale enterprise sector. They also seek project participation in this Fund&#13;
through a $5 million loan, which would parallel efforts under Bank-supported projects in&#13;
other provinces.&#13;
2.9    To further strengthen enterprise financial incentives for meeting mandated&#13;
pollution control goals, the province sought to include a line of credit for industrial&#13;
pollution control within the proposed project. With a proposed $45 million allocation,&#13;
the line of credit would provide a fund three times the size of the annual pollution levy&#13;
fee collections. Eligibility for the line of credit was restricted in the first instance to the&#13;
117 most polluting industrial enterprises in Hubei, which are responsible for over&#13;
60 percent of Hubei's industrial pollution. These enterprises were then evaluated on the&#13;
toxicity of their pollutants and the population within the catchment affected by the&#13;
pollution. The top-ranked firms were then subject to a simple economic screening that&#13;
eliminated (a) all enterprises that had a negative net worth and were losing money and&#13;
(b) any enterprise whose abatement strategy depended on production of a commodity line&#13;
in which the enterprise had no prior experience.  With priority based on their&#13;
environmental impact, remaining firms were then eligible for more thorough technical,&#13;
financial, and economic appraisal, which, if satisfactory, would give them access to the&#13;
line of credit. The line of credit would be limited to financing goods and equipment.&#13;
Line-of-credit terms would include a substantial positive real interest rate, but a longer&#13;
repayment period than normally available in Chinese commercial loans. The longer&#13;
repayment period would be key to feasible financing plans and speed earlier resolution of&#13;
some major pollution problems.&#13;
2.10   Enterprises whose profit levels will not support the major pollution control&#13;
investments many of them need present a particular challenge for the provincial and&#13;
municipal governments. The province annually identifies those polluters for whom&#13;
regulatory sanctions and earmarked or other loan funds alone will not induce compliance,&#13;
then must decide whether to shut them down or identify sources of capital to finance&#13;
process change or end-of-pipe treatment. This important aspect of the Action Plan poses&#13;
some of the greatest difficulties, as it is intimately linked with overall state-owned&#13;
enterprise reform. With enterprises now bearing many of the social security obligations&#13;
that will be borne or managed by the state after the transition, plant closing woulcd leave&#13;
workers with neither the security of their jobs nor the protection of labor insurance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- II -&#13;
programs. The annual provincial program recognizes that solutions may be beyond&#13;
municipal resources and therefore takes the lead in developing solutions to exemplary&#13;
problems.&#13;
2.11   Research and training complement the above efforts. The planned research on&#13;
mass-based discharge license effectiveness has been noted earlier. Other topics for&#13;
analysis include the contribution of rural enterprise to provincial pollution loads (as a first&#13;
step to improving regulation of that sector) and low cost interventions for pollution&#13;
control in the small-scale paper and chemical industries. The training program would&#13;
help EPB staff at the provincial and municipal level gain the skills needed to improve&#13;
their work. The project includes a technical assistance component designed to support&#13;
Hubei's implementation of the Action Plan. The technical assistance package would&#13;
provide funds for the research program and to allow an expanded training program,&#13;
especially in areas where the HEPB could take advantage of foreign experience and&#13;
expertise. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Hubei Provincial&#13;
Government (HPG) would (a) carry out the agreed Environmental Improvement Action&#13;
Plan, including annual improvements in pollution levy fee collection efficiency, meeting&#13;
the discharge permit implementation timetable; completing the agreed research&#13;
program; and implementing the staff training program; and (b) report to the Bank, not&#13;
later than June 30 at each year, on progress in meeting Plan goals and additional actions&#13;
to be taken to implement the Plan.. Technical assistance for this effort will be provided&#13;
through the proposed loan/credit [para. 3.3(d)].&#13;
C. INSTITUTIONAL STRATEGIES&#13;
2.12  Efficient and sustainable delivery of municipal environmental services depends on&#13;
the establishment of appropriate institutions to manage those services. Current practice in&#13;
Hubei cities, as in most of China, relies on city owned, but financially autonomous,&#13;
enterprises to run water systems, while city government bureaus relying on normal&#13;
budgetary transfers manage wastewater collection and treatment and solid waste&#13;
collection and disposal. Those organizational choices match traditional financial goals,&#13;
which sought self-sufficiency for water companies but considered wastewater and solid&#13;
waste disposal to be welfare services.&#13;
2.13  The traditional organization and practices in wastewater and solid waste make it&#13;
very difficult for Hubei's cities to charge the tariffs needed if polluters are to pay the full&#13;
cost of abatement services and funds for service expansion are to be found.  The&#13;
managing bureaus do not depreciate fixed assets, so cannot identify the true cost of&#13;
service provision. Nor do their accounting practices provide managers with the financial&#13;
tools needed for efficient management. An important element of the proposed project&#13;
would be the establishment, in three project cities, of financially autonomous wastewater&#13;
agencies, organized under enterprise accounting rules, able to charge tariffs adequate to&#13;
cover operating and maintenance costs and the greater of debt service or depreciation.&#13;
Environmental sanitation bureaus, which handle solid wastes, face a more difficult&#13;
challenge in efficiently identifying and billing household users. For these bureaus, cost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
accounting techniques would be introduced that permit them to identify the cost of&#13;
operations, and they would be expected to charge those full costs to the commercial and&#13;
industrial users of their services.&#13;
2.14  The proposed institutional innovations under this project move provision of these&#13;
important environmental services much closer to an enterprise model than the current&#13;
government bureau model. After the changes have been implemented, for the first time&#13;
municipal managers will be able to know the cost of the different components of service&#13;
provision and therefore be in a position to decide whether further innovations, such as&#13;
contracting with independent operators for some or all of the services would promise&#13;
further efficiency gains.  The details of the institutional goals and structures are&#13;
elaborated in Chapter 4.&#13;
2.15  The project provides wide-ranging technical assistance to the new operating&#13;
agencies. One technical assistance package (Package A) would help the implementing&#13;
agencies introduce new accounting systems and management information systems. A&#13;
second element of that package would build on the accounting outputs to design tariff&#13;
structures to meet the new financial goals. A second package (Package B) would focus&#13;
on physical operation of the new and existing services. This would range from system&#13;
operator training to investment planning for system expansion (see para. 3.3).&#13;
D. INVESTMENT STRATEGIES&#13;
2.16  The policy and institutional initiatives must be accompanied by investment in&#13;
environmental services if environmental quality gains are to be had.  Each of the&#13;
participating cities has ambitious long run sector investment programs and each is&#13;
seriously constrained by intersectoral competition for current revenues. The following&#13;
discussion lays out the background to actions in each sector. The actual investment&#13;
choices are described in the next chapter and in Annex 2.&#13;
2.17  Wastewater Management. The water quality problems of Hubei's cities arise&#13;
from untreated, mainly industrial, wastewater discharging to lakes, rivers and streams,&#13;
sometimes close to the cities' water supply intakes. While between 80 and 90 percent of&#13;
Hubei's urban population are served by septic tanks, which capture most solids and&#13;
provide some treatment, where sewerage systems are absent, the liquid fraction&#13;
discharges to the nearest natural drainage. When wastewater flows do enter sewerage&#13;
systems, these are typically combined systems that also handle stormwater. Three cities&#13;
would benefit from wastewater investments under the project. Only two of the cities-&#13;
Huangshi and Wuhan-now  have treatment plants for municipal sewerage.  The&#13;
Huangshi plant, which treats 70 percent industrial waste and 30 percent domestic waste,&#13;
operates at about 70 percent of capacity and treats less than 20 percent of total flows. The&#13;
recently commissioned Wuhan plant, which serves part of one city district, has operated&#13;
sporadically due to lack of operating funds.&#13;
2.18  The financial problems underlying treatment plant operation will be addressed&#13;
through the policy and institutional development activities already described. Collection&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
system expansion will rely on conventional sewers, as lower cost alternatives are not&#13;
available in these densely populated areas. Substantial investments are needed simply to&#13;
divert wastewater from the rivers and lakes within the built-up areas and this will be the&#13;
focus of investments under the proposed project.  With sewers in place, treatment&#13;
becomes possible, but high investment costs prevent treatment goals to be fully realized&#13;
at this stage. The treatment strategy under the project is to provide primary treatment&#13;
where discharges continue to lakes and preliminary treatment for discharges to the Han or&#13;
Yangtze, with their high assimilative capacity.  During negotiations, assurances were&#13;
obtained from HPG that it would cause Huangshi, Wuhan and Xiangfan Municipalities,&#13;
by December 31, 1996, to develop and thereafter implement a time-bound Action Plan&#13;
acceptable to the Bank for the connection to their municipal sewerage system of all&#13;
wastewater discharge from buildings and septic tanks located within 100 meters of said&#13;
systein.&#13;
2.19 Solid Waste and Nightsoil Management. Few municipal landfills in Hubei&#13;
meet accepted national or international standards. In 1991, only 5 percent of municipal&#13;
wastes were deemed to have been safely disposed of. The remainder went to dumps&#13;
providing no protection from leachate contamination for underlying aquifers or local&#13;
surface waters, nor any collection and flaring of landfill gas. Solid waste leachate and the&#13;
migration of polluted surface waters share blame for the high levels of urban aquifer&#13;
contamination in Hubei. The landfill gas contributes to global warming, but the lack of&#13;
collection systems also poses the hazard of uncontrolled burning in the dumps. On the&#13;
positive side, Chinese, and Hubei's, cities do a good job of collecting solid waste.&#13;
Although unsightly and malodorous collection points are a major source of citizen&#13;
environmental complaint, frequent garbage collection succeeds in minimizing potential&#13;
health hazards from this source. Engineering analysis of collection and transfer activities&#13;
suggests that economies can be had from reduced handling and transport in large&#13;
compression vehicles rather than the common practice of using smaller, open trucks. The&#13;
proposed project helps four cities construct landfills meeting national and international&#13;
standards. Technical assistance under the project will help them implement accounting&#13;
systems that for the first time allow them to track costs by system component. This, in&#13;
turn, will allow them to evaluate alternative strategies for waste collection, using the&#13;
experience with the new vehicle types purchased under the project.&#13;
2.20  Environmental sanitation bureaus also take responsibility for municipal nightsoil&#13;
handling. In the four project cities, some 30 percent of the urban population have access&#13;
only to dry latrines or public toilets. Those, and the septic tanks that collect the solids&#13;
from private flush toilets, must be pumped at regular intervals. Until the early 1980s.&#13;
suburban farms had a high demand for nightsoil and many rural collectives removed&#13;
urban nightsoil at no cost to the city. More recently, broad availability of chemical&#13;
fertilizer has led to diminishing nightsoil use in rural communities and increased nightsoil&#13;
handling costs to cities. Cities now deliver the nightsoil to rural dumping stations, where&#13;
good practice relies on fermentation to kill parasites, bacteria and viruses before use in&#13;
agriculture and aquaculture. However, current dumping station designs have not met&#13;
sanitation targets. The proposed project would support existing city programs to replace&#13;

E. PROJECT FORMULATION&#13;
2.21  Recognizing the pressures on Hubei's urban environment, the Central&#13;
Government has approached the World Bank for support in funding a long-term&#13;
investment program in environmental protection in the province. At the same time, HPG&#13;
recognizes environmental protection as a prerequisite for long-term economic growth and&#13;
gives investments in environmental protection high priority. During project preparation it&#13;
was found that most municipal planning was done only up to the year 2000. Given that&#13;
some of the proposed project investments would not be completed until about 2002,&#13;
planning under this project used growth projections to the year 2010 in siting and sizing&#13;
investments.&#13;
2.22  HPG directed the Hubei Urban Environment Project Office (HUEPO-see para.&#13;
4.1), to coordinate the preparation, and subsequently monitor the execution, of the&#13;
proposed project. HUEPO has retained foreign and local consultants and local design&#13;
institutes to help prepare the project.  The collaboration of foreign consultants in&#13;
preparation work for the proposed wastewater and water quality monitoring components&#13;
was financed by the Australian Agency for International Development (AUSAID) and the&#13;
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). The Japanese Policy and Human&#13;
Resources Development (PHRD) fund supported preparation of the solid waste and&#13;
industrial pollution control components. The proposed wastes management component&#13;
preparation was assisted through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)&#13;
funded Regional Water Supply and Sanitation Group-East Asia Program.&#13;

C. PROJECT COST ESTIMATES&#13;
3.4   The estimated cost of the project, including contingencies and local duties and&#13;
taxes, is Y 3,344.7 million ($370.2 million). The foreign exchange component is Y 952.3&#13;
million ($104.7 million), or about 28 percent of project costs. Local customs duties and&#13;
taxes are estimated at Y 110.8 million ($11.65 million). The total financing required,&#13;
which includes $15.0 million of interest during construction, is $385.2 million (Y 3,481.2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
million). A summary of cost estimates is given in Table 3.1 below. Detailed cost&#13;
estimates are provided in Annex 3.&#13;
3.5   Base cost estimates are based on preliminary engineering designs, and reflect&#13;
price levels expected to prevail in December 1995, based on current inflation rates. The&#13;
unit prices were derived from the following sources: (a) quotations obtained from&#13;
manufacturers and suppliers; (b) prices of goods and works from recent contracts; and&#13;
(c) construction costs published by the central and Hubei Governments, all adjusted for&#13;
inflation. Physical contingencies of 15 percent have been applied to base costs for most&#13;
components, except for vehicles and mechanical equipment of the wastes management&#13;
component, where 10 percent has been adopted to reflect higher confidence in the&#13;
estimated costs of this component. Construction Management and Services costs of&#13;
2.5 percent of the civil works and materials and equipment costs of the wastewater&#13;
cormponent, and 1.25 percent of the civil works of the wastes management component,&#13;
have been included in the project cost estimates. Project management and engineering&#13;
overhead costs of 12 percent are also included.&#13;
3.6   Price contingencies have been applied to expenditures at projected global foreign&#13;
and local inflation rates. In view of the large variation between foreign and local price&#13;
contingency projections, the $/Yuan exchange rate has been assumed to vary in order to&#13;
maintain purchasing power parity. The inflation rate projections used are as follows:&#13;
Parameter        1996    1997    1998    1999        2000      2001      2002&#13;

3.8   The IBRD loan and IDA credit would be made to the People's Republic of China.&#13;
The IBRD loan of $125 million equivalent would be for a 20-year tenn, including a five&#13;
year grace period on standard Bank terms. The IDA credit of SDR 16.8 million ($25&#13;
million equivalent) would be for a 35-year term, including a 10-year grace period on&#13;
standard Association terms. The proceeds of the loan and credit would be made available&#13;
to HP on the following terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank/IDA: the loan at the&#13;
Bank's standard variable interest rate, for a 20-year period including a five-year grace&#13;
period, and a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per year, and the credit at the&#13;
Association's standard service charge for a 20-year period, including a five-year grace&#13;
period, and a commitment charge of 0.50 percent per year. Hubei Province would bear the&#13;
foreign exchange risk. HP would make industrial pollution control subloans available to&#13;
industrial enterprises at a rate equal to the Bank's standard variable interest rate plus a&#13;
spread of not less than 1.5 percent per year, with the enterprises bearing a commitment&#13;
charge of 0.75 percent and the foreign exchange risk; the grace period would be up to 3&#13;
years, and the maturity up to 12 years. HP would allocate part of the proceeds to the&#13;
municipalities on the same terms as received from China. The municipalities would&#13;
onlend the proceeds of the loan/credit allocated to them to the wastewater entities for 15&#13;
years, including a five year grace period, at a rate equal to the Bank's standard variable&#13;
interest rate, with the entities bearing the commitment charges and the foreign exchange&#13;
risk. Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations.&#13;
3.9   Execution  of subsidiary  loan  agreements  between  the  participating&#13;
muunicipalities and their wastewater entities, satisfactory to the Bank/lIDA, is a condition&#13;
of effectiveness. A separate Project Agreement, including operational, financial and&#13;
monitoring covenants, would be executed between HP and IBRD/IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
3.10  About $5.0 million equivalent of loan/credit proceeds would be onlent by HP&#13;
from a revolving credit facility (the Hubei Environmental Pollution Control Fund-&#13;
HEPCF) to participating enterprises for eligible small scale pollution control subprojects.&#13;
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that (a) HP, through the HEPCF, would&#13;
onlend to participating enterprises at a rate equal to the Bank's standard variable&#13;
interest rate plus a spread of not less than 1.5 percent per year, with the enterprises&#13;
bearing a commitment charge of 0.75percent and the foreign exchange risk. The&#13;
maturity would be for three to five years, including a one to two year period of grace.&#13;
Subloan repayments would be recycledfor additional pollution control subprojects to the&#13;
extent not needed to repay China; and (b) HP would, through HEPB allocate to HEPCF&#13;
a total of about Y 45.0 million of pollution levy fees over the three fiscal years&#13;
commencing 1996, annually depositing with HEPCF at least Y 1S million by June 30 of&#13;
each such year.&#13;
E. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.11  Procurement procedures and arrangements satisfactory to the Bank/IDA would be&#13;
agreed upon with HPG. All procurement activities will be organized through the&#13;
International Tendering Company of China National Instruments Import and Export&#13;
Corporation (CNIITC), which has been contracted by HUEPO (para. 4.1) to carry out the&#13;
work. CNIITC is an experienced and competent procurement agent which is familiar&#13;
with, and has had recent and relevant experience in international competitive bidding&#13;
(ICB) work on Bank/IDA-financed projects. The tender documents to be used in the&#13;
project would be based on the standard bid documents prepared by the Ministry of&#13;
Finance and approved by the World Bank Group. All civil works contracts would be&#13;
grouped whenever practical into bid packages estimated to cost the equivalent of $10&#13;
million or more each, and contracts for goods shall be grouped into packages estimated to&#13;
cost the equivalent of $200,000 or more each, to attract maximum international&#13;
competition.  Prequalification of bidders would be undertaken for all civil works&#13;
contracts with an estimated value over $6.0 million equivalent each. Annex 4 lists the&#13;
Schedule of Contract Packages and the method of procurement, and Table 3.3&#13;
summarizes the procurement categories and the expected procurement methods. The&#13;
contract packages and the method of procurement have been agreed with HUEPO.&#13;
3.12  Civil Works.  Excluding the industrial and environmental pollution control&#13;
components, there is a total of about $1 14.6 million of civil works of which about $44.2&#13;
million (39 percent) would be procured using ICB procedures.  Qualified domestic&#13;
contractors under ICB will be eligible for a 7.5 percent preference in bid evaluation, in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines-January 1995. ICB procedures&#13;
would be used for all civil works contracts of estimated value of $10.0 million or more (i.e.,&#13;
three contracts). All remaining civil works are too small, scattered or scheduled too far&#13;
apart to be packaged to be of interest to foreign firms. Of the remaining works, about $69.5&#13;
million would be awarded through national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures,&#13;
acceptable to the Bank/IDA.  The NCB procedures recently promulgated by the&#13;
Government have been reviewed and approved by the World Bank Group. Interested&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
foreign bidders would be allowed to bid for NCB contracts. The Water Quality Monitoring&#13;
component works would not be Bank financed.&#13;

3.13  Equipment and Materials. Excluding the industrial and environmental pollution&#13;
control components, there is a total of about $61.6 million of equipment and materials in the&#13;
project, of which about $55.2 million (90 percent) would be procured using ICB&#13;
procedures. Qualified domestic bidders will be eligible for a preference in bid evaluation of&#13;
15 percent or customs duties and import tax payable by a non exempt importer, whichever&#13;
is less. All equipment and materials with individual contract values of $200,000 or more&#13;
equivalent would be procured using ICB procedures.&#13;
3.14  Equipment and materials with individual contract values less than $200,000&#13;
equivalent would be awarded using NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank, up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of $1.0 million. Contracts costing less than $50,000 equivalent up to&#13;
an aggregate amount of $1.65 million, would be procured through international or&#13;
national shopping procedures with at least three price quotations.&#13;
3.15  Industrial  Pollution  Control  Component.    Under  the  line-of-credit&#13;
subcomponent, the People's Construction Bank of China (PCBC), Hubei Branch, would&#13;
review the contract packages and the methods of procurement.  The procedures for&#13;
procurement would be the same as those for Bank Group-financed PCBC projects which&#13;
the Bank has reviewed and found satisfactory. Individual contracts with an estimated value&#13;
of $5 million or more would be procured under ICB. Contracts below $5 million and not&#13;
less than $200,000 would be awarded through International Shopping, after evaluation and&#13;
comparison of quotations solicited from at least three qualified suppliers from at least three&#13;
countries. Contracts below $200,000 would be awarded through National Shopping, after&#13;
evaluation and comparison of quotations solicited from at least three qualified suppliers.&#13;
These contracts would be subject to post-review by the Bank Group, and PCBC would&#13;
maintain all relevant documents in its records for this purpose.&#13;
3.16  Environmental  Pollution  Control Component.    Under the  HEPCF&#13;
subcomponent, in which no loan will exceed $500,000, contracts for equipment and&#13;
materials financed through HEPCF subloans would be awarded after solicitation and&#13;
evaluation through international or national shopping procedures of at least three written&#13;
price quotations from eligible suppliers. This is consistent with procedures that the Bank&#13;
Group has reviewed and found satisfactory.&#13;
3.17  Technical Assistance and Training. All consultants to be retained under the&#13;
project would be recruited in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executing Agency-&#13;
August, 1981". National consultants and counterpart staff would be engaged or assigned by&#13;
the concerned agencies of Hubei Province. Consultants have already been retained for&#13;
project preparation and design (para. 2.22). At negotiations, HP provided a copy of a&#13;
signed contract, acceptable to the Bank/IDA, with a consultant firmn for Package B&#13;
(construction management and supervision of the works to be constructed under the project,&#13;
and sector institutional strengthening). HPG anticipates signing a contract with a consulting&#13;
firm for Package A (financial) by loan effectiveness. The Terms of Reference for these&#13;
consultancy services are in the Project File (Annex 15).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
3.18  Review of Bid Documents and Contracts. All civil works packages in excess of&#13;
$2 million (about 14 contracts, 84 percent of the works), and all equipment and materials&#13;
contracts of $1 million or more (about eight contracts, 83 percent of the equipment and&#13;
materials), would be subject to the Bank/IDA's normal prior review, including&#13;
prequalification, notice of invitation to bid, bid documents, bid evaluation and contracts.&#13;
The threshold for prior review of contracts for consultants would be $100,000 equivalent&#13;
for firms and $50,000 for individual contracts. For contracts below the threshold, prior&#13;
review will apply to terms of reference, single source selection, assignments of a critical&#13;
nature, and any amendments that would raise contract value above the prior review&#13;
threshold. Other contracts would also be subject to selective post-award review.&#13;
3.19  Prequalification.  The Standard Prequalification Document for the People's&#13;
Republic of China, issued by the Ministry of Finance and approved by the World Bank&#13;
Group, would be used for preparing the invitation document. HUEPO and CNIITC hold&#13;
copies of this document (together with standard bidding documents for ICB and NCB&#13;
works and goods invitations).&#13;
F. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
3.20  The proposed IBRD Loan of $125 million and IDA Credit of $25 million&#13;
equivalent would be disbursed over a period of about six and a half years, consistent with&#13;
the Bank's latest urban sector disbursement profile for China. Disbursements would be&#13;
as indicated below.&#13;

3.21   To expedite disbursements, a Special Account with an authorized allocation of&#13;
$8.0 million, representing about four months' average disbursements, would be&#13;
established. It would be replenished monthly or whenever the Special Account is drawn&#13;
down to 50 percent of its initial value, whichever occurs first. Disbursements would be&#13;
made against statements of expenditure (SOEs), certified by HUEPO, for: (a) contracts&#13;
for (i) civil works valued at less than $2 million; and (ii) equipment and materials costing&#13;
less than $1 million equivalent; (b) contracts for consulting services costing less than&#13;
$100,000 equivalent for firrns and $50,000 equivalent for individuals; and (c) training.&#13;
Documents supporting the SOEs would be retained by HUEPO and made available for&#13;
inspection during the course of Bank/IDA supervision missions and external auditors.&#13;
All other disbursements will be made against fully documented expenditures.  A&#13;
Schedule of Disbursements is given in Annex 5. To facilitate efficient and prompt startup&#13;
of the project, continued progress on final design begun during project preparation, and&#13;
contruction of access roads and other preparatory works needed to avoid delays,&#13;
retroactive financing of up to SDR 7.0 million ($10.5 million equivalent, seven percent of&#13;
the value of the loan and credit) would be provided for expenditures incurred after&#13;
September 1, 1995, covering initial civil works and goods contracts, and consulting&#13;
services. The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2001, and, therefore, the&#13;
Loan/Credit Closing Date would be June 30, 2002.&#13;
3.22   The (a) execution of afinancial agency agreement with a bank, satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank/lIDA, for the Jinancial, economic and technical appraisal of suibprojects under the&#13;
Industrial Pollution Control Line-of-Credit subcomponent (paras. 4.10-4.11); and&#13;
(b) approval, by the Bank, of an operational manual governing HEPCF subloan&#13;
processing and approvals, and the execution of an acceptable financial agency&#13;
agreement between HEPCF and a bank for HEPCF subloan processing (para. 4.12)&#13;
would be conditions of disbursement for the loan/credit proceeds allocated to the&#13;
respective Industrical and Environmental Pollution Control components. Completion to&#13;
the satisfaction of the Bank/lIDA, of a feasibility study, detailed designs, environmental&#13;
assessment (EA), anid a land acquisition and resettlement plan for a proposed landfill in&#13;
Xiangfan (para. 4.18) would be a condition of disbursement for the Xiangfan Solid Vaste&#13;
component.&#13;
G. LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
3.23  Several project components would require the acquisition of land and resettlement&#13;
of current users. These include the municipal components in Yichang, Xiangfan,&#13;
Huangshi, and Wuhan, and four of the six preidentified applicants for the industrial&#13;
pollution control line of credit (para. 4.11). Resettlement impacts include the permanent&#13;
relocation of 39 farnilies, the temporary relocation of 137 families, and new employment&#13;
for some 996 people. Permanent relocation is spread across four communities and all&#13;
households will resettle within their original administrative village boundaries. The&#13;
temporary relocation will all occur in Xiangfan Municipality and is estimated to last less&#13;
than a month. It is needed to protect householders while a wastewater conveyor trench is&#13;
dug adjacent to their houses and the contractor repairs any damage resulting from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
trencling. The employment impact will be spread across several communities. In most&#13;
cases, displaced workers will be given new jobs in their current company, or on land or in&#13;
companies owned by the collective of which they are currently members. In other cases,&#13;
the collective or project unit will take responsibility for placing the affected worker in&#13;
suitable outside employment or, if the worker so desires, provide financing for self-&#13;
employment. For both housing and employment resettlement, the project agencies have&#13;
allocated funds and taken other measures to ensure that resettler's standards of living are&#13;
maintained or improved.  A  Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), acceptable to the&#13;
Bank/IDA has been received. A summary of the RAP is presented in Annex 6.&#13;
3.24   All project cities have experienced, specialized teams responsible for resettlement&#13;
administration and the first round of consultation with affected communities has been&#13;
completed. The implementation of the RAP will be monitored by the municipal and&#13;
provincial project offices in addition to the monitoring obligations assumed by municipal&#13;
governments for all involuntary resettlement within their boundaries.  To provide&#13;
additional protection to resettler interests, technical assistance funds in Package B (para.&#13;
3.3) will be used to finance periodic independent evaluation of the resettlement work. If&#13;
not incorporated in the approved RAP, candidates for subloans will be analyzed for&#13;
possible resettlement. Where resettlement would occur, a separate RAP, acceptable to the&#13;
Bank/IDA, will be a prerequisite for the subloan approval. Once site selection is&#13;
contirmede for the Xiangfan landfill, a RAP will be prepared for that site. Any change in&#13;
project design will also be analyzed for possible resettlement impact and, if such impacts&#13;
exist, the RAP would be amended, in a manner acceptable to the Bank/IDA, as necessary&#13;
to reflect such changes. During negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom HPG that it&#13;
would carry ouit or cause to be carried out resettlement ofpersons affected by the project&#13;
in a manner and according to the Resettlement Action Plan satisfactory to the Bank/IDA.&#13;
H. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT&#13;
3.25   The proposed project would have a positive environmental impact.  It is a&#13;
Category A project according to the Operational Directive classification, principally on&#13;
account of the four proposed landfills. In accordance with Chinese regulations, an EA&#13;
was prepared that covered all project components. The EA was reviewed by HEPB and&#13;
the World Bank Group and found to be satisfactory; it is summarized in Annex 7. While&#13;
the project would remove substantial pollution loads, some possible side effects have&#13;
been identified and mitigative measures developed during the EA process. In particular,&#13;
appropriate arrangements have been made for the beneficial use, wherever possible, of&#13;
construction spoil, and for the use in agriculture of sludge from wastewater treatment.&#13;
Similarly, the siting of wastewater treatment plants minimizes impact upon residential&#13;
areas and the discharges are to watercourses where the residual pollution load may be&#13;
assimilated without significant detriment to local water quality. Candidates for subloans&#13;
or any change in project scope will be analyzed for possible environmental impact.&#13;
Where the possibility of adverse impact is identified, an EA will be prepared that meets&#13;
Chinese requirements and is satisfactory to the Bank/IDA.  During negotiations,&#13;
assurances were obtainedfrom HPG that it would carry out or cause to be carried out, in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
a manner satisfactory to the Bank/IDA, the mitigation plans specified in the&#13;
Environmental Impact Assessment.&#13;
1. PROJECT MONITORING, REPORTING AND SUPERVISION&#13;
3.26   The proposed project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 8. Operational&#13;
and financial monitoring indicators for the agencies are given in the Finance section&#13;
(Chapter 5), and the assumptions to the financial projections are provided in Annex 13.&#13;
The format and content of project progress reports and project impact monitoring&#13;
indicators and methodology were discussed and confirmed during negotiations.&#13;
3.27   Project impact would be monitored with respect to the objectives, for which the&#13;
key indicators are summarized below. The expected level of the performnance indicators is&#13;
based on timely implementation of the project components summarized in para. 3.2 and&#13;
detailed in Annex 2.&#13;

3.28  During negotiations, assurances were obtained that quarterly reports on project&#13;
progress would be prepared by each implementing agency and consolidated by HUEPO,&#13;
then sent to the Bank/IDA by the thirtieth day of January, April, and October of each year,&#13;
commencing in January 1996. An annual report due on or about July 30 each year&#13;
would integrate the results of the quarterly reports from the preceding 12 months, The&#13;
following understanding was obtained during negotiations and recorded in the minutes of&#13;
negotiations: that the last progress report of each year would include the latest project&#13;
cost estimate and financing plan for the following year, including HP 's draft budget fbr&#13;
local counterpart funds. An implementation completion report, reviewing the planned&#13;
objectives and the achievements of the project, including costs and benefits derived, and&#13;
performance and contribution of all parties associated with project execution, would be&#13;
prepared by HP and submitted to the Bank/IDA within six months of the Closing Date.&#13;
DIuring negotiations, assurances were obtained that, not later than six months c£fter the&#13;
('losing Date, or such later date as may be agreed between the HP and the Bank/IDA,&#13;
HP would (a) prepare and submit to the Bank/lIDA, a plan for the future operation of the&#13;
investments financed under the project; and (b) afford the Bank/lIDA a reasonable&#13;
opportunity to exchange views on said plan.&#13;
3.29  To facilitate implementation, a Project Launch Workshop would be held in early&#13;
1996. Project supervision would monitor impact with respect to the objectives (para.&#13;
3.27), and focus on key sector issues such as utility pricing and environmental regulatory&#13;
effectiveness.  Bank experience with supervision of the ongoing Liaoning Urban&#13;
Infrastructure and Environment Projects, which, like the proposed project, are multicity&#13;
projects, suggests that Bank/IDA supervision would require about 85 staff-weeks over the&#13;
life of the project, of which about 25 staff-weeks would be at headquarters for the review&#13;
of progress and audit reports, procurement actions and correspondence, etc., and 60 staff-&#13;
weeks would be in the field. More intensive supervision would be required during the&#13;
first three years of the project, during which time the technical assistance would be made&#13;
operational and many procurement contracts would have been tendered, evaluated and&#13;
awarded. Supervision would be provided by environmental engineering and financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30-&#13;
staff, as well as other specialists, as needed. The Project Supervision Plan is shown in&#13;
Annex 9.&#13;
3.30   A mid-term review tentatively scheduled for late 1997, would be held to assess&#13;
the progress in implementation of the various components of the project. A key issue for&#13;
the review would be the possible reallocation of loan/credit proceeds from&#13;
underperforming municipalities to better performing municipalities, as an incentive for&#13;
strong municipal performance. The mid-term review mission would pay particular&#13;
attention to utility tariffs, environmental regulation, and associated policy issues critical&#13;
to project and sector success.&#13;

4. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. PROJECT MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.1   The Hubei Environmental Protection Committee (HEPC), established in 1989,&#13;
has responsibility for the formulation of environmental policies and coordination of&#13;
environmental protection matters. It is headed by a vice-governor with support from the&#13;
deputy directors of Hubei Province Economic Commission, Hubei Province Planning&#13;
Commission, Hubei Province Science and Technology Commission, Hubei&#13;
Environmental Protection Bureau, Hubei Province Finance Bureau, and at least 16 other&#13;
representatives of at least the deputy director level representing a wide spectrum of&#13;
industry and government organizations. An organizational chart of the Hubei Provincial&#13;
Government is presented in Annex I O.  HEPC designated HEPB as the agency&#13;
responsible for managing the project. This Bureau organized and staffed HUEPO to&#13;
prepare and execute the project, including the supervision and monitoring of contracts,&#13;
maintenance of project records, and the submission of progress reports to the Bank/IDA&#13;
(para. 3.28). Environmental Protection Committees were set up in each of the project&#13;
municipalities, under which municipal project offices were established. During project&#13;
preparation, HUEPO and the municipal project offices received regular policy guidance&#13;
from their respective committees. These committees were headed by senior officials of&#13;
government: the Vice-Governor in the case of Hubei Province, and at least vice-mayor&#13;
rank in the project municipalities. The municipal project offices in turn created and&#13;
staffed subproject offices in each of the implementing agencies. HUEPO provides&#13;
functional guidance to the municipal project offices.&#13;
4.2   HUEPO has interacted well with the various project offices and consultants,&#13;
expedited resources to undertake preparation, and arranged for the project preparation&#13;
work to be completed to the satisfaction of HPG and the Bank/IDA, resulting in the&#13;
project having been appraised satisfactorily.  HUEPO would have the following&#13;
responsibilities during project implementation:&#13;
(a)   overall project coordination, macro-level project management and&#13;
monitoring:&#13;
(b)   annual budget preparation;&#13;
(c)   project-wide quality assurance;&#13;
(d)   progress reporting to HPG and the Bank/IDA, including cost management,&#13;
project impact and environmental improvement assessment;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
(e)    interagency coordination and procurement support; and&#13;
(f)    sectoral training facilitation.&#13;
4.3    To enable HUEPO to undertake this work effectively, it has been strengthened,&#13;
and the personnel skill mix adjusted to reflect the needs of the implementation and&#13;
construction phase of the project. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from&#13;
HIPG that HUEPO and the participating municipalities' project offices would be&#13;
maintained throughout implementation with functions and responsibilities satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank/IlDA, with competent staff in adequate numbers.&#13;
B. IMPLEMENTATION RESPONSIBILITIES&#13;
4.4    The institutions designated by HPG and its municipal govermtents to implement,&#13;
and finance, the various components of the project, are listed in Table 4. 1, below.&#13;

4.5    Provincial and Municipal Institutions. HPG is headed by a govemor assisted by&#13;
seven vice-govemors, each of whom  oversees several commissions and/or departments.&#13;
Various provincial commissions, departments and bureaus provide supervision and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
guidance to the municipalities on matters relating to infrastructure, planning, development&#13;
and operation, including environmental protection works. Organization charts of the HPG&#13;
and the interrelationship of the project implementing agencies with the provincial&#13;
government are given in Annex 1O.&#13;
4.6    The organization of the municipal governments of Huangshi, Wuhan, Xiangfan and&#13;
Yichang is similar. Municipal affairs are overseen by the municipal economic and planning&#13;
commissions, and municipal urban and rural construction commissions.  The latter&#13;
commissions supervise a number of bureaus which are responsible for the physical&#13;
planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance of urban infrastructure, and for&#13;
environmental protection. In addition, several bureaus concerned with urban infrastructure&#13;
report directly to the office of the mayor. These include the Finance Bureau, the Water&#13;
Conservancy Bureau, the Bureau of Public Health and Public Security Bureau.&#13;
4.7    As part of China's and Hubei's policy of reforms in the public utilities sector, the&#13;
participating municipalities have established self-accounting, and self-funding state-owned&#13;
entities to implement the wastewater components of the project. Prior to negotiations, the&#13;
Bank/lIDA received (a) conformed copies of the charters, and (b) business licenses of these&#13;
agencies. The wastes management component is to be implemented, operated and&#13;
maintained by the municipalities' Sanitation Departments/Divisions.&#13;
4.8    Wastewater. Until the creation of wastewater entities, wastewater collection,&#13;
treatment and disposal were generally provided by the sewerage sections of municipal&#13;
facilities management divisions (MFMDs) of the municipal governments. These divisions&#13;
reported to the municipal urban construction bureaus (UCBs), which, in turn, came under&#13;
the authority of the municipal construction commissions. MFMDs are also responsible for&#13;
the operation and maintenance of roads, bridges, parks and street lighting. The sewerage&#13;
sections did not operate on a financially autonomous basis, transferring, instead, all tariff&#13;
revenue collections to the UCB. Funds were consolidated at the UCB level and allocated to&#13;
the various sections for operation, maintenance and capital works, on the basis of budgets&#13;
prepared and submitted by the sections. The wastewater entities created for the project will&#13;
account for their own capital and operating costs, and existing wastewater assets are being&#13;
transferred to the entities' books. While the new entities are still required to remit their&#13;
revenues to their respective municipal governments, such funds are earmarked to finance&#13;
the operation and maintenance of the sewerage facilities, and service debt. The remitted&#13;
revenues, therefore, are returned in their entirety to the entities. While less desired than full&#13;
autonomy, water companies function efficiently under such a svstem. Staff from the&#13;
existing sewerage sections in the three project cities were transferred to the newly-formned&#13;
wastewater entities and have the skills needed to maintain and operate those entities, %% ith&#13;
training provided under the project.&#13;
4.9    Wastes Management. Domestic and municipal solid waste and nightsoil collection&#13;
and disposal are the responsibility of the municipal sanitation departments. Domestic waste&#13;
and nightsoil collections are usually performed by subdistrict teams who collect the waste&#13;
from the residential units and transfer it, usually by handcart, to transfer stations around the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
cities. From there it is collected by the sanitation departments and disposed of at landfills or&#13;
dumping grounds, or, in the case of nightsoil, to storage tanks, into the sewerage system, or&#13;
to farmers. Neighborhood committees collect fees to offset collection costs.  Other&#13;
domestic costs are covered by a flat tax per employee and through general government&#13;
revenues. Industrial (including hazardous/toxic) and commercial wastes are disposed of by&#13;
the enterprises themselves, or by the sanitation departments, against payment of fees or&#13;
service charges.  Infectious hospital waste is normally incinerated by the hospitals&#13;
themselves; the domestic hospital waste is disposed of in the same manner as other&#13;
domestic waste. Recycling is practiced widely in all the project cities. The recyclables are&#13;
mainly ferrous and nonferrous metals, rubber, plastic, glass, paper and textiles. The&#13;
recyclables are usually brought to municipal-run collection points by the waste producers&#13;
themselves or by informal-sector operators. The latter collect material from producers,&#13;
from collection points, transfer stations or the disposal sites. Some of the recyclables&#13;
collected by the informal sector are sold directly to enterprises.&#13;
4.10  Industrial Pollution Control Line-of-Credit. The People's Construction Bank of&#13;
China, Hubei Branch, acting as agent for Hubei Provincial Finance Bureau, will be&#13;
responsible for appraising specific subprojects to be financed under the line of credit.&#13;
PCBC was appraised by the Bank/IDA and found to have the staff and administrative&#13;
capacity to undertake satisfactorily the agent role. A list of seven first-priority, and three&#13;
second-priority subprojects were selected by the Hubei Provincial Planning Commission,&#13;
(HPPC), working with HEPB and other regulatory agencies. Two of these subprojects&#13;
(Ezhou Iron &amp; Steel and Yichang Cement) have been appraised jointly by PCBC and the&#13;
Bank/IDA to assess the appraisal process and criteria to be used.&#13;
4.11  Preparation work on the remaining subprojects will be carried out by the individual&#13;
enterprises. PCBC will conduct the financial and technical appraisal for the prepared&#13;
subprojects.   Subproject appraisal documentation will also include environmental&#13;
assessments and resettlement action plans prepared in conformity with Bank guidelines.&#13;
PCBC will report appraisal findings to HFB, which will confirm final approval of the&#13;
subproject with HPPC. The appraisal reports for these subprojects will then be sent to the&#13;
Bank/IDA by HPPC, through HUEPO, for approval before a subloan is approved. In&#13;
addition, PCBC will administer the disbursement and collection of funds for the&#13;
subprojects, review the contract packages, and determine the methods of procurement&#13;
required. In this capacity, PCBC will bear no financial risks. Assurances were obtained&#13;
dcuring negotiations that procedures and criteria for subproject appraisal, satisfactory to&#13;
the BanklIDA, would be followed. The project files contain the appraisal criteria which&#13;
have been agreed upon with HP. The signing of a financial agency agreement, satisfactory&#13;
to the Bank/IDA, between HP and a bank, including the relevant procedures and for the&#13;
provision of the necessary services, would he a condition of disbursement for this&#13;
subcomponent (para. 3.22).&#13;
4.12   Environmental Pollution Control Fund. The Hubei Environmental Pollution&#13;
Control Fund will be operated as a part of HEPB, although with segregated accounting and&#13;
special operating procedures.  The management and operation of the HEPCF are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
summarized in Annex 12. The purpose of the HEPCF will be to provide funds for&#13;
environmental pollution control, targeted to small-scale enterprises.  Project selection&#13;
criteria have been proposed and generally follow that of similar funds in operation&#13;
elsewhere in China. Projects will be selected according to cost effectiveness and finaic;ia,&#13;
viability, with the first three appraisals and all appraisals for proposed subloans of over&#13;
$300,000 receiving ex-ante review by the Bank and the remainder subject to ex-post review.&#13;
Appraisal criteria, both technical and financial, and environmental and resettlement&#13;
requirements parallel those used in the Industrial Pollution Control Line-of-Credit described&#13;
in the previous paragraph. The principal funding sources for HEPCF will be fees levied on&#13;
pollution discharges (para. 3. 10), the proceeds of the Loan/Credit and recycling of loan and&#13;
interest payments. The approval by the Bank/IDA of an operational manual governing&#13;
HEPCF subloan processing and approval, and the execution of an acceptable financial&#13;
agency agreement between HP and a bank for subloan processing, would he conditions of&#13;
disbursement (para. 3.22).&#13;
4.13 Water Quality Monitoring and Management: Hubei Environmental&#13;
Monitoring Center (HEMC). HEMC, which was established in 1975, reports to the&#13;
Hubei Environmental Protection Bureau (HEPB). HEMC does not carry out routine&#13;
monitoring, but rather is responsible for supervising the work of municipal (Level 3) and&#13;
county (Level 4) monitoring centers in Hubei Province. These centers collect and analyze&#13;
the regular environmental monitoring samples from river cross-sections and lake sampling&#13;
points. The results are sent to HEMC where they are collated and analyzed to provide&#13;
provincial environmental quality reports. HEMC's major functions are: (a) technical&#13;
direction and training of Level 3 and 4 monitoring centers; (b) establishment and&#13;
coordination of the provincial environmental monitoring network; (c) environmental&#13;
pollution investigations; (d) data management and analyses; (e) development of&#13;
environmental quality standards; (f) development and validation of new test protocols;&#13;
(g) certification of Level 3 monitoring centers; (h) major environmental impact&#13;
assessments; (i) complex analyses which cannot be performed by municipal and COullt)&#13;
centers; and (j) research and development.&#13;
4.14  HEMC is headed by a director and has a staff of about 120, including some 80 well-&#13;
qualified technical staff. Its organizational structure includes 18 departments, of which 14&#13;
are technical and the balance administrative.&#13;
4.15 Water Quality Monitoring and Management: Wuhan Environmental&#13;
Monitoring Center (WEMC). WEMC, which was established in 1979 as a Level 3&#13;
(municipal) monitoring center, is one of the main divisions of the Wuhan Environmental&#13;
Protection Bureau, and reports to that Bureau. WEMC is responsible for monitoring&#13;
(a) water quality, (b) air quality, and (c) solid wastes. In addition to carrying out its own&#13;
analyses, WEMC oversees and compiles data from 13 Level 4 monitoring centers within&#13;
Wuhan Municipality. It produces reports for the national and provincial monitoring centers&#13;
which document industrial wastewater, surface water quality and statistical aialyses of&#13;
sampling results.  WEMC has also been given responsibility for a WorlJ  I lealtli&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
Organization Global Environmental Monitoring Station on the Yangtze River, upstream of&#13;
the Han River.&#13;
4.16   WEMC is headed by a director and has a staff of 140, including some 135 well-&#13;
qualified  technical staff.  Its organizational structure includes  13 departments,&#13;
encompassing the following four analytical functions: (a) water quality monitoring; (b) air&#13;
quality monitoring; (c) biotic monitoring; and (d) physical testing.&#13;
4.17  Institutional Development and Training. As the wastewater entities have been&#13;
created only recently and the solid waste bureaus lack financial management tools, the&#13;
project institutional development and training component has been designed specifically to&#13;
address the accounting, management information, financial management, utility pricing,&#13;
technical requirements and training needs of the entities, in particular, through activities&#13;
supported by Packages A and B (see Annex 2). Prior to negotiations HPG provided a&#13;
signed contract, acceptable to the Bank/IDA, for the provision of construction management&#13;
and operational training consulting services under Package B (para. 3.17). HPG expects to&#13;
sign a contract for the provision of financial consulting services under Package A by&#13;
effectiveness of the Loan and Credit.&#13;
C. STATUS OF ENGINEERING&#13;
4.18  Xiangfan identified an alternative landfill site late in the project preparation cycle.&#13;
To test this alternative, the Xiangfan Municipal Government intends to complete, not&#13;
later  than  December  31,  1996, (a) a  feasibility  study;  (b) detailed  design;&#13;
(c) environmental assessment; and (d) land acquisition and resettlement plan (para. 3.22).&#13;
4.19   Project preparation and design work has been undertaken jointly by international&#13;
and local consultants and design bureaus, and is well advanced. Work on final design&#13;
and draft bidding document for (a) the landfill operating equipment and solid waste&#13;
vehicles for Wuhan, Yichang and Huangshi; (b) Wuhan: Shahu/Erlangmiao/Longwangzui&#13;
civil works and equipment supply and installation; (c) Xiangfan: Fancheng interceptors&#13;
civil works; and (d) Yichang: Huangjiawan sanitary landfill, representing approximately&#13;
20 percent of municipal component investments was completed in June 1995. The&#13;
remaining final design and bidding document preparation work will continue during the&#13;
period prior to effectiveness.&#13;

5. FINANCE&#13;
A. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
5.1   Since 1978, Chinese economic reforms have evolved gradually toward an&#13;
increasingly decentralized financial system. Most industrial production and prices have&#13;
become free of government control, and enterprises have to purchase most of their inputs&#13;
at market prices. Enterprise reform has become a high priority of the Government. In&#13;
this connection, the guiding principles of the recently promulgated "regulations on&#13;
transforming the management mechanisms of state-owned industrial enterprises" are to&#13;
separate government administration from enterprise management, increase the autonomy&#13;
and accountability of state-owned enterprises, and increase competition and market&#13;
orientation. The reformn efforts to improve economic policies and enterprise efficiencies&#13;
are essential for sustaining both economic development and environmental protection in&#13;
the longer run.&#13;
5.2   In order for the enterprises to assume their increased responsibilities efficiently and&#13;
effectively, strengthening their financial management is essential. Toward this end, the&#13;
proposed project would support the application of modem management techniques and&#13;
human resource development for the utility companies.&#13;
B. ACCOUNTING&#13;
5.3   Different accounting systems are used by enterprises (autonomous units),&#13;
construction units (which execute investment projects) and local government&#13;
departments, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
5.4   Enterprise Accounting. All the state-owned enterprises in China follow a unified&#13;
enterprise accounting system. The accounting framework was developed in the context of a&#13;
highly centralized planned economy. With a view to complementing the ongoing efforts to&#13;
deepen reforms in the financial sector and enterprise management, the accounting system in&#13;
China needed modernization to permit satisfactory financial management in an increasingly&#13;
decentralized and market-oriented environment. As a first step, the general principles of&#13;
enterprise (the term to include public utilities such as water, sewerage, and district heating&#13;
companies) accounting were revised by the Ministry of Finance from July 1, 1993 to be&#13;
more consistent with internationally generally accepted accounting practice. As part of the&#13;
reforms, enterprises are required to produce five reports for submission to (Governrmeii:&#13;
balance sheet, income statement, source and application of funds, profit distribution, and&#13;
details of main business. The first two reports are required monthly, the remainder on an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
annual basis.  All enterprise implementing agencies included in the project will be&#13;
following the new accounting and reporting formats.&#13;
5.5    Government Accounting. The regular government department accounts reflect&#13;
expenditures incurred against budget allocations by HPG or their municipal government.&#13;
Accounting is handled in a decentralized manner through transfers to subunits from which&#13;
actual expenditures are made and recorded on a cash basis. Accounts are kept at all levels,&#13;
and each subunit reflects in its accounts the budget allocation it receives from the unit&#13;
above.&#13;
5.6   Project Accounts. Project accounts would be maintained by HUEPO and the&#13;
environmental sanitation divisions of Huangshi, Wuhan, Xiangfan and Yichang in&#13;
accordance with the State Construction Unit Accounting System. This system prescribes&#13;
generally accepted accounting practices, including double entry bookkeeping, subsidiary&#13;
ledger accounting, and rules for capitalizing and expensing various items of expenditure. It&#13;
also sets out detailed accounting definitions for capital works, cash control, receivables and&#13;
payables. In addition, it identifies a number of basic monthly, quarterly and annual&#13;
reporting fornats, including funds flow statements and balance sheets. The construction&#13;
accounting system is comprehensive, and is adequate for the proposed project. Project-&#13;
related expenditures incurred by enterprises (e.g., the wastewater entities and the industries&#13;
to be included in the industrial pollution control component), would be reflected within&#13;
their respective enterprise accounting systems.&#13;
C. AUDITS&#13;
5.7    As with other IBRD-financed projects in China, the Foreign Investment Audit&#13;
Bureau of the State Audit Administration (SAA), established in 1983, would have overall&#13;
responsibility for auditing accounts concerning the project. The actual auditing work will&#13;
be conducted by the Hubei Provincial Audit Department under SAA's supervision. This&#13;
arrangement is satisfactory. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the&#13;
following annual audits would be submitted to the BanklIDA within six months after the end&#13;
of the financial year: (a) audit of the project accounts maintained by HUEPO and the&#13;
environmental sanitation divisions of Huangshi, Wuhan, Xiangfan and Yichang; (h) audit of&#13;
the Special Account; (c) audit of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs); (d) audits of the&#13;
financial statements of the wastewater entities of Huangshi, Wuhan and Xiangfan, and&#13;
(e) audit of HEPCF. The Bank/lIDA would expect to receive the first such audit reports by&#13;
June 30, 1997, covering project implementation activities commencing in fiscal year 1996.&#13;
D. PROVINCIAL FINANCE&#13;
5.8   The Hubei Provincial Government has two types of finance, on-budgetary and off-&#13;
budgetary. On-budgetary revenues are provided through taxes, the base and rate of which&#13;
are set by the Central Government. The central government directly controls the single&#13;
largest tax source-the value-added tax-receipts from which are shared with local&#13;
government. A variety of other taxes are collected and used directly by local government.&#13;
Most off-budgetary revenues consist of special fees paid by enterprises, and fees and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
charges relating to construction activities. These are used for capital expenditures. On-&#13;
budgetary and off-budgetary accounts are not consolidated. While information on off-&#13;
budgetary revenues and expenditures is confidential, and was not, therefore, provided to the&#13;
Bank/IDA, they are said to be at least as large as the on-budgetary data.&#13;
5.9   HP will recover the debt associated with the project as it is being passed on to the&#13;
municipalities and industrial enterprises. HPG will monitor municipal finances to assure&#13;
that the municipalities and their respective agencies meet their debt service obligations.&#13;
Should the municipalities and their subborrowers be unable to fulfill their obligations, HP&#13;
would have no difficulty in covering debt service through its own resources, as the debt&#13;
service represented by the project is small compared to total provincial budgetary&#13;
expenditures. Provincial fiscal budgetary revenues and expenditures totaled about Y 13.1&#13;
billion ($1.6 billion) and Y 10.9 billion ($1.3 billion), respectively, in 1994. Between&#13;
1991 and 1994, revenues and expenditures increased on average by about 11 and&#13;
3 percent a year, respectively. Revenues are derived mainly from taxes on industry and&#13;
commerce, which have been remitted by the municipalities. Revenues and expenditures&#13;
are projected to grow at about 5 percent a year in real terms during the project period.&#13;
E. MUNICIPAL FINANCE&#13;
5.10 HP will, through the municipalities of Huangshi, Wuhan, Xiangfan and Yichang,&#13;
provide all funding not met by (a) the proceeds of the Bank Loan and IDA Credit, and&#13;
(b) funds generated  internally  by  the  implementing  agencies.   During  project&#13;
implementation, the financial projections show that these requirements would be of the&#13;
order of Y 109 million for Huangshi, Y 923 million for Wuhan, Y 338 million for&#13;
Xiangfan, and Y 62 million for Yichang. The municipalities, like HPG, have two sources&#13;
of finance, on-budget and off-budget. The off-budget details are confidential, and were not,&#13;
therefore, provided to the Bank/IDA. The municipal funding requirements would come&#13;
from many more sources than municipal on-budget revenue. The Hubei Finance Bureau&#13;
(HFB) has independently assessed the municipalities' abilitv to generate the required&#13;
counterpart funds from assured sources.&#13;
5.11   Average annual project-related expenditures comprise between about I to 4 percent&#13;
of the municipalities' annual total on-budget expenditures, and between 20 and 40 percent&#13;
of their annual capital expenditures, except for Xiangfan where the planned expenditures&#13;
were substantially curtailed due to counterpart funding constraints, but still temporarily&#13;
represent about a twofold increase in capital expenditures. During negotiations, assurancc..&#13;
were obtained from HPG that it would provide, directly or through the municipalitie.s, the&#13;
necessary counterpartfunds for the execution of the project.&#13;
F. WASTEWATER AGENCIES&#13;
5.12  As the wastewater agencies, which evolved out of the cities' departmental&#13;
wastewater operations, were established only in the latter phases of the project&#13;
preparation cycle, no assessment of their past performance was possible. Based on the&#13;
limited data available, it was determined that the Huangshi and Xiangfan departmental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
wastewater operations were able to meet their operating expenses, excluding&#13;
depreciation, in 1994. As is the practice in departmental operations, no provision for&#13;
depreciation was made. Had depreciation charges been included, their operations would&#13;
have run at a loss. In Huangshi, the revenue from wastewater operations in 1994 was&#13;
calculated to be Y 3.5 million, based on 1993 drainage fee collections of Y 1.9 million&#13;
plus industrial discharge fee collections of Y 1.2 million, adjusted to reflect some&#13;
inflation. In Xiangfan, no operating revenues were assumed. Instead, an amount of Y 4.7&#13;
million was assumed as nonoperating revenue, representing discharge fees paid to&#13;
Xiangfan EPB. As no departmental revenue data were made available from Wuhan, the&#13;
financial projections were developed from the net historical value of investments made in&#13;
the wastewater sector. The financial objective set by HPG for the newly-established&#13;
wastewater companies is to achieve full cost recovery, and, if possible, generate some&#13;
funds for future capital investment.&#13;
Wastewater Treatment&#13;
5.13   Prior to negotiations, the Bank/IDA received written confirmation from HPG that it&#13;
had authorized the wastewater agencies of Huangshi, Wuhan and Xiangfan to implement&#13;
enhanced wastewater tariffs from January 1, 1996, such enhanced tariffs to be applicable to&#13;
all residerntial and nonresidential wastewater producers within the respective service areas of&#13;
the project wastewater agencies. The existing and initial revised average tariffs are set out&#13;
in Table 5.1 below. HPG confirned also that it had authorized the wastewater agencies to&#13;
increase their average wastewater tariffs by Y 0.02/M3 a year from 1997 to 2001. These&#13;
tariff levels should be sufficient to meet the financial covenants (para. 5.15) to at least the&#13;
year 2000 in the case of Huangshi and Xiangfan, and 2002 in the case of Wuhan. The&#13;
salient features of the projected finances of: (a) Huangshi Municipal Drainage Companv&#13;
(HMDC); (b) Wuhan Municipal Wastewater Enterprise (WMWE); and (c) Xiangfan&#13;
Municipal Sewerage Company (XMSC), are highlighted in Table 5.2 below. The&#13;
assumptions used in the financial projections and projected financial statements and detailed&#13;
monitoring indicators are included in Annex 13.&#13;
Table 5.1: WASTEWATER AVERAGE TARIFFS&#13;

5.14  Tariffs would be set at levels which would provide a contribution to capital&#13;
expenditures as well as cover operation and maintenance costs. The financial projections,&#13;
which are summarized below (Table 5.2) take this into account. Over the implementation&#13;
period of the project the wastewater entities are projected to make the following&#13;
contributions to their respective project investments: Huangshi-38 percent; Wuhan-&#13;
31 percent; and Xiangfan-13 percent, notwithstanding a more limited minimum financial&#13;
objective, as indicated in the following paragraph.&#13;
5.15  Assurances were obtained during negotiations that, commencing with Fiscal Year&#13;
1996, HPG would cause the wastewater entities of Huangshi, Wuhan and Xiangfan to&#13;
(a) produce revenues from their wastewater operations sufficient to cover their operations&#13;
and maintenance costs (including depreciation), and the amount by which debt service&#13;
requirements exceed the provision for depreciation; and (b) incur no additional debt&#13;
without the BanklIDA's agreement, unless a reasonable forecast shows that the entities&#13;
would have a debt service coverage of at least 1.3 times.&#13;
5.16  Implementation of a wastewater tariff of Y 0. 18/m3 applicable to all residential and&#13;
nonresidential wastewater producers within the service areas of HMDC, WAMWE and&#13;
XMSC is a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
5.17  Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the wastewater companies&#13;
would prepare, before September 30, 1996, and in each of the following fiscal years,&#13;
forecasts satisfactory to the Bank/IDA, (a) to review whether they would meet the&#13;
covenanted requirements set forth above in such year and the following fiscal year; and&#13;
(b) to furnish the results of such reviews to the Bank/IDA. If any such review would show&#13;
that the wastewater company would not meet the requirements set out above, the company&#13;
would take all necessary measures, including adjustments to the structure of its tariffs and&#13;
charges, in order to meet the requirements.&#13;

G. WASTES MANAGEMENT&#13;
5.18   Solid waste and nightsoil management services are general municipal services&#13;
which have traditionally been funded from the general revenues of local governments.&#13;
However, where individual users of the services have been identified, local governments&#13;
have, as a policy matter, charged such users for the services provided. Thus, commercial&#13;
and industrial entities which haul their refuse to landfill for disposal, or contract with&#13;
their respective sanitation departments to do so, have been charged a disposal fee.&#13;
5.19   The 1993 recurrent cost recovery ratios for solid waste management in the project&#13;
cities were as follows: Huangshi-43 percent; Wuhan-4 1 percent; Xiangfan-26 percent;&#13;
and Yichang -35 percent. Huangshi and Wuhan have shown a steadily improving&#13;
performance over the period 1990-93; Xiangfan's performance over the same period has&#13;
been static.  Yichang commenced charging for its service only in 1992 when its cost&#13;
recovery ratio was 40 percent. The 1993 cost recovery ratios for nightsoil among the cities&#13;
varied from 8 percent to 20 percent.&#13;
5.20   All four project cities have considered increasing their fees and charges, and in two&#13;
of the cities the appropriate authorities have already approved higher charges for some parts&#13;
of the services. The cost recovery objective for solid waste and nightsoil services for all&#13;
four cities is to recover the full unit cost of collection and disposal where user identification&#13;
and billing is economically feasible. The balance of the cost for providing these services&#13;
would be met from the general revenues of the municipality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
5.21   During the implementation phase of this component the cities have indicated that&#13;
they intend to apply a portion of the proceeds of their respective solid waste and nightsoil&#13;
user charges and fees towards meeting their counterpart funding requirements. During&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtained from HPG that it would ensure that Huangshi,&#13;
Wuhan, Xiangfan, and Yichang Municipalities would each: (a) not later than April 1,&#13;
1997, complete a study of the fees and user charges needed for the recovery of the full&#13;
costs of providing solid waste collection and disposal services to industrial and&#13;
commercial users; the report of that study shall include a detailed, time-bound action&#13;
plan, acceptable to the Bank, enabling such recovery as of July 1, 1997; and&#13;
(b) thereafter implement the said action plan taking into account the Bank/IDA's&#13;
comments thereon.&#13;
5.22   As these services have been decentralized to the district and subdistrict levels, and&#13;
because the accounting systems, particularly at the lower levels, are weak, accurate costs of&#13;
providing these services have been difficult to determine. The project, therefore, includes&#13;
technical assistance and training to help develop appropriate accounting, including unit cost&#13;
accounting, and management information systems for determining accurate unit costs of the&#13;
services at the various stages, e.g., collection, transportation, treatment (in the case of&#13;
nightsoil), and final disposal. With such information, the cities would then be in a better&#13;
position tu (a) assess the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the services; (b) price their&#13;
services to recover the full economic cost where user identification and billing is&#13;
economically feasible; and (c) judge whether the services, or parts thereof, can be further&#13;
commercialized or privatized.&#13;
I}. INDUSTRIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION CONTROL SUBPROJECTS&#13;
5.23   As some of the priority pollution control subprojects are, by nature, not&#13;
financially productive, the financial appraisal would focus on the long-term financial&#13;
health of the enterprises.  The key considerations in this assessment include the&#13;
enterprise's development goals and strategy, product mix and market analysis, investment&#13;
requirements and related financing arrangements, and projected financial performance in&#13;
terms of profitability, liquidity and debt servicing capabilities.  The two industrial&#13;
pollution control subprojects that Bank/IDA staff have already appraised meet the above&#13;
financial criteria and therefore are considered financially viable.  With a view to&#13;
promoting prudent financial management, the agreed subproject selection criteria call for&#13;
the entity to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.4 times after the&#13;
proposed subproject has reached full production capacity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

6. ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL&#13;
CONSIDERATIONS&#13;
A. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
6.1   As described in Chapter 2, the project derives from the CAS in its support of&#13;
provincial efforts to substantially reduce pollution within the province, especially within&#13;
densely populated urban areas, by improving environmental regulation and providing new&#13;
models for the efficient organization and financing of urban environmental services.&#13;
Specifically, the project would support:&#13;
(a)   the more aggressive use of user fees to shift the burden of pollution&#13;
abatement to the polluter and induce waste minimization, and new&#13;
organizational forms for wastewater providers, to allow improved&#13;
management tools and to help minimize the cost of abatement;&#13;
(b)   the provincial and municipal EPBs in their efforts to implement more&#13;
effective regulatory instruments;&#13;
(c)   expansion of sewerage services, hence a reduction in water pollution, within&#13;
the boundaries of Wuhan, Xiangfan, and Huangshi, thus protecting the&#13;
urban environment and the health of their people;&#13;
(d)   the first municipal solid waste landfills meeting national standards in the&#13;
cities of Xiangfan and Yichang, and major capacity expansion in Huangshi&#13;
and Wuhan, with consequent protection of local land and water resources&#13;
and flaring of landfill methane to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and&#13;
(e)   a line of credit to allow abatement of important industrial point sources of&#13;
pollution affecting large urban populations and a pollution control revolving&#13;
fund to provide a model for such funds.&#13;
B. ECONoMic ANALYSIS&#13;
6.2   Current methodologies do not permit high-confidence benefit estimates for the&#13;
major municipal investments in wastewater and solid waste collection and treatment&#13;
proposed under this project. Although some benefits, such as restoring Wuhan's East&#13;
Lake as a source of potable water, can be readily quantified, measurement becomes&#13;
exceedingly problematic for the complex of aesthetic, health, agricultural, and other&#13;
impacts that often reach far beyond the political boundaries of the polluter. For this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
reason, project formulation did not utilize traditional benefit-cost analysis as the basis for&#13;
allocating resources.&#13;
6.3    During project identification, it became clear that Hubei and its cities needed&#13;
substantial change in policy and institutional structures along the lines described in the&#13;
sector work reported in Chapter 1 (China: Urban Environmental Service Management).&#13;
Policy problems included urban environmental services priced too low to discourage&#13;
waste generation or provide the financing needed to build, maintain, and operate services&#13;
such as wastewater collection and treatment. Government bureaus providing the services&#13;
lacked the financial tools to develop effective tariff strategies or the operating autonomy&#13;
needed to encourage managerial innovation. Gaps in environmental regulation were also&#13;
apparent. Therefore, investment choices were made with a view toward maximizing the&#13;
impact of policy and institutional innovation within the province. Specific investment&#13;
choices within sectors and cities responded to long-run municipal government strategies&#13;
to bring ambient environmental quality or service standards up to national guidelines and&#13;
were evaluated on a least-cost option basis. The analysis is discussed in more detail in&#13;
Annex 14 and the detailed calculations can be found in the project files. Highlights of the&#13;
analysis are given below.&#13;
6.4    City and Sector Choices. In urban environmental service provision, cities were&#13;
included in the project based on the size of the population potentially benefiting from&#13;
improved services and considering their value as models to other provincial cities. After&#13;
reviewing potential investments in some nine provincial cities, the four largest cities were&#13;
selected for further project development.  Each of those cities had already prepared&#13;
environmental improvement plans that outlined priority service improvements, both in&#13;
terms of the type of service and areas of the city needing service. Work with Bank missions&#13;
confirmed the choice to extend sewerage systems and build or substantially expand sanitary&#13;
landfills as the next step in environmental protection.&#13;
6.5    Credit market constraints (described much more fully in the China Department's&#13;
1995 Capital Markets Sector Study (No. 14501-CHA)) leave unexploited a large number of&#13;
abatement opportunities in economically and financially viable enterprises that currently&#13;
have a high pollution impact on large populations. Hubei Province therefore sought to use&#13;
part of the loan to fund such investments. The Province agreed with the Bank on a selection&#13;
process to identify the highest-impact polluters and provide them access to a line-of-credit&#13;
to finance abatement interventions.&#13;
6.6    Given that urban environmental problems could be successfully addressed only by a&#13;
combination of urban service and industrial pollution control measures, and that the high&#13;
visibility of Bank-financed operations was thought important to providing model&#13;
approaches to outstanding problems, HPG and the Bank/IDA agreed that both types of&#13;
activities should be incorporated into the loan and credit. The allocation of the loan and&#13;
credit between the two types of activities, approximately two thirds to municipal services&#13;
and one third to industrial and environmental pollution control, resulted from a shared&#13;
judgment about the balance that would produce maximum impact within the province.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
6.7    Wastewater.  Wastewater collection and treatment programs are discussed in&#13;
detail in Annex 14. In no city were counterpart funds sufficient to finance completion of&#13;
wastewater collection systems. Therefore, the engineering and economic analysis sought&#13;
to identify the largest wastewater loads that could be picked up with availablc funds-a&#13;
variation on the least-cost approach. For Xiangfan, whose water pollution affects urban&#13;
tributaries to the Han River, and that river itself, only one of the two major urban districts&#13;
could be sewered. Of the two, Fancheng district could be handled at lower cost and was&#13;
therefore selected (Map 27175). The interceptor sewer will pick up most discharges to&#13;
the Xiaoqinghe and Qilihe Rivers, the largest within Fancheng, with a resulting quality&#13;
increase from below usable standard to Class III, which permits agricultural and&#13;
industrial use.2 The wastewater will discharge through a preliminary treatment plant to&#13;
the Han River, where a net improvement in water quality must await later primary and&#13;
secondary treatment. For Huangshi, on the Yangtze (Map 27175), the largest problem is&#13;
Cihu lake, major parts of which have deteriorated from Class III to worse than Class V in&#13;
a decade. Of the planned northern and southern trunk sewers around Cihu, the southern&#13;
would serve the largest sources of Cihu pollution and 120,000 people. This investment&#13;
alone is estimated to bring the lake back to Class III standard. Modeling showed that the&#13;
additional discharges to the Yangtze could be safely assimilated. Wuhan had lost the use&#13;
of 10 percent of municipal water supply previously extracted from East Lake, which has&#13;
fallen to Class IV in many areas. The cost of that loss had been an average of Y 20&#13;
million per year in replacement supply from the Yangtze. The chosen intervention of&#13;
diversion plus primary treatment will cost Y 640 million and restore East Lake quality to&#13;
Class IlI.&#13;
6.8    Solid Waste. Solid waste landfills are also discussed in detail in Annex 14. Here,&#13;
initial choices were among potential solid waste disposal strategies that included recycling,&#13;
composting, incineration, and landfilling. Recycling plays an active role in each of the&#13;
cities, captunrng most of the 5 percent of the municipal waste stream that can be profitably&#13;
recycled. The industry is highly competitive, with little scope for additional useful&#13;
municipal intervention. Composting, to recycle organic materials, has been tested with&#13;
scant success in Wuhan and other Chinese cities. Costs have been high and markets have&#13;
not supported product sales. A major problem for composting and incineration is that over&#13;
half of the waste stream is inorganic, with coal ash the dominant inorganic component.&#13;
Analysis in other cities with similar waste streams has shown incineration to be&#13;
substantially more costly than landfill. Based on that work, each of the four cities has&#13;
elected to use landfilling to handle their municipal solid wastes.&#13;
6.9    The cities have accepted that such landfills must comply with national standards, so&#13;
made no attempt to compare the cost of adding leachate and gas collection with the damage&#13;
that would ensue from their absence. Given the long run risks inherent in unprotected&#13;
2 The water quality classification system: Classes I and II: high quality suitable for drinking water&#13;
source; Class Ill: usable for drinking water after treatment; Class IV: boating, fishing, industrial water&#13;
supply; Class V: irrigation and industrial cooling.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
landfills, the Bank accepted without additional impact evaluation the municipal judgment&#13;
on the need to provide leachate and gas collection and treatment. The least cost site and&#13;
design had, as one of the main decision criteria, minimization of the joint cost of transport&#13;
and land acquisition. As land acquisition cost correlates very strongly with resettlement&#13;
impact, this criteria also tends to minimize resettlement. For Wuhan, the availability of&#13;
suitable land adjoining an existing landfill determined the site choice.  Xiangfan is&#13;
continuing analysis of two alternative sites, while Yichang and Huangshi have both&#13;
confirmed sites among their alternatives.&#13;
6.10  Industrial Pollution Control. The industrial pollution control component has two&#13;
subcomponents, one a line of credit for major investments and the other a pollution control&#13;
fund targeting small investments and small-scale enterprises.  Eligibility criteria were&#13;
discussed in para. 2.9 and, second to the environmental impact ranking, require a&#13;
financially and economically viable enterprise. Once that is demonstrated, proposed&#13;
abatement measures would be appraised for technical feasibility and economic least cost.&#13;
Given the difficulty of valuing environmental externalities, an economic rate of return&#13;
would not normnally be calculated. This approach recognizes that the most efficient&#13;
pollution abatement investments will not necessarily produce a positive financial or easily&#13;
valued economic return and therefore focuses on the fundamental soundness of the&#13;
enterprise. The firm ranked most damaging among the viable firms was Ezhou Iron and&#13;
Steel Company (Egang). The firm's proposed abatement projects were jointly appraised by&#13;
Bank and PCBC staff to test the domestic appraisal process. Other line-of-credit applicants&#13;
must pass similar appraisals, all of which will be subject to Bank prior review.&#13;
6.11   The successful appraisal (see Annex 14, paras. 26-32 for fuller treatment) covered&#13;
two subcomponents at the enterprise, one for air pollution abatement and the other&#13;
wastewater treatment. The key appraisal finding showed the firm to be financially&#13;
healthy and economically viable. The firm benefited from progressive price liberalization&#13;
after 1992, and in 1994 had net profits of Y 220 million on sales of Y 1,520 million and&#13;
low debt compared to the industry average. The latter finding was particularly important&#13;
given the rapid integration of China's steel industry into the international market&#13;
economy. In terms of proposed interventions, the first Egang subcomponent will replace&#13;
a 40-year old electric arc furnace that is responsible for 23 percent of the TSP&#13;
concentrations within an urban area containing some 200,000 people. The proposed&#13;
investment is in a new furnace, incorporating up-to-date air pollution control, which will&#13;
produce virtually no particulates or oxides of nitrogen (NOJ) and will improve air quality&#13;
for affected people from Class III to Class II. The smallest economically viable furnaces&#13;
now have a capacity of about 300,000 tons/year, some 20 percent higher than the current&#13;
furnace. This capacity increase, coupled with input efficiency gains and the higher&#13;
quality output of modern furnaces, will give that subcomponent a positive financial and&#13;
economic return before accounting for the environmental benefits. The investment itself&#13;
will yield an estimated 12 percent financial and 23 percent economic rate of return, where&#13;
the economic rate of return incorporates none of the air quality gains. Most of the gap&#13;
between the financial and economic rates of return is due to the fact that Egang steel is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
priced 20 to 30 percent below CIF imported prices for equivalent products. That gap&#13;
leaves substantial room to absorb price pressures should the world steel market soften.&#13;
6.12 The analysis also looked at the sensitivity of the economic rate of returns to&#13;
various changes. The four factors judged to have the greatest impact on the economic&#13;
rate of return were changes in the economic price of steel, an increase in input costs&#13;
relative to sales prices, higher-than-anticipated capital costs, and lower-than-anticipated&#13;
efficiency levels (Annex 14, para. 29). To drop the ERR to 12 percent, a combination of&#13;
factors including a 20 percent drop in sales price (to over 40 percent below intemational&#13;
market levels), a 10 percent increase in capital costs, and a 10 percent "learning curve"&#13;
drop in efficiency would have to occur simultaneously. Note that this ERR does not&#13;
consider environmental benefits, hence understates true returns. This or similar adverse&#13;
combinations are judged highly unlikely given Egang's operating experience and recent&#13;
market history in the key input and output markets.&#13;
6.13 The high and robust economic returns to the proposed air pollution control&#13;
investment are an example of a "win-win" solution to an environmental problem.&#13;
However, Egang also includes an example of damaging wastewater discharges that are&#13;
difficult to value, and the main available intervention increases operating costs with no&#13;
corresponding increase in a marketable product. Egang discharges some 17 tons a year of&#13;
phenol, 11.8 tons of cyanide, and 462 tons of oil, as well as large amounts of solids and&#13;
chemical oxygen demand (COD) into local watercourses and then the Yangtze. The&#13;
phenol and cyanide contribute over 90 percent of all such discharges in Ezhou city and&#13;
the oil 63 percent, with the result that the major urban waterways fall to category IV for&#13;
phenol and oil, and II for cyanide.&#13;
6.14  To reduce these discharges, Egang will invest an estimated Y 130 million and&#13;
substantially revamp their wastewater handling system. All discharges currently entering&#13;
the Yanglan Lake or Xingang River will be intercepted, treated, and reused, ending&#13;
Egang's contribution to their pollution. Yanglan Lake is fished and used as an industrial&#13;
water supply source. The Xingang River provides potable water for villagers and a&#13;
source of industrial water supply. No epidemiological work has been done on the impact&#13;
of Egang discharges through fish consumption or domestic water supply, so damage&#13;
estimates were not possible. The most serious discharges, from the coking plant, will&#13;
continue to discharge directly to the Yangtze. However, a new coking wastewater&#13;
treatment plant financed by the project will radically reduce pollutants in that discharge,&#13;
with, for example, phenol falling from 1.53 tons/year to 0.45 tons/year and oil from&#13;
32.4 tons/year to 6.5 tons/year. The net effect of the investment will be to bring the&#13;
Xingang River and Yanglan Lake to Class II in these pollutants, allowing safe use of the&#13;
water.&#13;
C. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
6.15   The project would contribute significantly to improving Hubei's environment, in&#13;
ways detailed in the body of this report and its annexes. Potential adverse impacts from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
the sanitary landfill and industrial pollution control components require an "A" category&#13;
in terms of the World Bank's Operational Directive on Environmental Assessment (EA).&#13;
Accordingly, a full EA has been completed, reviewed by the Bank and approved by&#13;
NEPA. The full report can be found in the project files. Annex 7 details the EA findings&#13;
and reflects the findings of the appraisal mission. The resettlement impact of the project&#13;
will be managed through a resettlement action plan that can be found in the project files&#13;
and is summarized in Annex 6.&#13;
D. AFFORDABILITY AND POVERTY ASSESSMENT&#13;
6.16   The affordability issue arises only with the wastewater components of the&#13;
proposed project.  The industrial pollution interventions will proceed only if the&#13;
enterprise can demonstrate that it will remain financially sound after the investment, and&#13;
solid waste charges will rise only for industrial and commercial users of the new landfills.&#13;
Affordability of the new wastewater systems was tested against current consumption&#13;
patterns and average income of the poorest 10 percent of the urban population in the three&#13;
cities. The proposed first-year tariff would consume an average of 0.25 percent of the&#13;
income of the poorest 10 percent, based on 80 percent of water used. Indeed, because the&#13;
poor are less likely than other households to have water piped to the house (using&#13;
standpipes instead, for which no fees are currently charged), even the 0.25 percent figure&#13;
represents an upper bound.&#13;
6.17   The affordability of the higher tariffs anticipated in later years will clearly depend&#13;
on changes in real income among the urban poor over time. In real termns, the tariffs will&#13;
increase to as much as twice the anticipated 1996 rate. With no change in real income&#13;
and no consumption effect, the average wastewater bill would increase to 0.50 percent of&#13;
average income for the poorest 10 percent of households. However, over the past decade,&#13;
the real incomes of the urban poor have risen in line with overall income increases. If&#13;
that pattem, and overall real personal income growth, continues near current rates,&#13;
wastewater tariffs as a percentage of personal income would remain virtually unchanged&#13;
from the first-year level. In absolute terms, the increase would be fully offset by first&#13;
year income gains.&#13;
E. PROJECT Risks&#13;
6.18   The proposed project faces or mitigates a variety of risks. Those risks are here&#13;
grouped under three general headings: implementation and operational risks, regulatory&#13;
risk, and risks to long-term sustainability. Each type of risk is discussed in detail in&#13;
Annex 14. Those findings will be briefly summarized here.&#13;
6.19   Project financing presents a risk due to the need for municipal counterpart&#13;
funding. Among the four cities, Xiangfan has committed the highest percentage of its&#13;
on-budget resources to the project.  The final investment represents a substantial&#13;
reduction on Xiangfan's requested program, in an attempt to minimize the financing risk.&#13;
Additional mitigation is provided by the phasing of the Xiangfan solid waste investments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
and by independent provincial finance bureau affirmation of Bank findings on the&#13;
adequacy of counterpart funds.&#13;
6.20  The shift to new organizational forms for wastewater management is critical to&#13;
project success. Slow institutional innovation therefore becomes a project risk. All&#13;
cities are well along in the process, with Xiangfan having successfully completed the&#13;
transformation to an enterprise. In Huangshi, assets have been revalued and that work is&#13;
being reviewed by the State Asset Bureau, the last step before formal transfer. Wuhan has&#13;
begun revaluing assets and expects to undertake the transfer by the end of 1995, well before&#13;
planned effectiveness.  The groundwork is thus laid for introduction of the new&#13;
accounting and management information systems needed to efficiently guide the work of&#13;
these enterprises. In the long run, efficient operation will also depend on cities honoring&#13;
the autonomy of the enterprises in personnel and other management decisions. This&#13;
element of risk cannot be divorced from larger efforts within the economy to reform&#13;
government relations with the state owned enterprise sector. These issues have recently&#13;
received thorough analysis in State Owned Enterprise Reform (currently in yellow cover).&#13;
6.21   The industrial and environmental pollution control components create credit risk&#13;
born by the provincial government. Under the line of credit, the agent bank, for a fee,&#13;
undertakes project appraisal and handles fund administration on behalf of the provincial&#13;
goverrnment. An essential element of the project appraisal, which is subject to review and&#13;
confirmation by the provincial finance bureau, is analysis of the firm's financial strength&#13;
and the risk it faces in its input and output markets. Subloans to be made by HEPCF will&#13;
be governed by operating procedures that remain to be approved by the Bank/IDA.&#13;
HEPCF will also enter into an agreement with a bank for subloan processing. All&#13;
enterprises must meet a 1.4 debt service coverage requirement over the project life,&#13;
providing that margin of safety to the government exposure. The loans are being made at&#13;
no less than 150 basis points over the Bank variable lending rate, in US dollars, with the&#13;
enterprise bearing the foreign exchange risk. With fees to the agent bank amounting to&#13;
no more than 50 basis points, the provincial government will capture at least 100 basis&#13;
points to cover their costs and risks. In addition, they will enjoy the use of loan and&#13;
interest payments in the interval between collection from the enterprise and repayment to&#13;
the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
6.22  Operational risks arise in the industrial and environmental pollution control&#13;
components with the failure (documented in "China: Urban Environmental Services&#13;
Management") of many enterprises to operate their pollution abatement facilities. The&#13;
analysis addressed the risk that pollution abatement goals would not be met. Based on&#13;
the short-listed project designs, this risk is deemed to be very small for the reason that,&#13;
although not a requirement for access to the line-of-credit, the bulk of the proposed&#13;
investments are in process changes. The production process itself is inherently much&#13;
cleaner than the original process, leading to the pollution control gains&#13;
6.23   Major policy risks include possible resistance to timely implementation of the new&#13;
tariff structure. Failure to implement agreed tariffs would seriously impair the performance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
incentives of the utilities and their ability to finance ongoing investment programs. To&#13;
mitigate this risk, a tariff increase before negotiation is being required and tariffs will be a&#13;
supervision focal point. The latter will be aided by the fact that service providers are&#13;
required to present annual accounts showing whether existing tariffs have met their&#13;
financial needs and to project tariff levels needed in the following year.&#13;
6.24   Significant regulatory risks also arise because the pollution control results&#13;
anticipated for the surface waters depend not only on sewerage technologies successfully&#13;
constructed and operated by the cities. Many important pollutants must be controlled at&#13;
source by the industries generating them. A failure to do so could threaten either the&#13;
sewerage infrastructure or the quality of the various lakes and rivers, depending on&#13;
enterprise discharge points. The principal means of mitigating this risk is a strong&#13;
regulatory regime. The importance of this work was recognized during preparation of the&#13;
project and is addressed under the environmental action plan (Annex 11).&#13;
6.25   The major risks to long term sustainability are financial and regulatory, and have&#13;
been discussed above. Additional risks arise from outside of the cities themselves and&#13;
center on polluting inputs to the various water bodies from areas beyond municipal&#13;
control. These additional pollutants could overwhelm any benefit that would otherwise&#13;
be realized by the planned investments. In the case of the network of waterways within&#13;
the cities, this risk is not great. Most of their watersheds are small, pollutants are of local&#13;
origin, and their control will be a function of the proper operation of the project.&#13;
However, the Han and Yangtze suffer from nonpoint source pollutants, particularly&#13;
agricultural, and carry substantial nutrient loads from upstream agriculture as well as&#13;
industrial pollution discharges. Satisfactory abatement of those polluting sources will&#13;
depend on the actions of a large number of political jurisdictions, most of which would&#13;
suffer no immediate harm from continued discharges to these rivers. The growing&#13;
appreciation within China of the importance of water pollution abatement offers the best&#13;
hope of inducing compliance with the current industrial regulations.  A  similar&#13;
appreciation of the risks from agriculture has yet to appear, and must become an element&#13;
of river basin quality control.&#13;
&#13;

- 57-            ANNEX 1&#13;
ANNEX 1: BACKGROUND TO HUBEI PROVINCE AND&#13;
PROJECT CITIES&#13;
Hubei Province&#13;
I.    Hubei Province is located in Central China and is bordered clockwise from the north&#13;
by the Provinces of Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Sichuan and Shaanxi. It is traversed by&#13;
the mid-reaches of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River, the largest in the country. The&#13;
Province has a total land area of 186,000 km2 and a population of 55 million (1990), of&#13;
which about 15 million (27 percent) live in urban areas. While total population in the&#13;
Province has been growing at about 1.4 percent, nonagricultural population growth has been&#13;
about 8 percent a year since 1980. It ranks ninth among Chinese provinces and autonomous&#13;
regions in terms of population and aggregate GNP (Y 100 billion in 1992), and fourteenth&#13;
in terms of GNP per capita (Y 1,460).&#13;
2.    The topography of the Province is mountainous and hilly, except in the south. It has&#13;
a subtropical, hurnid, monsoonal climate with hot wet summers and dry winters. The&#13;
Province is prone to frequent droughts and floods. The average annual rainfall is 750 to&#13;
1.500 mm (30 to 59 inches). Although still predominately a rural province, industry&#13;
accounts for two thirds of Hubei's gross domestic output value, mainly from state-owned&#13;
enterprises that employ about two thirds of the industrial work force, mostly in heavy&#13;
industries, notably iron, steel, cement and chemicals.&#13;
luangshi&#13;
3.    Huangshi is located in the southeastem part of Hubei Province, on the south bank of&#13;
the middle reaches of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River and north of Huangjing Mountain,&#13;
and is the second largest city of the Province. Cihu, Daye and Quinshan Lakes lie in its&#13;
hinterland. There are four urban districts (Huangshigang, Shihuiyao, Xialu and Tieshan)&#13;
and one suburban county (Daye) in the city.&#13;
4.    The total municipal area is about 1,850 km2, of which the urban area is just under&#13;
10 percent. The total population is 1.35 million, of which the urban population is 510,000.&#13;
The 1-rban population density is around 3,000 persons per kmi2; the urban population is&#13;
expected to reach about 660,000 by year 2010.&#13;
5.    Historically, Huangshi was famous for its ore smelting. With the Daye steel plant,&#13;
an iron mine, a coal mine and a cement plant, it was among the pioneers of modem industry&#13;
in China. From this background, the city has developed an industrial base with a full range&#13;
of activities covering metallurgy, machinery, power generation, building materials and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -            ANNEX 1&#13;
textiles. The industrial output value was Y 3.3 billion in 1990; this is expected to reach&#13;
around Y 6.6 billion by year 2000.&#13;
6.    About 90 percent of the urban area in the vicinity of Shenyanggang Canal is served&#13;
by a piped combined wastewater and stormwater drainage system. A recently com3leted&#13;
secondary wastewater treatment plant in Huangshigang, with a capacity of 20,000 m /day,&#13;
is currently treating a mix of 70 percent industrial and 30 percent domestic wastewater. The&#13;
plant is operating at about 70 percent capacity. However, construction work is underway to&#13;
divert flows presently entering the northeast corner of Cihu Lake, to this treatment plant.&#13;
Untreated industrial effluent is currently being discharged into the southern area of Cihu&#13;
Lake, resulting in significant deterioration of the natural water quality and associated loss of&#13;
amenity to local residents. A major objective of the Huangshi Wastewater component is to&#13;
improve the water quality of Cihu Lake.&#13;
7.    The problems of solid waste and nightsoil management in Huangshi are typical of&#13;
those in Wuhan, Xiangfan and Yichang. While the primary collection systems are&#13;
effective, problems arise in the transfer, transport and disposal of the wastes. The handling&#13;
and uncontrolled disposal of wastes, often at illegal sites, pose health hazards to sanitation&#13;
department workers in particular, and to the public in general. Nightsoil is often applied&#13;
directly to fields before being allowed to digest in storage tanks. The major objectives of&#13;
the project cities' solid waste and nightsoil management components are, therefore, to&#13;
improve transfer facilities, transportation, and the ultimate disposal of wastes in an&#13;
environmentally acceptable manner.&#13;
Wuhan&#13;
8.    Wuhan is located in the east of Hubei Province in Central China and is the&#13;
Provincial capital. The Yangtze River enters the city from the southwest and the Han River&#13;
joins the Yangtze coming from the west. The two rivers divide the city into three parts:&#13;
Hankou, Wuchang and Hanyang. The city has seven urban districts (Jiangan, Jianhang,&#13;
Qiaokou, Hangyan, Wuchang, Quingshan and Hongshan), two suburban districts&#13;
(Dongxihu and Hannan) and four suburban counties (Wuchang, Huangpi, Hanyang and&#13;
Xinzhou). The area is generally flat with a large number of lakes. The highest point of the&#13;
city is Yujia Hill, 152 meters above sea level.&#13;
9.    The total municipal area is some 8,500 km2, of which the urban area is&#13;
approximately 10percent. The 1992 population of the municipality was about 6.8&#13;
million, of which the urban population was estimated to be 3.5 million. The urban&#13;
population density in the city is around 4,000 persons per km 2; the urban population is&#13;
expected to reach some 7.65 million by year 2000.&#13;
10.   Wuhan is a regional transportation center, located at the mid-point of the major&#13;
north-south rail line linking Beijing to Guangzhou. The Yangtze River is dredged to&#13;
provide a transportation route from Shanghai to Sichuan Province.&#13;

11.  In Wuhan there are some 4,500 industrial enterprises, making the city one of the&#13;
most important industrial centers in China. The main industries are iron and steel,&#13;
chemical, electronics, machinery and weaving. Wuhan Iron and Steel Works is one of the&#13;
largest in China, producing 7 million tons annually. The total industrial output was Y 22&#13;
billion in 1992, this is expected to increase tenfold by year 2010.&#13;
12.   About 60 percent of the urban area is served by a piped combined stormwater and&#13;
wastewater drainage system. Over 90 percent of the urban population is served by septic&#13;
tanks, with the effluent discharging to the combined system and open ditches. The&#13;
remaining population is served by water flush and dry pit communal public latrines.&#13;
13.   There are about 10 wastewater outfalls discharging directly into East Lake, which&#13;
is an existing source of municipal water supply. A further outfall, which accounted for&#13;
about 50 percent of the wastewater flows entering East lake, has now been diverted to the&#13;
Changjiang River.  A recently completed secondary wastewater treatment plant at&#13;
Waishahu, with a design capacity of 50,000 m3/d, was shut down a few weeks after&#13;
commissioning for lack of operating funds. One of the major objective of the Wuhan&#13;
Wastewater component is to improve the quality of the water body in East Lake.&#13;
Xiangfan&#13;
14.   Xiangfan, located in the northwestern part of Hubei Province, is a hub in the area&#13;
of four Provinces: Hubei, Henan, Sichuan and Shanxi. The city is divided in two&#13;
sections (Fancheng and Xiangyang) by the Han River, the largest tributary of the&#13;
Changjiang River, entering the city from the west. There are four urban districts&#13;
(Xiangcheng, Fandong, Fanxi and Jiaoqu) and two development zones (Xiangfan&#13;
Automobile Industry Zone and Fandong New Hi-Tech Zone). The area of Xiangfan is&#13;
generally flat.&#13;
15.   The total municipal area and population are 326 km and 584,000, respectively, of&#13;
which the urban area and population are 40 km2 and 475,000, respectively. The urban&#13;
2&#13;
population density is just under 12,000 persons per km .&#13;
16.   More than 80 percent of the existing urban area are served by a combined storm&#13;
and wastewater system. Over 80 percent of the population are served by septic tanks.&#13;
Fancheng, on the north side of the Han River, is divided into five drainage areas, three of&#13;
which discharge mainly domestic waste directly into the Han River. The remaining two&#13;
areas, Quinghekou and Qilihe, discharge predominantly industrial waste to the Qili and&#13;
Xiaoqing Rivers, which drain into the Han River. The Qili and Xiaoqing Rivers are&#13;
highly polluted.&#13;
17.   Xiangcheng, on the south side of the Han River, has three drainage systems, two&#13;
of which discharge to the river. The third system, in the old city area, discharges into the&#13;
city moat, which has, as a result, become highly polluted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -           ANNEX 1&#13;
18.   There are two industrial wastewater treatment plants in Xiangfan, each of&#13;
10,000 m3/d capacity. Both plants are owned by textile factories, but operated by the&#13;
Xiangfan Environmental Protection Bureau.  Effluent from these plants, which is&#13;
understood to comply with Chinese national standards, is discharged to the Qili River.&#13;
19.   Planned development to the north and west of Fancheng will add further waste&#13;
loads to Qili River. A major objective of the project, therefore, is to address water quality&#13;
in this river, as well as Xiaoqing River and the city moat.&#13;
Yichang&#13;
20.   Yichang is located in the westem part of Hubei Province on the middle-upper&#13;
reaches of Changjiang River and is the location of the Three Gorges Dam and Ge7houba&#13;
Hydraulic Conservancy Project. The city is divided into two parts by the Changjiang&#13;
River and has three urban districts, Xiling, Wujia and Dianjun. The urban area is long&#13;
and narrow and the region is hilly, between mountainous land and the plains.&#13;
21.   The total municipal area is about 33 kin2, with the urban area covering 29 kM2, or&#13;
about 88 percent of total area. The total population is approximately 479,000, of whom&#13;
391,000 are classified as urban. The population density in the urban area is 13,000&#13;
persons per km .&#13;
22.   Yichang is a major Chinese scenic area and also the country's largest Hydraulic&#13;
Conservancy location. Tourism will gain increasing importance with the construction of&#13;
the Three Gorges Dam. The main industries are power generation, machinery, textile,&#13;
electronics, metallurgical and various light industries.&#13;
23.   The existing urban area is served by a combined storm and wastewater system,&#13;
except for new development areas (e.g., Dongshan Economic Development Zone), where&#13;
separate sewerage and drainage systems are being constructed.  Wastes from this&#13;
development zone are presently being discharged to the Yuen River, with the possibility&#13;
of compromising the city's No. I water supply intake. Waste discharges from elsewhere&#13;
in the city to the Changjiang River could compromise the No. 2 water supply intake. The&#13;
objective of Yichang's Wastewater component would be to collect effluent for discharge&#13;
into the Changjiang downstream from the existing intakes.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 2: DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
I.    The components of the proposed project investments are described in detail below&#13;
and summarized in tabular form.&#13;
A. HUANGSHI&#13;
Wastewater Collection, Treatment and Disposal&#13;
2.    Huangshi City includes a number of scenic lakes, of which the largest freshwater&#13;
lakes are Cihu Lake with a total surface area of approximately 8.4 km2 and Daye Lake&#13;
about 12 km south of the central urban area with a total surface area of approximately&#13;
57 km2. The present total wastewater flow of the city is about 500,000 m3/d, consisting of&#13;
29 percent domestic and 71 percent industrial flows. Cihu Lake carries about 150,000 m3/d&#13;
(30 percent) of the total urban wastewater, and the south arm is severely polluted, mainly by&#13;
industrial wastes. The existing wastewater treatment plant at Huangshigang deals with&#13;
about 20,000 m3/d from the Huangshigang catchment. The wastewater flow in 2010 is&#13;
estimated at about 510,000 m3/d. The proposed municipal wastewater master plan for&#13;
Huangshi urban area for year 2010 includes construction of a major wastewater collection&#13;
and treatment facility to be built at Chenjiawan to deal with the waste flows from&#13;
Shenyanggang, Chenjiawan, Tuanchenshan and Lao Xialu areas. Small systems would be&#13;
built to cover the separate Huahu and Xizai catchments; all these wastewater systems would&#13;
discharge into the Yangtze River. The Master Plan proposes that the wastewater from the&#13;
separate minor catchments of Tieshan, Xialu and Shannan would be treated separately&#13;
before being discharged southward to the Daye Lake.&#13;
3.    The Hluangshi wastewater component is designed to address the pollution of Cihu&#13;
Lake, which is a shallow lake located immediately adjacent to the principal urban area and&#13;
central business district of Huangshi and is an attractive shoreline readily accessible to large&#13;
numbers of urban dwellers. Its beneficial uses are passive recreation, swimming, fishing&#13;
and boating. At present, the lake receives substantial quantities of untreated domestic&#13;
sewage and industrial wastewater, and is significantly polluted; also, the excessive&#13;
concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in the water have accelerated the rate of&#13;
eutrophication and the natural water quality has been progressively degraded.&#13;
4.    The Chenjiwan wastewater system, which is the first priority component of&#13;
Huangshi's master plan, provides for the collection, treatment, and disposal of municipal&#13;
wastewater currently discharged to Cihu Lake. This wastewater system includes three trunk&#13;
sewers collecting municipal wastewater from the northern, central and southern sections of&#13;
the catchmnent area; with preliminary treatment, prior to discharge to the Yangtze River via&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -                     ANNEX2&#13;
the existing Shanyanggang canal, thus preventing the continued discharge of untreated&#13;
municipal wastewater to Cihu Lake. The effective management of further nutrient addition&#13;
to the lake would reduce the rate of eutrophication, thereby improving the water quality in&#13;
the Lake to enhance the amenity, recreational and land use values of surrounding areas.&#13;
Due to financial constraints, only the first phase of the system, comprising the southem&#13;
interceptor and preliminary treatment would be implemented under the project.&#13;
5.    Proposed Component ($11.9 million). The proposed component would comprise&#13;
the following works:&#13;
(a)   Chenjianwan Southern Trunks and Interceptors including about 6 km of&#13;
sewers ranging in size from about 1,200 to 1,500 mm diameter. Miaopu and&#13;
Yegang pump stations of about 68,000 and 96,000 m3/d capacity, and force&#13;
mains of about 1,000 mm diameter.&#13;
(b)   Southern Collection Sewers including about 9 km of sewers ranging from&#13;
about 400 to 800 mm diameter to discharge to southem trunk sewers.&#13;
(c)   Chenjianwan  Preliminary  Treatment Plant and  Pump  Station&#13;
comprising screens, grit removal facilities, pumping equipment of about&#13;
160,000 m3/d capacity, and 1.1 km delivery main of about 1,600 mm&#13;
diameter to discharge treated effluent to the Shanyanggang canal.&#13;
Municipal Wastes Management&#13;
6.    The objective of this component is to improve the primary collection system by the&#13;
construction of small transfer stations, provision of additional trucks for transport of solid&#13;
waste from transfer stations to landfill and the replacement of open collection trucks by&#13;
larger closed compactor vehicles for areas where waste is picked up from collection points&#13;
for direct delivery to landfill.  For final disposal, the first stage of a move from&#13;
semicontrolled landfill to fully controlled landfill operation meeting state-approved&#13;
standards will be taken by the provision of a new landfill at Xisai. To improve nightsoil&#13;
and sludge collection, vacuum trucks will be provided.&#13;
7.    The new landfill will be controlled and operated by the Huangshi City Appearance&#13;
and Environmental Sanitation Bureau (HCA&amp;ESB), which is responsible to the Huangshi&#13;
Urban Construction Commission (HUCC) for the management of municipal solid waste&#13;
and nightsoil collection and disposal. The urban district environmental sanitation bureaus&#13;
(ESBs) of Huangshi, Shihuiyao, Xialu and Tieshan will continue to be responsible for&#13;
providing municipal solid waste and nightsoil collection services and street sweeping.&#13;
Industrial and commercial enterprises and institutions will retain the responsibility for&#13;
transportation and disposal of their own wastes, but may request the ESBs to provide these&#13;
services on payment of the appropriate service fees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

transportation of waste from  transfer stations and  20 0.5-ton small&#13;
collection trucks to provide primary collection services in selected areas&#13;
with restricted access; and (ii) for nightsoil and sludge collection and&#13;
disposal: procurement of 12 vacuum trucks.&#13;
(c)    Sanitary Landfill:  site preparation works and construction of a new&#13;
sanitary landfill to national standards at a 12.4 ha site of mainly derelict land&#13;
at Xisai, adjoining a large chemical plant. The valley site has a volume of&#13;
some 1.25 million m 3 and, with the proposed design capacity of around&#13;
150 tpd rising to 300 tpd, would have an estimated life of at least 15 years.&#13;
The preliminary design includes provision of gas and leachate treatment&#13;
systems, site offices, weighbridge, maintenance and labor facilities, a 5 m-&#13;
wide all-weather access road of some 1.2 km, a steel-wheeled compactor for&#13;
consolidation of the waste, and two small bulldozers, three 5-ton dump&#13;
trucks for moving and spreading covering material.&#13;
(d)   Institutional Development and Training: provision will be made for&#13;
institutional development and practical training of both management and&#13;
operational personnel, with particular attention being given to the control,&#13;
management and monitoring necessary to effectively operate a sanitary&#13;
landfill.&#13;
B. WUHAN&#13;
Wastewater Collection, Treatment and Disposal&#13;
9.    Wuhan Wuchang Central Wastewater System. The Wuhan Wuchang central&#13;
wastewater component is designed to address the pollution of the East Lake, which is the&#13;
source of drinking water for the population of the lake area, and with banks extending over&#13;
111.5 km, is one of the most important scenic attractions in Wuhan. It is also used for&#13;
recreational purposes and fish farming, as well as being the site for research on aquatic&#13;
ecology. The lake has been receiving substantial quantities of municipal and industrial&#13;
wastewater for many years, currently estimated at 180,000 m3/d. The lake is significantly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -                     ANNEX2&#13;
polluted and has thick deposits of sludge on the bottom, which contains high concentrations&#13;
of heavy metals, nutrients and other contamninants.&#13;
10.   The component provides for the collection, treatment, and disposal of municipal&#13;
wastewater currently discharged to the lake, and, in Stage I, provides for the interception of&#13;
all wastewater and primary treatment augmentation at the existing Shahu plant, new&#13;
Erlangmiao and Longwanzui wastewater collection and primary treatment facilities.&#13;
Effluents from the facilities flow, respectively, to the Luojiagang Canal for discharge to the&#13;
Yangtze River and to Nanhu Lake to significantly improve water quality in the Lake to&#13;
facilitate the continued use of the resource for municipal water supply and to enhance&#13;
amenity value. Municipal service delivery would be improved for about 0.9 million&#13;
persons presently living in the catchment area. In order to prevent drawdown of the water&#13;
level in East Lake, water balance facilities from the Yangtze River would be provided.&#13;
11.   Hankou Wastewater System.  The Hankou wastewater system provides for&#13;
additional wastewater collection and preliminary treatmnent facilities in West Hankou, with&#13;
effluent discharge to the Fu River, to improve the standard of municipal services for this&#13;
major center of population currently experiencing rapid urban development. Risks to public&#13;
health would be reduced and the standard of amenity improved in a densely populated&#13;
urban area, thus benefiting some 800,000 persons.&#13;
12.   Hanyang Wastewater System. Wastewater from the predominantly industrial area&#13;
of Hanyang is presently discharged untreated into the Moshui Lake, where water quality is&#13;
poor (below Class V Chinese Standard). This shallow lake provides beneficial uses&#13;
including fish farming, and important recreational facilities at the adjacent zoological&#13;
gardens. The Hanyang system would provide wastewater collection, preliminary treatment&#13;
and effluent disposal facilities, improving the Moshui Lake beneficial use and providing&#13;
improved municipal service to some 200,000 inhabitants in the Nantaizihu Lake catchment.&#13;

Wastewater Collection, Treatment and Disposal&#13;
17.   Xiangfan City is situated mainly on the banks of the Han River with some&#13;
development spreading up the Tangbai, Xiaoqing and Qili Rivers. The central urban&#13;
districts are divided by the Han River into the southern, mainly residential and old town&#13;
area of Xiangcheng and the northern, predominantly industrial and commercial area of&#13;
Fancheng. Wastewater from five combined sewer systems in Fancheng is discharged&#13;
directly to the Han River through six outlets along the left bank of the River and via the Qili&#13;
and Xiaoqing Rivers. Sewerage from three drainage systems in Xiangcheng is discharged&#13;
to the old moat and Nanqu ditch and ultimately to the Han River. The present urban&#13;
wastewater flow is around 500,000 m3/d, comprising about 40 percent domestic flow and&#13;
60 percent from industrial sources. Three existing treatment plants, with a combined&#13;
capacity of about 40,000 m3/d, are located in Fancheng and Youfanfgang (20,000 m3/d).&#13;
The average wastewater flow in 2010 is projected around 1,000,000 m /d.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

18.   The Xiangfan Wastewater Master Plan includes the proposed Xiangfan central&#13;
urban wastewater system, which covers the areas of Fancheng and Xiangfen. This proposed&#13;
scheme would intercept the wastewater from the existing combined sewers in these areas,&#13;
provide collector systems discharging to a treatment facility to be established on&#13;
Yuliangzhou Island, which is located on the east side of the Han River. The master plan&#13;
proposes that wastewater from the outlying areas of Youfanggang, Zhangwan, Dongjin and&#13;
Yujiahu would be provided with separate collection and treatment systems to intercept&#13;
municipal wastewater flows, which presently discharge to the Han, Qili, and Xiaoqing&#13;
Rivers; the Moat and Nanqu ditch.&#13;
19.   The objective of this component, which is the first phase of an integrated program,&#13;
is to provide improved municipal services and environmental conditions for about 250,000&#13;
persons in the most densely populated (Fancheng) area of the city, through effective&#13;
wastewater interception, treatment and disposal. The component would significantly reduce&#13;
pollution of the Xiaoqing and Qilihe Rivers, thereby reducing the risk of contamination of&#13;
water supply intakes located on the Han River.&#13;
20.   Proposed Component ($48.0 million). The proposed component would comprise&#13;
the following works:&#13;
(a)   Fancheng Interceptor and Sewer System comprising about 14 km of&#13;
trunk sewers ranging in size from 600 to 2,000 mm diameter, about 6 km of&#13;
culvert in sizes between 1.4 m x 1.2 m high and 3.2 m x 2.0 m high, pump&#13;
station of about 525,000 m3/d capacity, access bridge across Han River to&#13;
Yuliangzhou Island, and about 3 km of 2,200 mm diameter force main.&#13;
(b)   Yuliangzhou Preliminary Treatment Plant comprising screening, grit&#13;
removal facilities of about 600,000 m3/d capacity, and outfall of about&#13;
1,800 mm diameter to Han River.&#13;
Municipal Wastes Management&#13;
21.   The objectives of this component are to improve the efficiency and environmental&#13;
standards of waste collection and disposal. To help achieve this, 16 transfer stations will be&#13;
constructed. The first phase of a new landfill will be constructed at a site yet to be finalized,&#13;
in the northem area of the city to supplement the present semicontrolled landfill at&#13;
Huoshishan in the south. The new landfill will be designed and operated to approved&#13;
national standards.&#13;
22.   The landfill will be controlled and operated by the Xiangfan Environmental&#13;
Sanitation Department (XESD), which is responsible to the Xiangfan Urban Construction&#13;
Commission (XUCC) for the management of municipal solid waste and nightsoil collection&#13;
and disposal. The city's three urban district ESBs will continue to be responsible for&#13;
providing these services and street sweeping, under the guidance and supervision of XESD.&#13;
Industrial and commercial enterprises and institutions will retain the responsibility for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -                      ANNEX2&#13;
transportation and disposal of their own wastes, but may request the ESBs to provide these&#13;
services on payment of the appropriate service fees.&#13;
23.   Proposed Component ($5.4 million). The proposed solid waste management&#13;
component is as follows:&#13;
(a)    Sanitary Landfill: site preparation works and construction a new landfill to&#13;
national standards at a site north of the city. The preliminary design&#13;
standards include provision of gas and leachate treatment systems, site&#13;
offices, weighbridge, site and vehicle maintenance and labor facilities and an&#13;
all-weather access road. For site operations, one steel-wheeled compactor&#13;
for consolidation of the wastes, one bulldozer, one loading shovel, and three&#13;
5-ton dump trucks for excavating and spreading will be provided, together&#13;
with one car, one pickup truck and one personnel carrier for supervision and&#13;

1). YICHANG&#13;
Municipal Wastes Management&#13;
24.   The objectives of this component are to improve the efficiency and environmental&#13;
standards of waste disposal. In addition to nightsoil and sludge collection upgrading, the&#13;
first phase of a new landfill will be constructed at Huangjiawan, in the north of the city, to&#13;
supplement the present semicontrolled landfill at Ganxigou in the central area. The new&#13;
landfill will be designed and operated to national standards.&#13;
25.   The landfill will be controlled and operated by the Yichang Environmental&#13;
Sanitation Department (YESD), which is responsible to the Yichang Urban Construction&#13;
Commission (YUCC) for the management of municipal solid waste and nightsoil collection&#13;
and disposal. The city's three urban district ESDs will continue to be responsible for&#13;
providing these services and street sweeping, under the guidance and supervision of YESD.&#13;
Industrial and commercial enterprises and institutions will retain responsibility for the&#13;
transportation and disposal of their own wastes, but may request the ESDs to provide these&#13;
services on payment of the appropriate service fees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -                      ANNEX2&#13;
26.   Proposed Component ($9.1 million). The proposed component is as follows:&#13;
(a)   Sanitary Landfill:  site preparation works and construction of a new&#13;
landfill to national standards at Huangjiawan, some 8 km from the city&#13;
center. The site has a surface area of some 20.0 ha and a volume of&#13;
2.8 million m3. At the proposed design capacity of 420 tpd rising to 500 tpd,&#13;
this would give an estimated life of some 15 years. The preliminary design&#13;
includes provision of gas and leachate treatment and monitoring systems,&#13;
site offices, weighbridge, maintenance and labor facilities and a 2.5 km all-&#13;
weather access road. For site operations, one steel-wheeled compactor for&#13;
consolidation of the waste, one bulldozer, one loading shovel and three 5-ton&#13;
dump trucks for excavating and spreading cover will be provided, together&#13;
with one 4-four-wheel-drive jeep and one personnel carrier for supervision&#13;
and general duties.&#13;
(b)   Vacuum Trucks for Nightsoil and Sludge Collection: purchase of five&#13;
trucks&#13;
(c)   Institutional Development and Training: provision will be made for&#13;
institutional development and practical training of both management and&#13;
operational personnel, with particular attention being given to the control,&#13;
management and monitoring necessary to effectively operate a sanitary&#13;
landfill.&#13;
E. INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION CONTROL SUBPROJECTS&#13;
27.   The industrial pollution control subprojects have been designed to achieve both&#13;
pollution reduction and improvements in operational efficiency through structural&#13;
transformation to efficient and low polluting technologies, waste minimization/reuse and, as&#13;
appropriate, product upgrading. The component would assist targeted large-scale industrial&#13;
enterprises to bring their effluent discharge to comply with national, or local, standards in a&#13;
cost-effective manner.&#13;
28.   A pipeline of large-scale projects, amounting to about $50 million of subloans, has&#13;
been screened by the Bank/IDA and certified by the local EPBs as requiring immediate&#13;
cleanup measures. A line-of-credit of $45 million would be provided under the proposed&#13;
Bank Loan/IDA Credit to help finance the subloans. The proposed Bank/IDA-financed&#13;
subloan for each subproject would be limited to 100 percent of foreign exchange c -sts, or&#13;
50 percent of total subproject costs, whichever is higher.&#13;
29.   Subproject Appraisal Arrangements.  The environmental/technical appraisal&#13;
would include (a) an assessment of the subproject's consistency with the municipal&#13;
environmental strategy and its priority; (b) the impact of the proposed subproject on&#13;
pollution prevention and reduction; and (c) compliance with national/local environmental&#13;
regulations. The economic appraisal would have to demonstrate that (a) all feasible options&#13;
for pollution reduction have been examined and that the solution proposed is the most cost-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -                     ANNEX2&#13;
effective; and (b) the enterprises generating the pollution are economically viable. The&#13;
financial appraisal would assess the financial viability of the enterprises and test the debt&#13;
service coverage ratio of the enterprises, which should be no less than 1.4 times. The&#13;
Bank/IDA would review all subproject appraisal reports in full, including two during&#13;
project appraisal, to assure itself of the quality of the appraisal reports submitted.&#13;
F. HUBEI ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION CONTROL FUND&#13;
30.   Proposed Component ($5.0 million). This component would provide loan funds&#13;
to finance small-scale, high environmental impact investments in clean technology process&#13;
change, supporting the core investments in air and wastewater management. These finds,&#13;
together with funds now generated through HEPB-administered pollution levy fees, would&#13;
be administered by HEPB, through the segregated accounts and independent operating rules&#13;
of HEPCF. The appraisal arrangements for these investments parallel those for the&#13;
Industrial Pollution Control component given in the previous paragraph.&#13;
G. WATER QUALITY MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
31.   Proposed Component ($2.9 million). The objective of this component is to&#13;

ANNEX 6: LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
Overall Preparation of Resettlement Action Plans&#13;
1.    Prior to appraisal, all project cities presented the Bank with resettlement plans for&#13;
those project components requiring land acquisition. The appraisal mission requested&#13;
additional information on certain aspects of the plans and that information, together with the&#13;
original plans, provides the basis for appraisal of resettlement for the project components&#13;
requiring resettlement. All project cities-Wuhan, Xiangfan, Yichang, and Huangshi-&#13;
have such components, as do several of the enterprises proposed for support under the line&#13;
of credit.&#13;
2.    The resettlement plans for individual cities and enterprises share many features, due&#13;
to the fact that all were developed within the same regulatory framework (described in&#13;
Chapter 2 of China: Involuntary Resettlement, Report 11641-CHA). The Bank review of&#13;
Chinese resettlement policy showed that basing compensation on collective land ownership&#13;
(for rural communities) or enterprises (in urban areas) effectively protected the interests of&#13;
all groups but the unregistered population (migrants who have not been given the right of&#13;
permnanent abode). The preparation of resettlement plans in this project was done with&#13;
special attention to possible impacts on members of the unregistered population. Several&#13;
such people have been identified as affected by resettlement, and appropriate measures&#13;
taken to indemnify them, as explained in the text.&#13;
3.    In each city (including cities in which project-assisted enterprises are sited), the&#13;
resettlement efforts will be executed by the city land administration bureau, or another&#13;
government agency with special responsibility for resettlement. All project cities have large&#13;
ongoing investment programs that involve substantial resettlement and the assigned&#13;
agencies are therefore experienced in this work. The executing agencies are those typically&#13;
used in resettlement work and acknowledged in the Bank's resettlement review to be well&#13;
placed to execute the work. Each will be required to submit quarterly reports on their&#13;
efforts under the Bank project. The project offices in each city, together with the provincial&#13;
project office, shall be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the resettlement effort. In&#13;
addition, an independent agency will be retained to evaluate resettlement performance at&#13;
regular intervals during active resettlement and 12 months after the last resettlement occurs.&#13;
4.    Project components are expected to acquire over 140 hectares (ha) in some 25&#13;
discrete sites. This will lead to the permanent relocation of 39 families and temporary&#13;
relocation of 137 families. It will also cause some 996 people to be given new jobs on land&#13;
within their current company on village, given jobs with new companies, or switch to new&#13;
places of self-employment due to loss of cultivated land, fish ponds, or industrial or&#13;

commercial opportunities. Using the broad Chinese definition of affected people (which&#13;
factors in dependents of those losing income streams), a total of some 3,912 people will be&#13;
affected by project-induced resettlement. Tables 1, 2 and 3 show the distribution of&#13;
resettlement among the project components, resettlement timing and budgets.&#13;

5.    In addition to the discussions with the provincial project office, preappraisal and&#13;
appraisal missions conducted separate discussions and field trips among all subcomponents&#13;
in order to understand the basic scope of and preparation for land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement. These discussions included project affected people, to validate the findings of&#13;
the consultants on the participation process. A brief summary follows of the major mission&#13;
and consultant findings. The full resettlement plan, dated November 3, 1995, can be found&#13;
in the project files.&#13;
Wuhan Wastewater Component&#13;
6.    The proposed wastewater component includes the construction or expansion of five&#13;
treatment plants and seven pumping stations, together with approximately 90 km of&#13;
wastewater conveyors. Sites are scattered around the city, with the largest sites on the&#13;
agricultural margins of the urban area. The largest site (Longwanzui) requires acquisition&#13;
of 32.6 ha and the pumping station sites the smallest at 0.2 ha each. The wastewater&#13;
interceptors will be built along existing drainage canals or under roadways and therefore&#13;
require no additional land acquisition. Land taken has been planned to avoid any housing&#13;
removal, so all project impacts will be on income alone. An estimated 430 workers and&#13;
farmers will need new employment to restore these income streams. The total impact of the&#13;
Wuhan wastewater component will therefore be about half of total labor displacement. The&#13;
sites of five pumping stations had not been determined at appraisal. Once that is decided,&#13;
the needed supplementary resettlement information will be provided to the Bank/IDA.&#13;
7.    Because land acquisition will not require any housing removal, communities will&#13;
remain physically intact after resettlement. Therefore, if lost income streams can be&#13;
replaced through alternative employment in the neighborhood of current employment, the&#13;
social and economic fabric of the community will not be threatened by resettlement. The&#13;
land to be acquired virtually all falls under collective ownership (the exception being some&#13;
pump station land owned by state-owned enterprises). These collective lands are for the&#13;
most part controlled by collective-owned companies, in which the affected people are&#13;
employees. Land or fish ponds managed outside of such company control are typicallv&#13;
under contract to individual households within the village, though in one village such&#13;
contracts are also held by non-village (that is, unregistered) workers.&#13;
8.    Chinese resettlement compensation strategies are based on the productivitv of the&#13;
land acquired, where that productivity is measured in gross unit output value, times a&#13;
negotiated multiplier. In practice, both the base productivity figure and the multiplier are&#13;
negotiable, and depend in part on the perceived market value of the land. In this project,&#13;
agreed compensation averaged Y 1.5 million/ha ($178,000/ha) in Wuhan. Detail-, of&#13;
compensation are given in the RAP. The appraisal mission reviewed feasibility ol&#13;
compensation in terms of its ability to replace lost income. It did so by comparing the&#13;
quantum of compensation to current net income derived from the land. By this measure.&#13;
compensation was no less than 20 times net annual income.  At these levels ctf&#13;
compensation, risk-free investment in government bonds (which currently pav about&#13;
11 percent interest and are inflation-indexed) would yield incomes more than wice lhal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-100 -                      ANNEX6&#13;
forgone due to the acquisition. Additionally, labor would be freed to pursue other&#13;
productive pursuits. The appraisal mission judged that this compensation level permits&#13;
the affected units to meet the goal of fully protecting, or improving, standards of living&#13;
after resettlement.&#13;
9.    The question remains of how the collective will handle the displaced labor. Details&#13;
of their intentions have been given in the RAPs, but the basic strategy is to reemploy people&#13;
in other collective enterprises in the village or on other village lands or ponds. This strategy&#13;
is riskier than the government bond strategy, but has the advantage of providing&#13;
employment rather than simply a long term subsidy and, also potentially higher long term&#13;
income streams. It should also be noted that the resettled workers do not face a risk from&#13;
this strategy higher than that faced by all members of the affected collective, for the&#13;
collective ownership of the assets and employment spreads the risk over all villagers. It&#13;
should also be noted that all affected villages have other recent experience of involuntary&#13;
resettlement, with which they have successfully coped. They are all being absorbed into&#13;
greater urban Wuhan and as growth continues will doubtless lose their agricultural status&#13;
altogether. This process is hastened by the current project, but to this time adequate&#13;
agricultural land remains to allow those preferring agriculture to continue in that pursuit in&#13;
all but one affected village.&#13;
10.   In one village, four unregistered households with 16 members had signed a contract&#13;
to manage some of the fish ponds that will be lost. Their management contracts stated that&#13;
if the ponds were acquired by the state, no compensation would be due. However, the&#13;
village has undertaken to reemploy the workers in these families in township enterprises, so&#13;
compensation has indeed been rendered.&#13;
Wuhan Solid Waste Component&#13;
11.   This component will acquire 17.7 ha of land currently employing 176 people. In&#13;
this case, the land will be acquired from a state-owned aquatic farming enterprise that has&#13;
total holdings of over 4,000 ha of land and employs about 8,000 workers. The displaced&#13;
employees were not attached to the land in any contractual sense, but represent the average&#13;
employment per hectare across all farm holdings. Of the affected land, 12 ha was used&#13;
under loan from the district land administration bureau, which is also claiming&#13;
compensation for a permanent transfer of rights to the Environmental Sanitation Bureau. In&#13;
the agreement reached, the company will be compensated with Y 1,500,000 ($178,000) per&#13;
ha. and redeploy labor as necessary. The affected laborers will therefore experience no&#13;
change in status or income.&#13;
Huangshi Wastewater Component&#13;
12.   The Huangshi wastewvater component will require the construction of three major&#13;
wastewater conveyors and a treatment plant outfall pipe totaling some 15 km in length. In&#13;
addition, a new wastewater treatment plant with a capacity of 175,000 m3/day will be&#13;
constructed. Although interceptors will, for the most part, be laid in the watercourses&#13;
currently serving as open sewers and drains, a total of 5 ha of land and fish ponds will need&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-101-                       ANNEX6&#13;
to be acquired, with two-thirds of this for the treatment plant. No families will lose their&#13;
houses to the project, but a total of 3 agricultural workers will need reemployment.&#13;
13.   The three agricultural workers needing reemployment had contracted 60 mu of fish&#13;
ponds from the Hubin Company, and were said to net some Y 1,800 per mu. The&#13;
compensation paid to the Hubin Company for labor resettlement totals Y 600,000, over five&#13;
times the net income and adequate to allow risk-free investment to cover all lost income in&#13;
place in eight-year bank accounts now yielding 18.64 percent.&#13;
Huangshi Solid Waste Component&#13;
14.   The provision of a sanitary landfill facility for Huangshi will require the acquisition&#13;
of a 12.5 ha parcel of agricultural land in the city suburbs. By acquiring nearly 30 percent&#13;
of the village land, the project will displace approximately 61 agricultural laborers who will&#13;
need alternative employment. Current agricultural income levels average about Y 2,400&#13;
annually. The village will receive some Y 2.5 million to compensate for the lost land and&#13;
jobs, or 17 times annual income. Again, a risk-free strategy with total income replacement&#13;
is available.  However, using these funds, the village intends to create alternative&#13;
employment in village enterprises. The village transport service would employ 5 men and&#13;
the construction team 26 men. The village owns catering unit, which will absorb 20 of the&#13;
displaced women workers. The remaining 10 women will be offered jobs in village-owned&#13;
shops. Wages will average Y 4,800, well above the average farm income level. Any&#13;
enterprise-based village resettlement scheme opens the workers to the risk that the&#13;
enterprise will not prosper. However, village enterprises essentially cross-insure against&#13;
such risk, as workers can be reassigned among them  as conditions warrant.  The&#13;
compensation levels are high enough that even enterprises with rates of return below those&#13;
of village enterprises as a whole will be able to meet the replacement wage bill.&#13;
Vichang Solid Waste Component&#13;
15.   The provision of a sanitary landfill facility for Yichang will require the acquisition&#13;
of a 24.3 ha parcel of agricultural land in a suburban village, taking about one fifth of total&#13;
village cultivated land. Site clearance will require 11 families (with 44 members) to&#13;
relocate their housing and 177 affected people will need new employment. The families&#13;
needing new housing will be allocated house plots in one of two existing housing clusters&#13;
within the boundaries of the existing village. Compensation will be negotiated based on the&#13;
principle of maintaining and increasing living standards. Families will make their own&#13;
arrangements for new construction and express confidence in maintaining their living&#13;
standards.&#13;
16.   To facilitate labor resettlement, the environmental sanitation bureau project office&#13;
offered one job per affected family in the landfill, with financial compensation to allow the&#13;
other family members to reconstruct their livelihoods. However, the affected villagers have&#13;
built a successful vegetable growing business, with net incomes about Y 2,400 per year, and&#13;
none was willing to become a landfill worker. Therefore, the vi'.lage governmelit hlis&#13;
elected to redistribute existing village lands to ensure that all families continue as farmer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-102 -                      ANNEX6&#13;
The Y 4.25 million to be paid to the village (some Y 268,000 per lost job) will be used to&#13;
upgrade the existing land and purchase agricultural inputs so that per capita production and&#13;
incomes can be maintained on the reduced land base.&#13;
Xiangfan Wastewater Component&#13;
17.   The proposed wastewater conveyor system and treatment plant for the Fancheng&#13;
area of Xiangfan will require the laying of 20 km of wastewater interceptors and conveyors,&#13;
a pipe bridge conveying the wastewater to Yuliangzhou, an island in the Han River, a 3 km&#13;
long conveyor to a treatment plant and then discharge to the Han. The interceptors and&#13;
conveyors will be routed along existing drains and streets in built-up areas. Nonetheless,&#13;
construction will compels families to permanently relocate and 137 families to temporarily&#13;
relocate during a one month construction period and for new houses to be provided on the&#13;
old sites, or original houses restored, at the end of that period. The treatment plant is on an&#13;
island prone to flooding before the construction of the Danjiangkou reservoir and the plant&#13;
site has no agricultural activity. The acquisition of a 0.06 ha workshop of the Xiangfan Ship&#13;
Factory will require relocation of this operation to the main company complex. Acquisition&#13;
is not expected to materially affect company operations or employment.&#13;
18.   The biggest resettlement challenge in the project is handling the temporary&#13;
relocation of the 137 families. The families have all been visited, a census taken, and&#13;
resettlement arrangements discussed. The temporary housing, which they expect to occupy&#13;
for less than a month will be located close to their present dwellings. In most cases, only a&#13;
part of the original house will be affected. In other cases, houses must be torn down during&#13;
construction and the construction unit will be responsible for assisting them to rebuild new&#13;
housing of at least equal size and quality. During the temporary relocation, their housing&#13;
will be provided at no cost, and a relocation allowance will be paid for both moves. The&#13;
move itself will be undertaken by the construction company.&#13;
19.   The census revealed one family that did not have an urban residence permit. Under&#13;
resettlement regulations, they are not eligible for resettlement. However, the city decided to&#13;
provide them the same arrangements as all other families. To avoid legitimizing their de&#13;
facto residence, the city has listed them not by the farnily name, but as "a family from a&#13;
lower government jurisdiction."&#13;
Xiangfan Solid Waste Component&#13;
20.   The provision of a sanitary landfill facility for Xiangfan will require the acquisition&#13;
of a parcel of land in a northern suburban village. Final site selection remains to be made.&#13;
Once the selection is confinned, a separate RAP will be prepared and appraised.&#13;
Jingmen Cement General Plant Component&#13;
21.   This cement plant will relocate to a new, 11.5 ha site in Meiman village of Ziling&#13;
town. The site includes the housing of 16 families of 59 people, all of whom will be&#13;
resettled within Meiman village at a distance of no more than I km from their current&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-103 -                      ANNEX6&#13;
housing. The land acquired was used for housing and associated gardening and house-&#13;
based activities. Crops were not planted on this land, which is of generally low quality for&#13;
agriculture.&#13;
22.   The families needing new housing have negotiated compensation based on housing&#13;
size and condition, averaging about Y 42,000 per house (the current housing averages just&#13;
under 70 m2 per family and is of brick and tile construction). Families will be allocated&#13;
house plots of size equal to the current plots, allowing resumption of home garden and other&#13;
activities. They will make their own arrangements for new construction and express&#13;
confidence in maintaining their living standards.&#13;
23.   Aside from the housing situation, just described, the land yielded little cash income.&#13;
As a village common land, it produced less than Y 3,750 per ha in income, or Y 43,000&#13;
total. Because current farming activities will not be affected, no labor resettlement is&#13;
needed. Based on the resettlement regulations, the village has negotiated a payment of&#13;
Y 1. I million for lost use of the land, which would yield Y 126,000 in risk-free income.&#13;
Yichang City Cement General Plant&#13;
24.   This cement plant will relocate to a new site of 11.5 ha in Huangshan village, 15 km&#13;
from Yichang. This will require 7 families with 25 members to move their houses and will&#13;
take 9.3 ha of cultivated land and fish ponds. The cultivated land take will displace an&#13;
estimated 119 workers, all of whom will need new jobs.&#13;
25.   As in other villages so affected, each family will be given a new house plot at least&#13;
as large as the old and within the existing village. In this village, affected housing has a&#13;
wider quality range than in other affected villages, with the best housing being two-story&#13;
brick-and-concrete construction and the worst adobe and wood. Compensation averages&#13;
just over Y 35,000 per family, with a high of Y 57,000 and low of Y 8,700. Again, as in&#13;
other villages, the owners will make their own rebuilding arrangements. The compensation&#13;
received is judged adequate by the owners to replace their current housing to an equal or&#13;
higher standard.&#13;
26.   The cement plant has offered to solve the labor resettlement problem by offering the&#13;
villagers staff positions in the new plant. The village will be able to offer residents the&#13;
opportunity to continue as farmers or work in the plant. The plant jobs are expected to be in&#13;
demand, as they offer much more in income and benefits than the Y 200 a month average in&#13;
farming. The village anticipates that most families will seek to keep some members ill&#13;
agriculture and place others in the plant, thus minimizing family risks while also enjoying&#13;
an increase in income.&#13;
Xiangfan City Chemical Plant Component&#13;
27.   The phosphate workshop of this plant will be removed to the phosphate rock&#13;
minehead, requiring the acquisition of 3 ha of land. That land is currently in agriculture,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-104-                         ANNEX6&#13;
and its loss will require the labor resettlement of 30 workers. No housing will be lost to the&#13;
project.&#13;
28.   To meet labor resettlement needs, 30 workers will be offered jobs in the phosphate&#13;
workshop. Average worker income in the Chemical Plant now runs about Y 5,000 per year,&#13;
in contrast to the Y 1,000 annual average income in the affected village. Employment in&#13;
the plant will therefore result in substantial income gains for the affected people. In&#13;
addition to those jobs, the village will be paid Y 1.35 million, which it can use to improve&#13;
conditions for those not directly benefiting from new jobs.&#13;
Resettlement Supervision&#13;
29.   Resettlement supervision under this project depends on a combination of normal&#13;
Chinese administrative procedure and project-specific actions. In each city, the Land&#13;
Administration Bureau has responsibility for ensuring that resettlement activities proceed&#13;
as national and local regulations require. Their supervisory activities most often find&#13;
expression through routine audits of affected collectives to see that allocated funds are&#13;
properly disbursed. Any grievance action by an affected unit or person will also trigger&#13;
special supervision.&#13;
30.   This project has two additional mechanisms to guard the interests of resettlers.&#13;
The first mechanism requires that project entities report quarterly to the provincial project&#13;
office on the progress of resettlement, detailing physical and financial progress in the&#13;
resettlement component. Simultaneously, affected collectives and enterprises are also&#13;
requested to file quarterly reports on compensation received, physical relocation, and any&#13;
issues arising. The provincial project office will review the reports for consistency and&#13;
follow-up on any problems identified. The second mechanism is that of formal outside&#13;
evaluation of resettlement activities during and subsequent to resettlement. Based on&#13;
resettlement schedules, the first evaluation is expected to take place in December 1996.&#13;
the second in June 1997, then, based on experience to date, a schedule of further external&#13;
evaluation to be defined, with a final evaluation 12 months after the final resettlement&#13;
activity.  Resettlement problems identified during either of these two additional&#13;
supervisory mechanisms will be handled first through negotiation among affected parties,&#13;
then, if that is unsuccessful, through referral to the Land Administration Bureau system&#13;
for formnal disposition.&#13;
Additional Resettlement Action Plans&#13;
31.   Every proposed investment under the Industrial Pollution Control component and&#13;
the HEPCF will be evaluated for possible resettlement impacts. If resettlement will occur, a&#13;
RAP, acceptable to the Bank/IDA, will be prepared. Likewise, any changes in project&#13;
design will be evaluated for resettlement impact and the RAP would be amended, in a&#13;
manner acceptable to the Bank/IDA, as necessary to reflect such changes.&#13;

ANNEX 7: ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT SUMMARY&#13;
Background&#13;
1.   In 1993 the Government of China and the World Bank agreed to prepare a possible&#13;
loan for the improvement of the urban environment in four major cities in Hubei Province.&#13;
lhe project would provide approximately $160 million to the municipalities of Wuhan,&#13;
Xiangfan, Huangshi and Yichang for improvements in wastewater collection and disposal,&#13;
nightsoil collection and disposal and urban solid waste collection and disposal. For the&#13;
control of industrial pollution, some $30 million would be provided to control both water&#13;
and air pollution in highly polluting industries. The project would be an important first&#13;
effort to clean up urban lakes and rivers along the middle reaches of the Yangtze as well as&#13;
to begin dealing with serious air pollution problems.&#13;
2.    The lack of sound environmental management is now at a critical juncture in Hubei&#13;
Province as the pace of industrial development continues. Routinely, both domestic and&#13;
industrial liquid wastes are discharged into rivers, sewers and lakes untreated. Most of&#13;
these water bodies have seriously deteriorated to Class III or IV over the past few years with&#13;
several lakes such as East Lake in Wuhan becoming eutrophic and displaying algal blooms&#13;
each summer. Biological diversity in these lakes is also narrowing with the succession of&#13;
several species of carp and deposition of thick sludge layers on lake bottoms. Water&#13;
supplies must be drawn from Class II reaches of the Yangtze away frorn urban centers.&#13;
3.    In the realm of solid waste, little or no sanitary landfill practices are used. Most&#13;
solid waste is simply dumped along the periphery of cities. There is no treatment of&#13;
leachate that enters either surface waters or groundwater. Collection and transfer practices&#13;
are generally good but disposal remains a serious issue since the price of land has risen&#13;
sharply in urban areas. Modern landfill practices are therefore necessary in order to&#13;
maximize use of scarce land areas set aside for disposal. Major investment in all four&#13;
project cities for landfills, transfer stations and vehicles is therefore necessary.&#13;
4.    The project consists of over two dozen components, all with separate EAs&#13;
performed by local design and research institutes. Coordination of these studies was carried&#13;
out by HUEPO and a final, overall project EA, dated May, 1995, was prepared by Chinese&#13;
Research Academy of Environmental Sciences located in Beijing. Each of the component&#13;
EAs was reviewed at a detailed level with the overall EA providing conclusions of each.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-106 -                        ANNEX7&#13;
Basic Environmental Strategy&#13;
5.    In the area of water quality, Hubei authorities have chosen to apply an interim&#13;
environmental strategy that seeks to maximize the potential of the Yangtze River for self-&#13;
purification in the short run because of its large flows (23,400 m3/sec). This strategy&#13;
basically seeks to improve the quality of lakes and streams by diverting wastewater flows to&#13;
the river via large collectors and outfalls. Prior to discharge into the Yangtze, pretreatment&#13;
on primary treatment facilities are provided to remove solids and grit but not biological&#13;
treatment is planned in the short term for economic reasons. Hubei authorities propose to&#13;
go to primary and secondary treatment as additional financing becomes available and&#13;
depending on the biological condition of the Yangtze River as these new waste flows are&#13;
added.&#13;
6.    Sound solid waste management in Hubei Province is severely limited by the scarcity&#13;
of landfill capacity. Informal dumps exist at the periphery of most cities that need to be&#13;
upgraded to sanitary landfills. The project will establish such landfills in each of the four&#13;
cities as an pilot or demonstration so that other landfills can be developed by local&#13;
authorities. The strategy is to develop these sites so that more refuse can be disposed of in&#13;
the future as waste flows increase with population and general economic conditions.&#13;
7.    The strategy associated with the industrial pollution control components is of&#13;
reducing air pollution primarily and wastewater discharges secondarily. In project cities, up&#13;
to 70 percent of wastewater effluents are from industry discharged into a combined sewer&#13;
system or directly into lakes and rivers. The components were selected on the basis of&#13;
continued financial viability of the enterprise and the seriousness of air and water pollution&#13;
for which they are responsible. The relocation of two cement plant and the modemization&#13;
of a steel mill will do much to reduce ambient air quality pollutants such as particulate and&#13;
S02 in those respective cities. In addition, a pollution control fund will be established for&#13;
small industries and the TVIEs, which contribute a great share of both water and air&#13;
contaminants in the Province but which are difficult to control without such financial&#13;
means.&#13;

10.   Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, is one of the most famous historical and&#13;
cultural cities in China, and an important hub of communications and commerce.&#13;
Currently, the urban population of Wuhan is some 3,507,000, the population density is&#13;
4,091 person/km2 with a transient population of 800.000. With the widening of reform,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-108 -                     ANNEX7&#13;
Wuhan will continue to be a major center of industry, commerce, trade, finance,&#13;
communication, science, technology and information in Central China.&#13;
11.   Huangshi, the second major project city is located in the southeast of Hubei&#13;
Province, on1 south bank of the middle Yangtze River. It is the second largest city in the&#13;
Province. Currently, its urban population stands at 570,000, with a total population of&#13;
1,350,000 (including four districts and one county ). Following 40 years of construction,&#13;
a comprehensive industrial system is in place, which includes metallurgy, building&#13;
materials, machine, electricity, clothing, chemical engineering, textile, coal, medical,&#13;
food, light industry, electronics, etc.  With the development of industry, Huangshi&#13;
became an important center of commerce and inter-regional trade in Hubei, Jiangxi and&#13;
Anhui Provinces.&#13;
12.   Xiangfan is also a historical and cultural city with some 2,800 years of history. It&#13;
is an important communication hub with an urban population is 584,000.&#13;
13.   Yichang is an important industrial city located in the western section of Hubei&#13;
Province near Xilingkou of the Three fjord of Yangtze River. It is an important harbor&#13;
city on the line of demarcation of the upper and middle Yangtze River. In Yichang, the&#13;
number of municipal-owned and state-owned enterprises is 206, where the main&#13;
industries include chemical engineering, textiles, metallurgy, building materials,&#13;
electricity, paper and light industry, etc. Its current urban population is 380,000.&#13;
14.   Jingmen is an important communication hub in Hubei Province with advanced&#13;
communications. Additionally, the Han River that passes Jingmen city is rather ideal for&#13;
water transport. In the beginning of the 1970s, Jingmen oil refinery, Jingmen Power&#13;
Plant, and a Cement Plant were established. The current urban population is 165,600, in&#13;
which the nonagricultural population is 116,200.&#13;
15.   Ezhou is a developing city in southeast Hubei, located in middle of the Yangtze&#13;
River. It is an important component of the economic zone of the middle Yangtze River.&#13;
Ezhou City has 13 industrial departments predominated by metallurgy, building&#13;
materials, machine textile and food.&#13;
16.   Social and economic development, environmental improvements and upgrading&#13;
of quality of life are important symbols of the sustainable development in the economy in&#13;
Hubei Province.&#13;
Urban Wastewater Treatment Components&#13;
17.   Urban wastewater treatment components include establishment of wastewater&#13;
collection systems, pretreatment and primary treatment in Wuhan, Huangshi, and&#13;
Xiangfan. The main targets are to improve the drainage system of the three cities, to treat&#13;
the wastewater to a preliminary degree, improve the environmental situation of urban&#13;
natural waters and assist with recover of their various functions. Currently, wastewater&#13;
flows of the three cities are shown in Table 3 to part of which is flow.&#13;

I S.   In each of the cities, there are many sewage disposal points that are unknown and&#13;
therefore an exact accounting of flows is impossible. In East Lake in Wuhan, there are 11&#13;
discharge points. Streams in Xiangfan City have actually become wastewater channels.&#13;
19.   The capacity of urbani sewage treatment is almost nonexistent. Predominantly&#13;
sewage of the three cities drained directly to the environment without treatment. It causes&#13;
serious impact to waters such as eutrophication in important urban lakes, such as East&#13;
Lake, Moshui Lake and Ci Lake. In addition, most of these lakes have major sludge&#13;
layers at the bottom, which will make recovery much more difficult.  With the&#13;
development of urban society and economy, the amount of urban sewage will increase&#13;
year by year.&#13;
20.   The proposed sewage collection and treatment projects, according to the urban&#13;
construction and development plan, are components of a strategic planning approach of&#13;
the three cities and will play an important role in upgrading the sewage collection&#13;
treatment capacity of the three cities and improving urban environmental situation and&#13;
life quality.&#13;
21.   Wastewater Management Projects in Wuhan City. The Wuhan City urban&#13;
wastewater management project consists of wastewater collection system in East Lake&#13;
and three wastewater treatment plants in Erlangmiao, Shahu and Longwangzui; a&#13;
wastewater collection system and wastewater treatment plant in 'Western Hankou; the&#13;
wastewater collection system and wastewater treatment plant in Moshui Lake wastewater&#13;
discharge area in Hanyang Region. In addition, water exchange engineering in East Lake&#13;
of Wuchang and Moshui Lake of Hanyang is also included in the projects.&#13;
22.   The purposes of the components are as following: (a) to solve pollution problems&#13;
in East Lake to make the water quality meet the need for drinking, tourism, breeding and&#13;
cultivation, farm irrigation and entertainment and further to improve ecological&#13;
environment of the Lake area; (b) to add wastewater collecting systems in Western&#13;
Hankou in order to perfect urban service facilities, to reduce the existing threatening to&#13;
the public health and to improve environment in the region; (c) to restore water quality ill&#13;
East Lake in order to improve the drinking water quality for more than I million persons&#13;
in the region and to enhance the sustainable development of industry and tourism.&#13;

collection and treatment component in Xiangfan City consists of wastewater interception&#13;
engineering in Xiangcheng and wastewater interception engineering in Fancheng. The&#13;
project content is interception, collection of existing discharged wastewater and passing&#13;
the wastewater into wastewater pretreatment plant in Yuliang (the secondary treatment&#13;
plant in the future), and the treated wastewater will be sent into the lower reaches of the&#13;
Han River at Xiangfan. The aims are to reduce water pollution of urban areas and water&#13;
resource intake areas, to improve the city's overall scenery, to meet the need of public&#13;
health and comfort, to ensure long-term economic and social development and&#13;
sustainable environment while maintaining rapid industrial development in Xiangfan&#13;
City.&#13;
24.    Wastewater Collection and Treatment Component in Huangshi.  Ci Lake&#13;
water pollution management project in Huangshi City includes a wastewater pipe&#13;
network, collection systems and wastewater transporting systems built in the Ci lake area,&#13;
and a pretreatment system built in the Chenjiawan area. The aim of the project is to&#13;
protect the water quality in the Ci Lake, to improve the ecological environment and urban&#13;
facilities in Huangshi city and to raise citizens' life of quality.&#13;
Urban Wastes Management Projects&#13;
25.    Urban wastes management components include solid waste collection, equipment&#13;
and landfills in Wuhan, Huangshi, Xiangfan and Yichang cities.   With continued&#13;

26.      Currently, each city has some capacity to collect and dispose of garbage.  For&#13;
example, Wuhan has three landfills (with the treatment capacity of 2,225 tpd). Huangshi&#13;
has a landfill (with the treatment capacity of 100 to 120 tpd). Xiangfan has a simple&#13;
landfills and Yichang has a hygienic landfill (with the treatment capacity of 250 to&#13;
350 tpd). The main problems of solid waste management of the four cities are the&#13;
insufficient capacity  of collection, transport and  disposal.   The  current method  ot&#13;
collection, transfer and disposal and current practices cause severe impacts to the urban&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-112 -                       ANNEX7&#13;
environment, especially the uncontrolled piling at some temporary landfill or dispose&#13;
sites, and lack of strict quality control.&#13;
27.   The proposed solid waste management projects will increase capacity of&#13;
collection, transferring and disposal of urban solid wastes, to satisfy the requirements of&#13;
sound solid waste management in all four cities.&#13;
28.   Solid Waste Management Project in Wuhan. The solid waste management&#13;
project in Wuhan City consists of three parts: (a) to add 30 waste transport trucks; (b) to&#13;
build seven transfer stations; (c) to build Jinkou Waste Landfill deal with 2,000 tpd with&#13;
necessary accessories and facilities.&#13;

Industrial Pollution Control Components (IPC)&#13;
32.   There are six subprojects in the IPC component dealing with the industrial&#13;
wastewater treatment and air pollution control in plants and the relocation of heavy&#13;
polluting enterprises from urban areas to the planned industrial zones. Five of all the&#13;
plants selected in IPC Components (Echeng Iron-Steel Plant, ITubei Pharmacology Plant,&#13;
Jingmen Cement Plant, Yichang Cement Plant, Erxi Chemical Plant) are major polluting&#13;
enterprises in China, and on the list of state operated 3,000 heavy pollution enterprises by&#13;
NEPA. All of the six plants in IPC are state-owned.&#13;
33.   The Environmental Integrated Engineering Project in Echeng Iron and Steel.&#13;
Echeng Iron &amp; Steel Plant, located in central region of Ezhou City, is a combined iron&#13;
steel enterprise with mine, sintering, coking, iron-making, rolling and further processing.&#13;
Because of the crowded workshops and backyard equipment, the No. I steel mill does not&#13;
have adequate pollution control facilities for both emissions and wastewater discharges.&#13;
The industrial dust emission is more than 2,340 tons, accounts for 41 percent of industrial&#13;
dust emission, and 23 percent of industrial dust emissions in the central area of Ezhou&#13;
City. It is the main reason that the atmospheric quality in central region of Ezhou City is&#13;
higher than Class II state environmental standard.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-113 -                      ANNEX7&#13;
34.   The industrial wastewater of Echeng Iron-Steel Plant is 4,050 x 104 m3/year,&#13;
accounting for 93 percent of whole city in which 3195 x 1 03 m3 is drained to Yanglan&#13;
Lake, 75 x 103 m3 is directly drained into Yangtze River annually. The industrial water&#13;
utilization of Echeng Iron-Steel Plant is 1,212 x 104 m3/year. Part of the wastewater was&#13;
recycled without treatment. The wastewater discharges caused a serious impact on&#13;
surface water quality of the Yanglan Lake, the Xingang stream and the Yangtze River at&#13;
Ezhou.&#13;
35.   The proposed project includes two major parts:&#13;
(a)    Steel-making environmental project; three existing electric furnaces and&#13;
one existing turning furnace will be discarded, and a 80-ton super-high-&#13;
capacity electric furnace will be built connected to refining furnaces and&#13;
continuous casting machines. High efficient and stable smoke and dust&#13;
eliminating facilities, water treatment facilities and noise controlling&#13;
instrument will be built. In addition, a steel-slag automatic treatment&#13;
system  will be established, by which steel-slag in the whole plant&#13;
including the first plant will be changed into useful material, such as&#13;
construction material.&#13;
(b)   Industrial wastewater recycling: The cyanic-phenol wastewater produced&#13;
by the coking plant will be treated, and then discharged into the Yangtze&#13;
River though specific drainage pipelines.  In addition, a wastewater&#13;
treatment plant with a capacity of 25,000 t/h will be built with the&#13;
wastewater flowing into Mengu channel for recycling.&#13;
36.   The environmental management project for the No. 1 Steel mill is the first step of&#13;
implementation of a 10-year environment-protection plan in the Echeng Iron-Steel Plant.&#13;
The project will reduce 41 percent of the industrial dust and 14 percent of the wastewater.&#13;
The implementation of industrial wastewater recycling engineering will recycle&#13;
95 percent of the wastewater.&#13;
37.   Relocation of Jingmen Cement Plant. At the present time, Jingmen Cement&#13;
Plant with production capacity of 176,000 tons per year is located at central region of&#13;
Jingmen City, in an urban area of stores, schools and hospitals. The main environmental&#13;
problems is the discharge of industrial dust, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrous oxide (NOJ) and&#13;
carbon monoxide (CO). It significantly affects urban atmospheric quality, and the&#13;
health, life and work of local inhabitants. The plant not have enough pollution control&#13;
facilities with the limited area in the plant. The environmental monitoring data show that&#13;
the plant is the biggest dust source in the city. Because of size limits, relocation is the&#13;
best way to eliminate the pollution. According to Urban Environmental Strategies and&#13;
Plans of Jingmen City, the Jingmen Cement Plant will be moved from the urban area to&#13;
the construction material industry planning region outside the urban center.&#13;
38.   The proposed new project at the construction materials industrial zone will have a&#13;
cement clinker production line of 600 tpd capacity with the new dry production facility of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-114-                      ANNEX7&#13;
low-block 5-grade cyclone preheaters. All the production facilities in the urban area will&#13;
be removed, and the old factory site will be sold for use as commercial property. After&#13;
project implementation, the atmospheric quality in central urban area of Jingmen City&#13;
will be improved. With the relocation of Jingmen Cement Plant, advanced and reliable&#13;
dust collection equipment will be employed to reduce emissions.&#13;
39.   Hubei Pharmaceutical. Hubei Pharmnaceutical Plant, established in 1963, is a&#13;
national enterprise to producing medicines, preparations and medical equipment. The&#13;
existing wastewater drainage system of the plant is a combined system, and was set up in&#13;
1971. The wastewater of all workshops drains from west to east into a 700 m long&#13;
exposed ditch through the Jiaozhi channel via the unexposed ditch into the Han River.&#13;
The discharged contamination include conventional pollutants and some organic&#13;
pollutants such as nitrobenzene and nitrophenol. There is only a small wastewater&#13;
treatment plant with a capacity of 420 m3   day.&#13;
40.   The implement of this project will increase the wastewater treatment to&#13;
100 percent, and reduce greatly pollutants, especially organic. An industrial wastewater&#13;
treatment plant with capacity of 606 x 104 tons per year is proposed. Wastewater will be&#13;
treated with active sludge. Sludge will be dehydrated and solidified with gravity&#13;
concentrating and vacuum filtering.&#13;
41.   With the project, all of the wastewater will be treated. It is anticipated that COD&#13;
load and BOD5 load will be reduced per year by 2,900 tons and 1,800 tons, respectively.&#13;
The project will greatly contribute to improving the water environment in Xiangfan and&#13;
the lower reaches of the Han River.&#13;
42.   Relocation of Yichang Cement. At the present, the Yichang Cement Plant is&#13;
located in the east of Yichang City. It was established in 1958. The cement production is&#13;
220,000 tons/year. The major environmental issues are the emission of industrial dust,&#13;
S02, NO, and CO, which significantly affects urban air quality and health, and work of&#13;
the inhabitants.  The dust emission of the plant is approximately 2,601 tons/year,&#13;
accounting for 61 percent of dust emission in Yichang urban region.&#13;
43.   The project proposes to move the existing Yichang Cement Plant into the Huayan&#13;
Industrial Zone, which is 8 km east of its original site, and upgrade the cement plant with&#13;
a production line of 600 tons/year. Advanced 5-levels suspended preheater reverse kiln&#13;
technique with 95 percent reduction of dust emission is proposed. This project not only&#13;
reduces the emission of air pollutants, but also improves production quality. The existing&#13;
plant site will be changed into commercial use.&#13;
44.   Xiangfan Chemical. This plant was built in 1954 and is located in Fanxi&#13;
Industrial Zone, where its the main production is paratrisodium  phosphate.  The&#13;
wastewater is above-standard, reaching more than 1.0 million tons/year. The pollution&#13;
load of industrial wastewater takes fifth place among the biggest water polluting&#13;
enterprises of the city. The wastewater contains fluorine and high concentrations of&#13;
suspended matter passed to the Xiaoqing stream, and finally into Han River. The urban&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-115 -                     ANNEX7&#13;
part of 3 km long Xiaoqing stream has become a sewer containing waters from industrial&#13;
wastewater and domestic sewage in the Fancheng region.  Because of the serious&#13;
pollution of the Xiaoqing stream, the water quality of the Han River in Xiangfan became&#13;
worse and a long pollution band along the bank has formed. The wastewater treatment&#13;
plan of Xiangfan Chemical Plant is part of the effort to control pollution in Xiaoqing&#13;
River and protect the water quality of Han River.&#13;
45.   The emission of fluorine gas from the plant is more than 20 million Nm3 annually,&#13;
which is deposited in areas near the plant. It has had a great impact to life and health of&#13;
more than 20,000 residence and workers nearby.&#13;
46.   In the project, HF, SiF4 contained in waste gas will be absorbed with wave-wheel&#13;
washing method, and will be neutralized with sodium carbonate into sodium fluoride.&#13;
The waste gas will be exhausted to meet emission standards.&#13;
47.   Erxi Chemical.  Hubei Erxi Chemical Plant is a comprehensive chemical&#13;
enterprise, located 50 km from Xiangfan City. It is a key factory in the chemical sector&#13;
with main production of synthetic ammonia, ammonium nitrate, concentrated nitric acid,&#13;
high-purity methanol, formaldehyde, sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite, etc. The main&#13;
pollutants are nitric acid , NOx in air, and COD, suspended matters, ammonia, CN and&#13;
oils in water.&#13;
48.   The pollution control project of Erxi Chemical Plant is a combined clean&#13;
production with end-pipe treatment. The proposed pollution control components include&#13;
industrial wastewater treatment, charcoal recovery and waste gas treatment. Post-project,&#13;
charcoal can be recovered to 600 tons/year, nitrate can be recovered to 5,000 tons/year,&#13;
and SS will be reduced by 800 tons/year, COD 750 tons/year, amino-nitrogen 220 tons/&#13;
year, respectively.&#13;

Sixin port and Jiandi connection port, and the lake water can be discharged into the&#13;
Yangtze River through the Dongfeng Gate.&#13;
66.   Nanhu Lake is located in south of Wuchang District, with surface area of 5.9 km2.&#13;
It is connected with Xunsi River ( branch of Yangtze River ) through a branch channel to&#13;
the west of the lake. In winter, lake water is discharged by gravity into the River through&#13;
Wutai Gate, but in high-water period it shall be pumped into the River by Tangxun Lake&#13;
pump station. The main function of the lake is for storage adjustment and sewage&#13;
receiving.&#13;
2&#13;
67.   Ci Lake lies in the center of Huangshi City with water area of 8.15 km , congested&#13;
water area of 62.8 km2 and volume of 1,716 x 104 m3 . The reserving period of water is&#13;
200 days. Water will be discharged by gravity as water level of Yangtze River is lower&#13;
than that of Chi Lake and discharged by pump when contrary situation occurs.&#13;

Existing Environmental Quality&#13;
Water Quality&#13;
68.   According to water quality monitoring for the Yangtze River from 1986 to 1990,&#13;
the water quality of the Hubei reach of the main stream of the Yangtze River is good in&#13;
general, most monitoring indicators at all sections meeting with Class II standard of&#13;
surface water, with very low detection rate for volatile phenol, cyanide, arsenide, Cr6+,&#13;
pb and Cd, except that few items in some areas exceed the national standard.&#13;
69.   The Yangtze River at Wuhan. The reach should meet with Class 11 standards.&#13;
In the first two years, DO and NH3-N exceed the standards while in the later three years&#13;
organic phenol and colititer exceed the standards. The COD concentration is obviously&#13;
higher than that at the upper reaches while the concentration of all the pollutants at the&#13;
Gongyegang Section is higher than that at other three sections.&#13;
70.   The Yangtze River at Huangshi. The background section at Yangtze River&#13;
Gorges has a good water quality with the main pollutant of suspended solids. The water&#13;
quality at Xiseshan section is rather good except for the increasing concentration of&#13;
volatile phenol (still up to the standard). Affected by the urban sewage, the main&#13;
pollutants are suspended solid in the full and normal flow seasons and volatile phenol in&#13;
the dry flow seasons. Huajingtun section has the similar situation as Xiseshan section&#13;
with somewhat less volatile phenol pollution.&#13;
71.   The Han River at Xiangfan. As the second largest river in Hubei Province, the&#13;
Han River enters the Province from Shuhekou of Shanxi, flowing through Xunyang,&#13;
Xiangfan, Jingzhou and Xiaogan, and finally converges into the Yangtze River. The&#13;
average date of the 15 water quality indicators over five years meets with Class II&#13;
standards except that NH3-N is 0.16 times greater than the standard in the dry flow season&#13;
in 1986. The indicators that instantaneous values exceed the standards are NH3-N, NO2,&#13;
BOD5, COD, pH, SS and volatile phenol.&#13;
72.   Tributaries of the Han River. The Xiaoqinhe stream is the primary tributary of&#13;
the Han River, receiving large quantities of domestic and industrial wastewater, resulting&#13;
in serious water pollution. At some river reaches, the concentration of BOD5 exceeds&#13;
Class V of national surface water standard while COD, Mn, NH3-N and pH exceed Class&#13;
IV standards.&#13;
73.   The Huchenghe stream, surrounding the east, south and west of Xiangyang, is an&#13;
enclosed water-storage landscape water body. The sewage discharge has resulted in&#13;
serious eutrophication, with COD, BOD5, NH3-N, TP exceed the requirement of Class II&#13;
standard.&#13;
74.   The East Lake. Most of the lake area is of light pollution, exceeding Class III&#13;
national standards, with the major pollutants of TN, TP, BOD5, COD, SS, phenol and&#13;
coliform.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 120 -                    ANNEX7&#13;
75.   The Moshui Lake. The lake receive 2.6 x 107 m3 of domestic and industrial&#13;
wastewater, or 1.76 times of the rain runoff annually. The major pollutants in this&#13;
seriously polluted lake are COD, BOD5, TP and Pollutants in this seriously polluted lake&#13;
are COD, BOD5, TP and TN, exceeding Class V of national standard (GB 3838-88).&#13;
76.   The Ci Lake. Ci Lake has also a poor water quality with seriously-polluted area&#13;
of 2.3 kimn, accounting for 31 percent of the total water coverage. COD, TP and TN far&#13;
exceed the national standards, e.g., COD exceeds the standard 1.8-4.8 times, TP with 0.7-&#13;
14 times and TN with 2.4-73.2 times.&#13;
Air Quality&#13;
77.   Atmospheric environment monitoring network in Hubei province was set up in&#13;
1982. Up to 1990, 36 monitoring stations were introduced in the network and with total&#13;
number of 139 sampling points for atmospheric monitoring, 127 points for urban and 12&#13;
points as background. Main items to be monitored include SO2, NO, and TSP (Total&#13;
Suspended Particles). Table 6 is the results of monitoring atmospheric environment&#13;
quality in 1990 at six cities with which the project is concerned.&#13;

79.   As inferred from the tables, SO2 of Yichang, Huangshi and Ezhou have seriously&#13;
exceeded the standard, with daily average beyond the standard being 70 percent,&#13;
19.4 percent and 17 percent, respectively. Regarding NOx, daily average beyond the&#13;
standard in each city is less than 6 percent; it is very common that TSP has exceeded the&#13;
standard. Especially in four cities where industrial pollution control project is located,&#13;
the daily average beyond the standard is very high with high uniterm index.&#13;

Review of Alternatives&#13;
87.   In the selection of project components and sites, a complex process of review was&#13;
undertaken. First, a long list of components were proposed by municipal officials with&#13;
the aid of experts consultants. Some 68 components in the four project cities involving&#13;
wastewater were initially proposed, of which seven were finally selected. Cleanup of&#13;
East Lake in Wuhan was ranked as Number One because some 10 percent of the city's&#13;
water supply comes from this highly polluted source. Once projects were selected, a&#13;
review of alternatives required a least-cost approach, involving the least disruption, was&#13;
proposed.&#13;
88.   On the solid waste side, altematives involved a review of landfill sites and transfer&#13;
station sites based on financial resources available. Other disposal methods such as&#13;
incineration and composting were immediately rejected as being too uncertain in terms of&#13;
reliability and high costs. The only reliable disposal option is sanitary landfilling but the&#13;
question of picking a site can be complex. The sites selected (Jinkou in Wuhan for&#13;
example) were either already being used as a landfill or a dump, or have been studied for&#13;
some time by municipal authorities, design institutes and geotechnical consultants.&#13;
89.   The selected sites have to have several attributes; cheap land and of sufficient&#13;
scale; easily accessible for transport vehicles; away from communities; a stable and&#13;
predictable hydrology; adorable geotechnical characteristics such as an impervious&#13;
bottom layer; the availability of cover soil; and a suitable discharge point for the leachate.&#13;
Each of the project cities had only three or four candidate sites and the most favorable&#13;
was clearly evident.&#13;
90.   The issue of wastewater collection coupled with pretreatment was one that&#13;
required careful study. The concept as pointed out earlier was to clean up Yangtze&#13;
tributaries and urban lakes to the detriment of the Yangtze River itself. Again, reasons&#13;
for this included the massive scale of flow and the river's large assimilation capacity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-126 -                      ANNEX7&#13;
This capacity can be used in the short term to dispose of large quantities of urban&#13;
wastewater while urban lakes recover and funds are sought for primary and secondary&#13;
treatment.&#13;
91.   Review of alternatives of IPC components was done by the various technical&#13;
design institutes based on expected pollution control benefits, effluent and emission&#13;
standards and cost. For each IPC component several alternatives were proposed but&#13;
generally, the final decision was based on accepted practice in that industry. In the&#13;
modernization of industrial facilities whether a new electric arc furnace or a rotary kiln&#13;
for cement production, industry experts usually agree on a single approach.&#13;
92.   In the Hubei Urban Environment Project, the review of alternatives was a key step&#13;
in component selection as well as in determining how those components would be&#13;
implemented. Only sensible and proven approaches were suggested. An exceptionally&#13;
wide range of alternatives was rejected because tight funds cannot be squandered.&#13;
Environmental Management and Monitoring&#13;
93.   Management and monitoring of the proposed pollution control facilities will&#13;
require the full attention of local ESBs, EPBs and Provincial EPB. Each of the EIAs as&#13;
well as the component feasibility studies include detailed management and monitoring&#13;
plans. Provincial and national standards exist for emissions, ambient air quality, water&#13;
quality and wastewater discharges. These standards will be rigorously applied in every&#13;
case.&#13;
94.   In the case of sanitary landfills, sampling points must be established at wells,&#13;
treatment plant outfalls and at some distance from the facility for air quality monitoring.&#13;
Simple checks of COD, pH and BOD can be carried out on a frequent basis by landfill&#13;
staff with the assistance of the local EPBs. More complex monitoring and laboratory&#13;
analysis for heavy metals and other hard to detect pollutants a provincial laboratory&#13;
should be used. Data from these landfills should be routinely passed to the Provincial&#13;
ESB and EPB for final analysis.&#13;
95.   In the case of the wastewater components, it is vital that the water quality of the&#13;
lakes and rivers from which wastes have been diverted are carefully monitored to be sure&#13;
that there is no further deterioration. Clearly, water quality on receiving reaches of the&#13;
Yangtze should be frequently checked to be sure the either Class II or III be maintained.&#13;
Simple checks of BOD, COD, DO and pH should establish the basic condition of the&#13;
water body. This sampling and preliminary analysis can be carried out by local EPB&#13;
authorities but the data should also be made available to the Provincial EPB for final&#13;
analysis and to be able to track the project as a whole.&#13;
96.   For the IPC components, it will be up to both environmental staffs of the&#13;
enterprise and local EPBs to carry out sampling. Specifically they need to monitor TSP,&#13;
SO2, NO, and CO for compliance to standards. In the case of the Echeng Iron and Steel&#13;
&#13;

3.    The provincial program to close down or retool high-impact polluters requiring&#13;
special financial assistance is determined annually. In the first quarter of each year,&#13;
consultations among the provincial EPB, Planning Commission, Finance Bureau, and&#13;
other relevant agencies determines target enterprises. In 1994, these totaled 159 and in&#13;
1995, 92.&#13;
Research Program&#13;
4.    The planned research program includes four studies:&#13;
(a)   Survey  of Township  and  Village Enterprise  (TVE) Pollution&#13;
Discharges: The TVE industrial sector in rural areas is a rapidly growing&#13;
and increasingly important part of China's economy. In recent years in&#13;
Hubei, water and air pollution from TVEs represented about 2.2 and&#13;
11.7 percent, respectively, of the province's total pollution discharges.&#13;
Pollution from TVEs, while not large at this time, represents a growing&#13;
problem in the province, because most have no pollution control systems.&#13;
The proposed survey will assess all TVEs in Hubei. It will include&#13;
assessment of the existing economic situation of each enterprise,&#13;
production capacity, process technology, waste discharges, pollution&#13;
control and management. Some limited data collection will take place&#13;
where statistics are not already available. The future potential pollution&#13;
from TVEs.  Costs of treating emissions or substitution of cleaner&#13;
technology will be determined and a time-kt und :mplementation program&#13;
will be established. The Y 1.0 million survev is expected to start l!v tli&#13;
end of 1996 and be completed by mid- 1 998.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-134 -                      ANNEX II&#13;
(b)   Survey of Discharge Permit System Implementation: The pollution&#13;
control discharge  permit system, established  in  1989, is being&#13;
implemented in Hubei to reduce air and water pollution in the Province.&#13;
To date, about 1,500 industries have applied for a permnit, but only 150&#13;
have been issued.  The current implementation program  calls for&#13;
95 percent of the industries to be issued permits by the year 2000. This&#13;
study/program will serve to promote the pollution control permit system&#13;
among industries in Hubei.  It will stress the importance of its&#13;
implementation and enforcement, and ensure the collection of the total&#13;
levies determined to be assessable. The Y 500,000 survey is expected to&#13;
commence in mid-1996 and is to be completed by mid-1997.&#13;
(c)    Study of Pollution Control of Fertilizer Industry in Hubei: There are&#13;
about 64 nitrogenous and 40 phosphatic fertilizer plants of varying sizes in&#13;
Hubei, producing about 900,000 and 550,000 tons, respectively, per year.&#13;
Air pollution emissions from fertilizer plants represent about 25 percent of&#13;
the total air pollution in urban areas. The proposed study will: (i) assess&#13;
the existing production and water/air pollution situation for fertilizer plants&#13;
in Hubei; (ii) determine the impact of anticipated future paper production&#13;
capacity; (iii) determine pollution control and technology choice that will&#13;
bring the industry into compliance with environmental standards;&#13;
(iv) estimate the cost of the interventions and (v) set out a multiyear&#13;
program to implement the proposed systems. Estimated cost of the study&#13;
is Y 500,000. It is expected to commence by the end of 1996 and be&#13;
completed by the end of 1997.&#13;
(d)   Study of Pollution Control of Pulp and Paper Industry in Hubei:&#13;
There are 327 paper mills in lIubei, producing about 500,000 tons per&#13;
year, which places Hubei thirteenth in production capacity in China. Only&#13;
about 12 percent of the wastewater discharges is treated to standards, and&#13;
the remainder is discharged, untreated, to watercourses. The proposed&#13;
study will:  (i) assess the existing production and water/air pollution&#13;
situation for paper mills in Hubei; (ii) determine the impact of anticipated&#13;
future paper production capacity; (iii) determine pollution control and&#13;
technology choice that will bring the industry into compliance with&#13;
environmental standards; (iv) estimate the cost of the interventions and&#13;
(v) set out a multiyear program to implement the proposed systems.&#13;
Estimated cost of the study is Y 600,000. It is expected to commence by&#13;
mid- 1996 and be completed by mid- 1997.&#13;
5.    The research program serves several purposes. The TVE study will help EPB&#13;
assess the impact of TVE pollution and adequacy of EPB regulations. Based onI the&#13;
study, the provincial EPB will seek any needed regulatory changes. The discharge permnit&#13;
study evaluates EPB's most important policv change over the life of the project, and will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

highlight needed adjustments in the policy. The industry pollution control studies will be&#13;
implemented in part through HEPCF financing.&#13;
Training Program&#13;
6.    The training program of the EIAP includes for training at provincial, national and&#13;
international levels. It is expected that about 1,000 environmental staff and officials per&#13;
year would be involved in some form of training under the EIAP. The total cost of the&#13;
training program is estimated to be Y 808,000. The areas of training are indicated below:&#13;

ANNEX 12: HUBEI ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION&#13;
CONTROL FUND&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    China is taking a variety of measures to bring municipal and industrial pollution&#13;
under control. One method, addressed to industries, is to create revolving loan funds at the&#13;
provincial or municipal level that provide financing for the control of liquid, solid and&#13;
gaseous wastes, particularly to those with the greatest environrnental impact. A regulatory&#13;
framework wherein industries are required to meet specified waste discharge standards and&#13;
an institutional structure to organize and operate the funds are prerequisite to their success.&#13;
Almost 4,000 people are engaged in pollution control activities in the province.&#13;
2.    In 1982, Chinese environmental law provided for the establishment of provincial.&#13;
municipal, and county environmental funds financed by pollution fees. These originally&#13;
provided subsidies and grants for pollution reduction investments in industrial and&#13;
municipal pollution reduction projects, and for EPB environmental monitoring and&#13;
enforcement. In 1988, an amendment allowed up to 30 percent of the fees to be loaned.&#13;
rather than granted, to enterprises.  Bank projects in Tianjin, Jiangsu, Liaoning and&#13;
Zhejiang, and the Medium-Sized Cities project, have supported improved environmental&#13;
fund project identification and management.&#13;
Pollution Fee Collection and Use in Hubei Province&#13;
3.    In Hubei, municipal and county EPBs collect pollution fees, while the provincial,&#13;
municipal and county EPBs jointly plan fee collection and utilization. According to a fund&#13;
allocation plan provided by the EPBs, the local finance bureaus issue orders and extend&#13;
funds to subprovincial level PCBCs for loan disbursement.&#13;
4.    Fees are assessed according to waste discharge information provided to levy offices&#13;
by the local monitoring stations. On the average, large polluting industries should be&#13;
monitored monthly. However, due to lack of monitoring resources, some industries receive&#13;
their fee bill according to waste discharge load estimates by monitoring stations. In Hubei.&#13;
the top individual polluters remain the steel industry, cement and chemicals.&#13;
5.    Fee rates have been established for wastewater discharges, waste gas emissions,&#13;
solid waste dumping and noise pollution. Between 1985 and 1993, total fee collection&#13;
amounts to Y 583 million from 5,640 enterprises. Of the collected fees, about 71 percent&#13;
were used for industrial pollution control, 4 percent for nonindustrial environmental&#13;
improvement projects and 25 percent for EPBs' environmental monitoring and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-137-                       ANNEX 12&#13;
eniorcement. During 1985 to 1993, about 7,800 industrial pollution control projects were&#13;
supported by pollution fee funds, totaling about Y 1.2 billion, of which 24 percent came&#13;
froii El'13 sources. In 1993 alone, some 209 pollution sources were treated. Pollution fees&#13;
for indtustrial pollution control clearly played an important role in Hubei.&#13;
6.    Bank Experience in China with Environmental Funds. The Bank has supported&#13;
the establishment of environmental funds under five different projects and four of them&#13;
have been in operation for at least one year. The Bank-assisted funds were found to have&#13;
the following advantages over other funds:&#13;
(a)   they provide a stronger framework for management, including organization,&#13;
staffing and operation regulations, and, indirectly, provide the basis for other&#13;
environmental protection management measures including the permit&#13;
system and the promotion of pollution prevention programs;&#13;
(b)   institute rigorous requirements and procedures for project preparation and&#13;
appraisal ensuring a higher project success rate; and&#13;
(c)   provide training for capacity-building to staff of the fund offices in the&#13;
technical and financial areas.&#13;
7.    On the other hand, appraisal procedures have been expensive compared to the size&#13;
of the typical loan, which has been under $1.0 million. Due regard needs to be given to&#13;
modifications of the appraisal procedures to bring down costs while maintaining quality.&#13;
The Hubei Environmental Pollution Control Fund (HEPCF)&#13;
8.    The purpose of establishing HEPCF is to strengthen the existing Hubei pollution&#13;
prevention program with a technically, institutionally and financially sustainable&#13;
mechanism. The Fund would primarily assist small-scale industrial enterprises to control&#13;
pollution through waste minimization measures, modifications or renovations to existing&#13;
plants to reduce waste outputs or to recycle waste generated during production. Industrial&#13;
upgrading projects designed to reduce the amount of pollutant discharge and to save natural&#13;
resources and energy, commercial waste recovery services and centralized treatment plants&#13;
would also be considered by the Fund. Some 300 small, polluting enterprises that have&#13;
been identified as contributing significantly to the provincial pollution load will receive&#13;
preferential access to HEPCF.&#13;
9.    Organization and Financing of HEPCF. HEPCF would be a self accounting&#13;
governrment entity. with initial capital equivalent of Y 87 million. The Bank Loan/ IDA&#13;
Credit would provide $5.0 million and HEPB would contribute an equivalent sum from&#13;
industrial pollution discharge fees (no less than Y 15.0 million for each of the first three&#13;
years). While the size of the Bank/IDA contribution has been kept small ($5 million), the&#13;
justification for Bank/IDA support for the fund derives from first, the advantages listed in&#13;
paragraphi 6(a) above, second, the elevation of flubei's existing pollution prevention&#13;
program into an internationally supported one, supplemented by focused training to further&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 138-                      ANNEX 12&#13;
improve environmental management, and third, the confidence building and institutional&#13;
strengthening expected to accrue to HEPB.&#13;
10.   HPG has designated HEPB to administer HEPCF. HPG would appoint a steering&#13;
committee which would oversee the preparation of an operational manual, setting out the&#13;
criteria for subloans processing and approvals. The Steering Committee would propose&#13;
policies for application for HEPCF funding, formulate rules and regulations for Fund&#13;
management, select a depository agency for the Fund and define the terms and conditions&#13;
for Fund loans. The HEPCF Steering Committee would also determine institutional&#13;
structure and staff composition of the HEPCF Management Office and approve its annual&#13;
work plan and budget.&#13;
11.   The Fund Management Office (FMO) would have up to 12 staff, to be recruited&#13;
over a three-year period, including specialists in environmental science and technology,&#13;
industrial processing, economics and finance, and administration. The director would be&#13;
appointed by the Steering Committee, and other staff would be locally recruited. The main&#13;
role of FMO would be in investment project planning, coordination between borrower and&#13;
agent bank, review of project feasibility and supervision of project implementation.&#13;
Financial appraisal will be handled within FMO, while technical appraisal will rely on&#13;
consultants for industry-specific expertise.&#13;
12.   Project Selection. Each application would have to be reviewed by the local&#13;
industrial bureau and planning commission, and approved by the concerned local&#13;
Environmental Protection Bureau, to ensure consistency with municipal environmental&#13;
planning. Based on the general project selection criteria mentioned above, a formula for&#13;
ranking would be developed to prioritize submitted project proposals.&#13;
Project Management Procedures&#13;
13.   HEPCF operating procedures would be drafted and would be approved by the&#13;
HEPCF Steering Committee. Fundamental project management procedures would be:&#13;
(a)   The Fund Management Office would issue HEPCF directives and&#13;
solicitations for project proposals to the sublevel provincial environmental&#13;
protection agencies and planning agencies;&#13;
(b)   With consent from the local industrial bureau, the enterprise would submit a&#13;
loan application to the environmental protection agency and planning&#13;
agency of its location;&#13;
(c)   The environmental protection agency and planning agency would review the&#13;
application for consistency with local development and environmental plans;&#13;
(d)   The enterprise would prepare a feasibility study report, including a financial&#13;
proposal for investment and an environmental impact assessment;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-139-                       ANNEX12&#13;
(e)   After the project has been appraised, FMO would submit the appraisal report&#13;
to the World Bank Group for no-objection, along with proposed loan&#13;
conditions. The Bank/IDA would provide ex-ante review of the first three&#13;
subloan projects and thereafter each subloan of over $300,000, with all other&#13;
subloans subject to ex-post review.&#13;
(f)   The HEPCFF Steering Committee would be responsible for the final&#13;
approval of subloan projects. After approval, FMO would confirm the loan&#13;
to the enterprise, any cofinancing agencies and the agent bank;&#13;
(g)   FMO would supervise the implementation of the project;&#13;
(h)   After satisfying itself as to the quality of a commissioned project, the&#13;
relevant bureau would issue a Certificate of Examination and Acceptance to&#13;
the enterprise;&#13;
(i)    The bureau in charge would submit examination and acceptance documents&#13;
for the project to FMO;&#13;
(j)   FMO  would separately assess whether the project meets the design&#13;
document requirements. If it does not, FMO would arrange for appropriate&#13;
departments to intervene, seeking necessary amendments to the project.&#13;
Project Appraisal&#13;
14.   For the technical appraisal of individual projects, the general criteria to be&#13;
considered are: (a) the project's impact on the ambient environment; (b) investment and&#13;
operating cost per unit pollution load reduction; (c) efforts made on pollution prevention;&#13;
(d) compliance with environmental regulations and standards; and (e) technical feasibilitv&#13;
and least-cost option.&#13;
15.   The economic appraisal for investment of the individual enterprise must show the&#13;
enterprise is economically viable.&#13;
16.   For the financial appraisal of the subproject, each enterprise would have to show&#13;
that it, as a whole, would be financially viable, including meeting a debt service ratio larger&#13;
than 1.4. For joint waste treatment facilities, a financing plan for the operation and&#13;
maintenance of the facility would be required.&#13;
Project Financing Procedures Between Agent Bank and Borrower&#13;
17.   The agent would be a bank acceptable to the World Bank. Once a subloan&#13;
application is approved by HEPCF, the agent would execute the loan according to&#13;
procedures described below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-140-                      ANNEX 12&#13;
(a)   The agent would confirm the project financing plan with the borrower, in&#13;
accordance with the loan agreement signed between HEPCF and the&#13;
enterprise.&#13;
(b)   The project unit would open an account with the agent.&#13;
(c)   The agent would disburse funds upon receipt of a statement of expenditure,&#13;
in the form of invoice or letter of credit. Normally, disbursement would be&#13;
made once a month.&#13;
(d)   The agent would supervise the fund's use by the project unit. If project&#13;
funds are found to have been used for any purpose other than the approved&#13;
project, the agent would refuse further disbursement and notify the FMO.&#13;
(e)   The agent would report to HEPCF quarterly on the financial status of loans&#13;
made to borrowers. The agent would also report emerging issues and make&#13;
suggestions for improvement as needed.&#13;
(f)    At project completion the agent would finalize the financial accounting.&#13;
(g)   If projects fail to meet project date or design criteria, the agent shall notify&#13;
FMO.&#13;
(h)   The agent would assist HEPCF in the collection of loan principal, interest,&#13;
late payment penalties and fines.&#13;
18.   Disbursement would be made through the agent from the special account for&#13;
HEPCF in the Hubei Finance Bureau. The Fund would be audited annually, to include a&#13;
management letter.&#13;
Loans&#13;
19.   The HEPCF loan for any project would be limited to 100 percent of foreign&#13;
exchange costs, or 50 percent of total project costs (excluding land), whichever is higher.&#13;
Total project size would normally not exceed $1 million. Loan maturity would be three to&#13;
five years, with up to two years' grace. HEPCF would bear the subloan credit risk and the&#13;
enterprise the foreign exchange risk. The subloan interest rate would be no less than the&#13;
IBRD standard variable rate plus a spread of 1.5 percent, with a commitment charge of&#13;
0.75 percent. Repayments to HEPCF would be recycled for additional subprojects to the&#13;
extent funds are not needed for repayment of the World Bank loan.&#13;
HEPCF Project Pipeline&#13;
20.   A tentative subloan project pipeline has been prepared by HEPB (see HUEPO&#13;
Feasibility Study for details).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-141-                       ANNEX 12&#13;
Institutional Development and Equipment Needs&#13;
21.   The Fund Management Office personnel would undergo an extensive training&#13;
program.  Training courses would include economic and financial analysis, waste&#13;
management, waste reduction technology, particularly resource recovery/recycling and&#13;
clean technology. Training and equipment for HEPCF will be partially financed under&#13;
Package C of the technical assistance schedule.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

-142 -                      ANNEX 13&#13;
ANNEX 13: FINANCIAL ANALYSIS ASSUMPTIONS&#13;
WASTEWATER AGENCIES&#13;
1.    Assumptions to the projections of the main financial statements of the Huangshi,&#13;
Wuhan and Xiangfan Wastewater agencies for the period 1995-2002 are provided below.&#13;
2.    Inflation and Exchange Rates. Yearly general domestic inflation rates used in the&#13;
projections are 14.0 percent for 1995, 10.6 percent in 1996, 8.5 percent in 1997, 7.0 percent&#13;
in 1998, 6.5 percent in 1999 and 6.2 percent in 2000-02. Foreign price increases are&#13;
estimated at 2.6 percent for each of years 1995-2002. The exchange rate used to convert&#13;
foreign costs to local currency, where applicable, was Y 8.4 per $1.0. It is assumed that&#13;
exchange rate adjustments would, on average, maintain purchasing power parity over the&#13;
projection period.&#13;
Income Statement&#13;
3.    Sales. Projections of sewerage quantities are based on "minimum demand" and&#13;
maximum capacity figures, and at the equivalent of 80 percent of water bills.&#13;
4.    Average Tariffs. The average prices in Yuan per m  in current terms are as&#13;
follows:&#13;
1996    1997    1998    1999    2000    2001    2002&#13;
Huangshi      0.18    0.20    0.22    0.24    0.26    0.31    0.32&#13;
Wuhan         0.18    0.20    0.22    0.24    0.26    0.28    0.30&#13;
Xiangfan      0.18    0.20    0.22    0.24    0.26    0.36    0.36&#13;
5.    Operating Costs. Salaries, wages and staff benefits are assumed to increase at the&#13;
rates given in para. 2 above. Personnel numbers are assumed to increase by 5 percent a year&#13;
after project flows commence. Energy, materials and other costs are assumed to increase in&#13;
line with general inflation also. For both existing assets and assets to be constructed under&#13;
the project, 1.2 percent of their value is assumed to be expended repairs and maintenance.&#13;
Composite depreciation rates have been used to depreciate assets on the basis of historical&#13;
cost. The following rates have been used: Huangshi-4.3 percent; Wuhan-4.5 percent;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-143 -                       ANNEX 13&#13;
and Xiangfan-3.2 percent The agencies have been exempted from paying business and&#13;
income taxes.&#13;
6.    Interest and Amortization Expenses. The proceeds of the IBRD loan/IDA credit&#13;
are assumed to be onlent to the Huangshi, Wuhan and Xiangfan wastewater agencies by&#13;
their respective Municipal Govemments at the IBRD's standard variable interest rate&#13;
(which was 7.07 percent per year at the time of negotiations), and 0.75 percent per year&#13;
commitment charge over 15 years, including 5 years of grace. Interest is paid annually.&#13;
Amortization of loans would be on the basis of equal payments of principal. The&#13;
wastewater agencies would bear the foreign exchange risk. The municipalities would&#13;
provide the local capital counterpart funds as capital grants.&#13;
Balance Sheet&#13;
7.    Inventories.  Inventories are assumed to be four months of chemicals and&#13;
maintenance materials, and have been projected to take into account general inflation as&#13;
well as any expanded levels of operations and construction.&#13;
8.    Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are assumed to be 60 days of billings&#13;
from 1996.&#13;
9.    Bad Debts. Bad debts are assumed to be 0.5 percent of billings.&#13;
10.   Accounts Payable. Accounts payable are assumed to be two months of chemicals,&#13;
utilities and maintenance materials from 1996.&#13;
Source and Application of Funds&#13;
11.   Working Capital Needs. Working capital needs represent the excess, or otherwise,&#13;
of the current year's current assets (net of cash), less the excess of the previous year's&#13;
current assets (net of cash) over current liabilities.&#13;
12.   Change in Cash.  Change in cash (which includes short-term  investments)&#13;
calculates the balance sheet cash balance for the current year.&#13;

ANNEX 14: ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL&#13;
CONSIDERATIONS&#13;
A. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
1.    The Bank Group highlighted enhancing environmental protection and alleviating&#13;
infrastructure bottlenecks as two of the four areas of concentration under the China Country&#13;
A\ssistance Strategy (CAS) presented to the Board in June 1995. The Bank Group's close&#13;
collaboration witlh the Chinese government covers both the regulatory and service provision&#13;
aspects of urban environmental maniagement. The China. Environmental Strategy Paper&#13;
sector study led to an Environmental 'Technical Assistance Project that assists NEPA in its&#13;
ef'forts to find more efficient regulatory methods, improve staff capabilities, and bolster&#13;
enivironimental monitoring. In addition to national regulatory assistance, the Bank Group is&#13;
currently involved in tive urban environmental projects in eight cities, which incorporate&#13;
policy, financing and organizational strategies for improved environmental regulation and&#13;
service delivery at the provincial and municipal levels. Another four ongoing investment&#13;
projects involving 12 cities include related issues such as municipal water supply and&#13;
sanitation needs. The initial round of projects focused on China's largest cities-Shanghai.&#13;
Beijing, and Tianjin-and those located primarily in the wealthier northeast and coastal&#13;
provinces. Environmental pressures remain very high in those areas and cooperation will&#13;
continue, as with the recently appraised Second Shanghai Sewerage Project and the&#13;
Shiandong Environmenit Project IIow being prepared. However, the proposed Hubei Urban&#13;
Environmental l'roject marks a shift in geographic focus, moving toward inland and poorer&#13;
areas. I lubei, a mieedium-income province, is located in central China, wvhile projects now&#13;
hbing prepared in thle very poor Yunnan and Guangxi provinces will further test the&#13;
t'easibility of policy and institutional solutions.&#13;
2.   3Ban;kwide municipal management sector work (Urban Service Delivery: Finding&#13;
the Right Incentives) emphasizes the need to properly assign functional responsibilities&#13;
and link revenue to expenditures.  In China's case, environmental services are&#13;
appropriately provided at the municipal level, where a high percentage of government&#13;
reventue is also captured. China: Urhan Environmental .Service Management concludes&#13;
that the major failing in environmental services has been dependence on municipal&#13;
budget transfers to fund services, while greater reliance on user charges would be&#13;
af'fordable, induce resource conservation, and create a more dependable income stream.&#13;
For that reason, increasing tariffs has been a major focal point of the policy dialogue in&#13;
this project. This responds, too, to a major finding in the OED review of Bank water and&#13;
sanitation projects (Water Supply and Sanitation Projects: The Bank Experience 1967-&#13;
1'089), wherein physical performance was generally good, but sustaining financial&#13;
&#13;

viability and overall sectoral development was less successful. Adequate sector revenues&#13;
have been so crucial to successful operation of these investments that the Bank now sees the&#13;
needed tariff structures as the major sign of municipal commitment and therefore asks for&#13;
initial adjustments to be made during project processing. The proposed project follows this&#13;
model.&#13;
3.    This project thus responds to Bank sector work and sector experience, and CAS&#13;
objectives, first through an improved regulatory environment, reduction of current pollution&#13;
loads, and protection of critical water and land resources and second through&#13;
commercialization of operating agencies, and improved tariff policy and operating&#13;
techniques. The Bank's strategy flows from and supports China's Environmental Action&#13;
Plan and Agenda 21, which provide the basis for joint Government and Bank action in the&#13;
environmental sector, especially in regard to the urban environment. Finally, the provincial&#13;
focus recognizes the effective decentralization of regulatory and investment authority in&#13;
China, and draws on local political power and commitment to induce wider use of the&#13;
solutions demonstrated under the project.&#13;
4.    The project supports provincial efforts to substantially reduce pollution within the&#13;
province, especially within densely populated urban areas, by providing new models for the&#13;
efficient organization and financing of urban environmental services and financing for&#13;
wastewater and solid waste handing and treatment, and for industrial pollution control.&#13;
Specifically, the project would support:&#13;
(a)   the more aggressive use of user fees to shift the burden of pollution&#13;
abatement to the polluter and induce waste minimization and new&#13;
organizational forms for wastewater providers, to allow improved&#13;
management tools and to help minimize the cost of abatement;&#13;
(b)   the provincial and municipal EPBs in their efforts to implement more&#13;
effective regulatory instruments;&#13;
(c)   expansion of sewerage services, hence a reduction in water pollution, within&#13;
the boundaries of Wuhan, Xiangfan, and Huangshi, thus protecting the&#13;
urban environment and the health of their people;&#13;
(d)   the first municipal solid waste landfills meeting national standards in the&#13;
cities of Xiangfan and Yichang, and major capacity expansion in Huangshi&#13;
and Wuhan, with consequent protection of local land and water resources&#13;
and flaring of landfill methane to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and&#13;
(e)   a line of credit to allow abatement of important industrial point sources of&#13;
pollution affecting large urban populations and a pollution control revolving&#13;
fund to provide a model for such funds.&#13;

B. ECONONlic ANALYSIS&#13;
5.    From  an economics perspective, project formulation-within the constraint of&#13;
developing an urban environment project-presented the major analytical challenge of&#13;
allocating investment support across a potentially wide array of cities and sectors. Ideally,&#13;
that allocation would maximize net present value, fully incorporating environmental&#13;
externalities, within the project area. Yet, current methodologies do not allow quick or&#13;
inexpensive, yet high confidence. estimates of the impact of interventions across such a&#13;
broad choice set. Instead, a different macro allocation criterion was used, based on the fact&#13;
that what was known with high confidence was that current policy and institutional&#13;
structures needed substantial change if sustainable environmental protection was to be&#13;
aclieved.  Policy problems included urbani environmental services priced too low to&#13;
discourage waste generation or provide the financing needed to build, maintain, and operate&#13;
services suclh as wastewater collection and treatment. Government bureaus providing the&#13;
services lacked the financial tools to develop effective tariff strategies or the operating&#13;
autonomny needed to encourage managerial iimovation. Gaps in environmental regulation&#13;
Vwcr: allso apparent. Therefore, choices about participating sectors and cities were made&#13;
vith a view toward maximizing the impact of policy aned inistitutional innovation within the&#13;
province. Specific investment choices within sectors and cities responded to municipal&#13;
government strategies to bring ambient environmental quality or service standards up to&#13;
national guidelines. For the latter, analyvsis sought the least cost option for meeting the&#13;
guidelines. The detailed calculations can be found in the project files. Highlights of the&#13;
analysis are given below.&#13;
C ity And Sector Choices&#13;
6.     I lubei Province has developed environmental improvement plans with annual, five&#13;
year, and ten year horizons. These plans include upgraded urban environmental services in&#13;
all of flubei's 30 cities and a focus on the 117 most highly polluting enterprises, most of&#13;
wvhich are within city administrative boundaries. In urban environmental services, the plans&#13;
higlhlight the relative lack of sewerage services within urbani areas-household and&#13;
industrial wastewater typically discharges to creeks, rivers, and lakes rather than to sewer&#13;
systems-and the virtual absence of sanitary landfills or other safe disposal for solid waste&#13;
and nightsoil.  Enterprise pollution abatement strategies locus on process change,&#13;
siometimes accompanied by physical relocation of the enterprise.&#13;
7.    In urban environmental service provision, cities were included in the project based&#13;
on the size of the population potentially benefiting from improved services and considering&#13;
their value as models to other provincial cities. After reviewing potential investments in&#13;
some nine provincial cities, the four largest cities were selected for further project&#13;
development. Each of those cities had already prepared environmental improvement plans&#13;
that outlined priority service improvements, both in terms of the type of service and areas of&#13;
the city needing service. With the project, each city established a council headed by a vice-&#13;
mayor, with members from the environmental protection, urban services, plamning, and&#13;
financial bureaus, to review existing plans and guide any decisions needed on scope or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 159 -                       ANNEX 14&#13;
administrative arrangements. Work with Bank missions colnfirmed the choice to extend&#13;
sewerage systems and build or substantially expand sanitary landfills.&#13;
8.    The Hubei strategy for industrial pollution control builds on national and provincial&#13;
emissions control law and regulations. However, the current concentration-based emissions&#13;
controls can produce the perverse results that even if all enterprises comply, high ambient&#13;
pollution levels can result where receiving body volume is low compared to effluent&#13;
volumes, or, when receiving body volumes and other characteristics create very high&#13;
assimilative capacity compared to loads, enterprises will spend an excessive amount on&#13;
pollution control. In response, the province is moving to a mass-based permit system, the&#13;
implementation of which is an element of the Environmental Improvement Action Plan in&#13;
this project.&#13;
9.    For enterprises built before polluting effluents were regulated, cash flow alone&#13;
rarely meets the financing needs of process changes or end-of-pipe treatment that will&#13;
allow compliance with current effluent standards. Pollution abatement investments must&#13;
compete in China's plan-driven credit market with investments typically offering much&#13;
higher financial returns to sponsors. Where banks are able to make loans outside of state-&#13;
dictated  credit plans, they  seek  high  and  rapid  returli opportunities, a feature&#13;
uncharacteristic of pollution-abatement investments. Credit market constraints [described&#13;
much more fully in the China Department's 1995 Capital Markets Sector Study (No.&#13;
14501-CHA)] do leave a large number of abatement opportunities in economically and&#13;
financially viable enterprises that currently have a high pollution impact on large&#13;
populations.  Hubei Province therefore sought to use part of the loan to fund such&#13;
investments.  The Province agreed with the Bank on a selection process to identify&#13;
enterprise pollution abatement programs that would have a high positive impact on urban&#13;
populations and provide them access to a line-of-credit to finance the interventions. This&#13;
line-of-credit activity is discussed more fully below.&#13;
10.   The potential Bank loan for the municipal service and enterprise pollution control&#13;
activities was far below the absorptive capacity of the province. Either urban environmental&#13;
services or the industrial pollution control component could have absorbed the entire loan&#13;
earmnarked for the province bv the State Planning Commission.  Given that urban&#13;
environmental problems could be successfully addressed only by a combination of urban&#13;
servize and industrial pollution control measures, and that the high visibility of Bank-&#13;
financed operations was thought important to providing model approaches to outstanding&#13;
prob:ems, the HPG and Bank agreed that both types of activities should be incorporated&#13;
into :he loan. The allocation of the loan between the two types of activities, approximately&#13;
two ihirds to municipal services and one third to industrial pollution control, resulted from a&#13;
shared judgment about the balance that would produce maximum impact within the&#13;
province. Decisions about resource allocation within sectors and cities are detailed below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-160 -                        ANNEX 14&#13;
Wastewater Collection and Treatment&#13;
11.   Wuhan. Currently, some 60 percent of the 1.8 million m3 average daily wastewater&#13;
flows within the city of Wuhan discharge to sewers. In Wuchang district, a wastewater&#13;
treatment plant with 50,000 m3 daily capacity was recently commissioned, but a lack of&#13;
operating funds idles the plant for several months each year. Unsewered wastewater&#13;
discharges to lakes, canals, and rivers within the municipality, all of which eventually&#13;
discharge to the Yangtze. The quality of these surface waters has deteriorated rapidly in&#13;
recent years, with that in the largest lake, East Lake (see Map 27250), now Class IV' in&#13;
many areas and experiencing heavy eutrophication, Moshui Lake well below Class V,&#13;
Nanhu Lake with BOD5 and cyanide over Class V standard and Nantaizi Lake plagued by&#13;
eutrophication. Most smaller canals and rivers fail to meet Class V, although the Fu river&#13;
does meet Class IV. Nonetheless, East Lake has been a major raw water source for&#13;
domestic use in Wuchang district, with installed capacity equal to 10 percent of all Wuhan&#13;
municipal supply, and its waters are used for irrigation, commercial and recreational&#13;
fishing, other recreation, and industrial supply. Nanhu Lake serves the same functions with&#13;
the exception of domestic potable water supply. Moshui has been lost to use except as a&#13;
waste sink.&#13;
12.   The Yangtze and Han Rivers split Wuhan into three large districts, all of which lack&#13;
adequate sewering and wastewater treatment. To facilitate the introduction of institutional&#13;
and tariff reforms throughout the city, the Wuhan municipal government sought to include&#13;
Bank-supported work in each of the three districts.  Investment priority, based on&#13;
anticipated impact on water quality and the associated population, was first diversion of&#13;
wastewater from East Lake in the Wuchang district; second capture of flows in west&#13;
Hankou district, with discharge to the Fu River; and third, diversion of wastewater from&#13;
Nantaizi Lake and Moshui Lake in Hanyang district, with preliminary treatment and&#13;
discharge to the Yangtze.&#13;
13.   Direct economic losses to East Lake pollution include those of water supply losses&#13;
(averaging an additional Y 20 million/year as the cost of replacing East Lake supply with&#13;
that from the Yangtze), additional health costs and lost recreational and development&#13;
potential. The latter two costs are more difficult to evaluate than additional water supply&#13;
costs, but Wuhan research institutes have attached estimated values of Y 21 million and&#13;
Y 12 million annually to these losses. At a 12 percent discount rate, that represents a net&#13;
present value of Y 401 million to the pollution damage, assuming that the worsening water&#13;
quality would not cause further real increases in costs. The cheapest remedy for these&#13;
losses would be to capture the wastewater flows and discharge them without treatment to&#13;
the Yangtze, with its higher assimilative capacity. Investment costs for this approach would&#13;
total about Y 300 million. However, such discharges to the Yangtze are no longer&#13;
The water quality classification system: Classes I and I: high quality suitable for drinking water&#13;
source; Class Ill: usable for drinking water after treatment; Class IV: boating, fishing, industrial water&#13;
supply; Class V: irrigation and industrial cooling.&#13;

permitted by the central govermment, in an attempt to preserve Yangtze quality at its current&#13;
Class II level. The alternative selected, of expanding existing tertiary and secondary sewers&#13;
on the western side of East Lake (see Map 27250) and expanding the existing wastewater&#13;
treatment plant at Shahu, would permit primary treatment of up to 230,000 rn3/day of&#13;
wastewater diverted from East Lake. An additional 150,000 m3/day of wastewater would&#13;
be picked up on the south side of East Lake for discharge to South Lake after primary&#13;
treatment. At an investment cost of approximately Y 640 million, these two interventions&#13;
would divert and treat nearly all sewage flowing into East Lake and lead to the following&#13;
estimated change in East Lake quality over time:&#13;
Table 1: EAST LAKE PHOSPHORUS CONCENTRATIONS&#13;
Time (years)             1            3             5               10&#13;
Total Phosphorus        60           32            26               24&#13;
(mg/m 3)&#13;
14.   This would, for this indicator, improve water quality from Class IV to Class II.&#13;
These estimates assume the inflow of Yangtze River water needed to maintain the water&#13;
balance of East Lake, works for which would be included under the proposed project. Even&#13;
with the wastewater flow abated, total phosphorus levels remain high because of&#13;
phosphorus release from lake sediments. This problem is even more severe in other lakes&#13;
and marks the difficulty of finding short-run solutions to water quality problems. The&#13;
option of dredging the lake to remove polluted sediments was rejected as less effective than&#13;
further extensions of the sewerage network.&#13;
15.   An interceptor sewer would pick up 70 percent of sewage currently discharging to&#13;
Moshui Lake, with high quality water flows from the Han River providing water balance.&#13;
As noted above, Moshui serves solely as a waste sink at this point and no estimate has been&#13;
made of foregone services compared to a lake in this location with usable water quality.&#13;
Even with the planned diversion, given the very high pollutant loads in Moshui Lake&#13;
sediments, water quality recovery is expected to take more than the 10 years needed by East&#13;
Lake. Nonetheless, that recovery can be expected to bring the lake within Class V quality&#13;
within a decade. The least cost approach relies on an open settling basin, rather than&#13;
conventional treatment, to provide some solids removal prior to discharge to the Yangtze.&#13;
16.   The densely populated West Hankou area currently discharges wastewater through&#13;
open channels carrying combined stormwater and wastewater flows that eventually enter&#13;
the Fu River. That river currently rates as Class IV or V, depending on measurement site.&#13;
The existing open channels lack sufficient capacity for the growing wastewater volume, and&#13;
overflow into streets, fish ponds and agricultural land is common. The city plan is to&#13;
upgrade collection, providing the needed capacity to avoid overflows and, where possible,&#13;
fully enclosing the sewers. Discharge would continue to the Fu River, after preliminary&#13;
treatment. No quality improvement in that river would be possible until the addition of&#13;
further treatment, which is contemplated after the year 2000. The least cost solution sought&#13;

-162-                        ANNEX 14&#13;
to maximize capture of flows currently discharging to open channels within the overall&#13;
budget constraint on this component.&#13;
17.   Xiangfan. Currently, Xiangfan city wastewater flows discharge through tertiary&#13;
and some secondary sewers to the nearest river or, in the Xiangcheng district, the city moat.&#13;
As a result, those surface waters are highly polluted, with the smaller rivers such as the&#13;
Qilihe and Xiaoqinghe failing to reach Class V water quality, the lowest permissible for any&#13;
human use. Nonetheless, the water is used for irrigation, some is extracted for industrial&#13;
use, and human contact continues through uses such as fishing. A large number of&#13;
discharges go directly to the Han River, generally downstream of the municipal and&#13;
industrial raw water irntakes. Despite the high assimilative capacity of the Han, that river&#13;
falls from the Class I to Class II range above the city to Class III or IV below the city. The&#13;
Han stands to lose a third of its flow to the South-North water transfer project over the next&#13;
decade, and as it serves as a key raw water source down to Wuhan, the quality of its water is&#13;
a particular concern for the province. As the main upstream city, Xiangfan is under&#13;
pressure to minimize polluting inputs to the river.&#13;
18.   Xiangfan has designed a collection and treatment system for its wastewaters, but has&#13;
lacked adequate financing to install the system. After a review of the Xiangfan design and&#13;
assessment of costs and counterpart funding ability, it was clear that even with Bank&#13;
support the entire system could not be constructed within the time frame of this project.&#13;
Based on Xiangfan's counterpart funding ability, and sizing for year 2010 flows, the&#13;
physical scope of the project was determined by working upstream from the proposed&#13;
treatment plant site. Treatment was set at the preliminary level after an assimilative&#13;
capacity study showed that the 6.9 m3/sec municipal flows could continue to be discharged&#13;
directly to the Han with no net deterioration of Han quality. The new outfall will have&#13;
better dispersion characteristics than the current riverbank discharges. In anticipation of&#13;
later need, the preliminary treatment works are being designed and sufficient land is being&#13;
set aside for the addition of primary and secondary treatment as soon as that is feasible.&#13;
Because serving either the Xiangcheng or Fancheng districts required major river crossings,&#13;
only one could be supported under the project. The Fancheng crossing was substantially&#13;
less costly and the district has the larger wastewater flows, so the lowest cost per cubic&#13;
meter intercepted could be realized there. Conveyors of appropriate size were extended up&#13;
through the Fancheng catchment until funds ran out. This permitted most discharges to the&#13;
Xiaoqinghe and Qilihe, the largest rivers within Fancheng district, to be picked up. The&#13;
quality of those rivers should rise from below grade to approximately Class 111. It also&#13;
permitted interception of nearly all Fancheng neighborhood discharges to the Han, but here&#13;
the pollution impact was simply displaced downstream. Design and construction work on&#13;
further extensions of the system will be financed if the first phase realizes significant&#13;
savings compared to estimated construction costs.&#13;
19.   Huangshi. Huangshi is built back from the Yangtze and around Cihu Lake (see&#13;
Map 27175). The bulk of the urban wastewater discharges into Cihu, which itself&#13;
discharges through a pump station to the Yangtze. Cihu, which serves fishing, swimming&#13;
and amenity needs, has deteriorated from Class III to less than Class V on its southern side&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-163 -                       ANNEX 14&#13;
over the past decade. Very rapid industrial and residential growth has accelerated nutrient&#13;
build up in the lake, which now experiences eutrophication that will soon become extremely&#13;
serious.&#13;

20.   The Huangshi urban development master plan calls for interceptor sewers that&#13;
would parallel the lake shore on both the north and south sides, picking up all wastewater&#13;
flows currently entering the lake. Counterpart funding and loan size constraints allow only&#13;
the first phase of this work to be undertaken in the next five years. The least cost strategy&#13;
was based on picking up the largest wastewater flows with the available funds, forgoing any&#13;
but preliminary treatment before discharge to the Yangtze. The engineering costing details&#13;
of the options are available in the project files. Because of similar composition of the&#13;
physical and labor inputs to the alternative investments, the engineering prices serve as an&#13;
adequate guide to comparative economic costs. The analysis showed that with the heavier&#13;
concentration of residential and industrial flows on the south side of the lake, the unit cost&#13;
of picking up flows was lower there. As this was also the most seriously polluted section of&#13;
the lake, the choice was made to build the south trunk sewer first. This sewer will serve&#13;
approximately 120,000 people. The south trunk sewer work alone is estimated to bring&#13;
Cihu Lake back to Class III water quality, eliminating the risk to current uses.&#13;
21.   Sewered flows will discharge to the Yangtze. The Yangtze assimilative capacity is&#13;
sufficiently high in relation to Huangshi flows (2.2 m3/sec for Huangshi vs. 23,800 m3/sec&#13;
for the Yangtze) that treatment is not needed at this stage. Therefore, as in Xiangfan, a&#13;
preliminary treatment plant will be built at a site large enough for, and with preliminarv&#13;
treatment works sized for, later expansion to primary and then secondary treatment.&#13;
Wastes Disposal&#13;
22.   Of the four project cities, only Wuhan and Huangshi have sanitary landfills or other&#13;
means of preventing solid waste from becoming a long term environmental threat. The&#13;
Wuhan site handles less than 25 percent of the city's municipal solid waste, and the&#13;
Huangshi site takes about one third of that city's municipal solid waste. The remaining&#13;
wastes go to either municipal dumps that, while well managed, lack any provision for&#13;
leachate or gas control, or to informal dumps that lack the management of the municipal&#13;
dumps. The other cities rely on a combination of municipal and informal dumps. Based on&#13;
international experience, dumps without leachate or gas control pose a long run threat to the&#13;
aquifers that run under them, to watercourses that receive leachate from them, and to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-164 -                         ANNEX 14&#13;
surrounding land. If landfill gasses are not collected and flared, they contribute substantial&#13;
amiounits of methane to the atmosphere. For these reasons, China has joined many other&#13;
countries in stipulating minimum standards for leachate and gas control in landfilling of&#13;
municipal solid waste.&#13;
23 *.   Potential solid waste disposal strategies include recycling, composting, incineration,&#13;
and landfilling. Recycling plays an active role in each of the cities, capturing most of the&#13;
5 percent of the municipal waste stream that can be profitably recycled. The industry is&#13;
highly competitive, withl little scope for additional useful municipal intervention.&#13;
Composting, to recycle organic materials, has been tested with scant success in Wuhan and&#13;
other Chinese cities. Costs have been high and markets have not supported product sales.&#13;
A major problem for composting and incineration is that over half of the waste stream is&#13;
inorganic, with coal ash the dominant inorganic component. Analysis in other Chinese&#13;
cities with similar waste streams has shown incineration to be substantially more costly than&#13;
landfill. Based on that work, each of the four cities hias elected to use landfilling to handle&#13;
their municipal solid wastes.&#13;
24.    Eaclh of the project cities faces the need to build new sites, as current sites are&#13;
approaching capacity. Cities have accepted that new solid waste disposal sites must comply&#13;
with national standards, so have made no attempt to undertake the very difficult comparison&#13;
of the cost of adding leachate and gas collection with the damage that would ensue from&#13;
their absence. Damage estimates would depend on leachate diffusion through aquifers,&#13;
systematic sampling of local water bodies to identify leachate impacts, then estimation of&#13;
economic uses of those waters over time and the cost of forgone use or pollution&#13;
amelioration. Gas emission volumes and dispersion would be easier to estimate, but&#13;
damage valuation would be very uncertain. Given the long run risks inherent in unprotected&#13;
landfills, the Bank accepted the municipal judgment on the need to provide leachate and gas&#13;
collection and treatment without additional impact evaluation.&#13;
25.    Once the decision was made on landfill standards, each city faced the need to&#13;
identify the least cost site and design. Wuhan, Xiangfan, Yichang, and Huangslhi each&#13;
considered a number of alternative locations, with one of the main decision criteria being to&#13;
minimize the joint cost of transport, land acquisition and site development. As land&#13;
acquisition cost correlates very strongly with resettlement impact, this criteria also&#13;
minimizes resettlement. Yichang identified two potential sites with similar haul distances&#13;
and resettlement impact. The site chosen was preferred because the other site was in a new&#13;
industrial development zone and thought to be an inappropriate use of land in such a zone.&#13;
Huangshi narrowed its choices to three sites, with the Xisai site preferred for easy access&#13;
and minimum impact on surrounding populations. Wuhan had an existing site with suitable&#13;
land available for expansion. To take advantage of existing infrastructure, no other sites&#13;
were considered. Detailed assessment of the choices by each city is described in the project&#13;
files. Xiangfan has two possible sites that appear to have similar unit costs. Detailed&#13;
analysis has been completed on one site and continues on the other.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-165-                         ANNEX 14&#13;
Industrial Pollution Control&#13;
26.   The industrial pollution control component has two subcomponents, one a line of&#13;
credit for major investments and the other a pollution control fund targeting small&#13;
investments and small-scale enterprises. Eligibility for the line of credit was restricted in&#13;
the first instance to Hubei's 117 most polluting industrial enterprises, which are responsible&#13;
for over 60 percent of industrial pollution in Hubei. The toxicity of enterprises' pollutants&#13;
and the population affected by the pollution were evaluated. The higlhest-imiipact firms were&#13;
then subject to a simple economic screening that eliminated (a) all enterprises which had a&#13;
negative net worth and were losing money, and (b) any enterprise whose abatement strategy&#13;
depended on production of a commodity in which the enterprise had no prior experience.&#13;
With priority based on their environmental impact, remaining firms were then eligible for&#13;
more thorough technical, financial, and economic appraisal. The funds available for&#13;
subloans would finance pollution control programs for approximately six firms, if current&#13;
investment plans remain unchanged after appraisal. One appraisal of Ezhou Iron &amp; Steel&#13;
(Egang) was successfully undertaken during overall project appraisal, to test the quality of&#13;
local appraisal efforts.  The remainder will be done in the early months of project&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
27.   Technical appraisal will focus on feasibility and efficiency:  is operation of the&#13;
proposed investment within the technical capabilities of the firm, and will it result in&#13;
production clean enough to meet national and local discharge standards while yielding a&#13;
significant improvement in ambient air or water quality for a significant population. The&#13;
economic appraisal will look at whether the technical choice was the most economically&#13;
efficient among technical alternatives and whether the input and output market prospects&#13;
support the sustainability of the financial appraisal results. The financial appraisal will&#13;
focus on the company as a whole, rather than on the particular technology. This is because&#13;
the most effective intervention may be end-of-pipe treatment of an effluent stream, with no&#13;
financial return other than cessation of effluent fees.&#13;
28.   The successful appraisal covered two investments at the enterprise ranked as most&#13;
environmentally damaging among viable firms. Details of the appraisal may be found in&#13;
the Project Files. The key appraisal finding showed the firm to be financially healthy and&#13;
economically viable. The firm benefited from progressive price liberalization after 1992,&#13;
and in 1994 had net profits of Y 220 million on sales of Y 1,520 million and low debt&#13;
compared to the industry average. The latter finding was particularly important given the&#13;
rapid integration of China's steel industry into the international market economy. In&#13;
brief, the first Egang investment will replace a 40-year old electric arc furnace that is&#13;
responsible for 23 percent of the TSP concentrations within an urban area containing some&#13;
200,000 people. The proposed investment is in a new furnace, incorporating up-to-date air&#13;
pollution control, which will produce virtually no particulates or NO, and will improve air&#13;
quality for affected people from Class III to Class IL. The new furnace will have higher&#13;
capacity than the old one and will also use less electricity per ton of steel produced. TFlc&#13;
investment will yield an estimated 12 percent financial and 23 percent economic rate ot&#13;
return on the investment, where the economic rate of return incorporates none of die air&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

quality gains. Most of the gap between the financial and economic rates of return is due to&#13;
the fact that Egang steel is priced 20 to 30 percent below CIF imported prices for equivalent&#13;
products. That gap leaves substantial room to absorb price pressures should the world steel&#13;
market soften. Table 3 summarizes the economic return calculation.&#13;

Economic Rate of Return = 23%&#13;
Note: The new furnace would begin production in 1999, producing 150,000 tons that year and reaching&#13;
full capacity of 300,000 tons by 2001. The with-project steel is higher quality and thus commands a&#13;
higher price.&#13;
29.    The analysis also looked at the sensitivity of the economic rate of returns to&#13;
various changes. The four factors judged to have the greatest impact on the economic&#13;
rate of return were changes in the economic price of steel, an increase in input costs&#13;
relative to sales prices, higher-than-anticipated capital costs, and lower-than-anticipated&#13;
efficiency levels. Egang steel prices are already over 20 percent below border prices for&#13;
the product and a further 10 percent price drop would drop the ERR by 3 percent. An&#13;
increase in input costs would have relatively little impact on the ERR because it would&#13;
have a nearly equal impact on the without-project scenario, where steel production&#13;
continues with the current furnace-a 10 percent cost increase would drop the ERR by&#13;
only I percent. The ERR is also relatively insensitive to capital cost increases, with a&#13;
2 percent drop for a 10 percent capital cost increase. A further factor considered was a&#13;
"learning curve" in using the new fumace, whereby operating efficiency would be below&#13;
the norm for, say, the first three years of operation. Given the large staff of engineers and&#13;
operators experienced with electric-arc furnaces, three years is seen as an outer bound for&#13;
those efficiency  losses.   Of these various factors, the risk of "learning  curve"&#13;
inefficiencies and steel price decreases are judged most likely (although vis-a-vis the&#13;
international market, upside price potential would appear to outweigh downside). To&#13;
drop the ERR to the test level of 12 percent, a combination of factors including a&#13;
20 percent drop in sales price (to over 40 percent below international market levels), a&#13;
I0 percent increase in capital costs, and a 10 percent "learning curve" drop in efficiency&#13;
would have to occur. This or similar adverse combinations are judged highly unlikely&#13;
given Egang's operating experience and recent market history in the key input and output&#13;
markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-167-                        ANNEX 14&#13;
30.   The high and robust economic returns to the proposed air pollution control&#13;
investment are an example of a "win-win" solution to an environmental problem.&#13;
However, Egang also includes an example of damaging wastewater discharges that are&#13;
difficult to value, and the main available intervention increases operating costs with no&#13;
corresponding increase in a marketable product. Egang discharges some 17 tons a year of&#13;
phenol, 11.8 tons of cyanide, and 462 tons of oil, as well as substantial solids and COD&#13;
into local watercourses and then the Yangtze.  The phenol and cyanide are over&#13;
90 percent of all such discharges in Ezhou city and the oil 63 percent, with the result that&#13;
the major urban waterways fall to category IV for phenol and oil, and II for cyanide.&#13;
31.   To reduce these discharges, Egang will substantially revamp their wastewater&#13;
handling system. All discharges currently entering the Yanglan Lake or Xingang River&#13;
will be intercepted, treated, and reused, ending Egang's contribution to their pollution.&#13;
Yanglan Lake is fished and used as an industrial water supply source. Xingang stream&#13;
provides potable water for villagers and a source of industrial water supply.  No&#13;
epidemiological work has been done on the impact of Egang discharges through fish&#13;
consumption or domestic water supply, so damage estimates were not possible. The most&#13;
serious discharges, from the coking plant, will continue to discharge directly to the&#13;
Yangtze. However, a new coking wastewater treatment plant financed by the project will&#13;
radically reduce pollutants in that discharge, with, for example, phenol falling from 1.53&#13;
tons/year to 0.45 tons/year and oil from 32.4 tons/year to 6.5 tons/year. The net effect of&#13;
the investment will be to bring the Xingang River and Yuanlan Lake to Class II in tllese&#13;
pollutants, allowing safe use of the water. The cost is high-an estimated Y 130 million&#13;
or $13 million.&#13;
32.   Based on the industrial pollution control ranking system, investments in Egang are&#13;
anticipated to have the most substantial positive environmental impacts. The remaining&#13;
top-ranked firms on the short list are two cement plants, wastewater and waste gas treatment&#13;
at two chemical plants and wastewater treatment at a pharmaceutical plant.&#13;
33.   The environmental pollution control fund remains to be established, so cannot be&#13;
assessed in the same way the line-of-credit can be. The goal of the fund differs from the&#13;
line of credit, in that it strives to serve as a model for the operation of the municipal and&#13;
county run pollution control funds capitalized through pollution levy fees. These are&#13;
revolving funds, but to date have lacked effective management, targeting, and credit&#13;
policies. Hence, while the appraisal goals are similar to the line of credit, the target firms&#13;
and pollution problems are much smaller scale. The fund will seek to minimize&#13;
management costs, while effectively recycling loans. The fund will bear credit risk, for,&#13;
like the line of credit, banks will play a solely agent role. Again, like the line of credit,&#13;
loans will be made at a rate at least 150 basis points above the Bank variable rate, the&#13;
margin to be determined by operating costs and credit risk assessment. However, the fund&#13;
will not have the direct power of the finance bureau to encourage timely loan servicing by&#13;
enterprises. Also, it will face a history of disbursement of pollution levy fees as grants. The&#13;
fund will respond to these risks in two ways. First, by careful financial analysis and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-168-                       ANNEX 14&#13;
conservative lending and second by concentrating on smaller loans with relatively short&#13;
repayment periods.&#13;
C. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
34.   The project would contribute significantly to improving Hubei's environment, in&#13;
ways detailed in the body of the SAR and the annexes. Potential adverse impacts from the&#13;
sanitary landfill and industrial pollution control components require an "A" category in&#13;
terms of the World Bank's Operational Directive on Environmental Assessment (EA).&#13;
Accordingly, a full EA has been completed, reviewed by the Bank and approved by NEPA.&#13;
The full report can be found in the project files. Annex 8 details the EA findings and&#13;
reflects the findings of the appraisal mission. The resettlement impact of the project will be&#13;
managed through a resettlement action plan that can be found in the project files and is&#13;
summarized in Annex 7.&#13;
D. AFFORDABILITY AND POVERTY ASSESSMENT&#13;
35.   The affordability issue arises only with the wastewater components of the proposed&#13;
project. The industrial pollution interventions will proceed only if the enterprise can&#13;
demonstrate that it will remain financially sound after the investment, and solid waste&#13;
charges will rise only for industrial and commercial users of the new landfills.&#13;
Affordability of the new wastewater systems was tested against current consumption&#13;
pattems and average income of the poorest 10 percent of the urban population in the three&#13;
cities. The proposed first year tariff would consume an average of 0.25 percent of the&#13;
income of the poorest 10 percent, based on 80 percent of water used. Indeed, because the&#13;
poor are less likely than other households to have water piped to the house (using&#13;
standpipes instead, for which no fees are currently charged), even the 0.25 percent figure&#13;
represents an upper bound.&#13;
36.   The affordability of the higher tariffs anticipated in later years will clearly depend&#13;
on changes in real income among the urban poor over time. In real terms, the tariffs will&#13;
increase to as much as twice the anticipated 1996 rate. With no change in real income and&#13;
no consumption effect, the average wastewater bill would increase to 0.50 percent of&#13;
average income for the poorest 10 percent of households. However, over the past decade,&#13;
the real incomes of the urban poor have risen in line with overall income increases. If that&#13;
pattem, and overall real personal income growth, continues near current rates, wastewater&#13;
tariffs as a percentage of personal income would remain virtually unchanged from the first&#13;
year level. In absolute terms, the increase would be fully offset by first year income gains.&#13;
E. PROJECT RisKs&#13;
37.   The proposed project faces or mitigates a variety of risks. Those risks are here&#13;
grouped under three general headings: implementation and operational risks, regulatory&#13;
risk, and risks to long term sustainability. Each type of risk will be discussed in turn.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-169-                       ANNEX 14&#13;
Implementation and Operation Risks&#13;
38.   These risks include a variety of institutional, physical, and financial factors that&#13;
could interfere with the timely construction or operation of any of the project elements, or&#13;
with the implementation of the institutional innovations. Specifically, these include:&#13;
Municipal Components&#13;
39.   Procurement Risks: Lack of familiarity with Bank procurement procedures and&#13;
policies may lead to delayed procurement. Experience in a wide array of Bank projects has&#13;
shown this risk to be substantial among new borrowers. HUEPO's use of an experienced&#13;
Chinese tendering company (already engaged) will help mitigate the risk in preparing&#13;
commercial documents. The plan to use international consultants experienced with Bankl&#13;
financed projects to provide advisory services on preparation of technical documents.&#13;
HUEPO will sign a contract for the latter services by negotiations and the consultant team&#13;
will be in place well before effectiveness.&#13;
40.   Financial Risks: These risks are of two sorts, those of counterpart funding and&#13;
operational funding. Counterpart funding risks derive from the fact that the Bank loan&#13;
covers only part of the construction costs. The wastewater agencies are financing a&#13;
relatively small proportion of the investment out of current income, and that income&#13;
depends on implementation of the new tariffs (discussed further under policy risk). Given&#13;
the inelastic demand for water in the three cities (on consumption of which the wastewater&#13;
charges are based), the conservative billing assumptions used, and the fact that the initial&#13;
tariff increase will be implemented before project effectiveness, the risk of inadequate&#13;
wastewater company revenues is deemed to be low. The bulk of the counterpart funds are&#13;
allocated from the municipal budget. Indeed, to minimize risks in this area, municipal&#13;
budgets were analyzed under the assumption that all counterpart funding would come from&#13;
that source.  Those budgets have been analyzed under growth assumptions that are&#13;
conservative compared to recent experience. Even then, counterpart funding requirements&#13;
would amount to less than 3 percent of on-budget revenues and no more than 40 percent of&#13;
recent on-budget capital investment allocations in all but Xiangfan. Given the importance&#13;
of off-budget revenues to cities (up to half of total revenue), both of those indicators suggest&#13;
a higher exposure than actually exists.&#13;
41.   Xiangfan's investment program would demand up to 4 percent of annual total on-&#13;
budget expenditures and would represent, in the peak year, a doubling of the historical on-&#13;
budget capital expenditures. Again, given the growing importance of off-budget income&#13;
and investment, these figures overstate project exposure in Xiangfan. As with all the&#13;
project cities, Xiangfan has identified and committed to specific funding sources for this&#13;
project. Furthermore, the Bank sought independent analysis from the provincial finance&#13;
bureau of the availability of and risks to the stated funding sources. Based on the Bank and&#13;
provincial finance bureau assessments, the Xiangfan investment program was pared down&#13;
to its current level, as representing a feasible investment under the conservative growth&#13;
assumptions.  Nonetheless, a substantial slowdown in municipal revenue growth, which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-170 -                        ANNEX 14&#13;
would likely accompany any major downturn in the national economic cycle, would force&#13;
the city to cut back on ongoing investments.  Under similar circumstances, local&#13;
governments in other Bank-supported projects in China have sometimes reduced their&#13;
annual counterpart funding, lengthening the construction period. In Xiangfan's case,&#13;
counterpart funding risks are minimized during the first year of implementation by the fact&#13;
that the appraisal of the Xiangfan solid waste component has been delayed (for technical&#13;
reasons unrelated to financing). This will allow overall progress in the first year of project&#13;
implementation to be evaluated before committing to the additional landfill investment.&#13;
42.   In terms of operational funding, Hubei province and the cities have agreed to a&#13;
financial covenant that will, for wastewater operations, generate sufficient revenues&#13;
through operations to meet anticipated operational, depreciation, and loan repayment&#13;
needs.  Initial tariff adjustments prior to project effectiveness, in addition, allow a&#13;
contribution to capital. Solid waste operations will continue to rely on direct government&#13;
allocations for a part of their operating costs, given the difficulty of billing households on&#13;
a waste volume basis (per capita or per household taxes substitute for this). However, the&#13;
ability fully to cost and charge for the important commercial and industrial services will&#13;
increase revenues to the environmental sanitation bureaus, reducing dependence on the&#13;
city and the risk of inadequate operating funds.&#13;
43.   Construction Risk:  The proposed investments differ little in construction&#13;
demands from other work already successfully undertaken in the cities themselves, or&#13;
elsewhere in the province. The one possible exception to this would come if the landfill&#13;
in Yichang is deemed to need an artificial liner. Such liners have been rarely used in&#13;
China and need particular care during installation and operation. To minimize this risk,&#13;
the installation contract will require firms to demonstrate successful experience in the&#13;
field.&#13;
44.   Operational Risk: This risk is deemed to be very small due to the fact that all of&#13;
the proposed technologies are in successful operation either in the cities themselves, or in&#13;
other Chinese cities or plants with staff of equivalent background and training. The&#13;
technical assistance planned under the project would further mitigate this risk by providing&#13;
operational training on all newly constructed municipal facilities.&#13;
45.   The shift to new organizational forms for wastewater management is critical to&#13;
project success.  All cities are well along in the process, with Xiangfan having&#13;
successfully completed the transformation to an enterprise. In Huangshi, assets have been&#13;
revalued and that work is being reviewed by the State Asset Bureau, the last step before&#13;
formal transfer. Wuhan has begun revaluing assets and expects to undertake the transfer by&#13;
the end of 1995, well before planned effectiveness. The groundwork is thus laid for&#13;
introduction of the new accounting and management information systems needed to&#13;
efficiently guide the work of these enterprises. In the long run, efficient operation will&#13;
also depend on cities honoring the autonomy of the enterprises in personnel and other&#13;
management decisions. This element of risk cannot be divorced from larger efforts&#13;
within the economy to reforrn government relations with the state owned enterprise&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-171-                        ANNEX 14&#13;
sector. These issues have recently received thorough analysis in State Owned Enterprise&#13;
Reform (currently in yellow cover). The solid waste sector presents a rather different&#13;
challenge, as this will continue in bureau form. Here, the challenge is to introduce the&#13;
new accounting tools. The risk to this is minimized by the advantage to the ESB of being&#13;
able to identify costs and thus justify the tariffs agreed to by the cities.&#13;
Industrial pollution control component&#13;
46.   Two main types of risk to the industrial pollution control component will be&#13;
addressed here. These are credit risk and the risk that the pollution abatement goals are&#13;
not met.&#13;
47.   Credit risk under the project is borne by the provincial government. Under the&#13;
line of credit, the agent bank, for a fee, undertakes project appraisal and handles fund&#13;
administration on behalf of the provincial government. An essential element of the&#13;
project appraisal, which is subject to review and confirmation by the provincial finance&#13;
bureau, is analysis of the firm's financial strength and the risk it faces in its input and&#13;
output markets. The firm must meet a 1.4 debt service coverage requirement over the&#13;
project life, providing that margin of safety to the government exposure. Representatives&#13;
of the provincial finance bureau have stated that their subjective estimate of the credit risk&#13;
in the project approaches zero. They argue that within the Chinese system as currently&#13;
structured, the finance bureau has sufficient discretionary power over the state owned&#13;
enterprises seeking access to the line of credit that they have primacy over all other&#13;
creditors. Nonetheless, the loans are being made at no less than 150 basis points over the&#13;
Bank variable lending rate, in US dollars, with the enterprise bearing the foreign&#13;
exchange risk. With fees to the agent Bank amounting to no more than 50 basis points,&#13;
the provincial government will capture at least 100 basis points to cover their costs and&#13;
risks. In addition, they will enjoy the use of loan and interest payments in the interval&#13;
between collection from the enterprise and repayment to the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
48.   Given the well-known failure of many enterprises to operate their pollution&#13;
abatement facilities, the analysis addressed the risk that pollution abatement goals would&#13;
not be met. Based on the short-listed project designs, this risk is deemed to be very&#13;
small. The reason is that, although not a requirement for access to the line-of-credit, the&#13;
bulk of the proposed investments are in process changes. The pollution abatement in&#13;
these investments derives not from add-on equipment, but from the intrinsic properties of&#13;
the production process compared to the original. Thus, the proposed electric arc furnace&#13;
for Egang does not have a "dirty" operating mode that could be used to save power or&#13;
other inputs. Nor do the proposed kilns in the cement plants. An exception to this pattern&#13;
can be found in the wastewater treatment plans for Egang. Here, one part of the strategy&#13;
involves treating and reusing the cleanest part of the wastewater stream, and the reuse&#13;
demand will help ensure adequate treatment. But the coke oven wastewater will, after&#13;
treatment, discharge as before to the Yangtze. If the treatment plant were to shut down,&#13;
enterprise operation would be cheaper but not otherwise affected. The only way to&#13;
mitigate this risk is aggressive monitoring and application of heavy fines for violations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-172 -                        ANNEX 14&#13;
The local EPB does not have a history of such an approach, but has indicated that because&#13;
the EPB system helped Egang gain access to the line of credit, Egang now has a moral&#13;
obligation to operate the equipment, an obligation that did not previously exist.&#13;
Moreover, the EPB system is more generally stepping up its pollution levy fee collections&#13;
and pollution licensing system. so the new equipment will come on line in an era of&#13;
increased attention to compliance.&#13;
Policy/Regulatory Risk&#13;
49.   Major policy risks include: (a) possible resistance to timely implementation of the&#13;
new tarif'f structure and (b) that the sustained investment program needed for full wastes&#13;
control stretches well beyond the closing date of the proposed project and must be&#13;
continued to hold the water, solid waste and air pollution levels within efficient limits.&#13;
Thlese risks are all characterized by the importance of positive government action at either&#13;
the provincial or municipal level. The related institutional innovation risk was analyzed&#13;
earlier.&#13;
50.   Of the above risks, failure to implement agreed tariffs would seriously impair the&#13;
performance incentives of the utilities and their ability to finance ongoing investment&#13;
programs. To mitigate this risk, a tariff increase before negotiation is being required and&#13;
tariffs will be a supervision focal point. The latter will be aided by the fact that service&#13;
providers are required to present annual accounts showing whether existing tariffs have met&#13;
their financial needs and to project tariff levels needed in the following year.&#13;
51.   To encourage continued implementation of the broader environmental services&#13;
investment program, the proposed project includes funds for further project preparation and&#13;
introduces a tariff strategy that will sustain future investment. At least as important to&#13;
minimizing risk in the long run program is increasing citizen attention to and demand for&#13;
environmental improvements. That trend is being spurred by a special committee of the&#13;
National People's Congress. While citizen awareness is not supported directly by the&#13;
project, the spread of the investments is designed to provide solid evidence of the gains&#13;
from pollution control and thus gamer support for further action.&#13;
52.   Significant regulatory risks arise because the pollution control results anticipated&#13;
for the surface waters depend not only on sewerage technologies successfully constructed&#13;
and operated by the cities. Many important pollutants must be controlled at source by the&#13;
industries generating them.  A failure to do so could threaten either the sewerage&#13;
int'rastructure or the quality of the various lakes and rivers, depending on enterprise&#13;
discharge points. The principal means of mitigating this risk is a strong regulatory&#13;
regime. The importance of this work was recognized during preparation of the project&#13;
and is addressed under the environmental action plan (Annex I1).&#13;
Risks to Long-Term Sustainability&#13;
53.   The major risks to long term sustainability are financial and regulatory, and have&#13;
been discussed above. Additional risks arise from outside of the cities themselves and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-173 -                       ANNEX 14&#13;
center on polluting inputs to the various water bodies from areas beyond municipal&#13;
control. These additional pollutants could overwhelm any benefit that would otherwise&#13;
be realized by the planned investments. In the case of the network of waterways within&#13;
the cities, this risk is not great. Most of their watersheds are small, pollutants are of local&#13;
origin, and their control will be a function of the proper operation of the project.&#13;
However, the Han and Yangtze suffer from nonpoint source pollutants, particularly&#13;
agricultural, and carry substantial nutrient loads from upstream agriculture as well as&#13;
industrial pollution discharges. Satisfactory abatement of those polluting sources will&#13;
depend on the actions of a large number of political jurisdictions, most of which would&#13;
suffer no immediate harm from continued discharges to these rivers. The growing&#13;
appreciation within China of the importance of water pollution abatement offers the best&#13;
hope of inducing compliance with the current industrial regulations.  A  similar&#13;
appreciation of the risks from agriculture has yet to appear, and must become an element&#13;
of river basin quality control.&#13;
54.   Even if loads from other sources remain as predicted, minimizing any impact&#13;
from growing municipal loads will require a high degree of municipal treatment in&#13;
Xiangfan particularly.  There, the Han river faces the prospect of substantial flow&#13;
reductions if the South-North Water Transfer project proceeds. Even before those flows&#13;
fall, the environmental assessment for this project highlighted the importance of the Han&#13;
as a drinking water source and that absent early introduction of secondary treatment to&#13;
Xiangfan flows, the Han would fall below the Class II status that makes it a desirable raw&#13;
water source for municipal use.&#13;

            The Hubei Urban Environmental Project is
            part of a phased development program designed to improve
            environmental conditions and management in Hubei Province.
            Specific objectives of this project are to: 1) put in place
            institutions and policies able to sustain progress on the
            provincial plan for environmental improvement; 2) improve
            wastewater collection and treatment in three cities, thus
            maintaining and raising surface water quality to levels
            suitable for municipal supply, agricultural, or other
            purposes; 3) improve wastes management in four cities, thus
            protecting water and land quality; and 4) identify the
            highest-impact industrial air and water polluters and
            significantly reduce their pollution. The project will
            support policy and institutional innovation, and provide
            physical works for wastewater handling, air pollution
            control, and solid waste management. Its components are the
            following: 1) Wastewater management in Huangshi, Wuhan and
            Xiangfan, comprising sewer systems, pump stations, and
            wastewater treatment facilities; 2) municipal wastes
            management in Huangshi, Wuhan, Xiangfan and Yichang,
            comprising sanitary landfill development, waste transfer
            facilities, vehicles and equipment; 3) industrial pollution
            control; 4) Hubei environmental pollution control fund; 5)
            water quality monitoring and management in Hubei and Wuhan
            environmental monitoring centers, comprising water quality
            monitoring technology, data management equipment, and
            institutional development; and 6) institutional
            strengthening through technical assistance and training.
