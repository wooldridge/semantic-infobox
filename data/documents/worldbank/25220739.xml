(i) Bank-executed Activities&#13;
The Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) assists client countries to&#13;
increase know-how and institutional capacity to achieve environmentally sustainable energy&#13;
solutions for poverty reduction and economic growth. The objective of the ESMAP&#13;
Programmatic Multi-Donor Trust Fund is to provide multi-year funding support to&#13;
implement the ESMAP Strategic Business Plans (SBPs) for 2008-2013 and 2014-2018, and&#13;
associated annual work programs, as endorsed by the ESMAP governing body, the&#13;
Consultative Group for the Energy Trust Funded Programs.&#13;
The ESMAP SBP for 2008-2013 presents, and the ESMAP SBP for 2014-2018 will present&#13;
(when endorsed by the Consultative Group for the Energy Trust Funded Programs), the core&#13;
set of: (i) continuing and proposed programs through which ESMAP will continue&#13;
supporting client countries to better address the energy security and poverty reduction nexus;&#13;
and (ii) newly identified ESMAP initiatives that address thematic challenges and thereby&#13;
strengthen ESMAP's comparative advantage as a global knowledge and technical assistance&#13;
partnership.&#13;
Specifically, ESMAP's activities are developed around the following areas of focus:&#13;
Component 1: Energy Assessments and Strategy TA Programs (EAS-TAP) will enhance&#13;
institutional capacity of client countries to conduct energy assessments, develop strategies&#13;
and investment programs and designing robust frameworks to track, monitor, and evaluate&#13;
intervention costs and benefits of: i) measures to mitigate national energy systems&#13;
vulnerabilities; ii) regional energy integration; and/or iii) low carbon growth.&#13;
Component 2: Pro-poor Energy Access TA Programs (PEA-TAP) will assist client countries&#13;
to formulate and implement policy reform measures and strategies to: i) close the energy&#13;
access gap for the poor through enhancing the productivity of SMEs both as providers and&#13;
users of modem energy services to the poor in rural and urban communities; ii) enhance&#13;
poverty reduction impacts of national/rural electrification programs; and iii) achieve gender&#13;
sensitive energy sector development.&#13;
Component 3: Energy Efficient Cities Initiative (EECI) to assist cities to deploy energy&#13;
efficient solutions for the delivery of basic urban services.&#13;
Component 4: Renewable Energy Market Transformation Initiative (REMTI) to assist client&#13;
countries to diversify their energy supply mix and scale up deployment of renewable energy&#13;
technology.&#13;

functions required for efficient management of the program.&#13;
