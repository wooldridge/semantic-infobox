recommendation pursuant to said Section in respect of the proposal that the Association extend to the Inter-&#13;
Governmental Authority on Development (the Recipient) a grant in an amount equivalent to&#13;
SDR 3,300,000. The purposes of said grant are to enhance livelihood resilience of pastoral and agro-&#13;
pastoral communities in cross-border drought prone areas of Selected Countries and improve the capacity&#13;
of the Selected Countries' governments to respond promptly and effectively to an Eligible Crisis or&#13;
Emergency.&#13;

purposes to which the proceeds of the grant are to be applied.&#13;
2.     The Committee is of the opinion that the project toward the financing of which the proceeds of&#13;
such grant are to be applied comes within the purposes of the Association as set forth in Article I of said&#13;
Articles of Agreement, and that said project is designed to promote the economic development of the&#13;
Selected Countries which are IGAD member states and is of high developmental priority in the light of the&#13;
needs of the Selected Countries.&#13;
