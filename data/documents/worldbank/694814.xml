EDUCATION INNOVATION PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    The education system in Russia has been characterized by high enrollment in primary and&#13;
secondary education, impressive levels of literacy, equitable access for girls and excellent academic&#13;
achievements particularly in mathematics and natural sciences. However, in the centrally planned&#13;
economy, there was an inefficient use of resources, overstaffing and high unit costs, together with&#13;
duplication and fragmented programs. There were few opportunities for non-university, post-secondary&#13;
education. The system had weak incentives for teaching independent enquiry, critical thinking, or&#13;
problem solving.&#13;
1.2    As early as 1985, and increasingly after 1990, it was recognized in Russia that reform of&#13;
education was needed to develop informed citizens capable of participating in a democratic society as well&#13;
as to give workers more marketable skills. In the intervening years much has been accomplished to&#13;
reorient the system by transferring a number of administrative and fiscal responsibilities from the center&#13;
to the regions and by granting greater freedom and incentives to regions to increase efficiency, change&#13;
the content of curricula, promote pedagogic initiatives and achieve greater responsiveness to the demands&#13;
of the evolving labor market.&#13;
1.3   If Russia is to restore economic growth and achieve competitiveness in an international market,&#13;
it is essential that the education system be strengthened to improve the quality of teaching and to reorient&#13;
management structures to take into account the new responsibilities of federal and regional authorities for&#13;
decision making and finance in the education sector. The legacy of centralized control, rigidity and lack&#13;
of accountability continue to constrain efforts at innovation and greater efficiency and to hamper local&#13;
and private initiatives in education. The challenge will be to reorient the education system to encompass&#13;
the demands of a new economic system while retaining the considerable strengths and achievements of&#13;
the past in a period of severe fiscal constraint.&#13;
A. Sector Description&#13;
1.4    Structure: Education in Russia consists of 9 years of compulsory basic education (7-15 year olds).&#13;
Three types of secondary education exist: (a) general secondary education which has little or no&#13;
vocational content and is the preparation for entering higher education and other types of education; (b)&#13;
vocational education (2-3 years) geared to the preparation of skilled workers and trades; and (c) secondary&#13;
specialized education (2-4 years depending on the point of entry) offering a more theoretical curriculum&#13;
along with training in more sophisticated technical skills. Higher education consists of 535 public&#13;
institutions: 129 universities, 28 academies, and 378 colleges. In addition there are 193 non-public higher&#13;
education institutions (141 are licensed institutions). In 1992, the State Committee for Higher Education&#13;
(SCHE) suggested that Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) introduce a multilevel structure for higher&#13;
education. It divides the system into three layers consisting of a four year Bachelors program, a five year&#13;
professional certificate program, and a six year Master's program. Approximately 20 percent of&#13;
institutions have adopted this structure. This makes the length of these institutions' degree programs&#13;
roughly comparable to OECD systems, while fostering flexibility and greater efficiencies. In August&#13;
1996, the Ministry of Education and the SCHE were amalgamated into one Ministry of General and&#13;
Professional Education (MGPE).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                                                 Chapter I&#13;
1.5    Enrollments: Russian education has traditionally had an enrollment of virtually 100 percent of&#13;
children of compulsory school age. After completing compulsory education, over 50 percent of school&#13;
children continue their education in general secondary schools, approximately 30 percent in vocational&#13;
schools, and approximately 20 percent in technical secondary schools. Total enrollment has declined&#13;
since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, by 9 percent in secondary technical schools, 7 percent&#13;
in vocational schools, and 5 percent in higher education. Only in compulsory education has the number&#13;
of students increased. At the same time the size of the age cohort and the demand for higher education,&#13;
especially in skills required for new labor markets, are on the increase. If these trends continue they will&#13;
change the future demand for schooling and the need for teachers and facilities.&#13;
1.6    Basic indicators: Russia's education indicators compare favorably with OECD countries in many&#13;
respects. Participation and access have been high at the preschool and compulsory levels. Female&#13;
participation in higher education is equal to that of males. Higher education has a lower participation rate&#13;
than the OECD average. Repetition and dropout have been traditionally almost non-existent. Average&#13;
levels of achievement in mathematics and natural sciences are higher than in many OECD countries. A&#13;
large proportion of students are in higher-cost vocational and technical schools (technikums) that are&#13;
training for skills no longer relevant for the economy. Student/teacher ratios are low relative to OECD&#13;
standards at all levels.&#13;
1.7    Teachers: There are almost six million teachers in the education system. Declines in student&#13;
enrollment in some sub-sectors and the rise in demand for new skills in others have implications for&#13;
future teacher supply, skill-mix, and deployment. Low student/teacher ratios are evident at all levels of&#13;
education. They are caused by the prevalence of labor intensive, face-to-face, oral approaches to teaching&#13;
and assessment. Lecture and note-taking predominate. Team-teaching and small group discussions are&#13;
rare. Library resources and the use of independent source materials are a fraction of the norm elsewhere.&#13;
Examinations and assessments tend to be oral. This type of pedagogy is not efficient and points to a need&#13;
to invest in new teaching methods and materials to make the pedagogical process more efficient and less&#13;
labor-intensive. Teacher salaries have lagged behind other sectors. The average teacher salary was 81&#13;
percent of the average industrial wage in 1980; by 1994 it had fallen to 66 percent. The salary of a&#13;
professor fell from 219 percent of industrial wage in 1987 to 62 percent in July of 1993. As a result the&#13;
better teachers and those with skills in high demand (foreign languages, economics, survey research) are&#13;
leaving the profession. However, despite salary instability, overall employment in compulsory and higher&#13;
education appears to have increased since 1991.&#13;
1.8    Management: During the Soviet regime, control by distant Moscow-based structures, segmented&#13;
sectoral ownership, norm-based financing, and the lack of adequate school based authority characterized&#13;
education management. Much change has occurred in the structure of educational governance over the&#13;
last three years. However, the sources of authority have been many, overlapping, and of varying&#13;
legitimacy. Regional and district authorities are now responsible for financing primary and secondary&#13;
education. In the past, federal authorities were responsible for providing the entire curriculum,&#13;
pedagogical materials and equipment, and their associated expenses. With the recent establishment of&#13;
federal, regional and school-defined curricula, local authorities are assuming new responsibilities and&#13;
expenditures in this area as well as for teacher supervision and in-service training, maintenance, and&#13;
budget management. All vocational and some technical schools are financed by the MGPE; some other&#13;
technical schools are financed by the relevant sectoral ministries. In an effort to adapt to emerging labor&#13;
markets, the regional role in the finance and management of vocational schools is expected to increase.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Education Innovation Project                                     Page 3&#13;
1.9    The MGPE and 21 different federal ministries finance and manage institutions of higher&#13;
education. At the same time, regional authorities are beginning partially to finance local higher education&#13;
institutions to meet the needs of regional industries, labor markets, and tax payers. The question of&#13;
which level of public authority should manage higher education is determined by the federal law on&#13;
higher and post graduate profession education. Entrance examinations to higher education are designed&#13;
and administered differently (mostly oral with no standardization) by each of the roughly nine departments&#13;
in each of the 535 higher education institutions scattered across the country. Education Research is under&#13;
the authority of the MGPE and the Russian Academy of Education.&#13;
1.10   Expenditure: Formal spending in Russia for social protection-' (9% of GDP) is significantly&#13;
lower than expenditure levels in Eastern Europe (averaging around 14 % of GDP), but higher than in most&#13;
countries at the comparable GDP per capita level. Russia devoted 7 percent of GDP to education in the&#13;
early 1970s. This declined to 3.8 percent in 1991, 3.4 percent in 1992, rose to 4.4 percent in 1994, and&#13;
then declined again to 3.4 percent in 1995. Education expenditure has been broadly protected during the&#13;
transition period although GDP share is below many OECD countries. Because GDP has declined&#13;
precipitously since 1991, real per student spending has declined. These declines were unevenly spread&#13;
across the system, higher for pre-school and compulsory education, lower for specialized secondary and&#13;
higher education. Moreover, differences in per pupil spending between the 89 regions of the Russian&#13;
Federation are increasing. In 1994, higher education accounted for 23% of total public educational&#13;
expenditures which was low compared to some OECD countries. Compulsory education at 50 percent&#13;
was low, especially given that only 38 percent was devoted to general education while 12 percent was&#13;
allocated to vocational education. Salary expenditures are financed with increasing difficulty while non-&#13;
salary items including textbooks, equipment, capital investments and repairs have received lower priority&#13;
B. Key Issues of Transition&#13;
1.11   Lessons from international research and experience on effective school systems underline the&#13;
importance of relevant curricula and teaching and learning materials, flexible teaching approaches that&#13;
develop critical thinking and problem solving, school based autonomy and accountability in resource&#13;
management and decision making. In the past, ideology and isolation kept the Russian education system&#13;
outside these trends. Under central planning, the Russian education system operated without adequate&#13;
incentives to encourage accountability for costs and managerial efficiency. Curricula emphasized&#13;
uniformity. Governance structures catered to distant, uncoordinated federal ministries rather than to local&#13;
labor markets and needs. There are different requirements for managing an education system to produce&#13;
graduates with the type of skills to cater to the needs of a market economy and a democratic civic culture.&#13;
Government has launched an ambitious reform program to respond to these new requirements. Financial&#13;
instability and decline during the transition coupled with the legacy of past assumptions, structures,&#13;
incentives, and attitudes have slowed on-going attempts at reform. Issues central to reform of education&#13;
in Russia are summarized below.&#13;
1.12   Governance: It is envisaged that the recent changes in the structure of the MGPE will encourage&#13;
the development of education sector policy and strategy in Russia and will create a national mechanism&#13;
to lead and coordinate more in-depth technical analysis, comprehensive strategic planning, and broad&#13;
1/    Including Social Insurance (pensions, unemployment benefits), family allowances and social assistance&#13;
programs but not subsidized housing and utilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                                                   Chapter I&#13;
public discussion and consensus for the reform of both compulsory and post-compulsory education.&#13;
1.13   Finance: The fiscal base of education is threatened because of the decline in public revenues for&#13;
education which has resulted in a steep reduction in per-student expenditures by educational level since&#13;
1991 together with an increase in costs, especially energy costs. The sector has coped with these&#13;
simultaneous expenditure decline and price increases by introducing guaranteed (protected) funding items:&#13;
wages, stipends, food, and utilities. Expenditures on items such as textbooks, equipment, capital&#13;
investments and repairs have received lower priority. Shortfalls in budgets have led to severe problems&#13;
with physical resources and school buildings are often inadequately heated and maintained. Further&#13;
reductions in expenditures on non-salary items would weaken educational effectiveness and diminish&#13;
quality. Financial shortages in the education sector have not yet resulted in major improvements in&#13;
efficiency. Student/teacher ratios remain low due to the labor-intensive, oral approaches to organizing&#13;
instruction and assessmenta'.&#13;
1.14   Equity: The emphasis on educational decentralization and diversity is creating greater inequities.&#13;
There are growing discrepancies in per pupil expenditures in compulsory education across and within the&#13;
89 regions in Russia. The existing system of education finance does not have explicit mechanisms for&#13;
compensatory funding of educational spending and redistribution of budget revenues between regions with&#13;
different fiscal bases. Consequently, variation in the access to good quality education is increasing.&#13;
1.15   Curicula and teaching methods are not yet fully responsive to the developing market economy&#13;
where a premium is placed on problem-solving, occupational flexibility, innovation and creativity in&#13;
teaching and learning and active participation in democracy. Incentives for teachers and managers to&#13;
learn new pedagogical or management skills are absent and this in turn encourages the perpetuation of&#13;
the rigid, hierarchical and inefficient system. However, in recent years there have been adjustments in&#13;
curricula accompanied by attempts to introduce choice in compulsory education. In short, there is a&#13;
growing internal potential for change in the education system which is hampered by a severe shortage of&#13;
funding for the development of curricular innovations and their dissemination.&#13;
1.16   Teachers As has been already noted, teachers have suffered badly in the transition by having&#13;
their salaries devalued and frequently paid several months in arrears while other job benefits (e.g.housing)&#13;
are also disappearing. In spite of notable loyalty and commitment to their chosen vocation, it is evident&#13;
that teachers are becoming increasingly demoralized. There is also concern about the quality of teacher&#13;
training which often permits entry to those with a low level of educational attainment and fails to preserve&#13;
professional standards through adequate retraining policies.&#13;
1.17   Examinations: As elsewhere, examinations in Russia strongly influence what is taught in schools&#13;
and, to a large extent, determine the opportunity for further study and employment. The current&#13;
mechanism for selection to higher education is inefficient and unfair. Entrance examinations are&#13;
administered differently by each department in each of 535 institutions scattered across the country. Since&#13;
there are about nine different departments in each higher education institution, there are in effect over&#13;
5000 different entrance examinations.  Students are required to appear in person.  In general,&#13;
examinations in all institutions are administered at about the same time thus preventing candidates from&#13;
2/ Teacher-student ratios vary from 1:8 to 1:16 for the primary and secondary education sectors and average&#13;
1:10 for higher education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Education Innovation Project                                    Page 5&#13;
applying to more than one program in a given year. Except for Russian and mathematics, examinations&#13;
are generally oral. Students have no guarantee that the level of difficulty of their test is equivalent to any&#13;
other test in the same field or whether scoring criteria are comparable. Tests are designed by isolated&#13;
tradition-bound faculty and departments which may have little understanding of the new knowledge and&#13;
skill requirements of emerging labor markets. In a market economy, the pressure to enter higher&#13;
education will increase, particularly in fields of high demand. In these circumstances, the need for an&#13;
efficient, high quality, and fair method of selection to higher education will increase.&#13;
1.18   Educational Materials: A survey in schools which was carried out as part of project preparation&#13;
reveals problems of supply, "age" and content of books. The implication of the survey is that over the&#13;
next one to two years, textbooks will have to be replaced on a mass scale throughout the Russian&#13;
Federation(RF) rather than at the normal rate of 25 % per annum. The absence of competition and of&#13;
information hampers the development of new textbook content to meet new curriculum objectives and to&#13;
support economic and social reform. The current estimated need for the publication of new textbooks,&#13;
new editions and reprints of existing textbooks is difficult to estimate. However from existing data on&#13;
books supplied through the MOE in former years and the under-funding of the system since 1993 there&#13;
is now an estimated need for up to 400 million textbooks if the system is to be supplied to the specified&#13;
level. At current prices this would cost upwards of $500 million equivalent. There remains a lack of&#13;
clarity between various levels of government (and the schools) on textbook funding. In addition there&#13;
is, in some cases, a separation of the final funding agencies (the oblasts) from control over contractual&#13;
arrangements with the publishers and distributors. Placing orders through the MGPE, whether or not&#13;
against the Ministry of Finance (MOF) debits, is costly and inefficient. Over 80 % of textbook production&#13;
is still handled by the State monopoly publisher, Prosvescheniyie. There is a resulting inadequacy of&#13;
choice and sometimes of quality of books in the school system. The continuance of this monopoly, in&#13;
part dictated by the sheer size of the market and the working capital needs implied, is an obstacle to the&#13;
development of a full market-oriented system. These factors discourage the further development of a&#13;
potentially healthy private sector educational publishing industry. The current financing gap for textbooks&#13;
is only marginally assisted by emergency funds from the MOF (for the poorer regions) and is&#13;
interconnected with the MGPE's wish to reduce past indebtedness.&#13;
C. Higher Education Sector&#13;
1.19   The Higher Education sector is under pressure because of the general economic situation, the&#13;
reduction in federal budget financing and the need to modernize the curricular content and teaching&#13;
methods of HEIs. Important indications of efforts to adjust to the changing needs of the general public&#13;
for education and the needs of employers for human resources are changes in distribution of admissions&#13;
and graduations by areas of specialization, increase in the number of new private colleges which provide&#13;
training in the most wanted areas, changes in standards and the content of education. Some changes&#13;
occurred in the system of governance and management of HEIs, reflected in the consolidation of the&#13;
central structure of higher education management, the increase of academic freedom, and the introduction&#13;
of the system of election of rectors. The system responded to reduced federal budget funding by drawing&#13;
increasingly on the extra-budgetary and local budget sources. However, the reports on the Governance,&#13;
Management and Funding of Higher Education which were completed as part of the project preparation&#13;
process, demonstrate that the sector continues to suffer from a lack of clearly defined responsibilities&#13;
between governing agencies together with an incomplete legal framework, insufficient transparency in&#13;
the allocation and use of public funding and a need to modernize Higher Education course content and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

set standards for the teaching of the social sciences (particularly economics).&#13;
D. Government Objectives and Strategy&#13;
1.20   The Government is committed to strengthening the education system to ensure that all children&#13;
have access to high quality education so that each will have the opportunity to participate fully in and&#13;
contribute to Russia's economic and social development. Achieving this objective requires an education&#13;
system that is more flexible, more responsive to market signals, and more efficient in its use of resources&#13;
than at present. The strategy for education is embodied in the 1992 Education Law and the 1993 Federal&#13;
Program  for Educational Development.  The 1992 legislation emphasized curricular diversity,&#13;
decentralized finance and management of compulsory education to the regions; and diversified sources&#13;
of education finance including the legalization of private schools and institutions. The main intention&#13;
of the 1993 federal education reform were to:&#13;
*     ensure implementation of the legal and regulatory enactments to make the 1992 education law&#13;
effective;&#13;
*     develop regional capacity to finance and manage the education system;&#13;
i     adapt curricular content and pedagogy to respond to the needs of the individual, society, and&#13;
emerging local labor markets;&#13;
e     diversify the types of educational institutions and sources of finance, especially private sources,&#13;
in particular user charges in higher education and private sector participation at all levels; and&#13;
*     develop mechanisms to monitor the quality of educational inputs and outputs and to enforce&#13;
educational standards, in particular the establishment of a Federal Testing and Assessment Center&#13;
and development of Education Statistical Indicators to set national standards for educational inputs&#13;
and performance, assess students/graduates learning achievement and skills, license teachers, and&#13;
accredit and evaluate institutions and programs.&#13;
1.21   Since 1993, considerable progress has been made. A gradual decentralization of governance and&#13;
management functions has been underway. New types of education are emerging; elements of new&#13;
funding principles are being discussed. Renewal of the content of education is accelerating. Work has&#13;
been started to revise minimum standards for compulsory education. Direct ministerial administrative&#13;
control of the education system is declining. Institutional autonomy is increasing in areas of curriculum&#13;
development, selection of teaching methods, and budget management.&#13;
1.22  In August 1996, there was a reorganization of the Government in which the former State&#13;
Committee for Higher Education was combined with the former Ministry of Education into the new&#13;
MGPE. This reorganization will mean that policy making for the education sector will be unified and&#13;
strengthened. A Deputy Minister with special responsibility for the provision of textbooks and other&#13;
educational materials on a federal level was appointed.&#13;
1.23   Also in August, 1996, the Government introduced a new law on Higher and Post-Graduate&#13;
Education which clarified some ownership rights, and provided for tax-free and freehold use of land by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Education Innovation Project                                     Page 7&#13;
HEIs. User fees for Higher Education are permitted for up to 25 % of students in public HEIs. Selection&#13;
criteria for these students are different from those who do not pay for tuition. The most capable students&#13;
theoretically can be enrolled in programs financed by public funding and so an implicit subsidy for lower&#13;
income students is in place.&#13;
1.24   However, the lack of clarity about federal, regional and sub regional roles together with the&#13;
diffusion of responsibilities between federal and local authorities are weakening the capacity to drive&#13;
initiatives forward. Areas requiring continuing further reform are:&#13;
*     The financing system will need to be reformed for all levels of education, to ensure transparency,&#13;
sustainability, responsiveness to changing student demands and enhanced competition among both&#13;
old and new educational institutions.&#13;
*     Governance capacity at all levels will need to be strengthened by the introduction of measures&#13;
to consolidate the education system and to preserve consistency. Policy making capacity should&#13;
be supported through the development of educational statistics and indicators and through the&#13;
promotion of transparent financing systems. Both of these measures will lead to greater public&#13;
accountability.&#13;
*     It will be necessary to develop the accountability of compulsory education  at local levels,&#13;
including choice of curricula and educational materials. Work has been started to revise minimum&#13;
standards for compulsory education. However, lack of funding has impeded progress in this&#13;
area. There are still no approved policy guidelines to increase authority for regional governments&#13;
for curriculum and choice of textbooks.&#13;
*     The most important objectives for Vocational and Higher Education are improved quality, greater&#13;
flexibility, more involvement of regional governments and the reduction of administrative over&#13;
head costs. It is also essential to integrate better research with education. The most capable&#13;
students theoretically can be enrolled in programs financed by public funding and so an implicit&#13;
subsidy for lower income students is in place. However, there is still no system of student loans&#13;
or special supplements for low income students.&#13;
Achieving these objectives will involve considerable restructuring and consolidation over a long period&#13;
of time.&#13;
1.25   The proposed project, through its focus on the promotion of efficiencies in the teaching of social&#13;
sciences in participating HEIs and on the revision of minimum standards for compulsory education&#13;
together with the development a national program of textbook publishing reform, would constitute a&#13;
strategic first step on the part of the Bank to support key reforms in the sector.&#13;

II. BANK STRATEGY AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS BANK EXPERIENCE&#13;
A. Bank Strategy&#13;
2.1    The objectives of the proposed Education Innovation Project (EIP) are consistent with the current&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy for Russia (October 1996) and with the framework of action envisaged for&#13;
the education sector in the Social Sector Strategy Note which would be to promote the:&#13;
(a)    clarification of responsibilities for policy development and implementation at various&#13;
levels of federal and regional government;&#13;
(b)    development of financing mechanisms,like capitation, which would relieve underfunding&#13;
in poorer regions and in non-salary expenditures, and help to link content of education&#13;
more closely to student needs;&#13;
(c)   development of curricula, teacher training, career counselling, learning materials and&#13;
other support systems more in line with the needs of the market economy and a&#13;
democratic society; and&#13;
(d)    consolidation of facilities in higher education through the establishment of demand driven&#13;
mechanisms. Meeting these reform objectives will require assistance to: (i) strengthen&#13;
policy making and strategic planning at the federal level and (ii) to stabilize education&#13;
finance, rationalize expenditure allocation, support new knowledge and skill development,&#13;
and rationalize institutional structures and functions at the regional, district, and&#13;
municipal levels.&#13;
2.2    The broad objective of education lending to Russia is to support Government efforts to: (a)&#13;
maintain essential service levels, (b) increase the efficiency and equity of service delivery, (c) develop&#13;
appropriate knowledge and skills critical for economic transition and social development, and (d) ensure&#13;
the financial sustainability of the education system.&#13;
2.3    There are currently three projects with education and training components in the lending program&#13;
that support these objectives. The Management and Financial Training (Ln. 3824-Ru.) (MFT) and the&#13;
Employment Services and Social Protection (Ln. 8822-Ru.) (ESSP) projects address the development of&#13;
human capital in Russia and emphasize adult training in short-cycle courses, where labor market needs&#13;
could be readily identified. The MFT Project introduced the concept of demand-led training through the&#13;
creation of the National Training Foundation (NTF) to define training strategies, identify priorities, and&#13;
allocate training funds on a competitive basis. The third project, the Community Social Infrastructure&#13;
Project (Ln. 4009-Ru.) (CSIP), which was approved by the Board in April 1996, addresses urgent social&#13;
expenditure issues including education. It includes compulsory schools as a high priority for project&#13;
finance and focuses on the need to rehabilitate and improve school facilities. It is a pilot project in two&#13;
regions, with the expectation of eventual replication on a wider basis through further Bank lending&#13;
projects or Government financing.&#13;
2.4    These three projects reflect the alternative approaches to project design the Bank is pursuing in&#13;
social sector lending in Russia. These include: (a) institution building projects, (b) demonstration projects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Education Innovation Project                                   Page 9&#13;
at the regional level, and (c) development of federal/local systems of financial transfers. The ESSP and&#13;
MFT projects are institution building activities, although they both directly deliver programs and services&#13;
too. Both of these projects will provide practical experience on what kinds of institutional structures and&#13;
implementation arrangements work in Russia. The proposed Education Innovation Project would build&#13;
directly on the experience of the MFT by utilizing the National Training Foundation as an organization&#13;
to administer this project. The CSIP is a replicable, demonstration type activity and will provide an&#13;
information base on approaches to improving services at the regional level.&#13;
2.5    The Education Innovation Project would be the first Bank financed project devoted exclusively&#13;
to the education sector and will build upon the knowledge and experience gained in the previous Bank&#13;
financed social sector projects in Russia. It constitutes a limited first step in revitalizing the education&#13;
sector through the creation of an Innovation Fund (IF) to reform the teaching of social sciences and&#13;
through the reform of the current textbook publishing system.&#13;
B. Lessons from Experience&#13;
2.6   Past Bank experience indicates that effective implementation and longer-term sustainability of&#13;
education projects depend strongly on the improvement of educational management at all governance&#13;
levels as well as on the establishment of effective systems to manage sector and school level information,&#13;
project monitoring information, and procurement and delivery activities. In the Europe and Central Asia&#13;
(ECA) Region, projects in Hungary and Romania address many of the same issues and objectives as the&#13;
proposed Project and offer lessons for project design in the transition economies.&#13;
2.7    Higher Education Innovation Fund: The Bank has considerable experience in the use of&#13;
innovation type funds within higher education projects in Hungary, Indonesia, Tunisia, Brazil, Argentina.&#13;
Generic experience with funds indicates the importance of: (a) careful phasing to match the pace and&#13;
scale of the project; (b) building management capability; (c) building ownership and commitment through&#13;
beneficiary participation in the design of the project; (d) flexibility to respond to change at federal and&#13;
local level. One lesson of both Bank and European Union Education projects in Central and Eastern&#13;
Europe which is particularly relevant to the present project is that incentives, rather than direct control,&#13;
are the key to reform. Core budget funding, to be distributed to higher education institutions under an&#13;
objective and transparent system, encourages responsiveness to the changing market demand and provides&#13;
an ongoing incentive for efficiency improvement.&#13;
2.8    The Hungary Human Resources Project (Ln. 3313-HU, FY91) provided discretionary investment&#13;
funding to individual institutions through three competitive rounds between competing Higher Education&#13;
Institutes and launched a large number of new educational programs, including specific curricula and&#13;
changed teaching methods. However, the impact of the project was weakened through fragmentation of&#13;
much of the funding across institutions, resulting in small funding amounts and limited impact. In&#13;
addition, there was insufficient protection for preserving the integrity of the peer review process for&#13;
evaluating funding proposals. Guidelines relating to conflicts of interest were not well developed or&#13;
monitored nor were evaluation procedures designed to discourage wholesale reallocation of funding&#13;
recommendations, with the result that peer review had too little impact on decision making. These issues&#13;
have been addressed in the design of the procedures in the proposed Innovation Fund where the size of&#13;
the grants would be of sufficient magnitude to act as a catalyst to some reform and where the design of&#13;
the eligibility criteria and conditions of award, will be the subject of ongoing scrutiny by Expert&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 10                                                                          Chapter II&#13;
Committees comprising at least one international expert as well as a broad range of Russian expertise.&#13;
2.9   School Textbook Reform Component: The textbook component of the Romania Education&#13;
project (Ln. 3724-RO, FY93) has similar broad objectives to the textbook component in this proposed&#13;
project, e.g. to reform textbook quality and to encourage private publishers to compete for the&#13;
development of new textbooks. The project encountered some initial problems related to the existing&#13;
monopoly of state publishers; the problem was addressed by privatizing state publishers and then&#13;
allowing them to compete for contracts on the same level as other private publishers which is a feature&#13;
of this proposed project&#13;
2.10   There are also several generic lessons from implementing Bank financed projects in Russia.&#13;
These include the importance of: (a) strong Government ownership; (b) consistent counterparts with&#13;
authority for preparation; (c) inter-ministerial coordination; (d) including local consultants and institutions&#13;
in all stages of project preparation; (e) setting up Project Implementation Units (PIUs) at an early stage&#13;
with experienced advisors to facilitate efficient project management; and (f) early detailed attention to&#13;
procurement and other implementation issues.&#13;
2.11   The proposed Project has closely followed each of the above generic lessons: (a) the Government&#13;
established a Working Group as the Bank's counterpart in project preparation; (b) the preparation process&#13;
has benefited from the same Government officials working as counterparts with the Bank and also from&#13;
the same team of experts working for the Bank in Russia; (c) the Working Group has been chaired by&#13;
the Ministry of Economy (MOE) and has had representatives from the MGPE and the MOF as well as&#13;
from potential beneficiaries; (d) preparation of this project to date has been highly participatory and the&#13;
fmal stages of project design were agreed in a workshop format where all counterparts and potential&#13;
beneficiaries were present; and (e) recent experience with the County Portfolio Performance Review&#13;
(CPPR) has been taken into account, specifically the lessons relating the need to strengthen institutional&#13;
capacity to manage projects. The Government has advised that the NTF would administer the project.&#13;
The project would therefore benefit from the NTF's experience with the Bank's procedures, including&#13;
handling of procurement and disbursement.&#13;

III. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION&#13;
A. Project Background&#13;
3.1    Building on the dialogue of the last few years, and on previous Bank experience with educational&#13;
projects, the World Bank team, together with Russian colleagues developed a project which would impose&#13;
modest elements of reform and serve as the basis for future lending in the sector. The proposed project&#13;
would pilot reforms and would include a Higher Education component with a demand responsive&#13;
emphasis on improving social science teaching 3' through the creation of an Innovation Fund, and a&#13;
School Textbook Reform component which would support better quality and choice of textbooks. The&#13;
rationale for including these two components is that the Government of Russia (GOR) has consistently&#13;
requested support in these areas over several years of dialogue with the Bank and during two workshops&#13;
and these components would represent a first step on which future lending operations could be built.&#13;
B. Project Objectives&#13;
3.2   The objectives of the project are to:&#13;
(a)   improve, in selected Higher Education Institutions, the guality and quantity of social&#13;
science education and encourage better governance systems and efficiency in the use of&#13;
resources; and&#13;
(b)   improve the gualitv and availability of school textbooks as a major contribution to&#13;
educational reform.&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
3.3   The proposed project would have three components: (a) Higher Education Innovation Fund; (b)&#13;
School Textbook Reform; and (c) Pilot Textbook Procurement Fund.&#13;
Part A - Higher Education Innovation Fund Component ($50 million)&#13;
3.4   This component would encourage the reform of selected Higher Education Institutes and would&#13;
demonstrate how to effect considerable savings to the federal budget without loss of quality by, for&#13;
example, amalgamating non-efficient institutions; improving teaching methods; encouraging reduced&#13;
teacher-student ratios, strengthening social science education, promoting greater efficiency in use of public&#13;
funds at HEI level through increased accountability and transparency.&#13;
3.5   The Higher Education system in Russia is a major consumer of resources and improved&#13;
governance and management of resources would significantly improve the quality of Higher Education&#13;
and use of resources in the sector. Social sciences teaching, as is currently understood in OECD&#13;
economies, is in urgent need of improvement and development, reflecting its absence in former times.&#13;
Target support for innovation in the content, planning finance and management of higher education&#13;
reflects the political prominence and importance of this sub-sector and its role in providing trained human&#13;
3/     See Annex A for definition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 12                                                                       Chapter III&#13;
capital for the transition.&#13;
3.6   It was agreed at an early stage in project preparation with representatives of the GOR that the&#13;
focus of the Bank's intervention would be on the improvement of the quality of education within social&#13;
sciences and on the reform of the governance and management of HEIs. This decision was made by the&#13;
Government because social sciences are seen as key disciplines in need of in the transition to a market&#13;
economy and in education for a democratic society. It was recognized that these disciplines need a great&#13;
deal of development in qualitative terms. There was also a wish to improve the governance and&#13;
management of HEIs to benefit all aspects of higher education.&#13;
3.7   This component would establish an Innovation Fund focussing on international best practice&#13;
where applicable and on the development of social sciences and governance and management reform.&#13;
The IF would offer partly repayable grants based on the result of a competitive process between higher&#13;
education institutions. Conditions of application and selection criteria would be publicized and awards&#13;
would be determined in a transparent manner.&#13;
3.8   The Innovation Fund would be a non-profit making, grant dispersing body in which the main&#13;
stakeholder is the higher education sector of Russia which is fully represented at all levels of management&#13;
of the IF. Other major stakeholders (MGPE, MOE and MOF) are represented in the governance of the&#13;
IF. Grants from the Innovation Fund are to be used in a manner consistent with agreed principles (see&#13;
paras. 3.13, 3.14).&#13;
3.9   There would be three "windows" of support within the IF. Each of these windows addresses&#13;
certain aspects of reform in HE. Programs supported within these windows would not be considered as&#13;
separate. They would be complementary to each other and mutually supportive. Each of the three&#13;
windows would support sub-projects which would have a different focus and target group: Window I&#13;
focuses on sub-projects to improve the teaching of social sciences linked to improved governance and&#13;
efficiency of management in universities which major in teaching in these subjects; Window 2 focuses&#13;
on sub-projects to improve governance and efficiency of management and is available to selected HEIs;&#13;
and Window 3 focuses on sub-projects to improve academic linkages.&#13;
Window 1:   Social Science Institutions Capacity Building. This Window would support Social&#13;
Science Development Schemes (SSDSs) by partially repayable grants allocated on a&#13;
competitive selection basis for improvements in the teaching of social sciences linked to&#13;
reform of governance and management at the institutional level. Up to 70% of the total&#13;
fund would be allocated to this window.&#13;
Window 2:   Governance Reform. This Window would support Structural Reform Schemes (SRSs)&#13;
by partially repayable grants allocated on a competitive selection basis for governance&#13;
reform efforts. The proportion of the total fund allocated to this window would be up&#13;
to 22% of the total fund.&#13;
Window 3:   Social Sciences Academic Support. This window  would support Social Sciences&#13;
Academic Award Schemes (SSASSs), academic co-operation and co-ordination of&#13;
professional activity designed to support the development of structural reform and the&#13;
social sciences (seminars, visiting scholarships, the exchange of professorships, scientific&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Education Innovation Project                                Page 13&#13;
journals, professional associations, the development of networks and lateral connections&#13;
in the social sciences supported in the project). The amount allocated to this window is&#13;
not to exceed 8% of the total amount of the fund.&#13;
3.10   The PIU would invite applications for partial repayable grants to finance SSDSs and SRSs,&#13;
priority would be given to schemes which contain the following features:&#13;
*     institutional development: the extent to which the schemes contribute to or require positive reform&#13;
of management and/or administrative structures and procedures;&#13;
*     devolved decision-making within the HEI could be a feature of each SSDS and SRS submitted.&#13;
This might show the extent to which the SSDSs and SRSs provide incentives and opportunities&#13;
for junior teaching staff to engage in effective decision-making;&#13;
*     efficient funding formulae: illustrating how the schemes allow or promote the development of&#13;
funding formulae (for example, staff salaries, library resources, course delivery) which are based&#13;
on measures of output;&#13;
*     basis for future reform and for the future academic development within the institution should be&#13;
present in any scheme;&#13;
*     flexibility which recognizes not only the numerical variable of supply and demand but also the&#13;
changing content of any discipline should be evident within the scheme;&#13;
v     a review of teaching methods, including a review of staff/student ratios and the use of appropriate&#13;
technology, (and its influence on the HEI's physical resources) would form an essential element&#13;
in a successful scheme.&#13;
3.11  It is anticipated that for Window 1, grants would range from US$ 80,000 to US$ 3.0 million;&#13;
approximately 10 to 15 of these awards would be between US$ 2.0 and 3.0 million and the remainder&#13;
of smaller size. For Window 2, it is anticipated that there would be about 55 awards with an average&#13;
value of US$ 150,000 and for Window 3 approximately 50 awards of up to US$ 100,000.&#13;
3.12  Implementation aspects of the IF: The Innovation Fund would be administered by the National&#13;
Training Foundation which would act as a PIU, empowered by the GOR to administer the Loan in&#13;
accordance with the objectives of the project (para. 4.3). The operation of the Innovation Fund would&#13;
be governed by the Board of Directors of the NTF which would represent the interests of the&#13;
stakeholders: that is, the MGPE, the MOF, the MOE and the academic community. Expert Committees&#13;
from appropriate disciplines would be established for the purpose of assessing and recommending awards&#13;
to the Board of Directors of the NTF. The Board of Directors would, inter alia, confirm proposals to&#13;
amend the operating principles of the IF; and confirm that awards made are consistent with the operating&#13;
principles of the IF and Loan Agreement. Procedures for the operations of the Fund would be agreed&#13;
and incorporated into Volume III of the Operations Manual of the NTF. The reorganized staffing plan&#13;
of the NTF would make available such technical advice and assistance as may be required to carry out&#13;
these extended functions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 14                                                                        Chapter III&#13;
3.13 The essential award criteria to be applied to proposals from HEIs are listed in Annex A. The&#13;
objectives of the award criteria concern the worthwhileness of the proposed scheme against such measures&#13;
as: innovativeness, efficiency, transportability, value for money, additionality, market relevance. It is&#13;
anticipated that expenditures which would attract funding from the IF for improvements in the quality of&#13;
teaching in economics and social sciences would include: program development costs; consultancy&#13;
services; development of new textbooks; accreditation and certification arrangements; improvement of&#13;
libraries and of information technology facilities; staff training and retraining; and research expenditure.&#13;
3.14   Annex A contains additional detailed information on the IF, including proposed administrative&#13;
arrangements. Eligibility criteria for participating institutions, numbers and membership of the Expert&#13;
Committees, content of application documentation and award criteria were confirmed during appraisal.&#13;
The Applications Procedures Documentation, including eligibility criteria for the selection of HEIs and&#13;
draft Agreement between the participating HEIs and the MOF containing, inter alia, the cost recovery&#13;
scheme have been reviewed and will be finalized for inclusion in the Operations Manual (para. 4.6).&#13;
Part B - School Textbook Reform Component (US$20 million)&#13;
3.15   This component would be a modest step in addressing the complexities of supply and demand&#13;
in the textbook market in Russia. It would improve the quality and supply of textbooks through (a) the&#13;
provision of training and equipment for both the MOE and regional educational administrations to&#13;
strengthen educational standards and create new textbook titles; and (b) the establishment of electronic&#13;
information and book ordering systems which would provide equity of access to timely information on&#13;
new and improved textbooks throughout the RF for schools, parents and students.&#13;
Specific Project Objectives:&#13;
i     To establish a logical system of authority, responsibility and accountability of, respectively, the&#13;
Federal and Regional Education Authorities concerning the quality, choice, purchase and supply&#13;
of textbooks and other educational literature for second cycle schools;&#13;
*     To establish a system for textbook quality monitoring including Federal Set renewal and&#13;
replacement and extension consistent with increased choice of books and other educational&#13;
options;&#13;
*     To establish a nationwide market information infrastructure that would ensure directed and&#13;
rational decision-making in textbook ordering together with real time interaction between&#13;
customers and producers;&#13;
*     To train education managers and practitioners in the use of the textbook ordering and information&#13;
system.&#13;
3.16    These objectives would be accomplished through four sub-components:&#13;
Subcomponent 1: Textbook Quality Improvement&#13;
3.17   This subcomponent would finance:&#13;

(a)   the establishment of a valid set of National Education Standards and the testing of these&#13;
Standards as the essential long-term basis for the creation of the "Federal Set" of&#13;
textbooks; and&#13;
(b)   the evaluation and validation of textbooks and other educational materials through&#13;
structural, managerial and technical reform of the Federal Expert Council.  The&#13;
Government has agreed in principle with the Bank's recommendations on the&#13;
restructuring of the Federal Expert Council.&#13;
Subcomponent Two: Renewal of the Federal List&#13;
3.18  (a)    This subcomponent would finance an analysis of the Federal List of textbooks and&#13;
educational literature recommended for use in schools. This analysis would identify the&#13;
courses and disciplines currently not supported by textbooks or which urgently require&#13;
updating. It would permit re-evaluation of older textbooks and their possible exclusion&#13;
from the List as well as those which fail to meet modern requirements or are not&#13;
supported by the necessary teachers' and optional materials or do not comprise a&#13;
methodologically complete set within a discipline; and&#13;
(b)    This subcomponent would address the need for "new generation" textbooks through the&#13;
application of grants on a competitive selection basis for manuscript development by&#13;
authors and for pre-press and promotional/informational work by publishers. The&#13;
selection procedures and contract arrangements for the award of grants have been&#13;
reviewed and will be finalized for inclusion into the Operations Manual (para. 4.6).&#13;
Subcomponent Three: Textbook Information System&#13;
3.19   This subcomponent has two main elements aimed at improving textbook choice and would&#13;
finance:&#13;
(a)    a single database of all relevant educational books in print for the Russian school system&#13;
and the provision of an annually updated "Textbooks-in-Print" catalog in traditional and&#13;
electronic formats; and&#13;
(b)   the design and installation of a screen based information delivery service, initially for&#13;
textbooks and educational materials, covering the entire Federation at least to the level&#13;
of each Raion Education Department. The TOR for the feasibility study and systems plan&#13;
have been reviewed and will be finalized for inclusion in the Operations Manual (para.&#13;
4.6).&#13;
Sub-component Four: Training&#13;
3.20   This subcomponent would support training programs for regional and local education&#13;
administrators in new market-led textbook ordering and information systems.&#13;
3.21   Annex B contains an analysis of the reform and development needs for school textbooks in Russia&#13;
&#13;

together with additional detailed information on this component.&#13;
Part C - Pilot Textbook Procurement Fund Component (US$10.0 million)&#13;
3.22   The objective of the fund would be to assist selected oblasts to obtain textbooks in a manner&#13;
which would contribute towards: (a) overcoming barriers to entry by assuring payments to publishers and&#13;
by structuring payments in a manner that addresses working capital requirements; (b) the more&#13;
competitive selection of textbooks and the eventual demonopolization of the textbook publishing industry;&#13;
(c) speeding up the development and selection of new, more appropriate texts for secondary schools; and&#13;
(d) the creation of a sustainable system of funding for textbook supply for the secondary education&#13;
system.&#13;
3.23   School textbooks and learning materials would be procured through the Pilot Textbook&#13;
Procurement Fund. The MOF would on-lend the funds to participating oblasts with repayment to the&#13;
MOF through an agent bank. This would establish a revolving fund for future on-lending to oblasts by&#13;
the MOF. Annex C contains, inter alia, further details about this component. The procedure for the&#13;
selection of the regions and the on-lending arrangements including procedures for the future operation&#13;
of the revolving fund have been reviewed and will be finalized for inclusion in the Operations Manual&#13;
(para 4.6).&#13;
D. Environmental Aspects&#13;
3.24   This is a category "C" project. The proposed project has a focus on the reform of social science&#13;
teaching in Higher Education Institutions and on the improvement of textbook choice and quality to&#13;
include the development of new titles and selection processes. No adverse environmental consequences&#13;
are anticipated.&#13;
E. Participation, Poverty and Impact on Women&#13;
Participation&#13;
3.25    During the preparation of the Higher Education component over 130 individuals, including&#13;
students, were interviewed in a range of Higher Education Institutions. Equally, during project&#13;
preparation, numerous surveys and studies were carried out in a range of oblasts from the Far East to&#13;
European Russia to determine the needs of local administrations and parents groups for new and better&#13;
textbooks. Feedback from the surveys and interviews was used for project design. Project preparation&#13;
was highly participatory. Two residential workshops were held, one at project identification stage and&#13;
the other during the pre-appraisal mission. Approximately 60 key stakeholders from Moscow and the&#13;
Regions attended each workshop. In addition, there were numerous working groups composed of&#13;
potential beneficiaries whose recommendations about key sector issues were also factored into project&#13;
design. Competitive processes in both textbook selection and by the HEIs will ensure that the project&#13;
would remain relevant to the needs of the education sector during implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Russian Federation: Education Innovation Project                               Page 17&#13;
Poverty&#13;
3.26  There is no overt focus on poverty in the proposed project. However, by improving the human&#13;
capital stock which will be necessary for sustainable long term growth, investment in education does&#13;
contribute to poverty alleviation.&#13;
Impact on Women&#13;
3.27   Access to education in Russia is not denied to any individual regardless of gender or of ethnic&#13;
background. However, the proposed project would help to ensure that access to high quality educational&#13;
materials and entry to HEIs is made available to all individuals in spite of geographical or material&#13;
disadvantages.&#13;

IV. PROJECT STATUS, ADMINISTRATION, EVALUATION AND SUPERVISION&#13;
A. Status of Project Preparation&#13;
4.1    Early establishment of an Education Working Group and support given to the Group by the MOF&#13;
has allowed the project to reach an advanced stage of preparation. Additionally, two Japanese financed&#13;
PHRD Grants (Grant TF023070 dated September 30, 1993, administrated by the World Bank and Grant&#13;
TF029679, dated October 18, 1996, administrated by the MOF) have advanced the process. Funds from&#13;
the Grants, included the preparation of an education sector study (Russia: Education in Transition,&#13;
December 1995) and its dissemination workshop, which in particular, helped to strengthen the overall&#13;
policy dialogue and working relationships with the MGPE, MOF, and other education agencies. In&#13;
addition, detailed preparation studies were produced which form the basis of project design. Recently,&#13;
another very productive two-day participatory workshop was held during the pre-appraisal mission. This&#13;
workshop was attended by about 60 participants, representing the MOF, MGPE, MOE, the Duma&#13;
Education Committee, Rectors of Universities, Representatives of Regional Governments, Publishers, the&#13;
Education Working Group, and World Bank (WB) staff. The workshop resulted in, inter alia, a review&#13;
and refinement of the design of the components of the project and proposed financing and&#13;
implementations arrangements.&#13;
4.2   To further advance project preparation, a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) was approved on&#13;
April 26, 1997 in the amount of US$1.0 million to support, inter alia, the following essential preparatory&#13;
activities: Part A: (i) public information about the availability of Project funds, aimed at potentially&#13;
eligible HEIs in numerous regions of the Russian Federation; (ii) a pre-qualification exercise among HEIs&#13;
which would also assist with Grant Application Procedures through workshops and training; and (iii)&#13;
selection of members for the Expert Committees so that these committees would be in place, to begin the&#13;
process of awarding grants. Part B: (i) analysis of the current position on National Standards and Tests;&#13;
(ii) early development of principles and functions of the Federal Expert Council (FEC) to assist with&#13;
eventual restructuring of the FEC under the Project; (iii) an analysis of the Federal List and the selection&#13;
procedures for recipients of grants under the Project (authors and publishers) for the development of new&#13;
textbooks; (iv) initial data collection for educational materials catalog; and (v) a feasibility study to carry&#13;
out design of the computerized textbook information network. The appointment of additional staff to the&#13;
NTF to manage the project, technical assistance to strengthen organizational arrangements, and the cost&#13;
of essential administration costs would be funded from the PPF.&#13;
B. Project Administration&#13;
Project Administration&#13;
4.3   The NTF would administer the Project on behalf of the MOF. It would be responsible for&#13;
ensuring that the Agreement between the Government and the WB would be carried out in an efficient&#13;
and effective manner and would ensure a common and consistent approach regarding the implementation&#13;
of the project by all participating entities. The NTF would act on behalf of the MOF in all routine&#13;
matters pertaining to the administration of the project. It would, inter alia, act as the secretariat of the&#13;
Expert Committees, administer the Special Account, manage and monitor all procurement activities&#13;
including the signing of contracts (HEIs and Regions may be authorized to sign for tax exemption&#13;
purposes, etc.), submit requests for authorized payments and withdrawals from the Loan proceeds for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

consolidation and for transmission of all reports and other applicable correspondence to the WB.&#13;
4.4   The NTF was originally developed with financing for the Bank's Management and Training&#13;
Project (Loan No. 3824-RU dated April 25, 1995) with co-financing from the Swiss Government. It was&#13;
established under a Founding Agreement, dated September 7, 1994, as a non-governmental, non-profit&#13;
organization and was registered by the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation on September 29,&#13;
1994 (Registration No. YuR-8)]. Its activities are governed by the Russian Federation laws; Russia's&#13;
inter-governmental agreements; the Founding Agreement and Charter; and the Foundation's internal&#13;
regulations, which have been reviewed by WB staff and found satisfactory. The NTF's original mandate&#13;
under the Management and Training Project is not expected to be affected by its role in the administration&#13;
of this project.&#13;
4.5    Key staff of the NTF required to assist the Executive Director in the administration of this project&#13;
are as follows: for Part A of the project: an Innovation Fund Senior Program Officer and three (3)&#13;
Program Officers; for Parts B and C of the project: a Senior Program Officer and three (3) Program&#13;
Officers. Also assistance would be provided by a Finance Officer and a Procurement Officer. Annex&#13;
D contains details of the NTF organizational arrangements. The Government has confirmed that: (a)&#13;
NTF would be legally authorized to administer the project and would present the draft agreement between&#13;
the MOF and NTF (for review by the WB) by not later than September 1997; and (b) MOF and WB&#13;
agreed on: (i) the NTF's organizational arrangements; it's terms of reference; and staffing; and (ii) that&#13;
the WB would be consulted on any changes in the organization that could affect timely implementation,&#13;
including any changes in the key staff of the NTF. A Condition of Loan Effectiveness would be that&#13;
the NTF would be fully operational which would include the legal establishment and authorization by the&#13;
MOF for the NTF to administer the project on MOF's behalf and appointment of the key staff (i.e., the&#13;
NTF Coordination Agreement has been duly executed by the Borrower and NTF).&#13;
4.6   The NTF would be responsible for modifying the existing NTF Operational Manual and&#13;
developing Volume III pertaining to the proposed project, containing eligibility criteria and appraisal,&#13;
approval and supervision rules and procedures for the grants and reimbursable programs, as well as other&#13;
administrative rules to be followed by the NTF in the carrying out of the project. Modifications to the&#13;
existing NTF Operational Manual reflecting changes required for this proposed project were reviewed.&#13;
Further review of, inter alia, the Sub-loan and Sub-project agreements as contained in Volume III would&#13;
be undertaken and would again be reviewed by the WB. In agreement with the WB, the Manual would&#13;
be updated by the NTF as may be deemed appropriate during the implementation of the project. A&#13;
Condition of Loan Effectiveness would be the adoption of the Operational Manual by the NTF.&#13;
C. Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
Project Monitoring&#13;
4.7    Annex E contains the key Performance Monitoring Indicators to be used in the monitoring and&#13;
evaluation of the project. Agreement has been reached on the indicators and methods to be used for the&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of the proposed project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 20                                                                       Chapter IV&#13;
Quarterly Reports&#13;
4.8    Quarterly progress reports would be submitted to the WB by the NTF. Each participating agency&#13;
of the project would prepare its own report for consolidation by the NTF into a single report. These&#13;
reports would be submitted by not later than two (2) months after the end of each quarter of the calendar&#13;
year following Loan Effectiveness. The formats would be mutually agreed upon prior to the date of the&#13;
first submission and would be modified as deemed appropriate during the implementation of the project.&#13;
Mid-Term Report&#13;
4.9    A mid-term report would be prepared and submitted to the WB by the NTF. The report would&#13;
be submitted about March 2000 which would review, inter alia, the objectives and status of project&#13;
implementation as compared with the original plan.&#13;
Implementation Completion Report (ICR)&#13;
4.10   An ICR would be submitted to the WB by the NTF upon completion of the project and in any&#13;
event not later than six (6) months after the final disbursement of the Loan proceeds. Each participating&#13;
agency would prepare its own report for consolidation by the NTF into a single ICR. Included in the&#13;
ICR would be: an assessment on the execution and initial operation of the project; its costs and benefits&#13;
derived or to be derived; the performance of the Borrower and the WB and other agencies involved,&#13;
regarding their respective obligations and accomplishments; and lessons learned. Included also would&#13;
be the plans for future operation of the programs which have been financed under the project and&#13;
indicators for the monitoring and evaluation of future operations.&#13;
D. World Bank Supervision&#13;
4.11   This is the first WB financed education project in the Russian Federation with the expectation that&#13;
it would have long term effects in improved efficiency and effectiveness in the operation of the Higher&#13;
Education system and in the upgrading and improved supply of textbooks for compulsory education.&#13;
Consequently, it is important that concentrated attention be given to supervision of the project in the early&#13;
stages of implementation. The first supervision is scheduled for June 1997, and would include a small&#13;
"Launch" workshop for those involved directly with project implementation. A larger "Launch"&#13;
workshop will be held in September/October 1997 to include the Educational community. Supervision&#13;
in the first two (2) following years would consist of missions approximately every four months, followed&#13;
by a mid-term review mission, and every six months thereafter, followed by a ICR mission. Annex F&#13;
contains the Supervision Plan which provides full details on the planned supervision requirements.&#13;
4.12   The Human Resource Staff of the WB Moscow Resident Mission would provide day-to-day&#13;
support on educational issues, inter alia, and other Resident staff would provide support dealing with&#13;
procurement and disbursements requests and other relevant matters during the project implementation&#13;
period.&#13;

Basis of Cost Estimates&#13;
5.2    Cost estimates for Civil Works, Goods (computers and related hardware and software;&#13;
teaching/learning materials including textbooks, inter alia) and for Services consisting of local and foreign&#13;
Consultants, Seminars, Workshops, Study Tours and Fellowship Training have been derived from recent&#13;
experience from ongoing WB financed projects and from similar projects financed by other development&#13;
agencies in the Russian Federation. Costs for consultants have been estimated on the basis of cost of fees&#13;
and, as applicable, accommodation and subsistence in the Russian Federation and including transportation&#13;
and translation and interpretation services.&#13;
Foreign Exchange Component&#13;
5.3   The foreign exchange component of US$33.1 million represents 38% of the project cost, net of&#13;
duties and taxes. The foreign exchange component was estimated as follows: (a) Civil Works, 10%; (b)&#13;
Goods, 40%; (c) Services: (i) foreign consultants, 100% and local consultants 10%; (ii) Seminars,&#13;
Workshops, 10%; (iii) Overseas Study Tours and Fellowships, 100%; and (d) Administrative Expenses,&#13;
20%.&#13;
Contingency Allowances&#13;
5.4    Contingencies are not included in the project cost as all components would be subject to an agreed&#13;
maximum allocation. The status of the allocations would be included as a part of the quarterly reports&#13;
and adjustments made between the allocations, as may be deemed appropriate, after review by the WB.&#13;
Duties and Taxes&#13;
5.5   The project would be subject to duties and taxes, estimated at US$9.6 million equivalent. For&#13;
imported goods, an average of 20% of the estimated cost has been used to calculate custom duties. VAT,&#13;
for both imported and locally procured goods, has been calculated at 20%. It is however anticipated that&#13;
the HEIs would receive some tax relief for instructional related goods. Project costs include an average&#13;
of 25% (maximum of 30%) for personal income tax for local consulting services (individuals). Tax on&#13;
consultants originating outside of Russia with contracts exceeding 183 days in a 12 month period, is&#13;
estimated at about 40% of total contract amount (20% VAT on contract amount plus 20% local income&#13;
tax). Income taxes on foreign consultants on short term assignments (less than 183 days per annum),&#13;
would not normally be applicable and has not been included. The Government has advised that each&#13;
participating entity would be responsible for the payment of all applicable duties and taxes and such&#13;
requirement would be clearly set forth in the sub-project and sub-loan agreements.&#13;
B. Project Financing&#13;
Financing Plan&#13;
5.6   The proposed Loan of US$71.0 million would finance 100% of the foreign exchange component&#13;
(US$33.1 million) and about 70% (US$37.9 million) of local costs, net of duties and taxes. The&#13;
Government, through participating entities, would provide US$16.0 million equivalent, representing&#13;
agreed local cost sharing and about US$9.6 million equivalent of duties and taxes. The financial plan&#13;
is shown in Table 5.2 below.&#13;
&#13;

Total PROJECT COSTS (inclusive of duties &amp; taxes):                      96.60&#13;
Administrative Cost (Incremental Operating Costs)&#13;
5.7    The Administrative cost of NTF (i.e., incremental operating costs) would include staff salaries&#13;
and allowances and social charges for local staff; costs of consultants (including a procurement advisor,&#13;
if required) as deemed essential for the administration of the project. Included would be the costs of&#13;
annual project audits; bank charges and fees; training; office rent; renovation/maintenance of office&#13;
facilities, utilities; communication charges (including international telephone calls and facsimile&#13;
transmissions); miscellaneous office equipment and consumable supplies; maintenance of office&#13;
equipment; and local and international transport related to the project and other administrative costs as&#13;
may be agreed. Administrative costs of the NTF would be based on an annual budget reviewed by the&#13;
WB. All works, goods and services would be procured in accordance with the procedures for works,&#13;
goods and services described below and as set forth in the Loan Agreement. The NTF would include,&#13;
as a separate part of the quarterly reports, an update of its expenditures for review by the WB.&#13;
Recurrent Cost Implications and Sustainability&#13;
5.8    The project will provide incentives for improved efficiency in selected HEIs and will create the&#13;
basis for improving the quality and provision of textbooks to the compulsory education system. The cost&#13;
recovery system whereby competing HEIs would repay 20% of grants to the Ministry of Finance&#13;
introduces the incentive for these institutions to improve their internal efficiency, reduces the dependance&#13;
of project activities on the government budget, and contributes to the incremental operating costs of the&#13;
NTF (approximately $1.1 million per year for six years). However, there is no guarantee that project&#13;
related administration of the NTF would be financially sustainable beyond the life of the project.&#13;
Therefore, if at the Mid Term Review of the Project it is determined that project activities should&#13;
continue beyond the life of the Project, appropriate cost recovery measures would have to be instituted.&#13;
C. Procurement&#13;
5.9    The NTF would have administrative/oversight responsibility for all procurement activities for&#13;
works, goods and services financed from the proceeds of the Loan.&#13;

Summary of Procurement Procedures&#13;
5.10  Procurement of works, goods and services would be in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines,&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated January 1995 (revised January and August 1996)&#13;
and "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as&#13;
Executing Agency" dated August, 1981. Works and Goods would grouped to the extent practicable to&#13;
encourage competitive bidding. Procurement procedures would be as indicated in Table 5.3 below.&#13;
Annex H contains the Project Implementation Schedule, including a Procurement Plan.&#13;
Status of Procurement Preparation&#13;
5.11   No major procurement of works or goods is expected in the first 9-12 months of the project. It&#13;
is expected that selection of consultants including, in particular, the establishment of the various&#13;
committees would proceed for which standard selection documentation would be used.&#13;

Procurement of Civil Works&#13;
5.12   Civil works, consisting basically of minor renovation of existing educational facilities under the&#13;
Social Sciences Reform Component (Part A) and NTF office facilities, estimated at about US$2.3 million&#13;
equivalent, would be procures as follows:&#13;
5.13   Small Works: Civil works estimated to cost less that US$100,000 equivalent per contract (total&#13;
of about US$2.3 million equivalent) would be procured under lump sum, fixed price contracts awarded&#13;
on the basis of quotations obtained from three (3) qualified domestic contractors in response to a written&#13;
invitation.  The invitation would include a detailed description of the works, including basic&#13;
specifications, the required completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to the World Bank,&#13;
and relevant drawings, where applicable. The award would be made to the contractor who offers the&#13;
lowest price quotation for the required works, and who has the experience and resources to successfully&#13;
complete the contract. It is anticipated that this procedure would involve about 50 contracts over about&#13;
a four year period.&#13;
5.14   Civil Works estimated at US$1.2 million consisting of numerous small renovations required&#13;
basically for the upgrading of existing facilities under Part B of the project (School Textbook Reform)&#13;
for the installation of new computer systems and related equipment and for new teaching/learning&#13;
equipment would be procured following local procurement procedures. This work would be ineligible&#13;
for financing from the proceeds of the Loan and, subject to review by the WB, the non-tax portion may&#13;
be considered as a part of the Government's local cost sharing requirements.&#13;
Procurement of Goods&#13;
5.15   Goods (US$38.9 million---US$31.6 million excluding duties and taxes) would consist of, inter&#13;
alia, teaching/learning materials including computers and related equipment and software, office furniture&#13;
and miscellaneous consumable supplies, and textbooks. The following procurement procedures would&#13;
be utilized:&#13;
(a)   International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures would be utilized for contracts above&#13;
US$300,000 equivalent for a total of about US$20.0 million (51% of total goods). This would&#13;
involve about 22 bid packages over a three year period (2-3 for computers and about 10 for&#13;
teaching/learning material and about three (3) for textbooks).&#13;
(b)    Limited International Bidding (LIB), US$3.0 million (8% of total goods), procedures would be&#13;
used to purchase teaching/learning materials and equipment. LIB would be used for specialized&#13;
purchases where few potential suppliers are available (i.e., suppliers of specific goods would&#13;
participate by invitation rather than in response to an advertisement). About four (4) bidding&#13;
packages are anticipated.&#13;
(c)    National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures would be permitted for goods (teaching/learning&#13;
materials, office furniture and equipment, inter alia, that are locally available and would be&#13;
unlikely to attract foreign competition) that cannot be grouped in packages above US$300,000&#13;
equivalent (i. e., for packages less than $300,000) for a total of US$3.2 million (8% of total&#13;
goods). This would involve in excess of 15 bid packages over a four year period. Advertisement&#13;

Russian Federation: Education Innovation Project                                Page 27&#13;
will be in local newspapers. Interested foreign suppliers would be eligible to participate.&#13;
Standardized bidding documents, developed by the ECA Region, would be used.&#13;
(d)   International and National Shopping (IS and NS) procurement procedures estimated at about&#13;
US$1.2 million would be used for readily available off-the-self goods of standard specifications&#13;
that are small in value. IS procedures would be used for goods valued at less that US$250,000&#13;
up to an aggregate of about US$1.0 millon and NS procedures would be used for goods valued&#13;
at less that US$50,000 up to an aggregate of about US$0.2 million (IS and NS approximately 3 %&#13;
of total goods). It is expected that miscellaneous office equipment and supplies, non-proprietary&#13;
spare parts and certain teaching/learning materials/equipment for the HEIs would be procured&#13;
using IS and NS procedures. IS procedures would require quotations from a least three (3)&#13;
suppliers from two different countries and for NS procedures, quotations from at least three (3)&#13;
local suppliers would be required. For IS, about 10 bid packages and for NS, about eight (8) bid&#13;
packages are anticipated.&#13;
(e)    Direct Contracting (DC) (US$6.0 million-about 15% of total goods) where the required goods&#13;
are proprietary and obtainable from only one source may be used for certain textbooks and other&#13;
teaching/learning materials, subject to prior review by the WB. About 12 bid packages are&#13;
anticipated.&#13;
Preference for Domestically Manufactured Goods&#13;
5.16   For contracts for goods to be awarded on the basis of ICB, the Borrower may, as set forth in the&#13;
Loan Agreement, grant a margin of preference in the evaluation of bids of up to 15% or the amount of&#13;
applicable custom duties, whichever is lower, to qualified domestic manufacturers of goods.&#13;
Procurement/Selection Procedurefor Consulting Services&#13;
5.17  Included in the Project would be consulting services for about 150 staff-years of experts. These&#13;
services would consist of specialists for the Expert Committees; the Federal Expert Council; and the&#13;
Expert Commissions and include, inter alia, study groups for curricula and textbook development. Also&#13;
included would be staff of the NTF as required for the administration/implementation of the project.&#13;
Because of the short term and diverse nature of many assignments required by the project, it is anticipated&#13;
that a majority of the consulting contracts would be awarded to individual consultants through competitive&#13;
selection. Where practical, efforts would be made to group assignments into larger packages to be&#13;
awarded through short listing of firms.&#13;
5.18   Consultants would be hired on terms and conditions (including review of their qualifications), in&#13;
accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to the WB on the basis of the "Guidelines for the&#13;
Use of Consultants by the World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" dated&#13;
August, 1981 and Standard Forms of Contract, where applicable, would be utilized. Standardized forms&#13;
of contracts, which set forth agreed conditions would be included in the Operation Manual (para. 4.6)&#13;
and would be utilized for specialized local services with payment based on an agreed standard pay scale.&#13;
The majority of the local short term experts would come from the local education community and re-&#13;
numeration would be in the form of an honorarium (based on the agreed standard pay scale).&#13;

Selection Procedure for Grants for Textbook Publishers&#13;
5.19   A competitive selection procedure would be used for manuscript development by authors and for&#13;
pre-press and promotional information by publishers. The agreed selection procedure is to be set forth&#13;
in the Operational Manual (para. 3.18 and Annex B).&#13;
Seminars/Workshops&#13;
5.20   The NTF would develop an initial plan for the carrying out of seminars and workshops which&#13;
would be submitted for prior review by the WB. This plan would include, inter alia, the content,&#13;
audience, schedule, and estimated costs. The status of the plan would be included as a part of the&#13;
quarterly reports and would be updated and/or modified as may be mutually agreed between the NTF and&#13;
the WB.&#13;
Overseas Study Tours and Fellowship Training&#13;
5.21   The NTF would develop an initial plan which would include for Overseas Study Tours the&#13;
purpose, names/titles of participants, along with itinerary and estimated costs; and for Fellowship&#13;
Training, the qualifications of candidates along with their course and length of study; proposed training&#13;
institution; and costs. This plan would be submitted for prior review by the WB. The status of this plan&#13;
would be included as a part of the quarterly reports and updated and/or modified as may be mutually&#13;
agreed between the NTF and the WB. Overseas Study Tours and Fellowship Training would normally&#13;
be limited to short term tours and training programs (about four weeks for tours and about three months&#13;
for training).&#13;
Notification of Business Opportunities&#13;
5.22   A General Procurement Notice will be published in the May 18, 1997 edition of the UN&#13;
publication "Development Business" and, as appropriate, would be updated and published annually&#13;
thereafter. For Goods to be obtained by ICB, individual bidding opportunities would also be advertised&#13;
in a major local newspaper thirty (30) days prior to availability of bidding documents and transmitted to&#13;
potential bidders who expressed interest in bidding in response to the published General Procurement&#13;
Notice. The local advertisement procedure would be repeated for all bidding packages utilizing ICB (at&#13;
least 30 days in advance of availability of bidding documents). The local advertisements would be in the&#13;
English language and at the option of the Borrower, also in Russian.&#13;
Review By World Bank of Procurement Decisions&#13;
5.23   Procurement Planning: Prior to the issuance of any invitations for bidding (for each part of the&#13;
project including Project Administration), the proposed procurement plans shall be furnished to the WB&#13;
for review, in accordance with the provisions of para. 1 of Appendix 1 of the Procurement Guidelines.&#13;
Procurement of all goods shall be undertaken in accordance with the procurement plans with corrective&#13;
actions taken where necessary as indicated in para. 1 of the mentioned Appendix. The Implementation&#13;
Plans would be included as a part of the quarterly reports and updated periodically as appropriate.&#13;

5.24   Prior Review:&#13;
(a)    Works and Goods: Prior review of bidding documents for works and goods (including textbooks)&#13;
and review of evaluation and recommendations for award of contracts, would be carried out for&#13;
all procurement utilizing ICB, LIB and DC procedures. Contracts to be awarded using NCB,&#13;
IS, NS, and Small Works procurement procedures would require prior review of the list of the&#13;
proposed works and goods, including estimated costs. Standardized NCB, IS, NS and Small&#13;
Works bidding documents and proposed contract awards, in a sufficient number (minimum of 5&#13;
each) to ensure compliance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines, would be subject to prior&#13;
review by the WB. Accordingly, about 60% (by cost) of procurement transactions would be&#13;
subject to prior review by the WB;&#13;
(b)    Consultant Services: The selection/contracting procedures for consulting services would be&#13;
subject to prior review as set forth in the Guidelines for those contracts greater than US$50,000&#13;
for individuals and US$100,000 for firms, except that: (a) terms of reference; (b) qualifications&#13;
of individuals/firms; (c) single source selection of consulting firms; and (d) assignments of critical&#13;
nature, as reasonably determined by the WB, would be subject to prior review by the WB.&#13;
Accordingly, about 42% (by cost) of procurement transactions would be subject to prior review&#13;
by the WB;&#13;
(c)    Seminars, Workshops, Fellowships and Study Tours: As described in paras. 5.20 and 5.21 above.&#13;
(d)    Authors/Publishers: The selection procedure for the award of Grants for authors/publishers&#13;
would be reviewed following the agreed procedures as contained in the Operational Manual and&#13;
as outlined in Annex B.&#13;
(e)    Textbooks: List(s) of textbooks would be submitted to the WB for prior review including the&#13;
estimate of costs and proposed method(s) of procurement.&#13;
5.25   Post Review:&#13;
(a)    The documentation for all procurement transactions, not covered by prior review, would be&#13;
subject to post review in accordance with paragraph 4 of Appendix 1 of the Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement and would be subject to review during the WB's periodic supervision missions; and&#13;
(b)    After award of contract, should any material modifications or waiver of the terms and conditions&#13;
of a contract for works and goods (including textbooks) and/or services result in an increase&#13;
above 15% of the original contract price, the WB would reserve the right to the prior review of&#13;
such modifications. In addition, prior review by the WB would be required for: (i) amendments&#13;
to contracts for the employment of consulting firms raising the contract value to US$100,000&#13;
equivalent or above, or (ii) amendments to contracts for the employment of individual consultants&#13;
raising the contract value to US$50,000 equivalent or above.&#13;

Agreement.&#13;
D. Disbursement&#13;
Schedule&#13;
5.27    The proposed Loan is expected to be disbursed in six (6) years which includes six months for the&#13;
finalization of accounts and submission of withdrawal applications and other reports. Annex I contains&#13;
the disbursement forecast which is based on a work program prepared by the Education Working Group&#13;
and staff of the WB which is considered to be realistic. Loan Effectiveness (90 days after loan signing)&#13;
would be in September 1997. However, based on previous experience in the Russian Federation, a date&#13;
of December 1997 has been used for planning purposes. The project is scheduled to be completed by&#13;
June 30, 2003 (Project Completion Date) with a Loan Closing Date of December 31, 2003.&#13;
Disbursement Percentages&#13;
5.28    The proceeds of the Loan would be disbursed as shown in Table 5.4 below.&#13;

Statement of Expenditures&#13;
5.29   Disbursements would be made against Statements of Expenditures for: (a) works and goods&#13;
costing less than US$100,000 equivalent each contract; (b) services for contracts for (i) individuals&#13;
costing less than US$50,000 equivalent each; and (ii) firms costing less than US$100,000 equivalent each;&#13;
(c) seminars, workshops, fellowships and study tours costing less than US$25,000 each; and (d)&#13;
incremental operating costs. Detailed documents evidencing these expenditures would be reviewed and&#13;
retained by the NTF and made available for the required audit as well as to WB supervision missions.&#13;
Disbursements against contracts for works, goods and services exceeding the above limits would be made&#13;
against normal documentation.&#13;
Special Account&#13;
5.30   To facilitate timely project implementation, the Borrower may establish, maintain and operate,&#13;
under condition acceptable to the WB, a Special Account in US dollars in a commercial bank. The&#13;
selection process and criteria for selection of the commercial bank would follow the WB standard&#13;
selection procedures. During the early stage of implementation of the project, the initial allocation of the&#13;
Special Account would be limited to US$0.2 million. However, when the aggregate disbursement under&#13;
the Loan have reached the level of US$2.0 million, the initial allocation may be increased up to the&#13;
authorized allocation of US$3.0 million by submitting the relevant Application for Withdrawal.&#13;
Replenishment applications should be submitted at least every three months, and must include reconciled&#13;
bank statements as well as other appropriate supporting documents.&#13;
5.31   The minimum application size for payments directly from the Loan Account or for issuance of&#13;
Special Commitments is 20% of the current Special Account authorized allocations.&#13;
5.32   A separate Project Account for the NTF would not be required under this project since the&#13;
participating entities would be responsible for the local cost sharing requirements and for any applicable&#13;
duties and taxes. It was determined that a separate NTF Project Account, under prevailing Russian Law,&#13;
would likely result in the loss of any duty and tax free exemptions by, in particular, the HEIs. For non-&#13;
WB financed items, which would qualify under the cost sharing arrangement, each participating agency&#13;
would maintain separate accounts/records, following agreed acceptable accounting methods for those local&#13;
funds, which would be submitted to the NTF for inclusion into the annual audits.&#13;
E. Financial Management&#13;
Accounts and Auditing&#13;
5.33   The NTF would be responsible for the appropriate accounting of the funds provided under the&#13;
Loan and by the Borrower (Project) in accordance with internationally accepted accounting procedures,&#13;
and for reporting on the use of these funds, and ensuring that audits of the financial statements or reports&#13;
are submitted to WB in a timely manner. A computerized accounting system has been established in the&#13;
NTF for these activities. The NTF would maintain consolidated accounts for the project and would&#13;
prepare monthly financial reports.&#13;
5.34   All project records and accounts, including in particular those for the Special Account and for&#13;
Statements of Expenditures, would be audited annually in accordance with the WB Guidelines for&#13;
Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects financed by the World Bank dated March 1982. Auditing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

would be performed by independent auditors, acceptable to the WB. Audit reports would be submitted&#13;
to the WB within six months after the end of each Government fiscal year in such scope and detail as the&#13;
WB may reasonably request. Funds have been included in the Project for the services of auditors.&#13;

VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
Benefits&#13;
6.1    The proposed project is designed to improve the quality, quantity, governance and efficiency&#13;
of Russian education.&#13;
6.2    With respect to Higher Education the project will:&#13;
*     Enhance quality through incentives designed to make it comparable with international education&#13;
in social sciences;&#13;
*     Increase quantity by increasing the number of appropriately trained social scientists through&#13;
project investment in facilities, equipment, libraries and software;&#13;
*     Improve governance through the development and use of instruments that facilitate transparent&#13;
and accountable management of Higher Education; and&#13;
*     Encourage efficiency through better use of available resources and through an incentive scheme&#13;
for the preparation of graduates.&#13;
6.3    The School Textbook Reform component will:&#13;
*     Enhance quality through the further development of nationally established educational standards&#13;
and tests, the encouragement of more relevant and better quality textbooks;&#13;
*     Increase quantity and efficiency through better information systems which will permit choice and&#13;
timely ordering of school textbooks.&#13;
*     Increase significantly the role of the private sector in the supply of new educational titles.&#13;
6.4   The Pilot Textbook Procurement Fund will contribute towards:&#13;
*      overcoming barriers to entry and encouraging more competitive selection of textbooks&#13;
*     the demonopolization of the textbook publishing industry;&#13;
*      the creation of a sustainable system of funding for textbook supply for secondary education&#13;
6.5    There will be savings in educational costs as a result of:&#13;
*     more efficient use of resources in HEIs;&#13;
*     incentives for more transparent management and accounting practices within HEIs;&#13;
*     introduction of competition into textbook production.&#13;
6.6   There will be some direct cost-recovery from the HEIs but it will be less than complete. It is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 34                                                                          Chapter VI&#13;
anticipated that some of the HEI cost-savings will permit some overdue maintenance of HEIs. Any cost-&#13;
savings in the supply of textbooks could have a direct impact on local budgets.&#13;
6.7    Although the IF will provide only a modest amount of support towards reform, experience&#13;
elsewhere has shown that the effects of similar mechanisms provide a positive model for change which&#13;
may be taken up by non-participating institutions which recognize the benefit of such an approach. This&#13;
demonstration effect is an important feature of the sustainability of innovative approaches such as the IF.&#13;
This component would also provide better and more accurate information on individual educational&#13;
institutions which would benefit the next operations in the sector.&#13;
6.8   Increased efficiency is expected to lead to savings in expenditure on higher education, increased&#13;
numbers of graduates in social sciences and improved quality of graduates. However, it is not feasible&#13;
to calculate economic rates of return to these expenditures. In part this is because in such a pilot project&#13;
it is extremely difficult to predict the precise outcomes. Second, the scarcity of graduates with training&#13;
in modem economics and finance has been so acute in Russia in recent years that their current salary&#13;
levels would probably exaggerate the apparent economic returns from the project. Third, while there is&#13;
no doubt that the availability of textbooks is a critical element in the educational effectiveness of schools,&#13;
there is no information that can be used to estimate the economic impact of this improved effectiveness.&#13;
6.9    Without this project, Higher Education in Russia would continue to suffer from a shortage of&#13;
graduates in economics and other social sciences disciplines and would have to rely on more costly&#13;
solutions to the need for well trained graduates in these disciplines. Similarly, without the initiatives&#13;
which will be piloted in the School Textbook Reform component and without the Pilot Textbook&#13;
Procurement Fund, the spread of new learning materials and the reform of the textbook publishing&#13;
industry would be delayed.&#13;
Risks&#13;
6.10  It is difficult to be certain of the eventual demand for the Innovation Fund. Since participating&#13;
HEIs will have to make some repayments, there may be reluctance on the part of some of the most&#13;
deserving HEIs to apply for grants. This might result in under use of the funds, or their use only by&#13;
institutions which rely heavily on fee-paying students. Since, even with some cost-recovery, there will&#13;
be some implicit subsidies, this could mean that the project was being inequitable. The participatory&#13;
nature of project preparation, with sustained involvement of individuals representing a geographically and&#13;
structurally diverse set of institutions, suggests that this risk is small. However, a further related risk&#13;
that high rates of repayment would provide incentives for participating HEIs to engage in dubious&#13;
commercial activities in order to repay the grants will also be taken into consideration. There will be&#13;
careful monitoring of these potential risks, and the project design offers considerable flexibility to alter&#13;
the incentives for application and/or condition of awards if the initial outcomes suggest that this would&#13;
be desirable. It is also possible that HEIs will not continue with courses once the grants to initiate them&#13;
have been fully used. Since the project will finance start-up rather than recurrent costs, this risk seems&#13;
to be small.   The cost recovery system whereby competing Higher Education Institutions would&#13;
guarantee to repay 20% of grants to the Ministry of Finance introduces a powerful incentive for these&#13;
self selected institutions to achieve their own internal efficiency and improves the sustainability of the&#13;
reform elements of the project.&#13;
6.11   The Pilot Textbook Procurement Fund poses the risk that there might be limited demand from&#13;
oblasts for loans to procure textbooks, given the stringent fiscal situation in Russia. Another risk,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Education Innovation Project                                      Page 35&#13;
associated with the textbook related components of the project, is that the barriers to entry for new private&#13;
publishers will remain too high, and the project will not succeed in promoting competition for school&#13;
textbooks. Current high real interest rates are a potentially severe deterrent to private publishers, and&#13;
some observers have argued that without interest subsidies, demonopolization of the textbook publishing&#13;
industry will be limited. Others feel that this is too pessimistic, and that the development of clear and&#13;
open mechanisms for establishing educational standards and evaluating and approving textbooks, grants&#13;
to develop new titles and more efficient methods for disseminating information about textbook availability&#13;
and ordering will be adequate. These components will be carefully monitored and evaluated. The pilot&#13;
nature of the Textbook Fund component and the overall cautious scope of the project will provide&#13;
important lessons for future Bank projects in the education sector in Russia.&#13;

ANNEX A&#13;
HIGHER EDUCATION INNOVATION FUND&#13;
PROJECT BACKGROUND&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    In 1993 staff of the World Bank (WB) together with colleagues from a wide range of institutions&#13;
within the Government of Russia (GOR), including the State Committee for Higher Education (SCHE),&#13;
universities and other educational institutions, began work on a review of the education sector. The results&#13;
of that initiative was the report entitled Russia: Education in the Transition'. Subsequently, in December,&#13;
1994, the main conclusions of the report were discussed at a seminar attended by high level officials from&#13;
the GOR together with the authors of the report and representatives of the WB. Following discussions&#13;
between the GOR and the management of the World Bank it was agreed that initial steps should be taken&#13;
towards identifying a project for WB financing. Accordingly, from May 1995, the WB and the GOR have&#13;
worked intensively on project identification and design.  At a pre-appraisal mission held at Golitsyno&#13;
in September, 1996 an early version of this document was discussed with representatives of the Ministry&#13;
of Education, the Rectors and the working party. It was subsequently revised and agreed during the&#13;
appraisal mission in December, 1996.&#13;
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN HIGHER EDUCATION&#13;
2.    The higher education system of the Russian Federation is currently under strong outside pressure.&#13;
The most important factors of outside influence are as follows:&#13;
a.    changes in the general economic situation and reduction of federal budget financing;&#13;
b.    changes in the needs of the general public for education;&#13;
c.    changes in the needs of employers for human resources produced by the higher education&#13;
system;&#13;
d.    expansion of Russia's international contacts and the need to bring education standards in&#13;
Russia in line with the best international patterns.&#13;
3.    Over the last 3-4 years the higher education system has seen substantial improvements which&#13;
indicate gradual adaptation to the above factors. New laws on education with amendments have been&#13;
adopted 2, Important indications of efforts to adjust to changing needs of the general public for education&#13;
and needs of employers for human resources are changes in distribution of admissions and graduations&#13;
by areas of specialization, increase in the number of new private schools which provide training in the&#13;
I     World Bank, Russia: Education in the Transition, December 1995.&#13;
2     Law of the Russian Federation on Education (Vedomosti Syezda Narodnykh Deputatov Rossiiskoi&#13;
Federatsii I Verkhovnogo Soveta Rossiiskoi Federatsii) July, 1992, No.30, Article 1797 and Amendments &amp;&#13;
addenda to the Law 'On Education' No. 12-FZ, January, 1996; Federal Law on Higher and Postgraduate&#13;
Professional Education, 22 August 1996.&#13;

most wanted areas, changes in standards and the content of education.3 Some changes occurred in the&#13;
system of governance and management of higher education institutions (HEIs), reflected in the&#13;
consolidation of the central structure of higher education management, the increase of academic freedom,&#13;
and the introduction of the system of election of rectors. 4 The system responded to reduced federal&#13;
budget funding by drawing increasingly on the extra-budgetary and local budgets sources 5.&#13;
4.    Yet the pace and nature of the response to the external pressure remain clearly inadequate. The&#13;
regulatory legal framework is incomplete; different HEIs are governed by different government agencies;&#13;
there is little reliable information on how the system operates so it is hard to take decisions; multiple-&#13;
source financing is slow to develop; management systems are flawed; regional and professional&#13;
(disciplinary) co-ordination is weak. However, it would be misleading to present higher education as&#13;
unreformed or unreformable. Within the higher education community, many institutions are oriented to&#13;
reform, or at least to modernization, and experience frustration at their incapacity to achieve their reform&#13;
objectives. A key element is the need to overcome the consequences of intellectual isolation from the&#13;
international professional academic community.&#13;
LESSONS FROM WORLD BANK EXPERIENCE&#13;
5.    The World Bank has considerable experience in the use of innovation type funds within higher&#13;
education projects, for example in Hungary, Indonesia, Tunisia, Brazil, Argentina and the Bank's first&#13;
operation in higher education in Romania.&#13;
6.     The lessons which are particularly relevant to the present project are that in the field of higher&#13;
education reform and management of higher education, incentives are to be preferred to compulsion.&#13;
Core budget funding, to be distributed to higher education institutions under an objective and transparent&#13;
system, encourages responsiveness to changing market demand and provides an ongoing incentive for&#13;
efficiency improvement. With commitment of the government to continue the process, the system can&#13;
be sustained long after the initial investment of the World Bank.&#13;
PROJECT CHARACTER AND REQUIREMENTS&#13;
7.    The relative smallness of the envisaged WB Educational Loan compared to the scale of&#13;
existing higher education expenditure imposes modest targets on what it seeks to achieve in terms of&#13;
reform. Taking into account the situation in Russian higher education and previous Bank experience with&#13;
educational projects, the WB team, together with Russian colleagues and following WB management&#13;
advice, agreed on the development of a project which would have the following characteristics:&#13;
a.    the project is of a pilot type;&#13;
b.    the project has two major objectives:&#13;
3      The report by Davies, Poletayev and Tate, Higher Education in Russia with Special Reference to&#13;
Economics and the Social Sciences summarizes the main features of institutional development in higher&#13;
education.&#13;
4      The nature of these influences are described in detail in the report by Green, Legal. Governance and&#13;
Management Aspects of Higher Education in Russia.&#13;
5     The report by Papps &amp; Tipenko, Costs &amp; Financing of Higher Education in the Russian Federation&#13;
summarizes the main features of the funding and financial aspects of higher education.&#13;

i.    to improve the quality of education;&#13;
ii.   to introduce a modest element of refonn;&#13;
c.    the project has the following features:&#13;
i.    an investment focus but with a reform agenda within it;&#13;
ii.    a simple implementation structure;&#13;
iii.    a design which does not depend for its success upon the introduction of an&#13;
overall 'grand' reform strategy;&#13;
iv.    a design which could withstand changes of government.&#13;
v.    sustainability of the outcomes.&#13;
FOCUS and ORGANIZATION of the PREPARATORY WORK&#13;
8.    For the purposes of project preparation more focused information was required than that available&#13;
in the report Russia: Education in the Transition. Therefore, following the completion of the initial steps&#13;
of project identification in September 1995, further studies were commissioned from Russian and&#13;
international experts who worked on the following topics:&#13;
a.    Higher Education in Russia with Special Reference to Economics and the Social Sciences6&#13;
b.    Legal, Governance and Management Aspects of Higher Education in Russia&#13;
c.    Costs and Financing of Higher Education in the Russian Federation&#13;
9.    During the field work on which these studies are based the international experts interviewed over&#13;
130 senior academics and administrators in more than 40 HEIs and 5 Government departments involved&#13;
in the education sector. Other studies which were also commissioned were:&#13;
a.    International Assistance to the Social Sciences Education&#13;
b.     Case studies of six Higher Education Institutions (HEls), namely:&#13;
i.    St. Petersburg University of Economics and Finance&#13;
ii.    Nizhny Novgorod State Linguistic University&#13;
iii.    Rostov State University.&#13;
iv.    Novosibirsk State University&#13;
v.    Institute for the Development of Entrepreneurship (Moscow)&#13;
vi.    Samara State Technical University.&#13;
10.   Where possible a team comprised of an international expert, a Russian expert and a local mentor&#13;
drawn from a senior position in Government to provide advice on the direction of the work.&#13;
THE INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE of PROJECT PREPARATION&#13;
11.   As is normal in relationships between the World Bank and individual countries several&#13;
interlocutors have different roles in shaping a project. In the case of the Education Innovation Project the&#13;
6      For the purposes of establishing the frame of reference for Window 1, "Social Sciences" has been&#13;
defined as the disciplines of: economics, sociology, and political sciences.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Education Innovation Project                                   Page 41&#13;
principal interlocutor with respect to the nature and scale of financing is the Ministry of Finance. On&#13;
technical matters two ministries have been closely concerned namely, the Ministry of Economy and the&#13;
Ministry of General and Professional Education (MGPE). The MGPE has been particularly involved in&#13;
the technical aspects of the project.&#13;
PROJECT OBJECTIVES WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF REFORMS&#13;
THE MAIN ISSUES&#13;
12.   Since 1990 the Russian higher education system has been rapidly changing. A lot of progress in&#13;
reforming the system has been achieved both at the governmental and the grass-root levels. Many&#13;
innovations and initiatives have been undertaken to meet the challenges of the transition from centrally-&#13;
planned economy and authoritarian society to the market economy system and democratic political system.&#13;
At the same time the reports show that at the moment the higher education is characterized by many&#13;
imbalances, distortions and imperfections, which are partly inherited from the old system, partly reflect&#13;
transitional processes. The main issues identified are:&#13;
a.    Structural-functional imbalances &amp; distortions. Underdevelopment of social sciences still&#13;
persist which influences the whole educational system. In many HEIs education is&#13;
oriented towards excessive specialization. Focus on inputs (number of staff, formal&#13;
qualifications of staff, length of courses and the hours a student spends on each course&#13;
etc.) rather than outputs is still dominating. Standards are frequently equated with initial&#13;
amount rather than final quality and the search for more efficient and effective methods&#13;
of teaching is inhibited. Responses of HEls to the market demand for educational services&#13;
and particular types of human capital bears short-term character. In the absence of the&#13;
long-term strategy on the governmental level this leads to the new structural-functional&#13;
distortions, reflected in the professional structure of enrolment, contents of education and&#13;
curriculum.&#13;
b.    Imbalances in centralization/autonomy proportions. HEIs have little real autonomy over&#13;
the use of budgetary funding, but at the same time there is no real accountability for&#13;
funding from other sources. They are constrained by norms and standards relating to&#13;
aspects such as staff-students ratios, teaching loads, etc. At the same time HEIs obtained&#13;
an extremely high degree of academic autonomy with insufficient guidance of the&#13;
contents of education, curriculum, etc., either on the side of the Government, or of the&#13;
academic community.&#13;
c.    Imbalanced relationship between administrative and academic responsibilities and&#13;
decision-making power within HEIs, accompanied by ineffective management system.&#13;
Academics have little decision-making power over the allocation of resources. In reality&#13;
this is under complete and unchallenged control of senior management. Administrative&#13;
decisions very rarely become subject of revision or approval by autonomous stake-holders&#13;
of HEIs. Quite often trivial decisions are taken at very high levels. This results in&#13;
slowness of decision-making and, perhaps more serious, a split between the decision and&#13;
its impact. Formal decision-making responsibility is in the hands of a relatively few&#13;
number of people. Most of the staff in Russian HEIs seem to have little real power to&#13;
make decisions and, as a consequence, bear little responsibility.&#13;

d.    Imbalances of public/private elements in the system  of HE. Introduction of&#13;
commercialized elements in HE (connected with short-term orientation on current demand&#13;
for educational services and new human capital) undermines public roots of HE, leads&#13;
to unnecessary neglect of fundamental education and general knowledge. Also this&#13;
preserves low level of public accountability and transparency, opposes participation of&#13;
non-university members in HEIs governance. HEIs are drifting toward being profit-&#13;
making centers instead of a non-profit providers of the educational services. This is&#13;
worsened by the absence of clearly specified property rights (laws, charters, rules), which&#13;
opens a possibility to "spontaneous privatization" of the public HEIs.&#13;
THE DIRECTION OF REFORM&#13;
13.   The reports imply, therefore, that the WB project should support institutional changes which&#13;
would lead to the reform of the system. These reforms are expected to, inter alia, contribute to:&#13;
a.    elimination of structural-functional imbalances, particularly by improvement of the quality&#13;
of education in social sciences with special emphasis on the educational outputs;&#13;
b.    correction of centralization/autonomy imbalances; support of the prospective initiatives&#13;
and innovations in HE at the grass-root level; development of academic co-ordination and&#13;
monitoring of the quality of education;&#13;
C.    development of the separation of administrative and academic responsibilities;&#13;
improvement of the system of management;&#13;
d.    increase of various stake-holders' involvement in the governance of HEIs; increase of&#13;
accountability and transparency of HEIs management.&#13;
PROJECT DESIGN&#13;
THE INNOVATION FUND&#13;
14.   Guided by the above mentioned objectives and constraints, and following intensive discussions&#13;
in Russia and within the WB (in which the lessons of the WB experience were carefully reviewed) it was&#13;
decided to prepare an investment project within a Fund structure. An Innovation Fund (IF) would be&#13;
established for the purpose of promoting an improvement in the quality of education and reform in higher&#13;
education in Russia. The IF would focus on the development of economics and social sciences in a way&#13;
which supports reform initiatives. Grants would be made based on the result of a competitive process&#13;
between higher education institutions. Conditions of application and selection criteria would be approved&#13;
by the WB and then publicized and awards would be determined in a transparent manner on an efficient&#13;
basis. The amount of the fund will be approximately US $50 million.&#13;
SCOPE of the FUND&#13;
15.   It was agreed at an early stage in project preparation with representatives of the GOR that the&#13;
focus of the IF would be on the improvement of the quality of education within economics and social&#13;
sciences and on the reform of the governance and management of HEIs. This decision was made by the&#13;
GOR because social sciences are seen as a priority sector to support economic restructuring and need a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Education Innovation Project                                 Page 43&#13;
great deal of development in qualitative terms7 and there was a wish to improve the governance and&#13;
management of HEIs to benefit all aspects of higher education.&#13;
WINDOWS WITHIN THE FUND&#13;
16.   There would be three windows of support within the Innovation Fund. Each of these windows&#13;
addresses certain aspects of reform in HE. Programs supported within these windows should not be&#13;
considered as separate. For example, the development of professional linkages with international partners&#13;
to ensure comparability of standards is an integral element of each window. They are complementary&#13;
to each other and mutually supportive.&#13;
Window 1:   Social Science Institutions Capacity Building. This Window would support Social&#13;
Science Development Schemes (SSDSs) by partially repayable grants allocated on a&#13;
competitive selection basis for improvements in the teaching of social sciences linked to&#13;
reform of governance and management at the institutional level. Up to 70% of the total&#13;
fund would be allocated to this window.&#13;
Window 2:   Governance Refonn. This Window would support Structural Reform Schemes (SRSs)&#13;
by partially repayable grants allocated on a competitive selection basis for governance&#13;
reform efforts. The proportion of the total fund allocated to this window would be up&#13;
to 22% of the total fund.&#13;
Window 3:   Social Sciences Academic Support. This window  would support Social Sciences&#13;
Academic Award Schemes (SSASSs), academic co-operation and co-ordination of&#13;
professional activity designed to support the development of structural reform and the&#13;
social sciences (seminars, visiting scholarships, the exchange of professorships, scientific&#13;
journals, professional associations, the development of networks and lateral connections&#13;
in the social sciences supported in the project). The amount allocated to this window is&#13;
not to exceed 8% of the total amount of the fund.&#13;
FEATURES OF SOCIAL SCIENCE DEVELOPMENT SCHEMES (SSDS) AND STRUCTURAL&#13;
REFORM SCHEMES (SRS)&#13;
17.   The project will invite applications for grants to finance SSDSs and SRSs. Priority in funding&#13;
would be given to schemes which contain the following features:&#13;
a.    institutional development: the extent to which the schemes contribute to or require&#13;
positive reform of management and/or administrative structures and procedures;&#13;
b.    devolved decision-making within the HEI could be a feature of each SSDS and SRS&#13;
submitted. This might show the extent to which the SSDSs and SRSs provide incentives&#13;
and opportunities for junior teaching staff to engage in effective decision-making;&#13;
c.    efficient funding formulae: illustrating how  the schemes allow  or promote the&#13;

Economics and the Social Sciences.&#13;

Page 44                                                                         Annex A&#13;
development of funding formulae (for example, staff salaries, library resources, course&#13;
delivery) which are based on measures of output;&#13;
d.    basis for future reform and for the future academic development within the institution&#13;
should be present in any scheme;&#13;
e.    flexibility which recognizes not only the numerical variable of supply and demand but&#13;
also the changing content of any discipline should be evident within the scheme;&#13;
f.    a review of teaching methods, including a review of staff/student ratios and the use of&#13;
appropriate technology, (and its influence on the HEI's physical resources) would form&#13;
an essential element in a successful scheme.&#13;
GOVERNANCE of the INNOVATION FUND&#13;
18.   The Innovation Fund will be administered by the National Training Foundation (NTF) which will&#13;
act as a Project Implementation Unit (PIU), empowered by the GOR to administer the Loan in accordance&#13;
with the objectives of the project (Annex D). The operation of the Innovation Fund will be governed by&#13;
the Board of Directors of the NTF which will represent the interests of the stakeholders: that is, the&#13;
Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economy and the academic community.&#13;
Expert committees from appropriate disciplines will be established for the purpose of assessing and&#13;
recommending awards to the Board of Directors of the NTF. The Board of Directors will inter alia&#13;
confirm proposals to amend the operating principles of the IF; and confirm that awards made are&#13;
consistent with the operating principles of the IF and Loan Agreement. Procedures for the operations&#13;
of the Fund will be agreed and incorporated into an Annex to the Operations Manual of the NTF. The&#13;
reorganized staffing plan of the NTF will make available such technical advice and assistance as may be&#13;
required to carry out these extended functions.&#13;
WINDOWS OF THE INNOVATION FUND&#13;
SOCIAL SCIENCE INSTITUTIONS CAPACITY BUILDING (WINDOW 1): (GRANTS up to&#13;
$3,000,000)&#13;
19.   The purpose of this window is to develop the capacity of HEIs to teach social sciences in an&#13;
efficient and effective way and to undertake governance and management reforms at the institutional level.&#13;
Awards for SSDSs are conditional upon satisfactory proposals to undertake such reforms. Those HEIs&#13;
applying for Window 1 grants must also submit at the same time proposals on this subject. Awards will&#13;
be made on the basis of the combined merit of the proposed SSDS and SRS.&#13;
QUALIFYING ENTITIES&#13;
20.   A frame of reference (Attachment 1) has been developed on the basis of qualifying criteria namely&#13;
those HEIs teaching social sciences. The frame of reference produces 121 State HEIs with a wide&#13;
geographical spread, a substantial difference in sizes and provides a range of types of HEIs including&#13;
Technical Institutions and Pedagogical Institutions. Additionally, the frame of reference also contains&#13;
those HEIs which are acknowledged centers of excellence in the field of social science. Should such&#13;
HEIs submit schemes for funding and are successful in the competition the IF will strengthen strategic&#13;
points of growth in the Russian higher education sector. Private HEIs will be introduced into the frame&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Education Innovation Project                                    Page 45&#13;
of reference using the same qualifying criteria.&#13;
APPLICATION PROCEDURES&#13;
21. Each HEI in the frame of reference will receive a copy of the Application Procedures Document&#13;
(APD) which will outline the application procedures to be followed, the terms and conditions of grant&#13;
awards, the criteria of awards, the timetable, information required in proposal submissions, payment&#13;
conditions, monitoring and evaluation arrangements. Applications received will be judged initially on their&#13;
compliance to the conditions of the competition, and secondly, using the criteria and conditions specified&#13;
below. All applications will be judged on a competitive basis by the criteria listed below.&#13;
22.   Detailed guidelines for applications procedures and other relevant information are contained in&#13;
the Operational Manual for the project.&#13;
AWARD CRITERIA FOR SSDSs&#13;
23.    The essential general criteria are listed below and are those which will be applied to the selection&#13;
of Social Science Development Schemes (SSDSs). The object of the criteria in this section is to ensure&#13;
that the social science development schemes are of intrinsic value. Social science development criteria&#13;
concern the worthwhileness of the proposed scheme against such measures as: innovativeness, efficiency,&#13;
transportability, value for money, additionality, market relevance. Criteria against which applications&#13;
will be judged are listed below.&#13;
a.    innovativeness: assessors will expect the SSDSs to demonstrate an ability to introduce and&#13;
develop new ideas and materials in curricula and degrees comparable with internationally&#13;
recognized social science education currently offered by leading universities around the&#13;
world;&#13;
b.     efficiency: schemes should show the extent to which the methodology produces the&#13;
largest impact of the lowest cost;&#13;
c.    transportability: to maximize the value of the SSDS it should illustrate how the lessons&#13;
learned in its execution will be transferred to other parts of the HEI and, if appropriate,&#13;
to other Russian HEIs;&#13;
d.     value for money: the ratio of applicants to the number of places available;&#13;
e.    additionality: the extent to which the SSDS is dependent on finance by the IF such that&#13;
it would not be undertaken without this funding;&#13;
f.    market relevance: the contribution of the output of the scheme to the satisfaction of&#13;
market needs;&#13;
g.     evaluation: successful SSDSs will make provision for pre-scheme and post-scheme testing&#13;
to facilitate objective evaluation designed to show the influence of Pilot Project inputs in&#13;
relation to variables selected by the HEI.&#13;

AWARD PROCEDURE&#13;
25.   There will be four Expert Committees, one for each of the three academic disciplines supported&#13;
under the project (economics, sociology and politology) and a fourth committee to cover institutional&#13;
reform. Each committee will include at least one international member. HEIs will be invited to submit&#13;
applications for awards from the Fund by a date published three months in advance of closure. Should&#13;
the total amount allocated to any window not be fully expended after the first competition further&#13;
opportunities for HEIs to apply will be given until the fund is exhausted. The result of each competition&#13;
will be published nationally. All schemes will be subjected to assessment against the criteria in this&#13;
document by the appropriate Expert Committee. The Expert Committee will recommend awards to the&#13;
Board of Directors and grant awards will be processed according to the agreed procedures in the&#13;
Operations Manual.&#13;
ELIGIBLE EXPENDITURES&#13;
26.    Expenditures which would attract funding from the IF for improvements in the quality of&#13;
teaching in economics and social sciences include:&#13;
a.     program development costs (it is anticipated that within this category new courses might&#13;
be mounted which involve new styles of teaching and new approaches to learning.&#13;
Experimental programs of learning and teaching could also be encouraged such as inter-&#13;
disciplinary studies);&#13;
b.     consultancy services (which might be available from a wide range of sources within&#13;
Russia and from within higher education, commerce and industry in other countries);&#13;
c.     development of new textbooks (allowing research by potential authors; the training of&#13;
new writers; innovative approaches to the future style and content of textbooks and&#13;

DRAFT FRAME OF REFERENCE FOR WINDOW 1&#13;
1.    According to the existing official disciplinary classification, higher education in Russia is&#13;
organized at two levels. In the first level (4-5 years) students can obtain "specialist diploma" or bachelors&#13;
degree in one of "directions"; in the second level (an additional 1-2 years) students can obtain "specialist&#13;
diploma" or masters degree in one of "specialities". Not all of these specialties exist in reality and&#13;
existing ones often have little resemblance to specializations with similar titles in Western universities.&#13;
2.     Classification used in Russia treats economics/management and social sciences/humanities as two&#13;
separate groups (see Tables 1 and 2). As for the higher education in social sciences and humanities, it&#13;
can be divided into four large disciplinary groups: philosophy and theology; philology and linguistics,&#13;
history and social sciences, and a group of a more applied social disciplines (social work, psychology,&#13;
law, regional studies) (see Table 2).&#13;
3.     Following formal disciplinary classification and taking into account the results of the qualitative&#13;
analysis of the contents of education in social sciences, provided by the World Bank experts' and the&#13;
Working Group of the Russian Government, the following eligibility criteria for participation in the&#13;
Window 1 of the Innovation Fund are established.&#13;
4.    In economics HEIs must satisfy one or more of the following criteria:&#13;
a.     enrolment and education of day-time students in the master degree program in economics;&#13;
b.    enrolment and education of day-time students in specialty 5216 "Economics";&#13;
c.    enrolment and education of day-time students in specialty 5223 "Information Systems in&#13;
Economics";&#13;
d.     enrolment and education of day-time students in specialty 0606 "World Economy;&#13;
e.    enrolment and education of day-time students in specialty 0601 "Theoretical economics";&#13;
f.     enrolment and education of day-time students in specialty 0607 "National economy";&#13;
g.     enrolment and education of day-time students in specialty 0618 "Mathematical methods&#13;
and operational research in economics";&#13;
5.    In sociology HEIs must satisfy one or more of the following criteria:&#13;
a.     enrolment and education of day-time students in the master degree program in sociology;&#13;
b.     enrolment and education of day-time students in specialty 0203 "Sociology";&#13;
c.    enrolment and education of day-time students in direction 5212 "Sociology".&#13;
6.    In political science HEIs must satisfy one or more of the following criteria:&#13;
a.     enrolment and education of day-time students in the master degree program in political&#13;
science;&#13;
b.     enrolment and education of day-time students in specialty 0202 "Political science";&#13;

c.     enrolment and education of day-time students in direction 5209 "Political science".&#13;
7.     Preliminary lists of HEls matching at least one of these criteria in each discipline (as of December&#13;
1996) are given in Tables 3-5.&#13;
8.     The list covers all major HEIs providing education in social science in Russia. The list also has&#13;
a broad geographical coverage, including HEIs from all major educational centers all over the country.&#13;
The list includes HEIs of different types: classical universities, HEIs specializing in social sciences,&#13;
pedagogical HEls and even some technical universities providing social sciences education. HEls included&#13;
in the list also represent a different size groups, from relatively small regional HEIs to the largest national&#13;
universities.&#13;

Education Innovation Project&#13;
ANNEX B&#13;
SCHOOL TEXTBOOK REFORM COMPONENT&#13;
1.    The following description of the current situation in Russian textbook creation and supply is based&#13;
on a series of studies which were carried out under the Project (the analysis of textbook procurement&#13;
funding in 26 Regions, availability of textbooks in 8 Regions, analysis of the composition and formation&#13;
process of the Federal list of textbooks etc.). Discussion of preliminary results at a representative&#13;
conference in Golytsino (November 1995), at a seminar for the heads of Regional Education Authorities&#13;
(Kaliningrad, February 1996), as well as meetings with selected education system workers, publishers&#13;
and experts have made it possible to draw an accurate picture of the current situation in textbook creation&#13;
and supply in Russia.&#13;
Availability of Textbooks in Second Cycle Schools&#13;
2.    A selective survey of the availability of textbooks in schools in various regions in Russia has&#13;
shown that schools are generally well-provided with the necessary number of textbooks with the exception&#13;
of certain individual disciplines (e.g., foreign languages). Despite this there are immediately underlying&#13;
factors presenting very serious threats to the quality of education offered to Russian children in the public&#13;
education system.&#13;
3.    A systemic undersupply of "Federal List" textbooks ordered by schools over the past three years&#13;
has resulted in a drastic increase in the average Me of textbooks which is now approaching the upper&#13;
limit of permitted and feasible use. Stocks are old and are now rapidly depleting. The implication is that&#13;
in the next one or two years textbooks will need replacing on a much heavier scale than at the old&#13;
optimum annual rate of 25 per cent. Further, the technical characteristics (especially binding) of some&#13;
recently published textbooks prohibit use for the full four year period. Such new textbooks are bound&#13;
to "paperback" standards, glued rather than sewn, thus reducing classroom durability and adding to&#13;
textbook needs.&#13;
4.    The need for a large scale replacement of textbooks is determined by qualitative as well as&#13;
quantitative factors. The content of some textbooks included in the Federal List is not consistent with&#13;
modern methodological requirements. This applies not only to human and social sciences. There are many&#13;
cases when there is a lack of continuity between different textbooks within a single course of study and&#13;
between courses. Many textbooks published over the past few years are not supported by the necessary&#13;
teachers', supplementary and resource books. Most textbooks are poorly illustrated and the quality of&#13;
printing is far below that of established foreign textbook systems. This is underlined by the conclusions&#13;
of the Project's analysis of the Federal list and with the results of an opinion poll conducted among&#13;
teachers in various regions.  These findings underline the need for greater choice and for more&#13;
coordinated publishing and evaluation programs.&#13;
5.    Research indicates a current requirement for new textbooks, new editions and reprints of available&#13;
textbooks at over 300 million units, at least double the "normal" annual need for textbook renewal. The&#13;
cost of materials and printing alone, of such a number, is of the order of $400 - 500 million at current&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 66                                                                          Annex B&#13;
prices excluding new textbook creation and promotion costs.&#13;
Funding Textbook Provision for Second Cycle Schools&#13;
6.    The MGPE estimates the optimum requirement for the Federal List of textbooks for schools in&#13;
the 1996/7 academic year at approximately R 1.5 trillion ($300 million). The differential between this&#13;
figure and that above is the result of conceptual difference - the Ministry is concerned only to replace&#13;
redundant stock while the total figure includes replacement of inappropriate, unsatisfactory and badly&#13;
produced titles.&#13;
7.    Textbook procurement will now be funded from the budgets of the Regional Education&#13;
Authorities. The Federal budget for 1996 includes R 500 billion ($100 million) of financial assistance&#13;
to the Regions for these purposes, which has been confirmed by Government Resolution. The&#13;
fundamental change in 1996 was that funds were provided directly to the Regions instead of the old&#13;
practice of channeling the budgetary loan (provided to the Regions) through the MGPE for the payment&#13;
of the centralized order. The new procedure makes it possible for any Region to order textbooks directly&#13;
or on a centralized basis through the MGPE if it finds this arrangement convenient and transfers the funds&#13;
to the MGPE.&#13;
8.    Regions raise funds variously, but primarily from their own budgets, debiting respective amounts&#13;
to Rayon budgets. In 1995, the ratio of Regions' own resources to loans from the Federal budget was&#13;
1:1. In 1996, the ratio was weighted heavily towards Regional budgets.&#13;
9.    Other financial sources are few. Contributions from sponsors and parents are difficult to estimate&#13;
because they are not centralized (contributions from parents are accumulated and remain at the school&#13;
level). Surveys indicate that from 20 to 40 per cent of parents could afford to pay for the set of textbooks&#13;
and individual regions (Kabardino-Balkaria for one) make successful use of this source. Loan schemes&#13;
for parents (where textbooks are lent for a small charge) or buy-back from parents at the end of the&#13;
academic year are not practiced.&#13;
10.   Sponsor contributions from international charity organizations, primarily the Soros Foundation,&#13;
are used to develop new textbooks rather than procure textbooks for schools. Most, perhaps the majority,&#13;
of recently published new textbooks have been created with the financial support of the Soros Foundation.&#13;
Institutional and Economic Description of the Textbook Publishing Sector&#13;
11.   As with nearly all Central and Eastern European countries Russia is in the early and most&#13;
traumatic stage of the transition from a centralized education and textbook supply system. The main&#13;
characteristics are:&#13;
*     A switch from a single-source to multichannel (central, regional, local, parents and sponsors)&#13;
financing of textbook procurement and delivery. Financing is already transferred from the&#13;
MGPE;&#13;
*     Development of decentralized ways of ordering textbooks. Direct contractual relations between&#13;
regions and publishing houses are gradually replacing the system of centralized orders&#13;
implemented by the MGPE;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Education Innovation Project                                    Page 67&#13;
*     An increase in the choice of textbooks and education programs;&#13;
*     Reduction of the textbook monopoly held by PROSVESCHENIYE and rapid reduction in&#13;
dependence on the State distribution monopoly of ROSKNIGA (with real and potential cost&#13;
benefits). There is a growing number of independent publishers. However, with one exception,&#13;
they still provide only a small percentage of the Federal list of textbooks.&#13;
The State of the Educational Book Market&#13;
12.    The textbook publishing sector has been substantially liberalized over the past few years as&#13;
follows: participation of independent publishers in the Federal List; availability of a choice within the&#13;
Federal List; multichannel funding; opportunities to sign direct contracts with publishers instead of the&#13;
system of centralized orders through the MGPE; open market prices for textbooks available in the&#13;
marketplace. As a result of general economic and MGPE reforms textbook publishing has become&#13;
substantially market-oriented.&#13;
13.   At the same time the education book (and related materials) market is still only at a formative&#13;
stage. The education market remains restricted, first of all, by the financial frailty of most of its major&#13;
participants (neither publisher nor customer have sufficient financial resources to ensure regular and stable&#13;
delivery of textbooks to schools), and secondly, by the lack of a well-developed market information&#13;
infrastructure permitting the consumer to access up-to-date information on textbooks published or in&#13;
preparation ,thus permitting the adequate consumer choice.&#13;
14.   The majority of education publishers are recently established with inadequate working capital&#13;
for the production of very large printings of textbooks. This is a particular problem for Russia in&#13;
comparison with East and Central Europe. Russia has a school population in excess of the total population&#13;
of any of those countries except Poland.&#13;
15.   High interest rates and low levels of collateral make the financing of the massive printings of&#13;
books in the Federal list especially daunting. Unless this is redressed there will remain a serious threat&#13;
of either continued monopoly or a proliferation of smaller regional publishers working on smaller&#13;
printings. In either case choice and quality standards will suffer in the medium term. Currently&#13;
prepayment covering the cost of paper and printing is the only way for publishing houses to produce long&#13;
print runs. Lack of funding resources in the Regions and the stressed financial position of most publishing&#13;
houses, arrears of payment and the need to maintain low prices do not permit publishers to earn the added&#13;
value necessary to build up working capital and to effectively promote their textbooks on the market.&#13;
16.   What is now by far the largest customer group, the Regional Education Authorities, also has&#13;
problems of resourcing and timing the funding for textbooks. Some, in the Moscow and Petersburg&#13;
Regions for example, are well funded, others are not. Funds for the procurement of textbooks are not,&#13;
in most cases, allocated on a systematic basis. In the absence of a clear regulatory framework defining&#13;
responsibilities and specifying the financial source for the provision of textbooks to schools, regional&#13;
administrations sometimes wait for subsidies and centralized loans from the Federal Budget before&#13;
allocating funds for textbooks from their own budgets. Given the seasonal nature of the textbook market&#13;
and the production cycle that implies (particularly if prepayment must be made) the present system does&#13;
not guarantee sustainable provision of textbooks. There is some evidence that at least some regions are&#13;
aware of this and are taking measures which may partially redress this situation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 68                                                                            Annex B&#13;
17.   The financial weakness of all the major market participants (publishers, printers, Regions and&#13;
schools) makes it very difficult to develop an infrastructure capable of furnishing the consumer with the&#13;
required information on the availability of existing and forthcoming textbooks. The increasing variety of&#13;
textbooks and methodological approaches and the opportunity for informed selection have created demand&#13;
for much more information on which to base orders for textbooks. Information on price, terms of&#13;
delivery and payment, series continuity, teachers', supplementary and resource materials etc. all needs&#13;
to be available in a consolidated and accessible form.&#13;
The Role of the Federal Authorities in Managing the Development of the Textbook Publishing System&#13;
18.   The transformation of the textbook publishing system is not a controlled process. The MGPE&#13;
has neither the resources nor the leverage necessary to manage educational materials development or&#13;
quality control:&#13;
*     There is no legislative framework ensuring that schools use books consistent with approved&#13;
programs and required technical standards. Publishers entering the market rarely have experience&#13;
of publishing textbooks for schools incorporating these requirements. Roskompechat and&#13;
(theoretically) the Bureau of Sanitary Epidemiological Surveillance are nominally responsible for&#13;
maintenance of standards but there is no legislative framework for such monitoring. Neither the&#13;
Federal Expert Council, charged with maintenance of textbook standards, nor the MGPE has&#13;
clear authority to do this. Under the Law on Education teachers are free to select education&#13;
literature for teaching his/her subject. Even the Federal list can be imposed only through central&#13;
purchase or the traditional respect in which it is held.&#13;
*     A methodological framework is not in place. Neither National Education Standards nor testing&#13;
systems have been applied. The procedure for the creation and updating of the Federal List is&#13;
insufficiently transparent and objective. The Federal list is not an integrated system, but merely&#13;
an order form for the centralized supply of textbooks to be supplied in the current the year. The&#13;
compilation of the Federal list is unsystematic. The Federal Expert Council does not have an&#13;
objective basis for selecting textbooks (National Education Standards) and makes&#13;
recommendations to approve (or disapprove) textbooks without clear connection to the whole&#13;
education literature package in a given discipline. Nor does it apply consistent criteria or numeric&#13;
scoring to ensure objectivity and comparability or evaluate design and production quality and&#13;
price. It is common for a teacher who starts using a new textbook to find no consistent follow-up&#13;
textbook for the next academic year encouraging conservative choice of well-tried but outdated&#13;
materials with consequent constraint on educational development;&#13;
*     There is no sustainable financial basis for resolving these problems. If the responsibility for&#13;
improving the quality of educational materials is vested in the Federal Authorities then the federal&#13;
budget must have provisions for the effective formation of the Federal List, including preparation&#13;
of innovative textbook programs, the issue and testing of pilot and trial editions, retraining of&#13;
teachers and so on. Such funds are not available.&#13;
Implications and Dangers&#13;
19.   On the basis of the above analysis it can be seen that without the legal, institutional and financial&#13;
means to enable the Federal Government to influence development of a market based educational&#13;
materials supply sector there are numerous potentially negative implications.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Education Innovation Project                                  Page 69&#13;
*     Potential deterioration of the quality of education and of the common education space as schools&#13;
turn to "local" or cheaper low-quality textbooks inconsistent Federal education and hygienic&#13;
standards;&#13;
*     Deterioration of the quality of textbooks and course materials. Retention of out-dated and inferior&#13;
materials in the absence of tested, innovative new materials;&#13;
*     Intensification of uncontrolled blackmarket trends in the textbook publishing sector (piracy,&#13;
spurious recommendations, hijacking of authors and other typical negative features of&#13;
uncontrolled change);&#13;
*     Lowering of standards of production and design and of durability. Use of inappropriate materials&#13;
and printing machinery. Eventual increase in total system cost and adverse effect on children's&#13;
wellbeing;&#13;
*     Inability to achieve National Education Standards on a consistent, nationwide base due to poor&#13;
textbooks;&#13;
*     Encouragement of diverse and centrifugal curricula and textbook content undermining the high&#13;
common standards of school education;&#13;
a     Continuation of the central monopoly because only one real competitor to the State Publishing&#13;
House has emerged&#13;
Summary Conclusions and Recommendations&#13;
20.   In order to speed up the reform of the textbook publishing sector, improve the quality of&#13;
education and avert the dangerous consequences of uncontrolled transition processes it is necessary to:&#13;
*     Strengthen and improve the role of the Federal authorities in the process of directing the&#13;
development of market based textbook publishing as a common national resource center ensuring&#13;
the development of the methodological basis of education, improvements in textbook quality, the&#13;
awareness of national standards and compliance with these;&#13;
*     Create improved economic conditions for the operation and development of the textbook&#13;
publishing market by facilitating the formation of market infrastructures and strengthening major&#13;
participants;&#13;
*     Take urgent steps to ensure mass replacement of worn-out and/or outdated textbooks.&#13;
21.   Additional expenditure from the Federal and Regional budgets will be required during the&#13;
transition period that will permit:&#13;
*     Establishment of a market information infrastructure;&#13;
*     Renewal of the content of education by developing and publishing textbooks consistent with&#13;
contemporary requirements;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

*     The formation of an institutional and methodological basis for preserving the common education&#13;
space in the textbook field thus providing a nationwide impact on the quality of education;&#13;
Project Objectives and Tasks&#13;
22.   The proposed Education Innovation Project would have a component which would be a modest&#13;
step in addressing the complexities of supply and demand in the textbook market in Russia. The School&#13;
Textbook Reform Component would improve the quality and supply of textbooks through: the provision&#13;
of electronic information and book ordering systems; training and equipment for both the MGPE and&#13;
regional educational administrations. The project would, in addition, strengthen educational standards&#13;
and create new textbook titles; and equity of access to timely information on new and improved textbooks&#13;
throughout the RF for schools, parents and students.&#13;
Specific Project Tasks&#13;
*     To establish a logical system of authority, responsibility and accountability of, respectively, the&#13;
Federal and Regional Education Authorities concerning the choice, purchase and supply of&#13;
textbooks and other educational literature for secondary schools;&#13;
*     To establish a system for textbook quality monitoring including Federal list renewal and&#13;
replacement and extension consistent with increased choice of books and other educational&#13;
options;&#13;
*     To establish a nationwide market information infrastructure that would ensure directed and&#13;
rational decision-making in textbook ordering together with real time interaction between&#13;
customers and producers.&#13;
*     To train  education managers and practitioners in the use of the textbook ordering and&#13;
information system.&#13;
Subcomponent One: Textbook Quality Improvement&#13;
23.   The improvement and development of the system of National Education Standards is a key&#13;
Subproject whose principal task in the context of general textbook reform is to establish a basis for a&#13;
consistent development of the education content, an objective system of textbook quality assurance and&#13;
a purposeful updating and extension of the Federal list of Textbooks.&#13;
24.   The subcomponent aims to further the work on Standards already initiated by the Russian&#13;
Government.  It is directed towards the solution of: (a) the key conceptual issues; and (b) the&#13;
experimental trialling of major mechanisms to establish, put in place and periodically review and update&#13;
national educational standards and the examinations/tests related to them. The subcomponent is expected&#13;
to provide a plan for the establishment and institutional framework for a nationally acceptable system of&#13;
standards and tests.&#13;
25.   The project would analyze the current status of the National System of Standards and Tests and&#13;
would formulate ways to improve and develop the National System of Standards and related Tests. Based&#13;
on international experience, it would help to prepare and pilot models for standards and associated tests&#13;
for selected disciplines and education levels. The project would also seek to identify user requirements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Education Innovation Project                                 Page 71&#13;
in for both secondary and higher education products, as well as the requirements of education literature&#13;
creators (authors, publishers) of the system of standards and tests. Procedures for the development,&#13;
approval and periodic updating of the system of standards and tests would be developed.&#13;
26.   The other part of this subcomponent would address the evaluation and validation of textbooks and&#13;
other educational materials through the managerial and technical reform of the Federal Expert Council.&#13;
This reform would focus on the development of revised functions for the Federal Expert Council which&#13;
would create a more effective and nationally respected and understood Approved list. This Approved&#13;
List would, in turn, provide the basis for the Federal List and, eventually, become the only list from&#13;
which schools could obtain guidance in choosing their textbooks. It is assumed that the Federal Expert&#13;
Council would resume its developmental role in textbook and curriculum innovation; and that the Council&#13;
and the Ministry of General and Professional Education would have complementary functions in the&#13;
creation and dissemination of information on textbooks approval and the structure and use of the&#13;
Approved List.&#13;
27.   The project would address the restructuring of the Council to include: the introduction of a Board&#13;
of Management with improved operational methods and equipment; the revision and enhancement of the&#13;
evaluation methods of the Council to ensure more transparent, objective and comparable standards of&#13;
evaluation;the introduction of specific procedures for the selection of evaluators; the introduction of&#13;
numerically based weighted criteria for evaluation; the evaluation of design and production standards and&#13;
of prices; and substantial training in all these areas;&#13;
Subcomponent Two: Renewal of the Federal List&#13;
28.   The analysis of textbooks recommended by the Ministry of General and professional Education&#13;
(the Federal list of Textbooks) will permit identification of courses and subjects which lack textbooks&#13;
and/or are in need of renewal. It will also provide for the revision of the Federal list of Textbooks with&#13;
potential to exclude those textbooks which are outdated and do not correspond to modern requirements,&#13;
textbooks which are not supported by the requisite methodological and supplementary materials, textbooks&#13;
which prevent the development of methodologically integrated curricula on given subjects, and of&#13;
textbooks which are not coordinated with the other textbooks at the same levels.&#13;
29.   In addition to the main objective, the analysis of the Federal list of Textbooks will also facilitate&#13;
certain functions in terms of the project implementation as a whole. First, the analysis is intended to&#13;
identify a list of textbooks which are in the greatest need of being replaced, and of subjects which need&#13;
a more varied choice of textbooks within the limits of the Federal list. These lists will be used in the&#13;
process of a competition to develop new educational literature. Second, in the course of the analysis, a&#13;
methodology will be tested for a comprehensive evaluation of textbooks with a potential for subsequent&#13;
use in practical activities of the Federal Expert Council.&#13;
30.   This subcomponent would address the need for "new generation" textbooks through the&#13;
application of a competitive selection process for grants for manuscript development by authors and for&#13;
pre-press and promotional/informational work by publishers. Following this selection, competitive bidding&#13;
to produce the new titles would be organized for publishing houses selected on experience and merit.&#13;
Successful bidders would obtain the right to publish the new textbooks and receive grants for the&#13;
preparation of final film, additional materials, issue and dissemination of pilot printings and/or promotion&#13;
of the new books on the market (advertisement, seminars, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 72                                                                          Annex B&#13;
31.   The competition for the development of new textbooks will:&#13;
*     provide for a significant updating and extension of the Federal list (tentatively, 4 cycles of 30-40&#13;
titles each; 150 new titles upon the completion of the Project);&#13;
*     develop a model for interaction between the Ministry, authors, publishers and Federal Expert&#13;
Council to develop textbooks and to improve the quality of education literature;&#13;
*     accelerate authors' and publishers' experience in working in market conditions in both the&#13;
textbook development and distribution sectors;&#13;
*     test, on a pilot basis, new methods for integrated evaluation of textbooks to be developed in the&#13;
course of the project;&#13;
*     promote demonopolization of the textbook publishing market through assisting new publishers&#13;
to establish themselves on the market.&#13;
Subcomponent Three: Textbook Information System&#13;
32.   This subcomponent has two main elements aimed at improving information and choice. It would&#13;
ensure that teachers have access to new textbooks and programs, and that regions have an opportunity&#13;
to make reasonable selections and orders for textbooks.&#13;
33.   One of the most essential element of the textbook market development is the creation of an&#13;
information infrastructure providing the consumer and the contractor with complete and trustworthy&#13;
information about the educational literature available in the market. The need for the development of such&#13;
a data base and for its associated catalog is especially pressing as the textbook ordering function is&#13;
being transferred from the MGPE to the regions.&#13;
34.   At present, there are large numbers of databases and catalogs on education literature. They are&#13;
developed by governmental and non-governmental organizations including libraries, publishing houses,&#13;
and education establishments. However, there is no Master Catalog or Database containing the description&#13;
of all education books and the results of the evaluation reports of the Federal Expert Council. As a result&#13;
of the transition to a decentralized scheme of textbook order formation, the need for such publication is&#13;
great.&#13;
35.   The subcomponent would include the initiation and dissemination of a catalog of educational&#13;
materials in traditional and electronic formats. The development, publication and dissemination of the first&#13;
edition only (software and database development for the electronic version) would also be included.&#13;
Subsequent editions would be self-repaying, and designed to make a profit from advertising by publishers&#13;
and education materials suppliers.&#13;
36.   The project would finance:&#13;
*     the collection of information and the creation of a data base, including the development of&#13;
software and equipment of a center to deal with the data base;&#13;
*     creation of data base updating system;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Education Innovation Project                                 Page 73&#13;
*     development, commercial production and circulation and the first edition of the "Catalog of&#13;
textbooks available for sale".&#13;
37.   The second part of this subcomponent would be the development of a National Textbook Ordering&#13;
Network, a computer network created to link education authorities starting from, the Rayon level, to&#13;
disseminate and exchange information on textbooks and education literature. Publishing houses, libraries&#13;
and pedagogical education institutions would be encouraged to join the network. The system would&#13;
increase teachers' access to new textbooks and programs, and provide the regions with an opportunity&#13;
to make reasonable selections in placing textbook orders.&#13;
38.   The project would finance:&#13;
*     A review of the current technological conditions of regional communication networks, identifying&#13;
the amount and nature of information transmitted, etc.;&#13;
*     Selection of optimal technological decisions. Tentatively, it seems better to divide information&#13;
flows into two channels. In this case information from the center to the regions could be delivered&#13;
using teletext technologies which would make it economically and technologically accessible&#13;
throughout Russia. The counterflow of information from users to the center and exchange of&#13;
information could be arranged using conventional telephone lines on the basis of a Russian&#13;
telecommunication system.&#13;
*     Selection of hardware and software;&#13;
e     Development of a time schedule for the establishment and introduction of the system;&#13;
3     Development and formation of the system's institutional structure, including the establishment of&#13;
a Data Center to collect, process, store and transmit information;&#13;
3     Project implementation proper, including equipment procurement and installation, personnel&#13;
training, etc.&#13;
Sub-component Four: Training&#13;
39.   This subcomponent would support  training programs for regional and local education&#13;
administrators in new market-led textbook ordering and information systems. It would concentrate on&#13;
exchange of experience and dissemination of information on resolving the problems of textbook provision&#13;
for schools (contractual relations, use of additional resources, ways to reduce textbook prices, delivery&#13;
and dissemination costs, use of local capacities etc. together with methods of fund raising).  Some&#13;
indication of the number of personnel who would require retraining can be obtained from the number&#13;
of Rayon Education Departments (2500), together with Central and Regional Education Departments and&#13;
Ministries, Teachers' Retraining Centers and Pedagogical Universities and Departments and by the size&#13;
of the country.&#13;
Commitments by Government Necessary for Project Implementation&#13;
40.   The projects described in this memorandum can not be successfully implemented without the&#13;
commitment in principle by the GOR to a number of measures related to the preservation and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

enhancement of nationwide standards of school education. These are:&#13;
*     Clarification of the respective roles of the Federal and Regional Governments in textbook&#13;
creation, evaluation and supply. The regions are now responsible from their own budgets&#13;
(whether or not centrally supported) for the purchase and supply of school textbooks. The&#13;
maintenance of all-Russian textbook quality can only be effected through institutions which are&#13;
centrally based - specifically the MGPE and the Federal Expert Council. Without prejudice to the&#13;
content of local curricula or the submission of local materials for evaluation this should be agreed&#13;
between the central and regional authorities and made clear to schools.&#13;
*     Re-structuring of the Federal Expert Council: To ensure nationwide acceptance of quality&#13;
standards of textbooks approved and recommended for use in schools both the status and&#13;
operational basis of the Federal Expert Council require reform and the Council's work to have&#13;
a much higher public profile.&#13;
Expected Outputs and Efficiency of the Project&#13;
41.   The School Textbook Reform Component of the Education Loan has an integrated and&#13;
multipurpose nature. Its implementation should also have an integrated impact on the current problems&#13;
of supply, quality and financing of textbooks in the Russian compulsory education system. In assessing&#13;
project efficiency it is necessary to consider:&#13;
X     it is a pilot project (bearing in mind the size of Russia and the loan) which is mainly aimed at&#13;
developing new market related models and schemes in the textbook publishing sector;&#13;
*     The Project is not expected to revolutionize the textbook publishing sector but, within the sector's&#13;
existing trends, to speed up an already initiated process. It is designed to reduce the negative&#13;
aspects of the transition period and make the it more controllable and efficient.&#13;
Institutional Changes&#13;
*     A new scheme of textbook ordering for schools will be established under which customers/regions&#13;
have direct contractual relations with producers/publishers;&#13;
*     A modern information infrastructure is established for the textbook publishing market under&#13;
which customers have complete information on educational books and related materials available&#13;
on the market and an opportunity to maintain real-time contact with producers.&#13;
*     The process of new textbook development and approval restructured to guarantee openness and&#13;
textbook quality monitoring by the education community. This will increase the authority of the&#13;
Approved and (if retained) Federal Lists as a major component of the common education space.&#13;
Social (Educational System) Effects&#13;
*     A new model for Approved List creation, monitoring and updating is tested which meets present-&#13;
day conditions and the requirements of the democratic society which will:&#13;
*     facilitate the preservation of the common education space despite differences in school type and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Russian Federation: Education Innovation Project                                 Page 75&#13;
national and regional diversity;&#13;
*     guarantee the quality of education despite many variables and the free choice of teaching methods;&#13;
*     form the basis for the elaboration and development of curricula and provide objective assessment&#13;
of new textbooks and the Approved List.&#13;
*     improve the objectivity of the textbook and manuscript evaluation procedure on the basis of a&#13;
more formal set of criteria;&#13;
*     guarantee the integrity of the textbooks included in the Approved List and increase the publishing,&#13;
variety and availability of new methodological and supplementary materials;&#13;
*     Strengthen the means whereby the Federal education authorities and the wider education&#13;
community can contribute to creating a methodological center responsible for maintaining and&#13;
improving the quality of education.&#13;
*     The process of outdated textbook replacement and increase in the choice of educational options&#13;
will be accelerated (it is assumed that 150 new textbooks would be created and issued over 4&#13;
years within the framework of the project). This will form the basis for a fundamental&#13;
improvement in the quality of education.&#13;
Economic Effects&#13;
*     The devolution of customers' functions to oblast education authorities simultaneously with&#13;
implementation of a nationwide retraining program will facilitate reduction of both financial and&#13;
time costs associated with textbook provision for schools by:&#13;
*     professional compilation of orders and contract-making between regions and publishers;&#13;
*     use of market mechanisms to reduce the cost of delivery and attract additional financial&#13;
resources;&#13;
*     Make economies through more efficient use of local structures and capacities.&#13;
Project Administration&#13;
42.   The management of the School Textbook Reform component has two features: firstly it is an&#13;
integrated project which assumes a coordinated implementation of five relatively independent&#13;
subcomponents. Therefore, the availability of a specialized structure for operational project management&#13;
is critical to its successful implementation; secondly it is a pilot project which requires analysis of project&#13;
progress and mid-term results, together with continuous intensive monitoring of the project in relation&#13;
to changing Russian conditions.&#13;
43.   The project assumes several competitions and/or sets of bidding. Results of most subcomponents&#13;
will be subject to review and general discussion and comment within the education community.&#13;

Institutional Functions and Tasks&#13;
a.     Preparation of documents defining competitions and bidding conditions, selection&#13;
principles and criteria, expert and selection committee formation and operation&#13;
procedures;&#13;
b.     Organization of bidding: establishment of expert and selection committees, publication&#13;
of bidding information, collection of bids and materials, routine work with bidders,&#13;
expert committee support, etc.;&#13;
c.    signing contracts with the executors of individual subcomponents and supervision of their&#13;
implementation: timing, compliance with TORs, quality (based on reviews);&#13;
d.     Holding seminars to discuss the results of individual subcomponents;&#13;
e.     Organization of the implementation of the retraining program;&#13;
f.     Coordination and synchronization of activities conducted within individual sub-projects.&#13;
44.   Analytical Functions and Tasks&#13;
a.     Assessment of progress in the implementation of the project and its individual parts,&#13;
preparation of reports and analytical notes for a Strategy Committee (or any other body&#13;
to be established by Governmental Resolution to manage the project);&#13;
b.    Analysis and forecasting of the situation in textbook publishing, institutional and&#13;
economic conditions affecting project implementation and machinery for project&#13;
adjustments.'&#13;
45.   Financial and Economic Functions and Tasks&#13;
a.     Management of funds allocated for individual project components;&#13;
b.     Analysis, audit and reporting under the budget of the project and its components;&#13;
c.     Analysis of estimates and budgets submitted by executors under individual project&#13;
components and search for ways to reduce costs;&#13;
d.    Compliance monitoring of the schedule of interest payment and loan repayment from&#13;
internal project sources;&#13;
The need for such a function is dictated by the rate of changes in the secondary education system, as&#13;
well as economy and legislation as a whole which is typical of the transition period.&#13;

Technical Functions and Tasks&#13;
46.   One of the project elements, the establishment of the computer network to disseminate and&#13;
exchange information on available textbooks and order education literature, includes the procurement of&#13;
a large quantity of equipment. Such a large-scale procurement of technologically interrelated versatile&#13;
machinery requires special attention to avoid technical omissions with potential serious financial losses,&#13;
or vice versa, where professional solutions might deliver significant savings and quality improvement.&#13;
Similar, smaller scale, situations may affect other components.&#13;
"External Political" Functions and Tasks&#13;
a.     A number of project components assume decision-making at the federal level (national&#13;
education standards and testing, Federal Expert Council). The preparation and timely&#13;
adoption of such decisions requires intensive work in collaboration with responsible&#13;
governmental departments;&#13;
b.     One of the project's major objectives is to assist the democratic reform of education in&#13;
Russia. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain close contacts with the education&#13;
community in the course of project implementation, involving the widest circles of the&#13;
community in project implementation.&#13;

RUSSLAN FEDERATION&#13;
Education Innovation Project&#13;
ANNEX C&#13;
PILOT TEXTBOOK PROCUREMENT FUND&#13;
Textbook Publishing - Background&#13;
1.    The decision that the Federal Budget would no longer finance centralized procurement of textbook&#13;
publishing and a gradual devolution of funding responsibilities to the regional level has brought about&#13;
institutional changes in the purchasing and financing of new textbooks for secondary schools. The MGPE&#13;
previously selected books to be published and distributed to schools, based upon the aggregation of&#13;
orders from school systems nation-wide, and organized the publication of these books by placing direct&#13;
orders to particular publishing houses. This system led to a lag of two years between the selection of texts&#13;
at the school level and the delivery of textbooks. Today, regions have assumed responsibility for selecting&#13;
and paying for secondary school textbooks and they now select titles and place orders for these texts&#13;
directly with publishers. While the time gap between ordering and delivery has been reduced, there&#13;
remain several serious impediments to both textbook updating and the development of a competitive&#13;
publishing industry. These include (inter alia) barriers to entry of new publishers and a general lack of&#13;
incentives to develop, publish and purchase new textbooks.&#13;
Issues&#13;
Textbook Supply&#13;
2.    Prosveschenie Publishing House, a state-owned company which published 100% of education&#13;
literature for secondary schools before 1993, still holds a near-monopoly in the Russian textbook&#13;
publishing market. Moreover, now that public control over textbook publishing is reduced, the&#13;
underdeveloped market allows Prosveschenie to issue outdated education literature rather than new books&#13;
which would incur additional costs in order to comply with international standards and stricter&#13;
requirements concerning textbook printing design. The ability of Prosveschenie to issue old textbooks,&#13;
for which it has sole copyright, at relatively low prices still gives it substantial market power . This&#13;
situation deters the development of new textbooks and therefore inhibits curriculum reform.&#13;
3.    Some regions have sought to break this monopoly by directing business to a new single publisher&#13;
at the local or oblast level so as to capture the local education literature market with a local company.&#13;
Often these companies are interested only in gaining a foothold in the market not in improving textbook&#13;
quality or in developing new textbooks; therefore they prefer to "buy over" authors of existing&#13;
textbooks.&#13;
4.    On a national level, one large private publishing house has begun to compete with Prosveschnie.&#13;
These two houses together dominate the market and own the copyrights for about 90 % of all textbooks&#13;
included in the Federal Set. The other 10% are published by small independent firms specializing in&#13;
education literature. The success of these publishers in issuing high-quality textbooks at relatively low&#13;
prices indicates the possibility of change but a much greater effort is necessary to bring about sustainable&#13;
reform.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Education Innovation Project                                   Page 79&#13;
Lack of Working Capital for Publishers&#13;
5.    The development of competition is impeded by the financial inability of new independent&#13;
publishers to publish mass print-runs of their textbooks, since the time gap between the payment of&#13;
materials and printing costs (which constitute 80% of the textbook cost) and payments by customers is&#13;
at least 4-6 months. Moreover, many regions do not pay promptly. These publishers find it difficult to&#13;
borrow working capital. Interest rates are generally in excess of 48 % in rubles or about 25% in hard&#13;
currency while inflation was approximately 22% in 1996. Even at these rates, publishers face difficulty&#13;
in obtaining loans due to: (i) a lack of assets which could be used as security for loans taken to issue a&#13;
mass print-run; (ii) delays in customers' payments, particularly where the customer is a regional&#13;
administration; and (iii) a lack of interest by the banking sector in financing Russian enterprises in general&#13;
due to more favorable opportunities, at least until recently, to earn high rates of return buying&#13;
government securities. The reduction of the bank interest rate for commercial loans that is expected in&#13;
the coming year due to the greater macroeconomic stabilization and the opening up of the government&#13;
debt market to foreigners, may help somewhat. However, access of small publishers to loans would still&#13;
be limited by their lack of assets for collateral.&#13;
Demand for Textbooks&#13;
6.    Regions are also constrained in the purchase of new textbook titles by a general lack of finance.&#13;
Even when federal funds have been made available for textbooks, anecdotal evidence suggests that such&#13;
funds are used for other purposes such as salary payments to teachers. Less than half of the funds&#13;
allocated to the regions were actually transferred to publishers as payments for textbooks. No mechanism&#13;
exists which could guarantee a "fair" distribution of the funds between the regions.&#13;
Summary&#13;
7.    While the prerequisites for establishing a competitive textbook market (education liberalization,&#13;
an opportunity for users to select textbooks and programs, transition to direct relations between customers&#13;
and producers, etc.) are theoretically in place, the market is actually split between two companies. This&#13;
situation inhibits textbook updating (and, hence, curricular reform), restricts choice, has a detrimental&#13;
effect on the quality of printing design and threatens unwarranted price increases for textbooks.&#13;
Pilot Textbook Procurement Fund&#13;
8.     This component would finance the purchase of textbooks for any region desiring such assistance.&#13;
The objective of the fund would be to assist selected regions to obtain textbooks in a manner which would&#13;
contribute towards: (a) overcoming barriers to entry by assuring payments to publishers and by&#13;
structuring payments in a manner that addresses working capital requirements; (b) the more competitive&#13;
selection of textbooks and the eventual demonopolization of the textbook publishing industry; (c) speeding&#13;
up the development and selection of new, more appropriate texts for secondary schools and (d) the&#13;
creation of a sustainable system of funding for textbook supply for the secondary education system.&#13;
Operation of the Pilot Fund&#13;
9.    Under the proposed scheme, regions wishing to purchase textbooks funded by the IBRD loan&#13;
would engage in a Sub Loan Agreement (SLA) with the MOF. All loans to regions would be guaranteed&#13;
by the oblast under the terms of an SLA (Attachment 1). It is proposed to allow interested regions to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 80                                                                         Annex C&#13;
borrow from the fund on the basis of SLAs available and ready for execution.&#13;
10.    It is anticipated that 70% of the fund would be allocated to depressed or needy Regions. Criteria&#13;
for the selection of regions will be included in the Operations Manual. It is expected that all participating&#13;
regions would have available: (a) a regional program/plan for the supply of textbooks; (b) a local&#13;
infrastructure for textbook supply to include a system of data collection about school needs and a local&#13;
distribution/delivery system; (c) a history of direct contracting with publishers in 1995-1996; and (d)&#13;
some availability of budgetary funds for textbook purchases in 1996. Detailed selection criteria will also&#13;
include the oblast's credit history with the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
11.   The purpose of the fund is to encourage the entry of new firms and develop new mechanisms of&#13;
book selection, marketing and purchase but not to provide so much finance as to create a dependence on&#13;
public finance. If the fund finances 2 textbook runs per year at a cost of $2.50 per book, it would only&#13;
finance approximately 4 million books per year and, over 5 years, 20 million books. This would represent&#13;
about 1 % of the total requirement estimated by the MGPE.&#13;
12.   In order to ensure that budgetary support for textbooks is actually spent on textbooks and to&#13;
continue encouraging new publishers, the MOF intends to deposit funds repaid by regions from the US$&#13;
10 million component into a designated account and continue funding textbooks from it. In this way, it&#13;
will function as a revolving fund. It is expected that MOF will operate this fund for about 4 to 5 years.&#13;
Thereafter, the US$ 10 million equivalent fund can be replaced by the funds of commercial banks and/or&#13;
donor agencies.&#13;
Selection and Procurement of Textbooks&#13;
13.   In order not to delay purchasing textbooks during the first two years of the project (while awaiting&#13;
the development and updating of textbooks under Component B: School Textbook Reform), participating&#13;
Regions would select textbooks from the existing Federal Textbook List approved by the project analysis.&#13;
14.   The procurement procedures to be used to obtain the textbooks would follow the Bank's&#13;
established procedures and as set forth in the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for Procurement of&#13;
Textbooks dated January 1994 and\or other agreed procedures which are described in the Bank's&#13;
Procurement Technical Note (PTN 4.4.1) of the same date (note: please refer to Corrigenda dated March&#13;
17, 1995). Although the Bank's Standard Bidding Document is intended for International Competitive&#13;
Bidding, the PTN discusses a number of different approaches to textbook supply contracts, some of which&#13;
would be expected to be used in this proposed project. The type of procurement would depend on, inter&#13;
alia, the size of proposed contract(s) and type of textbooks selected. Bank guidelines would introduce&#13;
competition into the selection process - where copyright problems exist the procurement process would&#13;
at least require negotiation with publishers to reduce prices and/or require regions to choose between 2&#13;
or 3 similar textbooks from the existing Federal List concerning certain specified subjects. The Textbook&#13;
Project in Romania provides useful lessons from experience in exactly this kind of selection and&#13;
procurement exercise.&#13;
Administration of the pilot Fund&#13;
15.   The NTF will work with regions to ensure that they follow Bank procurement guidelines and&#13;
develop contracts eligible for financing. To collect payments from regions and re-lend funds in the future,&#13;
MOF will appoint an agent bank. The agent bank will handle all financial details of the "revolving fund".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Education Innovation Project                               Page 81&#13;
The NTF will prepare documents and select an agent bank through a competitive bidding basis on behalf&#13;
of the MOF. An agreement would be signed with the selected agent bank which would determine the&#13;
functions, rights and responsibilities of the parties involved; the level, source and procedures for&#13;
remuneration; and the agent bank's reporting obligations to the MOF.&#13;
Cost of Pilot Fund for Textbooks&#13;
16.   The financing of this proposed US$10 million component would follow the Bank's normal&#13;
arrangements with the Bank financing up to 80 % of the cost of the component, with the Government local&#13;
cost sharing representing 20% and applicable duties and taxes.&#13;
Cost Recovery&#13;
17.   The interest rate to be charged to the regions would be established by the MOF at a rate which&#13;
would cover the World Bank Loan servicing, the fund's administration costs (bank's services) and, if&#13;
necessary, loan securities. It is tentatively estimated that the annual interest rate of such loans would be&#13;
10% in hard currency.&#13;
18.   The regions would repay the MOF as specified in the Sub Loan Agreement. To the extent&#13;
possible, repayment would be timed to coincide with release of budget funds which would be desirable&#13;
from the regions' point of view.&#13;
Monitoring&#13;
19.   To monitor the progress of the project, an annual review of the Fund will be undertaken by&#13;
independent advisers, including an expert nominated by the Bank. This review will be prepared by the&#13;
beneficiaries themselves on the progress of the project using inter alia the indicators listed in Annex E.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX D&#13;
PROJECT ADMINISTRATION- ORGANIZATION OF THE NTF&#13;
1.    The NTF would administer the Project on behalf of the MOF. It would be responsible for&#13;
ensuring that the Agreement between the Government and the WB would be carried out in an efficient&#13;
and effective manner and would ensure a common and consistent approach regarding the implementation&#13;
of the project by all participating entities. The NTF would act on behalf of the MOF in all routine&#13;
matters pertaining to the administration of the project. It would, inter alia, act as the secretariat of the&#13;
Expert Committees, administer the Special Account, manage and monitor all procurement activities&#13;
including the signing of contracts [HEI's may be authorized to sign for Innovative Funds with NTF&#13;
monitoring], requests for authorized payments and withdrawals from the Loan proceeds and the [Project&#13;
Account] and the consolidation and transmission of all reports and other applicable correspondence to the&#13;
WB.&#13;
2.    The NTF was originally developed with financing for the Bank's Management and Training&#13;
Project (Loan No. 3824-RU) with co-financing from the Swiss Government. It was established under&#13;
a Founding Agreement, dated September 7, 1994, as a non-governmental, non-profit organization and&#13;
was registered by the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation on September 29, 1994 (Registration&#13;
No. YuR-8)]. Its activities are governed by the Russian Federation laws; Russia's inter-governmental&#13;
agreements; the Founding Agreement and Charter; and the Foundation's internal regulations, which have&#13;
been reviewed by WB staff and found satisfactory. The NTF's original mandate under the Management&#13;

ANNEX H&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
1.    The proposed Education Innovation Project is designed to:&#13;
(a)   improve, in selected Higher Education Institutions, the quality and quantity of social&#13;
science education and encourage better governance systems and efficiency in the use of&#13;
resources; and&#13;
(b)   improve the quality and availability of school textbooks as a major contribution to&#13;
educational reform.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.    The proposed project would have three components: (a) Higher Education Innovation Fund; (b)&#13;
School Textbook Reform; and (c) Pilot Textbook Procurement Fund.&#13;
Higher Education Innovation Fund Component ($50 million)&#13;
3.    This component would encourage the reform of selected Higher Education Institutes and would&#13;
demonstrate how to effect considerable savings to the federal budget without loss of quality by, for&#13;
example, amalgamating non-efficient institutions; improving teaching methods; encouraging reduced&#13;
teacher-student ratios, strengthening social science education, promoting greater efficiency in use of public&#13;
funds at HEI level through increased accountability and transparency.&#13;
4.    This component would establish an Innovation Fund which would focus on the development of&#13;
social sciences and governance and management reform and would offer partly repayable grants based&#13;
on the result of a competitive process between higher education institutions. Conditions of application and&#13;
selection criteria would be publicized and awards would be determined in a transparent manner.&#13;
5.    The Innovation Fund would be a non-profit making, grant dispersing body in which the main&#13;
stakeholder is the higher education sector of Russia which is fully represented at all levels of management&#13;
of the IF. Other major stakeholders (MGPE, Ministry of Economy and Ministry of Finance) are&#13;
represented in the governance of the IF. Grants from the Innovation Fund are to be used in a manner&#13;
consistent with the principles outlined in the Loan Agreement and awarded in accordance with agreed&#13;
criteria.&#13;
School Textbook Reform Component (US$20 million)&#13;
6.    This component would be a modest step in addressing the complexities of supply and demand in&#13;
the textbook market in Russia. It would improve the quality and supply of textbooks through (a) the&#13;
provision of training and equipment for both the MOE and regional educational administrations to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 98                                                                       Annex H&#13;
strengthen educational standards and create new textbook titles; and (b) the establishment of electronic&#13;
information and book ordering systems which would provide equity of access to timely information on&#13;
new and improved textbooks throughout the RF for schools, parents and students.&#13;
Pilot Textbook Procurement Fund Component (US$10.0 million)&#13;
7.    The objective of the fund would be to assist selected regions to obtain textbooks tin a manner&#13;
which would contribute towards: (a) overcoming barriers to entry by assuring payments to publishers and&#13;
by structuring payments in a manner that addresses working capital requirements; (b) the more&#13;
competitive selection of textbooks and the eventual demonopolization of the textbook publishing industry;&#13;
(c) speeding up the development and selection of new, more appropriate texts for secondary schools; and&#13;
(d) the creation of a sustainable system of funding for textbook supply for the secondary education&#13;
system.&#13;
8.    School textbooks and learning materials would be procured through the Pilot Textbook&#13;
Procurement Fund. The MOF would on-lend the funds to participating regions with repayment to the&#13;
MOF through an agent bank. This would establish a revolving fund for future on-lending to regions by&#13;
the MOF.&#13;
C. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
9.    The NTF would administer the Project on behalf of the MOF. It would be responsible for&#13;
ensuring that the Agreement between the Government and the WB would be carried out in an efficient&#13;
and effective manner and would ensure a common and consistent approach regarding the implementation&#13;
of the project by all participating entities. The NTF would act on behalf of the MOF in all routine&#13;
matters pertaining to the administration of the project. It would, inter alia, act as the secretariat of the&#13;
various Committees, administer the Special Account, manage and monitor all procurement activities&#13;
including the signing of contracts (HEI's may be authorized to sign for Innovative Funds with NTF&#13;
assistance and oversight), requests for authorized payments and withdrawals from the Loan proceeds and&#13;
for the consolidation and transmission of all reports and other applicable correspondence to the WB.&#13;
10.   The NTF would be responsible for the developing and maintaining Volume III to the existing&#13;
NTF Operational Manual pertaining to the proposed project, containing eligibility criteria and appraisal,&#13;
approval and supervision rules and procedures for the grants and reimbursable programs, as well as other&#13;
administrative rules to be followed by the NTF in the carrying out of the project.&#13;
D. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
Gantt Chart (See following 6 pages)&#13;
E. MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
11.   To monitor the progress of the project, an annual review will be undertaken by independent&#13;
advisers, including an expert nominated by the Bank. This review will be based on a standardized report&#13;
to be prepared by the beneficiaries themselves on the progress of the project using inter alia the indicators&#13;
listed in Annex E.&#13;

            The objectives of the Education
            Innovation Project are to: (1) improve, in selected higher
            education institutions, the quality and quantity of social
            science education and encourage better governance systems
            and efficiency in the use of resources; and (2) improve the
            quality and availability of school textbooks. The project
            has three components: (1) The Higher Education Innovation
            Fund encourages the reform of selected institutes; and
            establishes an Innovation Fund focusing on international
            best practice and on the development of social sciences and
            governance and management reform, which offers grants to
            higher education institutions. (2) School Textbook Reform
            provides training and equipment for both the Ministry of
            Economy and regional educational administrators to
            strengthen educational standards and create new textbook
            titles; reviews and renews the federal list of textbooks;
            establishes electronic information and book ordering systems
            for schools, parents, and students; and trains regional and
            local administrators in these systems. (3) The Pilot
            Textbook Procurement Fund assists selected oblasts in
            obtaining textbooks, makes a competitive selection of
            textbooks, and eventually demonopolizes the textbook
            publishing industry; speeding up, developing, and selecting
            more appropriate texts for secondary schools; and the
            creation of a sustainable system of funding for textbook
            supply for the secondary education system.
