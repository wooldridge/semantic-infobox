Description             The multi-donor trust fund seeks to assist the Government of&#13;
Indonesia achieve its medium-term objectives in public financial&#13;
management. The trust fund is administered by the World Bank and&#13;
finances Bank and Recipient activities - particularly those related to&#13;
capacity building, analytical &amp; advisory services, and technical&#13;
assistance. The trust fund is intended to support and complement the&#13;
Bank-financed GFMRAP, the Government's integrated Public&#13;
Financial Management program that locks in major policy and&#13;
institutional reforms across broad areas of Public Financial&#13;
Management.&#13;
I.  INTRODUCTION&#13;
1. The World Bank and several development partners are establishing a Public Financial Management&#13;
Multi Donor Trust Fund to support the Government's medium-term public financial management&#13;
and revenue administration reform  agenda.  Currently, the European Commission and the&#13;
Government of the Netherlands have made preliminary commitments totaling Euro 14.2 million.&#13;
Other donors may also commit additional funding. The trust fund is proposed for six years and is&#13;
intended to support and complement Indonesia's Government Financial Management and Revenue&#13;
Administration Program (GFMRAP), financed by World Bank programmatic investment loans. The&#13;
proposed Public Financial Management Multi Donor Trust Fund would provide complementary and&#13;
flexible support to all stages of GFMRAP by providing quick and key technical assistance in the&#13;
initial pilots and especially the more difficult and risky stages of the reform process. The Public&#13;
Financial Management Multi Donor Trust Fund will consequently pay particular attention to tax and&#13;
customs reforms. In addition to flexibility, the principles of government ownership, policy&#13;
engagement, donor coordination, and participation will underlie the implementation of the Public&#13;
Financial Management Multi Donor Trust Fund.&#13;

II.   STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND GOVERNMENT STRATEGY&#13;
2. The proposed Public Financial Management Multi Donor Trust Fund supports the Government's&#13;
overall goal of accelerating economic growth and sustained poverty alleviation. The logical&#13;
framework assumes that better public financial management facilitates poverty reduction through&#13;
improved revenue mobilization and administration, and more effective and pro-poor expenditure&#13;
allocation. While there have been impressive successes in the macroeconomic front, efforts to&#13;
improve public administration have lagged. Despite some progress, public investment levels are not&#13;
back to pre-crisis levels and, more broadly, the quality of public services remains inadequate. This&#13;
is a reflection of institutional weaknesses, a lack of transparency and accountability, and corruption.&#13;
The fragmented and overlapping structures within the Ministry of Finance pose major constraints.&#13;
leading to inefficiencies, poor resource allocation, and unreliable reporting. These weaknesses&#13;
affect both sides of the fiscal equation: public resource use and revenue generation. They in turn&#13;
pose continuing constraint to the Government's efforts to alleviate poverty.&#13;
3. The Government estimates that overall revenues need to increase by about 0.5 percent of GDP per&#13;
annum to meet development needs and spending needs to be reprioritized. Revenue goals cannot be&#13;
achieved solely through enforcement and litigation; hence an emphasis on improved resource&#13;
mobilization and a reallocation of spending toward education, health, and infrastructure, taking into&#13;
account the roles of regional governments. The significant reduction in fuel subsidies provides&#13;
Indonesia additional discretionary resources to improve public service delivery. However, as history&#13;
demonstrates, the availability of resources does not automatically increase or improve government&#13;
services. Good public financial management is needed to improve the allocative and operational&#13;
efficiency of budgetary resources to support the Government's development priorities.&#13;
4. The core of the Government's strategy for reforming public financial management derives from the&#13;
Economic Policy Package prepared for 2003-04. The Economic Policy Package builds on earlier&#13;
work from the World Bank Country Financial Accountability Assessment and the Government's&#13;
post-IMF "White Paper", outlining a twin strategy to (i) improve the legal and regulatory framework&#13;
to sustain the government's fiscal position and build public confidence in these functional areas; and&#13;
(ii) to invest in efficient and transparent systems to manage these functions and promote&#13;
accountability and integrity. In total, some major reforms have been initiated though their impact&#13;
has yet to be felt.&#13;
5. In 2004, the Ministry of Finance announced that the GFMRAP would act as an umbrella to integrate&#13;
donor technical assistance for public financial management reform. The Government Financial&#13;
Management and Revenue Administration Program (GFMRAP) is a World Bank funded&#13;
programmatic series of Adaptable Program Loans that the Government considers as an operational&#13;
framework for coordinated donor support for technical assistance and related investment in the&#13;
public financial management domain. GFMRAP was originally designed as a three-stage reform&#13;
process, each focusing on a priority area of reform within Public Financial Management'. The&#13;
GFMRAP-I (2004-2008) focuses on public financial management, covering budget preparation and execution,&#13;
treasury payments system modernization, public procurement, and accountability systems. It provides limited technical&#13;
support for broader revenue administration reforms in subsequent phases.&#13;
GFMRAP-II (2007-2012) will concentrate on tax administration, covering improvement in taxpayer services, business&#13;
process simplification and implementation of a new governance framework including a code of conduct for tax officers,&#13;

Canadian International Development Agency&#13;
current or first stage of GFMRAP is financed by a combination of loan, credit, and grant2. The&#13;
newly appointed Minister of Finance is now keen on a combined GFMRAP II-Ill phase, which&#13;
would cover tax and customs modernization, for which a follow-on Bank loan is currently being&#13;
considered 3.&#13;
6. In her attempt to accelerate the reform  agenda, the new   Minister has proposed an additional&#13;
reorganization to be completed by mid-2006. This reorganization will create two new Director&#13;
Generals, one on intergovernmental relations (decentralization) and the other for consolidated debt&#13;
management (foreign and domestic along with contingent liabilities). In addition, there will also be a&#13;
revamped and empowered Fiscal Policy Unit. Comprehensive policy packages focusing on tax and&#13;
customs administration reform and infrastructure investment regulation were announced in February&#13;
2006, and the replacement in April 2006 of the Heads of Tax and Customs Directorate Generals is&#13;
also a sign of the government's commitment to reform in these areas. The time seems therefore ripe&#13;
to accelerate reforms in the tax and custom areas.&#13;
7. Donors working in the areas of budget, taxes and customs have been asked to accelerate assistance&#13;
to allow the ministry to accomplish core reforms by the end of calendar 2008. The government has&#13;
also indicated that reforms are not sustainable without systematically addressing human resource&#13;
constraints and civil service reform. The Bank is exploring various reform scenarios with the&#13;
Government.&#13;
8. The current World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) specifically addresses two major&#13;
challenges: low investment and weak provision of services. The Bank Group's entire efforts, which&#13;
comprise of analytical and advisory services, lending, contributions by the International Finance&#13;
Corporation and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency activities, and donor partnerships&#13;
and coordination, are to complementarily address these issues. Of the tour business platforms&#13;
defined for implementation of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy. the National Lending&#13;
Platform is critical to the public finance management reform and modernization. The proposed&#13;
multi-donor Public Financial Management Trust Fund specifically addresses the challenges&#13;
associated with this platfor-A  "&#13;
a taxpayer "bill of rights", and an investigations unit. It would also continue to support improvements in public financial&#13;
management, and Customs modernization.&#13;
GFMRAP-III (2008-2010) may support Customs modernization, focusing on improving efficiency, accountability,&#13;
transparency and integrity through revenue performance, trade facilitation, business process and information technology&#13;
modernization, and staff development. GFMRAP-II is expected to continue support for public financial management.&#13;
2 Indonesia GFMRAP I (PO85133): see Project Appraisal Document no. 29910-IND, November 24, 2004. The&#13;
commitment was comprised of $55 million from International Bank of Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and&#13;
$5 million from the International Development Agency (IDA). The Japanese Government through the Policy and&#13;
Human Resources Development Fund (PHRD) has provided $5 million in co-financing, while the Indonesian&#13;
Government has contributed $15 million. The Board approved the loan on December 21. 2004 and it became&#13;
effective on October 27, 2005.&#13;
A Bank supervision mission was conducted in June 2006 and a pre-identification was held in November 2006 with a&#13;
view to prepare the loan for Board discussion in FY2008.&#13;

9. The Bank has worked closely with other development partners to develop the Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy and has intensified the partnerships with key development partners in implementing the&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy goals. Both the European Union (EU) through the delegation of the&#13;
European Commission (EC) and the Government of Netherlands through the Royal Netherlands&#13;
Embassy in Jakarta have been close partners of the World Bank Office Jakarta over the past years.&#13;
The intention of all parties is to intensify the cooperation. This program also complements the&#13;
substantial work done by the World Bank through the Netherlands Technical Assistance Trust Fund&#13;
on improving the investment climate.&#13;
III.  THE PROPOSED TRUST FUND&#13;
A. General Overview&#13;
1. The overall objective of the proposed Trust Fund is to support the Government of Indonesia to&#13;
enhance the public sector contribution to the socio-economic development of its population. The&#13;
purpose of the proposed activities is to improve the effectiveness of public finance management in&#13;
Indonesia through the support to the Government Financial Management and Revenue&#13;
Administration Program (GFMRAP). Special emphasis will be put on taxation and customs.&#13;
2. The underlying principles by which the Public Financial Management Multi Donor Trust Fund will&#13;
function include: (i) government ownership; (ii) policy dialogue; (iii) flexibility; (iv) coordination;&#13;
and (iv) participation. These principles are manifest in the governance structure and the overall&#13;
administration of the Public Financial Management Multi Donor Trust Fund.&#13;
3. The Trust Fund builds on existing partnerships between the Bank and bilateral donors through which&#13;
trust funds have been established. It takes into account lessons that the Bank has learned from&#13;
administering other trust funds, particularly in the area of governance. As the administrator of the&#13;
Public Financial Management Multi Donor Trust Fund, the World Bank has overall management&#13;
and financial accountability, as well as an obligation to demonstrate achievement of expected&#13;
results. Given this responsibility, the Bank takes management, program, and financial decisions to&#13;
achieve the objectives of the Public Financial Management Multi Donor Trust Fund.&#13;
B. Governance Structure&#13;
4. The governance of the Public Financial Management Multi Donor Trust Fund is centered on a&#13;
Policy Advisory Committee and a Management Committee.&#13;
5. The Policy Advisory Committee will consist of the Minister of Finance (or designate) who will chair&#13;
the committee, selected Directors General (Echelon 1 levels) of the Ministry of Finance, the Country&#13;
Director of the World Bank, and the head representatives in Indonesia of contributing donors. Other&#13;
major stakeholders involved in the public financial management arena may also join the Policy&#13;
Advisory Committee in an advisory capacity. The views of the business community will also&#13;
regularly be invited to ensure that the activities undertaken in the context of the Public Financial&#13;
Management Multi Donor Trust Fund are relevant to them as well. The Policy Advisory Committee&#13;
provides a platform for policy engagement and donor coordination in the public financial&#13;
management arena. In this regard, the Government's annual Strategy Note is a crucial to the Policy&#13;
Advisory Committee's objectives.&#13;

6. The Indonesian Government, with the help of the Bank, will derive from its broader medium-term&#13;
program, an annual Strategy Note that prioritizes the policy areas and activities for funding by the&#13;
Trust Fund. The Policy Advisory Committee will review and endorse the Strategy Note and provide&#13;
a debate forum to discuss the cooperation objectives of the Bank and of Trust Fund donors. The&#13;
Policy Advisory Committee will provide: (i) strategic guidance to support the public financial&#13;
management reforms and ensuring coherence between donor funded activities and the Strategy&#13;
Note; and (ii) review general achievements of donor support. The Policy Advisory Committee will&#13;
convene on an annual basis.&#13;
7. The Management Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving proposals to be funded&#13;
under the Public Financial Management Multi Donor Trust Fund. Proposals are to be submitted in&#13;
the form of detailed proposals for Components also known as Child Trust Funds. The Management&#13;
Committee will review and discuss results and impact achieved based on periodic reporting, and&#13;
suggest dissemination and visibility actions. The Management Committee will meet on a quarterly&#13;
basis to review proposals unless a more/less frequent schedule is decided upon by its co-chair&#13;
persons.&#13;
8. Governments buy-in is critical to the success of the Public Financial Management Multi Donor Trust&#13;
Fund program. Accordingly, proposals must be endorsed by the Government before presentation to&#13;
the Management Committee for consideration. This applies to Bank-executed as well as Recipient-&#13;
executed proposals. Non-government agencies may submit proposals for financing under the Multi&#13;
Donor Trust Fund. Government is required to endorse such proposals just as is the case for all&#13;
proposed activities. The endorsement should include an endorsement on the execution arrangement&#13;
which will then be reviewed and approved by the Multi Donor Trust Fund's Management&#13;
Committee in compliance with World Bank policies and procedures. Government should execute&#13;
recipient activities while the Bank should execute Bank activities. Under exceptional circumstances,&#13;
Bank execution of recipient activities maybe allowed if the activities are within the limits set by&#13;
Bank policies, Bank execution is requested by Government, is approved by the World Bank&#13;
Regional Vice President and will be covered by a grant agreement to be executed between the World&#13;
Bank and Government.&#13;
9. The Management Committee is co-chaired by the Bank Lead Economist and the Operations&#13;
Manager. Other voting members include the Bank Regional Financial Management Hub Leader and&#13;
two relevant sector co-coordinators or Country Assistance Strategy platform leaders. The GFMRAP&#13;
Task Team Leader will act as overall Task Team Leader of the Public Financial Management Multi&#13;
Donor Trust Fund and will act as secretariat for the Management Committee. The Task Team&#13;
Leader will not have voting rights at the Management Committee. Technical staff of contributing&#13;
donors and the Government may be part of the Management Committee acting in an advisory&#13;
capacity.&#13;
10. Proposed Components should be aligned with the overall objective of facilitating the realization of&#13;
poverty-reduction goals through a modern, efficient, and pro-poor public financial management&#13;
system. A Component could be implemented by the Bank and/or Government agencies.&#13;
11. Proposals for Component financing are to be submitted to the Task Team Leader at least two weeks&#13;
in advance of the quarterly meetings of the Management Committee. The exact date for the meeting&#13;
will be announced by the Task Team Leader on behalf of the Co-Chairs. Proposals are to be&#13;
submitted with a summary sheet by Bank staff. Proposals will be sent by the Task Team Leader to&#13;
Management Committee members for comments. The Management Committee may decide to&#13;

accept or reject proposals, or put a proposal on hold, in case it endorses the proposal, but wants to&#13;
delay implementation for cash management reasons. In the case of hiring of co-terminous staff prior&#13;
consultation with the participating donors in Jakarta is required regarding the Terms of Reference;&#13;
such staff will be hired through competitive process.&#13;
12. Specific selection criteria for financing include the following:&#13;
A. Proposals for funding must be fully aligned with the priorities of the Government's Annual&#13;
Strategy Note and should complement GFMRAP objectives.&#13;
B. A written statement of endorsement of the Component should be given by an authorized&#13;
representative of the relevant Indonesian counterpart organization. A representative of the&#13;
relevant Indonesian counterpart organization will be invited to present the motivation for&#13;
supporting the Component at the Management Committee meeting considering the proposal.&#13;
13. Both criteria apply to Bank-executed as well as recipient-executed proposals.&#13;
14. A semi-annual review of activities with the Task Team Leader, and if so desired by the contributing&#13;
donors, with the Component Task Manager will be held. This review will also be used to discuss&#13;
impact of the activities, and possible adjustments or additions to the Component. A mid-term&#13;
review, by the Management Committee funded by the Component for administration, will be&#13;
conducted to review the overall effectiveness of the program, and the Bank will on a best effort&#13;
basis, implement recommendations regarding the program made in such review. Six months before&#13;
expiry of the Trust Fund, a review will be held to decide on possible closure or extension of the&#13;
Program.&#13;
C. Areas of Intervention and Indicative Projects&#13;
15. The Public Financial Management Multi Donor Trust Fund is intended for a program of activities to&#13;
be executed by both the recipient or Government of Indonesia and the World Bank. It is further&#13;
anticipated in the initial stages of Trust Fund implementation, that there will be much more Bank-&#13;
executed activities (focusing on Analytical and Advisory Activities and Technical Assistance) than&#13;
recipient-executed activities. Government's buy-in is critical to the success of the Public Financial&#13;
Management Multi Donor Trust Fund program; hence, Government endorsement is required for all&#13;
activities.&#13;
16. The Trust Fund will address issues across a broad range of public financial management related&#13;
areas. Table 1 below provides an indicative list of policy and institutional areas of focus, as well as&#13;
potential activities/projects. Table I also provides a provisional allocation of funding per areas of&#13;
focus. However, as indicated, given the relatively long timeframe of the Public Financial&#13;
Management Multi Donor Trust Fund and the fluid nature of the reform environment, flexibility and&#13;
the avoidance of a pre-determined approach to activities is essential.&#13;

18. If, in the Bank's opinion, an amount of the Grant Funds allocated to any of the categories set forth in&#13;
Paragraph 23 above will be insufficient to finance the expenditures under such category, the Bank&#13;

which, in the Bank's opinion, will not be necessary to meet other expenditures; provided, however,&#13;
that the Bank will consult the Donors when proposed reallocations exceed, cumulatively: (i) 25% of&#13;

D. Results Framework&#13;
19. A results framework for the Trust Fund articulates a logical framework and measurable indicators&#13;
(outputs and outcomes) that will closely align with the Government's own results indicators as laid&#13;
out in GFMRAP. Each Component proposal is expected to lay out a results framework that ties into&#13;
that of the Trust Fund. The results framework for both the Trust Fund as a whole and the individual&#13;
Components will include, to the extent possible, baseline data, measurable indicators, and targets to&#13;
be achieved by the end of the Component. The results framework will comprise a main component&#13;
of the regularly scheduled progress reports to the donors. Table 2 includes the list of outcome&#13;
indicators currently in GFMRAP.&#13;
Table 2. GFMRAP Outcome Indicators&#13;
A. National government policy priorities are reflected in a Medium Term Expenditure Framework&#13;
and annual budgets&#13;
B. Reduced leakage in expenditure flows to end-users as measured by Public Expenditure&#13;
Tracking Surveys&#13;
C. Automated integrated system for budget preparation/execution and treasury enables timely&#13;
release of budget execution documents and processing of payments, provides accurate&#13;
financial reporting, minimizes incidence and size of idle cash balances, and reduces corruption&#13;
in payments&#13;
D. Improved Customs revenue performance and time-for-release performance&#13;
E. Demonstrable evidence of improved performance of Tax and Customs collection and greater&#13;
transparency in implementation of tax and Customs regulation, as indicated by increased ratio&#13;
of revenues to GDP, increase in registered tax payers and filers, reduced tax arrears, and&#13;
reduced clearance time in Customs&#13;

Task Manager will be responsible for overseeing implementation, including procurement and&#13;
disbursement, and reporting to the Task Team Leader to ensure that all information needed for&#13;
maintaining accounts is provided on a timely and accurate basis. Reporting by the Task Manager&#13;
will provide input to the semi-annual report on progress made in achieving the Public Financial&#13;
Management Multi Donor Trust Fund's stated objectives.&#13;
22. All Task Managers of projects report to the Task Team Leader on a semi-annual basis according to a&#13;
predetermined schedule. The Task Team Leader will submit progress reports to the donors on a&#13;
semi-annual basis on program implementation, disbursement, procurement activity, and new&#13;
commitments for the program as a whole and for individual sub-projects. Unaudited financial&#13;
statement will be submitted to donors quarterly.&#13;
23. An implementation completion report will be submitted within six months of this Trust Fund's&#13;
closing date. All Components of US$1million and above will be required to submit an&#13;
Implementation Completion Memorandum within six months from closing date.&#13;
24. Contracting and procurement will follow World Bank guidelines and procedures. Furthermore, the&#13;
administration and enforcement of all provisions of any grant agreement entered into between the&#13;
Bank and a third party that is financed by the Public Financial Management Multi Donor Trust Fund&#13;
shall be the responsibility solely of the Bank and shall be carried out in accordance with its&#13;
applicable procedures. The-grant agreement shall further provide that no amount of the grant funds&#13;
may be used for the payment of taxes levied by or in the territory of the Recipient country.&#13;
25. The Bank, in consultation with the appropriate Indonesian authorities, will promote visibility of&#13;
achievements of the trust fund and contributing donors on information materials pertaining to&#13;
project activities financed by the Public Financial Management Multi Donor Trust Fund, at the sites&#13;
of project activities under implementation, and through specific dissemination events, such as press&#13;
conferences and an annual conference. A separate Component will be established for this purpose.&#13;
