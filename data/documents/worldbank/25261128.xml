Water Supply&#13;
and Sanitation&#13;
in Vietnam&#13;
Turning Finance into&#13;
Services for the Future&#13;
&amp;#12;This report is the product of extensive collaboration and information sharing between many government agencies at national&#13;
and provincial level, and development partners in Vietnam. A core team drawn from the Ministry of Construction and Ministry&#13;
of Agriculture and Rural Development has been lead partners with the Water and Sanitation Program in this assessment&#13;
sector. The authors acknowledge their valuable contribution as well as the information sharing and contributions during&#13;
workshops by other sector stakeholders, including development partners.&#13;
&#13;
The Task Team Leader for the Service Delivery Assessment (SDA) in East Asia and the Pacific is Susanna Smets. The fol-&#13;
lowing World Bank staff and consultants have provided valuable contributions to the service delivery assessment process&#13;
and report: Jeremy Colin, U-Prime Rodriguez, Vinh Quang Nguyen, Iain Menzies, Hang Diem Nguyen, Almud Weitz, Sandra&#13;
Giltner, Nguyen Trong Duong and Nguyen Danh Soan. The report was peer reviewed by the following World Bank staff and&#13;
sector colleagues: Parameswaran Iyer, Lead Water and Sanitation Specialist, Lilian Pena Pereira Weiss, Sr. Water and Sani-&#13;
tation Specialist, Sing Cho, Urban Specialist and Lalit Patra, Chief WASH section, UNICEF Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
The SDA was carried out under the guidance of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s WaÂ­  ter and Sanitation Program and local partners. This re-&#13;
gional work, implemented through a country-led process, draws on the experience of water and sanitation SDAs conductÂ­ ed in&#13;
more than 40 countries in Africa, Latin America, and South Asia.&#13;
&#13;
An SDA analysis has three main components: a review of past water and sanitation access, a costing model to asÂ­       sess the ad-&#13;
equacy of future investments, and a scorecard that allows diagnosis of bottlenecks along the service deÂ­   livery pathways. SDAâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector targets for infrastructure&#13;
and hardware but also what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure that fiÂ­   nance is effectively turned into accelerated&#13;
and sustainable water supply and sanitation service delivery.&#13;
&#13;
The Water and Sanitation Program is a multi-donor partnership, part of the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s Water Global Practice, sup-&#13;
porting poor people in obtaining affordable, safe, and sustainable access to water and sanitation services. WSPâ&#128;&#153;s donors&#13;
include Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Nor-&#13;
way, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and the World Bank.&#13;

In the last two decades the Government of Vietnam has made                        Progress in sanitation and hygiene is lagging behind water&#13;
considerable progress in improving water supply and sani-                         supply, and in urban areas the general absence of wastewa-&#13;
tation in both urban and rural areas and rates of access to                       ter treatment and fecal sludge management is a significant&#13;
improved services are now significantly higher than those in                      gap given the population density and the volume of waste-&#13;

Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets have been met,                          a coherent implementation strategy for taking sanitation&#13;

                                                                                  national target program funded with multi-donor support.&#13;
These achievements are impressive. The reliability of the&#13;
data on which JMP figures are based is, however, disputed                         Although decentralization is quite advanced in Vietnam,&#13;
and many stakeholders consider the access rates to be                             there are instances where central control still inhibits the&#13;

ity of official data sources underlie widespread uncertainty                      the financial and human capacity of local service provid-&#13;
over actual service coverage and functionality. A further                         ers are barriers to service improvement and expansion. In&#13;
complication is that the Government of Vietnam has adopt-                         recent years, government has promoted the adoption of a&#13;
ed targets and technical standards which are more ambi-                           commercial orientation in urban service provision, and some&#13;

There are major disparities in water supply access between                        control over utilities and, despite some promising policy&#13;
regions and between big cities, smaller urban centers and                         initiatives, conditions are not yet attractive for large-scale&#13;

&#13;
Coverage: Assessing Past Progress&#13;
&#13;
With a population now in excess of 88 million4, Vietnam is&#13;
the worldâ&#128;&#153;s thirteenth most populous country. It has also&#13;
experienced one of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s highest economic growth&#13;
rates over the past two decades and recently graduated&#13;
from low- to middle-income country status. This growth&#13;
has been accompanied by a dramatic decline in the rate of&#13;
poverty, which fell from 58% in the early 1990s to 14.5%&#13;
by 2008.5 While living standards have improved for a large&#13;
portion of the population, not every group has benefited in&#13;
equal measure and by 2006, an average of 52% of ethnic&#13;
minority group members continued to live in poverty.&#13;
&#13;
Data from the Joint Monitoring Programme6 (JMP) suggest&#13;
that Vietnam has taken great strides in terms of increasing&#13;
access to improved water supply and sanitation (see Figure&#13;
2.1). In the case of urban water supply, the 1990 access rate&#13;
to improved facilities was already high at 88%, and by 2011&#13;
had reached 99%, with 58% having a house connection.&#13;
Nevertheless, there are significant disparities in access and&#13;
service quality between big cities and smaller urban cen-&#13;
ters.7 Regarding sanitation, access to improved facilities in&#13;
urban areas rose from 64% to 93% over the same period,&#13;
with nearâ&#128;&#147;universal use of flush toilets, the majority of them&#13;
connected to a septic tank or pit with the overflow discharg-&#13;
ing into open drains. Less than 10% of urban wastewater                          In rural areas, access to improved water supply rose from&#13;

a functioning wastewater treatment plant, though drainage                        connections. The most common types of improved source&#13;
networks are generally extensive. Nearly all urban centers                       used are boreholes or tube wells, protected wells and rain-&#13;
have combined stormwater/wastewater systems.                                     water collectionâ&#128;&#148;each accounting for roughly one quarter&#13;

Combined with the assumptions on technology mix and             Table 2.2 shows that anticipated annual CAPEX for water&#13;
unit costs, population growth and targets translate to capi-    supply and sanitation were estimated to be US$208 million&#13;
tal expenditure (CAPEX) requirements for water supply of        and US$231 million, respectively. The available information&#13;
US$1.562 billion per year and US$1.142 billion per year         also indicates a strong bias in expenditures in favor of urban&#13;
for sanitation. A large proportion of the investment require-   areas. In the case of sanitation, for example, the anticipated&#13;
ments are for urban areas. For example, CAPEX require-          public CAPEX of US$205 million per year in urban areas&#13;
ments for urban water supply (U$1,042 billion per year) are     is about 95% of the total for the sanitation sector, and for&#13;
almost double the requirement in rural areas (US$520 million    water supply, the urban share is around 70% of the total&#13;
per year). This is explained solely by the higher per capita    water spending.&#13;
costs of facilities in urban areas, such as piped household&#13;
connection and wastewater treatment facilities.                 Anticipated public and household investments for water sup-&#13;

Collecting information on anticipated investments and           by US$1.258 billion per year and US$784 million per year,&#13;
comparing the results to CAPEX requirements allows the          respectively. The absolute deficits in urban areas are also es-&#13;

Anticipated public investments represent the planned ex-        sanitation facilities, the expected upfront household contri-&#13;

anticipated household investments are calculated as a fixed     and piped water services are assumed to be zero (note: as&#13;

The process of collecting and compiling information on          This means that the real deficits in the rural areas are likely&#13;

surrounding the subsectoral data used in the analysis.          and there is no assurance that it will actually materialize.&#13;
Third, unlike anticipated investments of donors, there is       Especially for rural sanitation, where there is only limited&#13;
uncertainty around the anticipated investment level of          hardware subsidy for poor and near-poor households under&#13;

As part of the Service Delivery Assessment process, gov-         cially cost recoveryâ&#128;&#148;and hence sustainabilityâ&#128;&#148;of existing&#13;

    Unit costs for water supply facilities estimated from a project document is about $113 per person (see World Bank, 2010, Project Paper on a Proposed&#13;
 Additional Financing Credit in the Amount of SDR 42 million to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam for the River Delta Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project,&#13;
 March). This was scaled to units comparable with those used in the current analysis using the consumer price index and exchange rate.&#13;

    Feasibility studies conducted for the Vietnam Urban Water Supply Development Project indicate an investment budget of US$135 million and is expected&#13;
 to benefit 0.9 million persons (See Poyry Environment Oy, 2009, Vietnam Urban Water Supply Development Project: Sub-project of Phase 2 Competition&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in Vietnam :
            turning finance into services for the future
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Water and sanitation Service Delivery
            Assessments (SDAs) are taking place in seven countries in
            East Asia and the Pacific region under the guidance of the
            World Banks Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) and local
            partners. This regional work, implemented through a
            country-led process, draws on experience of water and
            sanitation SDAs conducted in more than 40 countries in
            Africa, Latin America and South Asia. The SDA analysis has
            three main components: a review of past water and sanitation
            coverage, a costing model to assess the adequacy of future
            investments, and a scorecard that allows diagnosis of
            bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway. These
            components are not directly linked to each other, but in
            combination they produce a picture of the country WASH
            status and critical issues in the sector. The SDA
            contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and
            future finance is sufficient to meet sector targets for
            infrastructure and hardware, but what specific issues or
            bottle necks need to be addressed to ensure finance is
            effectively turned into accelerated and sustainable water
            supply and sanitation service delivery. Bottlenecks can
            occur throughout the service delivery pathway all the
            institutions, processes and actors that translate sector
            funding into sustainable services. Where the pathway is well
            developed, sector funding should turn into services at the
            estimated unit costs. Where the pathway is not well
            developed, investment requirements may be gross under
            estimates because additional investment may be needed to
            unblock&#157; the bottlenecks in the pathway.
