            This World Bank Annual Report for FY2006
            notes that the past year saw both progress and continued
            challenges in the global fight against poverty and
            inequality. The Report discusses the following topical
            highlights:  Debt relief for the poorest countries;
            targeting development in Africa; addressing governance and
            anticorruption issues globally; improving partnerships with
            the international community; quick responses to potential
            avian flu outbreaks; and disaster relief. There were 112
            IBRD projects totaling $14.1 billion. The top three sectors
            for lending were Law and Justice and Public Administration;
            Transportation; and Energy and Mining. As for IDA
            concessional lending, 167 projects totaled $9.5 billion. The
            top three Sectors were Law and Justice and Public
            Administration; Transportation; and Health and Other Social
            Services. Non-lending Activities comprises 307 technical
            assistance activities; and 601 economic and sector work
            products. There were 16 major evaluations by the Independent
            Evaluation Group reviewing the Bank's performance on a
            range of activities including country assistance, debt
            relief, development effectiveness, middle-income countries,
            post-disaster assistance, and trade. More than 150
            publications were issued, including Global Development
            Finance 2006, Global Monitoring Report 2006, World
            Development Indicators 2006, and World Development Report
            2006: Equity and Development. While country-led poverty
            reduction and national development strategies continued to
            be important mechanisms for defining country priorities and
            aid strategies, several additional issues moved to the
            forefront of the Bank's activities during fiscal 2006.
            These diverse issues included improving governance and
            accountability, implementing a new Multilateral Debt Relief
            Initiative, expanding initiatives undertaken within the 2005
            Africa Action Plan, developing a framework for middle-income
            countries, supporting agriculture in the poorest countries,
            cooperating with other international organizations to combat
            avian flu, searching for new approaches to deal with climate
            change, and strengthening partnerships to put in place a
            monitoring plan for the March 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid
            Effectiveness. The Bank also responded to emergencies,
            including the October 2005 earthquake in northern Pakistan
            and the May 2006 earthquake in Indonesia.
