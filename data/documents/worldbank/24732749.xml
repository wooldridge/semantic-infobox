ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
This Collaboration Arrangement is entered into on October 9, 2014 between:&#13;
(1)   ALDWYCH HOLDINGS LIMITED, herein represented by its Managing Director, headquaril e at&#13;
30 King Street, London, EC2\' 8EH, United Kingdom ("Aldwych"); and&#13;
(2)   THE WORLD BANK GROUP, comprising the INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR&#13;
RECONSTRUCTION AND DIEVELOPMENT ("IBRD") and INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPIV E I\&#13;
ASSOCIATION ("IDA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20433, US!\, ie&#13;
INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION, ("IFC") headquartered at 2121 Pennsylvar E&#13;
Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20433, USA, and the MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT&#13;
GUARANTEE AGENCY, ("MiGA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC :10 33,&#13;
USA (the "World Bank Grou )")&#13;
(each a "Party" and together, the "Parties").&#13;
Preamble&#13;
(A) There is broad international recognition, as confirmed by the G20, the OECD, Inter 12 t, nal&#13;
Organizations (1Os), the G77 and the private sector represented by the B20 that investin in the&#13;
infrastructure of Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is needed, to q: ind&#13;
access to basic services anc raise living standards for all, and to meet global economic - nlth&#13;
targets.&#13;
(B) Meeting this need presents a significant financing challenge. Given constraints on . :i ing&#13;
sources of infrastructure fina ice-particularly in the public sector-a redoubled and cooi:J n, ted&#13;
effort is needed to mobilize p ivate sector finance for EMDE infrastructure.&#13;
(C) There is an absence of robust pipelines of structurally sound and bankable projects an t   is&#13;
understood to be the greates barrier to achieving significantly more infrastructure investm :nt&#13;
(D) Governments, development f nance institutions, donors, and private investors share an in 3e t in&#13;
developing the market for pr vate infrastructure finance in EMDEs: both on the demand s d , in&#13;
the numbers of structurally scund and bankable projects seeking finance, and gradual emir ;1: ice&#13;
of EMDE infrastructure as a recognized asset class; and the supply side, in the range ol Ir ate&#13;
investors that actively partic'pate in financing those projects. Achieving these goals will IIe )efit&#13;
from collective action betwe n this range of entities-to leverage resources and knowl:1 ll( to&#13;
find solutions to complex ifrastructure financing challenges that no single institutio ' ( 'uld&#13;
achieve alone.&#13;
(E) In support of these goals, the Parties propose the establishment of a Global Infrastructure FE ility&#13;
Partnership Program ("GIF") The GIF will be an open global platform aiming at levera i i,: the&#13;
efforts of the wide range of i istitutions currently engaged in supporting EMDE infrastruct.ii e vith&#13;
the participation of private infrastructure investors, coalescing around project pre a' a on,&#13;
structuring, and  risk mitigati )n for individual infrastructure investments. In this regard, I e GIF&#13;
aims to complement existinq and proposed services and initiatives currently supportec :i the&#13;
Parties and other prospective GIF partners. The GIF intends to provide resources to prep, r: /ell-&#13;
structured, infrastructure prcjects, and to serve as an additional mechanism for acces iii; the&#13;
expertise of the Parties and other GIF partners, in combination with guidance from pro ;IE tive&#13;
private sector financiers into Droject structures. The GIF thereby aims to achieve greater I :!e age&#13;
of official resources in the fe ce of substantial EMDE infrastructure needs-in particular 1:)- 1rge&#13;
and complex projects with th a potential to attract significant private capital.&#13;
(F) The Parties are now interested in collaborating in developing the Global Infrastructure I- ility&#13;
Partnership Program, togeth.r with other partners.&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
Accordingly, the Parties have come to the following understanding:&#13;

they are of an indicative nature and will continue to be developed amongst the Parties and v I&#13;
other potential partners until tie GIF is formally established. The final version of these obje :. IN !s&#13;
and principles will be agreed ipon by the GIF Partners and be reflected in the agreement&#13;
establishing the GIF.&#13;
1.2   The Parties intend to work together with any additional participants who may be&#13;
collaborating on the GIF to fu ther enhance their coordination, in particular by developing t I IF,&#13;
with a view to formally establi 3hing the program by December 2014.&#13;
2     Further Collaboration&#13;
2.1   Pursuant to the foreg )ing, the Parties will use reasonable endeavors to continue t'&#13;

Annex 1&#13;
Preliffinary GIF Foundational Principles&#13;
1     Objectives&#13;
1.1   The objective of the IF is to promote private sector investment in infrastructure pl : e ts&#13;
in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) through robust project preparatilI ,&#13;
provision of appropriate risk mitigation instruments, and thereby increasing the commercial zn&#13;
institutional investor engagerr ent in the EMDE infrastructure market. It is focused on&#13;
collaboration in complex publi-private partnerships and projects with potential for commer :Ji&#13;
viability which require project Dreparation resources, policy dialogue and eventual infrastru :t.j&#13;
financing solutions that no single institution could achieve alone.&#13;
1.2   To this end, the GIF z ims to create a global platform to provide financial and coorc ral on&#13;
resources in collaboration wit i the project preparation, advisory, and financing efforts of th * le&#13;
range of donor and development finance institutions currently engaged in supporting EMD&#13;
infrastructure, with the input and ideas of private infrastructure investors. GIF's engagemer tc uld&#13;
stretch from upstream support on project definition, preparation, and investment feasibility&#13;
assessment, through to downstream transaction preparation, financial structuring, and risk&#13;
mitigation/credit enhancement.&#13;
1.3   Over the longer term, by contributing to the stock of high quality and well-structure:1&#13;
infrastructure projects, the GI - can be expected to help in the development of EMDE&#13;
infrastructure as an asset cla!s attractive to a wide range of private investors seeking long tir i&#13;
assets in faster growing econ mies, but which until now have been presented only limited&#13;
infrastructure investment opp )rtunities that meet their risk tolerance and investment profile :&#13;
2     Operating Principles&#13;
2.1   The GIF intends to operate according to the following core principles, to be finalizE d L on&#13;
agreement among GIF partn rs:&#13;

leverage public funds, and attract private sector and/or institutional investors- ; aI&#13;
as through Public -Private Partnership (PPP) modalities-while still meeting&#13;
government's ser /ice delivery objectives.&#13;
The GIF will focus on infrastrL cture investments that have global public good characteristic : ; ich&#13;
as climate friendly-projects that are low emitting or encourage efficiency in the provision cf&#13;
infrastructure services; and tride enabling-projects that facilitate or enhance interconnet t /&#13;
and trade.&#13;
5.2   The scope of suppo t provided to a particular project will be defined flexibly, with I'v !w&#13;
to complementing the resources and support already available from partner entities and ot lor&#13;
funding mechanisms. During he GIF pilot phase, this support may include the following ac -ii 3s,&#13;
corresponding to major project development stages:&#13;
(i) Project definition and enabling environment - sector planning and investment&#13;
prioritization; project definition, including needs analysis and pre-feasibility scr!.r  g;&#13;
and legal, regulatory, or institutional reforms;&#13;
(ii) Project preparation and investment feasibility - feasibility studies, investment&#13;
appraisal, and PFIP structuring;&#13;

6     Operational Policies&#13;
Sound operational policies-iicluding in particular the management of environmental and i;nc 31&#13;
impacts and risks, and transparency in procurement-are critical to the success of infrastr it ti e&#13;
projects in supporting sustainable, inclusive development; as well as for investors in those&#13;
projects to manage financial, reputational and legal risks. In developing the appropriate&#13;
framework for GIF-supported operations, the GIF could draw upon existing arrangements cr&#13;
external implementing entitie: under World Bank Partnership Programs. GIF partners will&#13;
collaborate to establish an arproach to fiduciary, environmental and social safeguards an( it er&#13;
standards and policies, and c evelop, manage and oversee an accreditation process for GI::&#13;
Technical Partners who are Expected to function as implementing entities for GIF activities&#13;
