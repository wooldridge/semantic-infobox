COAL SECTOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MITIGATION PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. THE ORIGIN OF THE PROJECT&#13;
Coal: India's major source of commercial energy&#13;
1.1   INDIAS ENERGY RESOURCES. Considering the size of its economy, India is poorly endowed with&#13;
energy resources. While the country has relatively large coal resources, it has only modest oil and gas&#13;
resources:&#13;
India's coal resources are large enough to meet the projected demand for the next 250 years.&#13;
Coal currently meets two-thirds of India's energy needs. Considering that most of India's&#13;
coal resources can be produced relatively inexpensively (taking environmental and social&#13;
mitigating actions into account) and that India's transport infrastructure (ports, railways and&#13;
roads) would need to be expanded significantly to permit energy imports on a large scale,&#13;
indigenous coal is likely to remain the least-cost option for the bulk of India's energy needs&#13;
for the foreseeable future. The prospects for coal are closely tied to the reforms in the power&#13;
sector, which consumes almost 70% of India's coal output.&#13;
&#149;   Domestic oil production meets about 25% of the country's needs and, unless major new oil&#13;
fields are discovered, existing reserves will last for only about 15 years.&#13;
*   Natural gas plays a relatively minor role in India's energy economy. Current domestic&#13;
production accounts for only 5% of India's commercial energy use and existing reserves will&#13;
supply current consumers for about 20 years. To relieve some of the demand pressures on&#13;
indigenous coal, the Gas Authority of India is considering the import of gas from the Middle&#13;
East.&#13;
*   India's potential for generating hydroelectric power is estimated at 100,000 Megawatts&#13;
(MW); about 30% of this potential has been developed. Opposition from environmental&#13;
groups, the resistance of potentially affected people to resettlement, and disputes about&#13;
riparian rights with neighboring countries have made it increasingly difficult in recent years&#13;
to implement hydroelectric projects.&#13;
*   India also has large resources of lignite. Most of these resources, which are estimated at 16&#13;
billion tons, are located in the south of India; smaller deposits have also been discovered in&#13;
Gujarat and Rajasthan. The Neyveli Lignite Corporation, which is India's largest lignite&#13;
mining company, currently produces 15 million tons of lignite from two mines in Tamil&#13;
Nadu. Because of the relatively low calorific content of lignite, the demand for this fuel is&#13;
restricted to the area around deposits.&#13;
1.2    Until the late 1960s, India met its energy needs predominantly through oil imports. After the steep&#13;
increase in international oil prices during the early 1 970s made indigenously produced coal more eco-&#13;
nomically attractive than imported oil, the Government decided to make coal-based thermal power genera-&#13;
tion the backbone of India's energy economy. To finance the massive investments for the expansion of&#13;
coal production, the Government nationalized most coal mines in the early 1970s. This not only provided&#13;
the industry with access to public finance for these investments, it also extended the Government's control&#13;
over all major management decisions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
1.3   In exercising control over the coal industry, the Govemment was guided by the perception that the&#13;
industry provides a vital service to the rest of the economy, much like a public utility. Decisions were&#13;
driven by a single objective: to meet India's rapidly growing demand for energy. Financial considerations&#13;
played only a minor role.&#13;
The need for reform&#13;
1.4    A foreign exchange and budget crisis in 1991 forced the Govemment to rethink its support to the&#13;
public sector. As an initial step, the Govemment decided to phase out its financial support to several&#13;
public sector enterprises, including Coal India. Faced with dwindling financial support from the Govern-&#13;
ment, Coal India's management decided to put its mines on a commercial footing, phase out loss-making&#13;
operations, eliminate surplus labor and reduce 'receivables' from major coal consumers. Many of these&#13;
steps are politically quite sensitive, in part because their impact would be concentrated in a few major coal&#13;
producing regions (mostly in Southem Bihar and West Bengal); they would affect sensitive Center-State&#13;
relationships (e.g. State Electricity Boards could no longer count on 'automatic' credit from Coal India for&#13;
coal supplies); and steps, such as the closure of mines and retrenchment of coal miners, would require the&#13;
support of labor unions, which would be reluctant to see their membership dwindle.&#13;
Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project&#13;
1.5   In the short term, Coal India's main objective was to remain financially viable while implement-&#13;
ing investments without further support from the Govemment. Coal India and the Bank agreed that the&#13;
most effective way to assist Coal India would be by financing a time-slice of Coal India's investments. In&#13;
line with Coal India's short-termn financial objectives, the Bank's financial support would be limited to&#13;
investments in highly profitable mines that are economically viable, had no major environmental problems&#13;
and required the least number of people to be resettled. (Initially, 35 mines met these conditions. In the&#13;
course of project preparation, Coal India decided to finance urgently needed investments in 10 mines from&#13;
its own resources.) To minimize the time lag between investment and financial results, only existing mines&#13;
were eligible for Bank support. Broad agreement was reached with the Government and Coal India on a&#13;
reform program for the coal industry. (See Annex 2.9, para 25 for a synopsis of the reform program.)&#13;
Under the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project, as it was originally proposed, Coal India would also have&#13;
received IDA financing for remedial and mitigating environmental and social actions to bring the selected&#13;
mines in line with the requirements of Indian laws and regulations and the Bank Group's Operational&#13;
Directives.&#13;
Coal Sector Environmental and Social Mitigation Project&#13;
1.6   In November 1995, agreement was reached with the Govemment and Coal India to package the&#13;
environmental and social components of the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project as a separate project. This&#13;
decision made it possible to assist Coal India, through the implementation of high priority environmental&#13;
and social mitigation programs, to strengthen its capacity to deal more effectively with environmental and&#13;
social issues. As such, the project supports Coal India's objective to make coal production environmentally&#13;
and socially sustainable. The results of various environmental and social studies, the increase in staff with&#13;
social and environmental expertise and the enhancements to Coal India's policies for resettlement and&#13;
rehabilitation, community development and environmental management that were made by Coal India in&#13;
the context of the preparation of this project to bring them in line with the Bank Group's Operational&#13;
Directives will affect all of its 495 mining operations; they will be tested in the 25 mines included under&#13;
this project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.7   LINK TO THE COAL SECTOR REHABILITATION PROJECT. In the course of the preparation of this project,&#13;
reviews of the environmental and social aspects were carried out for the coal mines that are slated to&#13;
receive financial support under the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project. The aim of these reviews was to&#13;
ensure that the coal companies had complied with Indian environmental legislation and rules and the&#13;
conditions contained in enviromnental clearances, as well as the Bank Group's Operational Directives on&#13;
Environmental Assessment (OD4.01), Involuntary Resettlement (OD4.30) and Indigenous Peoples&#13;
(OD4.20). Where necessary, Environmental Action Plans, Rehabilitation Action Plans and Indigenous&#13;
Peoples Developmenit Plans were prepared to ensure full compliance with the above requirements. The&#13;
proposed project would provide Coal India with funds to implement these action plans.&#13;
Link to country assistance strategy&#13;
1.8    The project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the Board on June 20,&#13;
1995. The strategy emphasizes continued Bank/IDA support for India on:&#13;
*   the reform of policies in key sectors of its economy;&#13;
*   the rationalization of its energy policy, in particular the pricing policies for various energy&#13;
resources;&#13;
*   the reform of public sector enterprises;&#13;
*   the enhancement of the social and environiental sustainability of the Government's invest-&#13;
ment program;&#13;
*   improving environmental protection, strengthening the capacity of the various entities to deal&#13;
more effectively with environmental issues and enforcing environmental legislation in India;&#13;
*   increasing the role of beneficiaries and NGOs in resettlement and rehabilitation of project-&#13;
affected persons, and&#13;
*   broad-based implementation of consultation and participation so as to enable affected&#13;
people, in particular women, to participate more fully in the development process.&#13;
1.9    This project gave the Association an opportunity to assist Coal India in the drafting of its policies&#13;
on resettlement and rehabilitation, community development and environmental management. As they&#13;
stand now, these policies reflect the requirements of the Bank Group's Operational Directives on Environ-&#13;
mental Assessments (0D4.01), Involuntary Resettlement (OD4.30) and Indigenous Peoples (OD4.20).&#13;
Perhaps the most significant contribution that arose out of the Association's involvement with this project&#13;
is the extensive use of consultative processes with project-affected people in the preparation of the various&#13;
action plans.&#13;
II. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES&#13;
2.1    Coal production, whether it takes place in opencast or underground mines, requires access to land.&#13;
Unlike other industries, the coal industry has little choice in the location of its activities. The development&#13;
of coal mines depends on the availability of commercial reserves. In recent years, the social and environ-&#13;
mental costs of developing coal reserves have increased steeply, particularly in the densely populated&#13;
areas of India's eastern States. Coal India finds it more and more difficult to acquire land for the expansion&#13;
of its operations.&#13;
2.2    This section briefly describes the main effects of coal mining operations on the environment and&#13;
the lives of the people in coal mining areas; the policies and enhancements (Coal India's Corporate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
Environmental Policy, Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy and the Community Development Policy&#13;
[IPDP]) Coal India has adopted to mitigate the adverse effects of its operations and to make them environ-&#13;
mentally and socially sustainable; and the application of these policies (through the implementation of&#13;
Environmental Action Plans, Rehabilitation Action Plans and Indigenous Peoples Development Plans) in&#13;
the 25 mines.&#13;
Environmental issues&#13;
2.3    Box 2.1 provides an overview of the main adverse environmental effects of coal mining, the&#13;
underlying causes and Coal India's policy on how to mitigate them. A more detailed description of the&#13;
environmental effects of coal mining, the Indian environmental legislation and institutional arrangements&#13;
is contained in the Environmental Impact Assessment of the Indian Coal Sector (May 1995).&#13;
2.4   ENHANCING COAL INDIA'S CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. Coal India recognizes&#13;
that an effective corporate strategy on environmental management would need to embody a strengthening&#13;
of Coal India's capacity to (a) design coal mining operations in a way that minimizes adverse impacts on&#13;
the environment and (b) ensure that these operations are implemented and operated in line with prevailing&#13;
environmental standards, regulations and (mine-specific) conditions contained in approval letters issued&#13;
by the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF). This will require additional staff (with appropriate&#13;
skills) at the Coal Mine Planning and Design Institute Ltd. (CMPDI) and its regional offices, which&#13;
provide design and planning support to subsidiary coal companies. It will also require an increase in the&#13;
number of staff with environmental skills at the various management levels of the subsidiary coal compa-&#13;
nies. An overview of the staffing requirements is provided in Annex 2.1, Box 2.1.2. Coal India has&#13;
agreed to review with the Association, by June 30, 1997, a program, satisfactory to the Association, to&#13;
strengthen its environmental management capacity and to implement the program over thefollowing&#13;
eighteen months.&#13;
Environmental Action Plans (EAPs)&#13;
2.5    Legislation requiring the preparation of Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) as a precondi-&#13;
tion for obtaining environmental clearances came into force in India in 1986. For the 17 mines included&#13;
under the proposed Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project that were approved after 1986, Coal India has&#13;
submitted the EMPs and environmental clearances issued by MoEF (approval letters) to the Association.&#13;
For the remaining eight projects, which were approved before 1986, Coal India has voluntarily prepared&#13;
EMPs. The approval letters issued by MoEF stipulate the conditions under which mining operations may&#13;
be conducted. In addition, the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) issue consent letters regarding&#13;
emissions into the air and water. These consent letters are valid between one and three years, after which&#13;
Coal India has to apply for renewal. Coal India has confirmed that it will continue to seek extension of&#13;
environmental clearancesfrom appropriate authoritiesfor each of the selected 25 mines before expira-&#13;
tion of the current clearance and to take all required action to obtain the approvals andfurnish them to&#13;
the Association.&#13;
2.6   COMPLIANCE WITH OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVES. The EMPs that have been prepared for coal projects&#13;
cover most of the subjects required by OD 4.01. (As far as coal mining is concerned, India's environmental&#13;
standards are broadly in line with similar standards in other major coal producing countries.) Subjects not&#13;
dealt with in the EMPs, such as environmental policy, environmental law, institutional arrangements,&#13;
occupational health and safety and public consultation, have been addressed in the Environmental Impact&#13;
Assessment of the Indian Coal Sector.&#13;

2.7   In line with its Corporate Environmental Policy (Annex 2.2), in particular the commitment to self-&#13;
police compliance with environmental laws and regulations, Coal India has reviewed the status of environ-&#13;
mental compliance of the selected 25 mines and prepared a program of actions (Environmental Action&#13;
Plans [EAPs]), which would bring each mine into full compliance with Indian environmental legislation&#13;
and standards as well as with OD 4.01. In preparing these plans, Coal India has made an effort to consult&#13;
with all project-affected people, their representatives and local NGOs. The EAPs contain a time-bound&#13;
action program for environmental mitigation and performance benchmarks to facilitate the monitoring of&#13;
their implementation; they have been included as an annex to the Environmental Impact Assessment of the&#13;
Indian Coal Sector.&#13;
2.8    MINE EMERGENCY PLANS. Mine emergency plans have been prepared as required by the Coal Mine&#13;
Regulations issued in 1957. Coal India has agreed to submit these plans to a team of expertsfor review&#13;
by December 31, 1996 and, if required, update these plans in line with their recommendations. Techni-&#13;
cal assistance for this review will be provided under this project.&#13;
2.9    OVERBURDEN DUMP STABILITY. During the environmental review questions were raised with regard&#13;
to the stability of existing overburden dumps, in particular the erosion of slopes during the monsoon and&#13;
the difficulty of vegetating steep slopes. Although these are valid environmental concerns, they do not&#13;
seem to pose a significant danger to people or structures near the overburden dumps. Coal India informed&#13;
the Association that not a single overburden dump has collapsed since it started operations. The overbur-&#13;
den dumps at the selected mines have a height of about 70-80 meters and have slopes at the angle of&#13;
repose of the overburden material (sandstone) with maximum values slightly greater than 35 degrees. At&#13;
the request of the Association, Coal India has contracted the Indian School of Mines to carry out safety&#13;
engineering studies for the approximately 150 overburden dumps at the selected 25 mines. These studies&#13;
are expected to be completed by August 15, 1996. Coal India has agreed to appoint a panel of experts by&#13;
August 15, 1996 that would review thefindings of the safety engineering studies. Coal India has further&#13;
agreed to implement the recommendations of this panel. Disbursementsfor remedial action, such as the&#13;
regrading of overburden dumps, would need to be based on respective recommendations of the safety&#13;
engineering studies and the panel's endorsement of these recommendations. In cases where Coal India&#13;
would like to carry out remedial actions on these overburden dumps for other than safety reasons, dis-&#13;
bursements would require the Association's approval.&#13;
Social issues&#13;
2.10   As indicated in para 2.1 above, the location of coal mine is determined by the discovery of com-&#13;
mercial coal reserves. In India, many of these reserves have been located in remote areas. Several studies&#13;
have shown that the expansion of coal mining into remote areas has a profound impact on people and&#13;
communities in these areas. Originally, most of these communities had only limited contact with 'the&#13;
modem world.' The livelihood of people was mainly based on subsistence agriculture, hunting and&#13;
foraging for forest products. The opening of a coal mine brought:&#13;
*   a loss of homestead and land for grazing and forest use;&#13;
*   an influx of 'outsiders' (officers and skilled laborers that worked in the coal mine, contrac-&#13;
tors, small businessmen, government officials);&#13;
*   employment opportunities (to the extent that the coal company or other businesses needed&#13;
land, they usually offered employment in addition to the purchase price for the land);&#13;
*   education and health care (usually provided for those fortunate enough to find employment&#13;
with the coal company);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
*   roads (construction of roads made it easier to reach and trade with other communities); and&#13;
*   electricity and water supply (coal companies provided these basic amenities primarily to&#13;
their colonies and a few villages next to their mines).&#13;
These factors profoundly changed traditional lifestyles and reduced the possibilities of employment based&#13;
on traditional skills. Above all these changes affected tribals and women. They were least likely to find&#13;
employment in one of the industries that had moved into the area. For a more detailed description of these&#13;
effects see Annex 2.3 and the studies listed in Annex 5.1.&#13;
2.11   The present day population living around the coal mines has been affected by the mining opera-&#13;
tions in different ways and to varying degrees. Those losing land and other productive assets on which&#13;
their livelihoods depended, such as land owners, tenants, agricultural laborers, etc., may experience a&#13;
decline in their living standard. A total of 16,310 persons will be affected by land acquisition during the&#13;
implementation of the project. Out of these 9,260 persons are above 18 years of age, and would be reha-&#13;
bilitated under the project.&#13;
2.12   Those living in communities surrounding the mines may be experiencing a break-up of social ties,&#13;
increased social differentiations and stratification, not by losing assets but by exposure to the changes and&#13;
differential access to employment. The communities are in need of interventions that will address the&#13;
needs of the poor and other vulnerable groups in order to maintain and improve the quality of life in the&#13;
communities. The population living in communities around the mines, and influenced by the mine opera-&#13;
tions, numbers 185,811 persons in 189 habitations.&#13;
Indigenous peLples&#13;
2.13   In all the mining areas the local population consists of a mix of scheduled tribes (from 2%-71%),&#13;
scheduled caste and caste people living in 'mixed villages.' Of the population around the mines about 30%&#13;
are scheduled tribes. About 25% of the project-affected people (3,999 persons) are classified as scheduled&#13;
tribes. With the exception of one mine (Jhingurdah), the tribal project-affected population lives in 'mixed'&#13;
villages together with non-tribals. All the tribals speak Hindi, except in Orissa, where they speak Oriya,&#13;
the local language.&#13;
2.14   Most of the tribals in coal mining areas are now integrated into Indian rural society and are&#13;
engaged in agriculture on fixed plots (as opposed to slash and bum cultivation) or crafts related to agricul-&#13;
ture (blacksmith, carpentry, etc.). All of them have been in contact with mining operations for the past 15-&#13;
30 years. In places like Madhya Pradesh, tribal peoples constitute the majority of the local work force in&#13;
coal mines and have done so for more than 20 years. To safeguard the concerns of the tribal communities&#13;
and mitigate the impact of the proposed project on those communities in the areas affected by the project,&#13;
Coal India has prepared Indigenous Peoples Development Plans.&#13;
Mitigating measures&#13;
2.15   Coal India is concerned about the growing difficulties in acquiring land for the expansion of its&#13;
operations. In responding to this situation, Coal India has strengthened its management of environmental&#13;
issues, improved its policy for resettlement and rehabilitation of people affected by its projects and&#13;
adopted a community development policy that would ensure that communities in the vicinity of coal&#13;
mines benefit more directly from these developments. To implement these policies, Coal India has hired&#13;
NGOs or specialized local organizations to prepare (a) Rehabilitation Action Plans for all mines in which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
the investments under the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project would affect the livelihood of people and (b)&#13;
Indigenous Peoples Development Plans for all mines where these investments would affect the quality of&#13;
life of existing communities.&#13;
Resettlement and rehabilitation policy&#13;
2.16    Box 2.2 provides a synopsis of Coal India's current policy for resettlement and rehabilitation. The&#13;
policy, which is reproduced in Annex 2.4, was approved by Coal India's Board on April 4, 1994. It&#13;
represents the latest stage in a development brought about by the increased challenges confronting the coal&#13;
companies when acquiring land. The development is characterized by several important changes:&#13;
*    from recognizing only the loss of land in the compensation process to including the loss of&#13;
all economic assets;&#13;
*    expansion of the concept of project-affected people to include not only land owners but&#13;
anybody whose livelihood would be affected, in particular the landless;&#13;
*    from considering land-owning families as the unit of entitlement to considering every adult&#13;
individual as the unit of entitlement;&#13;

Rehabilitation Action Plans&#13;
2.17   Coal India has, with the help of NGOs and specialized local organizations, prepared Rehabilitation&#13;
Action Plans for the 14 mines in which people would be affected by the investments under the Coal Sector&#13;
Rehabilitation Project. Socio-economic baseline surveys found that 16,310 people would be affected by&#13;
these investments. Of these, 9,260 persons would be entitled to rehabilitation assistance; Coal India and&#13;
contractors would be expected to provide employment for 1,711 persons (18%) and 7,549 persons (82%)&#13;
would be entitled to assistance for self-employment. 10,445 persons would have to be resettled. The Plans&#13;
were reviewed by the Association during appraisal and found to represent a satisfactory basis on which&#13;
Coal India could proceed with the resettlement and rehabilitation of project-affected persons. A summary&#13;
of the Rehabilitation Action Plans is provided in Annex 3.1.&#13;
Coal India 's policy for community development&#13;
2.18   Coal India maintains a close relationship with the communities surrounding its coal mines. This&#13;
relationship starts well before a coal mine is developed. The acquisition of land and homesteads and the&#13;
provision of employment in the coal mine require that Coal India explains to the people living in these&#13;
communities its plans about the opening of a mine. The process of land acquisition brings the local&#13;
authorities, usually the District Magistrate, into the picture. Particularly in remote areas, mine managers&#13;
are often viewed by the people living in the surrounding communities as the representative of Government&#13;
authority and people bring requests for assistance to him. Coal India has a fairly extensive program&#13;
through which it assists communities in the areas around its mines. However, the program is not well&#13;
articulated. While mine managers will usually readily agree to repair or compensate for damages that can&#13;
be attributed directly to mining operations, such as cracks in houses due to blasting or subsidence, the&#13;
response to requests that have no direct link to mining operations is largely at the discretion of the mine&#13;
manager.&#13;
2.19   While most mine managers make sincere efforts to maintain good relationships with the commu-&#13;
nities in their leasehold area, surveys carried out by Coal India and others show that most people are quite&#13;
dissatisfied with living conditions in coal mine areas. Even people who have found employment in the&#13;
mine frequently voice complaints. Several factors contribute to the strains between Coal India's operations&#13;
and the surrounding communities. Three factors stand out:&#13;
*   Most people resent the changes the development of a coal mine has brought with it, the loss&#13;
of the traditional way of life, the influx of outsiders, the noise and pollution of mining&#13;
operations, etc.&#13;
*   More important are the tensions that develop as a result of the large difference between the&#13;
earnings of coal miners and what people could earn in other jobs. (Coal miners earn about&#13;
eight to ten times the minimum wage and their employment is secure.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
In addition, State Governments often feel that the welfare of these communities, in particular&#13;
the provision of services such as health care and basic education, is the responsibility of Coal&#13;
India. Coal India has been reluctant to take on these responsibilities. Coal India maintains&#13;
that it makes a significant contribution to the revenues of the States in which it operates&#13;
through its payments of royalties and cesses and that providing services, such as health care&#13;
and basic education, to all communities surrounding its 495 mines would place an unaccept-&#13;
able financial and administrative burden on the company.&#13;
2.20   In the context of this project, Coal India has cast its various efforts at providing assistance to the&#13;
communities in coal mining areas into a coherent policy statement on community development. (The&#13;
original text is reproduced in Annex 2.5.) The aim of this effort is to guide mine managers in their interac-&#13;
tions with community leaders and to let the communities know in what ways Coal India is prepared to&#13;
assist them. The fact that Coal India issued such a policy underscores the company's commitment to the&#13;
development and welfare of these communities.&#13;
2.21   The objective of the community development policy is to assist local communities in mining areas&#13;
to create, revive and maintain relevant and functioning community assets, institutions and services that can&#13;
improve their choices and living standards and maintain and develop traditional ways of living and the&#13;
social ties of the communities. The benefits of these development activities are open to all people living in&#13;
the mine areas, but will be especially aimed at tribal communities, women and youths. In all-tribal villages&#13;
the target group will be the community as a whole. In the case of mixed villages, the policy adopts a&#13;
poverty focus that will benefit all weaker communities. The implementation of this policy will be carried&#13;
out through groups in the communities. No individual entitlements are envisaged. However, individuals&#13;
from the communities will benefit from the program and, as organizers of development activities, they will&#13;
play a critical role in the successful implementation of this policy.&#13;
Indigenous Peoples Development Plans&#13;
2.22   Based on the community development policy, Coal India, with the help of NGOs and specialized&#13;
local organizations, prepared Indigenous Peoples Development Plans for 24 of the 25 mines slated for&#13;
assistance under the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project. (In one mine, Ananta, no people are living within&#13;
one kilometer of the leasehold of the mine.) Socio-economic baseline surveys were prepared and participa-&#13;
tory planning methods were used to identify the critical needs of the communities. Special efforts were&#13;
made to ensure that the needs of tribals, other vunerable groups and the poor were addressed. The Plans&#13;
were reviewed by the Association during appraisal and found to represent a satisfactory basis on which&#13;
Coal India could proceed with the community development efforts in surrounding communities. A sum-&#13;
mary of the Indigenous Peoples Development Plans is provided in Annex 3.1.&#13;
2.23   Implementation of this policy in the communities surrounding the 25 selected mines would be a&#13;
pilot effort. It would allow Coal India to gain experience, in particular in the use of NGOs, with the&#13;
implementation of this policy. Coal India would be expected to apply the lessons learned from this pilot&#13;
effort in other communities. Coal India has agreed to review with the Association, by December 31,&#13;
1997, the lessons learnedfrom the implementation of the Rehabilitation Action Plans and the Indig-&#13;
enous Peoples Development Plans in the selected 25 mines.&#13;
Consultations and dissemination&#13;
2.24   Coal India has a tradition of interacting closely with the people living in its mining areas. This&#13;
process starts when Coal India takes a decision to develop a mine and starts the process of land acquisition&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
and the hiring of local labor. Throughout the development of the mine and later on, people employed in&#13;
the mines or living in settlements surrounding mines can and do visit mine managers with requests or to&#13;
convey concerns. Coal India has issued an instruction to all mine managers of the selected 25 projects to&#13;
"issue a ... notice in the local newspaper, preferably in local language" noting a time when "anyone of the&#13;
interested project-affected people or local NGOs can meet an officer assigned for this purpose." In its&#13;
instruction, Coal India recommends a monthly meeting on a fixed date.&#13;
2.25   Consultations with project-affected people took place during the preparation of the social and&#13;
environmental action plans. For the preparation of these plans, Coal India hired NGOs with staff that&#13;
spoke the local dialects of the affected people.&#13;
For the preparation of the Rehabilitation Action Plans:&#13;
*   Interviewers visited the household of every project-affected family to prepare the baseline&#13;
socioeconomic surveys. This provided an opportunity to discuss with project-affected people&#13;
how the proposed project would affect their lives and the various options for rehabilitation.&#13;
During the course of these interviews, project-affected people were asked, on the basis of a&#13;
detailed questionnaire, about their perceptions regarding land acquisition, compensation, the&#13;
benefits of the project displacing them and the relocation site and host community.&#13;
*   In addition, most interviewers organized focus group sessions for various groups in Wle&#13;
villages, such as women, the landless and tribals. The main purpose of these focus groups&#13;
was to ensure a broad-based participation of affected people in the resettlement and rehabili-&#13;
tation process.&#13;
In parallel, Coal India conducted a number of workshops on opportunities for self-employ-&#13;
ment to which it invited representatives of project-affected people, NGOs and rehabilitation&#13;
experts. To ensure a wide participation of affected persons, Coal India paid the costs of&#13;
travel and subsistence.&#13;
For the preparation of the Environmental Action Plans:&#13;
*   At each of the mines included under the project, mine managers held meetings with project-&#13;
affected people in which they explained the program of mitigating actions that would be&#13;
undertaken in the course of implementation of Environmental Action Plans.&#13;
For the preparation of the Indigenous Peoples Development Plans:&#13;
-   The most extensive effort of consultation was undertaken during the preparation of these&#13;
plans. Coal India hired NGOs to visit all the villages and settlements in the areas surrounding&#13;
the selected coal mines. While the consultations focused primarily on ways to improve life in&#13;
these communities, it provided interviewers with an opportunity to again convey the purpose&#13;
of the project and to seek opinions on how the local communities perceived its effect on their&#13;
lives.&#13;
2.26   To ensure that this consultative process is indeed effective, Coal India has translated its revised&#13;
policy for resettlement and rehabilitation into the local languages of affected people; statements announc-&#13;
ing this policy and the opening of public information centers at the headquarters of Coal India and its&#13;
subsidiary coal companies have been issued in local newspapers. Coal India has made all information,&#13;
such as Environmental Management Plans, Rehabilitation Action Plans and Indigenous Peoples Develop-&#13;
ment Plans, available to the public in these information centers.&#13;
Environmental and Social Review Panel&#13;
2.27   The project incorporates many novel approaches to the rehabilitation of project-affected people,&#13;
tribal issues and community development. Coal India agrees with the objectives of OD 4.01, 4.20 and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
4.30. Meeting these objectives in the context of this project will require some experimentation. To ensure&#13;
that the objectives of the Operational Directives will be achieved, Coal India has agreed to appoint a&#13;
panel of social and environmental experts, by October 31, 1996, that will monitor the implementation of&#13;
the various action plans. The panel will recommend changes in case it finds that the proposed actions&#13;
under the various plans no longer meet the objectives of the Operational Directives.&#13;
Poverty category&#13;
2.28   One of the project's main objectives is to extend social mitigating actions to communities sur-&#13;
rounding the selected 25 coal mines and to improve the access to schools, health care, water supply and&#13;
other community facilities, in particular to tribal populations and women. Most of the people living in&#13;
these communities are poor. The project contains specific strategies for ensuring access to these facilities&#13;
to these two groups. The implementation of Indigenous Peoples Development Plans in almost 200 com-&#13;
munities would improve the lives of about 186,000 people, most of them poor. In preparing the Indigenous&#13;
Peoples Development Plans, the consultants organized special focus groups with tribals and women to&#13;
provide them with an opportunity to make their needs known.&#13;
Coal India Ltd.&#13;
2.29   The proceeds of the proposed credit would be onlent to Coal India Ltd. (Coal India) and five of its&#13;
subsidiary companies, Northem Coalfields Ltd. (NCL), South Eastem Coalfields Ltd. (SECL), Mahandi&#13;
Coalfields Ltd. (MCL), Central Coalfields Ltd. (CCL) and Westem Coalfields Ltd. (WCL).&#13;
2.30   The company was established in 1975, a few years after the industry had been nationalized. It is a&#13;
private limited company, owned by the Government, and is structured as a holding company with eight&#13;
subsidiaries: Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. (BCCL), South Eastem Coalfields Ltd., Westem Coalfields Ltd.,&#13;
Northem Coalfields Ltd., Eastem Coalfields Ltd. (ECL), Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. and the Central Mine&#13;
Planning and Design Institute Ltd. (CMPDI). All of these except CMPDI are production companies. The&#13;
coal mines in Assam and neighboring areas are controlled directly by Coal India. Coal India currently&#13;
produces about 225 million tons of coal a year and is, in terms of output and employment, the world's&#13;
largest coal company. It has total assets of US$4.8 billion, an equity of US$1.8 billion, and has achieved&#13;
modest profits since 1989. It closed the year 1994/95 with a profit of US$120 million.&#13;
2.31   EXTERNAL AUDITNG. Coal India's accounts are audited annually by the Comptroller and Auditor&#13;
General of India. The audit is normally completed by November, after which the accounts must be submit-&#13;
ted to Parliament for approval. Coal India's intemal auditors carry out a continuous audit during the year,&#13;
while the Corporate Management Group undertakes management audits on a regular basis. The audit&#13;
arrangements are satisfactory. The Government has agreed to submit to the Association the audit report&#13;
of the Special Account and the Statement of Expenses, if any, within nine months of the end of the&#13;
fiscal year. Coal India has agreed to submit to the Association its audited financial statements (income&#13;
statements, fundsflow statement and balance sheet) within nine months of the end of the fiscal year.&#13;

III. THE PROJECT AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Project objectives and design&#13;
3.1    The proposed project would assist Coal India in making coal production more environmentally&#13;
and socially sustainable. This objective would be achieved by&#13;
*   enhancing Coal India's capacity to deal more effectively with environmental and social&#13;
issues;&#13;
e   implementing appropriate policies for environmental mitigation and resettlement and reha-&#13;
bilitation of people affected by coal projects and providing support to communities, in&#13;
particular tribals, living in coal mining areas; and&#13;
*   testing the effectiveness of these policies in the 25 coal mines that have been slated to&#13;
receive financial support under the proposed Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project.&#13;
Project description&#13;
3.2    The proposed project would consist of&#13;
X   technical assistance to enhance Coal India's capacity to deal more effectively with the&#13;
environmental and social issues of coal mining operations (Capacity building component);&#13;
*   the implementation of Environmental Action Plans, Rehabilitation Action Plans and Indig-&#13;
enous Peoples Development Plans for the 25 mines slated to receive financial assistance&#13;
under the proposed Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project (Investment component); and&#13;
*   a review and, if required, implementation of a program of remedial action of the resettlement&#13;
and rehabilitation measures taken by Coal India in implementing projects that have received&#13;
Bank Group support in the past (Social remedial action component).&#13;
3.3   CAPACITY BUILDING COMPONENT. This component (US$7.3 million equivalent or 8.7% of the total&#13;
project cost) would provide funding for studies and training aimed at strengthening Coal India's capacity&#13;
at corporate headquarters, subsidiary headquarters, area, and mine levels to deal effectively with environ-&#13;
mental and social issues.&#13;
3.4   INVESTMENT COMPONENT. The bulk of the financing (US$76.4 million equivalent or 90.9% of the&#13;
total project cost) under the proposed project funds would be used for the implementation of Environmen-&#13;
tal Action Plans, Rehabilitation Action Plans and Indigenous Peoples Development Plans for 25 sub-&#13;
projects which have been identified to receive financial support under the Coal Sector Rehabilitation&#13;
Project. For a description of the investments for the selected 25 mines see Annex 3. 1.&#13;
3.5   SOCIAL REMEDIAL ACTION COMPONENT. This component (US$0.3 million equivalent or 0.4% of the&#13;
total project cost) would provide funds for the preparation and implementation of social remedial action&#13;
programs for the four coal mine projects which have received Bank support in the past (Dudhichua Coal&#13;
Project, which provided financial assistance for the development of the Dudhichua opencast mine, the&#13;
Jharia Coking Coal Project, which provided financial assistance for the development of the Jharia Block II&#13;
opencast mine and the Pootkee-Bulliary underground mine and the Coal Mining Coal Quality Improve-&#13;
ment Project, which provided financial assistance for the expansion of the Gevra opencast mine and the&#13;
development of the Sonepur-Bazari opencast mine.) The Bank's support to the development of the&#13;
Pootkee-Bulliary mine was canceled, and resettlement under the Sonepur-Bazari mine has yet to com-&#13;
mence. (Eastern Coalfields Ltd. has prepared a Resettlement Action Plan for this mine, which has been&#13;
reviewed by the Bank and found to be satisfactory.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
3.6    Land acquisition for the three remaining opencast projects led to the resettlement of about 18,700&#13;
persons. Resettlement of project-affected persons under the Dudhichua and Gevra opencast projects has&#13;
been completed; while the resettlement sites for the Jharia coking coal project have been constructed, a&#13;
number of people refuse to leave their original homesteads until they have received employment with Coal&#13;
India. In line with the Bank's efforts to ensure that the incomes of project affected persons have been&#13;
restored under projects that have received financial support from the Bank in the past, Coal India has&#13;
agreed (a) to carry out an audit of its resettlement and rehabilitation efforts at the Dudhichua, Jharia&#13;
and Gevra opencast mines, (b) to identify project-affected persons whose incomes are below the poverty&#13;
line established by the Government, (c) to provide the Association, by June 30, 1997, with an action&#13;
program to raise the incomes ofpersons below the poverty line to a level above this line and (d) to&#13;
implement this program.&#13;
Lessons learned from previous Bank operations&#13;
3.7    The Bank has made three loans to the Indian coal industry: in 1984, a loan of US$ 151 million for&#13;
the development of the Dudhichua coal mine in Singrauli (Loan 2393-IN); in 1985, a loan of US$248&#13;
million for the development of an opencast mine (Block II) and an underground mine (Pootkee-Bulliary)&#13;
in the Jharia coalfield (Loan 2498-IN); and in 1987, a loan of US$340 million for the expansion of an&#13;
opencast mine (Gevra) in the Korba coalfield, the construction of an opencast mine (Sonepur-Bazari) in&#13;
West Bengal and imports of coking coal (Loan 2796-IN). In 1992, the Board approved a credit of US$12&#13;
million for a technical assistance project to deal with mine fires in the Jharia coalfield (Credit 2450-IN).&#13;
Loan 2498-IN for the Jharia Coking Coal project was closed on December 31, 1992, Loan 2393-IN for the&#13;
Dudhichua Coal project on March 31, 1993 and Loan 2796-IN for the Coal Mining Coal Quality Improve-&#13;
ment Project on September 30, 1995. Implementation Completion Reports have been prepared for Loan&#13;
2393-IN and Loan 2498-IN. Loan 2393-IN has been audited by OED.&#13;
3.8   Implementation of the projects supported by these loans has been uneven. While the construction&#13;
of the Dudhichua coal mine and the expansion of the Gevra coal mine proceeded without any major&#13;
problems and ahead of schedule, the opencast mine in the Jharia coalfield and Sonepur-Bazari were&#13;
plagued by land acquisition problems. This delayed not only their implementation and disbursements of&#13;
the loans, it also reduced the commercial viability of these projects. One component, the Pootkee-Bulliary&#13;
underground mine was canceled after it was discovered that the coal reserves at this location would not&#13;
support the original mine design, and the subsidiary coal company was unable to come up with another&#13;
commercially viable proposal.&#13;
3.9    Several lessons can be drawn from these projects:&#13;
*   Technical assistance greatly enhances the chances that a project is implemented properly and&#13;
on time. The Dudhichua mine is rightly regarded as one of the most successful mines in the&#13;
Singrauli coalfield. This is largely due to the fact that the construction of the mine had,&#13;
during its initial years, considerable assistance and guidance from an intemational mining&#13;
consultant.&#13;
*   Project implementation units need to be strengthened, in particular with regard to skills&#13;
required for the implementation of environmental and social action programs.&#13;
*   Project-affected people must be informed about a project as soon as it is contemplated. Staff&#13;
trained in community relations need to keep the affected people fully informed about a&#13;
project and ensure full participation of all socio-economic strata of affected communities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
*   If resettlement is involved, the process of consultation with regard to rehabilitation options&#13;
and the choice of resettlement sites needs to be substantially completed before start-up of a&#13;
project.&#13;
*   Environmental management needs to be built into the design of the coal mine (e.g. plans for&#13;
backfilling of overburden and reclamation of land).&#13;
Project implementation&#13;
3.10   Coal India executes all of its projects through its subsidiary coal companies. The physical imple-&#13;
mentation of the various environmental and social action plans will be carried out by the managers&#13;
('project officers' or 'agents') in charge of the 25 mines. In implementing these plans mine managers&#13;
receive support from specialized offices at the 'area' and 'subsidiary' levels. Most of the procurement,&#13;
monitoring of project implementation and liason with State and local agencies is done by these specialized&#13;
offices. Annex 3.2 shows the detailed organizational arrangements for the implementation of the project.&#13;
3.11   To ensure the timely implementation of this project, as well as the Coal Sector Rehabilitation&#13;
Project, Coal India has arranged for support from its environmental experts in CMPDI to strengthen the&#13;
Environmental Cell; signed a contract with the Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Manage-&#13;
ment, which provided a team of social science professionals to support the work and training activities of&#13;
the Resettlement and Rehabilitation Cell; and hired a team of 3-4 expatriate consultants to assist the&#13;
Procurement Cell.&#13;
3.12   Coal India will provide guidance for the implementation of the Environmental Action Plans, the&#13;
Indigenous Peoples Development Plans, the Rehabilitation Action Plans and the remedial social action&#13;
programs for mines that have received financial support from the Bank in the past. Coal India has estab-&#13;
lished a separate unit for this purpose ('World Bank Projects Division') at its headquarters in Calcutta. The&#13;
12 staff of the unit have been grouped into five cells: Environment, Resettlement and Rehabilitation,&#13;
Procurement, Finance and Economics and Project Monitoring. The unit is headed by a Chief General&#13;
Manager, an executive with more than 25 years experience in all facets of the coal industry.&#13;
3.13   Since environmental management is recognized as a separate management function within Coal&#13;
India's corporate management structure, appropriate positions have been created at all corporate levels,&#13;
(subsidiary headquarters, areas and mines) and staffed with executives that have been trained in Coal&#13;
India's Staff College or outside the company. While all of these executives have a background as either&#13;
mining or civil engineers, the additional training on environmental management ensured that they are well&#13;
qualified to implement environmental mitigation programs.&#13;
3.14   Resettlement, rehabilitation and community development was traditionally dealt with by Welfare&#13;
Officers posted at each mine. With the shift into opencast mining and the need for more land, the role of&#13;
these officers has become increasingly important. Coal India is currently in the process of setting up a&#13;
organizational structure for the management of social issues similar to the one for environmental manage-&#13;
ment. While the positions have been created, the staffing with properly trained personnel has yet to be&#13;
completed. Since it will not be possible to recruit a social scientist for each of the 25 selected mines&#13;
quickly enough to maintain the timetable for implementation of Rehabilitation Action Plans and Indig-&#13;
enous Peoples Development Plans, Coal India will properly train and deploy its Welfare Officers to act as&#13;
Community Development/Resettlement and Rehabilitation Officers. If the workload requires, Coal India&#13;
will deploy additional officers. Coal India has agreed to post, by December 31, 1996, a full-time Com-&#13;
munity Development/Resettlement and Rehabilitation Officer at each of the 25 mines to coordinate the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
implementation of the Rehabilitation Action Plans and Indigenous Peoples Development Plans and to&#13;
provide these officers with appropriate training in participatory community development.&#13;
3.15   Unlike the implementation of Rehabilitation Action Plans, which will be the sole responsibility of&#13;
Coal India, the implementation of Indigenous Peoples Development Plans will be shared with the commu-&#13;
nities that will ultimately benefit from these Plans. The purpose of this arrangement is to ensure that the&#13;
projects that will be eventually financed under these plans have the full support of the communities; in&#13;
addition, the communities have to demonstrate that they are willing to contribute to these projects either in&#13;
cash or kind and are prepared to maintain them. Coal India's Community Development/Resettlement and&#13;
Rehabilitation Officers will work closely with local NGOs and community based organizations in the&#13;
implementation of the Resettlement Action Plans and the Indigenous Peoples Development Plans. Coal&#13;
India has agreed to invite, by September 30, 1996, from qualified NGOs or specialized local organiza-&#13;
tions, proposals that would assist Coal India in implementing the Resettlement Action Plans and the&#13;
Indigenous Peoples Development Plans and to appoint these NGOs or specialized community organiza-&#13;
tions by December 31, 1996.&#13;
3.16   Annex 3.2 shows the major stages of project implementation. The Project Implementation Plan&#13;
contains the detailed implementation schedules for the environmental and social action plans. The Bank's&#13;
staff estimates that Coal India will be able to implement all of these plans within five years. The project is&#13;
expected to be completed by December 31, 2000. All Environmental Action Plans, Indigenous Peoples&#13;
Development Plans and Rehabilitation Action Plans have been reviewed by the Bank's staff. Government&#13;
approvals, to the extent that they are required for the implementation of these plans, have been obtained&#13;
and the bidding documents for major items have been prepared.&#13;
3.17   PROJECT MONITORING AND SUPERVISION. Detailed implementation schedules for the environmental&#13;
and social action plans have been prepared. They are contained in the Project Implementation Plan and&#13;
summarized in Annex 3.2. To monitor the progress of their implementation, Coal India has set up a&#13;
Project Monitoring Cell in its World Bank Projects Division. The main tool of this Cell will be a comput-&#13;
erized project management system which has been developed by the Project Monitoring Cell. It will&#13;
permit the staff of this cell to follow up on implementation activities on a daily basis and to discover&#13;
potential delays early on. Coal India has agreed to provide the Association with quarterly progress&#13;
reports in a standardformat that would track the physical implementation of the various project compo-&#13;
nents, procurement and disbursement These reports would also quantify and compare progress with&#13;
agreed performance indicators and highlight any emerging problems and constraints. The principal aim of&#13;
the quarterly reports is to provide the Association with a clear indication whether a specific mine is in full&#13;
compliance with the agreed implementation schedule for the social and environmental action plans. In&#13;
addition, Coal India has agreed to prepare a Midterm Review ofproject progress not later than Decem-&#13;
ber 31, 1998.&#13;
3.18   The above project review and reporting arrangements are designed to facilitate project supervision&#13;
by the Association. Support from the Association would consist of a main supervision mission annually,&#13;
supported by one or two brief, mid-year visits; technical advice based on the experience with the imple-&#13;
mentation of similar projects in other countries; and the necessary clearances. Supervision by the Associa-&#13;
tion would be based on the review of Annual Project Implementation Plans. (See Supervision Schedule,&#13;
Annex 3.2.) In view of the large number of mining projects spread over five States, it would be physically&#13;
impossible to carry out regular reviews of project implementation in the field. Coal India has agreed to&#13;
arrange a 'Project Monitoring Consultancy' by August 31, 1996, through a contract with a team of&#13;
experienced consultants, satisfactory the the Association, that would assist the Project Monitoring Cell&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
in the periodic review and assessment of the implementation of the social and environmental action&#13;
plans in line with annual supervision plans acceptable to the Association and to maintain the above&#13;
arrangements for the duration of the project. The consultant team would visit each mine project at least&#13;
once during each quarter. Its reports would be made available to the Project Monitoring Cell, the Govem-&#13;
ment and the Association. The costs of the consultancy would be reimbursable under the proposed credit.&#13;
Project cost&#13;
3.19     The project is estimated to cost US$84.0 million equivalent, including physical and price contin-&#13;
gencies and taxes of US$4.1 million equivalent (Table 3.1). The respective amounts for the implementa-&#13;
tion of Environmental Action Plans, Indigenous Peoples Development Plans, Rehabilitation Action Plans,&#13;
project monitoring and social remedial action are shown in Table 3.2. Because of the nature of the project,&#13;
only 10.3% of the estimated project cost will be in foreign exchange. The proposed credit of US$63.0&#13;
million equivalent would finance all of the foreign exchange cost and about 72% of the local cost.&#13;
3.20    Estimated project costs are expressed in mid-1995/96 prices which have been derived from  recent&#13;
contracts involving similar services and equipment. Physical contingencies of 10% of the base cost have&#13;

been included for in the total project cost. For components, suchs as community development infrastruc-&#13;
ture, technical reclamation and effluent treatment plants, where there is a fairly high likelihood that actual&#13;
requirements and expenditures could exceed Coal India's current estimates, correspondingly higher&#13;
physical contingencies were taken into account. Local price contingencies are based on projections of&#13;
local inflation of 8.5% in 1996, 8% in 1997, 7.5% in 1998, 7% in 1999 and 6% in 2000. Foreign price&#13;
contingencies have been estimated on the basis of the following projected rates of international inflation:&#13;
3.3% in 1996, 2.3% in 1997, 2.5% in 1998, 2.5% in 1999 and 2.5% in 2000. Taxes and customs duties on&#13;
imports were estimated on the basis of average rates provided by Coal India.&#13;
Financing plan&#13;
3.21    The financing plan for the proposed project, which has been agreed with the Government and Coal&#13;
India, is summarized in Table 3.3. The proposed IDA credit of US$63.0 million equivalent would finance&#13;
75% of the total project cost (79% exclusive of taxes and duties estimated at US$4.1 million). Coal India's&#13;
contribution to the project would be US$21.0 million.&#13;
3.22    The proposed credit would be made available to the Government on standard terms and conditions&#13;
and onlent to Coal India under standard terms and conditions for loans to commercial enterprises. Nor-&#13;
mally, these carry an interest rate of 16% per annum with a repayment period of ten years and a grace&#13;
period of one year. The Government would bear the foreign exchange risk. Coal India has agreed to set&#13;
up and maintain a system of separate accounts, satisfactory to the Association for the funds that would&#13;
be disbursed under this project&#13;

3.23    Coal India's World Bank Projects Cell has reviewed the technical feasibility, equipment specifica-&#13;
tions, investment requirements, procurement scheduling and disbursement profiles of the 25 mine projects&#13;
for which Coal India has requested financial support under the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project. Envi-&#13;
ronmental Action Plans, Indigenous Peoples Development Plans and Rehabilitation Action Plans for these&#13;
25 mines have been reviewed by the Association and found to be in line with the Operational Directives of&#13;
the Bank Group. The terms of reference for most technical assistance components have been drafted&#13;
(Annex 2.9). An Environmental Impact Assessment of the Indian Coal Sector and a Summary of this&#13;
Assessment have been prepared by Coal India. These documents have been reviewed by the Association&#13;
and found to be satisfactory. Coal India has signed contracts for the preparation of the safety engineering&#13;
studies of about 150 overburden dumps. These studies are expected to be completed by August 15, 1996.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
3.24    Table 3.4 summarizes the procurement arrangements for this project. The proposed credit will&#13;
finance civil works contracts (US$43.6 million equivalent), the purchase of equipment and materials&#13;
(US$11.5 million equivalent) and vehicles (US$0.3 million equivalent), technical assistance including&#13;
training, studies and NGO contracts (US$7.3 million equivalent) and social remedial action (US$0.3&#13;

million equivalent). All procurement under the IDA credit will follow the Bank's guidelines for procure-&#13;
ment and carried out on the basis of standard bidding documents. The following paragraphs summarize the&#13;
procurement arrangements that will be followed for major procurement categories.&#13;
3.25   LAND. The estimated project cost for this category (US$2.9 million) includes the compensation of&#13;
the purchase of land and homesteads Coal India needs to acquire for continued production of coal in the 25&#13;
selected mines and associated resettlement sites. Coal India would finance the cost of land acquisition.&#13;
3.26   CIVIL WORKS (US$48.6 million). Civil works contracts under this project fall into two broad&#13;
categories:&#13;
(a)  SMALL WORKS CONTRACTS. These include contracts for such items as the construction of&#13;
primary school buildings, primary health care facilities or water supply systems in villages as&#13;
part of the implementation of Rehabilitation Action Plans or Indigenous Peoples Develop-&#13;
ment Plans. Because of the remote locations of these villages, procurement would be carried&#13;
out through direct contracting with non-government or community based organizations or on&#13;
the basis of quotations solicited from at least three qualified contractors. Each of these&#13;
contracts will have a value of US$15,000 or less; and the combined value of these contracts&#13;
would be about US$ 1.4 million.&#13;
(b) CONTRACTS WHOSE VALUE EXCEEDS us$15,000. Roughly half of the contracts for civil works&#13;
are valued at US$15,000-200,000. Their combined value is approximately US$15.2 million.&#13;
In addition, there are about 60 contracts with a combined value of US$32.0 million, whose&#13;
individual value exceeds US$200,000. Most of the civil works contracts in this group are for&#13;
items such as the construction of dust suppression arrangements, effluent treatment systems,&#13;
surface water drainage channels, settling ponds, roads and the reshaping and biological&#13;
reclamation of overburden dumps. Although some contracts may be as high as US$3.5&#13;
inillion, the locations of these civil works contracts are spread over too wide a geographical&#13;
area to be of interest to intemational bidders. Thus, all civil works contracts whose value&#13;
exceeds US$15,000 would be awarded on the basis of National Competitive Bidding (NCB)&#13;
procedures satisfactory to the Association. International contractors would be eligible to&#13;
participate. Although no ICB works contracts are expected, any works contract exceeding&#13;
US$3.5 million would be subject to ICB procedures.&#13;
3.27   EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS AND VEHICLES (US$14.9 million). Under this category, 90 contracts (with a&#13;
combined value of US$0.6 million) are valued at US$15,000 or less and about 40 contracts (with a com-&#13;
bined value of US$2.0 million) are valued at US$15,000-US$200,000. Most of these contracts in this latter&#13;
category are for environmental monitoring equipment, analytical laboratories, fire fighting, and dust&#13;
suppression. These contracts would be awarded on the basis of NCB procedures acceptable to the Associa-&#13;
tion. In addition, there will be about 30 contracts (with a combined value of US$12.0 million) valued at&#13;
more than US$200,000. Most of these contracts are for the procurement of water sprinklers. They will be&#13;
grouped together into a single package and procured under ICB procedures satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
3.28   The proposed project would also provide funds for the procurement of vans equipped for environ-&#13;
mental monitoring, jeeps and motorcycles that would enable community development officers to supervise&#13;
the implementation of Resettlement Action Plans and Indigenous Peoples Development Plans. Individual&#13;
contracts for vehicles would not exceed US$13,000 and their combined value would be about US$0.3&#13;
million. The vehicles would be procured under national shopping procedures, because procurement would&#13;
involve a variety of types of vehicles spread over a five-year period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
3.29   The Bank's standard procurement documents would be used for all procurement under ICB and&#13;
NCB. For a comparison of bids from domestic and foreign suppliers in the case of ICB, qualified domestic&#13;
bidders would be allowed a margin of preference in accordance with the provisions of paras. 2.54 and 2.55&#13;
of the Bank's procurement guidelines (January 1995).&#13;
3.30   TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, TRAINING AND STUDIES (US$7.3 million). Expenditures under this category&#13;
would be for support of the implementation of the project (US$6.1 million), policy support (US$0.3&#13;
million) and institutional capacity building (US$0.9 million). Expenditures in this category include&#13;
contracts with NGOs (US$1.8 million) for assistance in the implementation of Rehabilitation Action Plans&#13;
and Indigenous Peoples Development Plans. There are about 50 contracts included in this category. The&#13;
individual costs of four of these contracts will exceed US$250,000. Five contracts are projected to cost&#13;
between US$100,000 and US$250,000. The remaining contracts are all valued at less than US$100,000.&#13;
The terms and conditions of contracts valued above US$100,000 would be guided by the "Guidelines for&#13;
the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the World Bank as Executing Agency" (August&#13;
1981). The remaining contracts are too small and spread over the five-year implementation period of the&#13;
project to be of any interest to international consultants.&#13;
3.31   NGO PARTICIPATION (US$ 1.8 million). In order to encourage comnunity participation and ensure&#13;
that local communities benefit to the maximum extent from the implementation of Resettlement Action&#13;
Plans and Indigenous Peoples Development Plans, Coal India will give preference to bidders that employ&#13;
local people and local NGOs. Since neither local bidders nor NGOs would have adequate financial back-&#13;
ing to submit the necessary financial guarantees with their bids, Coal India and the Association have&#13;
agreed to modify the respective requirements of the procurement guidelines.&#13;
3.32   MISCELLANEOUS (US$10.3 million). This category of expenditures covers the following:&#13;
(a)  INCREMENTAL OPERATING COSTS (US$9.6 million). Most of the expenditures under this&#13;
category are for additional environmental monitoring and the implementation assistance for&#13;
Resettlement Action Plans and Indigenous Peoples Development Plans by specialized staff&#13;
Coal India will hire for this purpose. All these activities would be financed by Coal India.&#13;
(b) OTHER RESETTLEMENT BENEFITS (US$0.4 million). This includes expenditures for the compen-&#13;
sation for homesteads acquired by Coal India under the proposed Coal Sector Rehabilitation&#13;
Project, subsistence payments to eligible project-affected persons and the cost of transferring&#13;
eligible affected people to resettlement sites. All of these activities would be financed by&#13;
Coal India.&#13;
(C) SOCIAL REMEDIAL ACTION (US$ 0.3 million). As indicated in para 3.6 above, Coal India would&#13;
provide the Association with an action program that would ensure that the incomes of all&#13;
project-affected persons under coal projects that have received financial support from the&#13;
Bank in the past would exceed the poverty level.&#13;
3.33   REVIEW OF CONTRACTS. Goods contracts valued at US$200,000 and more and civil works contracts&#13;
valued at US$500,000 or more would be subject to prior review by the Association. In addition, the first&#13;
ten civil works contracts with a value of US$200,000-500,000 would be subject to prior review. Contracts&#13;
for goods valued at less than US$200,000 would be subject to post review. Civil works valued below&#13;
US$15.,000 would be subject to a random post review. Contracts for technical assistance valued at&#13;
US$100,000 or more that are scheduled for signing during the first year of project implementation have&#13;
been submitted to the Association for review before negotiations. Consulting services with firms valued at&#13;
US$100,000 or more and with individuals valued at US$50,000 or more would be subject to prior review.&#13;
In sum, about 50% of all contracts would be subject to prior review by the Association.&#13;

Disbursements&#13;
3.34    The phasing of the projected disbursements of the proposed IDA credit is shown in detail in&#13;
Annex 3.2 and summarized in Table 3.5. Disbursements are based on the assumption that the credit will&#13;
become effective by the end of the fourth quarter of FY96. While the projected disbursement period of&#13;
five years is substantially shorter than would be indicated with the Bank's experience with the implemen-&#13;
tation of environmental and social components in energy projects, the advanced state of project prepara-&#13;
tion makes this a realistic assessment. Coal India has worked closely with the Association to minimize the&#13;
risk of implementation delays and thus delays in the disbursements of the IDA credit. Based on the&#13;
projected schedule of expenditures a closing date for the IDA credit of June 30, 2001 has been established.&#13;
3.35    To facilitate disbursements a Special Account would be established with an authorized allocation&#13;
of US$3.0 million, which is equivalent to about three months of average disbursements. Disbursements&#13;
against civil works contracts valued at US$500,000 and above, the first ten civil works contracts valued at&#13;
US$200,000-500,000 and contracts for goods valued at US$200,000 and above would be fully docu-&#13;
mented. For individual consultants the limit would be US$50,000; for consulting firms, the limit would be&#13;
US$100,000. For all other expenditures, disbursement could be against the Statement of Expenditures.&#13;
Documentation for Statements of Expenditures would be retained by Coal India and made available to&#13;
IDA staff for review during supervision. The IDA credit would be disbursed against the categories out-&#13;
lined in Table 3.6.&#13;

IV. FINANCLkL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
Project benefits&#13;
4.1    While the Environmental and Social Mitigation Project has significant social and environmental&#13;
benefits that would justify the implementation of this project on its own merits, quantification of these&#13;
benefits would need to be based on highly subjective judgements. In view of the close linkage between&#13;
this and the proposed Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project, quantification of the financial and economic&#13;
benefits of the latter would justify both projects. The following paragraphs will first describe the social&#13;
and environmental benefits of the Environmental and Social Mitigation Project, and then provide a&#13;
summary of the financial and economic analysis of the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project.&#13;
Social and environmental benefits&#13;
Social benefits&#13;
4.2    The implementation of the Environmental and Social Mitigation Project will safeguard the reha-&#13;
bilitation of 9,260 people and the proper resettlement of about 10,000 people. In terms of the number of&#13;
people affected, the implementation of the Indigenous Peoples Development Plans is more important and&#13;
will improve the lives of about 186,000 people, of which 56,900 would be tribals. On its own Coal India&#13;
will need to extend the benefits of its resettlement and rehabilitation policy and its community develop-&#13;
ment policy to much larger number of people. It is simply not possible to limit these benefits in large&#13;
coalfields to small isolated groups of people. However, it is also clear that without the involvement of the&#13;
Association and the Bank, these benefits would not materialize.&#13;
Environmental benefits&#13;
4.3   Implementation of the Environmental Action Plans will have a significant impact on Coal India's&#13;
management of land and water resources, as well as its control of air and noise pollution.&#13;
With regard to land management:&#13;
*   Revegetation of degraded land will help generate fuel, timber and other forest products,&#13;
which will help tribals and reduce the pressure on existing forests.&#13;
*   Large scale plantation after proper preparation of surface land will reduce soil erosion and&#13;
consequent soil losses.&#13;
*   Improved plantation coverage and recontouring of the land will substantially reduce the&#13;
siltation of rivers due to erosion in the catchment areas of coal mines.&#13;
*   Replanted and revegetated areas could later be handed over to State Forest Departments in&#13;
lieu of their requirement of compensatory afforestation. This will reduce the cost of the coal&#13;
company, which include the cost of land acquisition and compensatory afforestation, if forest&#13;
land is used for mining purposes.&#13;
*   Proper land reclamation and adequate plantation will also provide effective barriers to noise&#13;
and air pollution between active mining areas and settlements.&#13;
*   Implementation of large-scale plantation programs in the selected 25 mines will upgrade the&#13;
general ecology of the surrounding areas.&#13;
*   Regrading of overburden dumps located close to settlements will contribute to the safety of&#13;
the people living there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
With regard to water management:&#13;
*   The emphasis on recycling and the reuse of industrial water will reduce the water require-&#13;
ments from natural sources. This will make more water available to rural and tribal areas.&#13;
*   The implementation of measures to improve water quality will eliminate or, at least reduce,&#13;
any adverse effects on the groundwater regime and substantially increase the availability of&#13;
potable groundwater.&#13;
*   Improvements in the quality of the water of the natural water system through controls on&#13;
water pollution in mining operations, will help the normal development and growth of&#13;
aquatics flora and fauna.&#13;
With regard to noise and air pollution control:&#13;
*   Strict adherence to air quality standards will improve living conditions in the settlement&#13;
surrounding the mining areas and should also contribute to a reduction of respiratory dis-&#13;
eases.&#13;
*   Construction of noise barriers will improve the living conditions in settlements close to&#13;
mining operations.&#13;
Financial and economic analysis&#13;
4.4.   As mentioned in para 4.1, the social and environmental programs that will be implemented under&#13;
the proposed project do not lend themselves to unambigous financial and economic analysis. Apart from&#13;
the description of the benefits of these programs (para 4.3) and their costs (para 3.19), the financial and&#13;
economic justification for implementing these programs rests on the economic viability of the associated&#13;
investments under the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project. The results of these analyses are contained in&#13;
Annex 4.1. They show that the investments for each of the 25 mines included in the program carry finan-&#13;
cial and economic rates of return in excess of 16% per annum. From a financial and economic perspective&#13;
the investments under the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project are robust. None of the investments showed a&#13;
rate below 16% per annum after taking into account multiple and project-specific risks using Monte-Carlo&#13;
simulations.&#13;
Project risks&#13;
4.5    COAL INDIA'S COMMITMENT TO THE PROJECT. The main risk the project faces would be a waning of&#13;
Coal India's commitment to its implementation, in case Bank support for the Coal Sector Rehabilitation&#13;
Project fails to materialize within a reasonable time horizon. Coal India has followed the Association's&#13;
advice in enhancing its environmental and social policies. It is doubtful that Coal India would have done&#13;
so without the prospects of Bank support for its investment and reform programs. In light of the pressures&#13;
Coal India faces from people living in coal mining areas, the company is committed to making coal&#13;
production more environmentally and socially sustainable. However, it is unlikely that Coal India would&#13;
implement all the enhancements, in particular those with regard to participation of project-affected people,&#13;
rehabilitation of the landless and community development, without support under the Coal Sector Reha-&#13;
bilitation Project.&#13;
4.6   IMPLEMENTATION OF COAL INDIA'S RESETTLEMENT AND REHABILITATION POLICY. As indicated in&#13;
Chapter II, Coal India has traditionally provided employment to project-affected families as part of the&#13;
compensation for land acquired from them. The extremely high wages offered by Coal India and the&#13;
security of employment (and the fact that jobs could be frequently passed on to a family member upon&#13;
retirement) made this a highly desirable form of compensation. With the cut in budgetary support, Coal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
India had to drastically reduce its offers of employment. Coal India's revised policy for resettlement and&#13;
rehabilitation places therefore greater emphasis on assisting project-affected people in developing opportu-&#13;
nities for self-employment.&#13;
4.7    Since the revised policy was adopted in April 1994 several lessons have been learned: Training in&#13;
itself for self employment is not enough, even when it is supported by loans or grants. The majority of&#13;
project-affected persons are farmers or agricultural laborers, and the transition into a new profession&#13;
requires a considerable amount of follow-up assistance. To reduce pressures for employment, Coal India is&#13;
keen to see this policy succeed and is working closely with NGOs that can offer assistance in this respect.&#13;
To learn from the experiences of others, Coal India organized a workshop on income generation and self-&#13;
employment in rural Eastem India in March 1995 that brought together NGOs, Govenmment agencies and&#13;
rural banks. In addition to providing a platform for a dialogue with the NGO community about this&#13;
project, it provided Coal India with an idea of the scope of experience and resources NGOs could offer. To&#13;
enhance the chances of making self-employment a viable altemative to employment with the coal compa-&#13;
nies, Coal India will continue to seek the close participation of NGOs in the implementation of this policy.&#13;
4.8    MAINTENANCE OF INFRASTRUCTURE IN COMMUNITIES. Both Coal India's revised Resettlement and&#13;
Rehabilitation Policy and the Community Development Policy embodied in the Indigenous Peoples&#13;
Development Plan require that Coal India provides extensive infrastructure facilities, such as schools,&#13;
clinics, roads, wells, tanks, piped water, street lighting, etc. Coal India has provided such facilities in the&#13;
past. Experience has shown that the people who were to benefit from these facilities made no efforts to&#13;
maintain them. Coal India found it too expensive to use its own (expensive) manpower to maintain these&#13;
facilities. The result was that many of these facilities fell quickly into disrepair. This has been pointed out&#13;
in numerous reviews of resettlement sites. To safeguard against this risk, Coal India is providing support&#13;
to Village Councils (under its Community Development Policy) to build up the commitment and capacity&#13;
in the affected communities to maintain these facilities.&#13;
V. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
5.01   The following agreements have been reached:&#13;
(a) With the Govermment that it will:&#13;
(i)  submit to the Association the audit report of the Special Account and the Statement of&#13;
Expenses, if any, within nine months of the end of the fiscal year (para 2.31); and&#13;
(ii)  onlend the funds from the IDA credit to Coal India Ltd. under standard terms and&#13;
conditions for loans to commercial enterprises. (para 3.22).&#13;
(b) With Coal India that it will:&#13;
(i)  review with the Association, by June 30, 1997, a program, satisfactory to the Associa-&#13;
tion, to strengthen its environmental management capacity and to implement the&#13;
program over the following eighteen months (para 2.4);&#13;
(ii)  seek extension of environmental clearances from appropriate authorities for each of&#13;
the selected 25 mines before expiration of the current clearance and to take all re-&#13;
quired action to obtain the approvals and furnish them to the Association.(para 2.5);&#13;
(iii)  submit the mine emergency plans for the 25 selected mines, by December 31, 1996, to&#13;
an intemational expert team for review and, if required, update these plans in line with&#13;
their recommendations (para 2.8);&#13;
&#13;

Annex 2.1 ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The steep increase in coal production brought with it the potential for significant adverse impacts&#13;
on the natural and human environments. These impacts are most obvious on large opencast projects and&#13;
include the sheer scale of physical site disturbance and disruption of existing land use; generation of fine,&#13;
airborne dust particles from haul road traffic, blasting, excavation and material transfer; equipment noise;&#13;
degradation of surface water and groundwater quality resulting from the discharge of mine water; erosion&#13;
of disturbed land surfaces; leachates from waste materials; and hydrological modifications due to ground-&#13;
water drawdown and the disruption of surface drainage patterns. Underground mining, though less intru-&#13;
sive, can result in water quality degradation through the discharge of contaminated mine water, the disrup-&#13;
tion of groundwater and soil moisture regimes, smoke pollution and surface caving from underground&#13;
fires, and surface instability and subsidence due to the collapse of mined-out workings. All of these&#13;
impacts can be at least mitigated, and in some cases avoided all together, by appropriate mine planning&#13;
and design, responsive operational practice, and the timely, effective reclamation of land disturbances.&#13;
2.     Over the past two decades, the Central and State Governments have established a legal and&#13;
institutional regime for the protection of the environment and the management of adverse environmental&#13;
impacts. These government initiatives have occurred against a backdrop of growing concerns about&#13;
environmental and social issues by an increasingly knowledgeable public. Environmental and social&#13;
NGOs have been organized in India with strong links to international organizations. Like other industrial&#13;
sectors, the coal industry will face growing opposition to further expansion in many areas, unless it can&#13;
demonstrate that it can carry out its operations in an environmentally and socially responsible manner.&#13;
Environmental legislation and regulations&#13;
Legislation&#13;
3.     The conditions for environmental management and protection in all industrial activities are&#13;
established by four statutes of the Government of India: The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution)&#13;
Act (1974); The Forest (Conservation) Act (1980), The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act&#13;
(1981), and The Environmental (Protection) Act (1986). The most important provisions of these acts may&#13;
be summarized as follows:&#13;
*   THE WATER (PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF POLLUTION) ACT AND THE AIR (PREVENTION AND&#13;
CONTROL OF POLLUTION) ACT. The most important provision of these two acts is to establish,&#13;
and define the respective powers and functions of, Central and State Pollution Control&#13;
Boards. These acts prohibit waste emissions or discharges without written consent from, and&#13;
regulate payment of fees to, the State Pollution Control Boards; establish procedures for&#13;
enforcement of environmental standards, letters of consent and other orders or directives of&#13;
the Boards; and prescribe penalties for non-compliance.&#13;
*   THE ENVIRONMENTAL (PROTECTION) ACT. This act provides legal authority for environmental&#13;
protection in areas not covered by other acts and establishes the authority for the Ministry of&#13;
Environment and Forests to assume a lead role in long-term environmental management and&#13;
short-term response to environmental emergencies. The power of the Ministry to issue&#13;
directions includes "the power to direct the closure, prohibition, or regulation of any indus-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Annex 2.1&#13;
Page 2 of 14&#13;
try, operation or process, or the stoppage or regulation of the supply of electricity, water or&#13;
any other service". The measures assumed by the Central Government under this act now&#13;
include: nationwide waste management planning; establishing objectives for the quality of&#13;
the environment; laying down standards for all sources of pollution emissions and dis-&#13;
charges; designation of areas where certain types of industries may not operate or may&#13;
operate only under specified restrictions; development of environmental emergency response&#13;
and contingency planning procedures; hazardous substance regulations; environmental&#13;
protection and waste management research; inspections of waste generating facilities and the&#13;
issuance of pollution prevention, control and abatement orders; establishment or "recogni-&#13;
tion" of environmental laboratories; and the preparation of environmental management&#13;
manuals, codes and guidelines. Power is provided to require waste-generating operations to&#13;
submit information on their environmental management performance; for example, all&#13;
industrial facilities operating under environmental clearances or letters of consent from the&#13;
State Pollution Control Boards must file semi-annual environmental audit reports. The act&#13;
prescribes penalties for non-compliance with standards and orders at levels considerably&#13;
higher than the previous statutes, and gives the Central Government power to delegate its&#13;
authority and functions as it considers necessary, subject to conditions, to any officer, State&#13;
Government or other authority.&#13;
THE FOREST (CONSERVATION) ACT. The act states that no Govemment authority shall permit&#13;
the removal land from a forest reserve or use forest land for a nonforest purpose without&#13;
prior approval of the Central Government. In practice approval to occupy forest land for&#13;
mining is usually included in the environmental clearance for a project and entails offsite&#13;
compensatory reforestation of an equal area of forest land or one and one half times the area&#13;
of degraded land.&#13;
Regulations&#13;
4.     Both the air and water pollution control acts contain provisions for the establishment of regula-&#13;
tions, however the more recent Environment (Protection) Act largely subsumes their regulatory role. The&#13;
regulations that exist under the two earlier acts relate primarily to the operating rules and procedures of the&#13;
Central and State Pollution Control Boards. Regulations have been established under the new act relating&#13;
to pollution discharge and emission standards, the process for environmental impact assessment and the&#13;
issuance of environmental clearances. Where environmental quality objectives and pollution standards&#13;
have not been formally established by regulation, the Indian Standards, which do not have force of law in&#13;
themselves, provide interim guidance. Current regulations of greatest relevance to the coal sector can be&#13;
summarized as follows:&#13;
5.     AMBIENT OBJECTIVES FOR AIR AND WATER QUALITY AND NOISE. Ambient environmental objectives are&#13;
normally set to protect public health and sensitive natural resources such as fisheries, vegetation and soil&#13;
productivity. Ambient environment objectives become a basis for assessing and managing the cumulative&#13;
impacts of point-source discharges or emissions, which are usually regulated by permits or consent letters,&#13;
and non-point or dispersed pollution sources that are not usually amenable to direct regulation.&#13;
6.     Ambient objectives have been established for drinking water quality (Indian Standard 10500,&#13;
1983), air quality (Central Pollution Control Board), and noise (Environment Protection Rules, 1986,&#13;
Schedule III). These parameters are generally consistent with standards elsewhere in the world under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Annex 2.1&#13;
Page 3 of 14&#13;
similar conditions and, if appropriately enforced, should adequately protect public health and the environ-&#13;
ment. Possible exceptions to this general consistency with world standards relate to suspended particulates&#13;
in air and nitrates in water. It is not considered desirable to maintain the maximum permitted suspended&#13;
particulate level in air on a regular basis. For this reason, many jurisdictions are now posing their objec-&#13;
tives on both a maximum 24hr and an annual average basis. Given normal seasonal climatic variations&#13;
these standards are normally achievable with good management. It should be noted here that the industrial&#13;
air quality standard applies only to the general operational zone on coal mines, not to the intensive work-&#13;
ing area where standards are set by the Director General of Mine Safety under the Coal Mines Regula-&#13;
tions. These regulations allow suspended particulate levels up to 3000ug/m3 depending on silica content.&#13;
Recent concerns about the possible effects of nitrates in drinking water on the unborn fetus have prompted&#13;
some jurisdictions to reduce acceptable ambient nitrate levels to the 10 to 20mg/l range. This parameter is&#13;
of special concern to the mining industry because of the possibility of nitrates from uncombusted explo-&#13;
sives leaching to surface and ground water from overburden dumps. Fortunately the problem is easily&#13;
manageable through plastic drillhole linings or switching to slurry-gel explosives during wet conditions.&#13;
7.     DISCHARGE AND EMISSION STANDARDS. This type of standard is usually applicable only to discrete,&#13;
point-sources of pollution, the typical 'stacks and pipes.' The great majority of air quality problems on a&#13;
minesite result from mobile and dispersed pollution sources (vehicles on roads, blasting and material&#13;
transfer points) and are much more amenable to regulation through the application of ambient standards.&#13;
Waste water discharge standards, established under Schedule II of the Environment (Protection) Rules&#13;
1986 and subsequent Gazetted Notice No. 120 of May 19, 1993, apply to a number of points on mine&#13;
sites: decants from settling ponds associated with minewater collection systems; wastewater from equip-&#13;
ment maintenance and storage facilities; and discharges from domestic sewage treatment systems. These&#13;
standards are generally consistent with those used in similar conditions in other jurisdictions. The environ-&#13;
mental protection rules require State Pollution Control Boards to take into account the assimilative capac-&#13;
ity of receiving-waters at seasonal low flows "so that the quality of the intended use of the receiving&#13;
waters is not affected". Where such quality is likely to be affected, discharge may not be allowed.&#13;
8.     LAND RECLAMATION STANDARDS. Beyond standard statements in the environmental clearance that&#13;
the ultimate slopes of overburden dumps should be maintained at a maximum of 28 degrees, topsoil shall&#13;
be conserved for reclamation use, and land reclamation shall be carried out "to make it compatible with&#13;
the pre-mining land use pattern", there are no quantitative standards that define successful reclamation.&#13;
Presently, reclamation focuses on wood plantations. It must also be noted that the present system - where&#13;
Coal India must pay the cost of acquiring private lands, fund compensatory reforestation for lost forest&#13;
lands, carTy out reclamation and, after all this, surrender the land back to the Government at no cost -&#13;
provides no incentive at all, at present coal prices, to the company to do much more than carry out reveg-&#13;
etation.&#13;
The environmental impact assessment process&#13;
9.     Environmental impact assessment (EIA) in various forms has been applied to development&#13;
projects in India since 1982. Gazetted Notice No. 72 of January 28, 1993 provided the first consolidated&#13;
direction on the EIA process. It has subsequently been modified by a further notification dated January 27,&#13;
1994 and amended on May 4, 1994. Lead agencies for the process are the Ministry of Environment and&#13;
Forests in the Central Government and the Departrnent of Environment and State Pollution Control Board&#13;
at the State level. The notice stipulates that no project prescribed in the schedules shall be undertaken&#13;
without environmental clearance from the appropriate level of government. Such clearance shall be based&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
Annex 2.1&#13;
Page 4 of 14&#13;
on an approved Environmental Management Plan (EMP) containing a quantitative (baseline) description&#13;
of the existing environment, a project description, an analysis of potential environmental impacts and an&#13;
acceptable plan for the management of those impacts. The 1994 notice modifies the schedule of projects&#13;
requiring clearance from the Central Government.&#13;
10.   Under the 1993 notice only coal mining projects requiring environmental clearance from the&#13;
Central Government needed to prepare Environment Management Plans. In practice that meant projects&#13;
that involved either the conversion of forest land or a total capital investment greater than Rs5OO million.&#13;
The 1994 notice now requires Central Government environmental clearance for all mining projects "with&#13;
leases more than 5ha". To its credit Coal India recognized from the outset that the investment/forest&#13;
land criteria in the original schedule were too narrow and has voluntarily prepared Environmental&#13;
Management Plans for all new projects and expansions. Environmental Action Plans are being pre-&#13;
pared for projects that predated the environmental regulations (as staff resources permit). In addition to the&#13;
environmental clearance, the 1994 notice requires mining projects, pithead thermal power stations, and&#13;
three other categories of industry to obtain site clearances which "shall be granted for a sanctioned capac-&#13;
ity and shall be valid for a period of five years for commencing.. .mining". Though not explicitly stated in&#13;
the notice, it is assumed that application for, and granting of, site clearance would precede the preparation&#13;
of project feasibility studies, the Environmental Management Plan and the application for environmental&#13;
clearance.&#13;
11.   DISSEMINATION. The process also makes provision for project review by a committee of experts and&#13;
for public hearings if the lead agency feels these measures are necessary. The 1993 notice provides&#13;
unlimited public access to project feasibility summaries, Environmental Management Plans, recommenda-&#13;
tions of the expert committee and the conditions under which environmental clearance was to be given.&#13;
12.   CONSULTATIONS. The evaluation of the Environmental Management Plan must be completed within&#13;
three months of its submission to the Government, at which time either a deficiency statement is given to&#13;
the proponent or an environmental clearance is issued, subject to such terms and conditions as the lead&#13;
agency deems necessary. In adjudicating the clearance and formulating the tenns and conditions, the lead&#13;
agency must consult with affected people. Where required, forest clearance is issued subject to the identi-&#13;
fication of land and the provision of funds for compensatory planting.&#13;
13.   AUDITS. Regular audits of compliance with environmental clearances must be undertaken and&#13;
reports of audits may be made available to the public by the lead agency, subject to the public interest.&#13;
14.   ENVIRONMENTAL APPROVALS. All projects, whether subject to environmental clearance or not, must&#13;
obtain Consent Letters from the SPCB for any discharges and emissions to the environment.&#13;
Policy and procedures for compliance and enforcement&#13;
15.   The various acts and regulations provide a sound basis for compliance and enforcement activities.&#13;
However, it seems that the performance of the environmental agencies in this regard has been somewhat&#13;
haphazard and inconsistent. There appear to be a number of reasons for this. State Departments of Envi-&#13;
ronment and Pollution Control Boards have limited resources to undertake regular, independent compli-&#13;
ance monitoring to verify implementation of environmental conditions and to check the monitoring data&#13;
submitted by companies. The letters of environmental clearance and pollution consent seldom provide a&#13;
practical definition of the degree of noncompliance that will elicit an enforcement response. Finally, the&#13;
enforcement actions available are limited (essentially the options are to do nothing, shut an operation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
Annex 2.1&#13;
Page 5 of 14&#13;
down or take the operator to court). Court action is usually so long and drawn-out that it does not provide&#13;
effective environmental protection. The lack of enforcement capability described above has led to a&#13;
backlog of noncompliance in Coal India's environmental performance. Coal India is committed to&#13;
strengthen its environmental management capability to enable 'self policing' of environmental laws and&#13;
regulations, independent of the Governments' enforcement capabilities. In addition, the backlog of non-&#13;
compliance will be corrected in the targeted 25 opencast mines of this project.&#13;
The environmental institutional set up&#13;
Central Government institutions&#13;
16.   The two major organizations concerned with environmental management in the Central Govern-&#13;
ment are the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the Central Pollution Control Board. The Ministry&#13;
is primarily responsible for: national environmental planning; comprehensive environmental objectives,&#13;
standards and codes of practice; and administering the EIA and environmental clearance processes,&#13;
particularly for projects requiring national approval. The major functions of the Board are to advise the&#13;
Ministry on pollution matters, including standards; to provide guidance and technical assistance to State&#13;
Boards; to carry out national research programs on pollution problems and abatement technologies; to&#13;
collect and publish national statistics on pollution; and to prepare manuals, codes and guides relating to the&#13;
prevention, control or abatement of pollution.&#13;
State Government institutions&#13;
17.   The relevant environmental agencies of State Governments include the Department of Environ-&#13;
ment, the Department of Forests and the State Pollution Control Board. The Department of Environment is&#13;
primarily responsible for administering the environmental assessment and clearance process for projects&#13;
under state jurisdiction, providing field advice to the Central Ministry on the assessment of projects under&#13;
the central EIA process, and undertaking audits of compliance with environmental clearances for all&#13;
projects. The primary roles of the Department of Forests in relation to environmental management in the&#13;
coal sector are to identify lands for compensatory replanting, to advise the Central Ministry on applica-&#13;
tions for forest conversion, and to undertake replanting of mining disturbances with funds provided by the&#13;
coal companies. The primary functions of the State Pollution Control Boards are to to issue consent letters&#13;
and collect fees for all pollution discharges and emissions to the environment and to inspect and monitor&#13;
waste-generating facilities for compliance with the conditions of the letters of consent and, where neces-&#13;
sary, issue orders for the prevention, control or abatement of pollution. The institutional setup of Central&#13;
and State Government environmental agencies shown in Figure 2.1.1.&#13;
Regional Planning Authorities&#13;
18.   In three coalfields (Singrauli, Korba and Talcher), Central and State Governments have estab-&#13;
lished Special Area Development Authorities to coordinate regional development activities. These authori-&#13;
ties comprise representatives of Central and State Government agencies, Coal India, National Thermal&#13;
Power Corporation, Indian Railways, private industrial corporations and local public groups. From the&#13;
perspective of environmental and social impact management, they have the potential to foster coordinated&#13;
regional environmental quality monitoring networks, integrated environmental management and pollution&#13;
abatement programs, the assembly of regional banks of non-forested and degraded lands for compensatory&#13;
afforestation, and the cooperative delivery of resettlement and community assistance programs.&#13;

Coal India's organisational structure for environmental management&#13;
19.    The primary responsibility for the implementation of Coal India's corporate environmental policy&#13;
(see Annex 2.2) will remain with Coal India headquarters in Calcutta, the coal producing subsidiaries and&#13;
CMPDI. In order to be able to address environmental issues more effectively, CMPDI, which provides&#13;
expert services for mine planning and design, environment and research, established in January 1993 an&#13;
Institute of Environment (IOE) at its head office at Ranchi and regional environmental cells at its regional&#13;
offices (see Figure 2.1.2). To safeguard the effective implementation of its environmental policy, Coal&#13;
India will carry out, as part of the proposed project, a review of its capacity to deal effectively with&#13;
environmental issues. This review will focus in particular on the need for changes in the organisational&#13;
structure, the skills and staffing requirements.&#13;
20.   Within the subsidiaries, environmental responsibilities are assigned to an Environmental Cell at&#13;
the company level, responsible for monitoring program implementation and liaison with State Govern-&#13;
ments; an environmental cell at the area level, responsible for program coordination; and individual&#13;
Environmental Departments on each project, responsible for program implementation. The area level is&#13;
felt to be necessary because of the great distances between separate coalfields. NCL is the only company&#13;
that does not organize at the area level because all of its nine mines are concentrated in the Singrauli area.&#13;
Few companies as yet have environmental cells and departments that are completely operational and&#13;
staffed with the full compliment of environmental professionals. At negotiations, agreement will be sought&#13;
with Coal India on a timetable for making environmental cells and departments fully operation so as to&#13;
safeguard the implementation of the Environmental Action Plans.&#13;
21.    CMPDI is an independent corporation within Coal India, providing scientific, planning and design&#13;
services to the parent company and its subsidiaries. CMPDI headquarters is responsible for coordination of&#13;
the regional offices, national liaison with Central Government agencies, and identifying and pursuing&#13;
priorities for research and development in all aspects of coal mining, including environmental manage-&#13;
ment. CMPDI's regional offices are responsible for all aspects of mine planning - from exploration to&#13;
government approvals and project implementation. They have the prime responsibility to ensure that&#13;
environmental considerations are incorporated in mine planning from the outset; generate Environmental&#13;
Management Plans, either in-house or through the administration of private consultant contracts; and&#13;
coordinate activities related to obtaining environmental clearances and letters of consent.&#13;
22.    Presently there is considerable variation among the subsidiaries in the implementation of Environ-&#13;
mental Management Plans and, particularly, in the quality of environmental monitoring programs. This&#13;
appears due, in large part, to the lack of any entity at the corporate level with the overall responsibility for&#13;
the consistency and quality of environmental programs. To deal with this issue Coal India has set up an&#13;
Environmental Cell at CMPDI with responsibility for corporate policy, monitoring the implementation,&#13;
and assessing the performance of environmental programs. Because of its reporting relationship to a Board&#13;
which includes Government officers and private experts and its strong scientific focus, CMPDI may be in&#13;
a position to play a strong objective role in improving the consistency and quality of environmental&#13;
monitoring and in undertaking independent performance audits and to introduce training programs.&#13;
Strengthening of Coal India 's environmental organization&#13;
23.    Recognizing Coal India's deficiencies in environmental management capability, CMPDI devel-&#13;
oped an environmental management plan in parallel with this project development. This plan includes a&#13;
definition of responsibilities of the environmental cells and a staffing program (Box 2.1.2).&#13;

24.       During project preparation, Coal India and the Bank's project team  concluded that the environ-&#13;
mental management organization may be required to cover a wider agenda than that envisaged by CMPDI.&#13;
To make sure that the full range of environmental responsibilities could be covered by the environmental&#13;
organization, the technical assistance component will include an institutional strengthening and implemen-&#13;
tation assistance study. The Terms of Reference for this study are described in Annex 2.8.&#13;
Measures to improve coal quality&#13;
25.       A  major environmental concem  is the steady decline (at about 2%  a year) of thermal coal quality.&#13;
Box 2.1.3 highlights the main causes of this decline in coal quality and proposes a number of remedial&#13;
steps.&#13;

Box 2.1.2 Coal India's program for strenghening of its environmental management capabilities&#13;
Cadre descriptions&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLANNERS. Planning a coal mine project involves inputs from various engineers and technical personnel&#13;
(geologists, mine planners, electrical and civil engineers, mine safety engineers environmental engineers, etc.). Environmental considerations&#13;
must be built into the planning process of a project. Experienced environmental, mining, civil and geological engineers have backgrounds that&#13;
will facilitate their training as environmental management planners. Coal India believes that executives with experience in coal mining will be&#13;
best suited for this job after training and exposure. Their primary responsibilities will be to ensure that project designs are 'environmentally&#13;
benign', integrate production and environmental management objectives and facilitate the intended reclamation goals. Training will be provided&#13;
at Coal India's facilities in Ranchi and on site.&#13;
POLLUTION CONTROL ENGINEERS. Without appropriate mitigating measures, mining operations can result in extensive air and water pollution.&#13;
Control measures for preventing and mitigating pollution of these two vital natural resources is required. These engineers can be drawn from&#13;
PHE, civil or environmental disciplines. Exposure, formal training and association with pollution control agencies will develop this cadre.&#13;
EXECUTIVE CHEMISTS. This executive will manage the environment laboratories being established in CMPDI's regional environmental cells.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING ENGINEERS. Their main task is to manage teams that carry out field sampling to inonitoring air, water and noise&#13;
standards. The engineers can be from any suitable engineering discipline, trained forthree months in environmental engineering courses suitable&#13;
for the coal industry and then can be deputed for this field sampling jobs.&#13;
RECLAMATION ECOLOGISTS. The reclamation of mine-out areas and overburden dumps need expertise and sustained efforts of dedicated&#13;
personnel. Scientists with backgrounds in botany, plantation, agriculture, forestry or ecology will be suited to carry out this exercise. These&#13;
scientists will be supported by landscaping engineers for designing suitable land uses.&#13;
SUPPORT STAFF. The environmental specialists mentioned above will need techincal and nontechnical support staff. The technical staff will&#13;
assist in planning, laboratory analysis, field sampling, plant nursery development, etc. Nontechnical staff will carry out assistance in the field,&#13;
laboratory and office.&#13;
CURRENT STAFFING LEVELS AND PROJECTED FIVE YEAR REQUIREMENTS. The tables on the following page summarize the current staffing levels&#13;
and projected staffing requirements for environmental cells. The executive staff grades referred to in the tables are as follows:&#13;
M3   Chief General Manager (E9)&#13;
M2   Chief Engineer (E8)/Chief Mining Engineer/Additional Chief&#13;
Ml   Deputy Chief Mining Engineer (E6)&#13;
E5    Superintending Engineer, Superintendent of Mines, etc.&#13;
E4    Senior Executive Engineer&#13;
E3    Assistant Engineer, Assistant Mine Manager, etc.&#13;
E2    Assistant Engineer, Mine Under Manager (graduate entry level)&#13;
El    Apprentice Engineer&#13;
Staff training and technical assistance&#13;
The build up oftechnical expertise foreffectivecompliance with environmental provisions requires training ofthe involved personnel. There&#13;
are four clear training facets leading to achievement of the objectives:&#13;
*     environmental planning to be integrated with the project report preparation,&#13;
*     execution of mitigational measures for controlling pollution,&#13;
*     monitoring and evaluation of planning and execution of the mitigational measures, and&#13;
*     modifying the planning and execution guidelines for better results, if required.&#13;
To make environmental personnel responsive, responsible and committed to environmental safeguards, training on these facets is required.&#13;
Both classroom training and on site training on demonstration projects with local and foreign experts will be provided. The framing of training&#13;
schemes and effective implementation is a specialised job for which consultants (from within and outside the country) will be engaged.&#13;
Programs for immediate training needs are:&#13;
*     environmental and social impact appreciation short-courses for senior management on environmental regulations, objec-&#13;
tives and standards, and management's responsibilities in the management of environmental and social impacts;&#13;
*     design, construction and operation of surface water control and treatment schemes for engineers at project/area levels;&#13;
*     design, construction and recontouring of overburden dump systems for stability and eventual reclamation;&#13;
*     Reclamation plant species selection and revegetation techniques;&#13;
*     effective design and operation of air and water quality and noise monitoring networks; and&#13;
*     environmental inspection and compliance auditing techniques.&#13;

Five-Year Plan of environmental facilities and equipment needs&#13;
Buildings andfacilities&#13;
OMCE ACCOMMODATIONS AND STORAGE BULDINGS. Office accommodation for cells from Coal India's corporate cell to subproject cells are&#13;
housed in the main offices ofthe units. No separate office is called forexcept perhaps at the project level. Provision is being made for construction&#13;
of a 300m2 office at each subproject. This is expected to required two years (i.e. 1996-99) to complete.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL LABORATORY FACILITIES. Coal India has decided that CMPDI will develop Laboratory facilities under their Regional Institute&#13;
to supply effective environmental monitoring to the subprojects. Five laboratories will be established, two in SECL and one each in MCL, WCL&#13;
and NCL. The environmental laboratories at Institute of Environmental (CMPDI- HQ) will cater to CCL and will render specialist services to&#13;
the five regional laboratories being set up in the Regional Institutes.&#13;
PLANT PROPAGATION AND NURSERY FACILITIES. Each area will develop a nursery facility for plant propagation. Generally, the sapplings are&#13;
purchased from State forest departments and large scale facilities are not required.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND LABORATORY ANALYSIS. The CMPDI regional laboratories to be opened for the four companies will be&#13;
provided with laboratory instruments and other infrastructure. This will be over and above the field kits to be used by area level cells in their&#13;
own areas for surprise and spot checks.&#13;
EARTH MOVING AND LAND RECLAMATION. The machinery or contractual expenses for land reclamation have been included in the 5 year EAPs&#13;
for subprojects.&#13;

Box 2.1.3 Improvement of coal quality&#13;
1. THE DECUNE IN THE QUALITY OF INDIAN THERMAL COAL. Coal India's main thrust has traditionally been towards the production of a higher&#13;
tonnage of coal, many times at the expense of quality. Indian thermal coal, in general, is of inherently low quality. Its structure contains finely&#13;
disseminated clays and shale which cannot be removed by low cost, gravity-basedwashing techniques. More expensive beneficiation techniques&#13;
are required to improve its quality. The boilers of Indian power stations, however, are specifically designed to bum Indian coals. The boilers&#13;
could operatr efficiently with low quality coal, only if its quality is consistent.&#13;
2. The siigle Indian criterion of thernal coal quality, its 'useful heat value (UHV),' is decreasing at the rate of about 2% per year. However,&#13;
the purpose of this annex is not to comment on the inherent quality of Indian coal, but to discuss ways of improving the quality of the product&#13;
delivered to powerstations. This would result in higher efficiency and availability, a reduced requirement forrail transport and reduced pollution.&#13;
3. The quality of Indian thermal coal is measured in terms of its 'useful heat value' in kcal/kg, claiming to be a relative index of the commercial&#13;
value in marketing coal, although it is not physically measured as such but is determined by applying the more easily analytically determined&#13;
ash and moisture content percentages to an empirical formula designed by the Central Fuel Research Institute in Dhanbad. This formula is taken&#13;
as representative of all Indian thermal coals regardless of theirarca of origin. The system has no parallel outside India and would not be accepted&#13;
by foreign power companies since it has no direct correlation to delivered heat.&#13;
4. PRICING sTRucruRE. The present pricing structure of Indian thermal coal is based on a series of steps from lower to higher quality; each step&#13;
spans a wide variation in the UHV of the coal. In the case of the more plentiful, lower quality coals, this can mean that a single price per ton&#13;
applies to coals with as much as a 10% variation in ash content. Careless handling and inclusion of extraneous matter in the product can often&#13;
be advantageous to a mine, since it can increase output tonnage without incurring a penalty on the price per ton. At the same time, the costs of&#13;
transporting the extraneous matter, handling it, crushing it, buming it, and disposing of the resultant ash are bome not by the mining companies,&#13;
but by the powergenerating companies since the coal is sold on an ex-mine basis. There is a strong practical case for the revision of the 'stepped'&#13;
nature of the pricing structure to a simple price gradient which would reward every effort expended towards production of higher and consistent&#13;
quality coal.&#13;
5. Presentpotential for beneficiationofcoaltransported more than500km is 80million tons peryear(which requires an investment ofUSS250&#13;
million. Based on 2% improvement in powerplant availability, about 19 million tons per year of C02 (andassociated pollution) can be reduced&#13;
from 300 million tons (the total present emissions from coal fired power plants in India). About 950 MW of power generation capacity can be&#13;
saved by improving plant availability. The value of the saved generation capacity is about US$ 1.1 billion. The merits to global warming, by&#13;
GEF criteria, would have the value of US$380 million ( pricing the reduced emissions at USS20/ton). By year 2010 the potential for coal&#13;
beneficiation could double alongside with all other benefits mentioned above.&#13;
6. INCLUSION OF EXTRANEOUS MATrER. The code of practice laid down by Coal India's technical subsidiary, CMPDI in Ranchi, requires non-&#13;
coal intercalationmorethan onemeterthick to be excavatedseparately anddisposedof in the backfilling of the mine. This means that, inpractice,&#13;
anything of a meter thickness or less is incorporated into the product sent to the power plant. In addition, the standard excavator, used in Coal&#13;
India's mines, is a traditional rope-operated shovel loading into trucks. The geometry of its operating action - a curving, upsweeping motion&#13;
- is not conducive to selective excavation. In most intemational opencast operations, hydraulic excavators are mandated for the excavation of&#13;
coal and rope operated shovels on overburden.&#13;
7. However, it is quite practical for Coal India to separate non-coal intercalation of 20cm or more, given the right equipment and an effective&#13;
incentive to do so. In contrast, in British Coal opencast mining, the separation and discard of any non-coal intercalation of 5cm or more is&#13;
mandated.&#13;
8. INAPPROPRIATE WORICIN PRACTicFs. A working practice which should be discontinued is the blasting of coal seams that contain significant&#13;
intercalation ofnon-coal matteracceptable by CMPDI's dimensional standards. Blasting effectively makes separation impossible since the non-&#13;
coal mnatter is mixed inextricably with the coal itself. Should the coal be too difficult to excavate without prior breaking-up, it should be broken&#13;
by bulldozers equipped with standard multi-tined rippers; equipment which Coal India's subsidiaries do not presently possess.&#13;
9. Two areas contributing additional extraneous matter to the product are at the top and bottom of the coal seam. In the former case, insufficient&#13;
attention is given to the careful cleaning off of the upper surface of the seam to remove material left by the overburden stripping excavators or&#13;
spilled by dump trucks. In the latter case, it is very easy, when using a rope operated shovel, to excavate into the material below the floor of the&#13;
coal seam and include that matter in the final product or to deliberately stop short of the floor and waste coal in the process.&#13;
10. INacN arr As long as any efforts by the coal industry towards a cleaner product are likely to go unrewarded, the present situation will&#13;
not change. There must be incentives or directives to implement changes in equipment and working practices to improve the overall product,&#13;
as well as financial penalties for not doing so. Remuneration should be based not so much on tonnage of a presently typical coal and dirt mixture,&#13;
but more on actual heat quantities transferred from the coal company to the power company. This would necessitate the abandonment of the&#13;
UHV system andrequire determination ofnetcalorific value (togetherwith proximate analysis) carried outon a frequentand regularbasis. Power&#13;

companies regularly purchasing large quantities of coal should have the right to inspect coal in-situ and refuse shipment of coal at the mine if&#13;
it can be seen to contain unacceptable levels of contaminants. Contracts between the companies should contain agreed payment rates, based&#13;
on measured gross calorific values of coal received on a monthly average basis, and penalties for excessive ash content.&#13;
11. Prior to implementation of recommended practices it will be necessary to carry out a detailed initial examination to determine a list of&#13;
appropriate equipment, specific to each mine, to be procured under the consecutive rehabilitation project. The practical implementation of an&#13;
improvement program will not be possible until the equipment is in place.&#13;
12. aENEFITs. The benefits of betterdelivered coal quality would accrue almost entirely to the customerat the present time. While this remains&#13;
the case, there are unlikely to be any efforts made by the coal producers to produce cleaner coal. The benefits to the generating companies are&#13;
substantial; less wear on crushing equipment, less material to handle, less ash to dispose of, less rail transport cost and greater boiler efficiency.&#13;
Pollution due to ash and its toxic constituents are severely reduced and less land is needed forash disposal. A formula which equitably distributes&#13;
the financial benefits of cleaner coal, in line with the landed price of imported coal, should be agreed and implemented, case by case, together&#13;
with appropriate penalties for quality below agreed target values.&#13;

Annex 2.2 COAL INDIA'S CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY&#13;
Preamble&#13;
1.   Coal mining has a pronounced impact on the environment. The im-&#13;
pacts may be positive or negative. The application of the impacts and&#13;
search for the measures depends on the quality and quantity of impacts&#13;
and hence assessment of impacts due to a project becomes a critical&#13;
activity in appraising a project for detailed planning and implementa-&#13;
tion.&#13;
2.   Coal mining started in 1774 in the Raniganj Coalfield. Slowly it&#13;
started to expand westward and reached the coalfields of Bihar. By&#13;
second world war, coal was already being mined in the States of Bengal,&#13;
Bihar, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Assam. During early&#13;
70's, coal industry was nationalised. Thereafter, it started expanding&#13;
at a fast rate to meet the requirement of power, steel and other sec-&#13;
tors. The major growth in coal production was achieved by opencast&#13;
mining method. This has a shorter gestation period and low winning&#13;
cost. However, it has more pronounced impacts on environment.&#13;
3.   The environmental considerations, specially in the coal mining&#13;
industry, started only from 80's. The appraisal of the projects from&#13;
environmental angle started from 1980-81, when a chapter on this sub-&#13;
ject was introduced in the project report. A committee called Environ-&#13;
mental Appraisal Committee (EAC) was constituted by the Central Govern-&#13;
ment to examine the environmental aspect of the project. The EAC slowly&#13;
added dimensions to the details required to be incorporated in the&#13;
environmental chapter. A separate questionnaire and check list were&#13;
also required to be submitted. In 1984, Government (Ministry of Envi-&#13;
ronment &amp; Forest) requested for a separate write-up to be submitted for&#13;
consideration of EAC. From 1987, this document, called Environmental&#13;
Management Plan (EMP), has taken shape. Today, it is an exhaustive&#13;
document covering all facets of Environment Impact Assessment (EIA)&#13;
with detailed cost estimates and implementation structure.&#13;
4.   Coal India Limited subscribes to the view of sustainable develop-&#13;
ment. Unless the environment can sustain all the developmental activi-&#13;
ties, any pursuit of development in isolation can cause irreparable&#13;
damage to the ecosystem and associated environmental attributes. There-&#13;
fore, there is need to lay down policy guidelines on this subject for&#13;
all the operating companies (Subsidiaries) of Coal India to work within&#13;
a framework of environmental Policy which will lead to sustainable&#13;
development.&#13;
Note: This is the original text of the policy statement regarding Coal India's Environmental Policy which&#13;
was issued in July 1995.&#13;

policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation of project affected persons.&#13;
Objective and strategies of Coal India's environmental policy&#13;
6.   The main corporate objective is to lay down guidelines for the&#13;
subsidiary companies so that they in turn can formulate strategies,&#13;
develop methodologies and generate Work Plans to match their activities&#13;
with the guiding principle of SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. This will in-&#13;
volve compliance with the environmental statutes, guidelines and in-&#13;
structions from legal agencies and carrying out activities in conso-&#13;
nance with provisions of EIA/EMP, clearance letters and consent let-&#13;
ters.&#13;
7.   One important objective is to ensure required organisational ca-&#13;
pacity build up at all levels to meet the challenges of environmental&#13;
compliance.&#13;
8.   Other objectives in fulfilling environmental goals are:&#13;
i    To fully integrate environmental impact assessment and envi-&#13;
ronmental impact management with mine planning ,design and&#13;
operation.&#13;
*    To mitigate the adverse environmental impacts of mining to&#13;
the maximum extent possible, so that the coal sector is&#13;
accepted as socially responsible.&#13;
*    To educate and train the environment personnel and arouse&#13;
awareness at all levels, in the operational/field personnel,&#13;
for achieving the environmental objectives.&#13;
9.   To achieve the above objectives, Coal India proposes the follow-&#13;
ing strategies:&#13;
All mine planning and design should be environmentally ac-&#13;
ceptable and development shall be carried out in such a way&#13;
as to facilitate the maintenance of acceptable environmental&#13;
standard of quality during mining and eventually reclamation&#13;
of the land for the end use stipulated in the Environment&#13;
Management Plan.&#13;
*    Reclamation of mined out areas will aim to achieve a post&#13;
mining condition consistent with the proposed terminal land&#13;
use.&#13;
*    Progressive reclamation will be carried out as soon as the&#13;
mined out areas become dormant. In case of dragline mining,&#13;
where no further dumping is stipulated, reclamation will be&#13;
concurrent so as to minimise the delay between mining and&#13;
productive post-mining land use.&#13;
*    Reclamation technology will be developed to suit Indian&#13;
ecological conditions.&#13;
In new mines, environmental management will be fully inte-&#13;
grated with mine design, planning and development. A compre-&#13;
&#13;

Annex2.2&#13;
Page 3 of7&#13;
hensive base line survey of environmental resources and&#13;
values will be undertaken to serve as a basis against which&#13;
the impacts will be measured and the success of environmen-&#13;
tal programme evaluated. The funds and equipment allotted&#13;
for environmental work will not be diverted to any other&#13;
work.&#13;
*    Over the next five years, priority areas of focus will be&#13;
the improvement of technical capability in reclamation, the&#13;
protection of air and water quality and development of&#13;
organisational capability.&#13;
*    The effect of mining on the hydrology of the area will be&#13;
monitored closely. If any adverse impact on the ground water&#13;
is noticed, immediate mitigatory measures will be taken. In&#13;
particular, the level of water in the nearby wells and its&#13;
quality will be regularly monitored.&#13;
*    The quality of mine water before it is discharged to the&#13;
natural drainage channels will be monitored. Necessary sedi-&#13;
mentation ponds and water treatment plants will be con-&#13;
structed to ensure that the water pumped out from the mines&#13;
complies with the relevant Indian Standards.&#13;
19. Coal India proposes to give annual awards for achieving excel-&#13;
lence in environmental programmes, paralleling the award programmes for&#13;
production and worker's safety. These awards will recognise the merit&#13;
in preparation and implementation of environmental management plan, in&#13;
land reclamation programme, in the protection of air and water quality.&#13;
The company's and the projects' compliance with the environmental laws&#13;
and EMP approvals will be added to the list of criteria, considered for&#13;
evaluating the overall performance of the company and individual&#13;
project officials.&#13;
Key areas requiring strengthening to achieve the objectives&#13;
Organisa ti on&#13;
11.  Coal India Limited intends to build environmental cells at all&#13;
decision making/operational levels in its structure. The six different&#13;
levels where the Cells will be built/strengthened are:&#13;
i.   CIL corporate level&#13;
ii. Subsidiary company HQ level&#13;
iii. Area level&#13;
iv. Unit/Colliery level&#13;
v.   CMPDI (HQ) level&#13;
vi. CMPDI Regional Institute level&#13;
The environmental cells will be built at each level and manpower needs,&#13;
functional activities and interdependent links for each shall be spelt&#13;
out so that a cohesive organisation is developed with commitment to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
Annex 2.2&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
achieve CIL's environmental objectives. Where available, appropriate&#13;
external assistance may be availed as an alternative to development of&#13;
in-house capability.&#13;
12. A separate environmental engineering cadre will be framed by Coal&#13;
India Limited. This will be to attract committed engineers from envi-&#13;
ronment and other disciplines like mining and civil engineering.&#13;
13. The organisation envisaged to be developed, as aforesaid, shall&#13;
be built up in a phased manner. The priority in developing the cells&#13;
will be given to units which have environmental clearance accorded by&#13;
MOEF. Second priority will be for units having EMP cleared by Company/&#13;
CIL boards. Cells at levels (i),(ii), (v) and (vi) exist. Finally cells&#13;
at (iii) and (iv) would be in place by 2001-2002. These shall be struc-&#13;
turally strengthened to undertake responsibilities for environmental&#13;
compliance.&#13;
Environmental Impact Assessment and mitigational measures&#13;
14.  Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Environment Management&#13;
Plan (EMP) for all mines, washeries, Central and Regional workshops and&#13;
other industrial units causing environmental pollution, shall be formu-&#13;
lated in a phased manner. This will be mandatory for all new projects.&#13;
For all reconstruction and modernisation projects also (covered under&#13;
the 1994 gazette notification), it will be mandatory. Existing projects&#13;
needing forestry clearance will also need the EIA/EMP. For other exist-&#13;
ing units also, EIA/EMP shall be formulated in a phased manner, over a&#13;
time frame consistent with overall priorities of the subsidiary compa-&#13;
nies. Until the EMP for the aforesaid projects are formulated, the&#13;
operations in these units shall be guided by the consent letters for&#13;
air and water, issued by the respective State Pollution Control Boards.&#13;
Implementations of EMPs&#13;
15. A half yearly report of the status of implementation of&#13;
mitigational measures shall be prepared by the concerned Area Cell for&#13;
each project cleared by the MOEF. This report shall be submitted by the&#13;
Company to the MOEF. Quarterly monitoring reports for air and water&#13;
quality and noise level for every project environmentally cleared by&#13;
MOEF, will be submitted by the Company (Hq) Cell to State Pollution&#13;
Control Boards. Annual environmental statements, required for each unit&#13;
for the concerned financial year shall be submitted by each unit to&#13;
concerned State Pollution Control Boards.&#13;
16. Action Plan with quarterly time frame, covering 3 years period&#13;
shall be prepared for implementing mitigational measures in each of the&#13;
units having an EMP. This shall be a rolling plan updated at the begin-&#13;
ning of each year. For units with no EMP, activity plan for each finan-&#13;
&#13;

with consent letters and statutory provisions.&#13;
Consul tation&#13;
17. Area Environmental cells will consult the project affected people&#13;
and local NGOs on environment matters while preparing the action plans&#13;
as mentioned in para 16.&#13;
Coal washeries&#13;
The coal washeries involve lot of process water and disposal of solid&#13;
wastes after cleaning of raw coal. To mitigate the above adverse envi-&#13;
ronmental impacts, following policies are proposed:&#13;
18.  LIQUID EFFLUENTS: To minimise effects of liquid effluents, washeries&#13;
shall be operated on closed water circuit system. The water shall be&#13;
clarified / cleaned and recirculated. The process water shall not be&#13;
discharged to natural drainage without proper treatment to meet the&#13;
legal standards.&#13;
19.  SOLID WASTE: The slurry management system in all washeries shall be&#13;
organised to ensure collection of fines. The fines shall be regularly&#13;
sold / disposed-off to avoid its flow into the natural drainage chan-&#13;
nels during the rains. The rejects produced shall be used for power&#13;
generation in fluidised bed combustion (FBC) plants, sold to brick&#13;
manufacturers or used as land or mine fills. Lastly, the left out re-&#13;
ject dumps shall be suitably treated for bio- reclamation.&#13;
Mine fires&#13;
20. Annual Action Plan (AAP) for fire control projects/unit mine&#13;
fires shall be prepared to control and then extinguish the mine fires.&#13;
A nodal officer at company HQ level shall be nominated to prepare the&#13;
AAP in consultation with area/mines and expert agencies like the Direc-&#13;
torate General of Mines Safety (DGMS). A monthly report shall be sub-&#13;
mitted to CMD of the subsidiary and a quarterly report to company board&#13;
for their information and directions for further actions.&#13;
Mined land reclamation&#13;
21. As a policy, Coal India is committed to minimising the needs of&#13;
forest land/agriculture land and maximising backfilling to reclaim&#13;
mined out areas. These considerations will be integrated with mine&#13;
planning as already discussed. An annual operational plan will be pre-&#13;
pared for each Opencast mine, with production exceeding 2 million&#13;
tonnes per annum. This plan will be used to set right the deviations in&#13;
sequence of mining, backfilling, external dumping and reclamation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 2.2&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
22. Slopes of external dumps are an important area to be considered&#13;
for proper and effective reclamation. The slopes of external dumps are&#13;
to be suitably graded/terraced for plantation. Scientific studies shall&#13;
be undertaken for this purpose, wherever required.&#13;
23. Top Soil is recognised as invaluable natural resource specially&#13;
for regeneration of regional ecology. The EMP prepared shall give due&#13;
consideration for its suitable use for regeneration of ecology. For&#13;
effective bio-reclamation of disturbed land, scientific studies will be&#13;
carried out to select suitable species for each coalfield and sustain-&#13;
able sequence of reclamation from grass to shrubs, to trees.&#13;
Coal quality&#13;
24. Coal India recognises the fly ash disposal problem in the country&#13;
and would take the following actions to assist the power utilities in&#13;
their ash management:&#13;
-    Removal of extraneous mineral matters at the pit head&#13;
-    Beneficiation of ROM coal for power plants located farther&#13;
than 750 Km from the mine, if   they are prepared to bear&#13;
the cost, in addition&#13;
*    Assist pit head power plants in a study of the feasibility&#13;
of ash disposal in mined-out area.&#13;
Environmental training &amp; education&#13;
25. Courses on Environmental Protection Measures shall be organised&#13;
for project executives, at Company HQ, CIL Staff College or the Indian&#13;
Institute for Coal management (IICM) or at other institutes imparting&#13;
such training.&#13;
26. All Project Officers of mines/washeries, Staff Officers, General&#13;
Managers shall be exposed to courses on Environmental Protection Mea-&#13;
sures in a phased manner.&#13;
27. Environment week shall be celebrated and organised for all units&#13;
/ projects once every year on the pattern of Mines Safety Week. This is&#13;
to arouse awareness amongst field personnel. This will also promote the&#13;
importance of environment in the employees and inculcate a sense of&#13;
social responsibility for environmental protection.&#13;
Environmental research and development&#13;
28. An Institute of Environment has been set-up at Ranchi under&#13;
CMPDI. One of the main functions of this Institute is to carry out and/&#13;
or organise research and development in the field of environment for&#13;
coal mines and related areas.&#13;
&#13;

29.  Following areas are identified for R&amp;D studies at the first in-&#13;
stance:&#13;
i.   Suppression and treatment of dust on the haul roads.&#13;
ii.  Selection of suitable species for plantation on the OB&#13;
dumps.&#13;
iii. Settlement of solids from the washery effluents.&#13;
iv.  Control of dust at the Blast Hole Drills and the crusher&#13;
house in the CHPs of opencast projects.&#13;
v.    Stability and vegetation of dump slopes.&#13;
vi.  Mitigation of impacts on water table due to mining.&#13;
vii. Mitigation of vibrational impacts on local habitats due to&#13;
blasting.&#13;
Funding the environmental activities&#13;
30.  For projects having approved EMPs, the amount for the environmen-&#13;
tal activities is covered under capital &amp; revenue provisions made in&#13;
its project report. For other units, provision of 2.50% of the produc-&#13;
tion cost shall be kept in the revenue budget. The fund earmarked shall&#13;
be spent exclusively on environmental measures. For capital funding,&#13;
marginal schemes shall be prepared for each unit or each area to cover&#13;
the requisite capital expenses.&#13;
31.  There is appreciable backlog of land reclamation, specially in&#13;
older coalfields like Raniganj, Jharia and Bokaro. A part of the back-&#13;
log is inherited from private days. The effort needed to make up this&#13;
backlog is colossal. Coal India intends to spend 0.5% of its annual&#13;
turnover in reclaiming the old backlogs of land degradation. The total&#13;
reclamation period may span over nearly a decade.&#13;
Environmental cost code&#13;
32.  Till now, there is no separate cost code for expenditure on envi-&#13;
ronmental protection measures. As a policy, the cost code for environ-&#13;
ment will be put in place, for generation of data on expenses incurred&#13;
for environmental safeguards. This will help to monitor cost effective-&#13;
ness of environmental control measures being applied.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
33.  The purpose of framing this policy and guidelines on different&#13;
facets of environment is to permeate this thought down to the lowest&#13;
level. These guidelines shall bring uniformity in planning, execution&#13;
and monitoring systems for ensuring environmentally sustainable mining&#13;
activities. Enclosed annexure summarises the potential environmental&#13;
effects caused by mining activities and suggested policy approach.&#13;

Annex 2.3 RESETTLEMENT, REHABILITATION AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT&#13;
1.    Because coal mining and associated power developments have generally been sited in remote rural&#13;
areas, the period of rapid expansion associated with the opening of coal mines has brought about some&#13;
fundamental changes, both positive and negative, to the lifestyles of local people, many of whom had lived&#13;
at subsistence level, are poorly educated, and are from traditional cultures. Resettlement projects fall&#13;
generally into two categories: voluntary and involuntary. Voluntary resettlement usually involves younger&#13;
people - natural risk-takers seeking new opportunities - who have made the decision to move on their own.&#13;
By contrast, involuntary resettlement usually expropriates the rights of people who may not want to move,&#13;
and involves whole communities of individuals who previously lived in interdependence: young and old,&#13;
healthy and sick, affluent and poor, landholders and landless, skilled and unskilled. Since compensation&#13;
has usually been tied to loss of land rather than loss of livelihood, displacement divides the community.&#13;
Often, with the break-up of the community, the wealthier and more highly-skilled move to pursue opportu-&#13;
nities elsewhere, leaving behind a disproportionately poorer community with limited ability to adapt to&#13;
changing circumstances. In addition, increasing industrial activity typically attracts immigrants. Disadvan-&#13;
taged local people often either end up as exploited contract laborers trapped in perpetual poverty or they&#13;
simply leave the area - only to reappear in the slums of the city or as squatters encroaching on unoccupied&#13;
lands (often forest areas) in other parts of the region. The intrusion of industrial activity into traditional,&#13;
rural communities and the resulting adverse social impacts occur in nearly every country and no country&#13;
has yet dealt with them well. Therefore, there are no successful models of displacement and resettlement&#13;
that can guide the coal industry and the thermal power sector in their local rehabilitation programs.&#13;
2.    Coal production, whether it takes places in underground or opencast mines, requires access to&#13;
land. Unlike other industries, the coal industry has little choice in the location of its activities because coal&#13;
mines have to be developed where there are commercial reserves. In recent years, the social and environ-&#13;
mental costs of developing coal resources have increased considerably, particularly in the densely popu-&#13;
lated areas of India's eastern States. Coal India finds it increasingly difficult to acquire land for the expan-&#13;
sion of its operations. To deal with these challenges Coal India has changed the designs of new mines to&#13;
minimize the adverse effects of these operations on the environment; it has adopted resettlement and&#13;
rehabilitation policies that ensure that all people affected by its projects are compensated for their losses; it&#13;
has intensified the community development programs through which it aims to improve the living condi-&#13;
tions in villages adjacent to its mining operations; and it is strengthening the organizational structure&#13;
within the coal companies to ensure effective implementation of these policies.&#13;
Social implications&#13;
3.    Coal mining has had a profound impact on communities living in areas where mines were estab-&#13;
lished. Many of these areas, particularly in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Bihar, were rela-&#13;
tively isolated from industrial development and often had a tribal population with little contact with&#13;
outside society. The establishment of coal mines brought rapid modem industrial development to the area,&#13;
displaced people, offered employment and gave a new socio-economic profile to the area. These changes&#13;
include:&#13;
0   EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. The opening of a coal mine brings employment into an area.&#13;
The relatively high wages of the coal industry (Rs45,000 a year, equivalent to US$1,33 1) are&#13;
far above the prevailing minimum wage (Rs6,600 a year, equivalent to US$195) and make&#13;
employment in the coal industry highly attractive. In almost all instances offers of employ-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

ment remain the key to land acquisition and are the primary form of rehabilitation for&#13;
landowners. This makes it virtually impossible for the coal industry to transfer surplus labor&#13;
from other mines; not only would the local population resist, it would rob the coal company&#13;
of its most valuable bargaining chip in its efforts to acquire the necessary land. Construction&#13;
activities at the mine and the increase in purchasing power of those that find employment&#13;
with the coal company create numerous indirect employment opportunities. Since opportuni-&#13;
ties for employment in the mine are greater for men, the role of women changes drastically&#13;
from shared work and responsibilities to responsibility for domestic affairs and meeting&#13;
basic needs of the family. The local male population is often employed as unskilled labor.&#13;
*   IN-MIGRATION. Numerous outsiders in-migrate to the area (officers and skilled laborers of&#13;
Coal India, contractors, workers and businesses to serve these groups).&#13;
*   HEALTH CARE. Employees of the coal company enjoy some of the best health care available in&#13;
India. In emergencies, coal companies make their facilities available to local people not&#13;
employed by them. In addition, coal companies construct 'dispensaries' at resettlement sites,&#13;
as part of the rehabilitation package for project-affected people. (State Governments are to&#13;
provide the necessary staff. However, in practice States frequently fail to do this.) As part of&#13;
the community development program, coal companies frequently construct dispensaries and&#13;
clinics in the surrounding villages, even if they are not directly affected by their operations.&#13;
*   EDUCATION. Besides providing educational facilities in the employees' colonies, schools are&#13;
also provided as part of the rehabilitation package to project-affected people. However, State&#13;
Governments are responsible for providing teachers, which they frequently fail to do.&#13;
*   ROADS, POWER, WATER, ELECTRICITY, ETC. The coal companies provide these facilities, not&#13;
only to their employees, but also to project-affected people at resettlement sites.&#13;
*   CHANGE IN TRADITIONAL LIFESTYLES. The most significant change that occurs as a result of the&#13;
construction of a coal mine is the change in traditional lifestyles. The construction of a coal&#13;
mine inevitably introduces an element of modem lifestyle (characterized by salaried labor, a&#13;
money economy and a split between production and consumption) into a subsistance&#13;
economy, largely based on agriculture. This transition can be extremely painful and intro-&#13;
duce new elements for conflicts into local communities. The disparity of monetary incomes&#13;
created by the employment provided by the coal industry can be perceived as creating new&#13;
inequalities and giving rise to dissatisfaction among those who have not found employment.&#13;
The change in lifestyles is significant where it affects people, such as tribals, who had&#13;
depended on forest for their livelihood and had little contact with the 'outside world.' While&#13;
the interests of tribals are protected by special laws, the loss of key resources, such as forest&#13;
access, may result in impoverishment, loss of identity linked to a specific lifestyle and the&#13;
disintegration of communities. Furthermore, the sudden influx of money tends to create&#13;
inflationary pressures in the local economy. This especially affects those who are on the&#13;
margin of the money economy, i.e. those who continue to pursue their traditional livelihood.&#13;
4.     Many social groups live and interact in mine areas. The original communities may be at a disad-&#13;
vantage in this induced development and may have difficulties getting a share in the benefits of the&#13;
development process. In order to address the social impacts outlined above, Coal India has adopted two&#13;
groundbreaking corporate policies: the Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy which addresses the direct&#13;
and severe impact of land acquisition (Annex 2.4) and the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan which&#13;
outlines assistance that Coal India will provide to affected local communities near the mines (Annex 2.5).&#13;

Coal India's resettlement and rehabilitation policy&#13;
Evolution of Coal India 's policy for resettlement and rehabilitation&#13;
5.     Before considering the present status of resettlement and rehabilitation activities within Coal&#13;
India, it is essential to appreciate the timescale and duration of mining projects and to recognize that many&#13;
existing mines were designed and put into operation several decades ago. Since then there have been many&#13;
progressive changes in the application of resettlement and rehabilitation in India and within the mining&#13;
sector. So the situation seen at an old mine should not be taken as representative of Coal India's current&#13;
approach to resettlement and rehabilitation.&#13;
6.     Standards and approaches have also changed because of the nature of projects, regional differ-&#13;
ences in policies and their implementation and variations in the approaches and applications taken by&#13;
project personnel. Because of the great number of opencast mines which have developed over the past 30&#13;
years, the current situation of resettlement and rehabilitation of project-affected people has become quite&#13;
complex. To appreciate the current situation, the timing of the resettlement and rehabilitation activity and&#13;
the situation at the time of project implementation must be taken into account.&#13;
7.     Coal India's decision to establish a policy for resettlement and rehabilitation of project-affected&#13;
people represents an effort to provide uniform guidance to subsidiary coal companies in response to the&#13;
persistent and growing discontent of project-affected people in many locations. The evolution of this&#13;
policy has been influenced by several factors. The driving motive has been the continuous and growing&#13;
need for land. Until the late 1980s, the coal companies dealt mainly with the landowners, and ensured their&#13;
cooperation by providing employment to families of landholders of a certain size (usually more than two&#13;
acres) in addition to paying the compensation for lost assets. With the increased mechanization of the coal&#13;
mines, the increase of population with smaller land holdings and increased political attention to involun-&#13;
tary displacement, it has become increasingly difficult for the coal companies to continue this practice.&#13;
While the demand for jobs in the coal companies for surrendering land has increased, the need for un-&#13;
skilled labor has declined with the increasing mechanization of mining operations. All coal companies&#13;
employ more labor than they need.&#13;
Efforts by States to shape resettlement and rehabilitation&#13;
8.     The State Governments of Madhya Pradesh and Orissa have responded to this situation by issuing&#13;
guidelines for rehabilitation measures, largely based on the size of the land expropriated. These are&#13;
formulated as entitlements for jobs in the coal company for the families of the titleholders. Although first&#13;
priority is given to those families losing both homestead and one third of agricultural land, the provisions&#13;
generally favor larger landowners by providing employment for one person coming from families losing&#13;
two or more acres of irrigated land or three or more acres of unirrigated land. The aim of these policies&#13;
seems to be based on the State Governments' wish to secure employment in the region.&#13;
Coal India 's Gulla Package&#13;
9.    In 1990 a circular (the so-called Gulla package) was given to all subsidiaries by Mr. O.P. Gulla,&#13;
Joint Secretary to the Government of India, Department of Coal, Ministry of Energy. This document was&#13;
the first attempt to formulate a corporate policy for resettlement and rehabilitation in Coal India and&#13;
provided the basis for resettlement and rehabilitation activities up to April, 1994. The circular stipulates&#13;
the following responsibilities for the coal company:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 4 of 9&#13;
a)   All new employment opportunities for unskilled and semiskilled labor must go to land&#13;
losers.&#13;
b)  Vocational training should be provided to upgrade project-affected peoples' skills for&#13;
employment in the coal company.&#13;
c)   Cash compensation for land must be deposited by the coal company to the District Authori-&#13;
ties before taking possession in order to avoid delays in payment.&#13;
d)  A monthly allowance for 20 years, depending of the size of the lost land holding, should be&#13;
paid to the titleholder who did not get a job in the coal company.&#13;
10.    In addition to the provisions made in the Gulla Package, coal companies continued to follow the&#13;
State guidelines of providing employment for one person from each family which lost two or more acres&#13;
of irrigated land or three or more acres of unirrigated land.&#13;
11.    The provision of jobs is regarded by almost all project-affected people as the most desirable&#13;
rehabilitation option, since it results in an almost seven-fold increase in income for most (para. 3 above).&#13;
In addition, employment in the coal mine brings additional benefits, such as free medical care and subsi-&#13;
dized housing. With the phasing out of Government support, Coal India can no longer afford the heavy&#13;
financial cost of employing more labor than it needs. Therefore, Coal India has imposed severe restrictions&#13;
on the hiring of new staff and, in parallel, adopted programs to reduce its manpower. This situation forced&#13;
Coal India to rethink its policy of rehabilitating project-affected people. Since the provision of jobs cannot&#13;
be taken for granted in the future, the coal companies have had to find other ways to restore the incomes of&#13;
people who are adversely affected by the acquisition of land.&#13;
12.    It has long been recognized by the coal companies that not all the people that live in communities&#13;
occupying or using land required by the mine are land owners. This group may include tenant farmers,&#13;
sharecroppers, squatters and agricultural laborers. Until Coal India's new resettlement and rehabilitation&#13;
policy, these people have not been entitled to any resettlement and rehabilitation assistance. However,&#13;
when resettling a village, the subsidiaries have often provided accommodation for some of these families&#13;
at the resettlement site.&#13;
13.    The salient features of the State guidelines, the Gulla package, and the new Coal India policy are&#13;
summarized in Box 2.3.1. Coal India's current policy (Annex 2.4) was approved by the Board on April 4,&#13;
1994. It represents the latest stage in a development brought about by the increased challenges confronting&#13;
the coal companies when acquiring land. The development is characterized by several trends:&#13;
*   from recognizing only the loss of land in the compensation process to considering the loss of&#13;
economic assets,&#13;
*   from considering only landowners/titleholders to be dealt with to considering the surround-&#13;
ing communities as the partner in the resettlement and rehabilitation process,&#13;
*   from considering landowning families as the unit of entitlement to considering every adult&#13;
individual as the unit of entitlement,&#13;
*   from acting on the basis of regional guidelines to acting of the basis of a corporate policy,&#13;
*   from provision of employment with the coal company as the major vehicle of rehabilitation&#13;
to multiple rehabilitation efforts,&#13;
*   from being mainly accountable to the coal company to being primarily accountable to the&#13;
project-affected people, and&#13;
*   from not involving the project-affected people in the planning and implementation to exten-&#13;
sive consultation and participation of project-affected people in the process.&#13;

Tribal issues&#13;
14.    The official classification of social and/or ethnic groups and the land where they reside rests on&#13;
principles established in 1890, which have not been changed substantially since. This means that what is&#13;
classified as forest area may have been converted into farming land; and that tribal groups, originally&#13;
living a migratory life, may have changed their way of living into a sedentary, agricultural lifestyle.&#13;
15.    With the exception of one mine (Jhingurdah), all the tribal project-affected population are settled&#13;
in mixed villages, among caste Hindus and scheduled caste Hindus. They are predominantly engaged in&#13;
agriculture on fixed plots (as opposed to slash and bum cultivation) or crafts related to agriculture (black-&#13;
smith, carpentry, etc.). As described in several of the baseline studies, several of the tribal groups have a&#13;
special affinity to the local environment, such as forest and hills, and use these in their daily lives, al-&#13;
though this affinity to the local environment is often shared with other groups in the village. All the tribals&#13;
speak the local dialect of Hindi (except in Orissa, where they all speak Oriya, the majority language).&#13;
&#13;

16.    Most of the tribal population is integrated into the Indian rural society and has been exposed to&#13;
mining operations for the past 15-30 years. Their contact to the 'outside world' is not new and does not&#13;
constitute a threat to the survival of their identity. In places like Madhya Pradesh, tribals constitute the&#13;
majority of the local workforce in coal mines and have done so for more than 20 years. The Jhingurdah&#13;
mine started operating in 1965 and approximately 40% of the project-affected families have persons&#13;
already employed by NCL.&#13;
Laws and policies regarding scheduled tribes&#13;
17.    NATIONAL LAWS AND POLICIES. Scheduled tribes are one of the weaker sections of the Indian popu-&#13;
lation. The Constitution of India provides a framework for the socio-economic development of scheduled&#13;
tribes and prevention of their exploitation by other groups. In the Directive Principles of State Policy,&#13;
Article 46 directs the state to "promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the&#13;
weaker sections of the people and in particular, of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and shall&#13;
protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation". In Article 41, the state is required to&#13;
make effective provisions "for securing the right to work, to education and to public assistance in cases of&#13;
unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement, and in cases of undeserved want." The Fundamental&#13;
Rights of the Constitution are applicable to all Indian people, and ensure equality before the law (Article&#13;
14); prohibit the state from discriminating on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth&#13;
(Article 15); ensure equal opportunity for public employment (Article 16); abolish 'untouchability;' ensure&#13;
freedom of speech and movement; etc.&#13;
18.    Both the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles of State Policy apply to all peoples of&#13;
India. However, the Constitution also provides specific provisions to protect weaker sections of the&#13;
population from exploitation and ensure that they have access to educational and employment opportuni-&#13;
ties. Article 342 deals with a mechanism of scheduling tribes by the President of India in consultation with&#13;
the Governor of the State. The scheduling is done state-wise and tribes that are scheduled in one state may&#13;
not be in another.&#13;
19.    Scheduling in Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra comes under the Fifth Schedule&#13;
which provides for:&#13;
*   An annual report to be presented by the Governor of the State to the President of India&#13;
regarding the administration of scheduled areas in that state;&#13;
*   The right of the Union Government to give directions to States as to the administration of the&#13;
area;&#13;
*   The establishment of a Tribes Advisory Council at the state level to advise on matters such&#13;
as the welfare and advancement of the scheduled tribes;&#13;
*   The right of the Governor to direct that any Act of Parliament or of the State Legislature may&#13;
not apply to the scheduled area or could apply with modifications;&#13;
*   Regulations to prohibit or restrict the transfer of land by or among members of scheduled&#13;
tribes in the area; and&#13;
*   Regulations to regulate money lenders to scheduled tribes.&#13;
20.    Article 275 provides for grants to be made to States by the Union Government to enable them to&#13;
meet the cost of government-approved schemes to promote the welfare of scheduled tribes or to raise the&#13;
level of administration of scheduled areas in the State. Other articles provide for reservation of seats in the&#13;
House of the People, the legislative assemblies of the States and local elected bodies (Panchayat) and&#13;
make a special provision for a Minister in charge of Tribal Welfare in Bihar, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh.&#13;

21.   STATE LEVEL LEGISLATION. The states of Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Bihar have all&#13;
enacted similar legislation following the Fifth Schedule. In addition, several have legislation regarding&#13;
local issues. Below is a description of legislation pertaining to tribals in Orissa, which serves as an illustra-&#13;
tion of the state legislation in all four states:&#13;
22.    Under the powers vested under the Fifth Schedule the following regulations have been promul-&#13;
gated in the State of Orissa:&#13;
THE ORISSA SCHEDULED AREAS TRANSFER OF IMMOVABLE PROPERTY (BY SCHEDULED TRIBES)&#13;
REGULATION, 1956, AS AMENDED IN 1993 prohibits alienation of tribal land to non-scheduled&#13;
tribes, unless permitted in writing by competent authority. Illegal alienation and unautho-&#13;
rized occupied tribal land shall be restored to the tribal owners. The competent authority,&#13;
now vested with the Tahsildar, has been authorized to initiate proceedings sui moto or on&#13;
application by any interested party and to evict unauthorized persons occupying tribal land.&#13;
In addition, Officers on Special Duty (Land Reforms) have been posted exclusively for&#13;
disposal of such land alienation cases.&#13;
*   THE ORISSA SCHEDULED AREAS MONEY LENDER'S REGULATION, 1967 controls and regulates&#13;
money lending operations in scheduled areas.&#13;
23.    Besides these two regulations specifically enacted by the Tribes Advisory Council, the following&#13;
Acts of Orissa have been made operative in scheduled areas:&#13;
*   THE ORISSA DEBT RELIEF ACT, 1980 provides relief to scheduled tribe debtors by making the&#13;
loans contracted by small farmers, rural artisans and agricultural laborers prior to the com-&#13;
mencement of the Act as deemed to have been wholly discharged.&#13;
*   THE BONDED LABOR SYSTEM ABOLITION ACT, 1976 aims at liberating and rehabilitating bonded&#13;
laborers among the scheduled tribes.&#13;
*   THE ORISSA LAND REFORMS ACT, 1960 protects the scheduled tribe population living outside of&#13;
scheduled areas from land alienation.&#13;
*   THE ORISSA RESERVATION OF VACANCIES IN POSTS AND SERVICES (FOR SCHEDULED CASTE AND&#13;
SCHEDULED TRIBE ACT, 1975 makes provision for the reservation of posts for scheduled castes&#13;
(16.25%) and scheduled tribes (22.50%) for initial appointments and promotions in State&#13;
Government and other authorities under their control. The Act also reserves one third of the&#13;
posts in Classes II, III and IV for women from these scheduled categories.&#13;
24.    Coal India has a history of providing relatively high standards of living for its employees. Not&#13;
only are salaries competitive, but security in employment is high and means access to staff quarters with&#13;
electricity, water supply and well functioning educational and health facilities. While this may not directly&#13;
affect the surrounding communities of people not employed in the mine, it may introduce a relative&#13;
depravation for those not having access to the facilities. In its efforts to develop Coal India as a modern&#13;
efficient operation run by socially responsible organizations, Coal India has adopted a framework stipulat-&#13;
ing the scope within which Coal India will assist the communities of the surrounding habitations to&#13;
minimize this process of differential access: Coal India's community development policy or General&#13;
Indigenous Peoples Development Plan. The Plan is included as Annex 2.5.&#13;
25.   In light of the fact that most tribals in coal mining areas live in 'mixed villages,' that is in close&#13;
proximity with other communities, Coal India proposed to meet the requirements of the Bank's Opera-&#13;
tional Directive 4.20 through the implementation of community development in the surrounding commu-&#13;
nities. This has two advantages. One is that a separate development plan, exclusively for tribals, would be&#13;
divisive in the present social context of the mine areas. By addressing the needs of tribals through devel-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 9 of 9&#13;
opment efforts aimed at the community as a whole, it will be easier to protect their special interests and&#13;
meet their needs. However, Coal India realizes that tribals may be at a disadvantage in accessing the&#13;
benefits brought about by the implementation of these community development prograns. The policy&#13;
therefore gives special priority to tribals and women, and the mine specific Indigenous Peoples Develop-&#13;
ment Plans were prepared with this in mind. In the process, separate meetings were held with tribal&#13;
communities and women's groups to elicit their needs, which were subsequently given highest priority in&#13;
the plans. A prioritization of habitations surrounding the mines was done according to the proportion of&#13;
scheduled tribal population. The fund allocation for activities among habitations within a mine area was&#13;
based on this. In addition. the mechanisms and committees designed for ongoing participation ensures that&#13;
tribal communities are represented. The second advantage is that Coal India already has a program of&#13;
community development assistance, which has not been well articulated, remained at the full discretion of&#13;
mine managers, and was not transparent to the concemed communities. Therefore this revision created an&#13;
opportunity for firmning up the guidelines for better utilization of funds and correcting the above mentioned&#13;
weaknesses.&#13;

Annex 2.4 RESETTLEMENT AND REHABILITATION POLICY OF COAL INDIA&#13;
Preanble&#13;
1.   The location and quality of coal reserves, and their distance&#13;
from major consumers determine to a great extent the selection of mine&#13;
sites. For reserves that are close to the surface, opencast mining has&#13;
proven to be the most efficient mining method. While relatively inex-&#13;
pensive, opencast mines require large areas of land. Population growth,&#13;
particularly in India's eastern region, make it increasingly difficult&#13;
for the subsidiary coal companies (subsidiaries) to acquire the land&#13;
they need for expanding their operations.&#13;
2.   In the past, subsidiaries found it relatively easy to acquire&#13;
land, if they were able to offer jobs. Partly because of this practice,&#13;
subsidiaries have built up their labour force beyond their needs. This&#13;
has contributed to the heavy losses many mines incur and eroded the&#13;
competitiveness of the coal industry. The subsidiaries may still need&#13;
to hire people in selected locations and continue to give preference to&#13;
those whose livelihood will be affected by coal mining operations.&#13;
However, increasingly subsidiaries will need to develop other ways and&#13;
means to compensate land owners and others adversely affected by their&#13;
projects. Only proper resettlement and rehabilitation will elicit the&#13;
cooperation of project affected people, and make it possible for Coal&#13;
India to acquire the land it needs.&#13;
3.   The purpose of this statement is to set out the basic principles&#13;
for the resettlement and rehabilitation of people affected by coal&#13;
mining projects (PAPs). As such, this statement attempts to streamline&#13;
the different resettlement and rehabilitation practices being followed&#13;
by subsidiaries and to modify them in a way that allows subsidiaries to&#13;
deal more effectively with resettlement and rehabilitation issues.&#13;
4.   While Coal India's basic philosophy for compensating land-losers&#13;
and other project-affected people remains substantially unchanged, the&#13;
statement emphasizes the need to cultivate and maintain good relation-&#13;
ships with the people affected by Coal India's projects starting as&#13;
early as possible; it also underscores that the subsidiaries have a&#13;
responsibility towards the landless, whose livelihood is often taken&#13;
away. On the other hand, subsidiaries need to protect themselves more&#13;
effectively against unjustified claims. To this end, the statement&#13;
proposes that subsidiaries prepare detailed resettlement and rehabili-&#13;
tation action plans (RAPs) that clearly identify, at an early stage,&#13;
the entitlements of the people affected by coal projects.&#13;
Note: This is the original text of the policy statement regarding Coal India's resettlement and rehabilita-&#13;
tion policy which was issued in April 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 2.4&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
5.   The resettlement and rehabilitation policies followed by the sub-&#13;
sidiaries have evolved over time and undergone numerous changes in&#13;
response to changing circumstances. As and when the Central or State&#13;
Governments issue new guidelines for resettlement and rehabilitation,&#13;
Coal India will review and modify its resettlement and rehabilitation&#13;
policy taking into account the changing conditions in coal producing&#13;
areas. However, as a matter of principle, the compensation and benefits&#13;
offered to the people affected by coal projects of Coal India will be&#13;
at least equal to and not less than those prescribed by the laws and&#13;
guidelines of the Central and State Governments. However, in any case&#13;
Coal India's resettlement and rehabilitation policy has to be approved&#13;
by the Ministry of Coal.&#13;
Objective of Coal India's resettlement and rehabilitation policy&#13;
6.   In light of the growing difficulties many subsidiaries face in&#13;
land acquisition highest priority will be given to avoiding or minimiz-&#13;
ing disturbance of the local population. In their decisions to open new&#13;
mines or expand existing ones, subsidiaries will explore alternative&#13;
sites and project designs in order to minimize the need for resettle-&#13;
ment. Wherever people are likely to be adversely affected by a project,&#13;
the subsidiaries will prepare resettlement and rehabilitation action&#13;
plans for the project.&#13;
7.   Through the preparation of resettlement and rehabilitation action&#13;
plans subsidiaries will safeguard that project-affected people improve,&#13;
or at least regain, their former standard of living and earning capac-&#13;
ity after a reasonable transition period. The transition period is to&#13;
be kept to a minimum. However, the involvement of subsidiaries in re-&#13;
settlement and rehabilitation activities will continue until all the&#13;
actions specified in the rehabilitation plan have been completed.&#13;
8.   Involuntary resettlement is conceived and executed as a develop-&#13;
ment programme with project-affected people being provided sufficient&#13;
resources and opportunities to share in a project's benefits. The ef-&#13;
forts of subsidiaries are complementary to government schemes in rural&#13;
development. To the extent that this is necessary, the concurrence,&#13;
approvals and support from concerned Government authorities will be&#13;
sought. In parallel, subsidiaries will work closely with&#13;
non-governmental organizations, which are legally recognized and con-&#13;
stituted and also have the confidence of the project-affected people,&#13;
in the preparation and implementation of rehabilitation plans.&#13;
Definition of project-affected persons (PAPs)&#13;
9.   Coal India recognizes that the acquisition of land in populated&#13;
areas for mining purposes greatly affects the lives and livelihood of&#13;
the local population. While the development of new mines brings along&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-61-&#13;
Annex 2.4&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
job opportunities with the subsidiaries, associated contractors and&#13;
ancillary industries, it also eliminates many traditional sources of&#13;
income. The rehabilitation efforts of the subsidiaries are designed to&#13;
integrate the various groups of people affected by the project into the&#13;
regional development process. The development of a new mine or expan-&#13;
sion of mining activities tends to accelerate this process. By inform-&#13;
ing the potentially affected people, at the earliest possible stage,&#13;
about the project and options for resettlement and rehabilitation,&#13;
subsidiaries prepare the local population for the changes that are to&#13;
come and ease the transition to new lifestyles.&#13;
10.  It is Coal India's policy to recognize adult individuals as the&#13;
unit of entitlement. In their rehabilitation efforts subsidiaries deal&#13;
with a wide range of project-affected people. They fall into the fol-&#13;
lowing categories:&#13;
A. Land owners, including those with whom government land is&#13;
settled:&#13;
i)   Persons from whom land is acquired including tribals&#13;
cultivating land under traditional rights;&#13;
ii) persons whose homestead is acquired; and&#13;
iii) persons from whom land and their homestead are acquired.&#13;
B. Landless, who derive their livelihood from the land to be&#13;
acquired for a minimum of three years prior to the date of&#13;
notification (of intention to acquire land)&#13;
i)   Sharecroppers, land lessees, tenants and day labourers;&#13;
ii) tribals dependent on forest produce; and&#13;
iii) persons whose homestead is acquired.&#13;
Eligibility and compensation&#13;
11.  The table below shows the compensation and rehabilitation efforts&#13;
subsidiaries will offer for each person or family affected by one of&#13;
their projects. Evidence to the effect that a person is a legitimate&#13;
PAP will need to be provided in the form of a written legal document,&#13;
or reference to a record, such as a revenue officer certificate, elec-&#13;
toral roll, ration card or school record.&#13;
Rehabilitation efforts&#13;
Land for land (Package B)&#13;
12.  In many areas where subsidiaries expand their mining operations,&#13;
land is scarce. It has been the experience of these companies that few&#13;
project affected people opt for acquiring land. Wherever possible and&#13;
if so desired by the PAPs who are landowners, PAPs will identify and&#13;
purchase land with assistance from the subsidiary. The land and its&#13;
area should be such so as to provide better or at least the same income&#13;
to the PAP, which he was deriving from his original land. The following&#13;

(c) the subsidiary will assist a PAP to&#13;
establish non-farm self-employment&#13;
through the provision of infrastructure,&#13;
petty contracts or formation of ccopera-&#13;
tives (Package C);&#13;
(d) if none of the other packages are avail-&#13;
able, a PAP with less than two acres&#13;
would receive rehabilitation assistance&#13;
in the form of a subsistence allowance or&#13;
grant to be used for productive invest-&#13;
ments provided that his income from other&#13;
sources does not exceed Rs 12000/- per&#13;
annum (Package D);&#13;
A(ii) Persons whose homestead is acquired             The PAP will receive the replacement cost of his&#13;
homestead and the structures on it. In addition,&#13;
the subsidiaries acquiring his homestead will&#13;
provide (a) an alternate house site measuring&#13;
100 square meters per family, (b) assistance in&#13;
designing the new house, if so desired by the&#13;
PAP, and (c) a shifting allowance to cover the&#13;
full cost of transporting his belongings to the&#13;
relocation site. (Package E)&#13;
B(i)    Sharecroppers, land lessees, tenants and  Package C or jobs with contractors. Contractors&#13;
day labourers                                 will be persuaded to give jobs to eligible PAPs&#13;
on a preferential basis, where feasible.&#13;
B(ii)   Landless tribals                              Package C or jobs with contractors. Contractors&#13;
will be persuaded to give jobs to eligible PAPs&#13;
on a preferential basis, where feasible.  In&#13;
addition, the subsidiaries will shift the tribal&#13;
community as a unit and provide facilities to&#13;
meet the specific needs of the tribal community&#13;
that will allow them to maintain their unique&#13;
cultural identity.&#13;

modalities will be exercised to assist eligible project affected per-&#13;
sons to acquire land, if they so wish.&#13;
i)   A PAP who chooses this option, will not be entitled to any&#13;
other rehabilitation option. However, shifting allowance at&#13;
market rate to cover the full cost of transportation will be&#13;
provided to the PAPs for moving to the new area; and&#13;
ii) the PAP may purchase land on a "willing buyer - willing&#13;
seller" basis within a limited geographic area and specified&#13;
time period.&#13;
Non-farm self-employment (Package C)&#13;
13. For PAPs who opt for the non-farm self-employment package the&#13;
subsidiary will assist in developing such options as dairy and poultry&#13;
production, shops and petty contracts.&#13;
Rehabilitation assistance (Package D)&#13;
14. If none of the other options are available to PAPs with less than&#13;
two acres of land, the subsidiary would provide rehabilitation assis-&#13;
tance to ensure that the PAPs are able to regain their former standard&#13;
of living or earning capacity. The assistance would be in the form of a&#13;
subsistence allowance or a lumpsum grant to be used against productive&#13;
investments.&#13;
15. If the PAP chooses the lump sum grant, it will be calculated on&#13;
the same basis as the subsistence allowance. During a three-year period&#13;
following the preparation of the RAP, the PAP can select a productive&#13;
investment. Until the payment is made, the grant would be held in an&#13;
interest-bearing account.&#13;
Women&#13;
16. Special attempts will be made to ensure that women will be given&#13;
adequate access to income generating opportunities offered under this&#13;
policy.&#13;
Jobs&#13;
17. Jobs will be given to eligible landless PAPs on a preferential&#13;
basis when outside recruitment becomes necessary.&#13;
Connmity facilities&#13;
18. The subsidiary will provide to the resettlement site a school,&#13;
road with street light, pucca drain, pond, dugwell and/or tubewell for&#13;
drinking water supply, community center, place of worship, dispensary,&#13;
grazing land for cattle and play ground. Similar infrastructural facil-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
Annex2.4&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
ity, if necessary, will be extended to the host locality. The community&#13;
facilities and services would be available to all residents of the&#13;
area, including PAPs and the host population.&#13;
19. The approach for operation of community facilities would be flex-&#13;
ible and all efforts will be made to involve the State and local self&#13;
Government/Panchayat for operating the facilities. To achieve this,&#13;
subsidiaries will pursue with these agencies to ensure the same. The&#13;
planning of the community facilities and their construction should be&#13;
undertaken in consultation with the affected community.&#13;
Implementation, monitoring and evaluation, dispute mechanism&#13;
20. The rehabilitation action plan will address the following:&#13;
i)   The project design, including an analysis of alternative&#13;
designs aimed at avoiding or minimizing resettlement;&#13;
ii)  socio-economic survey and activities to ensure restoration&#13;
of incomes of PAPs in line with Coal India's resettlement&#13;
and rehabilitation policy;&#13;
iii) description of the institutional and other mechanisms for&#13;
provision of entitlements;&#13;
iv)  time table for the acquisition and preparation of the re-&#13;
settlement site(s);&#13;
v)   the cost and budgets for the resettlement and rehabilitation&#13;
of PAPs;&#13;
vi)  project-specific arrangements to deal with grievances of&#13;
PAPs; and&#13;
vii) time tables, benchmarks and arrangements for monitoring the&#13;
resettlement and rehabilitation effort.&#13;
Socio-economic survey&#13;
21. A baseline socioeconomic survey will be carried out to identify&#13;
the PAPs to ensure restoration of incomes of PAPs in line with Coal&#13;
India's Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy. This survey will be&#13;
conducted, prior to notification under the relevant land acquisition&#13;
Acts, by the subsidiaries with the help of reputed outside independent&#13;
institutional agencies, who are well versed with the social matrix of&#13;
the area.&#13;
22. The basic objective of the socio-economic study will be to gener-&#13;
ate baseline data on the social and economic status of the population&#13;
who are likely to lose their means of livelihood or homestead to the&#13;
acquisition of the land for the project. The data base will be used to&#13;
formulate a viable and practical RAP for the affected persons in line&#13;
with their entitlements.&#13;

Schedule of census and formulation of Rehabilitation Action Plans (RAP)&#13;
23. Once the demographic and socio-economic data is available, the&#13;
RAP will be formulated in consultation with the PAPs and the State&#13;
Government. The RAP will be formulated as a simultaneous activity with&#13;
the land acquisition process.&#13;
Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
24. The RAP will be monitored and evaluated periodically after the&#13;
completion of the land acquisition process.&#13;
i)   The resettlement and rehabilitation activities are the re-&#13;
sponsibility of a separate group, both at the projects and&#13;
corporate level, which will be constituted for planning,&#13;
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the RAP. At the&#13;
corporate level the group will be headed by a senior man-&#13;
ager, whereas at the project, an executive of the rank of&#13;
manager will head the group. The project group should have&#13;
at least one member with social science experience and/or&#13;
skills.&#13;
ii)  The project group will closely interact with the state au-&#13;
thorities during the implementation of the RAP. Although the&#13;
subsidiaries will develop the plots and infrastructural&#13;
facilities in the resettlement colony and actively implement&#13;
the RAP, assistance of State authorities will be taken for&#13;
administrative services such as allotment of land. Implemen-&#13;
tation will be planned, monitored and corrective measures&#13;
will be incorporated in the RAP, if needed. In addition to&#13;
the State Government, the PAPs, the village leaders includ-&#13;
ing the Pradhans and NGOs will be consulted and associated&#13;
with the implementation of the RAP.&#13;
iii) The Resettlement and Rehabilitation Cell at the corporate&#13;
level will evaluate the implementation of the RAP after its&#13;
completion.&#13;
Mechanism for dealing with disputes&#13;
25. A committee comprising nominee(s) of the State Government,&#13;
nominee(s) of the project general manager of the subsidiaries, a repre-&#13;
sentative of the PAP and an independent party, such as a respected&#13;
community leader, a retired judge or principal of a reputed local in-&#13;
stitution of higher education, will be constituted to examine the&#13;
grievances of the PAP and propose corrective actions as required. The&#13;
subsidiaries will make arrangements for establishing the Committee and&#13;
bear the cost.&#13;

Annex 2.5 COAL INDIA'S COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PLAN&#13;
Introduction&#13;
Coal mining has had a profound impact on the communities living&#13;
in the areas where coal mines were established. Many of these areas,&#13;
particularly in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Bihar, were&#13;
relatively isolated from industrial development, often with a tribal&#13;
population, with little contact to the outside society. The establish-&#13;
ment of coal mines brought rapid modern industrial development to the&#13;
area, took up large tracts of land, displaced people living there,&#13;
offered some employment, and gave a whole new socio-economic profile to&#13;
the area. It included influx of non-tribal people into the area.&#13;
The most obvious social effect on indigenous communities of the&#13;
mining activities has been the loss of land for living, agriculture,&#13;
grazing, collection of forest produce for food and fuel. The less obvi-&#13;
ous, gradual and long term, impact may be the change in traditional&#13;
lifestyles which was based largely on subsistence economy. Many such&#13;
changes, probably can not be ascribed directly to the loss of produc-&#13;
tive assets, but has more to do with the rapid introduction of compet-&#13;
ing ways of living (e.g. introduction of non-agricultural related occu-&#13;
pations, money-economy, including salaried labor, etc.). This induced&#13;
development may leave the original inhabitants and the indigenous com-&#13;
munities in a situation beyond their control, without the proper means&#13;
to take advantage of the opportunities and challenges that this devel-&#13;
opment represented. Although original inhabitants were offered employ-&#13;
ment in the mines as rehabilitation measures for lost land, it is&#13;
largely outside entrepreneurs, attracted to the new opportunities, who&#13;
have been able to take advantage of the opportunities following the&#13;
establishments of the mines.&#13;
The aim of the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan is to present&#13;
a policy, an institutional framework and a strategy for implementation&#13;
of activities that will assist indigenous communities (i.e. communities&#13;
living in the mining area when the mine was established), allowing for&#13;
informed public participation in the formulation and implementation of&#13;
the plan, and ensuring that benefits reach the weaker sections of the&#13;
communities, in particular Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes, on a&#13;
sustainable basis.&#13;
The Indigenous Peoples Development Plan of Coal India sets out&#13;
the basic features of this community development in Coal India in the&#13;
project. It sets out the scope, limitations and priorities of Coal&#13;
Note: This is the original text of the policy statement regarding Coal India's Community Development&#13;
which was issued in September 1995.&#13;

Annex 2.5&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
India's commitment to community development in the areas of a mine's&#13;
influence. Attached are the guidelines for preparation of mine specific&#13;
Indigenous Peoples Development Plans&#13;
The plan builds on the community development program, that Coal&#13;
India is already implementing in villages around the mines as part of&#13;
it's welfare activities. Community development in Coal India is done as&#13;
a contribution to the national Twenty Point Program for social&#13;
upliftment. The community development program of Coal India has had a&#13;
total budget of approximately 50 million rupees per year in the last&#13;
five years. The assistance given under the community development pro-&#13;
gram is mainly in the form of infrastructural improvements.&#13;
The present plan is limited in scope, both in terms of coverage&#13;
and cost. The plan covers settlements (a cluster of dwellings) in close&#13;
proximity to the mines, and presents a frame budget, which makes the&#13;
setting of priorities by the communities a necessity. The reason for&#13;
this is the assumption that the people living nearest to the mine are&#13;
most affected by the mining activities, and the fact that the present&#13;
implementation and monitoring capacity, for such essential social&#13;
projects, is limited.&#13;
On the basis of the experience gained under this project, Coal&#13;
India will review the policy and its implementation and make a decision&#13;
on the settlements to be covered, the scope of the budget, and for&#13;
replication to all mines under Coal India.&#13;
The effects of coal mining on surrounding communities&#13;
Most of the subprojects are 15 to 25 years old and located in&#13;
already established coal fields. The coal fields are all located in&#13;
previous rural and forest areas. The communities inhabiting these ar-&#13;
eas, before the introduction of coal mining, were largely dependent on&#13;
a subsistence economy, based on agriculture and forest produce. Contact&#13;
to the 'modern' world was very limited. The indigenous communities&#13;
consisted both of tribal and caste communities, which have been in&#13;
contact and engaged in barter trade for centuries. The introduction of&#13;
a coal mine into this society represents the 'modern' world's entry&#13;
into the area and a new situation for traditional communities. This&#13;
change typically involves the following:&#13;
*    An influx of outsiders to the area. Officers and skilled&#13;
laborers of Coal India, contractors with workers, and other&#13;
businesses to serve these groups&#13;
*    Employment of male local population as unskilled labor&#13;
*    Large groups of households becomes economically dependent on&#13;
the coal mine and its wage labor, because of loss of agri-&#13;
cultural and forest land, and employment in the mine, or&#13;
periodically with the contractors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
Annex 2.5&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
*    With the shift from agriculture to wage labor, a shift of&#13;
economy from subsistence to money and market economy.&#13;
*    New differentiation's are introduced in the communities.&#13;
Between those who are employed in the mine and those who&#13;
still depend on a subsistence agriculture. Social ties are&#13;
disrupted and traditional institutions are weakened&#13;
*    Opportunities for employment in the mine is greater for men,&#13;
and the role of women changes drastically from one of shared&#13;
work and responsibilities to one, where women become respon-&#13;
sible for domestic affairs, mainly related to meeting basic&#13;
needs of the family.&#13;
In the present day mine locality, a multitude of social groups&#13;
live and interact. The communities originally belonging to the area,&#13;
may be at a disadvantage in this induced development, and may have&#13;
difficulties in getting a share in the benefits of the development&#13;
process.&#13;
Indigenous peoples and community development in Coal India&#13;
Coal India has a history of providing relative high standards of&#13;
living for its employees. Not only are salaries competitive, but secu-&#13;
rity in employment is high and means access to staff quarters, with&#13;
electricity and water supply, and well functioning educational and&#13;
health facilities.&#13;
Both with regard to adverse environmental impact, caused by the&#13;
production of coal, and adverse social impact, caused by land acquisi-&#13;
tion, Coal India has made major progress over the last decade by in-&#13;
troducing policies and plans for minimizing and mitigating such impact.&#13;
Coal India wants to proceed in it's effort to create a modern,&#13;
efficient operation run by environmentally and socially responsible&#13;
organizations, by stipulating the framework within which Coal India&#13;
will assist the communities of the surrounding habitations.&#13;
Objectives and beneficiaries of indigenous peoples development&#13;
Coal India accepts that coal mining has contributed to deterio-&#13;
rating environment and social conditions by inducing a rapid industri-&#13;
alization' of the areas. The ultimate objective of Coal India's indig-&#13;
enous peoples development program is to contribute to a healthy and&#13;
well educated population, living in a rich natural environment, belong-&#13;
ing to prospering communities. The immediate objective is to assist&#13;
indigenous local communities in the mine area to create, revive and&#13;
maintain relevant and functioning community assets, institutions and&#13;
services that can improve their choices and living standard in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
Annex 2.5&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
'modern' world, and maintain and develop traditional ways of living and&#13;
the social ties of the communities.&#13;
The intended beneficiaries of the Indigenous Peoples Development&#13;
Plan are communities, living within the mine's area of influence. This&#13;
plan has tentatively defined this as the area within one kilometer from&#13;
the boundary of the mine and all its infrastructure, i.e. the total&#13;
area which is or will be physically controlled by the mine, throughout&#13;
the life of the mine. All habitations within this area will be covered&#13;
by this plan, unless it is included under a resettlement action plan.&#13;
However this delineation should only be taken as a rough guide, and&#13;
justified reasons for extending this may exist in individual cases.&#13;
The benefits of the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan are open&#13;
to all communities, but will be especially aimed at tribal communities&#13;
and women and youth. The activities will primarily seek to address the&#13;
needs of these groups. In all-tribal villages the target group will be&#13;
the community as a whole. In the case of mixed villages, the Plan&#13;
adopts a poverty focus that will benefit all weaker communities (in&#13;
particular SC).&#13;
This development program is targeted to organization and groups&#13;
in the communities, and no individual entitlements are envisaged. How-&#13;
ever, individuals from the communities will benefit from the program&#13;
and, as organizers of development activities, they will play a critical&#13;
role in the successful implementation of this plan.&#13;
The indigenous peoples development program is a program of part-&#13;
nership between Coal India and the surrounding communities. Therefore,&#13;
project activities must be contributed to by both Coal India and local&#13;
communities, either in cash or in kind (materials/labor).&#13;
Components of Indigenous Peoples Development Plan&#13;
It follows from the participatory approach to the preparation of&#13;
the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan that the specific activities&#13;
under the plan cannot be determined at the corporate level of Coal&#13;
India. However, Coal India has a particular responsibility for minimiz-&#13;
ing direct adverse effects on the communities from the introduction of&#13;
coal mining.&#13;
No community facility can be sustained without motivated and re-&#13;
sponsible social institutions/organizations. Therefore the program will&#13;
not only support the creation of physical assets to serve the communi-&#13;
ties, but also support community activities that will strengthen the&#13;
local capacity to operate and maintain these facilities and enhance the&#13;
communities' ability to take advantage of opportunities created by the&#13;
changed social and economical environment in the area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-71-&#13;
Annex2.5&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
Possible physical and institutional/organizational components for&#13;
support may include:&#13;
* Water supply and sanitation&#13;
* Educational facilities and activities&#13;
* Health facilities and health and nutrition activities&#13;
* Vocational training facilities and activities&#13;
* Electricity supply&#13;
* Improvement of roads&#13;
* Environmental management and improvements (e.g. afforestation)&#13;
* Cultural facilities and activities&#13;
* Additional community development activities may be taken up&#13;
The activities of the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan fall&#13;
within the following three broad categories: community assets (infra-&#13;
structure); community activities; and training and capacity building:&#13;
Community assets include the following physical infrastructure:&#13;
school, community hall, link road, pathway, culvert, tubewell, dugwell,&#13;
small check dam, lift irrigation, PHC/dispensary, market place, temple,&#13;
village drains, etc. Community assets have been identified according to&#13;
the outcome of the preliminary Participatory Rural Appraisal(PRA) un-&#13;
dertaken by consultants as part of the background study for the Indig-&#13;
enous Peoples Development Plan. The final decision on which assets to&#13;
implement will be determined through the baseline survey, PRA and vil-&#13;
lage level planning. Implementation will be done under the authority of&#13;
the Community Development &amp; Resettlement &amp; Rehabilitation (CD&amp;R&amp;R)&#13;
officer of the mine. There will be NGO involvement (liaison/coordina-&#13;
tion/supervision) and community participation (through the established&#13;
village working groups) in all stages of implementation: site selec-&#13;
tion, design, civil works/labor contribution.&#13;
Community activities include: mixed plantation on hilly slopes,&#13;
agro-forestry, grazing land, cooperative marketing (e.g. milk), horti-&#13;
culture, fisheries, afforestation, catchment area/watershed management,&#13;
adult (especially female) literacy, Mahila Samities, preventive health&#13;
care, sports. Planning and implementation of these activities will to a&#13;
large extent depend on NGO and village initiatives, less on input from&#13;
Coal India and Government. However, linking up to relevant government&#13;
department, like forestry, horticulture and cooperatives is important&#13;
for availing of extension services and technical advise.&#13;
Training/skills development and capacity building of indigenous&#13;
communities will primarily be the responsibility of NGOs who will in-&#13;
vite technical expertise for special skills development (e.g. agro-&#13;
forestry, literacy, health) from either government departments or ex-&#13;
ternal sources on a case by case basis. The objective of these activi-&#13;
ties is three-fold: (i) to develop technical skills for new productive&#13;
sectors or niches; (ii) to enhance existing production systems and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex2.5&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
sustain traditional use of natural resources; and (iii) to raise aware-&#13;
ness and develop organizational capacity and strength (empowerment) at&#13;
the community level, for leadership, generally and within village work-&#13;
ing groups and organizations like Mahila Samities and youth groups&#13;
Institutional arrangement for Indigenous Peoples Development Plan&#13;
The ultimate responsibility of community development of indig-&#13;
enous communities lies with the communities themselves. Coal India, the&#13;
State Government, and NGOs can only support and facilitate this devel-&#13;
opment. Providing basic physical facilities to the communities, without&#13;
their active contribution and involvement in the planning, implementa-&#13;
tion and running of the facility, has shown to lead to under utiliza-&#13;
tion, breakdown of services and a feeling of apathy and dependency.&#13;
To formulate community needs and actions which could improve life&#13;
in the community, focus group discussions will be held, facilitated by&#13;
an NGO, preferably with female field workers. A special effort to en-&#13;
sure women's participation in these focus groups will be made. They may&#13;
be held separately for each community in the area. The outcome of these&#13;
discussions would be a preliminary list of needs for the community, and&#13;
voluntary village working groups for each item on the list. These work-&#13;
ing groups would, with the assistance of NGOs, Coal India and the Block&#13;
Development Officer, formulate specific proposals for community devel-&#13;
opment activities to be submitted to the area's Community Development&#13;
Council for financing. The proposals must include the contribution of&#13;
the communities themselves. It is envisaged that these working groups&#13;
will continue when a proposal is approved for channeling local contri-&#13;
bution and monitoring of progress.&#13;
To reach consensus on development needs, set priorities for de-&#13;
velopment of the communities, take decision on the implementation of&#13;
actual proposals, and monitoring progress of ongoing development ac-&#13;
tivities, an overall Community Development Council will be formed. This&#13;
will include the Gram Sarpanch/Mukhia, Bongas/tribal chiefs and school&#13;
teachers from the community, the Block Development Officer from the&#13;
State government, the Community Development and R&amp;R Officer (CD&amp;R&amp;R&#13;
Officer) of the mine as member/secretary, one local senior trade union&#13;
leader from the work force (if more than one union is present, the&#13;
trade union representative should be from the largest), and an NGO&#13;
representative. The Council will be chaired by the General Manager of&#13;
the area. In case the Council so wish, they may co-opt other represen-&#13;
tatives to participate in the council (e.g. important local voluntary&#13;
organizations, like Mahila (women's) Samity, etc.) The Council will&#13;
meet quarterly. The responsibility for the budget allocated to indig-&#13;
enous peoples development plan should rest with the Community Develop-&#13;
ment Council.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
Annex2.5&#13;
Page 7 of 7&#13;
In each mine a full time Community Development and R&amp;R Officer&#13;
(CD&amp;R&amp;R Officer) will be posted for effective implementation, coordina-&#13;
tion and follow-up. This process has already started under the Re-&#13;
settlement and Rehabilitation Program. Close coordination to the wel-&#13;
fare officer must be maintained to ensure that welfare measures for the&#13;
employees, where feasible, will be extended to the local population.&#13;
Training programs for staff in Coal India, connected to community de-&#13;
velopment will be undertaken.&#13;
Coal India will not alone have the capacity to organize and fa-&#13;
cilitate the mobilization of focus groups and working groups. NGOs/&#13;
Community Based Organizations (CBOs) with experience from tribal commu-&#13;
nities and a proven track record in community development will be&#13;
needed to assist in facilitating the process. The NGO should preferably&#13;
have female field workers. Involvement and mobilization of local CBOs&#13;
will be encouraged. Thus, NGOs will have a key role as an intermediary&#13;
between communities and Coal India and the Government. NGO presence is&#13;
considered the most important prerequisite for successful planning,&#13;
implementation and hand-over of project assets, activities and results&#13;
to community management during the latter part of the five year project&#13;
period.&#13;
The institutional arrangement has also been designed in such a&#13;
way that it will not only facilitate continued orientation, training&#13;
and capacity building in the surrounding communities, but also provide&#13;
for institutional support to elected bodies, CBOs/voluntary organiza-&#13;
tions, relevant government officers and Coal India staff involved in&#13;
implementing this Plan.&#13;
The main role of Coal India is to provide financial support for&#13;
establishment of community infrastructure, and relevant community ac-&#13;
tivities, and to provide for temporary outside assistance from NGOs/&#13;
consultants and others. In principle the operation, utilization and&#13;
maintenance of created community infrastructure lies with the communi-&#13;
ties, although Coal India may assist partly with initial operational&#13;
cost in a transitional period of no more than two years. The State&#13;
government should be pursued to deliver public services, and extend&#13;
development activities, according to state regulations, in the area.&#13;

Annex 2.6 CONSULTATIONS AND PARTICIPATION OF PROJECT-AFFECTED PEOPLE&#13;
Dissemination&#13;
I1.    Coal India strongly believes in proper and timely dissemination of information related to its&#13;
policies on resettlement and rehabilitation and the environment among the various stake holders in coal&#13;
mining. Coal India is of the view that knowledge about the various provisions in the resettlement and&#13;
rehabilitation policy for the project-affected people will be to Coal India's advantage, as no one will be&#13;
then able to mislead the affected population. As part of this philosophy, Coal India has done the following:&#13;
*   Coal India revised its resettlement and rehabilitation policy.&#13;
*   Coal India, for the first time in the history of coal mining, had its policy on resettlement and&#13;
rehabilitation translated into all the local languages of the different major coal producing&#13;
states, including Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, West Bengal and Maharashtra.&#13;
*   Translated versions of the policy have been made available in the headquarters of the subsid-&#13;
iaries and at Coal India headquarters in Calcutta.&#13;
*   In SECL, small booklets with information on the definitions of different categories of&#13;
project-affected people and their various entitlements as per the resettlement and rehabilita-&#13;
tion policy have been prepared in Hindi, the local language, and distributed in the sub-&#13;
projects. Other subsidiaries are in the process of carrying out similar information campaigns.&#13;
*   Identity cards with the photograph of each project-affected person entitled to rehabilitation&#13;
and specifying his or her entitlements from the subproject authorities are being issued. Most&#13;
of the women, shedding their traditional shyness to the surprise of many a pessimist, have&#13;
been photographed for the issue of ID cards. In SECL this has been mostly completed. Other&#13;
subsidiaries have also taken steps to issue ID cards to the entitled people.&#13;

Participation&#13;
2.     Coal India's interaction with the people living in the mining areas, albeit in a non-institutional&#13;
way, dates back to the late fifties (long before the loan from the World Bank for the Coal Sector Rehabili-&#13;
tation Project was sought) when the country's coal production started to grow. Even a very casual stroll&#13;
around any of the villages near any coal mine of Coal India will show the presence of some materials&#13;
donated by the nearby mine authority in use by the villagers. Water pumped out of coal mines has been&#13;
traditionally used by the nearby villages for irrigating fields. Used wire ropes are used for fencing; corru-&#13;
gated tin sheets donated by the mine have been used in the roofs of schools and "chandi mandaps" (com-&#13;
munity centers). The mine authorities sometimes provide dug wells, ponds, tube wells, or piped water&#13;
supply for the villages. Non-recurring grants are given to schools and colleges located in the vicinity of the&#13;
coal mines. Periodic child immunization camps are organized for the benefit of the population living in the&#13;
mining areas.&#13;
3.     The participation of the mine manager in the yearly festival of the tribals (celebrated in the&#13;
monsoon after sowing season) in the nearby villages is a regular feature in the village social life. The mine&#13;
authorities' participation in the "Durga Puja" of the neighboring villages is time tested and continues even&#13;
today.&#13;
4.     These interactions with the people of the neighboring localities of the mines were not institutional-&#13;
ized and mine managers adopted them to have a good neighborly relation with the population. This&#13;
practice has been given the garb of some institutional arrangement in recent times (from the late eighties)&#13;
by adopting yearly community development activities in the neighborhood of the mines. Only sometimes&#13;
the weaker sections of the villagers like the scheduled tribes and scheduled castes had a chance to express&#13;
their opinion or to indicate their choice of infrastructure to be constructed under the community develop-&#13;
ment program. The community development program has usually been found to benefit the better off&#13;
villagers who generally manage to comer the benefits. The poor and illiterate villagers generally do not&#13;
and cannot approach appropriate mine authorities to get the benefits of community development.&#13;
Consultation&#13;
Rehabilitation Action Plans and Indigenous Peoples Development Plans&#13;
5.     Coal India did not have any structured system of consultation, though earlier the project-affected&#13;
people or their representatives, local political leaders or NGOs would approach project authorities for&#13;
settlement of their grievances. Importance was given only to the land losers. Nothing or very little was&#13;
done for the landless. Land was and still is acquired by following the Govermment statutes (offer of&#13;
employment based on certain norm, usually one job per two or three acres and monetary compensation for&#13;
land and structures).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
Annex 2.6&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
6.    There was a movement in which people having no or very little land agitated for employment or&#13;
some sort of compensation for livelihood, as they lost their traditional means of earning. Subsidiaries dealt&#13;
with this subject in various ways since some subsidiaries still needed additional laborers and offers of jobs&#13;
were possible for smaller land holdings.&#13;
7.     Some States issued guidelines through circulars or directives on the matter, thereby laying the&#13;
guidelines for giving employment to project-affected people under various categories. The valuation of the&#13;
land also mainly remained with the district or State authorities. In the case of Sonepur-Bazari, another&#13;
World Bank funded project, the Government of India, in discussion with State authorities, local politicians&#13;
and the affected people developed a package, popularly known as Gulla package, whereby persons having&#13;
very little land and not otherwise qualifying for job, were given a subsistence allowance each month for 20&#13;
years.&#13;
8.    However, this was not accepted by all the subsidiaries. In 1994, while the Coal Sector Rehabilita-&#13;
tion Project was with the visiting World Bank Mission, it was conceived that a uniform policy on resettle-&#13;
ment and rehabilitation should be drawn out for Coal India as a whole. After protracted discussions with&#13;
all concerned, including the World Bank, the resettlement and rehabilitation policy of Coal India was&#13;
drawn up and approved by the Board of Directors of Coal India and the Govemment of India.&#13;
9.    Coal India made a conscious effort to remedy this situation at the time of preparation of Rehabili-&#13;
tation Action Plans and Indigenous Peoples Development Plans as part of the Coal Sector Rehabilitation&#13;
Project and the Coal India Environmental and Social Mitigation Project. They are:&#13;
e   Coal India engaged nine consultants/NGOs to carry out Base Line Socio-Economic Surveys&#13;
of the population that will be affected by the execution of the 14 subprojects with project-&#13;
affected people in the immediate ten year time horizon. Based on the date of the baseline&#13;
surveys, Rehabilitation Action Plans have been prepared.&#13;
*   The consultants/NGOs conducted an extensive house to house census with a structured&#13;
questionnaire to elicit information about the affected people regarding their current socio-&#13;
economic condition. The adults were asked by the consultant to indicate their preferred&#13;
means of economic rehabilitation.&#13;
*   The consultants were encouraged by Coa! India to elicit information about choices of means&#13;
of rehabilitation if jobs in coal mines were not available.&#13;
*   Bids from 24 NGOs/consultants, including Bulu Imam of INTACH, Awdesh Kumar of SLS,&#13;
Madhu Kohli of PIRG, MARG, SANLET, CASS, PRERNA were called. Only six responded&#13;
and five were selected (AIMS, ORG, MODE, AFC and AICIRD) to prepare Indigenous&#13;
Peoples Development Plans for 25 mines. These consultants/NGOs adopted focus group&#13;
discussion, participatory rural appraisal and indepth interviews with the affected population&#13;
to elicit information about their felt needs for infrastructures in the villages to improve the&#13;
quality of life.&#13;
*   The consultants also elicited information from the villagers who will be available for "shram&#13;
dan" (voluntary labor) if the coal company comes forward with funds to build community&#13;
assets and conduct productive community activities for them.&#13;
*   The consultants have utilized the services of some of the NGOs/Community Based Organi-&#13;
zations operating in the mining areas for this information. Services of LAJAR and CLEAR&#13;
were utilized by AIMS in SECL for the Indigenous Peoples Development Plans.&#13;

Environmental Management Plans&#13;
10.   In pursuance of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, amended in May of 1994, the coal&#13;
project proponent is required to submit an application to the Secretary of the Ministry of Environment and&#13;
Forest (MoEF) for an environmental clearance and, if acquisition of forest land is involved, a forest&#13;
clearance. The application needs to include the project report as well as an Environmental Impact Assess-&#13;
ment Report/Environment Management Plan prepared accordance with the guidelines issued by MOEF&#13;
from time to time. The reports submitted are evaluated and assessed by the Impact Assessment Agency&#13;
(MoEF) with the assistance of the Environment Appraisal Committee which includes NGOs and Member&#13;
of Parliament. The MoEF, at the advice of Environment Appraisal Committee, can call for hearings on&#13;
proposed projects with project-affected people, if they believe that this would be in the public interest.&#13;
Hearings are usually held if there is large-scale resettlement involved or environmental impacts. Project-&#13;
affected people and their elected representatives can convey their views or object to the MoEF before a&#13;
clearance letter is issued. If considered necessary, the Environment Acppraisal Committee visits the&#13;
project site. After they is fully satisfied with the Environmental Impact Assessment and the mitigation&#13;
measures to be taken up, the MoEF issues a clearance letter for the project with stipulations that would&#13;
ensure the implementation of the required mitigation measures.&#13;
l.    As stated earlier, a monthly meeting is held at subsidiary headquarters and at Area General&#13;
Managers' offices on a fixed day in each month, with the local NGOs and project-affected people. At the&#13;
time of preparation of draft Environmental Action Plans for the 25 mines, consultations were held at&#13;
subsidiary headquarters, Area General Managers' offices and at Coal India headquarters in Calcutta. The&#13;
finalization of the Environmental Action Plans were made with due consideration of the outcome of the&#13;
suggestions and recommendations obtained in these consultations:&#13;
A.  A workshop was held of May 27-28, 1995 at Hotel Hindusthan, Calcutta, to discuss the draft&#13;
Sectoral Impact Assessment and Environmental Action Plans for the 25 mines. Representa-&#13;
tives of subsidiary companies, representatives from different NGOs and environmental&#13;
organizations and project-affected people from subprojects attended the workshop. Each&#13;
participant from an NGO and each project-affected person came out with useful suggestions&#13;
for improvement of Sectoral Impact Assessment and Environmental Action Plans. However,&#13;
in general, they have given more stress on employment and the rehabilitation and resettle-&#13;
ment problems. Project-affected people from SECL projects have indicated their satisfaction&#13;
with the rehabilitation and resettlement done in Gevra Opencast Project. They also indicated&#13;
that they have not faced any problem in meeting the project authority, to sort out the prob-&#13;
lems. Project-affected people from MCL said that they have received employment but the&#13;
resettlement problems are yet to be sorted out. Bulu Imam, NGO, has stressed the cultural&#13;
rehabilitation of the people affected and taking care for the upkeep of archeological sites in&#13;
the mining regions. Some of the recommendations were:&#13;
*   An awareness campaign for environmental and rehabilitation and resettlement issues&#13;
should be initiated.&#13;
*   Water conservation measures should be adopted as per site conditions.&#13;
*   Discharged water should be used for pisciculture and promotion of model farms.&#13;
*   Settling tanks should be provided before the water is discharged to the natural water&#13;
course.&#13;
*   NGOs should be involved in the environment management program from the planning&#13;
stage to implementation.&#13;
*   Periodic health camps should be organized in the neighboring villages.&#13;
*   Planting of fruit trees and bamboo should be promoted for economic benefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 2.6&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
*   Metal roads should be provided for coal transport.&#13;
*   Agro-forestry, in association with State Governments, should be made available to&#13;
project-affected people as employment and income generation work.&#13;
*   Surface overburden dumping should be stopped and plantation on it should be made.&#13;
*   Archeological sites including sites of religious worship should be mapped and pro-&#13;
tected.&#13;
*   A representative body of project-affected people should be involved in the selection of&#13;
the resettlement site. Studies should be conducted regarding availability of water and&#13;
fertility of soil before finalizing the site.&#13;
*   As far as practicable, entire blocks of villages should be acquired to prevent fragmenta-&#13;
tion of holdings.&#13;
* The resettlement site should not be more than I Okm away from the mine site.&#13;
*   A representative of NGOs should be involved for technical guidance.&#13;
*   The objective of rehabilitation should be to improve the standard of living.&#13;
*   To avoid bad blood in families, Coal India should deal with the representative body of&#13;
the project-affected people regarding employment.&#13;
*   A baseline survey should be made for the host community before the resettlement site&#13;
is selected for proper harmonization and assimilation.&#13;
*   Compensation should be paid timely.&#13;
Coal India should devise attractive area-specific selfemployment opportunities so that&#13;
the pressure on jobs can be reduced.&#13;
B.  Mahanadi Coalfields Limited conducted a meeting to discuss the Sectoral Impact Assess-&#13;
ment and Environmental Action Plans at Kalinga on May 23, 1995; at Jagamath on May 18,&#13;
1995; and at lb Valley on May 20, 1995 with NGOs and project-affected people. MCL&#13;
officers, project-affected people from all the sub-projects in MCL and Mr. R. K. Sahoo&#13;
(NGO), IDHP attended the meeting. project-affected people mainly discussed rehabilitation&#13;
and resettlement problems and site specific environmental problems.&#13;
C.  Similar consultation was held at WCL Headquarters on June 16, 1995 with NGOs including&#13;
Dr. S. L. Lokre (NGO), Adimjari Sevak Sangha, Nagpur and Dr. R. D. Singh (NGO),&#13;
Sankalpa, Nagpur. With the project-affected people of Padampur, discussions were held on&#13;
June 22, 1995. At WCL Headquarters, a discussion was held on July 12, 1995 on the same&#13;
agenda with the project-affected people of Nilgai, Tiroda village, Mr. Pradeep Despande&#13;
(NGO) and Mr. A. S. Dhanwary (NGO), Society for Environmental Studies.&#13;
D.  In SECL, similar discussions were held at the Area General Manager's office. Discussions&#13;
were also held at Sohagpur on May 23, 1995 with project-affected people, Panchayat&#13;
Sarpanch and Counsilor; at Hasdeo on May 22, 1995 with project-affected people, Village&#13;
Tahaidar and a journalist; at Korba on May 22, 1995 with project-affected people, Village&#13;
Heads, Trade Union at Manikpur; at Kusmunda on May 23, 1995 with project-affected&#13;
people and State Government Representatives; at Bisrampur on May 23, 1995 with&#13;
Sarpanch, project-affected people, Representatives of scheduled tribe and scheduled caste;&#13;
and at Gevra on May 23, 1995 with project-affected people of Dipka, Gevra and Sarpanch.&#13;
Involvement of project-affected people and NGOs in implementation&#13;
12.   In the past as part of the legal procedure to acquire land, after paying compensation for the land&#13;
and assets of the project-affected people, nothing more was required to be done for their rehabilitation.&#13;
Rehabilitation of all the adult members of the family being affected by the acquisition of the land and also&#13;
the population indirectly dependent on the land being taken by the mine authority were never considered.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Coal India now has accepted to implement as part of the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project and the Coal&#13;
Sector Environmental and Social Mitigation Project the concept of entitlement of all the adult project-&#13;
affected people to different rehabilitation options.&#13;
13.   Another remarkably new concept has been the acceptance of the philosophy of actively involving&#13;
the project-affected people and the NGOs/Community Based Organizations in the implementation of the&#13;
Rehabilitation Action Plans and the Indigenous Peoples Development Plans. As part of this concept, the&#13;
following has been done:&#13;
&#149;   A two-day workshop was held in Calcutta on March 10-11, 1995 on "Income Generation and&#13;
Selfemployment Alternatives for Resettlement and Rehabilitation in the Coal Sector" which&#13;
16 NGOs from Orissa, eight NGOs from Bihar, seven NGOs from Madhya Pradesh, ten&#13;
persons of high repute from other states, four State Government departmnents of Orissa and&#13;
Madhya Pradesh (due to General Election in Bihar, no government department could come)&#13;
and 12 representatives of the national press/TV in addition to officers of Coal India and the&#13;
subsidiaries participated (around 150 persons attended the workshop). There was lively&#13;
discussion on the various selfemployment options that the project-affected people can pursue&#13;
as means of rehabilitation. Coal India's invited NGOs to come forward to help in the search&#13;
of making this new approach a success (although some of the NGOs branded it as an attempt&#13;
to pass the responsibility), there was a general welcome since Coal India accepted that&#13;
adequate resources will be made available to them.&#13;
*   Workshops have been organized in the subsidiaries in September and October 1995 where&#13;
NGOs and some of the representatives of the project-affected people participated.&#13;
*   Representatives of project-affected people (including one female affected person) have been&#13;
taken in the coordination and monitoring committees in SECL and CCL. The coordination&#13;
committee of each subproject formulates six monthly implementation schemes for undertak-&#13;
ing various activities as part of resettlement and rehabilitation measures and is actively&#13;
involved in their implementation. The monitoring committee at the subsidiary level approves&#13;
the budgets of the coordination committees and also resolves the grievances of the project-&#13;
affected people.&#13;
*   One NGO (CLEAR) was given a work order in November 1995 to work among the project-&#13;
affected people as part of resettlement and rehabilitation measures in Kusmunda Opencast&#13;
Project of SECL.&#13;
*   In CCL, similar work will be given to one NGO (Jagriti Bihar) for working among the&#13;
project-affected people of KD Hesalong Opencast Project.&#13;
Main concerns of project-affected people and NGOs (and also Coal India)&#13;
14.   The project-affected people are rightly concerned about their future as they apprehend the losing&#13;
of their traditional means of livelihood dependent on agriculture and minor forest produce (however&#13;
meager it may be). Like the saying "God must come to a poor man in the shape of a chapatti (country&#13;
bread) if he is to be listened;" the only means of rehabilitation eagerly sought by each and every affected&#13;
individual in the mining areas is employment in the coal mine which is causing the displacement.&#13;
15.   The NGOs/Community Based Organizations are also alarmed that nothing tangible has, until now,&#13;
been done to institutionalize the rehabilitation options to be exercised by the project-affected people and&#13;
supported by the coal mine. Coal India is concemed about the delay in getting sufficient land to continue&#13;
its coal production and the problems that arise in the mining areas due to agitation by the project-affected&#13;
people.&#13;

Page 7 of 7&#13;
Box 2.6.1 Background note summarizing Coal India's experience and issues raised by project-affected&#13;
people and others at the consultations&#13;
I. The concept of having formal and structured discussions/consultations with project-affected people, local State authorities, NGOs, etc. is&#13;
new to Coal India. Earlier, the project-affected people or their representatives used to discuss their grievances with the project authorities as&#13;
and when required.&#13;
2. As per the guidelines of the Bank, the projects covered under Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project were advised to hold regular monthly&#13;
meetingswith theproject-affectedpeople, NGOs, local state representatives, etc. They have also been advised tokeep the recordof themeetings.&#13;
3. The project authorities have started to hold such meetings/consultations. The meetings are chaired by General Manager of the area or his&#13;
nominated representative and attended by the officers of the environment, personnel, civil, estate, and legal departments. About 10-20 project-&#13;
affected people, NGOs, and others attend the meeting. The meetings include consultation on both social and environmental issues.&#13;
4. These meetings proceed without a fixed agenda. The project authority normally briefs the gathering about the progress of the project and&#13;
also about the constraints, if any, they are facing. The project-affected people and others normally raise the following social issues:&#13;
* The most common issue is the matter of employment of project-affected people. This reflects the current priority of the project-affected&#13;
people.&#13;
* The next most common issue regards payments of compensation and other benefits of resettlement and rehabilitation. The matter of delay&#13;
in payments has been discussed in many cases.&#13;
* Issues relating to facilities provided at the resettlement sites are also discussed. These cover the malfinctioning of hand pumps, deepening&#13;
of ponds, electrification, schools, community centers, etc.&#13;
* Some issues conceming individual problems are also discussed.&#13;
* After the success of self-employmentgeneration schemes started in Kusmunda Areaof SECL, the demandformore suchschemes is raised&#13;
in the SECL projects.&#13;
The following major issues on environment are also discussed:&#13;
* The most important issue to the project-affected people of the dust problem due to movement of vehicles on public roads passing through&#13;
the village;&#13;
* The issue of road accidents due to the movement of vehicles;&#13;
* The issue of drinking water problem due to lowering of water table during dry season;&#13;
* The aspect of damage due to vibration due to blasting; and&#13;
* The issue of discharge of polluted effluents to the ponds/rivers.&#13;
5. The meeting takes the note of all these complaints and initiates preventive action. The management feels that the meetings are meaningful&#13;
and serve to bridge the communication gap, thus reducing resultant misgivings. The continued participation of the project-affected people and&#13;
others indicates that they believe that their grievances are heard and redressed. The management looks at the meetings as an opportunity to&#13;
inform about the progress of the project and the constraints to the people. The meetings also serve to build the mutual trust.&#13;
16.       The insistence that a job to be given to each and every adult project-affected person by the coal&#13;
mine will affect the implementation of the coal projects. As a result, there will be no jobs and people at&#13;
large will be deprived of the other opportunities that are normally created in the mining areas. The tracer&#13;
study in Block-II Opencast Project has established that there are no project-affected people below the&#13;
poverty line, although BCCL has not consciously implemented any rehabilitation measures exclusively for&#13;
them. When told that the coal mine would be willing to train them at its own cost at their own village so&#13;
that they can have a very decent and assured monthly earning, not only men, but women are found to be&#13;
favorably inclined towards training for self-employment.&#13;
17.       The self-employment option for the project-affected people is an uncharted territory for not only&#13;
Coal India but also for the other industries. No one has any experience in it. But with the funds envisaged&#13;
to be made available through the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project and Coal Sector Environmental and&#13;
Social Mitigation Project, Coal India is waiting to take the plunge and make it a success in at least the 25&#13;
mines. It hopes to replicate the experience in the balance of mines in the next phase, provided its finances&#13;
permit.&#13;

Annex 2.7 COAL MINES SAFETY, HEALTH AND WELFARE&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    Concem for safety at the workplace and the health of coal mine workers in India has a long and&#13;
checkered history. The first framework of mining legislation, the Mines Act, came into force in 1901. This&#13;
Act mandated the employment of competent managers in mines and the appointment of Govemment&#13;
Mines Inspectors empowered to enter and inspect mines and to inquire into mining accidents. The Mines&#13;
Act and the subordinate legislation framed thereunder have been periodically updated to absorb technical&#13;
advancements and the recommendations of Intemational Labor Conferences, the findings of investigations&#13;
into mine disasters or the awareness about the causes of frequent accidents.&#13;
2.     Legislation goveming the safety and health aspects in the coal industry include the Mines Act&#13;
(1952), Coal Mines Regulation (1957), Mines Rules (1955) and the Indian Electricity Act (1956). The&#13;
Mines Act is the enabling statute for the establishment and enforcement of regulations and standards&#13;
governing the mines' safety and the workers' health and welfare. The Act defines the powers and respon-&#13;
sibilities of mine inspectors, mine owners, owners' agents and managers; establishes constitution of&#13;
committees to recommend on rules, inquire into accidents, decide on appeals and health and safety pre-&#13;
scriptions and hours and limitations of employment; establishes procedures for enforcement and penalties&#13;
for noncompliance; and has the power to make regulations and set standards. The Indian Electricity Act&#13;
sets standards for the safe use of electricity, safe electrical circuitry and flameproof enclosures in hazard-&#13;
ous gassy atmospheres.&#13;
3.     The Coal Mine Regulations cover, among other things, competency certifications for mine manag-&#13;
ers and other supervisory staff; duties and responsibilities of various parties; maintenance of mine plans;&#13;
maintenance of safe access to and exit from the mines; safe transport of men and material; the regulation&#13;
of ventilation, lighting and us of explosives; and precautions against gas, dust, noise, fire, water inrush,&#13;
etc. The Mine Rules contain procedures for setting up committees, courts of inquiry, medical examina-&#13;
tions, mine safety committees, etc. Besides the above, advisory circulars are issued time to time by the&#13;
Directorate General of Mine Safety on specific safety issues relating to the use of the plant and equipment&#13;
or mining practices. Specific measurable standards have been established for airbome dust, noise, and&#13;
lighting for both underground and opencast mines, and for ventilation in underground mines (Box 2.7.1).&#13;
4.     Application, inspection and enforcement of the Mines Act and its subordinate legislation are the&#13;
responsibility of the Director General of Mine Safety (DGMS) under the Ministry of Labor, Government&#13;
of India. Besides regular inspection of mines, DGMS officials organize inquiries into all fatal accidents,&#13;
collect a wide variety of statistics about the opening and closure of mines, manpower employment at&#13;
different places of work, cases of fatal and serious accidents, and occurrences of gas, explosion, fire and&#13;
inrush of water, etc.. Accident statistics are compiled from the notice of accidents submitted to the DGMS&#13;
and from the reports of its officials. Fatal accidents are defined as those in which at least one death is&#13;
involved and serious accidents are those which serious bodily injury to one or more persons resulting in&#13;
temporary loss of income for a specified period or permanently.&#13;
5.     Table 2.7.1 shows, in line with intemational norms, the trend in fatal and serious accidents in coal&#13;
mines expressed as frequency per 100,000 man shifts and 1000 persons employed, and also the fatality&#13;
rate per million tons of coal production. These statistics reveal that there has been an impressive decline in&#13;
&#13;

terms of fatality rates per 1000 persons. More recent statistics between 1986 and 1993 show that the rate&#13;
per 100,000 man shifts has not shown any improvement. The data would indicate that the accident rate&#13;
(per 1000 persons employed) for fatalities and serious injuries, has reached a plateau.&#13;
6.      Analysis of the causes of fatal accidents shows that roof/side falls at the production faces in&#13;
underground mines account for the largest number of accidents, followed by accidents caused by 'wheeled&#13;
trackless transportation equipment' in opencast mines and accidents caused by rope haulage and other&#13;
machinery. Although the fatalities from roof or side falls show a declining trend in absolute terms, they&#13;
still account for 42% of all fatal accidents. This shows clearly that greater attention needs to be paid to the&#13;
proper and adequate implementation of roof control measures, such as steel supports and 'roof bolting.'&#13;
7.      Table 2.7.2 presents data on safety in opencast mines between 1975 and 1993. Eighty percent of&#13;
accidents in opencast mines can be attributed to heavy earth moving equipment, and of those, about 75%&#13;
are caused by dump trucks and other transportation machinery. Nearly 90% of these accidents are ac-&#13;
counted for by negligent or unauthorized driving, unauthorized riding and being hit by vehicles while&#13;
reversing or while crossing haul roads. Many of these accidents could be prevented through proper train-&#13;
ing, provision of audiovisual signals during reversing of trucks and walkie-talkie sets to dumper operators&#13;
and spotters, adequate illumination after dark and in smog, improved wide angle visibility from the&#13;
driver's cabin and adequate maintenance of brakes. Far too many accidents are attributed to 'human error'&#13;
such as poor judgment, misinterpretation of signals, forgetfulness, misadventure and other foolhardiness&#13;
which underscore the imperative need for safety education and training for behavioral change.&#13;
8.      Table 2.7.3 presents an overview of major causes of accidents, the current efforts of the industry&#13;
in combating them and recommendations for a strategy to improve mine safety.&#13;
9.      International comparisons of mine safety need to be interpreted with some care for several rea-&#13;
sons. Definitions of 'serious injuries' vary from country to country; some countries express fatality or&#13;
injury rates in terms of man shifts worked, others in terms of man hours worked; there are also substantial&#13;
differences in the geo-mining conditions, extraction methods (longwall or bord and pillar), and the level of&#13;

training and experience of the work force. Accident profiles of European countries that employ predomi-&#13;
nantly the longwall system cannot be compared with bord and pillar systems in India because accidents&#13;
due to falls of roof have virtually been eliminated in longwall mining with the introduction of powered&#13;
supports for the last 30 years.&#13;
10.      In the Republic of South Africa, the rate is defined as the number of fatalities or injuries that have&#13;
occurred in one year among 1000 people 'at work', whereas in other countries it is 'on roll.' Such marked&#13;
differences in the statistical bases of computation of accident rates notwithstanding, it may be revealing to&#13;
compare the available fatality rates in different coal-producing countries of the world as presented in&#13;

favorably with most other major coal producing countries. Even though the fatality rate per million tons of&#13;
production may not be a valid measure of exposure to risk, Indian figures reveal that there is no room for&#13;
complacency.&#13;
11.      The background of mine workers in India and South Africa are similar. They come from  rural&#13;
backgrounds and do not have a long tradition as mine workers. Most of them are semi-literate. Table 2.7.5&#13;
presents a comparative picture of fatality and injury rates per 1000 mine workers in Indian and South&#13;
African coal industries. Even though there are some basic differences in the definition of injury rates in the&#13;
two countries, the Indian coal industry shows a higher safety record. In the state owned mines in China,&#13;
the average number of mine workers killed per million tons of coal production in 1980 was 4.53; this&#13;
figure has been brought down to 1.43 in 1990, as safety has been given a high priority by the Chinese&#13;
Government. For the Indian coal industry, the fatality rate per million tons in 1990 was 0.78 and in 1993&#13;
was 0.75.&#13;
Mine safety organization in the Indian coal industry&#13;
12.      There are currently three main routes through which safety in the coal mines is being promoted:&#13;
(a) the enforcement agency of the Government, (b) the coal industry's own safety organization and (c)&#13;
various promotional measures and initiatives. For administering the provisions of the Mines Act, the&#13;
Government of India has set up the Office of the Director General of Mines Safety (DGMS), which is the&#13;
principal enforcement agency. For improvement of safety in mines, a number of measures have been&#13;
taken. They include:&#13;

injury that either incapacitates the injured person from performing his normal or similar occupation&#13;
for a period of 14 days or more, or that causes the injured person to suffer the loss of a limb or part of&#13;
a limb, or sustain a permanent disability' is reportable. In India, 'any injury which involves or in all&#13;
probability will involve, the permanent loss of, or injury to, the sight or hearing of any person or any&#13;
permanent physical incapacity or the fracture of one or more joints or bones or any phalanges of hand&#13;

personnel, in cases where they have been negligent in the discharge of their duties; and&#13;
f)  prosecution of person(s) responsible for accidents.&#13;
13.   Besides overseeing compliance of existing legislation through inspections, inquiries into accidents&#13;
and dangerous occurrences and other safety promotional initiatives, the DGMS has also the responsibility&#13;
of according approval of mine safety equipment, materials and appliances; development of safety legisla-&#13;
tion and standards; and conduct of examinations for the grant of competency certificates to mine manag-&#13;
ers, engineers and supervisory staff. Among new initiatives launched by the DGMS are the more intense&#13;
inspection of accident prone mines and identification of corrective measures, extending technological&#13;
support through science and technology research and human resource development through structural&#13;
training at the newly opened Mines Safety and Health Academy under CMPDI at Ranchi.&#13;
14.   Coal India has a substantial safety organization integrated into the management structure. There&#13;
are also consultation and workers' participation through the twin instruments of Pit Safety Committee at&#13;
the mine level and the system of 'Workmen's Inspector'. At the subsidiary company level there are several&#13;
formal and ad-hoc tripartite committees which take stock of safety status on a regular basis. The Coal&#13;
India Safety Board, with representatives of management, workmen, DGMS and a nominee of the Ministry&#13;
of Coal, meets twice a year to review safety performance of the companies. There is additionally a stand-&#13;
ing committee on safety for Coal Mines which is an apex committee headed by the Union Minister for&#13;
Coal.&#13;
15.   The Internal Safety Organization of Coal India is the principal organ of the coal industry in matter&#13;
of safety. The thrust on safety is supported by the coal industry's massive program of training and retrain-&#13;
ing of supervisory staff and workmen. Besides the statutory initial, refresher and specialized training of&#13;
mine workers at vocational training centers, the coal industry has an extensive network of training institu-&#13;
tions, supervisory development institutes and mine management training centers.&#13;
16.   The training policy of Coal India aims to integrate occupational safety and health, and environ-&#13;
mental awareness in all human resource development activities. New training modules for basic training of&#13;
surface (opencast) and underground workers varying from 12 to 48 days have been finalized, they provide&#13;
a comprehensive training of new mine workers. Among other promotional initiatives for spreading the&#13;
safety movement, the industry conducts annual safety campaigns in different coalfields using wide range&#13;
of techniques to inculcate safety awareness among workers and to stimulate inter-colliery competition.&#13;
There are also first aid and mine rescue competitions held in different coalfield to recognize the impor-&#13;
tance of speed, efficiency and preparedness in the event of emergencies. While strenuous efforts are being&#13;
made to upgrade the work place safety, unless there is ability to identify current hazards and the skill to&#13;
productively deal with them, the goals for higher safety cannot be attained.&#13;
17.   Mine emergency plans have been prepared at all mines as required under Coal Mine Regulations.&#13;
Technical assistance will be provided under the proposed program to review and, if necessary, update&#13;
these plans.&#13;

Occupational health hazards&#13;
18.    As some 80% of all diseases are environment-induced, if safe water supplies and good sanitation&#13;
facilities could be provided, a large majority of the environment induced diseases could be prevented.&#13;
Section 19 of the Mines Act (1952) stipulates the provision of adequate quantities of cool and wholesome&#13;
drinking water close to the workplace, and Section 20 lays down the requirements for sanitary conve-&#13;
niences. Under Section 25, the diseases which have been notified as being connected with coal mining&#13;
operations pneumoconiosis is the major scourge that has blighted the coal miners.&#13;
19.    The Coal Mines Regulations (1957) stipulate that the permissible standard of respirable dust at&#13;
3mg/m3 of air for coal dust containing up to 5% free silica. Table 2.7.6 presents the statistics of coal&#13;
workers' pneumoconiosis between 1978 and 1991. The apparently increasing number of cases is not due&#13;
to actual incidence, but because of the introduction of statutory medical examination since 1978 and&#13;
greater awareness amongst the workers to avail of the new medical facilities since 1985. Special efforts&#13;
are currently underway for diagnosis of pneumoconiosis among coal workers through radiological screen-&#13;
ing at 60 centers in different subsidiaries of Coal India.&#13;
20.    Changing technology has introduced new hazards in the mine environment such as noise, toxico-&#13;
logical hazards and psychiatric problems. Noise, as a major health risk, has merited scrutiny in the coal&#13;
industry. Based on the ILO Code of Practice, the DGMS has recommended the following noise standards:&#13;
warning (action) level           85 dB(A)&#13;
danger limit for unprotected ears   90 dB(A)&#13;
entry only with ear protection   115 dB(A)&#13;
entry to be prohibited           140 dB(A)&#13;
Audiometry forms a part of mandatory medical examination for new entrants and for persons engaged in&#13;
operations/areas where noise level exceeds 90 dB(A). While noise surveys conducted in the coal mines&#13;
have confirmed that the noise problem is not a serious issue, medical examinations of mine workers&#13;

showed that slightly more than 50% of the workforce seems to have some degree of hearing impairment.&#13;
The cause is more likely the relatively high average age of underground workers than noise at the work-&#13;
place.&#13;
21.   Responsibilities for occupational health at the corporate level are shared by the Chief of Medical&#13;
Health Services, Coal India and the newly -created Institute of Occupational Medicine and Hygiene at&#13;
CMPDI, Ranchi. The roles of the Chief of Medical Health Services are to liaise with organizations of the&#13;
Central Government on national occupational health policy and to monitor the quality and implementation&#13;
of worker health programs in the subsidiary companies. The major responsibilities of the new CMPDI&#13;
institute will be to carry out extensive monitoring of worker health and maintain a medical data bank on&#13;
employees, to initiate long-term research into the health aspects of coal mining, and to provide advice and&#13;
consultancy services to coal companies on occupational health, industrial hygienic and ergonomics.&#13;
22.   An Occupational Health Wing, headed by a Deputy Chief Medical Officer, has been established at&#13;
the central hospital of each subsidiary company. The responsibility of these units is to provide regular&#13;
medical screenings and diagnostic examinations of company employees, to regularly report to company&#13;
management on the incidence of occupational diseases amongst mine workers, to train regional hospital&#13;
staff in the detection and treatment of occupational diseases, and to provide ongoing care for employees&#13;
requiring specialized treatment.&#13;
23.   All new entrants undergo a thorough medical check up before starting work. As per Mines Rules&#13;
about one-fifth of the employees are medically examined every year in rotation. Coal India has started a&#13;
computerized health record system, which will cover all employees by December 1996. Radiology,&#13;
cardiopulmonary, audiometry, ergonometry and psychiatric diagnostic capability will be strengthened at&#13;
both the corporate and subsidiary company levels.&#13;
Mine rescue program&#13;
24.   Subsequent to the assumption of mine rescue responsibilities by Coal India in 1985, two commis-&#13;
sions were established by the Government of India to review existing mine rescue facilities and to recom-&#13;
mend priorities for modemization rescue equipment. A comprehensive modemization plan for mine&#13;
rescue services has now been prepared and is being implemented based on the reports of these commis-&#13;
sions. Four new mine zonal rescue stations are being established and equipped, and the two existing&#13;
stations upgraded to the same standard. Training facilities are being built to provide a more realistic&#13;
simulation of the actual environment encountered in actual rescue and recovery work.&#13;
Welfare measures Coal India as an instrument for socio-economic change&#13;
25.   In the pre-nationalization era (1975), the were a number of enactments aimed at providing a&#13;
modicum of facilities for health, water supply and other amenities in the coalfields. For instance, the&#13;
Mines Boards of Health were set up in major coalfields as municipal agencies for managing the civic&#13;
affairs of urban centers in coalfields and also for providing support services for improving support services&#13;
for improving the living conditions. Starved of funds, the impacts of such organizations were very mar-&#13;
ginal. The Coal Mines Labor Welfare Fund Act (1947) set up the Coal Mines Labor Welfare Organization&#13;
to provide an umbrella organization for medical facilities. There was also a plethora of welfare-related&#13;
legislative measures for canteens, creates, pinhead baths, etc., but hardly any progress was made in the&#13;
implementation of these measures due to lack of support from the mine owners as well as lack of enthusi-&#13;
asm to utilize the facilities by the workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

26.     After the nationalization of coal mines, there has been a sea change in the level of funding and&#13;
resource inputs for miners' welfare through the creation of a massive social infrastructure with vastly&#13;
upgraded facilities for housing, water supply and medical care. Over the last two decades, Coal India has&#13;
built a large number of workers' housing colonies with facilities for schools and colleges, canteens,&#13;
recreational facilities such as playgrounds, stadiums and gymnasiums, etc.. Coal India's expenditure on&#13;
workers welfare has registered a steep increase from Rs 200 million (US$6.5 million) in 1974-75 to Rs&#13;
5,000 million (US$ 160 million) in 1992-93 reflecting the industry's commitment to welfare activities.&#13;

Annex 2.8 TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
This annex provides a brief description of the terms of reference for the major items included&#13;
under the technical assistance for this project:&#13;
1. Strengthening of Coal India's environmental and social management capacities&#13;
The objective of this task is to enhance Coal India's current capacity to deal effectively with the&#13;
environmental and social issues the company encounters in the operation and expansion of its mines. To&#13;
this end, a multi-disciplinary team of experts would work closely with Coal India's environmental and&#13;
social staff in a review of Coal India's current capabilities in these areas. Based on this review, the expert&#13;
team would then make recommendations to Coal India's management on how to enhance the effectiveness&#13;
of Coal India's environmental and social units. These recommendations would need to take into account&#13;
Indian laws and regulations, Coal India's respective policies, cultural factors and the experience with&#13;
similar efforts in India and abroad.&#13;
In its work the team would deal, inter alia, with the following issues:&#13;
*   the effectiveness of Coal India's current organizational setup,&#13;
*   the quality of Environmental Impact Assessments,&#13;
*   Coal India's capacity to deal with regional environmental and social issues,&#13;
*   the possibility of establishing corporate targets for pollution and waste reduction for areas&#13;
that are currently not covered by laws and regulations or exceed prevailing norms,&#13;
*   review the extent to which environmental and safety concerns are taken into account in mine&#13;
planning, equipment selection and mine operations,&#13;
*   auditing procedures,&#13;
*   staff training, and&#13;
*   consultations with the various stakeholders.&#13;
The team would need to include experts in the following areas:&#13;
*   sociology, resettlement and rehabilitation,&#13;
*   corporate environmental management,&#13;
*   mine planning and reclamation,&#13;
*   environmental impact assessment,&#13;
*   environmental monitoring,&#13;
*   GIS and computerized data management,&#13;
*   training and professional development programs, and&#13;
*   Indian environmental laws and regulations.&#13;
Coal India is expected to initiate the task within six months after the project becomes effective.&#13;
Completion of this task will take about 48 man-months, and is estimated to cost (including travel, office&#13;
support, etc.) US$775,000 of which US$590,000 would be in foreign exchange.&#13;
2. Study to assist power generation companies in ash disposal&#13;
The purpose of this task is to assist Coal India's power generation customers in efforts to find&#13;
environmentally acceptable and sustainable methods for ash disposal. To this end, Coal India (through&#13;
CMPDI) will assist their power generation customers in a study of the feasibility of disposing of ash in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 2.8&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
mined out areas. This study will build on the knowledge gained in previous studies conducted in concert&#13;
with the Indian power generation industry.&#13;
Coal India will research and make available to interested power corporations, the following&#13;
information:&#13;
*   potential mines for ash disposal;&#13;
*   battery limits for ash supply;&#13;
*   physical conditions of ash at supply point;&#13;
*   preferred mode of transport;&#13;
*   additional installations required at mine site to facilitate ash disposal;&#13;
*   estimated operating costs of ash disposal inside mine battery limit and cost of altemative&#13;
backfilling operations (if any); and&#13;
*   data on hydrological conditions at mine site and possible effect of ash leachate on under-&#13;
ground water quality.&#13;
Coal India's study team would include members with expertise in mining and civil engineering.&#13;
The schedule of this task will be determined by the power generation industry study leader.&#13;
Completion of this task will take about 10 man-months and is estimated to cost (including travel, office&#13;
support, etc.) US$17,000 which will include no foreign exchange.&#13;
3. Study to determine best methods for disposal of oil and grease from workshop effluents&#13;
The objective of this task is for Coal India to develop practical solutions to dispose of oil and&#13;
grease from workshop effluents in order to improve ambient water quality in and around the 25 mines&#13;
included in the project. To this end, CMPDI staff (with the aid of local consultants) will review domestic&#13;
and international regulations and study reports documenting procedures for the proper disposal of oil and&#13;
grease. CMPDI will contact other industries and oil and grease recycling organizations with India to&#13;
obtain information. The various disposal technologies identified will be analyzed for applicability to Coal&#13;
India mine operations. Options to be studied include collection of oil and grease in barrels for incineration&#13;
in a professionally designed unit and selling of oil and grease to downstream users for use as fuel. The&#13;
study will also investigate the most economic mode of treatment and disposal for effluent water, including&#13;
reuse inside the mine battery limits and treatment to reduce oil content.&#13;
The study team will include expertise in environmental engineering and/or waste management&#13;
engineering and appropriate administrative support. Completion of this task will take about 10 man-&#13;
months and is estimated to cost (including travel, office support, etc.) US$16,000 which will include no&#13;
foreign exchange.&#13;
4. Studies to determine the suitability of top soils for use in overburden dump reclamation&#13;
The objective of these studies is to characterize the soil horizons that will be removed at each of&#13;
the 25 mines in the project. Those soils found to be suitable for use in overburden dump biological recla-&#13;
mation can then be stored properly and reused. The major benefits of the study will be the development&#13;
and progressive improvement of the techniques used in biological reclamation overburden dumps and&#13;
more timely and effective reuse of mined out areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -&#13;
Annlexc 2.8&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
Coal India will hire local consultants with expertise in soil science and agronomy to characterize&#13;
the soil horizons that will be removed during mining operations at each of the 25 mines. The soils will be&#13;
analyzed for physical, chemical and biological parameters necessary for their use as suitable substrate for&#13;
overburden dump reclamation.&#13;
The studies will continue for five years as suitable soils are collected, stored and reused. Comple-&#13;
tion of the task will take about 20 man-months and is estimated to cost (including travel, office support,&#13;
etc.) US$34,000 which will include no foreign exchange.&#13;
5. Study to determine acceptability of septic field sewage disposal at mine colonies&#13;
Domestic sewage at most of the mine colonies is currently disposed through septic leach field&#13;
treatment (locally identified as 'soak pits'). World Bank staff have expressed concern that this treatment&#13;
technique might have an adverse impact on local ground and surface water resources if the leach field soils&#13;
are inadequate to provide proper treatment. Many of the colonies and surrounding villages depend upon&#13;
groundwater (wells) for domestic use, thus, inadequate sewage treatment and potential biocontamination&#13;
of groundwater might put these users at risk. Coal India has agreed to conduct a study at each of the mines&#13;
in the project where new leachfields are proposed in new or existing colonies. The major benefit of this&#13;
study will be the protection of the domestic water supplies of the mine colonies and nearby villages.&#13;
These studies will consist of soil borings and sampling to determine soil suitability for leach field&#13;
disposal. These studies will include a review of leachfield design to determine the adequacy of the&#13;
leachfield area, percolation rates, soil strata characteristics and proximity to groundwater resources. If&#13;
these studies determine that soil conditions at any of the sites are not suitable for septic system disposal,&#13;
the proper sewage treatment system will be designed and constructed to meet all Government discharge&#13;
standards.&#13;
The consultant study team would have expertise in sanitary and environmental engineering&#13;
specifically related to domestic sewage treatment. Completion of the task will take about 84 man-months&#13;
and is estimated to cost (including travel, office support, etc.) US$ 143,000 which will include no foreign&#13;
exchange.&#13;
6. Social Science Consultant to Resettlement and Rehabilitation Cell&#13;
The general objective of this consultancy is to add social science capacity and community devel-&#13;
opment and rural income generating experience to the R&amp;R Cell in Coal India, thereby ensuring that the&#13;
recently approved Coal India Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation is carried out effectively. This&#13;
additional capacity and experience will contribute to improved performance in resettlement and rehabilita-&#13;
tion work, resulting in better relations with surrounding communities and more prosperous communities.&#13;
Coal India intends to hire a consultant to assist in building the necessary capacity and human&#13;
infrastructure at the project, area and subsidiary levels for the implementation of the resettlement and&#13;
rehabilitation activities.&#13;
The responsibilities of the consultant, who would be attached to the R&amp;R Cell at Coal India&#13;
headquarters, would include:&#13;
*   assisting GM (R&amp;R), Coal India in identifying and selecting NGOs for assistance in imple-&#13;
menting the policy;&#13;

*   assisting the GM (R&amp;R), Coal India in organizing workshops and seminars for Coal India&#13;
staff and NGOs involved in R&amp;R implementation; and&#13;
*   identifying suitable research institutions, and drawing up Terms of References for studies&#13;
needed for improved implementation (e.g. market research, community studies, rapid&#13;
evaluation studies, etc.)&#13;
The successful candidate must have, educational background in social science, Sociology, Anthro-&#13;
pology or Social Welfare; practical experience in income generating/self employment activities in rural&#13;
India; and practical experience in two or more of the following areas: rural community development,&#13;
participatory training techniques, management and monitoring of rural development, evaluation and&#13;
research of rural development.&#13;
The consultant will be assigned to the R&amp;R Cell of Coal India for the entire project period.&#13;
Completion of the task will take about 60 man-months and is estimated to cost (including travel, office&#13;
support, etc.) US$102,000 which will include no foreign exchange.&#13;
7. Safety of overburden dumps&#13;
The objectives of this task are to determine the safety of the old overburden dumps of the 25&#13;
opencast mines included in the Bank's project and to design the resloping and regrading of unsafe over-&#13;
burden dumps. To this end, Coal India will form a study group with local consultants and perform a&#13;
comprehensive examination of the stability and safety of the overburden dumps and propose methods and&#13;
means for resloping any unsafe or unstable dumps. In addition, Coal India will review, with the help of&#13;
one local and one foreign consultant, the determination of the stability of overburden dumps and the&#13;
methodology for resloping and regrading recommended by the study group. The consultants and the study&#13;
group should include experts in civil engineering and mining engineering with relavent experience.&#13;
Coal India is expected to form the study group within one year of project effectiveness. Comple-&#13;
tion of the study will take 18 manmonths and is expected to cost US$52,000 (including travel, office&#13;
support, etc.) which will include no foreign exchange. The review of the results of the study will take&#13;
place within six months of the completion of the study and will take 4 manmonths. This task is expected to&#13;
cost US$45,000 (including travel, office support, etc.) of which US$40,000 will be foreign exchange.&#13;
8. Training for environmental personnel&#13;
The objective of this task is to ensure proper implementation of the Environmental Management&#13;
Plans and environmental legislation and compliance with consent letters. To this end, Coal India, with the&#13;
assistance of local consultants, will prepare training training modules for new recruits and refresher&#13;
courses for environmental personnel at all levels in Coal India and will train environmental personnel, as&#13;
well as personnel from other disciplines, at the National Institution and the staff college of Coal India.&#13;
Coal India is expected to initiate this task within six months after the project becomes effective.&#13;
Preparation of the training modules is expected to take 40 man months and is estimated to cost US$68,000&#13;
(including travel, local transport, etc.). The training is expected to continue for the entire project and will&#13;
take approximately 300 man months to complete. The estimated cost of the training is US$100,000. These&#13;
tasks will include no foreign exchange.&#13;

9. Standardization of environmental monitoring&#13;
The objectives of this task are to identify the areas of Coal India's environmental monitoring&#13;
system, to improve Coal India's current system of monitoring for compliance with environmental stan-&#13;
dards, and to reduce the air pollution and bring the suspended particulate matter within permissible limits.&#13;
To this end, Coal India, with the help of local consultants, will study the existing environmental monitor-&#13;
ing practices and develop standard procedures for application throughout Coal India. Coal India and the&#13;
local consultants will also identify colonies and villages affected by air pollution and formulate a mitiga-&#13;
tion plan for those communities.&#13;
Coal India is expected to initiate this task within six months after the project becomes effective.&#13;
The task is expected to take 34 man months and the cost is estimated at US$58,000 (including travel, local&#13;
transport, etc.) with no foreign exchange.&#13;
10. Facilitation of community participation in implementation of RAPs and IPDPs&#13;
The objective of this task is to pass on the maximum investment benefits of the Rehabilitation&#13;
Action Plans and Indigenous Peoples Development Plans to the local communities in the mine areas. In&#13;
order to achieve this, one or two NGOs or community based organizations at each of the 25 subprojects&#13;
will be selected to assist in organizing the communities so that they can participate in the activities in-&#13;
tended to improve their communities. The organization will provide assistance to aid community residents&#13;
in bidding for the contracts and implementing them. The consultants will need to be resident in the com-&#13;
munity.&#13;
The team will study the current status of implementation of Coal India's development programs.&#13;
They will also interact with the community to identify their needs and discuss those needs with mine&#13;
management to obtain management's financial support.&#13;
Coal India is expected to initiate this task within six months after the project becomes effective.&#13;
The task will continue for the entire project period. The total effort required is expected to be 3000&#13;
manmonths (50 groups of two or three people for 60 months) and the cost is estimated at US$1.42 million&#13;
with no foreign exchange.&#13;
11. Assessment of implementation of RAPs and recommendations for improvements&#13;
The objectives of this task are to identify shortcomings and successes in the implementation of&#13;
Rehabilitation Action Plans and Indigenous Peoples Development Plans, to disseminate information about&#13;
these successes and shortcomings, and to help management improve on the social development policies&#13;
and their implementation. In order to achieve these objectives, an independent social research organization&#13;
will visit mines and discuss with project-affected people and other to assess the results of the implementa-&#13;
tion of the resettlement and rehabilitation and community development policies. The organization will&#13;
identify positive and negative impacts, recommend ways to improve implementation, monitor the results&#13;
and submit semi-annual reports to Coal India. The organization will sample at least one mine in each&#13;
coalfield once a year.&#13;
Coal India is expected to initiate this task approximately one year after the project becomes&#13;
effective. The task will then continue for the remainder of the project period. The total effort required is&#13;
expected to be 50 manmonths and the cost is estimated at US$96,000 (including travel, field&#13;
accomodations, etc.).&#13;

12. Assistance in supervision of the project&#13;
The objective of this task is to assist the Bank in supervising the implementation of the project by&#13;
helping to focus the Bank's supervision missions on the subprojects with weaker records of implementa-&#13;
tion. To this end experienced local consultants will work with Coal India to visit each subproject at least&#13;
once in every quarter to review the adequacy of environmental and social policy implementation staff and&#13;
infrastructure facilities and the status of the implementation of the Environmental Action Plans, Rehabili-&#13;
tation Action Plans and Indigenous Peoples Development Plans.&#13;
The local consultants should have wide experience in mining project implementation and environ-&#13;
mental and social issues facing coalfield areas. The supervision team should consist of one senior mining&#13;
engineer, two environmental specialists and two sociologists.&#13;
Coal India is expected to initiate this task within six months after the project becomes effective.&#13;
The task will continue for the entire project period. The total effort required is expected to be 6,700 man&#13;
days and the cost is estimated at US$413,000 (including local travel, accommodations, overhead, etc.)&#13;
with no foreign exchange.&#13;
13. Midterm review of environmental policies&#13;
The objective of this task is to improve performance in environmental pollution control measures.&#13;
To this end, Coal India will work closely with two international and two Indian environmental consultants&#13;
to carry out a midterm review of Coal India's environmental policies and recommend measures to improve&#13;
them.&#13;
Coal India is expected to initiate this task about mid way through the implementation of the&#13;
project. The total effort required is expected to be 12 man months and the cost is estimated at US$ 143,000&#13;
(including travel, accommodations, etc.) which includes US$130,000 foreign exchange.&#13;
14. Social and environmental review panel&#13;
The Social Team will be guided by OD 4.30 and OD 4.20, the Resettlement Actions Plans and the&#13;
Indigenous Peoples Development Plans prepared by Coal India, meetings with relevant project staff and&#13;
project-affected people, and is expected to carry out the following activities (i) review Coal India's&#13;
resettlement and rehabilitation policy and the Resettlement Actions Plans, assess the progress Coal India is&#13;
making in implementing the policies and the Plans, including identifying areas where improvements are&#13;
needed and evaluate the extent to which restoration of project-affected people's livelihood is achieved; (ii)&#13;
review Coal India's policy statements on community development and tribal development in particular,&#13;
assess the progress Coal India is making in implementing the indigenous plans and evaluate the effects on&#13;
indigenous communities in the project area; (iii) review public health issues; (iv) meet with project-&#13;
affected people, NGOs and interested parties in major coal fields; and (iv) guide Coal India in the plan-&#13;
ning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of resettlement and community development programs.&#13;
The environmental team will be guided by the sectoral environmental assessment, Environmental&#13;
Action Plans, meeting with project teams and site visits. It will focus on environmental impacts related to&#13;
(i) air, water, land, noise and vibrations and (ii) coal mining environmental management.&#13;

Annex 2.9 COAL INDIA LTD.&#13;
India's coal industry&#13;
1.    About two-thirds of India's commercial energy demand is currently met by coal. India's large&#13;
reserves of coal would suffice to meet the projected demand for the next 250 years. Current production&#13;
(1995/96) is around 240 million. In terms of energy this would be equivalent to about 110 million tons of&#13;
oil, almost four times the quantity of India's indigenous oil production.&#13;
2.     About 60% of India's coal production is used in power generation; 15% is consumed in the&#13;
production of steel; the remaining 25% are used by a large number of industries, such as cement, fertiliz-&#13;
ers, brick kilns, textiles, paper, glass, ceramic and metallurgical plants; in addition, households, particu-&#13;
larly those located in close proximity of coal mining areas, consume large quantities of soft coking coal;&#13;
about 300,000 tons of coal are exported to Bangladesh.&#13;
3.     The pattern of coal consumption has changed over time in response to changes in the direction of&#13;
India's industrial and economic growth:&#13;
*   Until the 1960's, the Indian Railways were the largest user of coal. Replacement of steam&#13;
locomotives with diesel and electric locomotives sharply reduced the use of coal by the&#13;
railways.&#13;
*   With the emphasis on the development of core industries and the commissioning of large&#13;
integrated steel plants, the steel industry began to take the lead as the largest user of coal.&#13;
The demand for coal by the steel industry continued to grow until the end of the 1970's. By&#13;
then, the coal industry had reached its capacity of producing prime grade coking coal. The&#13;
steel industry had to rely on imported coking coal, which was usually mixed with lower&#13;
grades of indigenous coking coal, to meet its coal requirements.&#13;
a   The boom in the demand of coal in the 1 970s was fueled by two important policy decisions&#13;
of the Government: one, to speed up the country's development though investments in heavy&#13;
industries, and two, to ensure 'equitable growth of all regions in India'. Both policies gave&#13;
rise to a dramatic increase in India's industrial base in almost all States. While the decision&#13;
to spread industrial development over wide area achieved the desired effect of creating&#13;
employment, poor access to rail and road transport made electric power the only alternative&#13;
for most industrial plants to meet their energy needs.&#13;
*   Along with the push to accelerate industrial growth, came pressures to protect India's&#13;
farmers from the 'vagaries' of the monsoon and to provide urban (as well as rural) house-&#13;
holds with access to electric power. The 'drought-proofing' of agriculture led to a surge in&#13;
the demand for subsidized credits (to finance tubwells, pumps and other agricultural machin-&#13;
ery) and subsidized power (to run all this machinery).&#13;
4.    Initially, the Government tried to meet the growing demand for electric power from hydroelectric&#13;
power. However, the relatively long construction periods of hydroelectric power plants, riparian disputes,&#13;
increasing difficulties in the resettlement of people and growing environmental concerns shifted the&#13;
balance steadily to investments in coal-based thermal power plants. Currently, about 60% of coal produc-&#13;
tion is consumed by the power sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 2.9&#13;

Nationalization of the coal industry&#13;
5.    Until the early 1 970s coal production was mostly in the hands of privately owned mining compa-&#13;
nies. Easy access to high quality coal and the availability of inexpensive labor attracted a large number of&#13;
relatively small investors. Apart from the usual lease arrangements that entitled a company to mine coal in&#13;
a certain area, neither State nor the central governments exercised control over the industry. With the&#13;
dramatic growth in the demand for power and the expansion of coal-based thermal power generation, the&#13;
Government became concemed about the willingness and ability of the large number of private mine&#13;
owners to expand their operations. Two factors made private mine owners reluctant to make further&#13;
investments: one, was the possibility that the Government might nationalize their industry; and two, the&#13;
fact that coal prices were set by the Government at levels that barely covered costs. (The Government&#13;
controlled coal prices and the distribution of coal since 1939 as part of its efforts to meet the wartime&#13;
needs of the country.) The resulting decline in investments led to a drop in mine productivity; the squeeze&#13;
on profits, in turn, encouraged mine owners to 'cut corners'; the results were appalling labor conditions&#13;
and a disregard of sound mining practices in favor of short-term profits.&#13;
6.    To deal with the deteriorating situation, the Government decided in 1971 to nationalize all mines&#13;
producing coking coal, and in 1973, all mines producing thermal coal. Almost 1000 privately-owned&#13;
mines were combined into 325 mines and placed under the control of the Coal Mines Authority Ltd.&#13;
Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. continued to manage the mines of the Jahria coalfield, India's major source of&#13;
prime coking coal. The Government did not nationalize the 'captive' mines belonging to the TISCO and&#13;
IISCO steel companies, and it decided to share the ownership of Singareni Collieries Co. Ltd. (SCCL) the&#13;
Govemment of Andra Pradesh.&#13;
7.    In 1975, the Government consolidated its control over the industry by transferring the ownership&#13;
and management of all coal mines to Coal India Ltd., which was established for this purpose. Through its&#13;
seven (coal-producing) subsidiary companies, Coal India controls now more than 90% of India's coal&#13;
production. Lignite production, which amounts to about nine million tons, is in the hands of the Govem-&#13;
ment-owned Neyveli Lignite Corporation, an integrated producer of lignite, power, fertilizer and bri-&#13;
quettes (Figure 2.9.1).&#13;
Institutional structure and management of the sector&#13;
8.    THE ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT. Through the Department of Coal (DOC) in the Ministry of Coal&#13;
(MOC), the Planning Commission and the Public Investment Board, the Govenmment controls nearly all&#13;
facets of Coal India's operations. It sets production targets, approves operating budgets, decides on the&#13;
allocation of coal supplies to major consumers, coal prices, the investment program, new projects, wages&#13;
and the appointments of senior staff.&#13;
9.    TIIE ROLE OF COAL INDIA. Coal India Ltd. is the apex holding company of the nationalized coal&#13;
industry It is fully owned by the Government. Important management decisions are taken by a Board of&#13;
Directors, which consists of three directors (Director (Technical), Director (Finance) and Director (Person-&#13;
nel), two senior civil servants from the Ministry of Coal, one member each from Railway Board and the&#13;
Central Electricity Authority, the Chairmen-cum-Managing Directors from the subsidiary companies, and&#13;
one or two well known management experts. The Chairman of Coal India chairs the Board meetings.&#13;
(Figure 2.9.2 shows the basic organizational structure of Coal India and its subsidaries. ) Board members&#13;
are selected by the Government and appointed by the President of India. They serve at the pleasure of the&#13;
President and retire upon attaining the age of 58.&#13;

11.   Today Coal India has 450 mines and 15 washeries in production and 48 new mines and four new&#13;
washeries under construction. In addition, Coal India has five major central workshops equipped to&#13;
undertake all major repair and overhaul of mining equipment and to manufacture spare parts. The total&#13;
production from all mines in 1994/95 was 220 million tons of raw coal and [...] million tons of washed&#13;
coking coal. Coal India employed 656,000 people. Coal India's headquarters is located in Calcutta, which&#13;
is also the headquarters of the two principal railway networks that handle more than 70% of India's coal&#13;
shipments. Coal India maintains offices in Delhi and in almost all state capitals for liaison with Govem-&#13;
ment agencies and for monitoring distribution of coal. It has a staff of 1,600 and an annual budget of Rsl .8&#13;
billion (US$60 million).&#13;
12.   THE ROLE OF THE SUBSIDIARY COAL COMPANIES. When Coal India was established in 1975, the&#13;
nationalized coal mines were managed by four coal producing subsidiaries: Eastern Coalfields Ltd. (ECL)&#13;
in West Bengal, Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. (BCCL) and Central Coalfields Ltd. (CCL) both located in Bihar&#13;
and Westem Coalfields Ltd. (WCL) in Maharashtra. A few small mines in northeast India were managed&#13;
directly By Coal India. Mine planning and design was carried out in a separate subsidiary company, the&#13;
Central Mine Planning and Design Institute Ltd. (CMPDI) located in Ranchi. Mining operations extended&#13;
over eight States and 18 coalfields. All of them located in the east-central part of India.&#13;
13.   With the steep increase in coal production, it became increasingly difficult to manage widely&#13;
dispersed mining operations and Coal India created new subsidiaries with fewer mines. Major coalfields&#13;
became the main operating area of a subsidiary. Northern Coalfields Ltd. (NCL) in Singrauli and South-&#13;
eastern Coalfields Ltd. (SECL) in Central India and Korba were established in 1986 by splitting the&#13;
operations of CCL and WCL. Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. (MCL), which manages now the mines in the&#13;
Talcher coal field and Ib Valley was started in 1992 by reducing the areas of CCL and SECL.&#13;
14.   Each subsidiary coal company is managed by a Board of Directors with a Chairman-cum-Manag-&#13;
ing Director as the Chief Executive, who reports to the Chairman, Coal India. He is assisted by four full-&#13;
time and 4-5 part-time Directors that deal with production-related matters, the implementation of new&#13;
projects, finance matters and personnel issues. The 'functional' directors report to the respective Coal&#13;
India Directors on subject-related issues, but are placed administratively under their respective Chairman-&#13;
cum-Managing Directors. The 4-5 part-time directors represent the Ministry of Coal, the local railways,&#13;
local State Electricity Boards, Coal India and provide advice on management-related issues. All directors&#13;
are nominated by the Government.&#13;
15.   The main functions of the subsidiary companies are:&#13;
*   to manage all mining and other operations under their control and to conduct mining opera-&#13;
tions with due regard to safety of life and property, conservation of resources, and the&#13;
workers' health and welfare;&#13;
*   to sell coal and realize the sale proceeds, royalties, cesses and taxes on behalf of the Govern-&#13;
ment;&#13;
*   to manage all daily and monthly rated non-executive cadres;&#13;
*   to acquire land with due process of law and to attend to resettlement and rehabilitation and&#13;
environmental issues;&#13;
*   to liaise with local trade unions to maintain harmonious industrial relations;&#13;
*   to liaise with the representatives of State Governments, the Railways and Electricity Boards;&#13;
*   to approve projects with a capital investment of up to Rs200 million (US$6 million), and to&#13;
implement, monitor and review the progress of all investment projects and submit periodic&#13;
reports to Coal India;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

*   to effect payment of wages and salaries to all employees, and the bills of contractors; and&#13;
*   to procure all capital and consumable goods (other than those procured by Coal India) and to&#13;
supervise their efficient distribution and storage.&#13;
16.    Subsidiary companies have three levels of management: Corporate level, area level and Mine level&#13;
management. Each company is divided into a number of areas and each area has a number of operating&#13;
mines and projects under implementation. The number of areas in a company varies from five in MCL to&#13;
18 in BCCL depending on the number of mines or project units, the type and complexity of the operations,&#13;
and the manpower deployed. Larger mines or projects are often treated as an 'area'.&#13;
17.   AREA MANAGEMENT. Each area is managed by an Area General Manager, usually a mining engi-&#13;
neer with about 25 years of operational experience. He is assisted by a team of 10-12 engineers and other&#13;
professional staff. They are responsible for the supervision and monitoring of all activities at the mine or&#13;
project level. The Area office is also in charge of land acquisition and the implementation of Coal India's&#13;
policy for resettlement and rehabilitation as well as its corporate environmental policy. The Area General&#13;
Manager reports to the functional directors on the respective functions, but administratively he is answer-&#13;
able to the chairnan of the subsidiary company.&#13;
18.    MINE MANAGEMENT. Producing mines and mines under construction ('projects') are managed by&#13;
Mine or Project Managers, usually mining engineers with 15-20 years experience. He is the linchpin for&#13;
all production and project implementation activities. Each manager is assisted by a Pit Manager and a&#13;
number of assistants and undermanagers, all of them mining engineers. Their number is determined by&#13;
Coal Mines regulations and varies with the volume of production and the complexity of the operations. In&#13;
addition, each Mine Manager is assisted by a number of other professionals that assist him in matters such&#13;
as the implementation of environmental and rehabilitation action plans.&#13;
Financial management&#13;
Financial flows&#13;
19.   The financial flows between Coal India and its eight subsidiaries are akin to the practice followed&#13;
by a corporation whose operations are structured in divisions. One of Coal India's main finctions is to&#13;
transfer resources from profitable subsidiaries, such as MCL, NCL and SECL and marginally profitable&#13;
companies such as CCL, WCL to the two major loss-making companies, ECL and BCCL. This transfer of&#13;
resources is one of the main informal functions of the holding company, Coal India Ltd. While this cross-&#13;
subsidization of subsidiaries saps profitable companies of resources to expand their operations, it drasti-&#13;
cally reduces the overall tax burden on Coal India and its subsidiaries.&#13;
20.    The following practices have been used to determine, regulate and manage the financial flows&#13;
between subsidiary companies and Coal India.&#13;
a   A retention price mechanism is in operation among the coal producing companies. The&#13;
Ministry of Coal specifies the retention price applicable for each subsidiary coal company.&#13;
This price is below that realized by the profit-making companies and higher than that of loss-&#13;
making companies. Profit-making companies are therefore required to contribute the excess&#13;
of the realized price over retention price on the total outside coal dispatches to the Coal Price&#13;
Regulation Account (CPRA) which is maintained centrally by Coal India. The aggregate of&#13;
these credits are then used to settle the claims of the loss-making subsidiaries under the&#13;
scheme. The contributions to, or claims against, the CPRA are regarded as tax deductible&#13;

Coal India's financial performance&#13;
Financial performance of Coal India and its subsidiaries&#13;
22.    The Govemment's primary objective for nationalizing the coal industry was to rapidly expand&#13;
India's capacity to produce coal. Initially, Coal India's main function was to serve as a conduit for massive&#13;
public investments to the coal sector. The primary objective of these investments was to accelerate the&#13;
expansion of India's capacity to produce coal. Investment decisions were driven primarily by domestic&#13;
demand and by technical and geo-mining conditions. The financial performance of these investments was&#13;
of little concem. As a result, Coal India has accumulated a huge portfolio of unprofitable mining projects&#13;
which are supported by an elaborate system of cross-subsidization. (Figure 2.9.3 shows the profits/losses&#13;
of each Coal India's mines. It illustrates the concentration of profits in opencast mines. )&#13;
23.    Two additional factors contributed to the persistent decline of Coal India's financial performance:&#13;
*    Coal miners were regarded by Government as having been neglected by the previous private&#13;
owners. To compensate them, a wage policy that ensured miners real wage increases was&#13;
adopted and perpetuated without any reference to the increases in productivity and effi-&#13;
ciency; and&#13;

In response to the perceived necessity to provide energy as cheaply as possible to the&#13;
economy, the Government controlled prices at levels below average costs. The coal industry&#13;
was regarded as a public utility whose sole function was to provide a service to the rest of&#13;
the economy.&#13;
24.    Consequently Coal India incurred losses right from its inception. Because financial retums as-&#13;
sumed a low priority in the Government's investment strategy, the stage was set for a prolonged period of&#13;
rising losses and increasing dependence on the Government for funds to finance investments and cash&#13;
losses. While Coal India has achieved modest profits (rising from US$17.3 in 1989 to US$104 million in&#13;
1994), the financial performance for a company with total assets of US$4.8 billion (and equity of US$1.8&#13;
billion) remains weak.&#13;
25.    REFORM OF THE COAL INDUSTRY. In light of India's dependence on indigenous coal to meet its&#13;
energy needs in the short and medium term, persistent pressures on budgetary resources and a limited&#13;
capacity to import coal or other fuels due to capacity constraints in the existing transport infrastructure, the&#13;
Government and Coal India have no choice but to implement reforms that would enable the Indian coal&#13;
industry to operate on the basis of commercial considerations. Coal industries in other countries have&#13;
undergone similar reforms. Experience with these reforms has shown that this transformation will be&#13;
costly and take considerable time. The closure of uneconomic mines and the retrenchment of surplus labor&#13;
represent by far the most serious obstacle to the smooth implementation of reforms. The Government and&#13;
Coal India have therefore agreed on a reform strategy that would ensure that Coal India would&#13;
*   invest only in the most profitable mining operations;&#13;
*   phase out its subsidies to loss-making operations over a 5-7 year period;&#13;
-   'outsource' all activities that can be obtained cheaper from other companies;&#13;
-   improve the quality of its coal supplies;&#13;
-   make its operations environmentally and social sustainable.&#13;
The Government, on the other hand, would withdraw from the day-to-day management of the industry and&#13;
instead encourage the development of a competitive coal market:&#13;
-   coal pricing and distribution would be deregulated;&#13;
*   import tariffs would be reduced to a level where Coal India has no longer any effective&#13;
protection from tariffs; and&#13;
*   investments in the coal industry would be opened to private investors.&#13;
Once sufficient progress has been made in establishing an appropriate policy environment as well as in&#13;
closure of uneconomic mines and the retrenchment of surplus labor, the focus of the strategy would shift&#13;
towards creating a fully competitive market for coal in India by breaking-up Coal India into independent&#13;
coal companies that could be privatized and would compete against each other. At this stage, breaking up&#13;
Coal India would be counterproductive, since the holding company serves as the main conduit for the&#13;
implementation of reforms aimed at converting subsidiaries into commercially viable coal companies.&#13;

Annex 3.1 PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Origin of the project&#13;
1.    Following the foreign exchange and budget crisis in 1991 the Government of India decided to&#13;
phase out its financial support to several public sector enterprises, including Coal India. Faced with&#13;
dwindling financial support from the Government, Coal India's management decided to put the operation&#13;
of its mines on a sound commercial footing, phase out loss-making operations, reduce surplus labor and&#13;
reduce 'receivables' from major coal consumers. Many of these steps are politically sensitive. Therefore,&#13;
the Government decided to implement these changes gradually, and to accept that it would take some time&#13;
before they had a significant impact on Coal India's financial performance. During this period, Coal India&#13;
estimates that it would need annual financial support of about US$200-250 million to finance its invest-&#13;
ment requirements of about US$800-1000 million a year. In January 1993, the Government approached&#13;
the Bank with a request to support Coal India's efforts to commercialize its operations.&#13;
2.    Coal India and the Bank agreed that the most effective way to assist Coal India would be by&#13;
financing a time-slice of Coal's investments. In line with Coal India's short-term financial objectives, the&#13;
Bank's financial support would be limited to investments in highly profitable mines that are economically&#13;
viable, have no major environmental problems and require the least number of people to be resettled.&#13;
Twenty-five opencast mines that met these criteria were identified. In the course of project preparation, an&#13;
agreement was reached with the Government on a reform program for the coal industry. Under the Coal&#13;
Sector Rehabilitation Project, as it was originally proposed, Coal India was to receive IDA financing for&#13;
remedial and mitigating actions to bring the selected mines in line with the requirements of Indian laws&#13;
and regulations and the Bank's Operational Directives. In May 1995, the Loan Committee, while review-&#13;
ing the status of the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project, came to the conclusion that environmental and&#13;
social components of the project should be packaged as a separate Environment and Social Mitigation&#13;
Project. The Government and Coal India agreed to the proposal in November, 1995.&#13;
Project description&#13;
3.    The project consists of:&#13;
a)  the implementation of the Environmental Action Plans (EAPs), Rehabilitation Actions Plans&#13;
(RAPs) and Indigenous Peoples Development Plans (IPDPs) for 25 opencast mines of Coal&#13;
India that are slated to receive financial assistance under the proposed Coal Sector Rehabili-&#13;
tation Project (Investment component);&#13;
b)  technical assistance to enhance Coal India's capacity to effectively deal with environmental&#13;
and social issues of coal mining operations (Capacity building component); and&#13;
c)  a review (and if required, remedial action) of the resettlement and rehabilitation measures&#13;
taken by Coal India in implementing projects that have received Bank support in the past&#13;
(Social remedial action component).&#13;
Environmental Action Plans (EAPs)&#13;
4.    Since 1986, the Ministry of Environment and Forest has required preparation and submission of&#13;
Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) for investments in new coal mines or increases in production at&#13;
existing mines. Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) are an integral part of the EMPs. They include&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 112-&#13;
Annex 3.1&#13;
Page 2 of 27&#13;
prevention and mitigation measures for air, water, noise and vibration pollution; land reclamation; and&#13;
waste disposal; and improvements in the environment and safety of the workplace. If the acquisition of&#13;
forest land is involved, a forest clearance is also required.&#13;
5.    Coal India's EMPs meet most of the requirements of the Bank's OD 4.01. Areas not dealt in the&#13;
EMPs, such as environmental policy, environmental law, institutional arrangements, occupational health&#13;
and safety and public consultation, have been addressed in the Environmental and Social Impact Assess-&#13;
ment. In line with their commitment to self-police compliance with environmental laws and regulations,&#13;
Coal India has reviewed the status of compliance with environmental approvals, consent letters, etc. for&#13;
the 25 mines selected for the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project. To the extent that mines were not in&#13;
compliance with the environmental requirements issued by Indian authorities or the Bank's OD 4.01, they&#13;
prepared EAPs that would bring them into full compliance over the implementation period of the proposed&#13;
Coal India Environmental and Social Mitigation Project. Each of the EAPs contains a time-bound action&#13;
program and brief descriptions of the environmental issues and mitigation actions. The EAPs for the&#13;
selected 25 mines have been included in the Environmental Impact Assessment of the Indian Coal Sector&#13;
(May 1995) prepared by Coal India. Table 3.1.1 provides a synopsis of the main environmental issues and&#13;
mitigating actions that will be part of the proposed project.&#13;
Rehabilitation Action Plans (RAPs)&#13;
6.    Coal India is finding it increasingly difficult to acquire land for the expansion of existing mines.&#13;
To minimize the adverse effects of their mining operations, Coal India is changing the design of new&#13;
mines and has adopted a new resettlement and rehabilitation policy to ensure that all project-affected&#13;
people are compensated for their losses. Coal India has also intensified its community development&#13;
program which aims to improve the living conditions in villages adjacent to its mining operations and is&#13;
strengthening its organizational structure to ensure effective implementation of these policies.&#13;
7.    Coal India has estimated that it will have to acquire 322ha of new land during the implementation&#13;
of the project in the selected 25 mines. At the same time it will have to physically take into possession&#13;
1,387ha of land that it has already legally acquired and paid for. It has been the practice in Coal India to&#13;
legally acquire all land required for a new mine project before the mining operations start. Though the land&#13;
and homestead losers are legally compensated at that time, but the people are not evicted until such time&#13;
the land is required for mining operations.&#13;
8.    In identifying the number of project-affected people, Coal India relied initially on estimates&#13;
prepared by mine managers. Since families were the unit of entitlement for compensation of the loss of&#13;
land in guidelines provided by the States and the policies issued by the Ministry of Coal, mine managers&#13;
provided the data in terms of families. In addition, data was only provided for families affected by land&#13;
acquisition in the course of project implementation. No count was taken of families whose land had been&#13;
acquired earlier and who continued to cultivate (and in some instances live on) this land with the permis-&#13;
sion of the coal company.&#13;
9.    The revision of Coal India's policy for resettlement and rehabilitation in April 1994 changed the&#13;
definition and categories of project-affected people and the data collected earlier had to be re-estimated.&#13;
Subsidiary coal companies hired consultants, NGOs and research organisations to carry out socio-eco-&#13;
nomic baseline surveys and censuses of the project-affected persons.&#13;

10.    The base line survey conducted by various NGOs established that only 14 of the 25 mines involve&#13;
resettlement and/or rehabilitation issues. Detailed Rehabilitation Action Plans were prepared for these&#13;
fourteen subprojects in 1994. Coal India prepared addenda to these Rehabilitation Action Plans in January&#13;
1996. These addenda contain updated resettlement and rehabilitation figures for each of the 14 mines as&#13;
well as detailed implementation plans for each of the mines. In the 14 subprojects, a total of 17,632 people&#13;
will be adversely affected in the period from 1996 to 2005. During the project period (1996 to 2001) the&#13;
total number of people adversely affected will be 16,310. Overall, 10,445 people will lose their houses and&#13;
will have to be physically resettled during the implementation of the project. The majority of project-&#13;
affected people (11,985 people) are located in the Talcher and lb coalfields of Orissa. Overall, 9,260&#13;
people will be entitled to rehabilitation assistance during project period.&#13;
11.    Table 3.1.2 and 3.1.3 provide an overview of the number of people affected in the mines selected&#13;
for financial support under the proposed Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project. An overview of project-&#13;
affected people over 18 years of age and classified according to the Coal India policy of entitlements is&#13;
provided in Table 3.1.4. This table shows that 2,572 landless people who would not have been entitled to&#13;
assistance under previous guidelines, are now entitled to rehabilitation assistance. Table 3.1.5 outline the&#13;
corresponding rehabilitation action.&#13;
12.    A sumniary of the Rehabilitation Action Plans is provided in Table 3.1.5. For the project period, a&#13;
total of 9,260 persons are entitled to rehabilitation assistance. The provision of jobs with the coal company&#13;
and contractors is planned to rehabilitate 1,711 people (18%) and 7,549 people (82%) will be entitled to&#13;
assistance for self-employment. Some people may decline the offer for reasons such as old age or because&#13;
they are married to persons employed by the coal company; this will be determined in the process of&#13;

implementing the RAPs. If the rehabilitation entitlement had been provided under the previous guidelines,&#13;
each family, generally, would have been given one employment opportunity. All male and female persons&#13;
between the age 18 to 60 are entitled to rehabilitation assistance.&#13;
13.     About 25% of the project-affected people (3,999 people) are classified as tribals and an almost&#13;
equal number are classified as scheduled castes. This covers a large variation, from three mines with no&#13;
tribal persons to one mine where 100% (456 persons) are classified as tribals (Jhingurdah). In Madhya&#13;
Pradesh the five SECL mines with residual resettlement and rehabilitation issues proposed for inclusion in&#13;
the project have a tribal population varying from 2% to 92% of the project-affected population. Similarly&#13;
in Bihar, the two CCL mines with residual resettlement and rehabilitation issues proposed for the project&#13;
have tribal populations of 77% and 47% of the total number of project-affected people.With the exception&#13;
of Jhinguradah mine in Singrauli, the tribal people live with non-tribals in mixed villages, speak the same&#13;
local language and are economically integrated. They are engaged in agriculture in fixed plots of land or&#13;
persue crafts related to agriculture. All of them have been in contact with coal mining operations for more&#13;
than 20-30 years and many are employed in the mines. In Madhya Pradesh, tribals constitute majority of&#13;
the unskilled and semi-skilled workforce and have been so far more than 20 years. The effects of coal&#13;
rnining on tribal community are discussed in Annex 2.3.&#13;
14.     Resettlement and rehabilitation of project-affected people are guided by Coal India's Resettlement&#13;
and Rehabilitation Policy of 1994 (Annex 2.4). This policy supersedes various earlier policies and prac-&#13;
tices followed by different subsidiaries for the resettlement and rehabilitation of project-affected people.&#13;
15.     The RAPs have been prepared by NGOs on the basis of visits to the households of project-affected&#13;
people and on surveys which contained questions regarding affected people's perceptions of the issues&#13;

related to land acquisition, compensations, benefits from the mine projects causing their displacement,&#13;

RAPs for the selected 25 mines.&#13;
Indigenous Peoples Development Plans (IPDPs)&#13;
16.    Most of the mines that have been selected for financial support under the Coal Sector Rehabilita-&#13;
tion Project are in large coalfields where mining operations have taken place for several decades. Before&#13;
Coal India began to develop the coal deposits in these areas, the inhabitants subsisted on agricultural&#13;
activities and the gathering of forest produce. They had little contact with the 'outside world,' and what-&#13;
ever goods they needed they obtained through barter. The construction of coal mines led to a drastic&#13;
change in their lifestyles:&#13;
*    With the opening of coal mines came an influx of 'outsiders' (company officials, skilled&#13;
laborers, contractors with work teams and a host of small businesses to serve these groups),&#13;
who had little contact with the local population.&#13;
*    Land acquisition by the coal company and other industries that moved into the area because&#13;
of the ample supply of energy (power stations, smelters and other coal-based industries, as&#13;
well as industries that provided services to these industries, such as transport contractors,&#13;
ancillary industries and service facilities) reduced the opportunities for farming and forest-&#13;
based activities. This had two distinct effects: an increasing number of households became&#13;
economically dependent on employment in the industries that had sprung up in the area and&#13;
since these industries employed predominantly men, women (who had traditionally worked&#13;
beside men in agriculture) found themselves without employment and income.&#13;

*    With the shift from subsistence agriculture to industrial employment came the shift from&#13;
barter to money as the main means of trade.&#13;
*    The decline in agriculture and forest-related activities led to the emergence of new social&#13;
structures in the communities. More specifically, there was a growing income gap between&#13;
those employed in the local industries and those still dependent on subsistence agriculture.&#13;
17.    The ultimate objective of Coal India's community development policy (Annex 2.5) is to mitigate&#13;
the adverse effects of the construction of coal mines on existing communities in the area. The immediate&#13;
objective is to assist these communities to create, revive and maintain relevant and functioning community&#13;
assets, institutions and services that can improve their choices and living standard in the 'modem' world,&#13;
and at the same time, maintain and develop traditional ways of living and social ties of the communities.&#13;
18.    Coal India's policy aims to protect the weaker sections such as scheduled tribes, scheduled castes,&#13;
women, etc, while not overlooking the needs of others. In the tribal villages (there are not many), the&#13;
community as a whole will derive the benefits. The plan will help to build infrastructures for health,&#13;
education, economic development and to help revive their cultural life style.&#13;
19.     Coal India engaged several NGOs and specialized local agencies to study the developmental needs&#13;
of the communities living in the vicinity (lkm from the mining leasehold) of the 25 selected mines. The&#13;
study covered 189 villages with a population total of about 186,000 people. Of these, 30% belong to&#13;
scheduled tribes and an equal proportion to scheduled castes. It also includes settlements of people who&#13;
have come from outside the region in search ofjobs or business. See Table 3.1.6 for an overview of the&#13;
Indigenous Peoples Development Plans.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 3.1&#13;
Page 21 of 27&#13;
20.     The study shows that the main needs of the communities are the construction of approach roads,&#13;
water supply facilities, afforestation and revegetation for fire wood and grazing, health clinics, communal&#13;
latrines, schools, and access to electric power. Implementation of the IPDPs at the 25 selected mines will&#13;
cost about US$3.9 million. Table 3.1.1 provides a synopsis of the main elements of the IPDPs and the kind&#13;
of facilities that will be constructed under the IPDP.&#13;
21.     While the expense per mine appears to be relatively small, Coal India cannot limit the implemen-&#13;
tation of these facilities to the selected 25 mines that will be included in the proposed Coal Sector Reha-&#13;
bilitation Project. Communities of the neighboring mines will demand access to similar facilities. This will&#13;
significantly raise the cost of the implementation of the Community Development Policy. In addition, the&#13;
communities will turn to Coal India if they need maintenance or repairs of these facilities. Ideally, the&#13;
community should take responsibility for operating and maintaining these facilities. However, this re-&#13;
quires an organization and a regular source of funds. Village panchayets are not yet properly organized&#13;
and they have only limited sources of revenue.&#13;

Technical Assistance&#13;
22.   Coal India is aware of shortcomings in the implemental of environmental pollution control mea-&#13;
sures, and social mitigation measures. Technical assistance would greatly enhance the chance that projects&#13;
are implemented properly, on time and in accordance with its environmental and social policy objectives.&#13;
Therefore, the project contains a number of technical assistance programs to remedy these deficiencies.&#13;
23.   Table 3.1.7 provides an overview of the technical assistance that would be provided under the&#13;
proposed project. More detailed terms of reference for the various technical assistance tasks are provided&#13;
in Annex 2.8.&#13;
Social remedial action component&#13;
24.   This component would provide funds for the preparation and implementation of social remedial&#13;
action programs for the four coal mine projects which have received Bank support in the past (Dudhichua&#13;
Coal Project [Loan 2393-IN], which provided financial assistance for the development of the Dudhichua&#13;
opencast mine, the Jharia Coking Coal Project [Loan 2498-IN], which provided financial assistance for the&#13;
development of the Jharia Block II opencast mine and the Pootkee-Bulliary underground mine and the&#13;
Coal Mining Coal Quality Improvement Project, which provided financial assistance for the expansion of&#13;
the Gevra opencast mine and the development of the Sonepur-Bazari opencast mine.) The Bank's support&#13;
to the development of the Pootkee-Bulliary mine was canceled, and the resettlement under the Sonepur-&#13;
Bazari mine has yet to commence. (Eastern Coalfields Ltd. has prepared a Resettlement Action Plan for&#13;
this mine, which has been reviewed by the Bank and found to be satisfactory.)&#13;
25.   Land acquisition for the three remaining opencast projects led to the resettlement of about 18,700&#13;
persons. Resettlement of project-affected persons under the Dudhichua and Gevra opencast projects has&#13;
been completed; while the resettlement sites for the Jharia coking coal project have been constructed, a&#13;
number of people refuse to leave their original homesteads until they have received employment with Coal&#13;
India. In line with the Bank's efforts to ensure that the incomes of project affected persons have been&#13;
restored under projects that have received financial support from the Bank in the past, Coal India has&#13;
agreed tocarry out a review of the resettlement and rehabilitation efforts of the Dudhichua, Jharia and&#13;
Gevra opencast mines and to identify project-affected persons whose incomes are below the poverty line&#13;
established by the Government.&#13;
Project cost&#13;
28.   Table 3.1.8 shows the detailed project cost estimate.&#13;
Alternative project designs&#13;
29.   The option to implement environmental and social mitigating action programs through a separate&#13;
Environmental and Social Mitigation Fund for the coal industry was rejected, since it would have deprived&#13;
Coal India of the incentive to build up its own capacity for dealing with environmental and social issues.&#13;
More specifically with regard to social mitigating actions, alternative designs were considered in the&#13;
context of consultations during the preparation for the Rehabilitation Action Plans and Community&#13;
Development Plans. The design of the Environmental Action Plans was dictated by the need to meet the&#13;
requirements of Indian laws and regulations as well as the Bank Group's Operational Directives in the&#13;
most cost effective way.&#13;

Annex 3.2 PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The subsidiary companies are responsible for the implementation of the Enviormmental Action&#13;
Plans (EAPs), Rehabilitation Action Plans (RAPs) and Indigenous Peoples Development Plans (IPDPs)&#13;
for the selected 25 coal mines. The physical implementation of these plans will be carried out by the&#13;
managers and officers of these mines. Coal India's headquarters will guide the overall implementation of&#13;
this project. Coal India has setup a separate World Bank Projects Division at its headquarters in Calcutta&#13;
with an adequate number of experienced staff. It has strengthened the subsidiary company structure to&#13;
ensure effective implementation of the EAPs, IPDPs, RAPs and the remedial social action programs for&#13;
mines that have received financial support from the Bank in the past.&#13;
Borrower's organization for project implementation&#13;
2.    MINE DESIGN. All of Coal India's projects are planned and designed by Central Mine Planning and&#13;
Design Institute (CMPDI), one of the Coal India's subsidiary companies. It supports subsidiary coal&#13;
companies through regional centers located at the headquarters of these companies. CMPDI employs&#13;
1,300 engineers and other professionals. It is fully equipped to carry out virtually all activities related to&#13;
mine design including geological exploration; planning and design of opencast and underground mines,&#13;
coal beneficiation plants and workshops; monitoring of environmental pollution; and staff training.&#13;
3.    PHYSICAL IMPLEMENTATION. The actual physical implementation is the task of subsidiary compa-&#13;
nies. There are seven such companies engaged in coal production, five of which are involved in this&#13;
project: Northern Coalfields Ltd. (NCL), Central Coalfields Ltd. (CCL), Western Coalfields Ltd. (WCL),&#13;
South Eastern Coalfields Ltd. (SECL), and Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. (MCL). These companies have&#13;
extensive experience in project implementation. At present, these companies manage 118 opencast and&#13;
underground mine projects with a total investment of US$3 billion at various stages of implementation.&#13;
When completed, these projects will have an aggregate production capacity of 126 million tons per year.&#13;
4.    COMPANY ORGANIZATION sTRucTURE. Each subsidiary company is divided into a number of Areas,&#13;
and each Area is managed by an Area General Manager, a senior mining engineer of about 25-30 years of&#13;
experience. Each Area has a number of mines under production and projects under construction. The&#13;
project officer, a mining engineer with 15-20 years of experience, is responsible for the physical imple-&#13;
mentation of a specific project and associated investments. Large projects, with investments exceeding&#13;
US$60 million or with production capacities exceeding three million tons per year, are placed under the&#13;
charge of senior mining engineers of the rank of General Manager, who report directly to the Managing&#13;
Director of the respective subsidiary company. General Managers have more delegated authority in&#13;
financial and administrative matters than managers of smaller projects. Most of the procurement, monitor-&#13;
ing of project implementation and liaisons with the State Governments and local agencies are done by the&#13;
offices above the project level.&#13;
5.    Each project officer is assisted by a pit manager and a number of assistant and undermanagers,&#13;
who are government certified mining engineers. The number of such engineers is statutorily fixed and&#13;
varies according to the size of the mining operation. In addition, each project manager is assisted by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

several other professionals, such as excavation engineers (for opencast mines), electricallmechanical&#13;
engineers, civil engineers, finance managers, personnel managers, etc. Environmental and resettlement and&#13;
rehabilitation related matters are implemented by the Area Manager (Safety and Environment) and Area&#13;
Manager (Resettlement and Rehabilitation) respectively. Mining related environmental issues are dealt&#13;
with by the project manager. See Figure 3.2.1 for organizational arrangements for implementation of&#13;
World Bank Group projects.&#13;
6.    MONITORING ARRANGEMENTS. The Area General Manager and his staff carry out a thorough&#13;
monthly review of all activities with the project manager and other officers in charge of physical imple-&#13;
mentation of a project. Selected projects are reviewed monthly by the Director (Project and Planning) at&#13;
the subsidiary headquarters. Projects facing serious slippage are reviewed by the subsidiary company&#13;
Board of Directors which meets every two months.&#13;
7.    At the Coal India level, all progress reports are reviewed by the Chief General Manager (Project&#13;
Monitoring) who is assisted by a group of experienced professionals and reports to the Director (Techni-&#13;
cal). This group visits the projects and is responsible for timely procurement of all inputs that are dealt&#13;
with at the Coal India level. Projects facing major slippage are reported to the monthly meetings of all&#13;
Chairman-cum-Managing Directors. All problem projects are reviewed by the Board of Directors. Imple-&#13;
mentation reports of projects with investments exceeding US$33 million are sent to the Ministry of Project&#13;
Implementation in Delhi where they are reviewed when implementation problems arise.&#13;
8.    IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES. Despite this elaborate organization for project monitoring Coal India's&#13;
performance in implementing projects has been uneven. There have been both time and cost overruns. The&#13;
Bank has made three loans to Coal India: In 1984, a loan of US$151 million for the development of the&#13;
Dudhichua mine in Singrauli; in 1985 a loan of US$248 million for the development of an opencast mine&#13;
(Block II) and an underground mine (Pooktee-Bulliary) in Jharia coalfield; and in 1987, a loan of US$340&#13;
million for the expansion of an opencast mine (Gevra) in Korba coalfield, the construction of an opencast&#13;
mine (Sonepur-Bazari) and imports of coking coal. In 1992, the Board approved a credit of US$12 million&#13;
for a technical assistance project to deal with mine fires in the Jharia coalfield. The loan for the Jharia&#13;
Coking Coal project was closed on December 31, 1992, the loan for the Dudhichua Coal project on March&#13;
31, 1993 and the loan for Coal Mining and Coal Quality Improvement Project on September 30, 1995.&#13;
9.    Implementation of these projects has been uneven. While the construction of the Dudhichua coal&#13;
mine and the expansion of the Gevra coal mine proceeded without any major problems and ahead of&#13;
schedule, the opencast mine in the Jharia coalfield (Bihar) and Sonepur-Bazari in Ranigunj coalfield (West&#13;
Bengal) were plagued by land acquisition problems. This delayed not only implementation and disburse-&#13;
ments of the loans, it also reduced the commercial viability of these projects. One component, the&#13;
Pooktee-Bulliary underground mine was canceled after it was discovered that the coal reserves at this&#13;
location could not support the original mine design, and the subsidiary coal company was unable to come&#13;
up with another commercially viable proposal.&#13;
10.   Two lessons stand out from the experience with the implementation of these projects:&#13;
Technical assistance greatly enhances the chances that a project is implemented properly and&#13;
on time. The Dudhichua mine is rightly regarded as one of the most successful mines in the&#13;
Singrauli coalfield. This is largely due to the fact that the construction of the mine had,&#13;
during its initial years, considerable assistance and guidance from an international mining&#13;
consultant.&#13;

Project implementation units need to be strengthened, in particular with regard to skills&#13;
required for the implementation of environmental and social action programs.&#13;
11l . SPECIAL MONITORING SETUP FOR WORLD BANK GROUP PROJECTS. Coal India is aware of its shortcom-&#13;
ings in project implementation and has sought technical assistance from the Bank to strengthen its project&#13;
implementation and monitoring capacity. Coal India has already set up a separate organization (World&#13;
Bank Projects Division) to monitor the projects. It is headed by a Chief General Manager, a senior mining&#13;
engineer with over 28 years of experience in project planning and implementation and mine management.&#13;
He is assisted by 14 professionals of various disciplines and a team of local and expatriate consultants.&#13;
The World Bank Projects Division consists of five cells:&#13;
*   Project Monitoring Cell&#13;
*   Procurement Cell&#13;
*   Environmental Cell (which also deals with mine safety)&#13;
*   Resettlement and Rehabilitation Cell (which also deals with IPDPs)&#13;
*   Economic and Financial Evaluation Cell&#13;
The organizational structure of these arrangements is shown in the Figure 3.2.1. The Chief General&#13;
Manager reports the activities of the first four cells to the Director (Technical) of Coal India. For activities&#13;
of the Economic and Financial Evaluation Cell, he reports to the Director (Finance). Coal India has also&#13;
agreed to review the staffing of these cells with the Bank as the implementation of this project progresses.&#13;
12.    PROJECT MONITORING CELL. This cell is responsible for the:&#13;
*   assessment of the technical feasibility of each subproject,&#13;
*   preparation of equipment and civil works specification and procurement schedules, and&#13;
*   monitoring and implementation of subprojects.&#13;
The Bank has already provided technical assistance for better monitoring of subproject implementation&#13;
through the Project Preparation Fund (PPF). (Coal India refers to each of the selected 25 mines as a&#13;
subproject.) Implementation schedules have been prepared for all subprojects. The schedules for inviting&#13;
bids, awarding contracts and completing contracts for procurement activities of all the subprojects and&#13;
statements of the number and average value of procurement contracts have been prepared. The implemen-&#13;
tation schedule also includes resettlement and rehabilitation and social remedial action programs. Coal&#13;
India has installed Microsoft Project in Calcutta and subsidiary company headquarters and at area levels.&#13;
A time-bound detailed implementation plan for each project component, including technical assistance,&#13;
training and a schedule of procurement actions with target dates for each step, has been prepared. Already&#13;
25 stations are operational and engineers and other professionals engaged in monitoring activities have&#13;
been trained. Coal India has established a direct electronic mail link between its World Bank Projects&#13;
Division and Washington.&#13;
13.    Coal India also has a satellite based communications network linking Coal India headquarters with&#13;
subsidiary company headquarters and some area offices for the transmission of data. Additional satellite&#13;
stations are proposed to link all Bank financed projects with Coal India headquarters. This will facilitate&#13;
regular monitoring of the work in progress and greatly assist in the timely decision-making by the man-&#13;
agement, should slippage occur.&#13;
14.    PROCUREMENT CELL. The Procurement Cell is responsible for the procurement of all goods and&#13;
consultancy services under ICB and some selected items by NCB. It prepares the bid documents (in line&#13;
with the Bank Group's guidelines) for all subprojects and monitors procurement activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 143 -&#13;
Annex 3.2&#13;
Page 5 of 24&#13;
15.    ENVIRONMENTAL AND R&amp;R CELLS. These cells assist the subsidiary coal companies in the review of&#13;
all environmental, resettlement and rehabilitation and IPDP issues for all subprojects. They also monitor&#13;
the implementation of EAPs, RAPs and IPDPs.&#13;
16.    ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL EVALUATION CELL. This cell is responsible for the financial and economic&#13;
evaluation of subprojects and for confirning their commercial viability.&#13;
Strengthening of Coal India's capacity to deal with environmental and social issues&#13;
17.    To ensure the timely implementation of this project and the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project,&#13;
Coal India has:&#13;
*   arranged for support from its environmental experts in CMPDI to strengthen the Environ-&#13;
mental Cell;&#13;
*   signed a contract with the Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management,&#13;
which provided a team of social science professionals to support the work and training&#13;
activities for the Resettlement and Rehabilitation Cell; and&#13;
*   hired a team of three expatriate consultants to assist the Procurement Cell.&#13;
18.    Since environmental management is recognized as a separate management function within Coal&#13;
India's corporate structure, appropriate positions have been created at subsidiary headquarters, areas, and&#13;
mines. These positions have been staffed with executives trained in Coal India's Staff College or outside&#13;
the company. While all these executives have backgrounds as mining or civil engineers, the additional&#13;
training on environmental management ensured that they are now qualified to implement environmental&#13;
mitigation programs.&#13;
19.    Resettlement and rehabilitation and community development programs were traditionally dealt&#13;
with by Welfare Officers posted at each mine. With the shift to opencast mining and the resultant need for&#13;
more land and subsequent increase of land 'oustees', the role of these officers has become increasingly&#13;
important. Coal India is currently in the process of setting up an organizational structure for the manage-&#13;
ment of social issues, in particular resettlement and rehabilitation and community development. While the&#13;
positions have been created, the staffing with properly trained personnel has yet to be completed. Coal&#13;
India has agreed to post, by December 31, 1996, full-time social science professionals (CD/R&amp;R officers)&#13;
at each of the 25 mines to assist in the implementation of the IPDPs and RAPs. In mines where resettle-&#13;
ment and rehabilitation officers have not yet been posted, Welfare Officers will deal with the implementa-&#13;
tion of these plans in the interim. Coal India has agreed to provide these officers with training in participa-&#13;
tory community development by June 30, 1996.&#13;
Stakeholders&#13;
20.    Coal India and its subsidiaries are dependent on several entities for mine development and opera-&#13;
tion (approval of the projects, acquisition of land, supply of electricity, recruitment of work force, trans-&#13;
port of goods, dispatch of coal, social welfare for the local community, etc.). Several ministries of the&#13;
Government of India, Indian Railways, the State Governments, State Electricity Boards, various local&#13;
organizations and project-affected people are the stakeholders in this project and are involved in many&#13;
ways from formulation to implementation and operation. The responsibilities of the main stake holders are&#13;
discussed below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 144-&#13;
Annex 3.2&#13;
Page 6 of 24&#13;
21.   GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. Coal India falls under the purview of the Ministry of Coal. The Ministry&#13;
sets the annual and 5-Yearly Plan production targets in consultation with the Planning Commission,&#13;
Railways and the Ministries of Steel and Power. Coal India's annual budget, flow of the Government&#13;
funds to the company and repayment of loans to the Government are also processed by the Ministry. The&#13;
other important subjects dealt with at the Government level are wage and salary structures of workers,&#13;
supervisors and executives; pricing and distribution of coal; and appointment of all full time and part time&#13;
directors in Coal India and its subsidiary companies and the chief executives of all companies. The&#13;
Ministry is also responsible for acquisition of all virgin coal bearing land and for assigning coal mining&#13;
blocks to the private sector. The Ministry of Labor is responsible for labor employment laws and exit&#13;
policy processes. It finances the National Renewal Fund and oversees mine safety and worker's welfare.&#13;
The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) is responsible for the environmental pollution control&#13;
policy. It enacts rules and regulations and oversees their implementation, approves Environment Manage-&#13;
ment Plans, releases forest land and oversees implementation through the Central Pollution Control Board&#13;
(CPCB). Indian Railways plays an important role since it transports about 70% of Coal India's coal&#13;
output.&#13;
22.   STATE GOVERNMENTS. In the State sector, companies are dependent on district officials for mining&#13;
leases; acquisition of land for mining; related jobs not covered by the Central Government; resettlement&#13;
and rehabilitation of project-affected people; development of social infrastructure, roads, and communica-&#13;
tions; and maintenance of law and order. The State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) supervise imple-&#13;
mentation of approved EMPs. The local State Electricity Boards (SEBs) ensure adequate power supply&#13;
and are also the major coal consumers.&#13;
23.   LOCAL COMMUNITIES. People that live in communities surrounding coal mines have a particular&#13;
stake in these operations. They affect their lives in many ways. For many of them the opening of a coal&#13;
mine led to a drastic change in traditional lifestyles. Some were able to find jobs with the coal company;&#13;
others had to look for employment with contractors or decided to move away. Quite a few had to give up&#13;
their accustomed homesteads and move to a resettlement site. In the context of this project Coal India has&#13;
implemented a number of steps that should make the adjustments to new lifestyles easier. Coal India&#13;
provided the people affected by the 25 mine projects, their representatives and local NGOs with informa-&#13;
tion about the EAPs, RAPs and IPDPs and consulted extensively with them about these plans and their&#13;
implementation (Annex 2.6).&#13;
Role of the Bank during project implementation&#13;
24.   The Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project is a complex project with 25 mining subprojects, some of&#13;
which are as big as normal Bank projects in terms of investment requirements. The subprojects are spread&#13;
over 11 coalfields in five States in the east central part of India. It takes more than two days rail journey&#13;
from Calcutta to reach some of the mine sites, so it will not be possible for the Bank mission to visit every&#13;
project even once a year. The role of the Bank will mainly be to monitor the implementation of policy&#13;
support that Coal India is to receive from the Government and the implementation of technical assistance&#13;
for institution building and to supervise selected subprojects. Local consultants will assist in the supervi-&#13;
sion of the subprojects.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 3.2&#13;

Implementation arrangements&#13;
Environment Action Plans(EAPs)&#13;
25.    The immediate objective of the EAPs is to improve environmental conditions in the selected&#13;
mines in order to maintain environmental performance in full compliance with Indian rules and regulations&#13;
and the Bank Group's Operational Directive 4.01. The targeted environmental parameters are: water&#13;
quality and hydrology, air and noise quality and land reclamation. The main objectives of this project are&#13;
to enhance Coal India's capacity to manage environmental issues effectively and extend environmental&#13;
compliance to their other mines and to enhance Coal India's capacity to respond to regional environmental&#13;
issues that stretch beyond the boundaries of its mines. Some of the activities at the mine level are preceded&#13;
by studies at Coal India level and the subsidiary company level to quantify the extent of the mitigating&#13;
activity required at each mine.&#13;
26.   In all the subprojects, the mitigation measures are similar in nature and differ only in magnitude.&#13;
The EAP at mine level can be, therefore, described in a generic mode, and need not be repeated for each&#13;
mine.&#13;
27.   WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT. Surface and underground water at and around the mine site may be&#13;
contaminated from the uncontrolled release of water from the mining area, coal processing plants and&#13;
workshops. Runoff water from overburden dumps and coal piles, if not collected and controlled, may also&#13;
contribute to contamination. Discharge of effluent from inadequate sewage treatment plants or scattered&#13;
soak pits in colonies is a potential source of contamination to drinking water wells and other sources.&#13;
Cutting through the water table during mining operations and removal or dumping of overburden may&#13;
affect the water shed and change the hydrology of the mine area. This may cause a reduction in the water&#13;
flow, deplete drinking water wells, change the water table and damage the aquifer. The following mitigat-&#13;
ing actions would be taken:&#13;
a)  All surface water collections and effluent management systems will be reviewed and no&#13;
uncontrolled, untreated water will be released after June 1997.&#13;
b)  Specific mitigation plans will be developed for each mine. Storm water, mine water and&#13;
other effluents from the industrial area will be collected and treated (if required) to meet&#13;
discharge standards. Recycling and reuse will be maximized before discharge takes place.&#13;
Effluents will be discharged only if they meet CPCB standards.&#13;
c)  Monitoring of groundwater levels and quality in nearby village wells will be required only&#13;
within the hydrogeological impact area of the mine Technically acceptable environmental&#13;
monitoring programs should be in place by January 1997.&#13;
d)  Water quality sampling kits will be provided at each mine site to test the parameters needing&#13;
instant testing (e.g. pH, conductivity, turbidity, etc). Sufficient lab facilities will be devel-&#13;
oped to test all parameters required in the Consent Letter and the water quality analysis&#13;
schedule of Indian industrial discharge standards. Water quality sampling and analyses will&#13;
be performed once each quarter, or more frequently if required by regulatory bodies. All&#13;
analyses will be performed according to standards and methods approved by the SPCB and/&#13;
or CPCB.&#13;
e)  Water in wells will be analyzed to determine the impact of sewage soak pits on groundwater.&#13;
To understand the impact on groundwater due to the sewage system of a township, the&#13;
quality of ground water at a point between the sewage system and the nearest drinking water&#13;
wells will be monitored.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 146 -&#13;
Annex 3.2&#13;
Page 8 of 24&#13;
f)   For new soakpits, studies will be undertaken by a sanitary engineering consultant to deter-&#13;
mine soil suitability for septic leachfield disposal. The study will include a review of&#13;
leachfield design to determine the adequacy of the leachfield area, percolation rate, soil strata&#13;
and proximity to groundwater resources.&#13;
g)  Based on the above surveys, CMPDI will identify unsuitable soil characteristics in the&#13;
colonies and design sanitary wastewater treatment systems and secondary treatments for&#13;
disinfecting the effluent. A facility should be provided with a discharge flow measurement&#13;
device. Contractors will perform start up and stabilization operations and demonstrate that&#13;
the treatment systems comply with Indian standards for discharge of sanitary effluent.&#13;
h)  SURFACE WATER CONTROL AND TREATMENT SCHEMES. The design of mine effluent treatment&#13;
systems will ensure compliance with Indian industrial discharge standards. The design&#13;
process should begin with an assessment of the quantity of water to be discharged from each&#13;
mine. Designs will maximize recycling of collected surface water. The following elements&#13;
will be included in the treatment system designs:&#13;
*   Collection drains will be provided where fixed dust suppression sprays are employed&#13;
(i.e. coal loading points, coal handling plants, wash plants and along paved haul roads).&#13;
Drains will be properly sloped to avoid ponded water and will be lined with vegetation,&#13;
gravel, or cement according to erosion potential and slope.&#13;
*   Settling ponds and polishing ponds will be designed with adequate size flow through&#13;
characteristics and retention time for settling of fine and compliance with Indian&#13;
standards for industrial discharge. Discharge channels will be equipped with flow&#13;
measurement devices.&#13;
*   Maintenance shop oily water treatment facilities will include collection, physical&#13;
separation (API separator), and secondary treatment (physical/chemical or biological)&#13;
facilities. These will be supplied with discharge flow measurement devices.&#13;
i)   HYDROLOGY. Nearby villages wells will be used to monitor groundwater levels, flow and&#13;
water quality to determine impact of mine operations. The top of each well will be profes-&#13;
sionally surveyed to accurately plot the location of the well and the aquifer level, from a&#13;
national datum, on a topographic map. The water samples will be collected as per standard&#13;
procedures for sampling and analysis of drinking water. Such samplings and analyses shall&#13;
be performed once each quarter. Should wells be adversely affected due to mining opera-&#13;
tions, Coal India will arrange the regular supply of adequate quantity and quality of water to&#13;
the villages.&#13;
28.    FUGITIVE DUST MONITORING AND CONTROL. Opencast mine activities may increase the level of&#13;
suspended particulate matter, which includes respirable particulate matter (smaller than 10 microns). The&#13;
dust is generated from the crushing, handling and transport of coal and from drilling and blasting opera-&#13;
tions. The health effect of suspended particulate matter, mainly 10 microns and smaller, are bronchial&#13;
problems, lung diseases and nuisance. The following activities will be taken to monitor and improve air&#13;
quality:&#13;
a)  Existing air monitoring data will be analzed and a dust control plan will be developed.&#13;
*   Analyses of existing air monitoring data will be undertaken for all colonies to identify&#13;
problem areas and for the preparation of remedial management plans. Analyses are to&#13;
be carried out by CMPDI, which is familiar with mine fugitive dust mitigation tech-&#13;
niques. CMPDI will prepare a dust mitigation plan to cover all villages currently&#13;
situated within core zones and on the fringes of buffer zones. The plans will encompass&#13;
areas inside and outside of the active mine, as appropriate.&#13;

A technical analysis of the existing dust suppression program will be undertaken at&#13;
each mine, in conjunction with the above study of monitoring data. As a result of this&#13;
technical review a dust control plan for each mine will be developed, using one of the&#13;
techniques selected from those detailed below under 'dust suppression on haul roads.'&#13;
b)  Ambient air contamination monitoring will be undertaken in all villages currently situated&#13;
within core zones and on the fringe of buffer zones to determine compliance with environ-&#13;
mental standards. The mines will have high volume samplers, analysis equipment and&#13;
vehicles for collection of ambient air samples.&#13;
c)  Dust suppression on haul roads will be improved.&#13;
Existing watering equipment on haul road will be retrofitted as required, to include&#13;
pressure water spray nozzles for more efficient use of water and improved dust sup-&#13;
pression. Water tankers will be outfitted in sufficient numbers to keep haul roads wet&#13;
during the operation hours and more watering stations will be provided for spray trucks&#13;
to reduce transit time and maximize equipment effectiveness. Wherever cost effective&#13;
fixed sprayers will be installed along haul roads. Haul roads that will be used heavily&#13;
over long periods will be paved.&#13;
Other dust suppression techniques will include regular cleaning of haul roads of&#13;
spillage, prevention of overfilling of trucks and use of dust extractors for blast hole&#13;
drills.&#13;
d)  Designs of spray systems will include pumps, pipelines nozzles and runoff water collection&#13;
systems, and also cover coal stockyard and truck and railway loading points. Runoff water&#13;
will be collected and treated in mine runoff settling basin systems or provisions will be made&#13;
for settling basin treatment prior to recycling.&#13;
29.    LAND RECLAMATION. Mining operations impact the land and soil in many ways. Excavation of&#13;
rocks and coal damage land and vegetation and cause voids. This can be best mitigated by backfilling the&#13;
voids, provided no lower seams are to be mined later. Overburden dumps and rejects piles degrade land&#13;
aesthetics and the resultant fugitive dust and run-off water cause air and water pollution. Agricultural,&#13;
residential, industrial or forest lands are sometimes lost to opencast mines. Spontaneous combustion of&#13;
coal or reject piles lead to surface fires which cause air pollution and land sterilization. Top soil is lost to&#13;
overburden dumps and coal stockpiles. The erosion of overburden dumps due to rain and wind lead to loss&#13;
of soil and siltation of water drainage system. Loss of forest land hinders animal migration and reduces&#13;
vegetation cover. The following mitigation measures are included in this project:&#13;
a)  An engineering study will be carried out to determine the physical safety and slope stability&#13;
of overburden dumps and recommend remedial actions (study in progress).&#13;
b)  A panel of experts will review the above report and recommend the measures for implemen-&#13;
tation.&#13;
c)  A study will be undertaken to identify the most suitable strata for use as substrate for fertil-&#13;
izer application and to develop and progressively improve the technical and biological&#13;
reclamation of the spoil dumps. The study should continue throughout the project duration.&#13;
d)  The work of revegetation of reclaimed areas, overburden dumps and afforestation of waste&#13;
land will continue with the State forest departments who have the requisite experience. The&#13;
reclaimed areas should be permanently fenced to prevent grazing by livestock.&#13;
e)  The companies will establish nurseries to develop suitable saplings and research soil im-&#13;
provement needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 3.2&#13;
Page 10 of 24&#13;
f)   The companies will have five-year establishment programs to monitor and manage the soil&#13;
and vegetation, replace failed vegetation, repair erosion damage, monitor continued soil&#13;
fertility and repeat fertilizer application, and control damage to vegetation due to grazing.&#13;
Strengthening of environmental management at the corporate level&#13;
30.    Coal India will undertake the following activities:&#13;
a)  In each of the subprojects, Coal India will develop monitoring programs for air, water and&#13;
hydrology and will supply mobile instruments and field testing kits to determine the scope of&#13;
the routine monitoring program at each mine.&#13;
b)  Coal India will establish seven laboratories in specified locations fully equipped with instru-&#13;
ments, furniture, computers and vehicles to carry out environment sample analysis&#13;
c)  Coal India will conduct a study concerning safe disposal of oil, grease and water effluent&#13;
from workshops in full compliance with government regulations. The oil content in water&#13;
should not exceed 10 mg/liter unless recycled in coal processing facilities.&#13;
d)  At present, vibration monitoring is required every six months, when changes in explosive&#13;
type or charge are introduced or when the distance from residential areas is less than 300&#13;
meters. Monitoring frequency will be enchanced after studying local conditions.&#13;
e)  A minimum acceptable coal quality, based on the geo-mining conditions and operational&#13;
practices, will be set for each mine. Quality control procedures will be developed as appro-&#13;
priate. Alternative techniques for upgrading coal quality of the run mine coal should be&#13;
explored if adequate compensation for improved coal quality can be assured.&#13;
f)   Coal India will assist pit head power plants in a study of the feasibility of ash disposal in the&#13;
mined out areas.&#13;
g)  In areas of concentrated industrial development activities, Coal India will participate in&#13;
regional planning to develop a regional approach to environmental monitoring, management&#13;
and land use planning.&#13;
h)  As part of the technical assistance program, a team of international experts will study&#13;
environment management capability from the corporate to the mine level to find ways and&#13;
means to strengthen it in order to better implement the EAPs.&#13;
Resettle,nent, rehabilitation and community development&#13;
31.   Implementation of the new resettlement and rehabilitation and community development policies&#13;
will be a difficult process that will require substantial attention and support. These represent new direc-&#13;
tions, to both project-affected people and mine managers. The policy on resettlement and rehabilitation&#13;
limits the rehabilitation assistance for land owners from life-long employment in the coal company to&#13;
assistance during a limited period. During this period the project-affected people have to contribute to their&#13;
own successful rehabilitation. The policy on community development will make assistance to surrounding&#13;
communities a participatory and transparent process, thus limiting the discretionary powers of the mine&#13;
managers and making them more accountable to the surrounding communities.&#13;
32.    The resettlement and rehabilitation policy and the community development policy are corporate&#13;
policies, and are meant to be implemented throughout Coal India. The following section describes Coal&#13;
India's organizational arrangements for the implementation of these policies under this project. These&#13;
should be considered examples of the arrangements that must be in place, and the issues that must be dealt&#13;
with in all the mines of Coal India. The present project is a leaming ground, and as such a pilot and&#13;
demonstration project in an area that is relatively an unchartered territory for Coal India.&#13;

Institutional arrangements&#13;
33.   In order to ensure effective implementation of Coal India's resettlement and rehabilitation policy,&#13;
Coal India has agreed to strengthen the implementing organisational structure. It is envisaged that institu-&#13;
tional strengthening takes place at the Coal India level and at the mine level. Coal India has agreed to&#13;
provide the General Manager (Resettlement and Rehabilitation) at its World Bank Projects Division with&#13;
sufficient resources and manpower to guide, support and monitor the implementation of the new Coal&#13;
India policy. In addition, Coal India has hired one consultant, with a social science background and&#13;
'hands-on' field experience in community development and income generation, for the whole project&#13;
period. Additional use of external consultants may be required for specific tasks, such as periodic evalua-&#13;
tion surveys, case studies to identify self-employment opportunities and diagnostic studies to identify&#13;
problems of integration at resettlement sites.&#13;
34.    The major responsibility for implementation of the Resettlement Action Plans lies with the&#13;
subsidiary and mine level management. Dedicated resettlement and rehabilitation staff are present in&#13;
several subprojects and/or at area levels. Coal India has agreed to ensure that they will receive necessary&#13;
and relevant training in area where this is needed.&#13;
35.    Coal India has agreed to a hire social scientist at each of the 25 selected mines to be responsible&#13;
fulltime for resettlement and rehabilitation activities and community development activities. In addition,&#13;
Coal India will post 6 General Managers (R&amp;R): one at the corporate level and one at each of the five&#13;
subsidiary companies involved in the proposed project.&#13;
36.    The staff and officers of Coal India and it's subsidiaries will be trained and in place by September&#13;
1, 1996. Coal India has agreed that the key resettlement and rehabilitation staff will, as a general rule, not&#13;
be transferred within the first three years of project implementation.&#13;
37.    NGOs and specialized local organizations will be engaged to assist in specific tasks, such as&#13;
training for self-employment and community development work. The selection of the NGOs is crucial and&#13;
has to be done with great care. The NGO must have a proven record of dedicated community development&#13;
and income generating activities. The Resettlement and Rehabilitation Cell of Coal India must be involved&#13;
in the selection procedure and must approve the selected NGO. The Non-Governmental Organization&#13;
(NGO) or consultants, who will assist Coal India in the implementation of the RAPs and the IPDPs, must&#13;
have the following qualifications:&#13;
*   Be a registered society (or company) under the Registration of Societies Act or any such acts&#13;
that are relevant to the state in which the mine is located. It should fulfill the mandatory&#13;
regulations of such acts, including the annual audit of the statement of accounts.&#13;
*   Have appropriate professional and language skills and experience in tribal, community and&#13;
rural development and also for training in community organization, leadership and skills&#13;
improvement.&#13;
*   Have an understanding of gender and poverty aspects in the communities in the area, and&#13;
have the ability to address the needs of women and other vunerable groups, and ensure their&#13;
full participation so that the benefits reach them.&#13;
*   Have adequate administration and staff structure (including women field workers) to under-&#13;
take the field tasks.&#13;
*   Priority will be given to local NGOs, and NGO with staff from the area of operation. If such&#13;
NGOs are not available, professional social workers from that state, with the above qualifica-&#13;
tions will be engaged to carry out the plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 150-&#13;
Annex 3.2&#13;
Page 12 of 24&#13;
38.   During the preparation of the Rehabilitation Action Plans, the affected people were consulted in&#13;
various ways:&#13;
*   Since every household was visited by the interviewers, this created an opportunity for&#13;
consultation. The survey contained questions regarding affected people's perceptions of&#13;
issues related to land acquisition, compensation, benefits of the project displacing them, and&#13;
the relocation site and the host community.&#13;
*   All consultants had more unstructured interaction with the project-affected people than the&#13;
officials of Coal India. Most of the consultants organised focus group sessions for various&#13;
groups in the villages, such as women, landless and tribals. This information was used to&#13;
formulate a strategy for involvement of the project-affected people in the Rehabilitation&#13;
Action Plan, and for their active participation in the resettlement and rehabilitation process.&#13;
39.   As a further step in informing the project-affected people of their entitlements, both the policy of&#13;
Coal India and the Rehabilitation Action Plans are in the process of being translated into relevant local&#13;
languages. Generally Coal India has issued press statements to newspapers in the affected areas and in the&#13;
major cities for the wider dissemination of the policy change.&#13;
40.   COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. Coal India has some experience in community development. The major&#13;
challenge in implementing the IPDPs is an organizational one. The ultimate responsibility of implement-&#13;
ing community development schemes lies with the communities themselves. Coal India, the State Govern-&#13;
ment, and NGOs can only support and facilitate this development. Providing basic physical facilities to the&#13;
communities, without their active contribution and involvement in the planning, implementation and&#13;
operation, has led to under utilization of the facilities, breakdown of services and a feeling of apathy and&#13;
dependency.&#13;
41.   These community development plans are demand-based and community-initiated. In the interest&#13;
of project sustainability and to achieve the social objectives of the project, all efforts will be made to invite&#13;
participation of local communities and local NGOs/Community Based Organization (CBOs) in order to&#13;
increase the utilization of local know-how and materials, and to employ local labor.&#13;
42.   To the extent possible, all community development contracts will be reserved for the local com-&#13;
munities. If local communities are not able to organize themselves to participate in the bidding procedure,&#13;
Coal India will invite and finance eligible local NGOs/CBOs to help the community to do so. NGOs/&#13;
CBOs could also manage the contracts with the consent of an elected village council, or train the eligible&#13;
people in the village to share some of the activities. Coal India has agreed to introduce necessary flexibil-&#13;
ity in its contract award procedures to accommodate the communities' desire to participate either directly&#13;
or through NGO intermediaries.&#13;
43.    Since the community will have inadequate capacity to receive and manage funds, it may be&#13;
necessary to employ a suitable intermediary or agent to conduct procurement and account for the funds on&#13;
behalf of the community. Such an agent could be a NGO, private entity or others who will act through&#13;
intense participation of the community.&#13;
44.    Coal India alone will not have the capacity to organize and facilitate the mobilization of focus&#13;
groups and working groups. NGOs/CBOs experienced with tribal communities and with proven track&#13;
records in community development are needed to assist in facilitating the process. The NGOs should&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 151 -&#13;
Annex 3.2&#13;
Page 13 of 24&#13;
preferably have female field workers. Involvement and mobilization of local CBOs will be encouraged.&#13;
Thus, NGOs will have a key role to play as an intermediary between the coal mine management and the&#13;
community.&#13;
45.   The main role of Coal India is to provide financial support to establish community infrastructure&#13;
and relevant community activities, and to provide for temporary outside assistance from NGOs/consultants&#13;
and others. In principle, the operation, utilization and maintenance of created community infrastructure&#13;
lies with the communities, although Coal India may assist with initial operational cost in a transitional&#13;
period of no more than two years. The State Government should be pursued to deliver public services, and&#13;
extend development activities, according to State rules and regulations.&#13;
46.   The implementation of the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan will follow a participatory&#13;
approach, and will involve the following steps at the village level:&#13;
a)  Participatory Rural Appraisal and framework planning at village level for identification of&#13;
felt needs and required actions. The TOR for this exercise is attached. This initial activity&#13;
will be undertaken by Consultants.&#13;
b)  Formation (or boosting/reviving) of voluntary working groups, particularly among women&#13;
and youth, to initiate, support and monitor local activities and improvements. To facilitate&#13;
this organization, the assistance of local NGOs/CBOs will be sought and partly financed by&#13;
the project&#13;
c)  Preparation and Submission of proposals by the working groups to the Community Develop-&#13;
ment Council. They will have to include:&#13;
i)  Scope and justification of the project&#13;
ii) Contribution and commitment of community/group for participation in implementation&#13;
and responsibilities for operation and maintenance&#13;
iii) specification of who will carry out the project, and&#13;
iv) Assistance sought from the Community Development Council, to be financed by Coal&#13;
India&#13;
d)  Implementation of selected project activities with participation of working group and peri-&#13;
odic review/planning meetings.&#13;
47.    Overall the activities of the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan can be classified into nine&#13;
steps/phases, some of which will overlap, and some of which will be repeated during the project period:&#13;
*   PREPARATION AND MOBILIZATION (3 months), involving the posting of full time CD&amp;R&amp;R&#13;
Officers in each mine under the project, and the identification of suitable NGOs in the&#13;
vicinity of the mines.&#13;
*   BUILDING IMPLEMENTATION CAPACITY (3 months, repeated at intervals), involving training and&#13;
orientation of Coal India staff, NGOs, and the establishment of Community Development&#13;
Councils in the mine-areas.&#13;
*   INFORMATION AND CONSULTATION (3-6 months, repeated at intervals), involving meetings and&#13;
publications to inform and consult government officials (DC/BDO), local elected leaders and&#13;
communities about the scope and possibilities of the plan, and elicit feed back for improved&#13;
implementation, and ensuring that government is fully informed and involved.&#13;
*   BASELINE SURVEY AND PARTICIPATORY RURAL APPRAISAL (3-6 months), involving identification&#13;
(reassessment) of community needs and possible projects, leadership and community work-&#13;
ers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 152 -&#13;
Annex 3.2&#13;
Page 14 of 24&#13;
*   VILLAGE LEVEL PLANNING (3 months, repeated annually), involving establishment of village&#13;
working groups, the preparation of draft annual community plans, and village consultative&#13;
meetings and consequent adjustments of final draft.&#13;
*   ANNUAL INDIGENOUS PEOPLES DEVELOPMENT PLAN (3 months, repeated annually), involving the&#13;
consolidation of mine-specific plans, submitting to Coal India, approval by Coal India, and&#13;
disbursement of funds for implementation.&#13;
*   VILLAGE LEVEL IMPLEMENTATION (ongoing for the project period), of community assets for&#13;
one fiscal year at a time, according to plan and budget. The majority of the community assets&#13;
will be implemented during the first three years of the project. Some community activities&#13;
will be implemented over one fiscal year, others will be ongoing throughout the entire five&#13;
year period.&#13;
*   MONITORING AND FOLLOW UP (quarterly), involving ongoing feed back from village working&#13;
groups to NGOs, quarterly reporting from NGO to CD&amp;R&amp;R Officer and R&amp;R Cell, on&#13;
which the Community Development Council will report quarterly and formally to the&#13;
subsidiary and R&amp;R Cell. The CD&amp;R&amp;R Officer will submit a separate report to R&amp;R Cell,&#13;
who will consolidate these into a comprehensive half-yearly report, including accounts. An&#13;
independent evaluation will be carried out after two years and four years of implementation,&#13;
and an ex-post evaluation will be carried out two years after project completion.&#13;
*   TURN OVER TO COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT (after year 2-3, then ongoing), involving the hand&#13;
over of physical assets for maintenance and management. Although government responsibili-&#13;
ties for staffing and maintenance of major assets will be vigorously pursued, community&#13;
involvement will also be promoted. Similarly, assistance to community activities will be&#13;
phased out once the technical and management expertise has developed in the community.&#13;
At the outset (planning stage) of each activity, the NGO and the community will agree on a&#13;
tentative time for hand over of assets and activities to community management.&#13;
48.    The implementation arrangement has been kept simple, as indicated in Table 3.2.1, where the&#13;
different responsibilities are described at the major levels.&#13;
Implementation issues&#13;
49.    The major challange for the implementation of the new policy is to make the self-employment&#13;
option an attractive and viable alternative to a job with the subsidiary. There is no global solution to this.&#13;
One lesson that has been learned is that training in itself is not enough, even when it is followed by loans&#13;
or grants. The majority of project-affected people are farmers or agricultural laborers, and the transition&#13;
into another profession probably requires a great deal of follow-up involving business planning assistance&#13;
and extension services.&#13;

50.    One of the first activities to be taken up in the subprojects is determining the persons who are&#13;
eligible for rehabilitation assistance, popularly know as 'the closing of the list.' The censuses carried out&#13;
by the consultants and NGOs for preparation of the Rehabilitation Action Plans are fairly accurate, and&#13;
will forn the basis on which the list of entitled persons is to be determined. In order to ensure that nobody&#13;
takes undo advantage of the situtation, and that every entitled person is informed of his or her entitlements,&#13;
information campaigns will be carried out on a house-to-house basis by the Resettlement and Rehabilita-&#13;
tion Officer of the subsidiary with the assistance of NGOs. This will include the distribution and reading&#13;
of a brochure explaining who is entitled to what assistance. A simple identity card (with a photo of the&#13;
entitled person) will be issued by the subsidiary. The details of this procedure have been developed. This&#13;
procedure is adopted in order to ensure that people are aware of the scope and limitations of the entitle-&#13;
ments. From the operational plans for resettlement and rehabilitation it is clear that the impact of land&#13;
acquisition for the majority of the project-affected people will take place in 1996-97.&#13;
51.    Technical guidelines for the implementation of the policy will be produced by the Rehabilitation&#13;
and Resettlement Cell of Coal India based on the initial experience in the subprojects. They will contain&#13;
operational details, such as rationale and procedures for verification of the identities of project-affected&#13;
people, how to conduct information campaigns, how to carry out the alternative rehabilitation entitlements,&#13;
and the time limitations of the entitlements.&#13;
52.    Technical assistance, mainly by local consultants and intense supervision by the Resettlement and&#13;
Rehabilitation Cell of Coal India, is of prime importance to the successful implementation of the resettle-&#13;
ment and rehabilitation policy.&#13;
53.    Coal India has agreed to ensure that each mine has a full-time Community Development/ Resettle-&#13;
ment and Rehabilitation Officer (CD/R&amp;R Officer) who will oversee the implementation of Rehabilitation&#13;
Action Plans and Indigenous Peoples Development Plans. Since it may not be possible for Coal India to&#13;
recruit an adequate number of qualified social scientists for these positions, Coal India has agreed to&#13;
properly train and deploy its Welfare Officers for this purpose. This would have two advantages: it would&#13;
help ensure that at least some of the welfare measures Coal India's employees enjoy might be extended to&#13;
the local population (where feasible) and it would permit Coal India to maintain the time schedule for&#13;
implementation of Rehabilitation Action Plans and Indigenous Peoples Development Plans.&#13;
54.    One of the prime activities being undertaken in the subprojects is the identification of the persons&#13;
eligible for rehabilitation assistance, popularly known as 'the closing of the list'. The census carried out by&#13;
the consultants/NGOs for preparation of the Resettlement Action Plans are fairly accurate, and should&#13;
form the basis to prepare the list of entitled persons. In order to ensure that nobody takes undue advantage&#13;
of the situation, and that every entitled person gets informed of his/her entitlements, information cam-&#13;
paigns will be carried out on a house to house basis by the CD/R&amp;R Officer of the subsidiary, with the&#13;
assistance of NGOs. This will include the distribution and reading of a brochure explaining the entitle-&#13;
ments. A simple photo-identity card will be issued to each entitled person by the subsidiary. The details of&#13;
this procedure have been developed, and tested in one of the subsidiary coal companies. This procedure&#13;
will be adopted to ensure that people are aware of the scope and limitations of their entitlements.&#13;
55.    The community focus and the emphasis on alternative rehabilitation options to jobs in the mines&#13;
are complex and difficult tasks. In order to ensure that experiences gained are subsequently utilized,&#13;
implementation of the new policy will be done under close supervision and guidance of the Resettlement&#13;
and Rehabilitation Cell of Coal India and the social science consultants. This is currently being imple-&#13;
mented. The General Manager (R&amp;R) and the consultants visited all areas under the project where resettle-&#13;
ment is ongoing.&#13;

56.    Technical assistance, mainly by local consultants, and intense supervision by the Resettlement and&#13;
Rehabilitation Cell of Coal India is very important to the successful implementation of the resettlement&#13;
and rehabilitation and community development policies.&#13;
57.    Unlike the implementation of the RAPs which will be the sole responsibility of Coal India's&#13;
subsidiaries, the implementation of the IPDPs will be shared with the communities that will ultimately&#13;
benefit from these plans. The purpose of this arrangement is to ensure that the projects that will be fi-&#13;
nanced under these plans have the full support of the communities.&#13;
Procurement organization&#13;
58.    Coal India's annual budget for the procurement of goods, civil works and services exceeds US$ 1.5&#13;
billion. There is a large procurement organization at the corporate headquarters in Calcutta, at the subsid-&#13;
iary headquarters and at lower levels (with clearly defined delegated authority). Coal India also has past&#13;
experience in procurement of Bank Group financed goods. The World Bank Projects Division in Calcutta&#13;
will be responsible for procuring all goods under ICB and the equipment required for environmental&#13;
monitoring and laboratory analysis under NCB procedures. Subsidiary headquarters will procure all other&#13;
goods and the areas/subprojects will handle the civil works contracts. Schedules which include invitation&#13;
for bids, award of contract and start and completion of work have been prepared for all major procurement&#13;
actions. Standard bid documents, in line with Bank Group procurement guidelines and standards, have&#13;
been prepared for all types of procurement and will be followed at all levels. Since the procurement&#13;
activities are spread over a number of points, Coal India will submit a quarterly report about the status of&#13;
procurement and statement of expenditures.. All levels involved in procurement actions will maintain&#13;
separate accounts of expenditure for EAPs, RAPs and IPDPs which will be audited separately by an&#13;
auditor approved by the Bank Group. Procurement details are shown in Table 3.2.2.&#13;
Schedule of disbursements&#13;
59.    The phasing of disbursement, detailing proposed IDA financing and the borrower's counterpart&#13;
funding, is shown in the Table 3.2.3. The disbursement schedule is based on the assumption that the credit&#13;
will be effective during the fourth quarter of FY 1996, and that it will be fully disbursed by the final&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

quarter of FY200 1. The schedule indicates that during the early period, as the bids are invited and con-&#13;
tracts signed, disbursement remain low. But during the second, third and fourth year disbursements peak.&#13;
Specific actions required&#13;
60.      In recognition of its past inadequacy, Coal India has agreed to strengthen its organization and&#13;
infrastructure to implement its environment and social development policies. It accepts that technical&#13;
assistance could greatly enhance the chances of the project being implemented properly and in time.&#13;
Project implementation units need to be strengthened, in particular with the level of expertise in the&#13;
implementation of environmental and social action programs. Coal India is ready to identify the weak&#13;
areas and to take time bound remedial actions. Coal India recognizes its responsibility in regional environ-&#13;
mental monitoring and in land use planing. It is aware that it needs cooperation of NGOs or other commu-&#13;
nity based organization to facilitate community participation in the implementation of its resettlement and&#13;
rehabilitation and community development policies. Table 3.2.4 shows the actions being taken by Coal&#13;
India to achieve some of the important development objectives.&#13;

Developmental issues                                            Specific actions to be taken&#13;
I.  Coal India's capability to implement EAPs, RAPs and IPDPs.   A panel of intemational and domestic experts will review the organization&#13;
and submit recommendations for itnplementation by Decembcr 1997.&#13;
2.   Shortage of trained staff.                                Pending the above study, recruitment and training of additional staff are in&#13;
progress and will be completed by December 1996. Consultants for&#13;
strengthening procuremcnt ccll and social development ccll are in placc.&#13;
3.  Weak project monitoring capability.                        Implementation schedules have been prepared in Microsoft Project.&#13;
Schedule for inviting bids, awarding contracts, and completion of&#13;
contracts for all procurement activities have been prepared. Implementa-&#13;
tion schedules also include R&amp;R and social remedial action program..&#13;
Microsoft Project has been installed in Calcutta and subsidiary company&#13;
headquarters and Area offices, and professional stafftrained.&#13;
4.   Procurement delay.                                        All bid documents above an agreed threshold, required during the first&#13;
year operation have been prepared. Standard bid documents have been&#13;
prepared (as per Bank guidelines) for many jobs which are repetitive in&#13;
nature.&#13;
5.   Lack of procedures to implement EAPs, and intemal         Coal India has agreed to set up procedures (with assistance from outside&#13;
organization to implement RAPs and IPDPs.                 experts) to monitor all elements of environmental pollution, set up labs to&#13;
analyze the samples, to take remedial steps as required by law, augment&#13;
the personnel strength and seek assistance from NGOs/other organizations&#13;
for the implementation of RAPs and IPDPs by December 1996.&#13;
6.   Safety of OB dumps and outside disposal system.           An engineering study is in progress to identify the safety issues and&#13;
recommend remedial steps to be taken in the study report will be available&#13;
by August 1996. A panel of intemational and domestic experts will&#13;
review the findings and recommended measures for implementation&#13;
7.  Improvement of coal quality.                               Coal India has agreed to declare its run-of-mine coal quality parameters&#13;
and enter into supply contracts with major consumers and to introduce&#13;
bonus/penalty clauses to ensure quality. It has also agreed to beneficiate&#13;

Supervision plan&#13;
61.   The project will require intensive multi-disciplinary monitoring and supervision. Besides the&#13;
special monitoring set up described at paragraphs I 1-16 in this annex, extensive reviews would be be&#13;
carried out by two panels of experts.&#13;
Panel of expertsfor overburden dunmp safety&#13;
62.   One of the main concems of the Association relates to the stability and safety of about 150 over-&#13;
burden dumps in the 25 mines. The slopes of the dumps exceed the safe angle recommended by MoEF.&#13;
Though some of the dumps have been standing unchanged for 10-15 years, experts assisting in the ap-&#13;
praisal of this project recommended that every dump should be studied for its continued safety. Coal India&#13;
has engaged the Indian School of Mines, a leading geo-science institution in the country, to carry out a&#13;
safety engineering study of all dumps in the project. Their report is expected to be submitted to Coal India&#13;
by the end of June 1996. The Association has further asked that their report should be reviewed by an&#13;
expert panel consisting of one foreign and one local expert and the panel's recommendations should be&#13;
implemented by Coal India, after review by the Association.&#13;
63.   To establish the panel, Coal India will invite proposals for experts from a list of reputed consult-&#13;
ants/universities in India and abroad acceptable to the Association. The selection will be made in line with&#13;
Bank Group procedures. The experts must have extensive experience in opencast mining and be familar&#13;
with geo-mining conditions in Gondowana rock formation in India. The panel is expected to be constituted&#13;
by July 31, 1996. It will submit its report by December 1996.&#13;
Panel of experts to review the policies and implementation of environment and social mitigation plans&#13;
64.   This project is viewed by the Bank as environmentally contentious. OD 4.01 requires that the&#13;
implementation should be supervised and guided by a panel of environmental and social experts, that&#13;
would assure full adherence to project objectives and the Bank Groups Operational Directives. Consider-&#13;
ing that enviromnent and social impacts are strongly interdependent, the Association has recommended to&#13;
integrate the expertise in these two fields into one panel . The panel will consist of two social science&#13;
experts and two environmental experts, of which one for each subject will be expatriate and one local. The&#13;
panel would convene at regular intervals, not exceeding six months, to review the status of work in&#13;
progress against the respective policy and plans. Coal India would implement the recommendations of the&#13;
panel, after they have been reviewed by the Association.&#13;
65.   For the selection of experts, Coal India will follow the same procedure as indicated in para 63&#13;
above. The social experts must have expertise in issues related to resettlement of rural population includ-&#13;
ing indigenous peoples, rural finance (micro credit), public health, and should be familiar with NGO&#13;
activities in India. It is preferred that one member of the social group be a woman. Preference would be&#13;
given to prominent NGOs. Environmental experts must have wide experience in coal mining technology&#13;
and management and environmental management in coal mine operations. All panel members should be&#13;
recognized experts in their respective fields, exposure to international experience is preferred. The panel&#13;
will operate for about four years from early 1997.&#13;
66.   In addition to the above panels, the project would require intensive multi-disciplinary supervision&#13;
and monitoring. The different disciplines involved are mining engineering, civil engineering, environmen-&#13;

Box 3.2.1 Social and environmental review panel: Terms of Reference&#13;
A. Social Team&#13;
The panel will be guided by OD 4.30 and OD 4.20, the Resettimcent Actions Plans and the Indigenous Peoples Development Plans prepared&#13;
by Coal India, meetings with relevant project staff and project-affected people, and is expected to carry out the following activities (i) review&#13;
Coal India's resettlement and rehabilitation policy and the Resettlement Actions Plans, assess the progress Coal India is making in implementing&#13;
the policies and the Plans, including identifying areas where improvements arc needed and evaluate the extent to which restoration of project-&#13;
affected people's livelihood is achieved; (ii) review Coal India's policy statements on community development and tribal development in&#13;
particular, assess the progress Coal India is making in implementing the indigenous plans and evaluate the effects on indigenous communities&#13;
in the project area; (iii) review public health issues; (iv) meet with project-affected people, NGOs and interested parties in major coal fields;&#13;
and (iv) guide Coal India in the planning, implemcntation, monitoring and evaluation of resettlement and community development programs.&#13;
B. Environmental team&#13;
The panel will be guided by the sectoral environmental assessment, Environmental Action Plans, meeting with project teams and site visits.&#13;
It will focus on environmental impacts related to (i) air, water, land, noise and vibrations and (ii) coal mining environmental management.&#13;
The panel, in its review of the sectoral environmental assessment and Environmental Action Plans for the selected mines, will make sure&#13;
that implementation of the action plans would (i) bring the respective mines into full compliance with Indian rules and regulations, as well as&#13;
stipulations contained in the permits and consent letters issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the State Pollution Control&#13;
Boards, respectively and (ii) meet the requirements of the Bank's OD 4.01.&#13;
tal engineering, agronomy and forestry, and anthropology and sociology. During the first two years of&#13;
project implementation, six supervision missions are scheduled. The supervision missions would consist&#13;
of Bank Group staff and consultants to review afforestation of waste land and biological reclamation of&#13;
overburden dumps. In order to make this pioneering project successful, the Bank will have to allocate&#13;
more staff resources and consultants than is usually budgeted. Table 3.2.5 shows the estimated Bank staff&#13;
and consultant inputs during the 11 supervision missions between July 1996 and June 2001, which would&#13;
be equivalent to about 34 staff weeks per year. This is in addition to 10-12 Bank staff weeks required for&#13;
the review of progress reports, financial reports, and processing and prior review of over 250 procurement&#13;
documents.&#13;
Borrower's contribution to supervision&#13;
67.      Close supervision and monitoring will be the responsibility of the office of Director (Project &amp;&#13;
Planning) at the subsidiary companies, which is fully equipped with staff assigned to land acquisition,&#13;
resettlement and rehabilitation, environment, forestry, inining and mine safety. (See Figure 3.2.1) At&#13;
corporate headquarters in Calcutta, supervision and internal monitoring will be the responsibility of the&#13;
Project Monitoring Cell of the World Bank Projects Division. The main tool is a computerized project&#13;
management system which has been developed by the Cell. It will pennit the monitoring staff to follow up&#13;
on implementation activities on a regular basis and to discover potential delays early on. Based on the&#13;
yearly operational plans and quarterly mnonitoring reports from the field, they will guide and focus assis-&#13;
tance to the non-performing subprojects and companies. The Division experts will visit the field for&#13;
verification and feedback. Coal India will provide the Association with quarterly progress reports in a&#13;
standard format that track the physical implementation of various project components, procurement and&#13;
disbursement.&#13;

68.   The subprojects are widely scattered in 11 coalfields in five States. It is evident that the Bank's&#13;
supervision mission will not be able to visit all the subprojects even once a year, even larger projects&#13;
cannot be regularly covered. Therefore, it is proposed to engage a local consulting company with requisite&#13;
staff experienced in coal mining, mining environment, resettlement and rehabilitation of people affected&#13;
by involuntary displacement and rural development to visit all the subprojects at least once in every&#13;
quarter. Its reports will be made available to the World Bank Projects Division, the Government and the&#13;
Association. The costs of consultancy would be financed out of the proposed credit. The above arrange-&#13;
ments would be maintained for the duration of the project with the composition of experts and responsi-&#13;
bilities assigned in consultation with Association. The consultants will be selected following the Bank's&#13;
procurement guidelines on the subject for the employment of local consultants.&#13;

Annex 4.1 FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE COAL SECTOR&#13;
REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
I.    This annex summarizes the methodology and assumptions that were use to estimate financial and&#13;
economic rates of return of the individual mine-specific investments and the Coal Sector Rehabilitation&#13;
Project as a whole. The risks each mine-specific investment faces were taken explicitly into account.&#13;
Methodology&#13;
2.     The financial and economic analysis of each subproject was carried out based on constant Decem-&#13;
ber 1995 prices. Cost and revenue streams were estimated for the project implementation period 1997 to&#13;
2001. The major variables affecting the cash flows are, inter alia, the capital cost, operating cost, annual&#13;
production and the selling price of coal.&#13;
3.     Based on the available information on the nature of the variables and also on judgement, a prob-&#13;
ability distribution for each of the variables was selected to reflect its uncertainty. A Monte Carlo simula-&#13;
tion was then carried out to generate a range of likely values for the different variables. The aim was to&#13;
arrive at a realistic estimate of the financial and economic rates of return for each subproject taking the&#13;
mine-specific investments' specific risks into account. The simulation yielded a range of possible financial&#13;
internal rates of return (FIRRs), enconomic internal rates of return (EIRRs) and net present values (NPVs),&#13;
and the likelihood of achieving each of them.&#13;
Assumptions&#13;
4.     Table 4.1.1 summarizes the assumptions that were used for carrying out the financial and eco-&#13;
nomic analysis of the mine-specific investments.&#13;
Risk analysis&#13;
5.     The financial and economic returns of the proposed investment program are subject to several&#13;
uncertainties. To the extent that these uncertainties can be foreseen and quantified, they have been taken&#13;
into account in the financial and economic evaluation of the individual mine-specific investments. The&#13;
results of this analysis provide an indication of the risks that are associated with the investment program.&#13;
In addition, this analysis highlights areas where the implementing coal company can take steps to reduce&#13;
known risks. The following variables were taken into account in carrying out the risk analysis:&#13;
*   changes in price of coal,&#13;
*   delays in the implementation of the projects,&#13;
*   changes in the capital cost,&#13;
*   changes in the operating cost,&#13;
*   changes in coal output, and&#13;
*   non-realization of revenues.&#13;
Based on the current socio-economic environment in which the various implementing subsidiary coal&#13;

Item                              Financial analysis                                         Economic analysis&#13;
Capital cost                 The capital cost is based on Coal India's                  The financial costs were converted to&#13;
and the mission's estimates of the cost                   economic costs by netting out duties&#13;
components in the subprojects. The cost                    and taxes, expressing the input&#13;
estimates of the equipment are based on the               content at c.i.f prices and adjusting&#13;
standard price list which is published by                 local cost components by applying&#13;
CMPDI every year. This price list is a                     the standard conversion factor of 0.8.&#13;
compilation of information based on the&#13;
latest purchases made by Coal India. However, in&#13;
cases where no such purchases were made,&#13;
budgeted prices from the suppliers fonned the&#13;
basis of the estimates. The base month for the&#13;
estimate is December 1995. The capital cost of the&#13;
individual subprojects includes applicable taxes&#13;
and duties, but does not include and physical&#13;
contingency. All costs have been converted to&#13;
their equivalent in 1996 US dollars.&#13;
Operating cost               The operating costs are based on Coal India's               The cost was derived from the financial&#13;
estimates of the operating costs for each                  cost by excluding all taxes and duties&#13;
subproject. These estimates have been derived              and a standard conversion factor of 0.8&#13;
from the schedule of additional coal                      was applied to the local cost component.&#13;
production, overburden removal, and&#13;
deployment of the machines and also taking&#13;
into account fixed and variable components&#13;
of unit operating cost. The unit operating cost&#13;
estimates, i.e. cost/m3 are comparable with the&#13;
mines of similar nature currently in production&#13;
in Coal India For replacement projects, however,&#13;
a variable cost/incremental operating cost of Rs 19.5/m'&#13;
(USSO.61/ml) has been taken uniformly for all projects.&#13;
This cost reflects the present variable cost/m3 in the&#13;
opencast mines of Coal India. Interest on working capital&#13;
is based on historical levels of working capital requirements&#13;
equivalent to 4 months operating cash expenses.&#13;
Coal production              For the new coal mines, mines under construction&#13;
and the expansion mines, the expected increase of&#13;
coal output was taken as the major benefit from&#13;
the subprojects. For projects where replacement&#13;
equipment is proposed to be financed, the likely&#13;
shortfall in coal output that would occur if equipment&#13;
was not replaced was taken as the major benefit. The&#13;
assessment of the shortfall in production was based&#13;
on the recent average annual productivity of each&#13;
type of equipment in Coal India.&#13;
Coal price                   Expected revenues are based on ex-mine selling prices      Benefits were calculated on the basis of&#13;
authorized as of December 1995 and additional coal        the additional coal production, valued at&#13;
production attributable to the investment in the project.  cif import prices of coal at selected&#13;
Indian ports plus inland freight costs to&#13;
consumers and adjusted for equivalent&#13;
heat values, less the freight charges for&#13;
delivery of coal from mine mouth to the&#13;
same consumers.&#13;

Table 4.1.2: Selection of probability distribution&#13;
Variable               Selectedprobabilit.y                           Reasonsforselection&#13;
distribution&#13;
Coal price                       Normal              The current selling price is the most likely value and any small increase or decrease&#13;
above or below the current price is equally likely. In constant terms the price is more&#13;
likely to be in the vicinity of its current value than far away from it.&#13;
Project implementation delay     Triangular          In the present analysis, delay has been defined through a factor which slows down the&#13;
pace of the year-wise capital investment and as a result, in extreme case, the coal&#13;
production program is deferred by one year. This factor can thus have a minimum,&#13;
maximum and most likely value. The values near the minimum and maximum are less&#13;
likely to occur than those near the most likely value.&#13;
Capital cost                     Custom              This variable cannot be described by any known distribution. There is a higher&#13;
probability of completing the project at an investment lower than the estimated capital&#13;
cost. This assumption was based on the earlier experience of Coal India where&#13;
procurements were made through ICB.&#13;
Operating cost                   Normal              At constant prices, the present cash cost of production is the most likely value, and a&#13;
small increase or decrease about this mean is equally likely. Though the overall cost of&#13;
production in Coal India has been falling at 2% annually in real terms for the last three&#13;
years, it is felt that this downtrend may be offset by higher costs of working deeper&#13;
reserves of coal.&#13;
Production                       Custom              Because of the uniqueness of each project and different factors affecting production,&#13;
this variable could not be defined through any known distribution. Therefore, a custom&#13;
distribution was chosen to reflect the specific nature of the variable. In all cases&#13;
production lower than the target was assigned a much higher probability compared to&#13;
production above the target.&#13;
Non-realization of revenue       Triangular          Based on the experience of realization of coal sale dues, it is seen that the total&#13;
realization, when expressed as a percentage of total sales, can have a minimum,&#13;
maximum and most likely value. Individual values are expected to fall within this&#13;
range.&#13;

Impact of the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project&#13;
8.    It is apparent that significant external inputs are needed to transform Coal India into a commer-&#13;
cially viable enterprise. These comprise an infusion of external finance of about US$1 billion, decontrol of&#13;
domestic coal prices, phasing out of subsidies to loss-making subsidiaries, reduction of surplus labor, and&#13;
conversion of arrear loans and interest liabilities into equity by Government. These measures work in&#13;
tandem to ensure that the end objective is achieved. None of these measures in isolation can produce the&#13;
desired effect. Projections of production, profit before tax and the debt service coverage ratio are illus-&#13;
trated in Figure 4.1.1. The effect of capital restructuring, coal price decontrol, and the Coal Sector Reha-&#13;
bilitation Project are also shown. It is clear that without the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project Coal India's&#13;
production will stagnate, its profits will decline and its ability to service its debt will be undermined. The&#13;
proposed project, together with the other measures, is necessary and needs to be implemented soon to&#13;
enable Coal India to achieve long-term financial stability. Coal India will in turn need to revise many of its&#13;
internal policies and practices if the beneficial effect of these measures are to be sustained.&#13;
9.     A major objective of the Coal Sector Rehabilitation project is to ensure that each of Coal India's&#13;
subsidiaries is financially viable. This will require that:&#13;
*   cross-subsidization through the mechanism of an artificial retention price is phased out,&#13;
l   capital and other investments are made on the basis of commercial considerations,&#13;
*   operating efficiency is significantly improved, and&#13;
u uneconomic operations are identified and closed.&#13;
The fundamental change in strategic direction assumes added importance in view of the Government's&#13;
intention to completely phase out all budgetary support to Coal India in the near future.&#13;
Coal India's base case financial projections&#13;
10.    The financial model is structured to provide an income statement, balance sheet and funds flow in&#13;
current prices for a 10 year period, the base year being 1995. The statements are generated for each coal&#13;
producing subsidiary. The results are consolidated to reflect the overall financial position of Coal India&#13;
(except for small units directly managed by Coal India and CMPDI). The financial model is based on:&#13;
*   Estimated production capacity, manpower, stripping ratio, labor productivity, average coal&#13;
price realized, wage cost per employee, variable and fixed operating expenses, interest and&#13;
depreciation, and a provision for compensation per person for accepting early retirement.&#13;
The average coal price includes the value added resulting from washeries and other down-&#13;
stream operations. Production capacity is identified separately for underground and opencast&#13;
mines and includes, in some cases such as ECL, uncommissioned capacity created through&#13;
substantial investments in prior years.&#13;
*   Assumptions have been made regarding likely trends of physical performance, manpower&#13;
reduction, the cost of creating new capacity and servicing of existing capacity through&#13;
replacements, working capital management and likely enhancement of bank credit, various&#13;
sources of borrowing and other financial assumptions relating to the impact of the expected&#13;
change in average quality of production on realizable price, tax adjustment for depreciation,&#13;
and the notional capital restructuring.&#13;
*   Coal prices which will be progressively deregulated: coking coal and superior grade non-&#13;
coking coal by September 1996 and other grades by September 1997. Price increases due to&#13;

Coal India's potential ability to capture part of the existing market premium for coal quality,&#13;
has been assumed for each subsidiary company in the event of price decontrol.&#13;
Cross-subsidization has been phased out over a period of six years. The success of these&#13;
measures, such as the release of grants for implementing Coal India's voluntary retirement&#13;
program, debt forgiveness, price increases due to decontrol, and the intemal steps initiated&#13;
by Coal India to improve efficiency, should enable ECL and BCCL to reduce their depen-&#13;
dence on cross-subsidization over this period.&#13;
*     It has been assumed that the borrowing capacity for each subsidiary, besides being subject to&#13;
a limit of 60% of debt to total capital, will be constrained by an annual borrowing limit&#13;
which will be significantly lower if the coal sector loan does not take place.&#13;
a     The model provides for estimates of domestic and foreign inflation, inflationary adjustment&#13;
of coal price, and a wage index reflecting adjustment for inflation and the possible outcome&#13;
of wage negotiations which are held once every four years. Further exchange rate deprecia-&#13;
tion arising from differential rates of inflation has also been taken into account.&#13;
11.      The base case financial model demonstrates the possibility of all the companies attaining long-&#13;
term financial viability, provided sufficient loan capital is made available and a number of reforms and&#13;
remedial measures are taken by the Government and Coal India. These measures are summarized below:&#13;
ACTION BY THE GOVERNMENT&#13;
i.    conversion of liabilities of loan and interest into equity by March 1995;&#13;
ii.   deregulation of coal price - coking and superior grade non-coking coal by September 1996&#13;
and other grades by September 1997;&#13;
iii.   continuing support by way of grant for implementation of VRS in ECL and BCCL over the&#13;
period of 1995-96; and&#13;
iv.   Ensure noninterference in Coal India's efforts to regulate coal supplies on commercial&#13;
considerations, i.e. timely payment and insistence on inventory buildup by consumers.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Coal Sector Environmental and Social
            Mitigation Project will assist India in making coal
            production more environmentally and socially sustainable.
            The project comprises the following three components: 1) a
            capacity building component, which will consist of technical
            assistance and the provision of funds for studies and
            training aimed at enhancing India's capacity to deal
            more effectively with the environmental and social issues of
            coal mining operations; 2) an investment component which
            will be used for the implementation of Environmental Action
            Plans, Rehabilitation Action Plans and Indigenous Peoples
            Development Plans for the 25 mines slated to receive
            financial assistance under the project; and 3) a social
            remedial action component which will provide funds for the
            preparation and implementation of social remedial action
            programs for the four coal mine projects which have received
            Bank support in the past.
