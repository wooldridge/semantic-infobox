                  A OOHVERSATION WITH IRVING S. FRIEDMAN, 1                 a very desirable environment, whereas the Fund had a tradition of being&#13;

&#13;
                                                                            of view, for accepting the idea that people could differ about very&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     May we begin with your aaying a bit about your career in the    important things.     There was no such thing as the Managing Director of&#13;
&#13;
International Monetary Fund?                                                the Fund ever telling anybody whAt to think.     It was just the reverse.&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:    My asaociation with the International Monetary Fund was a      The function of the staff of the Fund was to try to formulate policy,&#13;
&#13;
very happy period in ay life.    We were deeply iuvolved in liquidity       or apply it to a particular case.    The job of the Managing Director was&#13;
&#13;
di1cuasions, a amall group of us.     I bad particular responsibility for   to take the advice of the staff. to help modify it, improve it, etc.,&#13;
&#13;
the International Adjustment Mecbaniaa which I felt at the time was         negotiate it in a diplomatic sense or deal with it on the Executive&#13;
&#13;
being neglected, both outside and inside the Fund, as being really          Board level.     But there was no concept of a leader at the top telling&#13;
the core of the   proble~   Too much eaphaais wa1 being given by many to    the 1enior staff what to think.&#13;
&#13;
aeaaurements of international liquidity and to trying to predict what               We in the Fund bad the notion that the Bank was run by the&#13;
&#13;
aagnitudes of international liquidity would be needed in the future.        Pre1idenL      Tbe people of the Bank staff did what the President told&#13;
&#13;
These two streaaa of work were going on aiaultaneou1ly within small         them to do; they even thought what the President told them to think.&#13;
&#13;
group1.   At that tiae I vas alao very happy in â&#128;¢Y peraonal relations       In fact, they all wore black Homburg bats because    M~   Black did.   We&#13;
&#13;
with the Fund, becauae I bad known Pierre Paul Schweitzer for many          used to be pretty scornful of this kind of ezistence.     Keep in mind,&#13;
&#13;
years and bad a great regard and respect for him; he ia an extremely        Bob, that probably as much or aore than any single person in the world,&#13;
&#13;
nice person with whom to work.     Be had pretty jaundiced views about      I used to be introduced in Japan as Mr. Fund.    I was sort of a&#13;
&#13;
what would happen to anybody over at the World Bank and what the            prototype staff member of the Fund, and I shared this scorn of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
differences between working at the Bank and the Fund would be like.         in this sense of the word -- not for ita objectives or its purposes or&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Bow did be characterize those differences?                      even what it did, but for the image of a Bank staff member.      We all&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     Mainly be thought of the World Bank as being run like an      used to feel sorry for fellows who worked in the Bank, as compared with&#13;
&#13;
American business--by captains of induatry-- which he didn't regard as      the Fund.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 3                                                                              4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     May I ask this point, do you think that the Bank baa changed       Director is not someone who gives a line to the staff.      Quite the&#13;
&#13;
in that regard in the last ten yearet       Or is it still an operation        contrary.     Be takes hia line from the staff; he is a sort of bridge&#13;
&#13;
essentially like an American induetrial concern?                               between the etaff and the Board and feels free to modify a staff&#13;
FIIEDMAN:     1 think the Bank baa changed eou.iderably during the last        position.&#13;
&#13;
ten years, but life in the Bank ia still far froâ&#128;¢ what it vas in the                  For 14 years in the field of exchange rates, exchange&#13;
Fund, that ia the Fund that I knew.     (I don't want to aake the mistake of   restrictions, and use of the Fund resource&amp;, no recommendation went to&#13;
&#13;
an anachroniaa here:     I aa coaparing the Fund that I knew vitb the Bank     the Board that I didn't approve.     It was in my name--often it was also&#13;
&#13;
I know now.)     It could be that the Bank baa had an t.pact on the Fund.      in the name of another depart.ent director: the area department&#13;
&#13;
Maybe the Fund today is aore like the Bank, but the differences are            director and the legal department were the two most often associated.&#13;
&#13;
still pretty marked.                                                           Whenever I would ask the Managing Director of the Fund, ''Why don't ..l2l!&#13;
&#13;
        In your manuscript you were eaphaaizing that at some point in the      approve the paper?"    be would turn down the suggestion on the grounds&#13;
&#13;
early history of the Bank, at the time of McCloy, etc., the Bank became        that, as Cbairaao of the Board as well as the Managing Director of the&#13;
&#13;
presidential-led sort of the U.perial aoverei&amp;nty as against the Board.        Fund, he wanted to feel free at the Board level to suggeat some&#13;
&#13;
I think that was exactly the    ~pression    of those who worked in the        compromise.    That is what the Fund is all about; it is a forum for&#13;
&#13;
Fund.     You also note it is the Board which leads in the Fund, which ia      diacuaaiona of international monetary problema, and the guy in the&#13;
&#13;
exactly rigbt 1 and that baa tre.endoua Laplicationa for the Staff,            chair baa the leading position in suggesting that a staff&#13;
&#13;
because if you are workins for a colle&amp;iua, like the Executive Directors       recommendation be changed.    It ia not   ~   recommendation.   The only&#13;
&#13;
of the Board 1 there are a sreat many different pointa of view.      You are   responaibility he baa is that he choae the staff in the first place.&#13;
&#13;
not working for someone who juat has one point of view.       In fact part     He is responsible, therefore, for the.caliber of the work or for the&#13;
&#13;
of one'a akill in the Fund is recognition of different points of               integrity of the people, but not for specific recommendations.       That&#13;
&#13;
view.     You try to get out of the staff a prerecognition, or                 was something that caae from the staff.     Often, of course, he would&#13;
&#13;
precognizance, of these different points of view.      A Fund paper is         play a role in these recommendations, and once they were made, be&#13;
&#13;
better because it baa already anticipated the conflict that is going to        would be free to change them.&#13;
&#13;
develop at the Board level.     So the idea of having a point of view                 In the Bank, to this day, every recommendation that goes to the&#13;
&#13;
different from the management is taken for granted.       The Managing         Board is made by Mr. McNamara.     No staff member's name is even&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                                                  6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
mentioned in a recommendation.      Thia was done by Mr. Woods before bia          Oxford Don, and he couldn't get it through.    And this was so even&#13;
&#13;
and Mr. Black before   b~,   ao tbia ia not an innovation of Mr. McNamara.         though Per Jacobbson was probably the moat powerful Managing Director&#13;
&#13;
Tbere eziata in the Bank the idea that the Bank President runs the                 we ever bad in the Fund.     His were the years of the great successes,&#13;
&#13;
Bank, not the Board.     Tbe President civea the line to the staff.     Tbe        and yet he didn't have enough strength to do this.&#13;
&#13;
staff are hi1 principal lieutenaota.      Tbey are aleo his principal                        In the World Bank, on the other hand, Mr. McNamara can reorganize&#13;
&#13;
advisors.   But the leadership of the Bank ia a prelideotial type                  the whole Bank and appoint upteen new vice presidents; he can go ahead&#13;
&#13;
leadership, whereas the leadership in the Puod, I think to tbia day, is            with a    min~    concern about what member countries think, because they&#13;
&#13;
a kind of collegial leadership, both on the Board level, and as it gets            continue to accept the point that you made in your manuscript -- that the&#13;
&#13;
reflected in the staff.      In the Bank there ia a hi&amp;b premiwa--aod I            president is supposed to run the Bank.     It is kind of odd, too, because&#13;
&#13;
think I can aay this even for publication--there ia a high premiua in              there are aany dual directors, the same individuals representing&#13;
&#13;
agreeing with the Bank President.      If you want to survive under Black,         countries, who, when they are in the Fund, insist on the prerogatives&#13;
&#13;
or Woods, or McNamara, to take the ones that I have had some                       of Executive Directors, but when they come to the Bank may say&#13;
&#13;
sensitivity to--particularly under Woods and McNaaara--it makes a great            soaetbing about prerogatives but do not insist upon them.     It just&#13;
&#13;
deal of difference whether you agree with the President and whether he             makes for a very, very different type organization:     the Bank does not&#13;
&#13;
thinks you are a nice guy.                                                         encourage the saae freedom of different points of view as does the&#13;
&#13;
       In the Fund I saw Mr. Jacobbson for three years trying to choose a          Fund.&#13;
&#13;
succeaaor to Eddie Bernstein as Director of the Economic Research                  OLIVER:     To come back to your own move from the Fund to the Bank, I&#13;
&#13;
Departaent of the Fund and not succeeding, not having enough authority             understand that ten years ago, when you came to the Bank, the Fund&#13;
&#13;
even to appoint a department director, because the depart.ent director             really had more involvement at the policy level in its various member&#13;
&#13;
was so.eone be bad to appoint in consultation with the Executive                   countries than the Bank did.     Why was this so, and did it relate to why&#13;
&#13;
Directors of the Fund.     In this ease, be had wanted an Englishman, and          Mr. Woods asked     you to come to the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
the Executive Directors did not see why it should be an Englishman.           It   FRIEDMAN:     The Fund, under its Articles of Agreement, bas a fairly&#13;
&#13;
was aa simple aa that.     He spent years trying to get a particular               prescribed role.     It was set up as an international monetary authority&#13;
&#13;
Englishman, who I can say off the record was Morris Allen, who was the             with respect to exchange rates and exchange restrictions, and given, as&#13;
&#13;
chief intellectual of the Bank of England at this time and bad been an             you so well know, financial resources to help countries cope with&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        7                                                                               8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
balance of   payment~   difficulties.    In the Article 14 consultations, we                it was just the reverse-- it refused to agree to the paper value&#13;
&#13;
bad to make a basic decision-- the matter c..e up in about 1951 --                       change, as you undoubtedly know, on the grounds that it was inadequate:&#13;
&#13;
Vhat did it mean to have an International Monetary Fund?           What did it           they wanted to see a greater devaluation.     They didn't think it would&#13;
&#13;
really mean in practice?      There were many people (people as                          correct the fundamental disequilibrium in the French balance of&#13;
authoritative aa Loui1 Razainaki, for ex..ple, who bad been at Bretton                   paymenta, and, as events proved, the Fund's judgment was quite right at&#13;
Woods, who was not only oae of the leading architects of Bretton Woods                   the tiae.     The idea vas that you could sort of blackball a country.&#13;
but also a very thoughtful peraon and extre.ely devoted to the Monetary                          It came up in another way this tUDe and bad a lot to do with what&#13;
Fund -- so this vaa not a que1tion of boetility to the Fund) who really                  happened in the Bank later.     The experience of the Fund is that the&#13;
believed that the way you conducted an Article 14 consultation on so-                    autoaaticity concept of the Fund breaks down; when you try to work on a&#13;
&#13;
called transition arrangementâ&#128;¢ was that you left it for the country to                   basis of eligibility and ineligibility, you got into a black and white&#13;
&#13;
write a letter to the Fund aaying, "We do or do not find ourselves in a                  list; the Fund spent nearly two years trying to decide who should be&#13;
&#13;
position to remove 1oae of tbe1e exchange re1trictions," and then just                   eligible and who should be ineligible.     It was clear that in a period&#13;
&#13;
sign the letter -- the governor for the Central Bank or tbe governor of                  of balance-of-payments crises, which we had at this time, which some&#13;
&#13;
the Fund; â&#128;¢nd that if the Fund differed, it would â&#128;¢end a letter back to                  people were calling a permanent dollar shortage, that if you make&#13;
                                                               1&#13;
the country aaking the â&#128;¢o-called repreeentation, saying,           ~e       think that   everybody automatically eligible you are going to run the Fund out of&#13;
&#13;
you could withdraw -.ore of your rutrictiona, 11 and if you don't the                    money.     The Anglo-American loan experience bad shown how fast this&#13;
&#13;
Fund should aend in a whole seriea of eanctions.                                         could happen.     On the other hand, the only way the Articles had&#13;
     My conviction about this waa at that tiae baaed upon the very                       prescribed for making a country   ~    have automatic use was to declare&#13;
&#13;
sorry experience of the Fund in the firat few years when we were a                       it ineligible.     You could never get the Board of the Fund -- that is&#13;
&#13;
secluded, ignored inatitution.      The only dramatic event was the 1948                 why it i1 UDportant that it was run by the Board       you could never get&#13;
&#13;
event with France when we had turned down a par value.        (I think the               this collection of countries to put anybody else on the black list.&#13;
&#13;
French to this day have never forgiven us for turning down their                         They are always protecting the others in order to protect themselves,&#13;
&#13;
proposed par-Â¥alue.)      It is the only case in the history of the Fund of              and ao we had no use of the Fund resources to apeak of during this&#13;
&#13;
turning down a par value change.        And that was on the grounds, oddly               time.&#13;
&#13;
enough in light of the early discussion about the Fund being too rigid                            I had in my job as Director of the Exchange Restrictions&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 9                                                                              10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Department this broad policy responsibility.      Before that. aa you know,    How can you make a judgement as to whether or not a country is making&#13;
&#13;
Bob, I bad been policy aaaietant for the Deputy Managing Director.             progress towards creating the preconditions for convertibility without&#13;
&#13;
Thia gave me direct acceaa to the Deputy Managing Director and the             going to the country, without talking to people, without doing serious&#13;
&#13;
right to ait on what waa a co.mittee of a half a dozen top staff               economic work, without building an economics staff?"&#13;
&#13;
people.     I waa a meaber of tbia group.    In that capacity, I bad written        At thia point the staff on the Fund was very small.        I wrote&#13;
&#13;
a memorandum to the Managing Director of that time, Caaille Gutt 1             papers on Iran and Ethiopia's par values from the Encyclopaedia&#13;
&#13;
saying that I thought the way to overcome tbia problem waa to relate           Britannica, for example, in 1947.     I wrote at that time about 21 par&#13;
&#13;
the uae of Fund resources to the efforts the countriea were making to          value papers, mostly from tertiary sources, because we didn't have&#13;
&#13;
achieve precondition&amp; for a atrong and acceptable balance of payments          first-hand relations with countries.     That was another shocker, indeed.&#13;
&#13;
position.    Tbeae, in turn, were necessary aa precooditiona for having        I vas alvaya pushing at that time the point, and now I bad a chance to&#13;
&#13;
either a par value -- or having the kind of par value the Fund really          iaplement it because I bad a department of my own, that what we had to&#13;
&#13;
wanted 1 which waa one that would really perform ita appropriate               do vas to have direct relations with countries.     And we should stop&#13;
&#13;
balance-of-payment role or would enable borrowers to look at the Fund          pretending that we could know about a country by sitting in Washington&#13;
&#13;
resource&amp; aa teaporary rather than permanent, becauae you could think          reading   the~        Ecopowjst --that was the best source that we had,&#13;
&#13;

idea.     Then Mr. Gutt meets with Mr. Runcouncil meantime, and something      OLIVER:     Did you have any difficulty getting the cooperation of the&#13;
&#13;
comes out that is called Gutt-Overby uae of the Fund resources, which          varioua governments in allowing the staff of the IMF to visit their&#13;
&#13;
is nov what we call the Credit Surcharge Policy.                               countries to ask searching questions?&#13;
&#13;
          It is juat at this time that I went to the Board with a paper on     FRIEDMAN:     Ob, we certainly bad a lot of difficulties.    In the first&#13;
&#13;
how to organize the Article 14 consultations.      This enabled me to point    year, we had difficulties in two directions.     The first was to get the&#13;
&#13;
to that policy and say,    '~e   ought to relate this to our whole policy on   staff of the Fund to agree that this should be done.        Some of the staff&#13;
&#13;
bow to achieve convertibility occurrences.       Therefore our whole           thought that it was outrageous.     As a matter of fact, a very good&#13;
&#13;
exercise in the Article 14 conaultations can be related to bow to              friend of mine. a guy named Tony Weir, who was the director of the&#13;
&#13;
~plement     what we now call the Credit Surcharge Policy of the Fund.         European Department, resigned on the issue.     He said, "I will not be&#13;

&#13;
distinguished chap fro. the Netherlands.       He bad been chairman of the         Director of the Fund,    e~cept   to the London meeting -- the first Annual&#13;
&#13;
joint Benelux Monetary Union and vaa really among the three or four                Meeting was in London.     But that was the Governors, not the Fund staff.&#13;
&#13;
~at   eainent people in the Hetberlanda.      We had recruited him to become            I could tell you some interesting stories of some appeals I bad to&#13;
&#13;
a director of the European depart.ent.       Be an I were very good personal       make to individual countries, and our staff opposition was so strong&#13;
&#13;
frienda, but he 1aid, "Irvin&amp;â&#128;¢ tbia juat cauot work.         You cannot            that in the first year of consultations I personally bad to conduct or&#13;

&#13;
prepared to have aoaebody froa an international agency come to that                to chair a â&#128;¢eeting.     Only one other person in the Fund at the senior&#13;
&#13;
country and diacuaa with their authorities the appropriateness of their            level vas willing to chair a meeting and that was Jon Guenther.        The&#13;
&#13;
domestic policy.     It can't be done."    And J. W. Beyen, who later became       others just begged off.     One of them came to me and said that this was&#13;
&#13;
foreign minister, and vbo bad already been governor of the Central Bank            going to cause the collapse of the Fund, and when it collapsed it was&#13;

&#13;
in oppoeing my aeaorandua on the Article 14 consultations setting up               In the case of Australia and Hew Zealand it took nearly ten years&#13;
&#13;
the procedure vas, -rriedaan i1 proposing that our countries dance nude            before they would allow the first consultation mission.        The deal I&#13;

on this table.     I can assure you that the Hetherlanda will never dance          made with the Australians was,     Â·~ill   you consult if we promise not to&#13;

&#13;
because later on the Netherlands became the strongest aupporter of the             was then executive director for Australia and a very outstanding person&#13;
&#13;
concept of .ultilateral surveillance, but this was 1951-52, and within             and very devoted to the International Monetary Fund, agreed as long as&#13;

&#13;
accept anyone coaing froa the Fund.        The United Kingdom had never even       this Article 14 consultations.      That gives you some sense of what was&#13;
&#13;
allowed the Managing Director of the Fund to come to the United Kingdom            going on.&#13;
&#13;
officially.     In Camille Gutt's five years as Managing Director, as far          OLIVER:     I take it that at this period of history the Bank, as distinct&#13;

FRIEDMAN:     Oddly enough in soae respects the Bank was doing more than        then people like Andy Kamarck in the Bank had the job of editing and&#13;
the    Fun~   The Bank, for instance, in Coloabia in 1949, organized a          scrutinizing. so that by the time it came out it was a very fine job.&#13;

the Bank, but they were done under the auspices of the Bank.         The Bank           It is not until the 'SOa under the Article 14 consultations that&#13;
brought a team together and arranged the acceptability of the ciasion           we developed this program of reviewing the countries. developing the&#13;
in the field and so forth.    I remember talking to Dick Demuth about           staff capability of doing it. developing the acceptability to&#13;
this back in 1949.     I was working with the Deputy Managing Director and      governments that the Fund should make a recommendation about ita&#13;
was at that tiae fiercely jealous of the fact that the Bank was doing           policies.          Every part of this was fought step by step.           The first time&#13;
this, because I had the feeling that this vas the kind of thing that            --1 remeaber so clearly--when I decided why don't we try to include in&#13;
the Fund should do, not the Bank.       Dick Deautb's answer was the            our recommendations something about fiscal policy and wage policy, now&#13;
complete an1wer.     He said, "Look, Irving" -- it was very close to this.      taken for granted. we had a battle royal.                  The Board just revolted.&#13;
I am quite sure -- "you in the Fund are not doing anything and you have         What business did we have to say anything other than about exchange&#13;
left a vacuum, and we in the Bank are going to fill it.       When you start    ratel, exchange restrictions, or balance of payments?                   What were we&#13;
doing something it will be a different thing." And that was exactly             doing talking about fiscal policy and wages?                   This was fought through,&#13;
right.    It wasn't aa though we could say -- this was before the               accepted, and. after awhile, some of ita moat vigorous opponents, like&#13;
consultations, before we were sending missions to the field or                  the Dutch, became some of our moat vigorous supporters.                   By the end of&#13;
investigating countries in any serious way -- â&#128;¢twhy are you duplicating         the 1950s you could even move from               Ar~icle   14 to Article 8&#13;
our work?"     'lbe answer was siaply   that we weren't doing it. and the       consultations, for which there is no provision within the Articles of&#13;
&#13;
Bank stepped in..                                                               Agreement, on the grounds that by this time the countries found that&#13;
        The Bank did it sporadically. in the sense that it did it only for      the consultation technique was helpful both in keeping track of what is&#13;
a few countries.     It takes a long time to do each one.    Each one           going on in the world and exercising some kind of influence on each&#13;
becomes a major effort.      But on the other hand, the ones that they did      other's policies, and also rationalizing the Fund resources.&#13;
do became, and I think they atilt are, minor classics.       I remember some            It meant you could use the Fund resources in a sensible way very&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        15                                                                                    16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
quickly, because at any given time the Fund staff had bad recent first-               the Bank, ia it fair to say that the Fund was doing more detailed,&#13;
&#13;
hand experience with the country and could move rapidly in the field.                 systematic, country-by-country reporting than the Bank was doing?&#13;
&#13;
This kind of program just wasn't going on in the Bank.           It wasn't going      FRIEDHAH:     Yea.    What I found when I came to the Bank was that the Bank&#13;
&#13;
on then at all.    They still bad these individual country surveys, but               had the notion that you only knew about a country if you expected to&#13;
&#13;
there was nothing like an autoaatic, regular review of countries, with                make a loan to it, and only to the exteot that you needed information&#13;
&#13;
recommendations of policy, with both explicit or implicit perforaance                 for the loan.        In some caaea if the loan was,   let~a   say, for a second&#13;
&#13;
criteria of what was meaot by good perfor.ance, with a kind of longer                 stage of an electric generating project, you might not have to know&#13;
&#13;
run outlook of where the country was going, with an international                     much at all, because you bad already decided on the first stage.                  This&#13;
&#13;
judgment as to whether or not this represented reasonable international               is Argentina or Brazil.       Wheo I came to the Bank io      ~64   the Bank had&#13;
&#13;
behavior worthy of international support.                                             POt bad an economic review of Brazil for seven years.               Brazil was one&#13;
&#13;
     Much, Bob, of what began later in the Bank, both in terms of                     of the major--if I remember correctly--potential borrowers, but the&#13;
&#13;
organizing economic support, building staff proposals like the                        fact was it   waan~t    a borrower.   It had been put out in the cold as far&#13;

Supplemental finance Proposal, were very largely inspired by the                      as the Bank waa concerned, and, therefore, Why did we want to do an&#13;
&#13;
experience that 1 bad had in the lund.      1 could aee at first hand the             economic survey?       On the other hand, in the case of India and Pakistan,&#13;

difference, for example, betweeo doing a survey which was aore                        where the Bank had undertaken a leadership role in the India and&#13;

compreheoaive than anything we could do in the lund, Jmt ,Jmll .Jl21 .lu              Pakistan consortia, the Bank was doing very good economic work, because&#13;

&#13;
to Colombia or Brazil, he would go back again; and we could see that                  countries it was doing quite good economic work--two that come readily&#13;
&#13;
over that ten-year period of time between, say,      ~so   and   ~60,    by 1960 we   to mind are on India and Pakistan, but on most of the countries it was&#13;

to, who were regarded by the countries as being experts equivalent to                 OLIVER:     I should have thought that the basic explanation was still the&#13;
&#13;
their own, and in maoy cases, like Sture in the Fund, regarded by the                 same.     The Bank to this day does not send missions to Category I&#13;
&#13;
Fiona and the Austrians and the Greeks and the Turks as more expert                   countries, countries who are donors to IDA, whereas the Fund does,&#13;
&#13;
than virtually anybody in those countries.                                            because even the United States and the UK can have balance-of-payments&#13;

non-loan activity may really ..ke .ore of a contribution to the                      atill a very strange idea that when you talk about a country in the&#13;

the aurveys were published was a horrifyina idea because I didn't know               they never spoke about India, on the grounda that there is a kind of&#13;
bow you could aive confidential and really candid advice to coveru.enta              adversary relationship. that the Executive Director had a vested&#13;
on erroneous policies if the thins was soing to be published.             Some way   interest or a conflict of interest.        Their loan was being discussed&#13;

a bit of a feeling of an adversary relationship.                                     because you bad this advisory role.        In advising the UK, (if you do&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     Yea, I think that it exieta to this day.      My point is that I       thia and we provide a standby), we didn't think of the Fund as a&#13;
&#13;
think that it is part of thia whole question of whether the Bank is a                financial agency, but rather aa part of the UK bureaucratic,&#13;
&#13;
develo~nt      agency.     If you are a development agency, and you think of         administrative machinery, because the Fund was an international agency;&#13;
&#13;
yourself as a partner vitb the borrower, then of course you recognize                and at that point of time we were trying to be aa helpful to the UK as&#13;
&#13;
an advocacy role.        In the Fund 1 we all bad the same objective as a            possible in light of overall international policies.&#13;
&#13;
member country, aa.ely, to improve the country.          It wasn't an adversary             When I came to the Bank. I found that if I was sitting in the&#13;
&#13;
role in the aenae that what was your gain would have to be .y loaa.             I    Bank and thought that it might be a good idea if a country were to&#13;
&#13;
found many things like that when I caâ&#128;¢e to the Bank.          For ezample, I         switch from industry to agriculture. I would hesitate to say so on the&#13;
&#13;
was surprised to fiud that the Bank waited for others to come to .ake                grounds that I have to wait for them to come up with an agricultural&#13;
&#13;
loan proposal&amp;.                                                                      project.     Tbia struck me as very odd, and it was one of the reasons why&#13;
&#13;
     We had loua aince learned in the Article 14 and the Article 8                   I felt so strongly that what we bad to do was to have regular economic&#13;
&#13;
consultations in the Fund that the real         t~   for identifying the need        surveys oriented towards development rather than abort-run balance-of-&#13;
&#13;
for a drawing on the Fund vas during the Article 14 or Article 8                     payments in which (what later come to be called a pre-identification&#13;
&#13;
consultations, when we are looking ahead to what the country was                     stage) the economic mission would be able to bring to the attention of&#13;
&#13;
planning to do and what ita balance-of-payments outlook waa.            If we saw    countries:    maybe you want to be doing more in tourism, maybe you want&#13;
&#13;
that they might be in difficulty or that it would reinforce a pretty                 to be doing more in agriculture.         Incidentally, I deliberately mention&#13;
&#13;
good domestic    policy~    if they bad a stand-by with the Fund, we would           tourism because a member country might want to do more of the things&#13;
&#13;
just auggeat it.     We    wouldn~t   wait for countries to suggest the use of       that the World Bank itself      didn~t   finance, but that   wouldn~t   mean that&#13;
&#13;
the Fund    resources~    we suggested the use of the Fund resources,                the mission    shouldn~t   suggest it.    It might mean that the country then&#13;

although nothing in the Articles of Agreement said that we were                      got in touch with an international group like Hilton and said:             "By the&#13;

frequently.                                                                         were now convertible under Article 8.   My daughter, Barbara, knew this&#13;
        Of the various conversation&amp; I bad at that      t~,    one or two pop       too, since we always at home talked a lot about what I did.       She knew I&#13;
&#13;
into mind.        One vaa with .y daughter, wbo by this   t~    bad gone to         was a bit fruatrated about pushing the Fund towards s preoccupation&#13;
&#13;
college.     She had known about all the work that I bad done for the Fund          with helping poorer countries in a more meaningful way.&#13;
&#13;
in Japan and the United      ~ingdoa.    She still remembered when I had                 The other conversation, of more general interest, was the one with&#13;
&#13;
collapaed:        1 bad been sent out by the Fund to handle the Suez crisis         George Woods which I was telling you about.   Woods told me one day at&#13;
&#13;
without any inatructiona aa to what to do and out of that ca.e the                  lunch that he bad been called by President Kennedy before he. Woods,&#13;
&#13;
largest atory in the hiatory of the Fund--the firat aajor atory, in                 bad accepted the position of being successor to Eugene Black.      Kennedy&#13;
&#13;
fact.     I collapaed afterwards and waa aick for a year.        So I was           bad said to him something along the linea:    George, I ask you       they&#13;
&#13;
conaidered kind of s martyr to the era of couvertibility and rescuing               bad known each other -- to become the President of the Bank, the World&#13;
&#13;
the pound and stuff like that.          But my daughter'â&#128;¢ comment waa, "Dad, do     Bank, and the reason for it is that I tell you as one American to&#13;
&#13;
you really want to apend all of your life ju1t helping the richer                   another that I, as President of the United States, believe that&#13;
&#13;
countries of the world rather than the poorer countriea?           Don't you        everything that we in the United States have done since the end of the&#13;
&#13;
think it would be nice if you would spend some of your          t~e   helping the   War, including the Marshall Plan, to try to build a peaceful and stable&#13;
&#13;
poorer countrieat"                                                                  world is threatened by the growing gap between the poor and the rich&#13;
&#13;
        One of the things I had not succeeded in doing at the Fund, I was           countries.   If this is not solved, it is going to cause the collapse of&#13;
&#13;
trying to urge the Fund to become interested in a developmental role.               all of our policies, including the collapse of U.S. foreign policy.          We&#13;
&#13;
I first proposed the idea that we have a special creditors policy for               have to do something about this. and I think the World Bank. of all the&#13;

effect).     Thi1 is our choaeo instrument, and I want, you, George Woods,           think, perhapl 1 it was partly because--at least other people tell me--&#13;
to be the one to make the Bank be a bridge between the poor and the                  Dick bad had a lot to do with the International Development&#13;
rich countries.     Tben George Woods pointed to me and said, "And I want            Association; he must have done a lot of hard thinking in terms of the&#13;
you, Irving, to be the one who belpa me to build that bridge."                       IDA and the recognition of the poverty problem as against just the&#13;
        It waa also, by the way, at that time that be defined for me this            developmental problem.     He 1eemed to be quite receptive to this idea.&#13;
concept that he bad this very broad concept of the evolution of the                  We later bad very sharp differences of views on bow to do it, but it&#13;
Bank from a bank to a develop.ent finance agency and why be felt that                wasn't a question of whether we should do it.&#13;

people in the Bank could never do it.       Aa he put it,        'l'he people here           With the others I felt for a long time that they had no idea of&#13;

PRIEDMAH:     The &amp;taft of the Baok 1 the Senior Staff.     The only guy in          that.     These fellows--what they were proud of, they were very correctly&#13;
&#13;
the bank who val for this was Dick De.utb.       The only guy who had thia           proud of:     The Bank was an institution of the highest kind of personal&#13;

vision vas Dick Deautb.       It waa .y eenae of it that practically                 integrity, but the fact that you can go for seven years without making&#13;

everyone elae to a man on the top aide didn't go along, but they didn't              a loan to Brazil, or that you wouldn't make a loan to Greece because&#13;

&#13;
vision of the thing than Woods had.       Dick Demuth'â&#128;¢ idea wa1 that you            bother them.     They were just being good. bard-beaded bankers.     The idea&#13;
&#13;
build a few economistâ&#128;¢ into the place, and they write atudieâ&#128;¢--that is               that, in the meantime, you were losing the opportunity to help the&#13;
&#13;
the way you do it.      He bad no vision of country work and things like             economic or social development of a country, that wasn't their job.&#13;
&#13;
that.      But at least he shared the vision of the transformation of the                    Woods did have a vision of the Bank. and 1 honestly don't know&#13;

where he got it.     I don't know--he never quoted anybody.    I don't know    effort and felt that in some way you ought to tackle this with the same&#13;
&#13;
whether this was a personal inner vision that be bad from his own              degree of commitment and dedication and verve.          He wanted us to work&#13;

experience.     Remember be had worked on India for the Bank and he had        bard, work weekends, work nights.      He didn't find this.      He found what&#13;
&#13;
helped the Bank advise on the Suez Canali be adviaed the Bank on the           he called, disparagingly, a country club atmosphere.          How do you change&#13;

Philippines.     Be vas a close friend of Eugene Black, and Black went         thi1?     He threw the ball right into ay banda.    That is one of the&#13;

through in my opinion, a areat .etaaorpboail.     Ibe narrow banker of         reasons it became such a fascinating assignment.          He said,   11&#13;

1urpriae me, Bob, to find that actually thia could have been Black' a          want, any kind of people you want, because I am not going to do it with&#13;

viaion by the    tUae be left the Bank. Be became quite coavinced the          these people.     1 need new people who will do it. 11     He said, ''You go out&#13;
&#13;
role of the Bank waa different from what be believed earlier.                  and hire the kind of people that you think will do it.          And you will&#13;

1958-59.     I think you mentioned earlier, though, that when George Woods     contradiction, but on the face of it 1 it sounds as though the earlier&#13;
&#13;
came he felt that the staff of the Bank behaved too much like a country        statements that you were making about the ability of the President of&#13;
&#13;
club.     There was not enough concern for the fact that the Bank had no       the World Bank to run things in an American industrial management sort&#13;
&#13;
defaults, for example, which is 1yaptoaatic.                                   of way with a very subservient staff was contradicted by George Woods'&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     George Woods obviously bad a deep concern of bow do you          own experience.     You are now telling me that when he became President&#13;
&#13;
transform the Bank into a Development Agency.     Question one is, How do      of the Bank be was unable to move the staff to do the things that he&#13;
&#13;
you do it?     and two is, How do you do it with a minimum amount of hurt      wanted to do.&#13;
&#13;
to the people in the staff?     He was not a modern .anager.    He wasn't a    FRIEDMAN:     1 think that is right.   I think that the reconciliation of&#13;
&#13;
guy who vent in for tremendous restructuring.     He sort of added me on,      the contradiction was that--and it came up so many times in concrete&#13;
&#13;
so to apeak.     He left other people alone.   But bow do you work with the    cases--Woods clearly never felt confident that he could formulate how&#13;
&#13;
people you've got when Woods felt that they weren't really                     this transformation should take place.      He was always defeated in&#13;
&#13;
understanding what it vas he was trying to do?     Woods would point out       debate among a small group because they always knew more about&#13;
&#13;
that development should be like the war effort.       He had been in the war   development banking, in a sense, than he did.       He could always defeat&#13;

country that ia in financial difficulties on the grounds that it is one           principle that the word comes down from above, and, at the time of&#13;
&#13;
of our aembera.    Be did it by himself.   That kind of thing he was              George Woods, the Senior Staff, at least in conversations with him,&#13;
&#13;
comfortable about, becauae he was talking about things that be knew               were quite deferential to his point of view, but they weren't coming up&#13;
&#13;
about like access to llew York commercial banlta.     But when it caae to         with suggestions on how to do it.      In fact, when you made a suggestion&#13;
&#13;
theee other developing countriee and the new countriee in AfricL                  on how to do it, you usually came up with a good deal of opposition or&#13;

     Be knew a little bit more about India, eo he ueed to have hie own            criticism of what you were trying to do.     There were a number of&#13;

views on India.    In fact he waâ&#128;¢ the one who atarted the Bernie Bell             favorite projects of Woods and myself, for example, the Supplementary&#13;

Hiuion to India.     He knew the Indianâ&#128;¢ could use this kind of thing,            Finance Proposal, which was completely sabotaged by the Bank Senior&#13;

&#13;
Baaio, because be felt be knew a little bit about these thinga.                   FRIEDMAN:     You remember there was a proposal made by the British in 1964&#13;
&#13;
     But aoat of the world be felt very ignorant about, and I think               that something be done about export abort falls which would disrupt&#13;
&#13;
part of what be wanted froa a person like myself on the staff was a               development.     That was the language of the resolution.   The task was&#13;
&#13;
kind of intellectual aupport and guidance.     ..You really can't tell            given to the World Bank to come up With a proposal. The staff was first&#13;
&#13;
Irving Friedman about bow you can't do this with a country; be's been             to examine the merits of the idea, then, if they thought it&#13;
&#13;
doing it for 15 years."    That"'a what he would say to me.      ul need          meritorious, to come up with a proposal to implement it.       One of my&#13;
&#13;
someone, â&#128;¢â&#128;¢ he said, uthat has more reputation than anyone in this Bank,          first assignments was this proposal.     I saw in this idea of&#13;

going to have to be aggressive. This was a unanimous, untied                          That iâ&#128;¢ a very wise comment.      We might talk about that as to the wisdom&#13;
resolution.     Sure. the French would reserve their position on what the             of that hiatus or lacuna in the bank.          At this point you don't even&#13;
outcome would be. but everyone had voted in the end for it, including                 have it of potential borrowers.          So I explained this to Woods, just&#13;
the Eastern Europeao bloc countries and including all the developing                  like in the 1950-51 Article 14 consultations, that you opened the door&#13;

including financing ezport abort falls.           Countries~~~                        also to the private sector.      The private sector would start looking to&#13;

God-given opportunity to advocate annual reviews with countries or                    the developmental agency and knowing ibout countries.                     Woods just loved&#13;

regular reviews in response to the world coamunity asking for this kind               it. H.e said, "Oh, this was exactly it. â&#128;¢â&#128;¢        Be just raved really at that&#13;

OLIVER:     There were no annual reviews at all?                                              But opposition came from the Senior Staff,             Firat. they said it&#13;

FRIEDMAN:     Hone.   None at all.                                                    was a threat to project evaluation.          It would mean program lending.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Today there are annual reviews for â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢                                  Secondly, they said it would mean that IDA funds would be used for this&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:         â&#128;¢ everybody.       In a sense, we have regular reviews,             kind of purpose in&amp;tead of for project purposes.                They cornered me and&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                                   36&#13;

said, ''We can only go along, Irving. if you can commit yourself that             knew a lot -- on the grounds that they were so completely outraged by&#13;
any money for this purpose would otherwise not have come.''          That was     the idea--outrage is too strong a word, but they just found it&#13;
virtually asking for the impossible, because I didn't know how much               difficult to think that before a loan was made in the Bank, you first&#13;
money would coae to us otherwise.         I tried to suggest that   this would    had to have a judgment of the economic situation in the country; that&#13;
be an additional argument for a bigger amount for IDA because                     creditworthiness was oot just an arithmetic of the earnings to exploit&#13;
supplemental finance bad global aupport, but even that fell on barren             earnings for servicing but was actually a much bigger and deeper&#13;
soil.    They wanted firm coaaitaenu that in aoae way this thing would            concept of the whole economic outlook of the country; of the use of&#13;
be different.    They aaid,   Â·~ou   mean that we are going to undertake with     capital, and the kind of results it would produce, both domestically&#13;
countries to discusa their developaent prograas and share the                     and internationally; and that only an economic analysis could really&#13;
development reaponsibilitytu         My answer was, ~es, that is what we are&#13;
                                                    1&#13;
                                                                                  give you an end judgement on creditworthiness,        It   couldn~t   be as&#13;
going to do, because that is what we are in busineaa for.           Georse aays   though it was being ground out a tube on the basis of purely external&#13;
be wants ua to be a Development Finance Asency.         What do you think a       debt models in which you just related external debt to servicing.             All&#13;
&#13;
Development Finance Agency ia supposed to do?"                                    of this was going on all the time and people found it very difficult.&#13;
        At this time we had an Economic Committee and all this was related        OLIVER:     Let me ask you one quick question.   One additional objection&#13;
to it.    The Economic Comaittee and the Chief Econoaist of the Bank were         that they might have raised, it seems to me, is that in Eugene           Black~ a&#13;
&#13;
supposed to sit in on discussions of every country.         Every country was     period, the Bank could frequently chastise unruly borrowers, as it did&#13;
supposed to be reviewed and a judsaent passed on ita economic                     in the caae of Brazil and Turkey, by simply refusing to deal with the&#13;
situation, outlook, condition, behavior, performance, before any loan             country at all.     Your program of annual reports would have reduced the&#13;
proposal could come before the traditional Loan Committee.           But this     leverage the Bank bad.&#13;
was so painful to these people that they wouldn't even attend the                 FRIEDMAN:     Absolutely.   I was fully aware at the time, and I am fully&#13;
meetings of the Econoslic Coamittee.        1 issued a standing invitation to     aware now, that basic to the whole thing was, as I was saying before,&#13;
&#13;
these people, some of these senior people, to come and sit on the                 that you are not negotiating with a borrower, you are dealing with a&#13;
&#13;
Economic Committee, and not one of them ever accepted the invitation.             member country which has problems, and you are trying to help him.             I&#13;
&#13;
The economists came sod I got the Monetary Fund to send people, but I             don't negotiate with my doctor. In the Fund I was very proud to be&#13;
&#13;
couldn~t   get the loan staff to come and put in what they knew -- they           introduced as a money doctor.      What I wanted to be introduced as now&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       37                                                                             38&#13;

OLIVER: Would you say a bit .ore about the concept of a development                  never gets away from the probleaa of raising the money for what it&#13;
institution a1 distinct froa a bank and diacua1 eome of the aajor                    wants to do or, in the end, being judged to some extent by ita&#13;
events that occurred to help the World Bank evolve in that direction.                financial success or behavior.&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     I think. Bob 1 perhaps one way of getting at this, without                  This leads me to, perhaps, the main point, which is I think that&#13;
&#13;
trying to get at a very siaple definition. ia what was involved in                   in the transformation of the Bank from a bank to a development agency.&#13;
&#13;
trying to change the Bank froa a bank to a developaent finance agency.               or a development finance agency, the moat important single thing is&#13;
&#13;
the Bank ia a epecial kind of development agency.             Perhaps it ought to    probably the change in the testa of success.     In the case of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
be stressed that it is a development fjpâ&#128;¢pse agency ae again1t an                    what had been regarded as the teat of success vas the ability of&#13;
&#13;
enviroament agency. a Food and Agriculture Organization. a World Health              aanagement to float honda successfully.     that meant magnitudes and the&#13;
&#13;
Organization. or a UNESCO.       They are all multilateral development               rate of interest at which you can borrow, or opening up new areas for&#13;
&#13;
agencies, but the Bank doesn't ever escape from the fact that it ia a                investment. as in the United States which bad previously had&#13;
&#13;
financial agency.                                                                    prohibitions against international investment.    The really remarkable&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     It impressed me. though, in our earlier discussion, that you             and good job bad been done in the early years of Black's presidency in&#13;
&#13;
had helped evolve the Bank into a good deal more than what I would have              this respect.   Another test of success would be the magnitude of loans.&#13;
&#13;
called a development finance agency.        You were concerned with helping          Bow many loans did you make?     How many projects did you help finance?&#13;
&#13;
countries evolve development programs without necessary respect to what              Whether you were repaid promptly or whether you were repaid at all.&#13;
&#13;
part of the program the Bank itself would finance.                                   The degree to which you may have improved the creditworthiness of your&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:    Yea, I think that is right.         But I think that in being a         borrowers from a commercial point of view:     countries like Australia&#13;
&#13;
development finance agency you bad the benefit of what you want to do                and Japan. which first borrowed. could then sell their loans to private&#13;
&#13;
in the field of development as such and you have the financial                       investors, first with recourse to the Bank. but then without recourse&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
to the Bank.    Getting a borrower from the category of being a borrower      one of the first jobs he gave me to do, was to make a case for the IDA&#13;
&#13;
wboae loans could only be aold with recourse to the Bank to being a           replenishment, for the Second IDA Replenishment.    At that time IDA was&#13;
&#13;
borrower vboae loans could be sold without recourse to the Bank, like         only $250,000,00 a year.   Could we go for a much bigger IDA?    If so,&#13;
&#13;
Australia, ia froa a financial point of view 1 a banking point of view 1      bow would we justify it?   This got us involved in that whole dispute as&#13;
&#13;
a aucceaa because through your financial operations you have helped to        to bow much more development aasistance was needed by developing&#13;
&#13;
aake your borrower .are aelf-aufficient; be ia able to borrow more            countries, all sorts of different figures being put out by different&#13;
&#13;
broadly at lower rates of intereet 1 and ao on.                               kinds of authorities, like Prebiscb, UNCTAD, the UN, etc.&#13;
&#13;
     In a development agency. your teat of aucceaa ia really quite                 Conceaaional va non-conceasional solely from a banking point of&#13;
&#13;
different.     It doesn't deny any of these tbinga. but it really is          view really doesn't make very much difference in the whole dispute&#13;
&#13;
different.     The teat of 1ucceaa ia:   What do you contribute to the        between project lending and program lending.    From the banker's point&#13;
&#13;
development progreaa of the country?      The mere fact that the couotry ia   of view, you make a loan that is going to be repaid; be is not as&#13;
&#13;
servicing a loan. but. aa might very well prove to be the case in the         interested in the usage of the loan.   From the development point of&#13;
&#13;
future in many easel, the loan may be serviced at the expense of the          view, the usage of the loan. and using the usage as a leverage to help&#13;
&#13;
development prograa; if very scarce savings of the low-income community       a country perform better, even what you mean by a performance&#13;
&#13;
are being u1ed to service the debt that would be a bankers idea of a          criteria--all become different.   In a development approach your&#13;
&#13;
good thing. but, from the development point of view. it might be quite        performance criteria relate to your social and economic development&#13;
&#13;
a bad thing.     S~ilarly,   it would be a bad thing if you were servicing    objectives.   In performance criteria a narrow banking point of view&#13;
&#13;
a World Bank loan by using the foreign-aid aoniea that bad really been        might relate to such things as improving export capacity, or reducing&#13;
&#13;
earmarked for other aid.     So, therefore, in the development agency the     import needs, on the grounds that if you were more self sufficient you&#13;
&#13;
terms and conditions of loans become very     ~portent.   You become more     were going to become more capable of servicing debt.    That is a very&#13;
&#13;
concerned about whether you can give the money on concessional terms          narrow banking approach to debt servicing.     If you are a development&#13;
&#13;
than with whether or not you are going to be repaid on whatever terms         agency you are much more concerned with whether the leverage might be&#13;
&#13;
you extend.    The emphasis of the World Bank Group changed after it          to increase domestic savings as a means of increasing domestic&#13;
&#13;
became a Development Finance Agency.                                          investment.   Domestic investment may be in social capital, and, for&#13;
&#13;
     One of the first things I worked on under Mr. Woods' instructions,       some time, or maybe a long time, there is nothing to improve your&#13;
&amp;#12;                                               41                                                                            42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
export capacity--the result may even be to increase import needs.      But   way of the Bank--nothing unintelligent about it--very traditionally&#13;
the reason you are emphasizing 1ocial capital may be because, from the       commented in defense of the Bank;a program that we had never had a&#13;
viewpoint of a social and economic developaeot program, you have             default.   Woods stopped hha right in front of the whole Board and&#13;
identified that aa a very bi&amp;h priority need of the community, or of         turned to Burke and said, "Burke, I am not sure that ia anything to be&#13;
the nation.   All the teste of aucceBI becoae different, and I found         proud of, because we are a Development Finance Agency.    Do you really&#13;
that one of the hardest things in the Bank, it still is a very               think that a Development Finance Agency ought to measure its success by&#13;
difficult thing in the Bank, ia to turn away from the banking teats of       the lack of defaults?    We ahouldn;t be that concerned with whether a&#13;
success to developâ&#128;¢ent teats of 1ucceaa.   I think it ia partly because      country is able to service a loan.     We should be more concerned with&#13;
it is so bard to â&#128;¢eaaure the contribution of any one external agency to      what good it is doing for the country."    Woods said this to the&#13;
the developaent aucceaa or failureâ&#128;¢ of any country.     In some ways it i1   astoni1bment of many of the Executive Directors who bad never heard a&#13;
an act of faith.                                                             Preaident of the Bank say thiâ&#128;¢ in front of what was really all the&#13;
     In the Bank, for example (I may skip a little), one of the end          member countries of his Board without asking them to keep it&#13;
product&amp; of all thia ia not talking about the aaount of foreign              confidential or anything like that.     Coming as it did from a fellow who&#13;
exchange the Bank Ieoda, but trying to aeaaure what part the Bank playa      waa preeminately a banker in terms of his own experience and&#13;
in tbe total iavestment prograa which is related to the foreign              background. â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ So this came up in many different ways.     This is one&#13;
exchange obtained by the   Ba~   In some way you are trying to get a         way of looking at it.&#13;
better aeaaure than the narrow measure of the Bank money itselL      Still        Tbe other way is that if you were trying to transform the Bank&#13;
they are all inadequate measures, because things like whether or not         into a development agency, there are certain things that you very&#13;
Pakistan is kept together or whether it falls apart is never measured        clearly have to do.     One is that you have to get much more concesaional&#13;
by any of these things, and that might be more important than the            asaistance.   Secondly, you have to develop an economics staff, and by&#13;
development of a country, even then the broadest measure starting from       the why here I include as economists also population experts,&#13;
&#13;
the banking point of view.                                                   urbanologists, foreign trade experts, indeed, even sociologists--! am&#13;
     1 think I told you an anecdote about this point.    Woods               not using economists in the narrow sense of the word, but as against&#13;
wsa presiding at a Board meeting.   The Chairman of the Loan                 engineers 1 lawyers. accountants, and what might be considered the&#13;
Committee, who at that time was Burke Knapp, in the very traditional         normal intellectual input of a Bank.     You have a much broader kind of&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 43                                                                            44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
intellectual input in a developaent agency.                                   bit of a Statistics Division.    That's all.   I don't think there were 20&#13;
&#13;
        We bad to develop an econoaic program of the kind that we were        of them.    Within four years I had recruited over 200 people for the&#13;
foreshadowing in country reviews on a ayateaatic baaia.     We needed a       general economics staff and then insisted. not always successfully,&#13;
definition of what is a country review.     We bad great debates about        that there ought also to be important economic staffs within the area&#13;
&#13;
that.     From a banking point of view, a country review ia adequate if it    departments that were essentially lending depdrtments.     Even to this&#13;
&#13;
gives you the baaia to aake a loan.     From a development point of view.     day this is a great issue within the Bank.     To this day. in my opinion.&#13;
&#13;
a country review is only adequate if it helps you judge the development       the economic capability of our area work is deficient because loan&#13;
&#13;
program and development policies and their    ~pleaentation   and helps you   officers still find it bard, because of all the tradition, to accept&#13;
&#13;
give advice on how to .odify these things and adapt thea to changing          the idea. that, when you actually get down to the hard out of making a&#13;
&#13;
conditions.     Tbe first one i1 a very una.bitioua type of review.   The     loan, an economic officer is not just a background or useful person, he&#13;
&#13;
second one ia eztreaely ambitious.                                            ia a vital part of the intellectual input on the desirability of the&#13;
    Indeed, we bad soon to put a lLait on the number of people we could       loan.&#13;
&#13;
spare on a miaaion because we found that--well. we had people like                     It came up just yesterday in a lecture I was giving.     Just&#13;
&#13;
Abraaovic heading missions of 25 econoaists on one country.      Now this     yesterday I was talking about development banking and the person in&#13;
&#13;
just wasn't practical when you are talking about trying to do this for        charge of the banking department of our Development Finance Corporation&#13;
&#13;
80 or 90 countries.     The first kind of review you could literally do       aade the point that what Irving Friedman bad said about a development&#13;
&#13;
with one person; one person and a statistical assistant could do the          finance agency -- development banking against banking -- was quite&#13;
&#13;
narrow kind of review--a simple background as to why you are aaking a         right.     As a matter of fact, he said, if you went around and talked to&#13;
&#13;
new loan to a development institution like the Pi.ento Corporation of         the people in the Bank, you wouldn't Jigure they were interested in&#13;
&#13;
Cbile.     You weren't really passing on to Chile a development program or    development at all.     He said they are still interested in the&#13;
&#13;
outlook or long-term capital suggestions. all of which are involved           magnitudes of loans that they make and in the projects they are&#13;
&#13;
when you talk about s development program including the strategy and          financing, though they try hard to keep in mind that they are supposed&#13;
&#13;
implementation of policy.     So we had to develop our economics staff.       toÂ·be a development bank and not just a bank.     So these things are not&#13;
&#13;
        We had a few general economists who were not involved in projects.    easy to accomplish.&#13;
&#13;
There was a Commodity Division. an External Debt Division. and a little               Another thing that was interesting at that time in this&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     45                                                                                 46&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
transformation, and I think it ia atill valid, we started a process                     point where you started to ask yourself such questions as,    ~ell.   what&#13;
that still baa a long way to go to work itaelf out, and that vas taking                 about if it causes eye disease, like the Volta River did?     What if it&#13;
&#13;
an economic approach to policy queltionaa      For example. on projects va              creates an eÂ·nviro'OIIlent in which too many people will flock to the&#13;
&#13;
program lending: in the earlier years it was really a practical                         cities and you get overpopulation?    What if we are encouraging&#13;
&#13;
question.    A country like France caae alone and aaid, We want to import               excessive population in the country and we are doing nothing on family&#13;
&#13;
tbia, thia, and this.     We need foreiau exchance in this and tbia.             Will   planning?   All of a sudden economics gets involved in project work.&#13;
&#13;
you give it to uat     The initiative c..e fraa thea.         Indiana would co.e        You are nov millions of light years away from the sort of thing that a&#13;
&#13;
acroaa with ao-called industrial    ~port   loan1.        We need tbia to keep          bank considers. or which the World Bank bad ever considered.&#13;
&#13;
our capacity going,     we're abort of foreign exchanse. and we don't want                   As late as 1967, Bob, I could not hire a population expert at the&#13;
&#13;
to go to the Fund; we can't afford to go to the Fund.            How about doing        Bank because our traditional officers. whom I had to contend with in&#13;
&#13;
it?   We'll call it an industrial loan.                                                 this sort of thing, in spite of the support of the President. said&#13;
&#13;
      The aoment you get economists involved, they want to know which is                there is no place in the World Bank for a population expert.       This&#13;
&#13;
better fro. the point of view of the development strategy of the                        Egyptian fellow, Zaigon, comes on about 1967-68 and be is the first guy&#13;
&#13;
country.     Should you be doing progr .. lending, should       y~u   be doing          that I can hire.   At this time with the strongest support of the&#13;
&#13;
project lending?     They are interested in such things as the various                  President, and even though it is a Preaident-dominated institution. as&#13;
&#13;
gaps which exist in administrative ability, in manageaent, in the                       1 aaid before, yet in some way these people find it so difficult to&#13;
&#13;
staffing of a project.     They want to know what kind of secondary                     accept.&#13;
&#13;
benefits, what kind of social, economic benefits you may get from the                        Take another kind of question.    Take margins of preference. of&#13;
&#13;
project--benefits which are outside the simple financial coat-benefit                   which you are well aware.   What kind of margins do you give to a&#13;
&#13;
analysis.     I found this was just growing like Topsy in front of me sa                domestic supplier in a less developed country as against a foreign&#13;
&#13;
we were doing this, all these additional social and economic coats and                  exporter, a foreign supplier?    We had a simple rule of thumb of 15&#13;
&#13;
benefits, because the aoment we started to talk about a development                     percent.    From a banking point of view, absolutely sensible.     It had no&#13;
&#13;
attitude, the traditional cost-benefit analysis, which was suitable for                 logic, but it was internationally acceptable; it was a rule of thumb.&#13;
&#13;
the Bank, became. not wrong, but just inadequate.            You couldn't atop          Lmmediately when you get to an economic development or a social&#13;
&#13;
with that.     You just bad to go on to other things.         You got to the            development point of view, you get into the whole question.      But the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   47                                                                              48&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
moment you opened the Pandora'â&#128;¢ box that I opened by saying that it            that IDA bad been started as early as '59 and, I suppose. conceived&#13;
&#13;
ought to be a development finance agency, they begin to inaiat on an           earlier than that. and there bad been discussion of education projects&#13;
economic approach.                                                             well before 1964 1 as I recall, there must have been some thinking in&#13;
&#13;
      In the Bank we bad a aiaple rule.    We financed the foreign             the Bank even before '64 along the general lines that you are talking&#13;
&#13;
exchange coet of the project.     Then that meant that very saall              about.       So I am asking, How abrupt was this change?&#13;
&#13;
projects, or project&amp; with a low foreian exchange content like                 FRIEDMAN:        I completely accept the point that it was not abrupt.   I&#13;
&#13;
education, aot cut out.    Then we found that, from the point of view of       think the difference is--I think I dare to say--you have done a lot of&#13;
&#13;
strategy, wbat we wanted to do ia encourage education.       But you can't     work on the early history of the Bank--there probably is no idea today&#13;
&#13;
make a big loan in the field of education in termâ&#128;¢ of foreign exchange.        that isn't to be found in the mind of someone that you read about in&#13;
&#13;
And ao painfully, very painfully--it ia still going on in the Bank--it         1945.        It is juat a question of what you emphasize.   Back when Woods&#13;
&#13;
begins to puah the Bank, to aay, well, maybe one way of doing tbia i1          sot this idea that he wanted to transform the Bank. he wasn't creating&#13;
&#13;
that we don't really have to confine ouraelvea to foreign exchange.            anythina      ~~.he        was just taking certain minor trends in the Bank&#13;
&#13;
koow the Article&amp; aucb better than I do.       You don't have to really        and .akin&amp; them major and recognizing that if he made them major it was&#13;
&#13;
confine yourself just to the foreian-ezchange clause.       It vas this kind   going to be at the expense of other things in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
of thin&amp; which led, as I mentioned before, to      suppl~ntary   finance.              He    told ae when I first came. ''Irving, if we can't have a big IDA,&#13;
&#13;
It led to our proposal that countries could effectively uae $3-4               I don't want an economics staff, because I don't think, as long as the&#13;
&#13;
billion a year of additional capital of which we thought that 50               Bank ia hisser than IDA, we'll ever transform the Group into a&#13;
&#13;
percent ouaht to be concessiooal, or about $1 - $2 billion; and out of         development agency.        The World Bank aa s bank. with ita concern about&#13;
&#13;
that, 1/2 ought to be aiven to IDA.     That ia bow we sot to the notion       repayaent of debt, its own creditworthiness, and so forth, is going to&#13;
&#13;
that the new IDA repleniabaent ouaht to be $1 billion a year.                  find it very difficult to do the kind of things that you and I have&#13;
&#13;
OLIVEJ.:    Hay I juat aak you a couple of questions for clarity?     You      just been talking about.&#13;
&#13;
have ao many ideas going nov, I want to aake sure that we are absorbing        OLIVER:        If there bad not been the creditworthiness investigations,&#13;
&#13;
them all as we go.     I have two questions.    To play the Devil's            nobody would bave been that sure that coocessional loans were really&#13;
&#13;
advocate~    I am wondering whether this change was as abrupt as you are       necesaary to supplement the 7-8 percent loans.&#13;
&#13;
making it sound, the date being something like 1964.       Given the fact      FRIEDMAN:       Absolutely.   That is what I said before:   maybe this whole&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 49                                                                           50&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
idea came from Eugene Black, or some other people that were in the Bank      but when it is all added together you get a very different kind of&#13;
&#13;
long before I.    Vbat I am saying is that Woods recognized that if you      institution, much more complicated.     And it is so gradual, Bob; you&#13;
&#13;
wanted to build up conceaaional loans, it vas going to be at the             are ao right about it, it still goes on.     Many of these things are&#13;
&#13;
relative importance of the World Bank loans and World Bank activities,       still very turbulent.     Issues within the Bank in which the future&#13;
&#13;
and that things like    eco~ic   work would grow in iaportance relative to   course of Bank activities in this field are still very much under&#13;
&#13;
loan work.     That didn't .ean that the Bank didn't do any econaaic work    evolution.&#13;
&#13;
before.     There waa nothing totally lacking in the Bank that 1 found,      OLIVE&amp;:     Can we then come back to where you were?   Could you&#13;
&#13;
including concern for population.                                            explain in more detail bow you arrived at this number for the&#13;
&#13;
     Woods bad been intereated in population long before he came to          Second IDA Replenishment. I think you said $1-$2 billion was the&#13;
&#13;
the Bank, and I dare say Eugene Black bad been interested in                 goal, per year.&#13;
&#13;
population--or urbanization.     They bad rationalized education by          FRIEDMAN:     I found when I got to the Bank that one of the things&#13;
&#13;
building some medical facilitiea in the Pbilippinea before I caae            that was really hampering the whole development assistance effort&#13;
&#13;
there.    But all of this was regarded as very exceptional.      The core    was a great controversy on that how much more development assistance&#13;
&#13;
work of the Bank waa atilt public utilitiea, roads, power                    or capital was needed by the developing countries.      There were all&#13;
&#13;
generation, agriculture to acme extent, and the beginning of some            aorta of figures.     The OECD had a figure, the traders had a figure,&#13;
&#13;
induatry.     Tbe broad notion of a Development Finance Corporation          the UN bad a figure, and, if I remember correctly, they varied&#13;
&#13;
being financed directly by the World Bank with the DFC being the             anywhere from 0 to about $10 billion or more per year.&#13;
&#13;
intermediation between the Bank and the country aa a meana of being               I hit upon a new approach, because I was impressed as soon as I&#13;
&#13;
able to pour more in capital more rapidly and also to have more              came to the Bank with how much knowledge there was inside the Bank&#13;
&#13;
U.pact on the management of the whole industrial structure comes not         about countries.     They really knew a great deal about countries,&#13;
&#13;
as a new idea, but it flourishes at this time.        In the same way,       even though they had not gotten it through systematic country&#13;
&#13;
they already had consortia before this and aome consultant groups,           surveys.     Even loan officers, many of whom were economists in their&#13;
&#13;
but now instead of regarding the consultant group as the exceptional         professional training, knew a lot about their countries.      So 1&#13;
&#13;
thing, the consultant group tend5 to become the normal thing that            decided, from my experience in the Fund and the Bank, to begin to&#13;
&#13;
you aim for for any important country.     It is a shift in emphasis,        draw on my two reservoirs of knowledge.     We could ask the simple&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 51                                                                           52&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                            have   ~een   a lot of things that might have been beyond the scope of&#13;
question, How much more capital could countries effectively uaet&#13;
                                                                            experience of either the Bank or the Pund people), that we got to a&#13;
Not by having some kind of gueaevork as to what capital-output&#13;
ratios were or what their t.port elaaticitiea were, all of which            figure of $3-4 billion a year more--this is 1965--wbich could be&#13;
                                                                            used    It became the standard figure in all economics after that, and&#13;
were highly problematical and were really iD disrepute by this time&#13;
because the US AID progr. . bad tried to use them and gotten into a         almost every figure Iince then baa been a rectification for price&#13;
&#13;
lot of trouble in trying to    fo~late   the need for developaeot           changes or for increa1ed abâ&#128;¢orptive capacity.      Using that figure,&#13;
&#13;
assistance on the baa is of this kind of uniform model a.                   and, applying the need for concessional aid, we came out with the&#13;
&#13;
     I developed, with the help of aome of my staff people, like            figure and applying the need for conceasional aid, we came out with&#13;
&#13;
lavi Gulhati--be'a Indian--and Bob DeVries, a rather aiaple model           the figure that, out of that $3-4 billion, about $2 billion ought to&#13;
&#13;
for every country by asking the question, What new inveat.enta could        be given to concessional countries, including     all-important India&#13;
&#13;
                                                                            and Pakistan, in the total less developed world.       At this point they&#13;
be made which are in aiaht but are not setting made because of a&#13;
                                                                            were accounting for about 64--well, over 50, closer to 60 percent or&#13;
lack of foreign ezchange?    This was tested by going to each loan&#13;
                                                                            more than that--of total foreign assistance.      So at this point of&#13;
officer and asking   h~   to list from experience what investment&#13;
                                                                            time we got to the figure of $2     billio~&#13;
projects be personally knew of that were being held backÂ· which in&#13;
                                                                                     I suggested to Woods, that, purely as a practical matter of&#13;
his opinion were worthy of being financed and yet were not being&#13;
                                                                            negotiation, we go for half the amount; it didn't look like we were&#13;
financed becauae of lack of foreign exchange.     I then took my answer&#13;
                                                                            saying that the total job of conceaaional assistance should be done&#13;
to the corresponding guy in the Pund, the desk officer, to find out&#13;
                                                                            just by the World Bank Group.     You would say, we are prepared&#13;
whether be thought that vas a sensible judgment.&#13;
                                                                            administratively, and this was checked out with our administrative&#13;
OLIVER:     Did you alao ask the question of what projects would be&#13;
                                                                            people, that we have the capacity within the institution to handle a&#13;
worth doing at 8 percent as distinct from 2 percent?&#13;
                                                                            billion more dollars worth of lending of the kind that we were&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     Then the second question was, Which of these countries&#13;
                                                                            doing, leaving a billion dollars to others, whether it was the&#13;
are in the position to take on debt on existing Bank terma, and&#13;
                                                                            â&#128;¢ulti-regional banks, like the Inter-American Development Bank, or&#13;
which of these countries would need debt on much softer terms?        The&#13;
                                                                            other institutions, or national programs.     And that is how we got&#13;
answer we came out with was that in the sense of additional&#13;
                                                                            the figure of a billion dollars regarding replenishment.&#13;
effective use, which was a   min~al   concept (obviously there might&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                          53                                                                                   54&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Woods had never felt--be was very clear in saying this to me at                              OLIVER:     What is the year you are talking about here?&#13;
&#13;
the beginning--we never expected to get the billion dollars, but what                             fRIEDMAN:     1965-66.   Of course it takes years to replenish, but the&#13;
&#13;
we tried to do waa to make it clear to the world that to go from $250                             intellectual debate is '65-"'66.    It is in 1967 that you get the&#13;
&#13;

from the Europeans who refused to go along with this increased amount.                            (I forget the exact date of this. Bob; it may be 1966) I would guess,&#13;

The French and the Germans, but particularly the French, were molt                                within six months in 1966).     Willard said to George, I will come out in&#13;

concessional aid could be given in other ways like commodity                                      IDA.   But Woods turned him down.    Woods said,        1 want you to remember,&#13;

agreements, higher prices for raw materials, and bilateral assistance,                            Willard, that our $1 billion figure is not the total need.           You and I,&#13;

&#13;
OLIVER:      One last question about that bench aark.                        Aa I understand it,           growth rate, but what we got was that the range of growth rates were on&#13;
&#13;
this vaa arrived at by aiaply asking the question. What useful.                                            both sides of the UN Development decade.     In other words we found with&#13;

&#13;
available?       Was the additional question asked, What kind of rate of                                   with some countries you are talking as much as IS percent.     I don't&#13;
&#13;
growth ia necessary, rate of growth in real gross national product?                                        think we weighted it by population or national income, but we did find&#13;
&#13;
and was the answer to that question also related to these projects that                                    that it bad proven to be desirable not to get locked in with one&#13;

&#13;
FRIEDMAN:       That is right.       That is what I meant by the simple model--1                           corrected the gap we got from the growth rate. the feasible growth rate&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                          57                                                                                 58&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
baaed on feasible projects.       Let's say you got a gap of a billion             but to this day I have kept that table secret, and to this day people&#13;
dollars a year. more like the Indian figures--but actually you couldn't            complain about the study on the grounds that it      waan~t    well done simply&#13;
&#13;
see project&amp; for more than about $600 million, then our answer was,                because we hadn't been prepared to make it public.        I    wasn~     prepared&#13;

''Well, maybe tbia growth rate aiaply iln"t feuible, becauae we can't              to take the responsibility.     I wouldn't let anybody.       When they tried&#13;

cutting back the expected growth rate becauae you don't have enough                interested in was not academic scoring, if you don't mind my saying so.&#13;
&#13;
ab1orptive   capacit~    That eontroveray is still going       o~   This ia what   We were interested in getting more money for IDA.      We did know that we&#13;
&#13;
I would resard aa the developaent agency approach, but we didn't do                a1ked for leal than what vas needed and could be used.           It was going to&#13;
&#13;
thia kind of weighted averase atuff.                                               be mishty tough to get even a substantial increase in IDA because we&#13;
&#13;
     Incidentally, we were very eabarraased at the time becauae I vaa              were starting from the point that most countries assumed that the IDA&#13;
&#13;
personally blaated by the Development Aaaiatance Coaaittee which asked             replenishment would be abort lived.&#13;
&#13;
in a private coaaunications why we didn't publiah the study?           I didn't            There was a very interesting question--may 1 digress a moment&#13;
&#13;
publiab the study becauae it vas the firat atudy that bad ever beeo                here?     I don't know whether this baa been noted before--I       don~t    think&#13;
&#13;
doue couotry by country.     The only way I could prove the validity of            it baa been noted in anything that baa been published.          The question&#13;
&#13;
the study was to liat every country -- because we did it for every                 arose, should George Woods be the one who tried to get the money for&#13;
&#13;
country -- and give the figure that we bad of what it needed to do in              IDA?     In the previous experience, it bad been the American Secretary of&#13;
&#13;
the way of project financing.       I thought that would be political              the Treaaury who had done it, people like Douglas Dillon who had really&#13;
&#13;
dynamite -- a Part One country would be furious at the idea that we                ne&amp;otiated the increase in IDA as the principal contributor.              Black had&#13;
&#13;
would put out a fisure for Ceylon that vas three times aa high as they             played a relatively minor role on the financial side.           He obviously&#13;
&#13;
were financing.     We put out some figures for some countries in Africa           must have played an important role in advocacy, but he          didn~t    take the&#13;
&#13;
that were five time a a a high.    Therefore. we could say how we did it.          responsibility of putting it together.     Secretary-of-Treasury Fowler&#13;

&#13;
really resulted in the furor on the IDA     replenis~ent   was that we never      resentment of being pinned up against the wall is still very fresh in&#13;

on these meetings at our Governora' Conference in 1965 or '66; it was             why Woods waa waiting for the Americana was because the Europeans had&#13;

thia point an issue arose which ia still an     ieâ&#128;¢u~    It came up, oddly         OLIVER:     In your recollection did consideration of tied-loans or grants&#13;

about a apecial fund of American money ezcept as tied        ai~                   FRIEDMAN:     I have a feeling that some other governments sounded us out.&#13;

     Wooda at this time, I think with the complete support of everybody            Perhapa the Swedes, at one time. had sounded us out on that.       I don't&#13;

don't want any tied aid which we only adainiater.       Thia bad been a            weren't many aid programs.    There waa the French program which was&#13;

&#13;
better to be a beacon light, much better being an ezample, even though             There ia the British program, which by this time was leveling off.&#13;

we have lesa aooey; our aoney should be well used, and we can't uae it             After 1965 they juat didn't increase any   mor~      We had a very tough&#13;

persuasive for every year but that one.         In any event, Woods decided           influenced by that position.   Since then I have given it a little more&#13;

that he would not give Bank money to IDA â&#128;¢â&#128;¢ long aa the U.           ~   vaa not      thought, and an event occurred to me that is worth bringing out    b~cause&#13;

and Dick Demuth, and they bad coae up with a new proposal on the                Did be realize what this was?       He said, ''No.   He waa told that in the&#13;
&#13;
balance-of-payment&amp; aspect of the Second IDA lepleniabment.        This was     end all the monies would be uaed.     11&#13;

completely like thunder or ligbtenin&amp; out of a blue sky for me.          I      fact they could only be used if you have tied aid," at which point he&#13;
&#13;
later found out that it bad been suggested by Bernhard Zagorin, who was         was terribly disturbed.     I don.. t think be ever forgave Dick Demuth that&#13;
&#13;
at this point the U. S. Executive Director in the Aeian Developaaent            incident, because he himself didn..t know about balance of payments, and&#13;

&#13;
considered knowledgeable about the International Monetary       Syate~          that George Woods had agreed with this two pools        approac~   The&#13;
&#13;
      Tbe proposal vas essentially along the linea that the D.      ~   would   Treasury also bought it, and Fowler vas very pleased because he said&#13;
&#13;
contribute ita share of IDA, with a very minor reduction, but the               now be had the perfect approach to the Congress.        There was going to be&#13;
&#13;
monies would be set up in two pools (what I call the two pots                   no impact from the IDA replenishment.         We had been caking the case that&#13;
&#13;
approach).   IDA would be drawing from these two pools, but the                 there was no impact from the overall Bank approach, because we were&#13;
&#13;
mecbanica of it were such that if procurement of American goods did not         able to take the fact that the Bank was making a positive contribution&#13;
&#13;
lead to as high a percentage in IDA as the D. S. contributed, the               to the U.   ~   balance of payments and offset it against IDA one. but&#13;
&#13;
remaining funds would not be used.   Since U.   ~   procurement from IDA        that vasn..t as good a case as if you could make IDA itself non-&#13;
&#13;
vas between 20-25 percent at the moat, and ita contributions were about         balance of payments in its effect, because that would mean then that&#13;
&#13;
40 percent, this really meant a reduction in the D.     ~    contribution by    the World Bank Group ..s total impact would even be more positive.&#13;
&#13;
a significant, very large magnitude unless IDA could rig procurement.           Fowler and the people    ~bo ~ere   handling Congressional relations were&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    71                                                                                     72&#13;

&#13;
terribly pleaaed, and they immediately ran with the ball and started to                           and asking for any kind of money, even for something for IDA, which at that&#13;
talk to people about tbb new approach.                Some of it leaked to foreign                tiae was really quite popular in the Congress.       Nevertheless, it still was&#13;
countries, and our own etaff, for aoae rea1on, very quickly bad gone                              foreign aid, it still was development aaaistance, ao I think the general&#13;
overboard on it--I think becauae they hadn't analyzed it, they hadn't                             feeling that the delay in the IDA replenishment was costly in itself is&#13;
realized what they were doina-                                                                    probably right.     It probably was   coatl~   But it was due to this kind of&#13;
       Well, I spend the nezt, I think it amounted to about three montba 1                        thing.    At the meeting in Paris, when we first proposed the balance-of-&#13;
trying to undo thia.           Tbe firat reaction we got from people abroad, like                 payment&amp; solution, we just got all bell from the French delegation who also&#13;
the British and the French, vaa that we did not dare to have a aeeting on                         viciously attacked the D. S. on the grounds that this was a disguised way&#13;
&#13;
IDA repleniabaent if we were to go up with thia propoaaL                      It would be         of reducing by Dearly 50 percent the U. S. contribution.      They charged that&#13;
&#13;
regarded as abeer chicanery.           We worked out a modified propoaal which was                Aaerican officials in the World bank--Burke knapp and I were leading the&#13;
&#13;
that we'll uae the D. &amp; contribution and othera; to the ezteot to which                           Bank delegation--were just obviously playing the American game.&#13;
&#13;
the U.   ~   contribution waa unuaed, it would be uaed later than the other                       OLIVER:     Would you care to comment about the moat recent IDA replenishment&#13;

..f1mdi .llAd ..U.U.   ~       The French, having known about         th~    original propoaal,   FRIEDMAN:     I'll be glad to comment on it, Bob, but I think you ought to&#13;
&#13;
aaid that tbia waa a fake:           you have no intention of uaing the laat                      keep in mind that in the Second IDA Replenishment I was deeply involved; I&#13;
&#13;
portion.     We know that when you get to the laat portion, we'll be told that                    waa also involved considerably in the earlier stages of the Third IDA&#13;
&#13;
that is a burden on the U. S. balance of payaenta, and, in aome way or                            Replenishment, but very little involved in this fourth replenishment.        So I&#13;
&#13;
another. the funda will be frozen.               I auapect that to tbia day the French            don~t    really regard myself as anything except an observer with a good seat&#13;
&#13;
remain auapicioua of thia propoaal because thia peculiar firat propoaal                           in the ballpark in the sense tbat where I sit is pretty close to where the&#13;
&#13;
would have done exactly what the French feared it would have done.                                gaâ&#128;¢e ia going on, and I know the players, and I have some idea what is&#13;
&#13;
       Thus, suspicion waa another element in the delay in the Second IDA                         going on.     Nevertheless. I am not one of the players in the fourth&#13;
&#13;
Replenishment which helps explain why it took ao long.                      The delay waa very    replenishment.     Do you think it is worth it--my comments on it?&#13;
&#13;
important, because all during this time the sentiment against foreign aid,                        OLIVER:     Well, maybe just   briefl~   Why do you think the Congress so&#13;
&#13;
as you know very well, Bob, waa running down bill.                  So that any delay by a        suddenly turned against IDA?&#13;
&#13;
year really meant that we were that much worse off in going to the Congress                       FRIEDMAN:     In the first place, I think the willingness to provide&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       13                                                                                   74&#13;

development aaaiatance in the country i1 going steadily down bilL         1 think   Director and the U. S. GoverDlllent.   The Treasury was scolded boi:h in&#13;
that IDA bad the misfortune of coaing acroaa the energy crisis; the Middle          hearings and in print for ita failure to follow closely enough.&#13;
Eastern War; a general apathy toward India -- a lot of it, hostilities the               There bad been ruckuses about Chile and lending to Chile, and some&#13;
fact that IDA is still regarded as larsely a financial mecbaniam for India          ruckus about Iran and lending to     Ira~   You had a lot of unfavorable&#13;
and Pakistan; that Pakistan is really not quite the favorite it was before          factors.    Finally, I think that one has to mention the fact that the Bank&#13;
the breakup between Pakiatan and Bangladesh, the end of the Viet Nam War.           baa pushed multilateral aid. baa really insisted on being the leader in&#13;
which baa reduced political concern about South Aaia; and the need to keep          world affaire on this, publicity viae aa well aa in fact, and baa&#13;
India and Pakiatan, and now Bangladesh, happy.      I think people are leas         emphasized The World knowing that it was the leader.         Thus, it baa also&#13;
concerned about foreign aid.    Maybe there is a shift toward military stuff        become the principal target.      Wherever you go in the world today, the Bank&#13;
as the military talks about naval ba1e1 in the Indian       Ocea~   I think all     is more viaiblei and what the Bank does is subject not only to more praise,&#13;
of these thinge have reduced Aaerican intereet in IDL                               but to aore hostile   criticia~     When you are trying to get IDA replenished,&#13;
&#13;
      I know froâ&#128;¢ aoae of the reporta coming back from the Hill that at the         people forget the favorable criticisms and remember the unfavorable&#13;
&#13;
particular tiae the IDA replenishment vas taken up, there was also                  criticisms.&#13;
&#13;
conaiderable hoatility toward the Arabs and to the really weird idea of the              I think it was very startling that for this IDA replenishment, at the&#13;
&#13;
Arab countries being leas developed countries.      If they are boetile to the      bearing that took place--the one where they handed in this negative vote,&#13;
&#13;
0.   ~.   why go around helping such people?   Clearly, aa a matter of fact,        at the preliainary bearing--Schultz, Volker, Hennessey, and the u. s.&#13;
&#13;
none of the IDA funds were going to be uaed for any oil exporting country.          Executive Director all vent down to the bearings. The administration&#13;
&#13;
They wouldn't be used for the Venezuelans.      (They probably would be used        mustered all their big guns, all the moat important ones, but not s single&#13;
&#13;
for   Indoneai~)   All of these things were in the atmoaphere when IDA was          Republican supported IDA even though all these leading Republicans came&#13;
&#13;
being repleniaheL      I think the other thing ia that there had been a             down to testify.    You bad a general indifference to the whole thin&amp;        No&#13;
&#13;
general accounting office report on the Bank which bad been quite critical          one could really believe that this Administration, under the existing&#13;
&#13;
of the procedures of the Bank, critical of the fact--and this bad been              political circumstances and everything else, really could attach much&#13;
&#13;
growing for years--that the U. S. does not have enough knowledge about bow          importance to the IDA replenishment.&#13;
&#13;
the World Bank grew, including IDA.     Who does its business?      There was a     OLIVER:    Ia there also a possible implication that the Bank itself had&#13;
&#13;
feeling that there baa been a lack of scrutiny by the U. S. Executive               not been as active behind the scenes, so to speak, in trying to line&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         75                                                                                76&#13;

&#13;
FRIEDMAN:    I think that the Bank baa aade a very critical error in             aoaeone behind the scenes who is tryina to butter up people and make&#13;
&#13;
tbia whole thing. I    aay   aay. in turning the thing over to Dennis            them friendly and so forth.   As far ae I know, McNamara       s~nds   very&#13;
&#13;
Rickett and then to Bill Iliff for      year~   They are both very able          little tiae in what aigbt be considered politicking.       In all fairness&#13;
&#13;
people, but they are Engliahaea.      Tbey don't carry veisbt with the           to hia, not much of this wae done by George Woods     eithe~     George Woods&#13;
&#13;
A.ericana, either aa individuals or aa a nationality.         I think that       left aoat of the IDA politicking to ae 1 which obviously I was in no&#13;
&#13;
tbia baa been recoanized in the Bank, though 1 have never beard it               position really to do.&#13;
&#13;
eaid   e~plicitly   because aa a aatter of fact thia fellow. Duke Herriaa.            We had great help from Joe Fowler.      Joe Fowler ia a born&#13;
&#13;
baa been carrying the ball aore and aore.       Be ia a very able guy.       I   politician who loves to butter up   peopl~    We had great help from Joe&#13;
&#13;
think that be ia one of tbe beat guye that they have ever had involved           Barr, who was the Undersecretary of the Treasury--Joseph Barr 1 who is&#13;
&#13;
in the IDA repleniahaent.      But he coaea in after a few years of the          now president of Aaerican Security, and who for a little wbile 1 when&#13;
&#13;
other suya, and he ia not continuity.       It ian't aa though be baa been       Fowler left the administration towards the end of the Johnson&#13;
&#13;
tbere playing a major role for five or aiK yeare and baa been able to            adminiatration, waa Secretary of the Treasury.      Joe Barr had been a&#13;
&#13;
build the contacta.     Be coaea in when the building ia 3/4 burned down,        former Congresaman from Ohio.    He just loves to mingle with&#13;
&#13;
and you aay, 1'Bow about reacuin&amp; the buildin&amp;'l 11   From what I can aee,       Congressmen.    Fowler and Barr were both genuinely devoted to getting&#13;
&#13;
be baa been working like a doa and probably quite effectively, but he            IDA repleniahed.    To this day they are very proud of the fact that they&#13;
&#13;
has been bailina out the boat when it ia 3/4 sunk, or at leaat ia full           got the Americana to accept the principle that IDA should go up to $1&#13;
&#13;
of water.    He baa a very touah job.                                            billion.   We wouldn't be talking the magnitudes today were it not for&#13;
&#13;
       The other thin&amp; ia McHaaara'a personality.     Be really ian't a          Joe Fowler.    So we bad in Joe Fowler in effect the kind of politicking&#13;
&#13;
very eocial 1 or aociable auy.     Be ia not the kind of guy that will           which you have to do in the Washington scene and which he loved to do.&#13;
&#13;
invite many people out to lunch or take them out on a boat ride or               I wasn't there.    I just heard what was going on, but he is just&#13;
&#13;
take them to hie bouse.      I think he ia probably very aood in a one-to-       marvelous with people.&#13;
&#13;
one couveraation, and he is very good in formal presentations where                   I don't think anybody else ran it this way.      I don"t think Schultz&#13;
&#13;
there ia an audience, but of courae by the time you get to the formal            is that kind of Washington politician.    Paul Volker is not that kind of&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                 Washington politician.    Jack Hennessey is a brand new boy on the scene.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         77                                                                           78&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So we've got nobody in the   Treaaur~   We have Congrelaional liaison       fact that I wasn't in the previous administration.      But I think that&#13;
people, and they have been working on behalf of InL      Thia               under the Woods administration certain definite things were&#13;
Administration baa been helpful on that; they have not been hostile.        accomplished.&#13;
&#13;
But ve haven't had the kind of aaeter politician&amp; we had under    Jobnao~         One is that the Bank did make a major turn from being a bank to a&#13;
&#13;
Furtberaore, by the way, Joe Fowler waa a leading Democrat talking to       development finance    agenc~   Secondly, I think there was a recognition&#13;
&#13;
Democrat&amp;, and now you have aany leadiog lepublicana who are opposed--      that IDA could not be a minorÂ· thing:    it had to be a major thing.&#13;
&#13;
at leaat a    aajorit~   It i1 intereâ&#128;¢tiog that, in the laat vote on IDA,   Woods was never successful in making it as important as be wanted it to&#13;
&#13;
there wasn't a aingle peraon who did not belons to the eo-called            be.   In his talks with me when I first came, which were interesting&#13;
&#13;
liberal wing of the Deaocrat party who voted for it.     Everybody else,    because they ahowed his viaion of the thing, we talked about bow big&#13;
all the conaervative and middle-of-the-road Deaocrata, voted against        the total lending program of the World Bank Group ahould be -- this is&#13;
it, aa well aa the &amp;epublicana.    Joe Fowler waa a aoutbern Deaocrat       in 1964 and in '64 dollars.     Double the figures now if you want to get&#13;
&#13;
vbo, althouab be waa known to be acceptable to the liberal Democrats,       the eaae pattern of impact.     His attitude was that he hoped that IDA&#13;
&#13;
could apeak to the Stenuiaea and the Eaatlanda and people like tbat.        would aet to be about one and a half billion dollars and that the World&#13;
&#13;
Be ia a Virginia Democrat.     It was so useful to have a person like him   Bank would be about one billion a year.     That is what he was trying to&#13;
&#13;
in office at the tiae, whereas I don't think a peraon like Schulz           accompli&amp;~      In this way the Bank would continue to play an important&#13;
&#13;
swinas the same kind of personal wei&amp;ht with these    peopl~                role, but the bigcer role would be played by InL       Well, as you know,&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Would thia be a good tiae to ask for your overall sumaary of    we have never got to thie proportionality--the World Bank bas remained&#13;
&#13;
the Woods administration and to some estent contrasts that you might        more important.     Nevertheless. the principle got established with some&#13;
&#13;
want to note between that adainiatration and the more recent period in      governmente and the U. S. administration.    The Canadians and the&#13;
&#13;
the Bank?                                                                   British accept the idea that IDA really ought to be' more important in&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     It is bard to be methodical in thinking out loud about the    the totality of the Bank Group than it is.     If it   ian~.   it is because&#13;
&#13;
Woods adminiatration.     Perhapa I should say at the beginning that        of the practical difficulties of getting approval from governments for&#13;
&#13;
having come into the Woods administration, I may have this tendency to      an increase in IDA, not because this is a wrong concept to start       wit~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
feel that what we did was new, when as a matter of fact maybe it wasn't           I think under Woods, too, there was the building of the staff of&#13;

He keeps on telling people this is really the great accomplishment of              play a more active role in supporting the foreign trade objectives of&#13;
&#13;
his administration.     There was the expansion of our project work into           developing countries, whether through commodity agreements or by openly&#13;
&#13;
nev areas.    We opened up our work on population, for example, at this            supporting the case for preferential entry to markets.         He, himself,&#13;
&#13;
time.    We began to aove further into education, although I think that            made speeches on this subject.      Again. maybe Black did too. but at&#13;
&#13;
had already begun.    We ended this notion   ( 11Ve 11 meaning Mr. Woods           least 1 was very aware that Woods in talking about this would always&#13;
&#13;
really and hia people, because I wasn't much involved in this) that the            emphasize that we shouldn't confine ourselves simply to financing or&#13;
&#13;
Bank should not lend to government- owned industrial banks aa well as              even to capital investments.&#13;
&#13;
only private indu1trial development banks.     (This bad been a source of               Be built the Projects Departaent 1 because be was really sold on&#13;
&#13;
great complaint by the developing countries.)     We greatly expanded our          the idea of technical assistance and technology transfer as being very&#13;
&#13;
work in Africa.    We undertook a lot of preliminary work for expanded             useful.     He tried to encourage more private capital going into&#13;
&#13;
programs like opening up offices in East Africa (in which ve took over             countries.    He bad a lot to do with interesting the various major&#13;
&#13;
aany of the expatrioa who were being moved out of East Africa--mostly              petro-chemical industries of the world to be willing to put more money&#13;
&#13;
Scandinavian agronomiata--I think largely at the prodding of Barbara               into India, if the Indiana were willing to have it.      He bad a lot to do&#13;
&#13;
Ward.     At this time Barbara Ward vas a great influence in the World             with mediating behind the scenes the copper situation in Chile before&#13;
&#13;
Bank, becauae abe is a good friend of George Woods, and be thinks abe              it broke    looa~    In fact be got an agreement that worked for about five&#13;
&#13;
ia marvelous.)     So you get this kind of very liberal ferment, this sort         years on the copper situation because of his personal relations with&#13;
&#13;
of advance thinking in the development field.                                      people like Anaconda Copper in     Canad~   He did a lot of things of that&#13;
&#13;
        It was Woods who initiated what became the Pearson Report.         (He     kind, by the way, that you may not even find a memorandum in the Bank&#13;
&#13;
started with Oliver Franks, he spent a year trying to nail down Oliver             about, because be waa never the kind Qf guy that made a memorandum on&#13;
&#13;
Franks unsuccessfully, and then he turned to Pearson to do it.)            Woods   anything.     I just happened to be personally present often enough to see&#13;
&#13;
had the feeling that there ought to be a reevaluation of development,              this going    o~    He would get on the phone with people that be knew and,&#13;
&#13;
that be ought to try to rescue it from going continuously down bill.               on a sort of '"old boy"" basis, make suggestions:    "'h, by the way, why&#13;
&#13;
        Woods gave a new emphasis to the importance of the Bank in the             the hell do you want to get into all this trouble?      Why don't you just&#13;
&#13;
commodity field, to the feeling that the Bank ought to be willing to               tell these guys you will take 49 percent interest instead of your 98&#13;

     I think the great tragedy of bia aG.iniatration waa the lack of            never bad more than 80 professional people.            He just didn't understand&#13;
&#13;
loyalty of bia ataff.        It broke hia heart in the end.    I have never     why there were all these people around him in the Bank.              He made it&#13;
&#13;
witnessed in all â&#128;¢Y career a more di1loyal ataff than the ataff of              clear:     he bad never bad any experience in organizing thousands of&#13;
&#13;
people who would literally leak to the preaa within a half hour or an           people and putting them to work, and so be was quite happy to delegate&#13;
&#13;
bour after they had beard Wooda aay aoaetbing.        Be would read about it    administrative authority.&#13;
&#13;
the next day in the newapapera.        It vaa something that I have never                He experimented with one administrator after another; nobody&#13;
&#13;
understood.     I have never understood why.     I didn't aake it my business   lasted for aore than six aonths to a year as his principal&#13;
&#13;
to probe into it, but it waa juat something--having come myself from a          adainistrator.      He would even do things like putting the General&#13;
&#13;
long national and international service--! have never seen a ataff              Counsel in charge of administration for awhile, because anybody who&#13;
&#13;
which leaked, and in a way hostile to the person for whom they worked.          wanted to be in charge of administration could have it as far as he was&#13;
&#13;
     My only theory is that he bad made clear in advance that be was            concerned.    He   usually gave it to people who wanted it and could claim&#13;
&#13;
not going to seek reelection, and, therefore. that as his term of               a long association with the Bank.            He did have a great regard about&#13;
&#13;
office began to coae to an end, the dominating posture of fear of the           having been in the Bank a long time.            He had a great regard for&#13;
&#13;
President became a much weaker thing.        People assumed that he was         experience.      When I came to the Bank and needed a principal deputy in&#13;
&#13;
becoming aore and aore of a lame duck President.        I could tell you some   my work, for example. his advice to me was very strongly that I find a&#13;
&#13;
very dramatic stories about Brazil, our Governors' Conference in                deputy from within the Bank.            He said, ""You may be able to find more&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I think very highly of Andy      ~amarck,   my deputy, but Wood1 thought that      Woods said, ''Sure, we have a lot of holidays over here."      Ten minutes&#13;
he was an excellent choice becau1e be bed been there ao long and bad               later, it must have been no more than ten minutes later, Woods' wife&#13;
done well in the Bank.                                                             called and said, 1 just heard from Margaret {McNamara's wife).       Bob baa&#13;
OLIVER:     Did Woods have a band in cbooain&amp; hia own auccealor?                   just called her to say, 'Margaret, l'a going to a place were they have&#13;
PRIEDKAH:     I don't know.    I know that be thinkâ&#128;¢ ao.    I think that be        a holiday on Washington's birthday!.,.&#13;
&#13;
thinks be had a great deal to do with cbooaing McNamara aa a aucceaaor.                    It always aeemed to me that the most attractive feature about the&#13;
&#13;
I know that be waa very plea1ed with tbe choice of KcHaaara, unleaa be             World Bank to McNamara vas that he was going to go to a place that bad&#13;
&#13;
waa ju1t diaiaulating.        In bia talks with ae, be aaid he waa very            a holiday.     It seemed be hadn't had a holiday on Washington's Birthday&#13;
&#13;
pleased with the choice of Mclf. . ara.      A1 be put it once, "Irv, when I       for eight years, if not more.     This atruck him as a really outstanding&#13;
&#13;
firâ&#128;¢t caae, I thought tbi1 vaa a country club.         Maybe I changed it a        fact about the World BanL      It worried Woods a bit, because I think&#13;
&#13;
little.     But, Bob will really put tbeae auya to vorL"          I think be waa   Wooda hoped McNamara might abolish holidays instead of taking advantage&#13;
&#13;
very iapreâ&#128;¢aed that McNaaara bad a reputation for bard word and making             of tbelh     1 think this ia a rather nice story in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
other people work harL        So be vaa terribly pleased                           peraonalitiea of the two people.&#13;
&#13;
     I have a lovely little anecdote about it which I think ia worth                       Woods vas very pleased with McNamara.   I think be had liked the&#13;
&#13;
recording in teras of thia transition between McNaaara and Woods.             I    apeecb that McNamara had â&#128;¢ade in Canada on development.       He showed it&#13;
&#13;
vaa having lunch with Woods one day, and Mclaaara calleL (Woods never,             to me, and be clearly felt that McNamara would be a good administrator,&#13;
&#13;
by the way, lunched with aore than one peraon if he could avoid it; the            that be was vigorous.    I think part of the link was that Barbara Ward&#13;
&#13;
anteroom vas too big.)        The phone rang.   He picked it up and eaid, ''Ob,    waa a common friend of both; much of what Barbara thought came out&#13;
&#13;
bello, Bob. 11 Be bad told â&#128;¢e by thia time that it vas McNamara, whom, by          through the mouths of McNamara or George Woods or both.       He would carry&#13;
&#13;
the way, at tbia point, 1 had never aet.         He said, ''Ob, you want to        on the Development Agency ideas against the BanL       Woods never talked&#13;
&#13;
talk about these thingat       Sure, why don't we talk about them Monday?''        about the Viet Ham War aspect of it--be never commented about whether&#13;
&#13;
McNamara must have aaid something equivalent to, "Well, why don't ve               this would be a handicap or not.    Woods was convinced that McNamara was&#13;
&#13;
talk about it tomorrow?" And Woods aaid, ''Tomorrow?         Tomorrow is           quite sincere in his devotion to development, that he would really&#13;
&#13;
Washington's Birthday. We're closed tomorrow.â&#128;¢â&#128;¢        McNamara to Woods said,     throw all of his talents and energy into development work and into the&#13;
&#13;
"Closed!? You mean you close the Bank on Washington's Birthday?"            And    Bank.    To this day they see quite a bit of each other; they remain good&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        85                                                                               86&#13;

friends.                                                                    checked it out that the   .au .2f   ipcreau Jt1.1 ..lJ..uH: .!Win   ~   .1h!m&#13;
     One of the things that I have tended not to understand, however,       ~     McNamara.   Of courae 1 Woods started with a much lower base, but&#13;
&#13;
is why everything that McHaaara does really tends to deprecate Woods'       be vas very receptive to the great increase in the Bank on two grounds:&#13;
contribution to the Bank.   How and then he will say nice things about      increasing project capability would enable the Bank to make more&#13;
Woods, but if you have read the docuaentation of the Bank, you know         productive loans (Woods was great on using the expression, "productive&#13;
that everything we do appears to start in 1968, that all comparisons        loans 11) ; the other was on economics staff. where he was very generous.&#13;
are between 1968, McNaaara"'a first year, and later.    In the first five   including allowing ae to set up the first Development Research Center&#13;
years of McHaaara, we did aore than in the previous twenty years put        supported by the Bank.     Where he held the Bank down, I think. was&#13;
&#13;
together and atuff like that.   I don't know whether that ia accidental     largely on loan officers.     He felt he knew 1 personally, about loans.&#13;
&#13;
or not, but it bas tended to obscure the Woods years.    I â&#128;¢â&#128;¢ sure that     Be didn't really need that many loan officers.        But when it came to&#13;
&#13;
McNamara understands that for his first two years, 1968-70, even the        technical assistance or economics work be allowed a huge expansion in&#13;
&#13;
increaaed lending vas already in place.    You don't lend in the Bank       the atafÂ£   The expansion in the Bank since then baa still been largely&#13;
&#13;
ezcept with a tiae lag of 2 - 3 years.    So that the earlier numbers of    in the project field and into different areaa: you get into rural&#13;
&#13;
his own administration were due to the fact that Woods had been very        development or you get into more of this other kind of technology.&#13;
&#13;
eager to ezpand the Bank, ezcept that Woods, in ezpanding the Bank               There bas been an increase in the technical capability of the&#13;
&#13;
Group, bad hoped that aore of it would be financed by IDA.    Be vas        World Bank. but I think the remarkable thing about the McNamara&#13;
&#13;
ezpanding the capability, particularly in project work like agriculture     administration is bow little it changed.        It bas been highly&#13;
&#13;
and education, in the hope that tbia would end up by being very largely     publicized. but someone like yourself who knows the history of the&#13;
&#13;
IDA financed.   Moat of this capability ended up in projecta that were      Bank. would find that there isn't a     j~rky   movement in the history of&#13;
&#13;
Bank financed becauae IDA funda were inadequate, but the capability         the Bank when McNamara comes.       What you find is that there is an&#13;
&#13;
build-up, particularly in the Projects Departaent, was huge during the      accelerating curve which continues to accelerate.&#13;
&#13;
time of the Woods adminiatration.   If we looked at the numbers, I am            The real difference is in the technique of management.          The real&#13;
&#13;
sure that the Projects Department's numbers are at least two to three       difference is that McNamara is management oriented whereas Woods wasn't&#13;
&#13;
times as big after Woods' four years as they were at the beginning.         management oriented.      I don't know. maybe Black wasn't either. although&#13;
&#13;
     As for the staff buildup, I am willing to wager without having         I have always suspected that maybe Garner was.         Maybe be had a&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                            87                                                                               88&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
different philosophy of management, but be thought a lot about                     be greatly influence~     It was under Woods, for example, that we&#13;
management.       The difference with Mclfamara is that hi1 management             introduced the Pund people into the consultant groups and the&#13;
orientation enda up in a aanageaent of which be i1 the bead.        He is          cooaortia.   Now it is taken for granted, but it was something that&#13;
unprepared to delegate aanaaement ao aoaeone       ela~                            Woods and I di~     The Pund people did oot come to consultant groups&#13;
&#13;
         Black clearly made Garner the manager. Wooda, I aa afraid, had           before, and nov it ia taken for granted that they will come.&#13;
nobody aa the manager of the Bank, ezcept rather sporadically.           No one         I think that one of the reasons that relations with the Pund are&#13;
atayed long enouab to have real       autborit~   Vooda did not aake Burke        auch aore remote under McNamara--maybe the oil prices and financing&#13;
lnapp the aenior vice president, which would have eatabliahed a manager           difficulties will bring them together again--is becauae McNamara likes&#13;
for the Bank.      It vaa never clear to me whether be didn't want to or          to run the Bank without having to worry about whether the Fund agrees&#13;
whether the Board didn"t want him to. Wooda would aay the Board didn't            with hi~      The delegation of authority in the Bank is now really quite&#13;
want to, but I auapect that aaybe he didn't want to..      But when McNamara      different.    You delegate authority to implement thinga that are decided&#13;
comea there ia no problea:       no aatter whoa be made aenior vice               at the top, you don't juat delegate authority to let people go ahead to&#13;
&#13;
preaident, if anyone, McRaaara would still be the chief aaoager of the            the beat of their abilit~       I honestly believe that the job of a Vice&#13;
&#13;

aaoager, his own chief executive officer, the result of which is that             Departaent in the previous institution, although vice president is a&#13;
&#13;
there ia much leas delegated authority than under Wooda--1 don't know             better title and it enables the Bank to pay more. which is perhaps the&#13;
about Black--but under Woods, becauae nearly every iaportant decision             beat justification for it; it enables you to increase the remuneration&#13;
now ia made in Kcllaaara'a office -- not just by hiaaelf, it aay be at a          to people.    But it doesn't have the delegation of authority.&#13;

Econoaic Committee.       Relations with the Pund have becoae pretty remote.      prepared to do the work of a whole company of men, but it does make for&#13;
&#13;
Under Woods they had been very close.       Wooda was very friendly with          a different kind of atmosphere.     There baa been a great expansion of&#13;
&#13;
Pierre-Paul Sweitzer.       He   encouraged my efforts to bring institutions      the staff and a great empbasia on very formal administration. very&#13;
&#13;
together, because Woods knew that if you were closer to the Fund, that            formal structures.   There is a sort of homogeneous quality in the Bank&#13;
&#13;
made for leas control over the Bank, and vice versa, because you bad to           now with a great emphasis on the fact that everybody fills out the same&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                          89                                                                            90&#13;

&#13;
forma, everybody puts in leave slips, and everybody does this when they        Indian comes from abroad, he won't go to a meeting on the grounds that&#13;
&#13;
are told, literally.     The President of the Bank puts in a leave alip 1      he baa to meet the guy at the airport.     No American ever leaves a&#13;
&#13;
and everyone ia auppoaed to.    Under Wooda, tbia just wasn't ao.      A       meeting to meet a friend at an airporti his friend doesn't expect him&#13;
&#13;
person like Peter Cargill ran the A1ia Departaent very differently from        to be there, but the Indian feels that his friend expects him to be&#13;
&#13;
the way Jerry Alter ran the Western Beaiapbere Departaent, and that was        there at the airport. and he will make up the time in hard work..      It&#13;
&#13;
considered good because Jerry had to deal with Latin Americanâ&#128;¢ and bad         ian't that he ia not a hard worker, he just doesn't see why he      can't&#13;
&#13;
a different kind of problea than Peter dealt with.      Alao, they were two    do it that evening, why he has to be there from 9:00 to 5:30.     I think&#13;
&#13;
different   me~    Mike Lejeune would run his departaent differently from      the peraon who understood this better than anyone else was Gene Black.&#13;
&#13;
a person like Bill Gooct.an would run bia department.     But now this kind    Be understood this kind of variety.    Maybe this was true with Bob&#13;
&#13;
of individuality ia cooe, and I aa told the reason for it ia that we           Garner too, because he was really running the Bank during that    tim~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
have grown ao big that we can't have individuality.                            When I waa in the Fund, we didn't have any feeling that within the Bank&#13;
&#13;
        I suspect that, more iaportantly, McNamara aa a aanager juat baa       people weren't happy about this kind of thing.     In the Fund. of course,&#13;
&#13;
much more of a concept of aanageaent and of bow things ought to be             we always had this recognition of diversity, and I think they have it&#13;
&#13;
done.    It eucoapasaes everything that people do.   Ria ideaa are not         to thil day.&#13;
&#13;
broken down by the personalities of people or individual differences of             McNamara did another thing which Woods started, though McNamara&#13;
&#13;
regionL     There ia a lot of tension in the Bank on tbia account.      I      baa done it much more   forcefull~   McNamara baa pushed the idea that, as&#13;
&#13;
think it grows out of tbia lack of recognition of diveraity.      It ia        President of the Bank, he is the spokesman for the developing&#13;
&#13;
really very difficult to get a Latin American to attach the aame               countries.   Woods had more of the idea, which I think was a transition&#13;
&#13;
importance to coming to work at 9 o'clock aa it ia to a North     America~     from Black to HcHamara--Wooda was sort of in between--that he was the&#13;
&#13;
If you have a Dutchman on your ataff, be aay come to work at 6 o'clock         bridge between the developed and the developing countries.    He would&#13;
&#13;
in the morning, becauae that ia the way he baa been brought up.        He is   try to talk in a way that was persuasive to the developed countries.&#13;
&#13;
supposed to get up at dawn and go to work.      It isn't that North            That vas bow he was.    McNamara, I think, seems to be less concerned&#13;
&#13;
Americans represent the highest standard of bard work, they just               about whether what he says is persuasive to developed countries, but&#13;
&#13;
represent something different.                                                 rather whether it is reflective of what developing countries would want&#13;
&#13;
        To an Indian, it is perfectly reasonable that if some fellow           to say.   As a result he has got himself into a problem that neither&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                          91                                                                             92&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Black nor Wood1 bad.   Under Wooda, what you said as the President of         Graves who would be very sophisticated about what developed countries&#13;
the Bank, even in a general capacity (like when you were addressing           thought, because they bad been writing speeches for Black and others,&#13;
&#13;
ECOSOC or a Governora' Conference or DBCTAD or juat on the platform)          and they knew quite well the kind of reaction.       They would know that in&#13;
&#13;
the World Bank ahould be able to   ~pleaent   itaelf.   The President might   the World Bank, part of the loyalty of developed countries, including&#13;
be avant-garde, but not ao avant-garde that be couldn't bring his own         the D. S., comes from the fact that they aell capital equipment to the&#13;
&#13;
organization along.    McHaaara'a now in the poaition where be ie being       developing countries and they are not really interested in a Bank which&#13;
&#13;
criticized by the developing countriea, to whoa be ia coapletely              is going to end up with local currency financing, which ia not going to&#13;
&#13;
devoted--ablolutely. 1000 percent devoted--becauae he ia not fulfilling       end up in exports from developed countries.    Even though they accept&#13;
&#13;
what he hUDaelf baa said.    Vhen you come to do something in the World       the notion, enthusiastically or reluctantly, of untied aid, they still&#13;
&#13;
Bank Group, you have to bring along the developed countriea aa well.          want it to come out in exports of their kind of capital goods.       If you&#13;
&#13;
Therefore, if you just reflect the viewa of developing countries, not         toea that over and start talking about employment, that is a much less&#13;
&#13;
addressing the views in such a way as to be persuasive to developed           appealing thing to a developed country.    You try to write it in such a&#13;
&#13;
countries, you may loae tbe developed countries, which â&#128;¢eana that you         way that you say you want to increase employment opportunities.       With&#13;
&#13;
often cut back what you will aay and accoamodate yourself to what you         McNamara, bangol You band it home so clearly that it is clear when it&#13;
&#13;
think are the limitations, the confines of acceptability.      In other       is all said and done that you might not be using the money for capital&#13;
&#13;
words you don't aay, "Look, I don't care whether these guys are going         goods, you might be using it for spades and hoes, and petrochemicals.&#13;
&#13;
to be outraged by what I say about land refora or what I say about            You will be buying things, but it might not be the kind of things that&#13;
&#13;
incoae distribution or anything else, even employ.enti that is what I         you really thought the World Bank was going to finance.&#13;
&#13;
believe in. 11                                                                       This means that the bridge   fun~tion--thia    is my view of it,&#13;
&#13;
     McNa. . ra geta involved in the problem that moat of the investments     because that ia what you asked, my view of it--that the bridge function&#13;
&#13;
of the Bank are capital intensive.    So the goveroaent from Nigeria in       is greatly weakened.   I think one reason McNamara is having trouble&#13;
&#13;
the laat conference gives the Bank bell on the grounds that Mr.               raising money ia that it is not as vivid that the World Bank is a&#13;
&#13;
McNamara ia making all these fine apeecbea when everybody in the Bank         bridge between the developed world and the developing, in which the&#13;
&#13;
knows they do nothing about income distribution or employment.      When      real purpose of the bridge is for one-way traffic, enabling the flow of&#13;
&#13;
speeches were written for Woods, there would be people like Harold            money and technology from developed to developing countries.       There may&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                            93                                                                                     94&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
be a little bit of traffic coins the other way, but it is a one-way                   â&#128;¢igbt be an anti-welfare argument.     11&#13;
                                                                                                                                  You are just spoiling the&#13;
&#13;
traffic bridge, whereas now ..tllf apoke'Nn ~ .Jlu. ~ i.Jmortant ..t.,g               countries.     They really ought to have hard loans.     Why concessional&#13;
&#13;
McNâ&#128;¢mâ&#128;¢ra.     Be really baa become couvinced that these problems are very             loans?"     But that Bank wasn't incredible.     How these people are&#13;
&#13;
grave and that someone baa to apeak out, but .1Jac. preajdepc;y ..I..Q.h   ~   .l)a   worried, and my interpretation of it is that McNamara, the advocate,&#13;
&#13;
~~ ~~                    veâ&#128;¢kened, and tbia is one of the real                        and McNamara, the President, and McNamara, the manager of the Bank or&#13;
differences.                                                                          chairman of the Board--are all really very distinct functions.          The&#13;
        Three senior people   ~ntioned   to me in the laat 48 hours they              Chairman of the Board is a mediator; he is supposed to bring countries&#13;
wished they could get the Bank back to being a Bank instead of a                      along.    The Manager of the Bank is supposed to get the staff to work.&#13;
development agency.     These were three of the people who played a major             As spokesman for the Bank, if he makes himself also a spokesman for the&#13;
role with me in belpin&amp; to tranafora the Bank.       They feel a lack of              Third World, the President is weakening his mediating role.        So this&#13;
credibility that uaed to be one of the great aaaeta of the Bank.           All        problea baa been created â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
of tbeae people--all three--had worked under Black aa well as Woods,                  OLIVER:     He is losing soae credibility in the developed world.&#13;
&#13;
and they all bad felt that one of the great things about the Bank was                 FRIEDMAN:     That is right, and I think this is what is hurting the Bank&#13;
&#13;
ita credibility.     The Bank was a place that everybody in the World                 in the IDA replenishment.     Bob, this is pure judgment and your&#13;
&#13;
relied upon and, in aoae way, in Black'â&#128;¢ mind, this was because it was                judgement ia at least as good as mine on this, but I have a feeling&#13;
&#13;
a bank.     A bank was where you shook banda and that was good enough.                that if Bob McNamara were to call, say, Fullbright, or Wilbur Hilla or&#13;
&#13;
       The Bank baa now gotten to the point where it is being attacked as             Stennis, or Eastland and some of the real powers on the minority aide--&#13;
&#13;
being incredible.     This ia one thing the Bank had never been attacked              people like Percy or Goldwater, and were to say, "Look, as an American,&#13;
&#13;
for.    It bad been attacked for being too cautious, too conservative and             I say to you that I think that it is in the interest of the United&#13;
&#13;
that sort of thing, but not for being incredible.        How you have papers          States that we have IDA replenished 1 11 I don't think be would carry any&#13;
&#13;
like the Fjnancial ..Iiau of London coming out and saying, "These guys                weight.     I think that in their minds McNamara has become a very&#13;
&#13;
don't know what they are saying.      They are just talking, and you don't            vociferous, leas or more able, depending on whether they agree with him&#13;
&#13;
know whether they mean what they say," and ao forth.        That kind of              or not, spokesman for the developing countries.        They regard him as a&#13;
&#13;
voice used to be in something like Barron's.       Under Woods you would              special pleader.    Whereas George Woods, and I dare say Black before&#13;
&#13;
have some guy saying, ''There shouldn't be any coneeaaional aid. 11        There      him, never went so far as to be regarded by Americans as special&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              95                                                                              96&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
pleadera for intere1ta that were not in har.ony with what ultimately                        I think, personally, that Japan is much closer to Europe on this.&#13;
&#13;
would be in American interests.                                                     If they had their way, and if the Asians were to accept it, the Asian&#13;
&#13;
     In the end Black could disagree with Dulles about Aavan and be                 Development Bank and similar institutions would be their chosen&#13;
&#13;
overruled, but Black was as good an American as Dullea.            They just had    instrument rather than a truly global institution in which they can't&#13;
&#13;
two different pointa of view of how to handle the Egyptian situation.               hope to be a great influence.     Therefore, it ia critical (if I were&#13;
&#13;
or the Ruaaiana.    George Woods vaa juat aa good an Aaerican aa Senator            advising Bob McNamara on this sort of thing now, which I used to try to&#13;
&#13;
Eastland; and if George Wooda 1 either directly or through Joe Fowler.              do in the early years) for him never to lose his identity as an&#13;
&#13;
told Eastland that if you don't do 1omething for tbeae poorer                       American.&#13;
&#13;
countries. it ia going to be rough for the United States, this would be                    A wonderful thing that I have found from my own experience is that&#13;
&#13;
ao.etbing like Senator Percy saying tbia to Senator Tower1.                         you can maintain your identity as an American and not lose your&#13;
&#13;
     To me this ia critically haportant 1 becauae, I am still convinced,            credibility with the developing world.       They aren"t in conflict.      It&#13;
&#13;
Bob, that neither the Pund nor the BaDk can get anywhere in this world              does   ~an   that, when you apeak, you have to be sensitive to the kind of&#13;
&#13;
at this stage in history without the thorough going conviction on the               things that people in the developed world care about.       For years, I&#13;
&#13;
part of the United States that there ia sufficient identity of interest             have been trying to get McNamara to say something about inflation in&#13;
&#13;
between the multilateral approaches of the Fund and the Bank and the                his governors' speeches, because I know that if the President of the&#13;
&#13;
longer-run foreign policy objectives of the United States.            There is no   World Bank were to come out and say, "I am worried about inflation,"&#13;
&#13;
other major country that identifies this way.          In Western Europe. they      the Western Europeans would say,    Â·~ell,   now. we finally have a&#13;
&#13;
have no such feeling about identity of interest.          They feel, if             President of the World Bank who really understands some of our problems&#13;

there is a strong feeling along these linea in Canada. which is, after&#13;
