THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT&#13;
For policy makers trying to improve their economyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW&#13;
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory&#13;
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides&#13;
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business&#13;
                                                               Region: OECD high income&#13;

regulations applying to domestic small to medium-size          Income category: High income&#13;
businesses through their life cycle. Economies are ranked&#13;
from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 64,510,376&#13;
Doing Business presents results for 2 aggregate measures:&#13;
the distance to frontier score and the ease of doing           GNI per capita (US$): 42,690&#13;
business ranking. The ranking of economies is determined&#13;
by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 6&#13;
rounded to two decimals. An economyâ&#128;&#153;s distance to&#13;
frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 6*&#13;
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.&#13;
                                                               Change in rank: 0&#13;

absolute terms, while the ease of doing business ranking       and the changes in methodology. See the data notes&#13;
can show only how much the regulatory environment has          starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016&#13;

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on&#13;
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and&#13;
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,&#13;
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are&#13;
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the&#13;
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.&#13;

time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory&#13;
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific areaâ&#128;&#148;for example, insolvencyâ&#128;&#148;it&#13;
receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark. Similarly, an economy receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a&#13;
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on t he&#13;
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economyâ&#128;&#153;s name&#13;
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business&#13;

        Hire an Approved Inspector&#13;
&#13;
        BuildCo signs a contract with an Approved Inspector. Approved&#13;
        Inspectors (AI) are companies or individuals authorized under the&#13;
        Building Act 1984 to carry out building control work in England&#13;
        and Wales.&#13;
&#13;
        An Approved Inspector will:&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Advise BuildCo on how the building regulations apply to its&#13;
        work (to a degree)&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Check plans for compliance with building regulations&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Issue a planning certificate (if requested)&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Inspect the work as it progresses&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Issue a final completion certificate (if requested)&#13;
&#13;
        The building control process was extended under the Building&#13;
        Act 1984 to include AIs as well as Local Authorities. Currently,&#13;
        there are 91 AIs on CICAIR Limited's register covering England             1 day               GBP 2,964&#13;
   1&#13;
        and Wales, accounting for about 60% of all building control&#13;
        work. AIs are licensed by CICAIR Limited for every 5 years. A list&#13;
        of AIs is available from the Construction Industry Council&#13;
        website.&#13;
&#13;
        Local Authorities have statutory time limits of 6 to 8 weeks for&#13;
        approving plans while AIs do not have any time limits so may&#13;
        provide a faster turnaround. By hiring AIs it eliminates need for&#13;
        companies to deal with the Building Control Department at the&#13;
        Local Authority. However, the Local Authority is still responsible&#13;
        for the enforcement of the regulations. AIs usually operate&#13;
        nationally and bring consistency of interpretation of the Building&#13;
        Regulations.&#13;
        While the planning permission (consent) is being obtained from&#13;
        Planning Department in Local Authority, the AI sends an Initial&#13;
        Notice to the Building Control Departement of Local Authority to&#13;
        inform them that it will take responsbilty over the building&#13;
        control process. The Local Authority Building Control&#13;

      Departement has 5 days in which to reject the notice.&#13;
&#13;
      If the Initial Notice is not rejected within 5 days construction&#13;
      work may begin. AI, for BuildCo's case, would conduct&#13;
      approximately 8-9 inspections at various stages of construction&#13;
      on a risk assessment basis.&#13;
&#13;
      AIs are in competition with local authority building control and&#13;
      have no restrictions on how much they can charge. AI fees are&#13;
      usually lower than local authority building control who are&#13;
      covered by the Building (Local Authority Charges) Regulations&#13;
      2010 which requires local authorities to fix their charges by&#13;
      means of a scheme, full cost recovery and the fact that the user&#13;
      should pay for the actual service they receive. The cost for the&#13;
      services of AI is comprised of several elements and is mostly&#13;
      charged on a hourly rate. The below estimate is a sample of what&#13;
      an average cost breakdown by an AI looks like:&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Plan checking: (16 hours x GDP 60) = GBP 960.00&#13;

&#13;
      Obtain planning permission&#13;
&#13;
      BuildCo must obtain planning permission from the local planning&#13;
      authority. In London, the decision-maker is the relevant London&#13;
      borough where the site is located. There are 33 boroughs in&#13;
      Greater London.&#13;
&#13;
      The planning application must be accompanied by a plan of the&#13;
      site, drawings showing the proposed development, and any&#13;
      other information the local authority considers necessary. The&#13;
      local authority publishes a list with the information it considers&#13;
2     necessary on its website, so that applicants know what is               56 days       GBP 6,676&#13;
      required of them. The relevant legislative framework is the&#13;
      Development Management Procedure Order (2010). If BuildCo is&#13;
      submitting a paper application, it must also provide at least 3&#13;
      copies of the accompanying documents. Alternatively, BuildCo&#13;
      can apply online via the Planning Portal, which accepts electronic&#13;
      planning applications on behalf of all London boroughs, using a&#13;
      standard application form that was introduced across England in&#13;
      2008. If it applies electronically, no further copies are required. A&#13;
      fee is charged for the planning application, based on the amount&#13;
      of floor space that would be created by the scheme.&#13;
&amp;#12;Doing Business 2016                     United Kingdom                                                     30&#13;

                                                                              Time to&#13;

      The size of BuildCo's proposed development falls below the&#13;
      threshold for a â&#128;&#156;major applicationâ&#128;&#157;, which means that the time&#13;
      frame for a decision is 8 weeks rather than 13. During this period,&#13;
      the local planning authority will publicize the application in the&#13;
      surrounding area and consult a number of statutory consultees -&#13;
      - bodies with a specialist responsibility such as nature&#13;
      conservation, heritage protection, highways -- who may wish to&#13;
      comment on the acceptability of the proposal from their&#13;
      perspective. The local authority accepts these comments and the&#13;
      comments of any local people who wish to comment on the&#13;
      application. They will be taken into account in the decision to&#13;
      grant or refuse permission. If no decision is made within 8 weeks,&#13;
      or if the authority decides to refuse permission, the applicant is&#13;
      entitled to appeal to the Secretary of State.&#13;
&#13;
      Additionally, in April 2010, the Government introduced new&#13;
      'permitted development' rights for businesses who seek to&#13;
      extend their existing premises. This means that minor extensions,&#13;
      which would previously have required planning permission, may&#13;
      proceed without it, thereby saving time for the business owners&#13;
      and enabling the local planning authority staff to concentrate on&#13;
      larger and more important projects. In May 2013, the&#13;
      Government further extended these rights to allow for larger&#13;
      extensions of pre-existing agricultural buildings and warehouses.&#13;

      Approved Inspector files the initial notice to the Local&#13;
      Authority&#13;
&#13;
      Once the contract is signed and the terms of reference are&#13;
      outlined, the builder and the AI jointly notify the local authority&#13;
      of their intention to build -- also called an initial notice. This&#13;
      initial notice will inform the Local Council that the AI has been&#13;
      retained. Once this notice has been accepted by the local&#13;
      authority, the responsibility for plan checking and site inspection&#13;
      will be formally placed on the AI.&#13;
&#13;
3     The local council has 5 days to accept or reject the initial notice     5 days       no charge&#13;
      in writing (via email, fax or post). Acceptance is given by default&#13;
      if the local authority does not respond within the 5-day period.&#13;
      During that period of time, no work can be done.&#13;
&#13;
      Once construction work commences, the AI would conduct at&#13;
      least 8 -- 9 inspections at various stages of construction and risk-&#13;

      Safety Office to ensure that the building is compliant with the&#13;
      latest fire safety legislation and that the appropriate fire and life&#13;
      safety systems are in place. By law, the Fire Safety Office must&#13;
      respond within 15 business days (21 calendar days) and send its&#13;
      comments and approval. This is done as part of plan approval&#13;
      process and is recorded as an independent procedure since AI&#13;
      interacts with a Fire Officer.&#13;
&#13;
      Upon the completion of the building, BuildCo used to obtain a&#13;
      Fire Certificate from Fire Safety Office. However, the Fire&#13;
      Certificate is no longer required following the reforms in the&#13;
      Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (FSO 2005) which&#13;
      came into effect in October 2006, and replaced over 70 pieces of&#13;
      fire safety laws.&#13;
&#13;
      The FSO applies to all non-domestic premises in England and&#13;
      Wales, including the common parts of blocks of flats and houses&#13;
      in multiple occupations (HMOs). The FSO 2005 is a tool for self-&#13;
      regulation of businesses for the fire risk of the premises.&#13;
&#13;
      Under the FSO, the responsible person must carry out a fire&#13;
      safety risk assessment and implement and maintain a fire&#13;
      management plan. The companies have to carry out a risk&#13;
      assessment by completing a 5-step fire risk assessment survey&#13;
      online:&#13;
      (http://www.fire.gov.uk/Workplace+safety/WhatTheLawRequires/&#13;
      )&#13;
&#13;
      According to this survey -- FSO 2005 the warehouse of BuildCo&#13;
      would be classified as medium risk object. Since there will be&#13;
      more than 5 people occupying/working in the building, BuildCo&#13;
      would need to file the copy of completed FSO 2005 to the local&#13;
      Fire Safety Office. BuildCo does not need to wait for the approval&#13;
      or any other consent before using the premises. This risk is with&#13;
      the building operators, as they are deemed liable for any&#13;
      problems.&#13;
&#13;
      The Fire Safety Office may conduct an inspection under a risk-&#13;
      based scheme: whether there was a similar track record of&#13;
      companies with fire, or neighbors complain, etc. Small scale and&#13;
      standard objects would be seldom inspected. Also, given that&#13;
      this would be a new building it would be assumed by the Fire&#13;
      Safety Office that the latest techniques of fire safety prevention&#13;
      would have been considered during the planning process.&#13;

&#13;
      Following the nationwide implementation of the "Energy&#13;
      Performance of Buildings Directive" adopted, on December 16,&#13;
      2002, as of October 1, 2008 all commercial buildings whenever&#13;
      built, rented or sold require an Energy Performance Certificate.&#13;
      The certificate records how energy effcient a property is as a&#13;
      building and provides A+ to G ratings. It is the responsibilty of&#13;
      the builder/constructor to give the Energy Performance&#13;
      Certificate to the Purchaser on physical completion of the&#13;
      building and notify the local authority Building Control officers&#13;
      or approved inspectors, who will not issue a Certificate of&#13;
      Completion until the issue of an EPC has occurred.&#13;

      They are produced using standard methods and assumptions&#13;
      about energy usage so that the energy effciency of one building&#13;
      can easily be compared with another building of the same type.&#13;
      This allows prospective buyers, tenants, owners, occupiers and&#13;
      purchases to see information on the energy effciency and carbon&#13;
      emissions from their building so they can consider energy&#13;
      effciency and fuel costs as part of their investment.&#13;
&#13;
      An EPC always includes a recommendation report that lists cost&#13;
      effective and other measures (such as low and zero carbon&#13;
      generating systems) to improve the energy rating. A rating is&#13;
      also given showing what could be achieved if all the&#13;
      recommendations were implemented.&#13;
&#13;
      The fee for producing an EPC is determined by the market and&#13;

        The application can be submitted online, in person or by mail. The&#13;
        connection requestor has to attach with the application: completed&#13;
        application form and site drawings.&#13;
&#13;
        At this stage the applicant can choose either UK Power Networks or an&#13;
        Independent Connection Provider to design the network extension while&#13;
        only UK Power Networks can design the point of connection and any&#13;
        upstream reinforcement works.&#13;

        The connection may also be provided by an Independent Distribution&#13;
        Network Operator (IDNO). With this option the IDNO would continue to&#13;
        own and operate the distribution system assets installed. The majority of&#13;
        the clients customers choose UK Power Networks to complete all parts&#13;
        of the connection for this type of project.&#13;
&#13;
        Since September 2008 UK Power Networks has not required assessment&#13;
        and design charges to be paid in advance of quotation and these costs&#13;
        are now included in the quotation such that the customer will pay only if&#13;
        the quotation is accepted. This follows a consultation by the GB energy&#13;

      connection customers choose UK Power Networks to carry out all the&#13;
      external connection works. Given the case assumptions the most&#13;
      common arrangement would be the installation of a 200 amp TP &amp; N&#13;

      UK Power Networks issues a supply number (Metering Point&#13;
      Administration Number or MPAN) after the connection offer has been&#13;
      accepted by the customer (normally within 1 calendar day). UK Power&#13;
      Networks will issue a MPAN to the customer before the connection&#13;
      works are completed. The customer will pass the MPAN to its chosen           7 calendar days         GBP 0&#13;
3&#13;
      electricity supplier. The supplier must register the MPAN with UK Power&#13;
      Networks.&#13;
      The supplier will co-ordinate metering, energisation and application of&#13;
      energy rates. The supply contract start date is aligned with connection&#13;
      energized date. The supplier will need to receive an estimate, or could&#13;
      work with the applicant to develop a load profile to be able to provide a&#13;
      supply contract.&#13;

        UK Power Networks is required to install the connection in the time scale&#13;
        it has agreed with the customer (mandatory requirement: the Electricity&#13;
        (Connection Standards of Performance) Regulations 2010). This means&#13;
        that the customer may arrange with the supplier for the meter to be&#13;
        installed and supply to commence immediately following the installation&#13;
        of the connection.&#13;

        * Receive meter installation and internal wiring inspection by meter&#13;
        operator, then electricity flow&#13;
&#13;
        The metering industry in the UK is an open competitive market, and the&#13;
        applicant can choose their own Meter Operator or can choose to use the&#13;
        Meter Operator services provided by the electricity supplier. The&#13;
        electricity supplier normally appoints the meter operator. Requirements&#13;
        regarding the conclusion of the meter operation contract vary. The&#13;
        applicant can sign a separate contract with the chosen meter operator or&#13;
        cost can be passed on through the supply contract .&#13;
        The internal wiring must be completed by the electrician to BS7671&#13;
        standards. The electrician must carry out a full inspection and testing of&#13;
        the internal wiring and then provide a BS7671 certificate to both the&#13;
        meter operator and to the electricity distributor before the connection    14 calendar days        GBP 0&#13;
   4&#13;
        can be energized. The inspection of the internal wiring is done when a&#13;
        meter is installed. Inspection of internal wiring is done through a visual&#13;
        inspection by a meter operator. It is a good practice that somebody is&#13;
        present during the installation of the meter/internal wiring inspection.&#13;
&#13;
        The metering must be installed before a supply of electricity can be&#13;
        provided. The electricity can start flowing on the same day the external&#13;
        connection works are finished providing the supplier and the metering&#13;
        operator have sufficient notice.&#13;

Reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index&#13;
&#13;
The reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs      Doing Business uses the system average interruption&#13;
index encompasses quantitative data on the duration        duration index (SAIDI) and the system average&#13;
and frequency of power outages as well as                  interruption frequency index (SAIFI) to measure the&#13;
qualitative information on the mechanisms put in           duration and frequency of power outages in the largest&#13;
place by the utility for monitoring power outages          business city of each economy (for 11 economies the data&#13;
and restoring power supply, the reporting                  are also collected for the second largest business city).&#13;
relationship between the utility and the regulator for     SAIDI is the average total duration of outages over the&#13;
power outages, the transparency and accessibility of       course of a year for each customer served, while SAIFI is&#13;
tariffs and whether the utility faces a financial          the average number of service interruptions experienced&#13;
deterrent aimed at limiting outages (such as a             by a customer in a year. Annual data (covering the&#13;
requirement to compensate customers or pay fines           calendar year) are collected from distribution utility&#13;

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the&#13;
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12&#13;
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does&#13;
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of&#13;
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about&#13;
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for&#13;
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff&#13;
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.&#13;

       any limitations. If the land is unregistered, the solicitor would have to&#13;
       look at the deeds and correspondence between the persons that appear&#13;

      â&#128;¢ Local Authority Search&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Planning history (eg. permissions)&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Desktop environmental search (to determine any environmental issues,&#13;
      such as flooding or contamination)&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Public highway search&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Chancel repair liability search (in this case the solicitor does not search&#13;
      the property itself, but the area in which the property is. If the area turns&#13;
      out to be affected by the liability to contribute to chancel repairs, then&#13;
      the property has to be insured against any future chancel repair claims.&#13;
      The amount of the insurance depends on the value of the property)&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Other searches depending on the area, eg. coal mine shaft search or&#13;
      underground search (these issues affect the value of the property)&#13;
      3. Seller company search: to see the articles of association and what&#13;
      powers the representatives have&#13;
&#13;
      For a property in London, solicitors usually request most of these&#13;
      searches through a search portal. These search portals are the one stop&#13;
      shop for most searches, and solicitors need a user name to access them.&#13;
      The search portals will pass on to the solicitor the information that they&#13;
      acquire from the relevant authorities.&#13;
&#13;
      In total, these searches are usually 300 to 1000 pounds, depending on&#13;
      the number of searches requested, the amount that each local authority&#13;
      charges, and whether the solicitor requests the standard searches or is&#13;
      adding additional questions, which increase the cost. The results of the&#13;
      searches take from one day to 2/3 weeks to come back, depending on&#13;
      the search. The local authority search is the lengthiest one.&#13;
&#13;
      Once satisfied with the results of the searches, the information provided&#13;
      in the standard enquiries and the title pack, the buyer's solicitor will&#13;
      prepare a report for the buyer on the title and other matters affecting&#13;
      the property.&#13;

      Drafting of contracts and exchange of contracts once agreed&#13;
&#13;
      Property transactions are conducted by licensed conveyancers or&#13;
      solicitors. However, in the case of commercial properties, these&#13;
      transactions are usually conducted by solicitors. The seller's solicitor will       1 day&#13;
      prepare a draft of the contract and submit it to the purchaser's solicitor                          included in&#13;

      draft and suggest any suitable amendments. Once the two parties&#13;
      agree on the contract, contracts are exchanged. The solicitors acting for&#13;
      the buyer and seller can meet to exchange contracts, but that is rare. The&#13;
      exchange is usually done over the telephone in accordance with a&#13;
      specific formula for exchanging contracts over the phone. The most&#13;

      by his client. The solicitors agree over the phone specific terms of the&#13;
      contract (e.g., the amount of the deposit, completion date, etc.) and&#13;
      record the time of exchange and other details. Each solicitor sends their&#13;
      client's part contract to the other solicitor in the post that day. The&#13;
      buyer's solicitor will also send a check for the deposit (usually 10% of the&#13;
      purchase price). It is usual for there to be a gap in time between&#13;
      exchange of contracts and completion of the transfer of the property.&#13;

      Complete and lodge a Land Transaction Return and pay the Stamp&#13;
      Duty Land Tax (SDLT) (available on-line)&#13;
&#13;
      The buyer's solicitor would usually prepare the Land Transaction Return&#13;
      for the approval of the buyer (as SDLT is a self-assessment tax) prior to&#13;
      completion. For every land transaction the purchaser must complete,&#13;
      sign and send the land transaction return to be received by HM Revenue&#13;
      &amp; Customs before the end of 30 days following the effective date of the&#13;
      transaction. The return includes a self-assessment of the stamp duty land&#13;
      tax chargeable on the transaction returned. The completed Land&#13;
      Transaction Return must be sent by post to the Revenue's Rapid Data&#13;
      Capture center in Netherton (near Liverpool) or submitted electronically&#13;
      (functionality available since 2006). When the Return is submitted, the&#13;
      correct amount of SDLT must also be paid either by cheque, through the Less than a day&#13;
5     CHAPS automated payment system or via direct bank transfer. Once the            (online  GBP 13 + 4% SDLT&#13;

      Transaction Return Certificate. If the Return has been submitted&#13;
      electronically, the Certificate is typically received within two hours (since&#13;
      2009). If the Return has been submitted in the post, the Certificate is&#13;
      typically received within one month. The issue of a Land Transaction&#13;
      Return Certificate merely evidences that a Return has been filed at the&#13;
      Revenue; issuance of a Certificate does not necessarily mean that the&#13;
      information contained within the Return and/or amount of SDLT paid is&#13;
      correct. The Certificate must be sent to the Land Registry when an&#13;
      application for registration of the transfer is made. If the buyer acquires&#13;
      the property with financing, any legal charge created by it (if it is a&#13;
      company) must be registered at Companies House within 21 days of its&#13;
      creation, failing which the charge is void against a liquidator or another&#13;
      creditor of the company.&#13;

        The law requires conveyancers, from 10 November 2008, when they&#13;
        submit an application to register the interest of their client in a property,&#13;
        to provide details of the conveyancers who acted for all other parties&#13;
        involved in the transaction. If any involved person (including a company)&#13;
        is not represented by a conveyancer, the person lodging the application&#13;
        must either confirm that they are satisfied that sufficient steps have been&#13;
        taken to verify the identity of the unrepresented person or otherwise&#13;
        lodge evidence of the unrepresented person's identity. If confirmation&#13;
        of identity is required for an application, but is not provided, the Land&#13;

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal&#13;
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:&#13;
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the&#13;
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is&#13;
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.&#13;

                            BizBank will most likely apply for the administration procedure. The directors&#13;
                               could file for administration or else BizBank could put the company into&#13;
                           administration since it appears to have a floating charge over substantially the&#13;
                             whole of the company's property. Administration would be the most likely&#13;
                           procedure to be chosen since it is a rescue procedure, designed to save all or&#13;
                           part of the business. It would be more likely to preserve value for the creditors&#13;
Proceedin reorganization&#13;
                             than a liquidation, where fire sales can depress the value of the company's&#13;
g&#13;
                          property. An administrator's first objective is to rescue the company as a going&#13;
                            concern, if possible. If this is not possible, his objective is to achieve a better&#13;
                         result for the company's creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company&#13;
                         were wound up, or failing that he must realize property to make a distribution to&#13;
                                                    secured or preferential creditors.&#13;
&#13;
                               The administrator will be focused on achieving the best outcome for the&#13;
                            creditors as a whole and in this case, this would be achieved by the sale of the&#13;
                          business as a going concern. The administration moratorium provides protection&#13;
                            for the company from various creditor enforcement actions: - enforcement of&#13;
                                security- repossession of hire-purchase goods- forfeiture by landlords-&#13;
                             commencement of legal proceedings against the company. This moratorium&#13;
                             gives the company a breathing space in which to implement a solution to its&#13;
Outcome     going concern     financial difficulties. The administrator takes over from the directors in the&#13;
                           management of the company and has broad powers to carry on the business of&#13;
                          the company so that it can continue to operate as a going concern. He can enter&#13;
                              into new contracts on behalf of the company and pay the expenses of the&#13;
                           administration in priority to all other creditors (apart from fixed charge holders)&#13;
                            so that the business can continue to operate. The hotel is likely to be sold as a&#13;
                              going concern. The administrator may continue to trade the business from&#13;
                                                 administration while seeking a purchaser.&#13;
&#13;
                               The administration procedure will take approximately one year. BizBank, the&#13;
                            company's directors (probably with BizBank's approval), or (less likely in practice)&#13;
                             the company acting on a majority resolution of its shareholders could apply for&#13;
                            the company's administration. If BizBank puts the company into administration, it&#13;
                               would give notice of intention to appoint administrators to any prior ranking&#13;
                              qualifying floating charge holder (N.B. this can be dispensed with if BizBank is&#13;
                             certain there are no such charge holders). 2 business days later, BizBank would&#13;
 Time (in                    file a notice of appointment of administrator (and various short accompanying&#13;
                  1.0          documents) at court. The administrator's appointment takes effect from the&#13;
years)&#13;
                                    moment of this filing. If the directors/company were to appoint the&#13;
                            administrator, they would give notice of intention to appoint to BizBank. BizBank&#13;
                            could either consent to the director/company's choice of administrator (probable&#13;
                             since in practice the directors would probably consult BizBank on the choice of&#13;
                                  administrator) or appoint its own choice of administrator following the&#13;
                              procedure above. Upon receiving Bizbank's consent, or after 5 business days if&#13;

                                appointment takes effect from the moment of this filing. The administrator is&#13;
                               obliged to advertise his appointment, to send notice of his appointment to all&#13;
                                    creditors of whom he is aware and to give his name and the fact of the&#13;
                                      administration on all business documents issued by the company or&#13;
                                                  administrator and on any company website.&#13;
                               The administrator would take control of the management of the company and&#13;
                                     continue to run the hotel whilst seeking a buyer for the business. The&#13;
                              administrator's duty on any sale is to achieve fair market value at the time of the&#13;
                                sale, although he is not obliged to wait to sell in case more favorable market&#13;
                                conditions materialize. The administrator is not obliged to seek the creditors'&#13;
                               consent before concluding a sale but he would likely discuss any potential sale&#13;
                              with BizBank as the secured creditor who stands to recover its loan from the sale&#13;
                               proceeds. Within the first 8 weeks, the administrator must send a statement of&#13;
                               his proposals to all creditors and shareholders detailing, amongst other things,&#13;
                               (a) how he envisages the purpose of administration will/has been achieved (in&#13;
                              this case, sale of the business) and how the administration will be brought to an&#13;

                                remuneration will be fixed. The administrator must hold a creditors' meeting&#13;
                              within the first 10 weeks to approve his proposals. This creditors' meeting is not&#13;
                                  required if the company has insufficient property to make a distribution to&#13;
                                 unsecured creditors (which may be the case here), although in this situation&#13;
                                 creditors with at least 10% of the total debts can order the administrator to&#13;
                                    summon a creditors' meeting if they wish. The administrator would also&#13;
                                 investigate the affairs of the company, in particular (a) directors' conduct to&#13;
                               establish whether there are any grounds for a potential disqualification action;&#13;
                                and (b) recent transactions to determine whether he should apply to court to&#13;

                               defrauding creditors. The administrator would pay out BizBank after receiving&#13;
                                     the sale proceeds and deducting the expenses of the administration.&#13;

Doing Business presents results for two aggregate             even though it is no longer at the frontier in a&#13;

doing business ranking, which is based on the distance&#13;

The distance to frontier score captures the gap between&#13;

practice across the entire sample of 36 indicators for 10     extreme outliers in the distributions of the rescaled data&#13;
Doing Business topics (the labor market regulation            for most component indicators (very few economies&#13;

Calculating the distance to frontier score for each           or construction, including legal index scores (such as the&#13;

the nonlinear transformation, an increase in the total tax&#13;
rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier&#13;

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it&#13;
would have had before this approach was adopted in&#13;
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in&#13;
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for&#13;
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is&#13;
very high relative to the average), an increase has a&#13;
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores&#13;
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line&#13;
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).&#13;

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and&#13;
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to&#13;
that from the simple average method because both these methods&#13;
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise&#13;
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the&#13;
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,&#13;
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the&#13;
context of a specific economy.&#13;
5&#13;
  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according&#13;
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned&#13;
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit&#13;
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal&#13;
weights&#13;

            Doing business 2016 : measuring regulatory
            quality and efficiency - United Kingdom
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This economy profile for Doing Business
            2016 presents the 11 Doing Business indicators for United
            Kingdom. To allow for useful comparison, the profile also
            provides data for other selected economies (comparator
            economies) for each indicator. Doing Business 2016 is the
            13th edition in a series of annual reports measuring the
            regulations that enhance business activity and those that
            constrain it. Economies are ranked on their ease of doing
            business; for 2015 United Kingdom ranks 6. A high ease of
            doing business ranking means the regulatory environment is
            more conducive to the starting and operation of a local
            firm. Doing Business presents quantitative indicators on
            business regulations and the protection of property rights
            that can be compared across 189 economies from Afghanistan
            to Zimbabwe and over time. Doing Business sheds light on how
            easy or difficult it is for a local entrepreneur to open and
            run a small to medium-size business when complying with
            relevant regulations. It measures and tracks changes in
            regulations affecting 11 areas in the life cycle of a
            business: starting a business, dealing with construction
            permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
            credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
            across borders, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency
            and labor market regulation. The data in this report are
            current as of June 1, 2015 (except for the paying taxes
            indicators, which cover the period from January to December 2014).
