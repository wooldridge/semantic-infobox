        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The vehicle inspection program in Mexico
            City is regard as one of the most successful in a developing
            country. As the program evolved it suffered the problem
            common to most such scheme in developing countries -- high
            levels of evasion. But the program now operates well,
            through high volume, test-only centers entirely in the hands
            of the private sector. As an increasing number of developing
            country cities consider how to enforce emissions standards
            as a way to control transport-related air pollution, Mexico
            City offers valuable lessons on how to ensure compliance.
