the Argentine Republic, which in turn has a subsid -&#13;
iary loan agreement with the newly created Back-           !E 96.&#13;

by the government and managed by an internation-          V Argentine&#13;
ally recognized financial manager. The financial          LRepublic &#13;

meet established standards of credit to participate in&#13;
the program. Banks that participate will be required&#13;
to demonstrate that their pool of term loans meeting&#13;
certain qualifying criteria grows by at least as much     FParticipating&#13;

            "Backstop" lending for capital
            market development in Argentina
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This Note discusses the Argentine
            Capital Market Development loan, approved by the World
            Bank's executive directors in March 1994.  The Bank
            provides a US$500 million loan to the Argentine Republic,
            which in turn has a subsidiary loan agreement with the newly
            created Backstop Fund.  Banks that meet established
            standards of credit to participate will be required to
            demonstrate that their pool of term loans meeting certain
            qualifying criteria grows by at least as much as the
            issuance of backstopped bonds.  This project addressed
            systemic risk and other aspects of market development.  The
            project has become known in the World Bank as the
            "Backstop Facility."  But that name does not do
            justice to the scope of the project because it does not
            reflect its important development features.  This Note
            describes the project design and how it differs from
            traditional World Bank lending.  It also explains why this
            structure was chosen and how it will allow banks to provide
            longer-term loans to qualifying borrowers.  In general, the
            rollover facility concept underlying the Backstop Fund will
            apply to those countries whose markets have begun to
            develop, but are constrained by longer-term liquidity
            concerns, the absence of broadly used financial instruments,
            and the lack of well-established institutions.
