            Telling our story : infrastructure - how
            the private sector helps
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This issue focuses on IFC's support
            for Infrastructure, with a special focus on Africa. The
            private sector brings an entrepreneurial, results-driven
            approach to infrastructure. It can make a major difference.
            Complementing the role of government, market-based solutions
            can expand the provision of essential services at affordable
            rates, improving the quality of life in local communities in
            measurable ways often through PPPs. This is IFC's
            focus: private infrastructure projects whose innovative,
            high-impact business models can be scaled up for wider
            replication. Bringing together three distinct businesses
            (investment services, advisory services, and asset
            management) IFC helps the infrastructure industry address
            some of today's greatest development challenges: 1)
            climate change, investing more than $1.6 billion in
            renewable energy and energy efficiency projects; 2) water,
            hosting the Water Resources Group, a new collaborative
            effort that helps countries use private sector thinking in
            finding the best solutions to their water needs; 3) food
            security, supporting a wide range of projects to reduce
            losses and increase efficiency in the food supply
            chain-managing the private sector window of the G20's
            Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, for example,
            and helping India's Punjab state government attract $8
            million in private investment for new state-ofthe-art,
            long-term wheat storage silos; 4) fragility and conflict,
            helping Liberia and Haiti, Iraq, the West Bank and Gaza and
            others attractive private capital and expertise for their
            infrastructure needs; 5) base of the pyramid, expanding
            low-cost private infrastructure businesses that especially
            target the poorest consumers, such as Altobridge's
            remote telecom access service.
