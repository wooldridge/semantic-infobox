Interview with General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
By Robert Oliver                                    July 14, 1961&#13;

&#13;
General Wheeler:   Iâ&#128;&#153;m Raymond A. Wheeler.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Would you identify yourself for the tape?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
General Wheeler:   Iâ&#128;&#153;m Raymond A. Wheeler, lieutenant general of&#13;
&#13;
the US Army retired, now serving as a consultant in the&#13;
&#13;
International Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   And when did you come to the Bank?    What were the&#13;
&#13;
circumstances?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
General Wheeler:   On March 1, 1949, I reported to the Bank, for&#13;
&#13;
duty in the newly created position of engineering advisor.     I had&#13;
&#13;
just retired from the United States Army, where I was serving as&#13;
&#13;
Chief of the Corps of Engineers.     I succeeded Mr. Michael J.&#13;
&#13;
Madigan, whose firm, Madigan and Highland, had been the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
consultant on engineering activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Had they had a full-time engineering staff before then?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   No.   No.   The engineering staff was organized then upon&#13;
&#13;
my arrival.   There were two well qualified engineers, Messrs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 1 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                            General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Rembrandt and Spottswood, working on projects, and they were&#13;
&#13;
brought in to the newly organized engineering staff, and from&#13;
&#13;
that small nucleus, supplemented from time to time by selected&#13;
&#13;
specialists, grew the present staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Could you tell us a little bit about the work of the&#13;
&#13;
engineering staff, since youâ&#128;&#153;ve been at the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Yes, the engineering staff, which has now been&#13;
&#13;
incorporated into the technical operations department, and no&#13;
&#13;
longer exists as an engineering staff, but its members are&#13;
&#13;
assigned to the appropriate divisions of that department,&#13;
&#13;
consisting of the various types of projects--utilities,&#13;
&#13;
agriculture, industry and so forth.    Engineering in the Bank has&#13;
&#13;
been and is being conducted strictly in accordance with the&#13;
&#13;
ethical principles of the engineering profession.   The Bank&#13;
&#13;
enjoys the respect and confidence of both the engineering&#13;
&#13;
profession and the construction industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Are there some particular projects that youâ&#128;&#153;ve worked on that&#13;
&#13;
would be interesting to preserve for history?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Well, I worked on a great many projects, but perhaps&#13;
&#13;
those that had a special interest for me came right in the early&#13;
&#13;
days of the Bank.   While most of them were small in cost,&#13;
&#13;
compared to those that came along later, they were of special&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 2 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                            General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
interest to me because I had been stationed, before coming to the&#13;
&#13;
Bank, in some of the areas concerned, and knew at first hand of&#13;
&#13;
the needs.   I knew that these projects were economically&#13;
&#13;
justified, and that they had been urgently needed for a long&#13;
&#13;
time.   If youâ&#128;&#153;d like me to mention--&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   --yes, would you mention a few of them?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:    Well, almost one of the first I worked on was the flood&#13;
&#13;
protection project in Iraq, and just before the beginning of&#13;
&#13;
World War II, I was assigned to a military mission in the Persian&#13;
&#13;
Gulf involving supply of arms, equipment and so forth to the&#13;
&#13;
Russians.    Our headquarters were in the city of Baghdad, Iraq,&#13;
&#13;
located on the Tigris River.   Baghdad had been subjected to&#13;
&#13;
floods over the centuries, and it had finally been protected by a&#13;
&#13;
ringbund around the city, which, however, was overtopped whenever&#13;
&#13;
major floods occurred, thereby causing millions of dollars in&#13;
&#13;
damages.    The Bank made a loan for the construction of works to&#13;
&#13;
give permanent protection to the city of Baghdad and surrounding&#13;
&#13;
area by the construction of a dam across the Tigris River, about&#13;
&#13;
50 miles above Baghdad, at which point excess flood waters were&#13;
&#13;
diverted through the canal to a large uninhabited and barren&#13;
&#13;
depression called Wadi Tartar.    Besides the benefit provided by&#13;
&#13;
these works in protecting the city of Baghdad from the flood&#13;
&#13;
overflows, there is another important benefit resulting from them&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 3 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                            General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
in that the severe dust storms that originated in the Wadi Tartar&#13;
&#13;
will be prevented.&#13;
&#13;
     Another project that is associated with my previous service&#13;
&#13;
was the railway rehabilitation project in Thailand.    While I was&#13;
&#13;
serving in the military theater of China-Burma-India, it was&#13;
&#13;
necessary to prescribe targets for bombing missions upon&#13;
&#13;
Japanese-occupied Thailand.   The principal targets selected were,&#13;
&#13;
of course, railway bridges and workshops.    Working later as an&#13;
&#13;
engineer in the Bank, a project for their rehabilitation was&#13;
&#13;
approved and a loan recommended.    This work has been completed.&#13;
&#13;
     Still another project that has an association with my&#13;
&#13;
previous service was an agricultural project in India.     There are&#13;
&#13;
thousands of acres of level prairie land in central India,&#13;
&#13;
consisting of a heavy black soil that is infested with a weed&#13;
&#13;
called Kans grass.   If the weed is eradicated, the soil will&#13;
&#13;
produce satisfactory crops.   After some research and experimental&#13;
&#13;
work, it was found that if the roots of the weed are exposed to&#13;
&#13;
the high temperatures of the summer climate, they become&#13;
&#13;
desiccated and do not grow again.    To turn up the roots requires&#13;
&#13;
deep plowing, and as the soil is hard, large powerful tractors&#13;
&#13;
must be employed.    The Bank made a loan to purchase this heavy&#13;
&#13;
machinery.   Fortunately, there was a tractor organization in&#13;
&#13;
India that had been developed after the war, using the equipment&#13;
&#13;
left behind in India by the departing military forces.&#13;
&#13;
Consequently, the tractors purchased under the Bank loan could be&#13;
&#13;
assigned to an organization already trained in operation and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 4 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
maintenance.   It became the largest tractor organization in Asia&#13;
&#13;
engaged in a single project.    This project is now completed, and&#13;
&#13;
the land is producing wheat.    Before the completion of the&#13;
&#13;
project, however, and during the clearing of the land, India&#13;
&#13;
suffered a famine which was finally relieved by importation of&#13;
&#13;
wheat from the United States.    These needs now can be met from&#13;
&#13;
her own production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   If I might ask a question about this project, Iâ&#128;&#153;ve heard that&#13;
&#13;
in this particular case there was some difficulty because the&#13;
&#13;
Indians who received the tractors did not maintain them properly,&#13;
&#13;
and the Bank learned from this that it had to insist upon&#13;
&#13;
management of local projects in connection with its loans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Yes, thatâ&#128;&#153;s true, and we made a trip out there with a&#13;
&#13;
machinery expert who was helpful in getting the maintenance&#13;
&#13;
organization re-established.    They had had one, but it had been&#13;
&#13;
dissipated and gone to other work, and it was a matter of&#13;
&#13;
reassembling it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   In what sense had they gone to other work?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Well, other work in India.   They needed it for other&#13;
&#13;
shops and they took the people away.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   This was the Indian government itself?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 5 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:    The various ministries that needed the men.   But it was&#13;
&#13;
working very satisfactorily shortly after.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So it was not that the Indians didnâ&#128;&#153;t know how to maintain&#13;
&#13;
the tractors, but some sort of departmental decision took the&#13;
&#13;
crews away?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:    Well, there had been a trained maintenance organization&#13;
&#13;
which had been developed right after the war from this machinery,&#13;
&#13;
so that it had to be expanded because of the increase in the&#13;
&#13;
number of machines that were assigned to the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Are there other projects?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:    Well, thereâ&#128;&#153;s another one thatâ&#128;&#153;s of interest because I&#13;
&#13;
went over in connection with the project, and that was in&#13;
&#13;
Ethiopia.   Early in the Bank operations they made a loan for both&#13;
&#13;
improvement of highways and of telecommunications there.     The&#13;
&#13;
highways connecting the interior of the country with the ports&#13;
&#13;
were unimproved and poorly drained.      Trucks transporting the&#13;
&#13;
products of the country to the Coast for export were delayed for&#13;
&#13;
days and sometimes weeks, because of the conditions of the roads.&#13;
&#13;
There was a story during these days that transportation of coffee&#13;
&#13;
to the port was cheaper by truck but quicker by donkey back.&#13;
&#13;
      Telecommunications were primitive, there frequently being&#13;
&#13;
only a single telephone in an entire community, and when these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 6 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                             General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
traffic breakdowns occurred, they could not be reported because&#13;
&#13;
of the lack of telecommunications, and help could not be&#13;
&#13;
dispatched to get the traffic moving again.     These projects are&#13;
&#13;
now practically completed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Was there any problem about management in these Ethiopian&#13;
&#13;
projects?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:    Yes.   Yes, there was, and we had sent over a man to&#13;
&#13;
assist in management training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So it became established fairly early in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s history&#13;
&#13;
that the Bank had to insure adequate management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:    Yes, indeed.   That was very important.   Thatâ&#128;&#153;s one of&#13;
&#13;
the first things we explore in connection with our projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   When Bank engineers are working on a particular project, they&#13;
&#13;
work very closely with local engineers?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:    Yes.   In fact, itâ&#128;&#153;s very essential that they establish&#13;
&#13;
a relationship with them right at the beginning of the project,&#13;
&#13;
because theyâ&#128;&#153;re going to carry on later.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Do the engineers, the Bank engineers help the local people&#13;
&#13;
decide where theyâ&#128;&#153;re going to make their purchases?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 7 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                             General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   The purchases are made from advertisements for&#13;
&#13;
international competition, and the bids are awarded to the lowest&#13;
&#13;
bidder, and the currency of that country is the currency that is&#13;
&#13;
loaned to the borrower, for the purpose of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How about drawing up the specifications for the things that&#13;
&#13;
are to be purchased?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Yes, thatâ&#128;&#153;s very important.   And in connection with&#13;
&#13;
that, I might mention that the Indus Basin Settlement Plan is now&#13;
&#13;
being implemented.     Itâ&#128;&#153;s going to involve some ten years of&#13;
&#13;
construction, and it requires a matter of a year or two to&#13;
&#13;
prepare accurate specifications for the large items that are&#13;
&#13;
involved in that project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   And the Bank engineers will work on this the whole time?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Well, no.   I might tell you, if you like, a little of&#13;
&#13;
the Indus Basin Settlement Plan.    I think one of the most&#13;
&#13;
important projects undertaken by the Bank was this Indus Basin&#13;
&#13;
Settlement Plan.   Historically, under the auspices of the World&#13;
&#13;
Bank, negotiations between India and Pakistan for the conclusion&#13;
&#13;
of an international water treaty in settlement of the Indus Basin&#13;
&#13;
water dispute were successfully completed and final agreement&#13;
&#13;
reached after eight years of discussions.    The water treaty was&#13;
&#13;
signed in September, 1960.    The dispute over the apportionment of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 8 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the waters of the Indus River system, which originated over 40&#13;
&#13;
years ago, between two provinces of undivided India, became an&#13;
&#13;
international dispute between India and Pakistan when India was&#13;
&#13;
partitioned and the boundary line passed through one of these two&#13;
&#13;
provinces, leaving a portion of this province in each of the two&#13;
&#13;
dominions.&#13;
&#13;
     President Black proffered the good offices of the Bank in a&#13;
&#13;
solution of the problem.   This was accepted by the two&#13;
&#13;
governments, and the discussions began in May, 1952.   They were&#13;
&#13;
concluded in September, 1960, with the signing of a water treaty.&#13;
&#13;
This treaty is based on a division of the Indus waters along the&#13;
&#13;
lines of a proposal made by the Bank to the two governments in&#13;
&#13;
February, 1954.   Under the proposal the three eastern rivers of&#13;
&#13;
the Indus system â&#128;&#147; that is the Sutlej, the Beas and the Ravi â&#128;&#147;&#13;
&#13;
are for the use of India, and the three western rivers, the&#13;
&#13;
Indus, the Jhelum and the Chenab, are for the use of Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
This division of the waters necessitates the construction of&#13;
&#13;
works to transfer from the three western rivers supplies to meet&#13;
&#13;
the irrigation uses in those areas of Pakistan which have&#13;
&#13;
hitherto depended on supplies from the three eastern rivers.     The&#13;
&#13;
effect of this transfer is to release the whole flow of the three&#13;
&#13;
eastern rivers for irrigation development in India; the system of&#13;
&#13;
works to be constructed will however supply further substantial&#13;
&#13;
additional irrigation development both in India and Pakistan, and&#13;
&#13;
in addition to irrigation will develop important hydroelectric&#13;
&#13;
potential in both countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 9 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      It is estimated that the total cost of the system of works&#13;
&#13;
to achieve these results will be of the order of the equivalent&#13;
&#13;
of 900 million dollars, partly in foreign exchange and partly in&#13;
&#13;
local currency.    The Bank has evolved a plan to finance the&#13;
&#13;
required expenditure, and has assurances from certain friendly&#13;
&#13;
governments of their readiness to participate in the cost of the&#13;
&#13;
plan, over and above the amounts to be contributed by India and&#13;
&#13;
Pakistan and by the Bank itself.   The friendly governments&#13;
&#13;
concerned are Australia, Canada, West Germany, New Zealand, the&#13;
&#13;
United Kingdom and the United States.     The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s financial plan&#13;
&#13;
envisages that all construction contracts will be open to&#13;
&#13;
international competitive bidding, and therefore that the foreign&#13;
&#13;
exchange contributions will be freely usable for purchases&#13;
&#13;
anywhere in the Free World.   The costs of the construction&#13;
&#13;
program will be spread over a period of approximately ten years,&#13;
&#13;
and the general supervision of the program will be undertaken by&#13;
&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
      I donâ&#128;&#153;t know whether youâ&#128;&#153;d like just a summary of what the&#13;
&#13;
works program consists of?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   In connection with the Indus? .... yesâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:    -- yesâ&#128;¦ the works program which, by the way,&#13;
&#13;
constitutes the largest construction operation under way in the&#13;
&#13;
world today, consists of two large rock-filled dams, one on the&#13;
&#13;
Jhelum River and one on the Indus.      The amount of excavation and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 10 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
fill for each of these two dams totals over 200 million cubic&#13;
&#13;
yards.   The eight link canals to transfer supplies to the eastern&#13;
&#13;
rivers have an aggregate length of 388 miles, and involve&#13;
&#13;
excavation totaling 385 million cubic yards.     There are to be&#13;
&#13;
constructed also four new barrages, having an aggregate length of&#13;
&#13;
15,000 feet, and a siphon 2300 feet long.     In addition,&#13;
&#13;
remodeling will be necessary of three existing links, three&#13;
&#13;
headworks and seven canal systems.      The amount of equipment,&#13;
&#13;
materials and supplies needed for the program is tremendous.&#13;
&#13;
Cement requirements total over 1,600,000 tons.     Sand and&#13;
&#13;
aggregates, 3,500,000 tons.    Revetment material, 2,400,000 tons.&#13;
&#13;
Steel, 250,000 tons, and a million tons of petroleum products.&#13;
&#13;
Itâ&#128;&#153;s estimated that the cost of ocean freight for transportation&#13;
&#13;
of plant and supplies will be of the order of 20 to 25 million&#13;
&#13;
dollars.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Iâ&#128;&#153;m curious about the political aspects, if any, of this&#13;
&#13;
particular project.    Would you say that the construction will be&#13;
&#13;
any different because two countries are involved from what it&#13;
&#13;
would be if it were all within one country?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   No.   No, the reason we say that â&#128;&#147;- it is being built&#13;
&#13;
strictly as an engineering project.      For example, each dam has a&#13;
&#13;
reputable engineering firm engaged on the design.     One of the&#13;
&#13;
dams has a British firm, the other dam has an American firm.       The&#13;
&#13;
barrages are being designed by an experienced and well-known&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 11 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                            General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
British firm.   The canals are being engineered by an American&#13;
&#13;
firm.   Then, over all of these firms, for each specific element&#13;
&#13;
of the project, is a firm employed by the Pakistan authority&#13;
&#13;
thatâ&#128;&#153;s operating the project.    So itâ&#128;&#153;s all very well engineered.&#13;
&#13;
And then the Bank itself has employed an engineering firm as its&#13;
&#13;
advisor and for a check, during all the whole operation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What is the role of the engineers who are full-time members&#13;
&#13;
of the Bank, then?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Well, itâ&#128;&#153;s handled by the technical operations&#13;
&#13;
department, and the report from the various engineering firms&#13;
&#13;
come in to just a small staff in the technical operations&#13;
&#13;
department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   And this small staff does what?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   They check the program and schedule for the operations.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank is the administrator of the fund, so they allocate the&#13;
&#13;
funds to the work, too.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What would happen if there were a difference of opinion&#13;
&#13;
between an engineer on the Bank staff and an engineer in one of&#13;
&#13;
these consulting teams or firms involved in the consulting&#13;
&#13;
itself?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 12 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Well, due to the very high grade firms that have been&#13;
&#13;
employed, while there have been differences, they were points&#13;
&#13;
that could be and have been talked out and agreed.   In one case,&#13;
&#13;
pertaining to a technical feature of the big earth dam, to&#13;
&#13;
satisfy all the engineers, a panel was employed of&#13;
&#13;
internationally known engineers on construction of earth dams,&#13;
&#13;
and that was agreed, so that in case of any disagreement, itâ&#128;&#153;s a&#13;
&#13;
technical matter that can be agreed by having the proper&#13;
&#13;
consultants assigned to it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   In the case of project planning or loan negotiation before it&#13;
&#13;
has even been agreed that the Bank is going to finance a project,&#13;
&#13;
what specifically do the engineers of the Bank do?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Well, they have to make an investigation and study of&#13;
&#13;
the project, from a technical point of view, and determine its&#13;
&#13;
technical feasibility, and that involves all the detailed&#13;
&#13;
engineering in connection with the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Does the Bank engineer actually do the detailed engineering?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   No, they appraise the reports that are submitted by the&#13;
&#13;
engineers employed by the borrower on the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   And do they pass on cost estimates?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 13 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                             General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Yes, they have to check the cost estimates because that&#13;
&#13;
determines the amount of the loan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure in your work with the Army Engineers you came across&#13;
&#13;
the concept of benefit cost analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Yes.   Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Is this sort of procedure followed in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Yes, it is also in the Bank, very much the same, yes.&#13;
&#13;
In fact, the procedures in the Bank are the recognized procedures&#13;
&#13;
or the approved procedures among the various branches of the US&#13;
&#13;
government in connection with these projects.    In fact, itâ&#128;&#153;s the&#13;
&#13;
way projects are analyzed and appraised in all the European&#13;
&#13;
countries too.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Do the engineers in the Bank get involved in the&#13;
&#13;
determination of benefits as well as costs?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Yes.   Yes, thatâ&#128;&#153;s a part.   Of course, there are&#13;
&#13;
economists assigned to the study of the project, too.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Who are some of the Bank economists whoâ&#128;&#153;ve been involved in&#13;
&#13;
the Indus Project?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 14 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                            General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Well, there have been several groups that have worked&#13;
&#13;
on it.    The big problem on the Indus Basin water dispute was&#13;
&#13;
primarily to get the two sides to agree to a general plan, and&#13;
&#13;
the economics of various plans had been thoroughly discussed&#13;
&#13;
between the three sides, the Pakistan group, the Indian group and&#13;
&#13;
the Bank group, and each supported by its own economists, so each&#13;
&#13;
particular element was very thoroughly discussed by three groups&#13;
&#13;
of engineers and economists.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What were some of the issues in contention among these&#13;
&#13;
groups?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler: Oh, in a period of eight years, you can visualize how&#13;
&#13;
everything was in contention.    In fact, from the beginning the&#13;
&#13;
simplest things that it seemed to us should be agreed on, neither&#13;
&#13;
side would agree to.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Could you illustrate this, what you mean by â&#128;&#156;simplest&#13;
&#13;
thingsâ&#128;??&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Well, I could get them out of the record, but I canâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
recite them offhand.   The greatest disadvantage to the group in&#13;
&#13;
starting their discussions was the fact that we were able to get&#13;
&#13;
the two sides in agreement on the basic data that would&#13;
&#13;
constitute the -- that would be used for our planning.    For 25&#13;
&#13;
years undivided India had kept very careful records of the flow&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 15 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
discharge of the stream, at certain measuring points, and we had&#13;
&#13;
that, those daily readings for 25 years, and those, after,&#13;
&#13;
shortly after we started meeting, were agreed between the two&#13;
&#13;
sides, and we had the detailed data for all that 25 years to base&#13;
&#13;
our studies on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   This was important in order to know the minimum amount of&#13;
&#13;
water you could be certain of per year?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Yes, it was important in order to know the quantities&#13;
&#13;
that we were dealing with and the timeliness of it.   On the Indus&#13;
&#13;
River, which has an average annual flow of 168 million acre feet,&#13;
&#13;
there were about 70 million acre feet going waste to the sea&#13;
&#13;
every year.   The problem in irrigation was not just the volume of&#13;
&#13;
flow but the timeliness of the flow, because the flows would be&#13;
&#13;
low in certain growing or maturing seasons, so that that was the&#13;
&#13;
basic element of the dispute.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How was it finally decided that the two governments were&#13;
&#13;
going to share the costs of the whole project?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Well, Mr. Black himself is responsible for raising the&#13;
&#13;
funds necessary to pay the costs of the plan.    They are not&#13;
&#13;
sharing cost.   These friendly governments are contributing&#13;
&#13;
considerable grant money to finance the project.   The Bank, of&#13;
&#13;
course, having made a creditworthiness study of the countries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 16 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                             General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
involved, knew the limit to which they could participate in this,&#13;
&#13;
and therefore they had to be helped in the financing of it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   From the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s point of view, the project could not have&#13;
&#13;
been financed totally by loan of funds?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   No, it could not have been.   The two great achievements&#13;
&#13;
in this settlement plan are, first of all, that they can go ahead&#13;
&#13;
and develop the irrigation which is a matter of life and death to&#13;
&#13;
them there, and almost important is that it settles a political&#13;
&#13;
dispute, so that they can go ahead peacefully and develop there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What was the political dispute?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   It was over the possibility of the diversion by India&#13;
&#13;
to her own uses of a greater share of the river than Pakistan&#13;
&#13;
felt that she should take; India is certainly in a position to&#13;
&#13;
divert enough of the flow of the river to be harmful to Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Do you know of any other Bank projects in which the actual&#13;
&#13;
costs of the project are being borne by granting organizations or&#13;
&#13;
countries?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   No, I donâ&#128;&#153;t know of any.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   This is perhaps the only one, unique?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 17 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                            General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   I think it probably is the only one, and it is&#13;
&#13;
important because it does solve a political dispute between the&#13;
&#13;
two, the water dispute, and both countries are members of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank, and this will promote the economic welfare of both.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What sort of compensation is worked out to repay Pakistan for&#13;
&#13;
giving up the water that is going to be diverted to India?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Thereâ&#128;&#153;s a very careful balance that was struck on that&#13;
&#13;
between the two countries.   The settlement plan itself is&#13;
&#13;
concerned to have made an equitable distribution of the waters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Are all the engineers on the staff of the Bank employed in&#13;
&#13;
the technical operations division?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Yes, theyâ&#128;&#153;re all in the technical operations&#13;
&#13;
department, and theyâ&#128;&#153;re assigned to various divisions within that&#13;
&#13;
department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Theyâ&#128;&#153;re not in the area departments, for example.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   No.   No, theyâ&#128;&#153;re all in the technical operations&#13;
&#13;
department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 18 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                             General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So the engineers in the Bank come into loan negotiation only&#13;
&#13;
after your concern with the Bank, the concern with determining&#13;
&#13;
what the engineering costs of a proposed project are?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Yes, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Do the engineers ever get involved in proposing projects?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Well, they are sent out on survey missions to make a&#13;
&#13;
general survey of the country, and of course they report on the&#13;
&#13;
projects that appear to be needed for the economic development of&#13;
&#13;
the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Are these survey missions that youâ&#128;&#153;re talking about the ones&#13;
&#13;
that result in official reports of the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Yes.   Yes.   And due to the size of our engineering&#13;
&#13;
staff in the Bank, itâ&#128;&#153;s necessary frequently to employ other&#13;
&#13;
engineers from outside to accompany the mission.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So the engineering staff in the Bank is not large enough of&#13;
&#13;
itself.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   No, they couldnâ&#128;&#153;t possibly carry out all the work&#13;
&#13;
thatâ&#128;&#153;s undertaken by the technical operations department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 19 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Is this an advantage, to be able to hire outside people?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:    Yes, I think it is.    The Bank then doesnâ&#128;&#153;t have to&#13;
&#13;
build up a large staff in order to be able to handle all the&#13;
&#13;
projects.   The responsibility should be put on the borrower to&#13;
&#13;
provide the initial engineering, and then when the Bank itself&#13;
&#13;
sends out a mission, a general survey mission to a country, itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
necessary to employ outside engineering assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   And I suppose in this way the Bank is able to obtain the&#13;
&#13;
advice of specialists.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:    Oh, yes.   Oh, yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   It would be very expensive if they were employed full time on&#13;
&#13;
the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:    Thatâ&#128;&#153;s a very good reason for it.   We can get&#13;
&#13;
specialists without having them as permanent employees, just for&#13;
&#13;
that particular project.    Whatever the nature of the project, we&#13;
&#13;
can hire the consultant services required for it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   About how big is the engineering staff of the Bank, permanent&#13;
&#13;
staff?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  - 20 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                             General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Well, I havenâ&#128;&#153;t totaled it, but I think itâ&#128;&#153;s only five&#13;
&#13;
or six engineers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Oh, a very small number.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   They must be terribly busy with the number of projects that&#13;
&#13;
are being considered by the Bank.    Is this a bottleneck?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   No.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   If the engineering staff were considerably larger, couldnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
more projects be processed?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   No.    No, they keep abreast of the applications.   You&#13;
&#13;
see, these engineers are a pretty busy group, and all the reports&#13;
&#13;
come in from the field from these survey missions, prepared by&#13;
&#13;
the missions, which have members that are engineers.    Itâ&#128;&#153;s a&#13;
&#13;
matter of appraising these reports, you see.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So the greater part of the engineers that are actually&#13;
&#13;
working for the Bank at any given time are people that are hired&#13;
&#13;
on special projects and are not on the permanent staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 21 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Has the Bank had any difficulty in getting engineers for its&#13;
&#13;
staff?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:    Well, I donâ&#128;&#153;t know.    See, I havenâ&#128;&#153;t had anything to do&#13;
&#13;
with that now for several years.      Initially I came into it, and&#13;
&#13;
Iâ&#128;&#153;d just been working on special projects, but I believe they&#13;
&#13;
have had considerable difficulty to get exactly the type they&#13;
&#13;
wanted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Was there ever a time in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s history when it was&#13;
&#13;
considered that there might be an engineering department or&#13;
&#13;
division?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:    I think it was discussed a number of times, but the&#13;
&#13;
present organization seems to be an excellent solution, and a&#13;
&#13;
permanent solution, because it takes care of all types of&#13;
&#13;
technical operations -â&#128;&#147; industry, utilities, power, agriculture,&#13;
&#13;
-- we have those sections too.      And itâ&#128;&#153;s a type of organization&#13;
&#13;
that can be very readily expanded without affecting â&#128;&#147;- just&#13;
&#13;
additional engineers would take care of the increased work load.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Iâ&#128;&#153;m still surprised by this figure of only five.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:    Well, I may be wrong in the exact number, but itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
certainly not more than seven.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Are there other projects that perhaps should be mentioned?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  - 22 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:    Well, Iâ&#128;&#153;ve â&#128;&#147;-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Iâ&#128;&#153;ve heard that there are some interesting things about the&#13;
&#13;
project of the Mekong River?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:    I was on that survey for the United Nations, but the&#13;
&#13;
Bank is not involved in that, except that our representative over&#13;
&#13;
in Thailand serves on an advisory committee to the coordinating&#13;
&#13;
committee of the four governments there.     Thereâ&#128;&#153;s nothing ready&#13;
&#13;
for definite projects, because they have to collect basic data&#13;
&#13;
for an additional period of time.     But sometime, Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure, it&#13;
&#13;
will come to the Bank.      There are four riparian countries on the&#13;
&#13;
Mekong, and one of them, only one of them is not a member of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank.   Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Thailand are all members of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Have you done enough work consulting with the UN that you&#13;
&#13;
could comment on any differences in general approach between the&#13;
&#13;
UN and the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:    No, I donâ&#128;&#153;t think there is any difference.   In fact the&#13;
&#13;
UN is calling on the World Bank to assist them on their special&#13;
&#13;
projects.    And the Bank does help and advise them.   No, I donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
think you could say thereâ&#128;&#153;s a difference of approach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 23 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                             General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Is there any reason to suppose that the projects sponsored&#13;
&#13;
and financed through UN auspices are any less desirable from a&#13;
&#13;
cost benefit point of view than the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:    No, I donâ&#128;&#153;t think that can be said, no.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Or the other way around?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:    No.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Why do you suppose both these organizations are in the same&#13;
&#13;
business?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:    Well, youâ&#128;&#153;ll have to go back to the meetings in 1946,&#13;
&#13;
wasnâ&#128;&#153;t it, when they had their Bretton Woods Conference.    It was&#13;
&#13;
decided at that time, and the actual procedures of course have&#13;
&#13;
grown with the years and their experience.    I worked for the&#13;
&#13;
United Nations three times, and I donâ&#128;&#153;t think it would be right&#13;
&#13;
to say that they conduct technical operations differently from&#13;
&#13;
us.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:    But the point of my questioning here is that itâ&#128;&#153;s sometimes&#13;
&#13;
said that the World Bank really finances all the useful projects&#13;
&#13;
that it can find, and that the only reason it hasnâ&#128;&#153;t made more&#13;
&#13;
loans than it has is because it hasnâ&#128;&#153;t been able to find more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 24 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                            General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
useful projects.   But this doesnâ&#128;&#153;t seem consistent, with the fact&#13;
&#13;
that the UN apparently finds some worthwhile projects to do.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   They do, and they find some of them with the help of&#13;
&#13;
the World Bank.    The World Bank helps them.   For instance, I went&#13;
&#13;
to the Suez Canal for the United Nations, and then a year later I&#13;
&#13;
went to the Suez Canal for the World Bank, for the widening and&#13;
&#13;
deepening of the Canal which resulted in a loan to the Suez Canal&#13;
&#13;
Authority.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What do you suppose determines, in the case of a borrowing&#13;
&#13;
country, whether it will approach the UN or the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   If theyâ&#128;&#153;re a member of the World Bank, of course, if&#13;
&#13;
theyâ&#128;&#153;re a subscriber to the World Bank, they would come to the&#13;
&#13;
World Bank.   And the United Nations channels development projects&#13;
&#13;
to the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   But the UN does finance some projects on its own, doesnâ&#128;&#153;t it?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Well, yes.   I donâ&#128;&#153;t know whether youâ&#128;&#153;d call them&#13;
&#13;
strictly definite projects.   They cover a greater area, and I see&#13;
&#13;
the point youâ&#128;&#153;re making, but I donâ&#128;&#153;t think that the United&#13;
&#13;
Nations organization and the World Bank are competitors at all&#13;
&#13;
for projects.   They supplement each other and complement each&#13;
&#13;
other.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 25 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                             General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   When you say supplement, do you mean that the UN finances&#13;
&#13;
different kinds of projects?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   The UN has a large fund for special projects of&#13;
&#13;
immediate urgency.   When any of them is a particular technical&#13;
&#13;
project, they call on the World Bank for engineers to help them.&#13;
&#13;
In fact, weâ&#128;&#153;ve had engineers temporarily assigned up there,&#13;
&#13;
working for them, sometimes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Iâ&#128;&#153;m still concerned about this matter of type of projects.&#13;
&#13;
Might it be, for example, that the World Bank would feel that it&#13;
&#13;
was not able to finance a public health project, for example, and&#13;
&#13;
the UN might decide that it could?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Well, now, I donâ&#128;&#153;t have anything to do with those&#13;
&#13;
decisions in the Bank, and I donâ&#128;&#153;t think Iâ&#128;&#153;m the proper one to&#13;
&#13;
ask about that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I just thought that you were one person who had been a&#13;
&#13;
consultant in both places.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Yes.   Yes, thatâ&#128;&#153;s true.   And from my experience, I&#13;
&#13;
havenâ&#128;&#153;t seen anything that I think should be transferred to the&#13;
&#13;
World Bank, or vice versa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 26 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                             General Raymond Wheeler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Are there any other matters that you think we might talk&#13;
&#13;
about?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wheeler:   Oh, I think not.   I donâ&#128;&#153;t feel very well prepared on&#13;
&#13;
this new line of questioning which I hadnâ&#128;&#153;t anticipated.    And&#13;
&#13;
another thing, you should have one of the engineers of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
who is working permanently in the permanent organization, which&#13;
&#13;
Iâ&#128;&#153;m not now.   I have just a special assignment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Thank you very much, General Wheeler.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            On July 14, 1961, General Raymond
            Wheeler was interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group
            Archives oral history program by Robert W. Oliver. During
            his tenure at the Bank from 1949 to 1956, he served as
            engineering advisor to the loan director (1949-1952,
            1953-1956) and as director for the technical operations
            department (1952-1953). Mr. Wheeler remained in relationship
            with the World Bank as an engineering consultant
            (1957-1969). His transcript concerns his service to the
            United States Army as lieutenant general, where he was chief
            of the Corps of Engineers, the Indus River project and
            Pakistan, the Mekong River project. Mr. Wheeler also
            discusses his work for the United Nations.
