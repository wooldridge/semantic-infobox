CIWA will be managed by the Water Resources Management Unit (AFTWR) in the World&#13;
Bank. AFTWR is responsible for the administration as well as managing the MDTF including&#13;
fiduciary risks.&#13;
Governance, Administration and Execution. The governance structure is designed to ensure a&#13;
participatory and flexible approach. The governance arrangements will comprise two main&#13;
structures:&#13;
CIWA Advisory Committee.      At least one annual meeting with the Advisory&#13;
Committee will be held and if needed, a semi-annual meeting will also be considered.&#13;
The Advisory Committee's role will be to guide strategy, review program&#13;
implementation, and monitor results, periodic meetings of consultative groups targeted on&#13;
specific river-basins might also be considered. The committee will comprise all trust&#13;
fund donors who wish to participate and the World Bank. The World Bank will provide&#13;
an annual progress report as a basis for discussion, drawing out key issues, concerns, and&#13;
action points. Non-MDTF contributing partners may also be invited to meetings to&#13;
broaden dialogue and maintain an inclusive approach. The Committee will be both&#13;
consultative and advisory and will include: (i) provision of a forum for CIWA countries&#13;
and development partners to meet, exchange information, and consult on a regular basis&#13;
(e.g. at least one major meeting a year either in Sub-Saharan Africa or in a donor host&#13;
country); (ii) review and discuss progress reports and implementation of trust fund-&#13;
financed programs; and (iii) review of CIWA funding needs and promotion of the&#13;
participation of new donors to close funding gaps and support new program components.&#13;
The CIWA Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the operation of the trust&#13;
fund. It will provide oversight and ensure that the use of its resources meet the objectives&#13;
of the CIWA program. The CIWA Advisory Committee meeting will advise on&#13;
appropriate action to promote the participation of new partners and additional funding to&#13;
close gaps and support new program components. Members of the CIWA Advisory&#13;
Committee will include a representative of the World Bank and a representative of each&#13;
partner contributing to the CIWA MDTF, such as multilateral and bilateral institutions,&#13;
non-governmental organizations and foundations, provided that they had signed an&#13;
administrative  agreement/arrangement,  or  a    series  of    administrative&#13;
agreements/arrangements, with the World Bank for the CIWA MDTF ("the CIWA&#13;
MDTF agreement") with a minimum contribution of USD 500,000.&#13;
*     Trust Fund Core Team. A dedicated Trust Fund Core Team will be responsible for the&#13;
day-to-day administration of the MDTF comprising initially a TTL of the MDTF and an&#13;
Operations Analyst appointed by AFTWR. While the Trust Fund Core Team will consult&#13;
the Advisory Committee for strategic guidance and advice, the trust fund management&#13;
decisions will be the responsibility of a TTL of the MDTF, with oversight and guidance&#13;
from World Bank Management (Sector Manager, Director, etc). They will be responsible&#13;
for: (a) coordinating the allocation of resources to selected activities and projects; (b)&#13;
approval of proposals; (c) providing updates on the implementation progress; (d)&#13;
monitoring outputs and expenditures; (e) quality assurance; (f) overall fiduciary&#13;
management; (g) any other related administrative responsibilities, including issuing the&#13;

peer review of proposals that will provide recommendations to the CIWA Trust Fund&#13;
Core Team on proposals. The core team will be expanded if needed as the CIWA&#13;
program evolves.&#13;
