facility &#13;
surveys &#13;
every &#13;
six months &#13;
and &#13;
on &#13;
the results &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
follow-on &#13;
household &#13;
surveys. &#13;
The &#13;
NGO &#13;
will &#13;
receive regular &#13;
payments &#13;
based &#13;
on &#13;
satisfactory progress &#13;
as &#13;
judged &#13;
by &#13;

field &#13;
supervision &#13;
carried &#13;
out &#13;
by &#13;
MOH &#13;

third &#13;
party. &#13;
Monitoring &#13;
and &#13;
evaluation &#13;
of &#13;

will &#13;
be &#13;
carried out &#13;

Among &#13;
the &#13;
outcomes &#13;
of &#13;

is &#13;
whether &#13;
the &#13;
services &#13;
provided &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;

are &#13;
perceived &#13;
to &#13;
be &#13;

of &#13;
the &#13;
Government&#146;s &#13;
efforts. &#13;
The &#13;
payment &#13;
of &#13;

MOH-SM: &#13;
In &#13;
the &#13;
three &#13;
provinces &#13;
selected &#13;
for &#13;
this &#13;
approach, &#13;
the &#13;
aim &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
to &#13;
allow &#13;
MOH &#13;
staff &#13;
to &#13;
expand &#13;
the &#13;
health &#13;
services &#13;
in &#13;
a phased manner. &#13;
Increasing amount &#13;
of &#13;
resources &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
provided &#13;
to &#13;
the selected &#13;
provinces &#13;
based &#13;
on &#13;
their &#13;
demonstrated &#13;
capacity &#13;
to &#13;
use resources &#13;
effectively &#13;
and &#13;
maintain proper &#13;
accounts. &#13;
Similar &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
PPA &#13;
approach, &#13;
the &#13;
MOH &#13;
will &#13;
use &#13;
the &#13;
provision &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
BPHS &#13;
as &#13;
its &#13;
primary &#13;
goal &#13;
in &#13;
these &#13;
provinces and &#13;
use &#13;
already &#13;
selected &#13;
indicators &#13;
to judge &#13;
success. &#13;
In &#13;
addition, &#13;
(i) &#13;
the &#13;
MOH &#13;
intends &#13;
to &#13;
empower &#13;
provincial &#13;
health &#13;
directors &#13;
and &#13;
their &#13;
staff &#13;
to &#13;
develop &#13;
an &#13;
annual &#13;
plan &#13;
and &#13;
budget &#13;
with &#13;
monthly &#13;
work &#13;
plans &#13;
after &#13;
receiving training &#13;
on &#13;
planning &#13;
and budgeting. &#13;
A &#13;

Coordinating &#13;
Mechanisms &#13;
at &#13;

The &#13;
intention behind &#13;
the &#13;
PPAs &#13;
and &#13;
MOH- &#13;
SM &#13;
is &#13;
not &#13;
to &#13;
displace &#13;
any &#13;
existing &#13;
efforts &#13;
but &#13;
rather &#13;
to &#13;
expand &#13;
and &#13;
consolidate &#13;
service &#13;
delivery. &#13;
To &#13;
help &#13;
ensure &#13;
careful  coordination &#13;
among &#13;
service &#13;
providers, &#13;
the &#13;
following &#13;
strategies &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
employed: &#13;
(i) &#13;
a &#13;
provincial &#13;
coordination &#13;
committee &#13;
(PCC) &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
established &#13;
chaired &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
provincial &#13;
health &#13;
director &#13;
(PHD) &#13;
and &#13;
comprising &#13;
the &#13;
PPA &#13;
winning &#13;

and  other &#13;
NGOs &#13;
operating &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
province; &#13;
(ii) &#13;
in &#13;
PPA &#13;
provinces &#13;
the &#13;
PHD &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
assisted &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
PPA &#13;
NGO &#13;
in &#13;
coordinating &#13;
ongoing &#13;
activities; &#13;
(iii) &#13;
NGOs &#13;
bidding &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
PPAs &#13;
will &#13;
have &#13;
to &#13;
indicate &#13;
in &#13;
their &#13;
technical &#13;
proposals &#13;
how &#13;
they &#13;
will &#13;
work &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
Provincial &#13;
Health &#13;
Department &#13;
and &#13;
NGOs &#13;
already &#13;
on &#13;
the &#13;
ground &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
particular province; &#13;
(iv) &#13;
NGOs &#13;
already &#13;
active &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
province &#13;
where &#13;
they &#13;
are &#13;
bidding &#13;
will &#13;
receive additional &#13;
points &#13;
on &#13;
their &#13;
technical &#13;
score; &#13;
(v) &#13;
NGOs &#13;
coming &#13;
into &#13;
the &#13;
province &#13;
after &#13;
the &#13;
PPA or &#13;
MOH-SM &#13;
is &#13;
in &#13;
place &#13;
will &#13;
only &#13;
be &#13;
able &#13;
to &#13;
do &#13;
so &#13;
with &#13;
agreement &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
PCC &#13;
and &#13;
GCMU; &#13;
(vi) &#13;
a &#13;
simple &#13;
system &#13;
of &#13;
mediation &#13;
(comprising &#13;
one representative &#13;
each &#13;
from &#13;
the &#13;
central &#13;
MOH &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
NGO &#13;

and &#13;

(comprising &#13;
central &#13;

of &#13;
the &#13;
NGO &#13;
community &#13;
and donor &#13;
and &#13;
UN &#13;
agencies) &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
implemented; &#13;
and &#13;
(vii) &#13;
the &#13;
PPA &#13;
NGOs &#13;
or &#13;
Provincial &#13;
MOH &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
allowed &#13;
to &#13;
support &#13;
the &#13;
work &#13;
of &#13;
other &#13;
NGOs &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
province &#13;
if &#13;
they  obtain  permission &#13;
from &#13;
the &#13;
central &#13;
MOH. &#13;
The &#13;
NGO &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
PPA &#13;
and  the &#13;
provincial &#13;
MOH &#13;
will &#13;
have &#13;
an &#13;
interest &#13;
in &#13;
ensuring that progress &#13;
is &#13;
made &#13;
on &#13;
the core &#13;
output indicators &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
other &#13;
NGOs &#13;
will &#13;
presumably &#13;
be &#13;
interested &#13;
in &#13;
obtaining &#13;
additional &#13;
resources &#13;
to &#13;
support &#13;
their &#13;
work. &#13;

about &#13;
500 &#13;
health facilities over &#13;
the &#13;

three &#13;
years, &#13;
although &#13;
it &#13;

not &#13;
provide &#13;
equipment &#13;
or &#13;
furniture &#13;
for &#13;
these &#13;
facilities. &#13;
Hence, &#13;
project &#13;
funds &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
used &#13;
to &#13;
provide &#13;
basic &#13;
equipment and &#13;
furniture &#13;
for &#13;
CHCs &#13;
and &#13;
BHCs &#13;
based &#13;
on &#13;
lists &#13;
developed &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
MOH. &#13;
The &#13;
equipment &#13;
provided &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
simple &#13;
with &#13;
few &#13;
moving &#13;
parts &#13;
so &#13;
that maintenance &#13;
and repair can &#13;
be &#13;
done &#13;
locally. &#13;
The &#13;
project &#13;
will &#13;
also &#13;
finance &#13;
basic &#13;
surgical &#13;
equipment &#13;
for &#13;
district &#13;
and &#13;
provincial &#13;
hospitals &#13;
not &#13;
being &#13;
provided &#13;
equipment &#13;
by &#13;
other &#13;
agencies. &#13;
The &#13;
list &#13;
of &#13;
hospital &#13;
equipment &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
developed &#13;
by &#13;
MOH &#13;
in &#13;
consultation &#13;
with &#13;
experts, &#13;
including &#13;
the &#13;
International Committee &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
Read &#13;
Cross  (ICRC), &#13;
within &#13;
a &#13;
budget  envelope &#13;
of &#13;
about &#13;
US$20,000 &#13;
per &#13;
hospital. &#13;
Most &#13;
of &#13;
this &#13;
equipment &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
surgical &#13;
instruments &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
like &#13;
that &#13;
requires &#13;
limited &#13;
maintenance. &#13;

is &#13;
the prevention &#13;

may &#13;
be &#13;
helpful &#13;
in &#13;

but &#13;
will &#13;
have &#13;
no &#13;
effect &#13;
on &#13;
preventing &#13;
diarrhea &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;

Improving &#13;
the &#13;
quality &#13;
of &#13;
drinking &#13;
water &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
important &#13;
but &#13;
it &#13;
will &#13;
take &#13;
time &#13;
and &#13;
considerable &#13;
resources &#13;
to &#13;
ensure &#13;
most &#13;
households &#13;
in &#13;
rural &#13;
areas &#13;
have &#13;
access &#13;
to &#13;
safe &#13;
drinking &#13;
water. &#13;
Data &#13;
collected &#13;
from &#13;
various &#13;
sources &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
Centers &#13;
for &#13;
Disease &#13;
Control &#13;
and &#13;
Prevention &#13;
(CDC) &#13;
indicates that &#13;
less &#13;
than &#13;
5 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
rural &#13;
households  have &#13;
access &#13;
to &#13;
improved &#13;
water &#13;
supplies. &#13;
Hence, &#13;
it &#13;
makes &#13;
sense &#13;
to &#13;
test &#13;
appropriate &#13;
technologies &#13;
for &#13;
safely treating &#13;
and &#13;
storing &#13;
drinking &#13;
water. &#13;
CDC &#13;
experts &#13;
have &#13;
developed &#13;
a &#13;
&#147;safe &#13;
water &#13;
system&#148; &#13;
(SWS) &#13;
that &#13;
uses &#13;
dilute &#13;
sodium hypo-chlorite solution &#13;
to &#13;
disinfect &#13;
drinking &#13;
water &#13;
that &#13;
can &#13;
then &#13;
be &#13;
stored &#13;
in &#13;
specially &#13;
designed &#13;
narrow-necked &#13;
containers &#13;
that &#13;
prevent &#13;
re-contamination. &#13;
The &#13;
storage &#13;
containers &#13;
also &#13;
have &#13;
a &#13;
spigot &#13;
and &#13;
built-in &#13;
soap &#13;
dish &#13;
that &#13;
facilitates &#13;
hand &#13;
washing. &#13;
Recent evaluations &#13;
in &#13;
other countries have &#13;
shown &#13;
that &#13;
the &#13;
SWS &#13;
approach &#13;
can &#13;
reduce &#13;
the incidence &#13;
of &#13;
diarrhea &#13;
by &#13;
44 &#13;
percent &#13;
to &#13;
85 &#13;
percent. &#13;
It &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
important &#13;
to &#13;
see &#13;
whether &#13;
similar &#13;
results can &#13;
be &#13;
obtained &#13;
under &#13;
field &#13;
conditions &#13;
in &#13;
Afghanistan. &#13;
9. &#13;
To &#13;
test &#13;
this &#13;
approach, &#13;
experts &#13;
from &#13;
CDC &#13;
will &#13;
work &#13;
closely &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
MOH, &#13;
to &#13;
carry out &#13;
a &#13;
field &#13;
trial &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
efficacy &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
SWS &#13;
in &#13;
Afghanistan, &#13;
particularly &#13;
in &#13;
comparison &#13;
to &#13;
simply &#13;
improving &#13;
the &#13;
water &#13;
supply. &#13;
Forty-five &#13;
villages &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
randomly &#13;
allocated &#13;
to &#13;
one &#13;
of &#13;
three &#13;
interventions: &#13;
(i) &#13;
the &#13;
SWS &#13;
without &#13;
improvement &#13;
in &#13;
water &#13;
supply; &#13;
(ii) &#13;
improvements &#13;
in &#13;
water &#13;
supply &#13;
without &#13;
the &#13;
SWS; &#13;
and &#13;
(iii) &#13;
a &#13;
combination &#13;
of &#13;
both &#13;
improved &#13;
water &#13;
supply &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
SWS. &#13;
This &#13;
study &#13;
will &#13;
provide information &#13;
on how &#13;
improving &#13;
water &#13;
supplies, &#13;
which &#13;
is &#13;
expensive &#13;
and &#13;
may &#13;
not &#13;
happen &#13;
in &#13;
much &#13;
of &#13;
Afghanistan &#13;
for &#13;
many &#13;
years, &#13;
compares &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
SWS. &#13;
The &#13;
study &#13;
design &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
reviewed &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
MOH &#13;
and &#13;
a &#13;
CDC &#13;
ethics &#13;
review &#13;
committee. &#13;
In &#13;
addition, &#13;
all &#13;
the &#13;
SWS &#13;
villages &#13;
will &#13;
receive &#13;
improved &#13;
water &#13;
supplies &#13;
after the &#13;
study &#13;
was &#13;
completed. &#13;
During &#13;
the &#13;
efficacy &#13;
study &#13;
the &#13;
disinfectant &#13;
and &#13;
special  container &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
provided &#13;
for &#13;
free, &#13;
however, &#13;
PPA &#13;
NGOs &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
encouraged &#13;
to &#13;
implement &#13;
the &#13;
SWS &#13;
on &#13;
a &#13;
pilot &#13;
basis &#13;
to &#13;
observe &#13;
what &#13;
happens &#13;
to &#13;
use &#13;
when &#13;
subsidies &#13;
are &#13;
reduced. &#13;
If &#13;
the &#13;
efficacy &#13;
trial &#13;
is &#13;
successful &#13;
project &#13;
funds &#13;
and &#13;
funds &#13;
from &#13;
other &#13;
donors &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
used &#13;
to &#13;
support &#13;
the &#13;
social &#13;
marketing &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
sodium hypo-chlorite solution &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
storage &#13;
containers. &#13;

Innovations. &#13;
To &#13;
ensure &#13;
the &#13;
sustainability &#13;
of &#13;
public &#13;
health &#13;
activities,  mechanisms &#13;
will &#13;
have &#13;
to &#13;
be &#13;
found &#13;
to &#13;
generate &#13;
funds &#13;
from &#13;
local &#13;
sources. &#13;
Experience &#13;
in &#13;
other countries indicates &#13;
that &#13;
community-based &#13;
health &#13;
insurance &#13;
is &#13;
difficult &#13;
to &#13;
manage &#13;
and &#13;
has &#13;
often &#13;
not &#13;
been &#13;
successful. &#13;
User &#13;
charges &#13;
also &#13;
have &#13;
a &#13;
mixed &#13;
track &#13;
record &#13;
although, &#13;
they have often been &#13;
efficient &#13;
and &#13;
equitable &#13;
when &#13;
implemented &#13;
by &#13;
NGOs. &#13;
Another &#13;
mechanism that &#13;
has &#13;
rarely &#13;
been &#13;
used &#13;
but &#13;
has &#13;
been &#13;
quite &#13;
successful &#13;
is &#13;
a &#13;
&#147;community  health &#13;
contribution.&#148; &#13;
Local &#13;
community &#13;
leaders agree &#13;
on &#13;
and &#13;
collect &#13;
a &#13;
health contribution &#13;
from &#13;
households &#13;
in &#13;
their &#13;
own &#13;
communities &#13;
soon &#13;
after &#13;
the &#13;
harvest &#13;
when &#13;
households have &#13;
cash. &#13;
Households that &#13;
are &#13;
judged &#13;
too &#13;
poor &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
exempted &#13;
from &#13;
the &#13;
contribution &#13;
and &#13;
wealthy &#13;
households &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
expected &#13;
to &#13;
contribute more. &#13;
In &#13;
Niger, &#13;
introduction &#13;
of &#13;
10 &#13;
Page  17&#13;
a &#13;
similar health contribution &#13;
resulted &#13;
in &#13;
a &#13;
doubling &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
use &#13;
of &#13;
services &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
poorest &#13;
25 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
population. &#13;
There &#13;
is &#13;
little &#13;
experience &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
latter &#13;
approach &#13;
in &#13;
Afghanistan &#13;
and &#13;
so &#13;
it &#13;
is &#13;
important &#13;
to &#13;
pilot &#13;
test &#13;
this &#13;
approach &#13;
against &#13;
alternatives. &#13;
11. &#13;
In &#13;
order &#13;
to &#13;
provide &#13;
the &#13;
MOH &#13;
with &#13;
credible &#13;
data &#13;
on &#13;
how &#13;
various &#13;
alternatives &#13;
work, &#13;
a &#13;
study &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
undertaken &#13;
in &#13;
which &#13;
six &#13;
BHCs &#13;
in &#13;
each &#13;
PPA &#13;
province &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
allocated &#13;
to &#13;
one &#13;
of &#13;
three &#13;
groups: &#13;
(i) &#13;
user &#13;

(ii) &#13;

(iii) &#13;

@e., &#13;
neither &#13;
user &#13;
charges &#13;
nor  community &#13;
health &#13;
contributions). &#13;
The &#13;
study &#13;
will &#13;
examine &#13;
the  effects &#13;
of &#13;
these &#13;
approaches &#13;
on &#13;
beneficiaries, &#13;
particularly &#13;
the &#13;

and &#13;
the &#13;

that &#13;
other &#13;
public &#13;
health &#13;

are &#13;
carried out &#13;
effectively &#13;
will &#13;
require &#13;
that the capacity &#13;

the &#13;
MOH, &#13;
particularly &#13;
at &#13;
central &#13;
and &#13;
provincial &#13;
levels, &#13;
will &#13;
need &#13;
to &#13;
be &#13;

To &#13;
accomplish &#13;
this &#13;
capacity &#13;
building &#13;
and &#13;
training &#13;
, &#13;
the &#13;
project &#13;
will: &#13;
(i) &#13;
strengthen &#13;
the &#13;

regional, and &#13;
central &#13;
offices &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
MOH; &#13;
(ii) &#13;
provide &#13;
ongoing &#13;

to &#13;
the &#13;

13. &#13;
Strengthening Communications. &#13;
Regardless &#13;
of &#13;
their &#13;
ultimate &#13;
role,  the &#13;
provincial &#13;
health &#13;
offices &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
MOH &#13;
need &#13;
to &#13;
be &#13;
significantly &#13;
strengthened. &#13;
Currently &#13;
they &#13;
have &#13;
limited &#13;
contact &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
MOH, &#13;
the managers &#13;
have &#13;
limited &#13;
experience &#13;
or &#13;
knowledge &#13;
of &#13;
management &#13;

supervision, &#13;
and &#13;
they &#13;
lack &#13;
the &#13;
resources &#13;
to &#13;
oversee &#13;
their &#13;
jurisdictions. &#13;
In &#13;
order &#13;
to &#13;
address these &#13;
weaknesses, &#13;
the &#13;
project &#13;
will &#13;
provide &#13;
the &#13;
following: &#13;
(i) &#13;
high &#13;

and  computers &#13;
powered &#13;
by &#13;
solar &#13;

communications &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
provided &#13;
to &#13;
all &#13;
the &#13;
provincial &#13;

Regardless &#13;
of &#13;
future telecommunications &#13;
plans &#13;
such &#13;
a &#13;
data &#13;
radio &#13;

would: &#13;
(a) &#13;
be &#13;
of &#13;
critical &#13;
importance &#13;
during &#13;
natural &#13;
or &#13;
man-made &#13;

(b) &#13;
facilitate &#13;
communications  between &#13;
the &#13;
central, &#13;
regional, &#13;
and &#13;
MOH &#13;
offices &#13;
which &#13;

will &#13;
also create &#13;
an &#13;

mostly take the &#13;
form &#13;
of &#13;
reductions &#13;
in &#13;
under-5 and &#13;

morbidity, &#13;
since &#13;
the &#13;

Under &#13;

it &#13;
was &#13;
estimated that &#13;

about &#13;

Of &#13;
these &#13;
deaths, &#13;
about &#13;
1,500 &#13;
deaths &#13;
of &#13;
women &#13;
of &#13;
reproductive &#13;
age &#13;
and &#13;
27,000  deaths &#13;

will &#13;
be &#13;
averted &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
third &#13;

are &#13;
sustained &#13;
(with &#13;
the &#13;
same &#13;
degree &#13;
of &#13;
coverage &#13;
and &#13;
effectiveness), &#13;
it &#13;
could &#13;
be &#13;
expected &#13;
that every &#13;
year &#13;
a &#13;
number &#13;
of &#13;
additional &#13;
deaths &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
averted &#13;
of &#13;
a &#13;
magnitude &#13;
similar &#13;

This &#13;
section &#13;
briefly &#13;
describes &#13;
the &#13;
experience &#13;
in &#13;
other post-conflict, &#13;
low &#13;
income &#13;
settings, &#13;
of &#13;
contracting &#13;
with &#13;
NGOs &#13;
for &#13;
delivering &#13;
primary &#13;
health &#13;
care &#13;
services. &#13;
The &#13;
results &#13;
of &#13;
evaluations &#13;
in &#13;
Cambodia,  Guatemala, &#13;
and &#13;
Haiti, &#13;
are &#13;
presented. &#13;
In &#13;
addition,  the &#13;
results &#13;
from &#13;
nutrition &#13;
projects &#13;
in &#13;
Senegal &#13;
and &#13;
Madagascar &#13;
which &#13;
also &#13;
used &#13;
contracting &#13;
with &#13;
NGOs &#13;
are &#13;
also &#13;
discussed. &#13;
32. &#13;
Cambodia. &#13;
Many &#13;
years &#13;
of &#13;
war &#13;
and &#13;
political &#13;
upheaval &#13;
left &#13;
Cambodia &#13;
with &#13;
a &#13;
limited &#13;
health &#13;
infrastructure, &#13;
particularly &#13;
in &#13;
rural &#13;
areas. &#13;
Health &#13;
worker morale &#13;
was &#13;
poor, &#13;
management &#13;
capacity &#13;
at &#13;
the &#13;
district &#13;
level &#13;
was &#13;
very &#13;
weak, &#13;
and &#13;
access &#13;
to &#13;
service was &#13;
inadequate. &#13;
A &#13;
1998 demographic &#13;
and &#13;
health &#13;
survey &#13;
found &#13;
that, &#13;
nation-wide, &#13;
only &#13;
39 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
children &#13;
were &#13;
fully &#13;
immunized. &#13;
To &#13;
address &#13;
these &#13;
serious &#13;
issues, &#13;
the &#13;
MOH &#13;
devised &#13;
a  &#147;coverage &#13;
plan&#148; &#13;
which &#13;
included: &#13;
(i) &#13;
the &#13;
17 &#13;
Page  24&#13;
construction &#13;
or &#13;
rehabilitation &#13;
of &#13;
health &#13;
centers; &#13;
(ii) &#13;
merging &#13;
smaller &#13;
administrative districts &#13;
into &#13;
&#147;operational  districts&#148; &#13;
with &#13;
a &#13;
population &#13;
of &#13;
about &#13;
150,000; &#13;
and &#13;
(iii) &#13;
developing &#13;
a &#13;
minimum &#13;
package &#13;
of &#13;
activities &#13;
(MPA) &#13;
to &#13;
be &#13;
carried &#13;
out &#13;
at &#13;
health &#13;
center &#13;
and &#13;
comprising &#13;
basic &#13;
preventive &#13;
and &#13;
curative &#13;
services &#13;
such &#13;
as &#13;
immunization, &#13;
family &#13;
planning, &#13;
antenatal &#13;
care, &#13;
and &#13;
provision &#13;
of &#13;
micronutrients. &#13;
33. &#13;
three &#13;
approaches &#13;
to &#13;
improving &#13;
service &#13;
delivery: &#13;
Approaches Used: &#13;
Using &#13;
loan &#13;
funds &#13;
from &#13;
the &#13;
Asian &#13;
Development Bank, &#13;
the &#13;
MOH &#13;
tested &#13;
(i) &#13;
Contracting &#13;
Out (CO) &#13;
in &#13;
which &#13;
the contractors &#13;
had &#13;
complete &#13;
line &#13;
responsibility &#13;
for &#13;
service &#13;
delivery, &#13;
including &#13;
hiring, &#13;
firing &#13;
and setting &#13;
wages, &#13;
procuring &#13;
and &#13;
distributing &#13;
essential drugs &#13;
and &#13;
supplies, &#13;
organizing and &#13;
staffing health &#13;
facilities. &#13;
(ii) &#13;
Contracting &#13;
In &#13;
(CI) &#13;
in &#13;
which &#13;
the contractors &#13;
worked &#13;
within &#13;
the &#13;
MOH &#13;
system &#13;
and &#13;
had &#13;
to &#13;
strengthen &#13;
the &#13;
existing &#13;
district &#13;
structure. &#13;
The &#13;
contractors &#13;
could &#13;
not hire &#13;
or &#13;
fire &#13;
staff, &#13;
although &#13;
they &#13;
could &#13;
request &#13;
their &#13;
transfer. &#13;
Drugs &#13;
and &#13;
supplies &#13;
were &#13;
provided to &#13;
the &#13;
district &#13;
through &#13;
the &#13;
normal &#13;
MOH &#13;
channels. &#13;
The &#13;
contractor &#13;
received &#13;
a &#13;
budget &#13;
supplement &#13;
of &#13;
US$0.25 &#13;
per &#13;
capita &#13;
per &#13;
year &#13;
to &#13;
spend &#13;

staff, &#13;
operating &#13;
expenses, etc. &#13;

which &#13;
the &#13;
management &#13;
of &#13;

in &#13;
the &#13;
hands &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
District &#13;
Health &#13;
Management &#13;

34. &#13;
Evaluation &#13;
Methodology. &#13;
Twelve &#13;
districts were &#13;
randomly &#13;
assigned &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
three &#13;
different &#13;
approaches &#13;
and &#13;
baseline &#13;
household &#13;
and &#13;
health &#13;
facility &#13;
surveys &#13;
were  carried &#13;
out &#13;
in &#13;
late &#13;
1997. &#13;
Contracts &#13;
were &#13;
signed &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
NGOs &#13;
in &#13;
December &#13;
1998 &#13;
and &#13;
follow-on &#13;
surveys &#13;
were carried out &#13;
in &#13;
August &#13;
2001, &#13;
about &#13;
2.5 years &#13;
after &#13;
implementation &#13;
began. &#13;
The &#13;
surveys &#13;
were carried &#13;
out &#13;
by &#13;
a &#13;
third &#13;
party &#13;
and &#13;
data &#13;
was &#13;
collected &#13;
on &#13;
the &#13;
parameters &#13;
stipulated &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
contract. &#13;
Households were &#13;
divided &#13;
into &#13;
&#147;poor&#148; &#13;
or &#13;
&#147;not &#13;
poor&#148; &#13;
based &#13;
on &#13;
observable &#13;
assets. &#13;
35. &#13;
Results. &#13;
As &#13;
can &#13;
be &#13;
seen &#13;
in &#13;
Figure &#13;
1, &#13;
the &#13;
districts were &#13;
very &#13;
similar &#13;
at &#13;
baseline &#13;
but &#13;
after &#13;
2.5 &#13;
years &#13;
of &#13;
implementation &#13;
the &#13;
CO &#13;
districts were &#13;
providing many &#13;
more &#13;
services &#13;
than &#13;
the &#13;
CI &#13;
districts &#13;
which &#13;
were &#13;
providing &#13;
significantly &#13;
more &#13;
services &#13;
than &#13;
the &#13;
Government &#13;
was &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
control &#13;
districts. &#13;
This &#13;
pattern &#13;
held for &#13;
all &#13;
the &#13;
indicators &#13;
stipulated &#13;
in &#13;
the contracts &#13;
(see &#13;
Figure &#13;
2). &#13;
The &#13;
cost &#13;
of &#13;
CO &#13;
was &#13;
about &#13;
US$4.50 &#13;
per &#13;
capita &#13;
per &#13;
year &#13;
to &#13;
the  Government, &#13;
however &#13;
people &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
community &#13;
were &#13;
paying &#13;
significantly &#13;
less &#13;
out &#13;
of &#13;
their &#13;
own &#13;
pockets &#13;
(see &#13;
Figure &#13;
3). &#13;
The &#13;
difference &#13;
in &#13;
cost &#13;
between &#13;
the &#13;
CI &#13;
and &#13;
control &#13;
districts &#13;
in &#13;
cost was &#13;
the &#13;
price &#13;
of &#13;
the management contracts &#13;

the &#13;
NGOs. &#13;

As &#13;
part &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
agreement &#13;
ending &#13;
many &#13;
years &#13;
of &#13;
civil &#13;
war, &#13;
the &#13;
Government &#13;
of &#13;
Guatemala &#13;
was &#13;
obliged &#13;
to &#13;
improve &#13;
the &#13;
delivery &#13;
of &#13;
services &#13;
to &#13;
the indigenous people &#13;
who &#13;
make &#13;
up &#13;
about &#13;
50 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
population. &#13;
The &#13;
indigenous &#13;

To &#13;
improve &#13;
the &#13;
delivery &#13;
of &#13;
primary &#13;
health &#13;
care, &#13;
the &#13;
Government &#13;
tried &#13;
three &#13;
approaches: &#13;
(i) &#13;
in &#13;
remote &#13;
areas &#13;
it &#13;
contracted &#13;
out &#13;
service &#13;
delivery &#13;
to &#13;
NGOs &#13;
(this &#13;
was &#13;
called &#13;
the &#147;direct &#13;
method&#148; &#13;
and &#13;
resembles &#13;
&#147;contracting &#13;
out&#148;); &#13;
(ii) &#13;
in &#13;
less &#13;
remote &#13;
areas &#13;
it &#13;
gave &#13;
NGOs &#13;
contracts &#13;
to &#13;
manage &#13;
existing health facilities &#13;
(this &#13;
was &#13;
called &#13;
the &#13;
&#147;mixed&#148;  approach &#13;
and &#13;
was &#13;
similar &#13;

and &#13;
(iii) &#13;
also &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
less &#13;
remote &#13;
areas, &#13;
it &#13;
allowed &#13;
Government &#13;
officials &#13;
to &#13;
manage some &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
facilities &#13;
(this &#13;
was &#13;
called &#13;
the &#13;
&#147;traditional&#148; &#13;
approach &#13;
and &#13;
resembled &#13;
the &#13;
&#147;control&#148; &#13;
group &#13;
in &#13;
Cambodia). &#13;
37. &#13;
Evaluation &#13;
Methodology. &#13;
There &#13;
was &#13;
no &#13;
baseline data &#13;
available &#13;
in &#13;
Guatemala, &#13;
however &#13;
three &#13;
years &#13;
after &#13;
the contracting &#13;
process &#13;
began, &#13;
household &#13;
surveys &#13;
were carried &#13;
out &#13;
in &#13;
randomly &#13;
selected &#13;
areas &#13;
implementing &#13;
the &#13;
three &#13;
different &#13;
approaches. &#13;
Unfortunately, &#13;
the &#13;
areas &#13;
implementing &#13;
the &#147;direct&#148; &#13;
approach &#13;
appear &#13;
to &#13;
have &#13;
been &#13;
more &#13;
isolated and &#13;
had &#13;
less &#13;

It &#13;
appears &#13;
that  the &#13;
&#147;mixed&#148; &#13;
approach &#13;
performed &#13;
better  than &#13;
the &#13;
Government &#13;
providing &#13;

itself &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
less &#13;
remote &#13;
areas &#13;
where &#13;
these &#13;
two &#13;
approaches &#13;
were implemented. &#13;
It &#13;
is &#13;
not &#13;
clear &#13;
whether &#13;
the &#13;
&#147;direct&#148;  approach &#13;
worked &#13;
well &#13;
or &#13;
not &#13;

were &#13;
more &#13;
remote. &#13;

USAlD &#13;
had &#13;
been &#13;
supporting &#13;
NGOs &#13;
in &#13;
Haiti &#13;
to &#13;
provide &#13;
health &#13;
services &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
country- &#13;
side, &#13;
because &#13;
Government &#13;
service &#13;
delivery post-conflict &#13;
had &#13;
nearly &#13;
ceased. &#13;
However, &#13;
USAID &#13;
was &#13;
somewhat &#13;
disappointed &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
performance &#13;
of &#13;
these &#13;
NGOs &#13;
who &#13;
were &#13;
paid &#13;
on &#13;
the &#13;
basis &#13;
of &#13;

In &#13;
an &#13;
attempt &#13;
to improve &#13;
performance, &#13;
it &#13;
offered &#13;
NGOs &#13;
a chance &#13;
to &#13;
receive &#13;
95 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
their &#13;
contract &#13;

in &#13;
exchange &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
opportunity &#13;
to &#13;
receive performance &#13;

worth &#13;
10 &#13;

if &#13;
they &#13;
achieved &#13;
specific &#13;

from &#13;
Table &#13;

all &#13;
three &#13;
NGOs &#13;
made &#13;
truly &#13;
remarkable &#13;

in &#13;
improving &#13;

However, &#13;
for &#13;

is &#13;
mixed. &#13;
On &#13;

NGOs &#13;
to &#13;
provide &#13;
nutrition &#13;
services &#13;
for &#13;
women &#13;
and &#13;
children. &#13;
The &#13;
services &#13;
included: &#13;
(i) &#13;
monthly growth monitoring for &#13;
children; &#13;
(ii) &#13;
weekly &#13;

Results. &#13;
There  were  non-project &#13;

communities. &#13;
However, &#13;
these &#13;
neighborhoods &#13;
were &#13;
&#147;contaminated&#148; &#13;
by &#13;
large &#13;
proportion &#13;
of &#13;
children &#13;
who &#13;
participated &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
program. &#13;

after &#13;
surveys &#13;
in &#13;
one &#13;

found &#13;
that &#13;
severe &#13;
malnutrition &#13;
declined &#13;
from &#13;
6 &#13;
percent &#13;
to &#13;
0 &#13;

to &#13;
24 &#13;
percent &#13;
in &#13;
17 &#13;
months. &#13;
The &#13;
study &#13;
also &#13;
found &#13;
that &#13;
there was a &#13;
large &#13;
reduction &#13;
in &#13;
malnutrition &#13;
rates &#13;
among &#13;
cohorts &#13;
of &#13;

ect &#13;
participants. &#13;
43. &#13;
Conclusions &#13;
from &#13;
the &#13;
Literature. &#13;
From &#13;
the &#13;
available &#13;
studies &#13;
it &#13;
appears &#13;
that &#13;
contracting &#13;
with &#13;
NGOs to &#13;
deliver &#13;
health &#13;
or &#13;
nutrition &#13;
services &#13;
is &#13;
effective &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
improvements &#13;
can &#13;
be &#13;
achieved &#13;
rapidly. &#13;
However, &#13;
there &#13;
are &#13;
methodological &#13;
concerns &#13;
with &#13;
all &#13;
the &#13;
studies: &#13;
(i) &#13;
the  evaluation &#13;
in &#13;
Guatemala &#13;
suffered &#13;
from &#13;
a &#13;
lack &#13;
of &#13;
baseline &#13;
data &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
likelihood &#13;
that &#13;
the &#13;
most &#13;
difficult &#13;
communities &#13;
were  contracted &#13;
out; &#13;
(ii) &#13;
the &#13;
study &#13;
in &#13;
Haiti &#13;
from &#13;
a &#13;
likely &#13;
volunteer &#13;
bias &#13;
among &#13;
the &#13;
NGOs &#13;
and &#13;
a &#13;
lack &#13;
of &#13;
control &#13;
areas; &#13;
and &#13;
(iii) &#13;
the &#13;
study &#13;
in &#13;
Madagascar &#13;
and &#13;
Senegal &#13;
from &#13;
the &#13;
lack &#13;
of &#13;
an &#13;
uncontaminated &#13;
control &#13;
group. &#13;
Only &#13;
the &#13;
study &#13;
in &#13;
Cambodia &#13;
rigorously &#13;
compared &#13;
NGO &#13;
provision &#13;
of &#13;
services &#13;
to &#13;
government &#13;
provision &#13;
and &#13;
found &#13;
that &#13;
NGOs &#13;
performed &#13;
better &#13;
in &#13;
terms &#13;
of &#13;
effectiveness, &#13;
efficiency, &#13;
and &#13;
equity.  Based &#13;
on &#13;
the &#13;
available information, &#13;
it &#13;
appears &#13;
likely &#13;
that &#13;
contracting &#13;
with &#13;
NGOs &#13;
to &#13;
deliver &#13;
services &#13;
will &#13;
provide &#13;
better results &#13;
than &#13;
government &#13;
provision &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
same &#13;
services. &#13;

project &#13;
is &#13;
being &#13;
prepared &#13;
under &#13;

Emergency &#13;
Recovery &#13;
Assistance. Nonetheless, &#13;
the &#13;
procedures &#13;
and &#13;
approaches &#13;
being &#13;
proposed under &#13;
the &#13;
Environmental &#13;
and &#13;
Social &#13;
Safeguards &#13;
Framework &#13;
for &#13;
other  projects &#13;
in &#13;
Afghanistan &#13;
(infrastructure, &#13;
education, &#13;
and &#13;
community &#13;
driven &#13;
development) &#13;
will &#13;
also &#13;
be &#13;
applied &#13;
to &#13;
this project. &#13;
The &#13;
project &#13;
is &#13;
classified &#13;
as &#13;
environmental &#13;
category &#13;
"B", &#13;
and &#13;
safeguards &#13;
classification &#13;
"S2". &#13;
45. &#13;
Environmental &#13;
Issues. &#13;
Most &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
environmental &#13;
issues &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
proposed &#13;
project &#13;
relate &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
management &#13;
of &#13;
wastes &#13;
generated &#13;
in &#13;
BHCs &#13;
and &#13;
rural &#13;
hospitals. &#13;
The &#13;
most &#13;
important medical &#13;
waste &#13;
arising &#13;
from &#13;
these &#13;
sources &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
sharps &#13;
(needles, &#13;
syringes &#13;
and &#13;
lancets) &#13;
and &#13;
other &#13;
pathological &#13;
materials &#13;
such &#13;
as &#13;
used &#13;
dressings. &#13;
The &#13;
main &#13;
approach &#13;
to &#13;
dealing &#13;
with &#13;
health &#13;
care &#13;
waste &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
segregation &#13;
of &#13;
pathological &#13;
materials &#13;
and &#13;
deep &#13;
burial. &#13;
Sharps &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
collected &#13;
in &#13;
safety &#13;
boxes &#13;
which &#13;
will &#13;
be buried &#13;
deeply according &#13;
to &#13;
WHO &#13;
guidelines. &#13;
A &#13;
draft &#13;
environmental &#13;
plan &#13;
has &#13;
been &#13;
developed &#13;
and &#13;
disclosed &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
public &#13;
which &#13;
envisions &#13;
three &#13;
phases: &#13;
(i) &#13;
pilot &#13;
testing &#13;
of &#13;
simple &#13;
and &#13;
appropriate &#13;
approaches &#13;
during &#13;
the &#13;
first &#13;
year &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
project &#13;
with &#13;
guidelines &#13;
and &#13;
training &#13;
modules &#13;
developed &#13;
based &#13;
on &#13;
field &#13;
experience; &#13;
(ii) &#13;
widespread &#13;
dissemination &#13;
of &#13;
and &#13;
training &#13;
on &#13;
the &#13;
guidelines &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
carried &#13;
out &#13;
during &#13;
the &#13;
last &#13;
two &#13;
years &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
project; &#13;
and &#13;
(iii) &#13;
a &#13;
longer-term &#13;
development &#13;
of &#13;
an &#13;
Action &#13;
Plan &#13;
for &#13;
Management &#13;
of &#13;
Health &#13;
Care &#13;
Waste based &#13;
on &#13;
analysis &#13;
of &#13;
waste &#13;
volume &#13;
and &#13;
field &#13;
experience. &#13;
The &#13;
procedures &#13;
to &#13;
be followed &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
collection &#13;
and &#13;
disposal &#13;
of &#13;
wastes &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
included &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
PPAs &#13;
and &#13;
monitored &#13;
as &#13;
part &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
third &#13;

performance &#13;
audits &#13;

46. &#13;
Indigenous &#13;

In &#13;
order &#13;
to &#13;
ensure &#13;
that &#13;
all &#13;
ethnic &#13;
groups &#13;
obtain &#13;
equitable benefits &#13;
from &#13;
project &#13;
investments, &#13;
the &#13;
MOH &#13;
will: &#13;
(i) &#13;
ensure &#13;
that &#13;
the &#13;
distribution &#13;
of &#13;
BHCs &#13;
by &#13;
district &#13;
is &#13;
fairly &#13;
and &#13;
transparently &#13;
decided; &#13;
(ii) &#13;
ensure &#13;
that &#13;
PPAs &#13;
are &#13;
differentially &#13;
focused &#13;
on &#13;
provinces &#13;
which &#13;
are &#13;
currently &#13;
under-served &#13;
(many &#13;
of &#13;
which &#13;
have &#13;
significant &#13;
populations &#13;
of &#13;
ethnic &#13;
minorities); &#13;
and &#13;
(iii) &#13;
use &#13;
the results &#13;
of &#13;
household &#13;
surveys &#13;
to &#13;
gauge &#13;
the &#13;
access &#13;
of &#13;
services &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
different &#13;
ethnic &#13;
minorities &#13;
and have &#13;
the &#13;
MOH &#13;
and &#13;

make &#13;
course &#13;
corrections where &#13;
needed. &#13;

administrative &#13;
procedures &#13;

will &#13;
be &#13;
accounted &#13;

if &#13;
operational &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
selected &#13;
provinces. &#13;
13. &#13;
For &#13;
purposes &#13;
of &#13;
funds &#13;
flow &#13;
planning, &#13;
it &#13;
is &#13;
important &#13;
that &#13;
the &#13;
Project&#146;s &#13;
CFA, &#13;
NGOs, &#13;
MOH &#13;
provincial &#13;
officials, &#13;
FM &#13;

MOF-Treasury &#13;
Officials, &#13;
and &#13;
DAB &#13;
staff &#13;
closely &#13;
coordinate, &#13;
monitor &#13;
and &#13;
communicate &#13;
cash &#13;
flow &#13;
requirements &#13;
for &#13;
project &#13;
activities. &#13;
14. &#13;
Due  to &#13;
reasons &#13;
related &#13;
to &#13;
security, &#13;
damaged &#13;
infrastructure, &#13;
and &#13;
a &#13;
breakdown &#13;
in &#13;
communication  between &#13;
the  branches &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
Kabul &#13;
office &#13;
of &#13;
DAB, &#13;
the &#13;
TISA &#13;
will &#13;
face &#13;
a &#13;
challenge &#13;
in &#13;
effecting &#13;
payments throughout &#13;
the country. &#13;
Although &#13;
not &#13;
all &#13;
of &#13;
DAB&#146;S &#13;
branches &#13;
are &#13;
currently &#13;
fully &#13;
functional, &#13;
efforts &#13;
are &#13;
being &#13;
made &#13;
to &#13;
rehabilitate the &#13;
branches &#13;
so &#13;
that the &#13;
TISA&#146;s &#13;
payment &#13;
needs &#13;
throughout &#13;
the &#13;
country can &#13;
be &#13;
met, &#13;
including &#13;
making &#13;
arrangements &#13;
for &#13;
secure &#13;
transport &#13;
of &#13;
cash &#13;
notes &#13;
around &#13;
the &#13;
country. &#13;
In &#13;
the  short &#13;
term, &#13;
there &#13;
could be &#13;
a &#13;
shortage &#13;
of &#13;
Afghani &#13;
currency &#13;
notes &#13;
within &#13;
the &#13;
government. &#13;
15. &#13;
The &#13;
PPA &#13;
NGOs &#13;
will &#13;
receive &#13;
hnds &#13;
transfers &#13;
at &#13;
the &#13;
center &#13;
or &#13;
in &#13;
foreign &#13;
currency &#13;
outside &#13;
Afghanistan &#13;
if &#13;
they &#13;
have &#13;
international &#13;
bank &#13;
accounts, &#13;
and &#13;
they &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
entirely &#13;
responsible &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
transport,  custody, &#13;
safekeeping &#13;
and &#13;
distribution &#13;
of &#13;
funds &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
and &#13;
districts. &#13;
From &#13;
an &#13;
MOH &#13;
perspective, &#13;
this &#13;
arrangement  presents  a &#13;
far &#13;
lower  level &#13;
of &#13;
fiduciary &#13;
risk &#13;
than &#13;
the &#13;
transfer &#13;
of &#13;
funds &#13;
to &#13;
provincial &#13;
MOH &#13;
officials &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
other &#13;
three  provinces, &#13;
by &#13;

the &#13;
26 &#13;
Page  33&#13;
Mustaufiats &#13;
or &#13;
through &#13;
other &#13;
couriers. Therefore, &#13;
less &#13;
than &#13;
one-third &#13;
of &#13;
proj &#13;
ect &#13;
expenditures &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
vulnerable &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
potentially &#13;
higher &#13;
level &#13;
of &#13;
risk &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
transfer &#13;
of &#13;
funds &#13;
from &#13;
the &#13;

Accounting &#13;
Challenges &#13;
16. &#13;
The &#13;
MOH &#13;
is &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
midst &#13;
of &#13;
a &#13;
major &#13;
reorganization &#13;
which &#13;
is &#13;
expected &#13;
to &#13;
be &#13;
shortly &#13;
completed, &#13;
approved &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
Minister &#13;
of &#13;
Health &#13;
and &#13;
ratified &#13;
by &#13;
the President &#13;
and &#13;
cabinet &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
TISA. &#13;
At &#13;
that &#13;
point, &#13;
the &#13;
incumbents &#13;
selected &#13;
as &#13;
department  directors &#13;
and &#13;
unit &#13;
heads &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
announced. &#13;
(i) &#13;
As &#13;
mentioned &#13;
in &#13;
paragraph &#13;
6 &#13;
above, &#13;
the &#13;
financial, &#13;
accounting, &#13;
auditing &#13;
and &#13;
information &#13;
system &#13;
aspects &#13;
of &#13;
MOH &#13;
operations &#13;
will &#13;
need &#13;
to &#13;
be &#13;
led, &#13;
managed and &#13;
coordinated &#13;
by &#13;
a &#13;
CFA, &#13;
a &#13;
position &#13;
not &#13;
currently &#13;
reflected &#13;
on &#13;
the &#13;
MOH &#13;
organogram. &#13;
As &#13;
an &#13;
immediate &#13;
"stop &#13;
gap" &#13;
measure &#13;
until &#13;
the &#13;
new &#13;
CFA &#13;
is &#13;
recruited &#13;
as &#13;
part &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
upcoming ARTF-funded &#13;
project, &#13;
it &#13;
is &#13;
imperative &#13;
that  the &#13;
FM &#13;
Agent &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
MOF &#13;
assist &#13;
and &#13;
support &#13;
the &#13;
MOH &#13;
in &#13;
providing &#13;
a &#13;
sufficient &#13;
level &#13;
of &#13;
accounting &#13;
capacity, &#13;
resource and oversight, &#13;
to &#13;
control &#13;
and &#13;
protect &#13;
IDA'S &#13;
funding &#13;
and &#13;
disbursement &#13;
on &#13;
this &#13;
project. &#13;
(ii) &#13;
The &#13;
new &#13;
unit &#13;
head &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
BFM &#13;
Unit &#13;
will &#13;
need &#13;
at &#13;
least one &#13;
project &#13;
accounting &#13;
staff &#13;
member &#13;
with &#13;
at &#13;
least &#13;
three &#13;
years &#13;
of &#13;
accountinglfinancial &#13;
experience &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
public &#13;
sector &#13;
to &#13;
handle &#13;
the &#13;
accounting, &#13;
reporting, &#13;
reconciliation &#13;
and &#13;
control &#13;
requirements &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
health &#13;
project &#13;
expenditures. &#13;
(iii) &#13;
It &#13;
is &#13;
very &#13;
likely &#13;
that &#13;
the &#13;
accounting &#13;
and  reporting &#13;
skills &#13;
of &#13;
MOH &#13;
provincial &#13;
accounting &#13;
and &#13;
financial  staff &#13;
will &#13;
need &#13;
to &#13;
be &#13;
considerably &#13;
strengthened &#13;
and &#13;
appropriate &#13;
support, &#13;
on &#13;
the &#13;
job &#13;
and &#13;
"classroomyy &#13;

on &#13;
a &#13;
continuing, &#13;
sustainable basis &#13;
for &#13;
at &#13;
least &#13;
nine &#13;
to &#13;
12 &#13;
months. &#13;

from &#13;
the &#13;
Department &#13;
of &#13;

has &#13;
begun &#13;
to &#13;
examine &#13;
its &#13;

In &#13;
order &#13;
to &#13;
adequately &#13;
handle &#13;

and &#13;
monitoring &#13;
of &#13;
Project &#13;

the &#13;
MOH &#13;

have &#13;
to do &#13;
the &#13;
following: &#13;
(i) &#13;
MOH &#13;

(iii) &#13;
MOH &#13;
central &#13;

Page  34&#13;
(iv) &#13;
Appropriate &#13;
reconciliation &#13;

be &#13;
developed &#13;
between &#13;
MOH &#13;
central &#13;
and &#13;
provincial &#13;
accounting  records &#13;
and &#13;
between &#13;

18. &#13;
Payments &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
PPA &#13;
NGOs &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
made &#13;
at &#13;
the &#13;

if &#13;
the &#13;
NGOs &#13;
have &#13;

done &#13;
under &#13;
a &#13;
mechanism &#13;
acceptable &#13;
to &#13;
MOF &#13;
and &#13;
IDA. &#13;
19. &#13;
Once the above &#13;
staff &#13;
recruitments &#13;
are &#13;
in &#13;
process, &#13;
and &#13;
procedures &#13;

the &#13;
view &#13;
that &#13;
if &#13;
successful, &#13;
this &#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Health Sector Emergency
            Reconstruction and Development Project seeks to develop a
            health care system that will equitably deliver basic health
            services to underserved rural populations, in a sustainable
            manner. Key performance indicators highlight infant
            mortality, malnutrition in children, fertility rates, and
            maternal mortality ratios. The main components seek to: 1)
            expand basic health services through performance-based
            partnership agreements (PPAs), and, implement strengthened
            mechanisms within the Ministry of Health (MOH), to increase
            access to the Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS),
            including first level hospital services, as well as training
            provision to community health workers, traditional birth
            attendants, and female auxiliary mid-wives; 2) provide
            equipment and furniture to existing rural health facilities,
            in addition to construction of new basic, and comprehensive
            health centers, supported by other donors, particularly the
            United States Agency for International Development (USAID).
            The component shall include basic surgical equipment, and
            ensure support for caesarian sections, and capability to
            manage traumatic injuries; 3) support pilot tests for a safe
            water system, to decrease the incidence of diarrheal
            diseases; and, innovate health care financing mechanisms, by
            including a community health contribution comparable to user
            charges; and, 4) help build capacity through training
            assistance, provision of solar-powered radios, and computers
            to facilitate supervision, and monitoring, and, strengthen
            MOH health management capacity.
