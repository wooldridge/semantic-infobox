YANGTZE FLOOD EMERGENCY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
A. BACKGROUND AND STRATEGY&#13;
Country Background and Flood History&#13;
1.    Floods are very devastating in China and their occurrences are as old as the&#13;
country's history. There are several weather systems that occur over China that can cause&#13;
prolonged, widespread and intensive rainstorms over the mountain, plain and coastal areas&#13;
depending on where the rainstorms are located. Frequently, several weather fronts can&#13;
roll over the country or regions one after another, causing the main rivers to peak several&#13;
times and overtop the river banks (or dikes), flooding vast areas and causing devastating&#13;
damage. Flash floods usually occur in the hilly areas after severe rainstorms and,&#13;
combined with landslides, displace and kill many people. More than half of China's flood&#13;
casualties are in the hilly areas where flash floods and landslides have buried villages. In&#13;
addition, the coastal areas (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong Provinces) are&#13;
subject to damage caused by typhoon-related flooding and tidal surges.&#13;
2.    Beside weather patterns, other factors contributing to floods are mainly man-&#13;
induced. Extensive logging of natural forest in the upper catchment areas of major river&#13;
systems have deforested large areas, leading to serious soil erosion, silting and aggradation&#13;
of river channels in middle and lower reaches, all leading to higher flood levels and larger&#13;
flood volumes. Increased water diversion for consumptive uses (i.e., Yellow River) has&#13;
caused deteriorating morphology of riverbeds. The reduced flows have sharply decreased&#13;
sediment transport and the carrying capacity of river channels, which increases the&#13;
probability of a given flood to overtop the riverbanks. In the Yangtze and Huai River&#13;
basins, large areas of lakes and low-lying areas have been reclaimed for habitation and&#13;
cultivation, reducing the flood detention capacity that would help to reduce the flood&#13;
levels of the main rivers.&#13;
3.    Despite centuries of flood control and protection works to keep river floods within&#13;
their banks, devastation still occurs almost yearly in China in one or more of its eight&#13;
major river basins In this century, major flood events have occurred in 1931, 1954, 1991,&#13;
1993, 1996 and 1998, with increasing frequency and severity during the 1990s. In the&#13;
1931 flood, some 400,000 people were killed and more than 50 million people in the&#13;
Yangtze and Huai River basins were seriously affected. However, the loss of life has been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
significantly reduced from the pre-1950 periods due to improvements made to the main&#13;
river protection systems and the flood warning and evacuation plans that allow timely&#13;
evacuation of people to safety, and more effective control of the spread of epidemic&#13;
diseases that used to kill thousands after floods. Despite major investments in the past,&#13;
the flood protection standard on the major rivers is still very low, i.e., it is only 10-20&#13;
years recurrence level of protection in the Yangtze River (without flood detention), 50-60&#13;
years in the Yellow River, 40 years in the Huai River, about 20 years in the Liao, Songhua&#13;
and Zhujiang rivers.&#13;
4.    With such low levels of flood protection, areas subject to flooding have been on&#13;
the increase since the 1950s. Flooded areas averaged over 10 million hectares (ha) in the&#13;
1990s, but in 1998's historic flood, the areas affected reached over 21 million ha. Flood&#13;
damage and losses have reached an enormous level. In the 1 990s total flood damages and&#13;
losses have been estimated at $130 billion, 17 million houses destroyed, and 70 million ha&#13;
of farmland affected. Economic and social losses are expected to increase as China&#13;
concentrates its economic growth along major rivers. Extreme population and land&#13;
pressures have forced millions of people to encroach on natural floodplains and even&#13;
between river dikes. Flood detention basins or lakes have also been rapidly and highly&#13;
developed, reducing much of their flood detention capacities. Some 17 million people are&#13;
estimated to live in detention basins and lakes in the Yangtze, Yellow and Huai River&#13;
basins and lakes. They are very vulnerable to any minor flood and would suffer&#13;
devastating damage in any major flood.&#13;
5.    The Floods of 1998. Persistent torrential rains in the summer of 1998 caused&#13;
enormous flooding in the Yangtze River Basin and northeast China. The floods have&#13;
affected one-fifth of China's population in 29 provinces, over 3,600 people have died, and&#13;
about 5 million ha of crops were destroyed. There has been severe damage to schools,&#13;
hospitals, power and water facilities, roads, bridges, factories and irrigation systems.&#13;
Economic losses are over $36 billion. The losses and hardships of the people would have&#13;
been much worse without a massive flood-fighting operation mounted by the central&#13;
government, the provinces, all levels of local government, and the armed services.&#13;
6.    Yangtze River Flood. The Yangtze is China's largest river, 6,300 kilometers long,&#13;
with a basin covering 1.8 million square kilometers (km2). It holds half a billion people or&#13;
45 percent of China's total population, produces about 42 percent of its gross domestic&#13;
product (GDP), and consumes just over 43 percent of the country's total investment in&#13;
fixed assets. Over half of China's industrial output is now generated within the basin. Of&#13;
the country's estimated 400 million urban dwellers, 180 million live in the basin's 250&#13;
cities and create almost a quarter of China's total GDP.&#13;
7.    A combination of events caused the vast areas of inundation in the Yangtze basin.&#13;
First, the extreme rainfall began in June and continued into late August. Second, water&#13;
levels in the Yangtze surpassed record levels. Third, tributaries in the middle reach also&#13;
carried record flows for long periods. Fourth, rainfall in areas behind the Yangtze&#13;
embankments was unprecedented--in some places estimated to have a 300-year return&#13;
period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
8.    In the Yangtze's middle reach, widespread unprecedented rainstorms occurred&#13;
during June and July and caused flash floods in the provinces of Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi.&#13;
Rivers and lakes were rapidly filled. The resultant torrential floods in the hilly regions,&#13;
coupled with mudslides, caused devastating damage to villages along the rivers, roads and&#13;
bridges, and killed many who were trapped by the flash floods. Flooding in the lake and&#13;
poldered areas was further aggravated by the high river stage in the Yangtze River (in all,&#13;
eight flood peak waves occurred) during August and early September. Consequently, vast&#13;
areas behind the Yangtze River dikes were inundated for almost three months due to back&#13;
flow of Yangtze water. Some poldered areas were deliberately breached for flood release&#13;
and detention to reduce critical flood levels threatening the key city of Wuhan.&#13;
Floodwater levels and flows recorded in the Yangtze exceeded the 1954 levels, the highest&#13;
of modern times. High water levels persisted for more than 60 days, compared to less&#13;
than 30 days in the high floods of 1954 and 1931. Table 1 compares the 1998 flood with&#13;
the past major flood events. Despite these unprecedented conditions, there was only one&#13;
breach in the Yangtze River dikes. This breach, which occurred on August 7, 1998 at&#13;
Jiujiang in Jiangxi Province, was closed in a few days through heroic efforts that will&#13;
become a legend in China's flood-fighting history.&#13;
9.    Commendable efforts were organized by the provincial government to contain the&#13;
Yangtze River flood from breaching the main dikes. Millions of people were affected by&#13;
the flood and evacuated to safety on high ground and on top of the dikes. The flood has&#13;
made millions homeless, destroyed or damaged many infrastructure and social services&#13;
facilities. There is an urgent need for aftermath flood recovery works to restore and&#13;
rehabilitate the damaged and destroyed public infrastructure and social services so as to&#13;
restore rapidly the economic production systems.&#13;
10.   Flood Damage. Due to widespread flooding of great depths and duration,&#13;
damage has been devastating, affecting practically all the sectors in the three provinces.&#13;
The worst areas were the breached poldered areas behind the Yangtze main dikes and the&#13;
areas fringing the lakes, which were flooded by the back flow of the Yangtze. Preliminary&#13;
flood damages assessed are summarized in Table 2. Total economic losses estimated for&#13;
Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi are $6.6, $3.96 and $4.63 billion, respectively. Final damages&#13;
and economic losses are expected to be much higher because some of the poldered areas&#13;
are still submerged as the breached polders have not yet been repaired, and large quantities&#13;
of materials acquired by the the government for flood-fighting have not yet been fully&#13;
costed.&#13;
11.   Flood Relief. During the floods the three provincial governments organized the&#13;
evacuation of millions of people, especially those staying in the breached poldered areas,&#13;
to higher ground (many on river dikes) and housed them in temporary shelters. Adequate&#13;
relief (rations, water and warm clothing) and health services were provided and maintained&#13;
throughout the floods with aid and donations in cash and kind from in-country and&#13;
overseas received by the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Flood relief and aid are also being&#13;
provided by the Federation of International Red Cross and Red Crescent, United Nations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
Disaster Management Team (FAO, ILO, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF,&#13;
UNIDO, WFP, WHO) under UNDP, and other international communities in China.&#13;
12.   Recovery Plan. Recognizing the 1998 devastating flood in Yangtze River and the&#13;
possibility of greater damage and losses incurred should the main Yangtze River dikes be&#13;
overtopped or breached in future floods, the central government has issued the following&#13;
policy directives to the nation, especially to the most severely flooded provinces of Hubei,&#13;
Hunan and Jiangxi:&#13;
(a) stop logging in the natural forest areas in the upper catchment, and plant trees&#13;
for reforestation;&#13;
(b) restore cultivated land on slopes &gt;25 degrees to forest in the upper catchment&#13;
areas;&#13;
(c) remove polders (in flood detention and lake basins) for flood diversion and&#13;
detention;&#13;
(d) return reclamation areas in flood channels to facilitate floodwater evacuation;&#13;
(e) use aid (cash and materials) for flood recovery works to be undertaken by&#13;
flood victims;&#13;
(f) relocate and resettle flood-affected people to new villages and townships less&#13;
vulnerable to floods;&#13;
(g) strengthen river dikes and flood-controlling reservoirs; and&#13;
(h) dredge silted river channels.&#13;
13.   Logging in upper catchment areas (Sichuan Province for the Yangtze River) has&#13;
been officially banned since September 1, 1998. This will have a long-term positive&#13;
impact on soil and water conservation and reduce the incidence of flooding downstream.&#13;
The three provincial governments are planning massive programs to relocate and resettle&#13;
about 1.5 million people (Hubei 820,000, Hunan 25,000, Jiangxi 46,000) over the next&#13;
three years in new villages and townships to be constructed on higher ground less&#13;
vulnerable to floods. Poldered areas will be consolidated and some secondary polders&#13;
would be abandoned and returned to lakes, and others without people residing in them&#13;
would be used for flood release and detention. Reconstruction work programs are being&#13;
carried out by flood-affected people in the three provinces in exchange for relief in cash&#13;
and kind. The central government, in collaboration with the three provincial governments,&#13;
is planning major flood control and protection works on the Yangtze River that would&#13;
include strengthening the main river dikes, raising the flood protection standards,&#13;
constructing flood control works on some of the main tributaries, and improving the flood&#13;
protection management of key lake basins (Dongting, Poyang, Honghu and Sihu lakes,&#13;
etc.). Bank financing of $300 million has been proposed by the Government for the&#13;
FY2000 lending program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

B. BANK GROUP RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
14.   Rationale for Bank Group Involvement. Bank Group involvement in the&#13;
proposed project will accelerate the restoration of economic and social activities through&#13;
the rebuilding of water supply works, roads, schools, and health centers. The project is&#13;
consistent with the Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy for China (Report No.&#13;
1632 1-CHA) presented to the Board on March 18, 1997 and the CAS Progress Report&#13;
(Report No. R98-107) of May 28, 1998, focusing on poverty alleviation and the&#13;
reconstruction of essential infrastructure. The next CAS, now under preparation, will also&#13;
focus on the water sector and the need for the Bank Group's short- and long-term strategy&#13;
and involvement in view of the increasing frequency of floods and economic losses&#13;
suffered in the county.&#13;
15.   Responding to a request for assistance from the Ministry of Finance (MOF), a&#13;
Bank Group reconnaissance mission visited the affected areas in Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi&#13;
Provinces from September 16 to 22, 1998. This was followed by an appraisal mission&#13;
from November 11 to 24, 1998.&#13;
16.   China has previously received assistance from the Bank Group after major natural&#13;
disasters. Recovery and salvage operations after a major forest fire in northeastern China&#13;
were successfully supported under the Da Xing An Ling Forest Fire Rehabilitation&#13;
Program (FY88, $56.9 million), and earthquake reconstruction was supported under (a)&#13;
the China Earthquake Reconstruction Project (FY90, $30 million equivalent); (b) the Inner&#13;
Mongolia and Yunnan Earthquake Reconstruction Program (FY97, $65 million&#13;
equivalent); and (c) the Hebei Earthquake Rehabilitation Project (FY98, $28.4 million&#13;
equivalent)&#13;
17.   Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Group Assistance. The proposed&#13;
project is modeled on the North China Earthquake Project, which was adopted&#13;
successfully in the Inner Mongolia and Yunnan Earthquake Reconstruction Program. In&#13;
the North China Earthquake Project the relevant lessons highlighted in the Bank Group's&#13;
Operations Evaluation Department (OED) Performance Audit Report dated June 27,&#13;
1996, included: (a) the importance of strong local leadership and local project&#13;
management offices; (b) attention to the Borrower's views; (c) minimization of bottlenecks&#13;
in the project's cash flow to accelerate urgent reconstruction activities; and (d) the benefits&#13;
of using "fast track" project processing in the Bank Group. Some of these lessons learned&#13;
have been applied in the design of this project.&#13;
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Project Preparation&#13;
18.   The proposed Loan and Credit have been prepared as an emergency operation in&#13;
accordance with the provision of OP/BP/GP 8.50, on the basis of the preliminary damage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
assessment carried out from September 16 to 22 and an appraisal of the recovery&#13;
proposals November 11 to 24, 1998 in the three provinces. Subprojects were selected&#13;
according to the following criteria: (a) facilities must be flood damaged or destroyed; (b)&#13;
urgently needed by the community; (c) priority for townships and poldered areas; (d) cost&#13;
effectiveness for restoration or reconstruction; and (e) capable of resisting similar floods in&#13;
future upon completion,&#13;
Project Objectives and Design&#13;
19.   The objective of the proposed project is to rebuild social and economic&#13;
infrastructure damaged by devastating floods in Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi provinces,&#13;
thereby restoring economic and social activities. In the project design, priorities have been&#13;
given to reconstruction of water supply and health facilities to prevent spread of diseases&#13;
after floods, and reconstruction of roads and bridges to restore key access to the flooded&#13;
areas so as to regenerate economic activities. Designs will also be based on current&#13;
national and provincial standards.&#13;
Project Components&#13;
20.   The project is located in 54 counties of Hubei (27), Hunan (15) and Jiangxi (12)&#13;
provinces that were most severely affected by floods from June to September 1998. The&#13;
main proposed components are:&#13;
(a) Roads (Total $49.4 million, World Bank Group--$32.5 million)&#13;
(i) Hubei Province: Ten subprojects have been proposed for restoration and&#13;
reconstruction, covering a total of about 130 km and 2 bridges in 12 counties&#13;
and cities. These roads would restore a traffic load of about 12.5 million ton-&#13;
km and traffic of 27,800 vehicles/day.&#13;
(ii) Hunan Province: A total of about 25 county roads totaling 465 km including&#13;
3 bridges would be restored and reconstructed, catering to about 47,600&#13;
vehicles/day.&#13;
(iii) Jiangxi Province: 49 roads in 12 counties totaling 351 km, including 926&#13;
bridges and culverts. Total traffic volume to be restored is estimated at 12,600&#13;
vehicles/day.&#13;
(b) Water Supply (Total $30.2 million, WB $18.3 million)&#13;
(i) Hubei Province: Seven county and city water supply plants would be&#13;
restored or reconstructed, serving a total population of about 547,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
(ii) Hunan Province: A total of 18 county and township water supply plants&#13;
would be restored and reconstructed. Some 1.27 million people would be&#13;
provided with clean and safe water.&#13;
(iii) Jiangxi Province: Thirty water supply plants in 11 counties are to be&#13;
restored and reconstructed to supply a total of 201,900 cubic meters/day of&#13;
safe and clean water to about 650,000 people in 37 townships and 148&#13;
villages.&#13;
(c) Schools (Total $18.8 million, WB $12.4 million)&#13;
(i) Hubei Province: A total of 38 secondary and primary schools would be&#13;
restored or reconstructed, covering a total built-up floor area of about 43,600&#13;
square meters (mi2), and serving a total student population of about 31,000.&#13;
(ii) Hunan Province: A total 28 secondary and primary schools damaged would&#13;
restored or reconstructed to serve a total student population of about 62,000.&#13;
(iii) Jiangxi Province: A total of 133 secondary and primary schools are to be&#13;
restored and reconstructed, covering a total built-up floor area of about&#13;
100,720 M2. These schools will serve a total student population of about&#13;
129,500.&#13;
(d) Health Centers and Clinics (Total $16.1 million, WB $10.7 million)&#13;
(i) Hubei Province: A total of 32 hospitals, health centers and clinics would be&#13;
restored or reconstructed, covering a total built-up floor area of about 63,200&#13;
in2. The restored facilities would serve about 1.12 million people.&#13;
(ii) Hunan Province: A total of 18 hospitals and health centers would be&#13;
restored or reconstructed to provide health services to about 1.3 million&#13;
people.&#13;
(iii) Jiangxi Province: A total of 93 hospitals, health centers and clinics will&#13;
restored and reconstructed in 12 counties, covering a total built-up floor area&#13;
of about 70,500 M2. This would restore health services to about 1.65 million&#13;
people, mostly in the flood-damaged areas.&#13;
(e) Irrigation and Drainage (Total $7.5 million, WB $5.0 million)&#13;
(i) Hubei Province: Irrigation and drainage facilities will be restored in 18&#13;
irrigation areas, covering a total area of 44,200 ha and benefiting about&#13;
446,000 farmers.&#13;
(f) Studies and Technical Assistance (Total $1.3 million WB $0.8 million)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
21.   A provision of $400,000, $200,000 and $200,000 will be allocated to Hubei,&#13;
Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces, respectively, for the following technical studies to be carried&#13;
out during 1999-2000 to strengthen the flood control and management capability of each&#13;
province:&#13;
(a) Hubei Province: The study will focus on development of a decision support&#13;
system to evaluate and optimize options for flood management in relation to&#13;
flood protection levels of the Yangtze dikes and flood diversion into flood&#13;
detention areas.&#13;
(b) Hunan Province: The study would focus on developing a computerized&#13;
model for flood forecasting, simulation and dispatch of the Zhi River system,&#13;
which is one of four major rivers flowing into Dongting Lake.&#13;
(c) Jiangxi Province: The study would focus on developing a computerized&#13;
model for flood forecasting, simulation and dispatch for the Gan and the Xiu&#13;
River systems which are two of the major rivers flowing into the Poyang&#13;
Lake.&#13;
22.   Details of subprojects for each component in each province are summarized in&#13;
Tables 3A and 3B.&#13;
D. Project Cost and Financing Plan&#13;
23.   The project cost is estimated at Y 1,100 million (US$132.5 million equivalent),&#13;
including a physical contingency allowance of 5 percent but no price contingencies in view&#13;
of the short disbursement period. The Bank Group will provide a Loan/Credit of US$80&#13;
million, which will meet 60 percent of the total cost. The remaining $52.5 million will be&#13;
provided by the Government. The project costs and financing are summarized in Table 3.&#13;
D. STUDIES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
24.   The Bank Group would provide $400,000, $200,000, and $200,000 to Hubei,&#13;
Hunan and Jiangxi, respectively, to finance technical studies and assistance to review&#13;
existing or develop new flood control and protection management systems within each&#13;
province. The technical studies and assistance would cover the following:&#13;
(a) Hubei. Hubei Province has a total about 1,065 km of Yangtze River dikes&#13;
and thousands of km of secondary dikes protecting the various major lakes&#13;
(Honghu, Sihu, etc.) and polders. The study would focus on the most critical&#13;
sections of the Yangtze River dikes at Jinzhou, Jian Li and Honghu river&#13;
systems and flood detention areas to optimize the overall flood control and&#13;
management techniques.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
(b)  Hunan The study would focus on developing a flood forecasting, simulation&#13;
and dispatch system for the Zhi River system, which is a representative river&#13;
system for the four major rivers flowing into Dongting Lake. The&#13;
computerized simulation model would then be modified and adapted for the&#13;
other three river systems. The river flood simulation models would be&#13;
integrated with the overall flood management model currently being studied&#13;
by a Canadian consulting firm. Some of the existing hydrological stations&#13;
would also be upgraded with telemetric equipment to monitor and report&#13;
real-time events.&#13;
(c)  Jiangxi. The study would focus on developing flood forecasting, simulation&#13;
and dispatch systems for the Gan and Xiu Rivers, two of the five major river&#13;
systems flowing into Poyang Lake before discharging into the Yangtze River.&#13;
The Gan River has about 51.5 percent of Poyang Lake catchment area of&#13;
162,200 km2. Xiu River has the largest earth-filled dam in Asia with a&#13;
embankment height of 165 m and reservoir capacity of about 7 billion cubic&#13;
meters. The flood simulation and dispatch models developed would enhance&#13;
the flood management of the central Poyang Lake region, which is a highly&#13;
developed agricultural base with a total population of about 10.2 million&#13;
people.&#13;
E. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Project Organization and Management&#13;
25.   Project Leading Groups (PLGs) would be established at the province, prefecture,&#13;
city, and county levels to organize and direct implementation of project works. The&#13;
members of these PLGs would include directors or vice directors of Finance, Planning,&#13;
Construction Commission, Water Supply, Transportation, Health, and Education Bureaus.&#13;
The main functions of the PLGs are to coordinate the different government agencies&#13;
involved, to approve major policies related to flood reconstruction activities, and to make&#13;
sure that counterpart funds for the project are available in adequate amounts and in a&#13;
timely manner. Under each PLG, a Project Management Office (PMO) would be set up to&#13;
coordinate project preparation, supervise project implementation, review and verify claims&#13;
for reimbursement, and consolidate such claims and submit them to the Provincial Finance&#13;
Bureau for payment from the Special Account. The Provincial PMO (PPMO) will prepare&#13;
progress reports in a format agreed with the Bank Group and arrange for accounts and&#13;
audits. The organizational structure for project implementation and management is shown&#13;
in Figure 1.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
26.   The proposed reconstruction works would focus on top priority works in the&#13;
most severely affected counties in each of the three provinces. This is to ensure quick&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
results and maximum impact, and to save time and cost in project supervision and&#13;
management. As most of the works would be of a small scale and scattered, it would be&#13;
most efficient carried out by the local contractors or construction teams who can mobilize&#13;
the required resources very quickly. The specialized bureaus of the local governments&#13;
(prefecture, city and county) will carry out planning and design for the works. The PMOs&#13;
would be responsible for project implementation, with assistance from the local&#13;
government technical departments in supervising construction works awarded on basis of&#13;
competitive bids (priced quotations and national competitive bidding). The project is&#13;
expected to be completed within three years (1999-2001), with most of the works&#13;
substantially completed during 1999-2000.&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
27.   Given the emergency nature of the project and the small and scattered works,&#13;
international competitive bidding (ICB) would not be feasible. Therefore, the following&#13;
procedures are proposed; these are in accordance with the "Guidelines for Procurement&#13;
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits of January 1995," revised January and August 1996,&#13;
September 1997, and January 1999:&#13;
(a)   Civil Works and Buildings:  Those essential and emergency works&#13;
identified to save lives and property would be procured prior to September&#13;
1, 1999 through lump-sum or unit price contracts (up to $1 million per&#13;
contract and aggregate value of $69.6 million) on the basis of quotations&#13;
obtained from at least three qualified domestic contractors in response to a&#13;
written invitation. These procedures were adopted in the China Hebei&#13;
Earthquake Rehabilitation Project (FY98) and found satisfactory.  The&#13;
remaining small works not procured prior to September 1, 1999 would also&#13;
be procured through price quotation subject to a threshold of not more than&#13;
$300,000 per contract and an aggregate value of $11.9 million. For other&#13;
works with values ranging from $300,000 to $5 million per contract,&#13;
national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures would be followed using&#13;
Chinese Model Bidding Documents for Procurement of Works that have&#13;
been developed by MOF for Bank Group-financed projects in China. The&#13;
aggregate value for these 30 NCB contracts is estimated at $32.6 million&#13;
(b)  Goods: The required construction materials will be included in the unit&#13;
prices for the relevant work items in works contracts. Small quantities of&#13;
pumps, motors, transformers and pipes, mostly for water supply system, up&#13;
to $100,000 per contract and aggregate value of $3.8 million, would be&#13;
procured on the basis of national shopping quotations from at least three&#13;
established suppliers. Goods costing more than $100,000 but less than&#13;
$250,000 per contract with an estimated aggregate value of $4.2 million&#13;
would be procured through NCB procedures. Goods estimated to cost&#13;
$250,000 or more would be procured by ICB procedures; however, none is&#13;
expected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
(c)   Studies may require the services of specialists on short-term assignments.&#13;
They will be employed in accordance with the "World Bank's Guidelines for&#13;
the Use of Consultants," dated January 1997, revised September 1997, and&#13;
January 1999. Consultants' service contracts with a value of more than&#13;
$100,000 would use Quality-and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS), less than&#13;
$100,000 by Consultants' Qualifications (QS) and less than $50,000 by&#13;
Individual selection. Consultants contracts over $100,000 for firms, or&#13;
$50,000 for individuals, would be subject to prior review by the Bank&#13;
Group. The terms of reference for engaging consultants with would be&#13;
subject to prior review by the Bank Group.&#13;
(d)   Prior Review of Bid Documents. NCB bid documents for works with&#13;
value in excess of $2 million per contract and greater than $200,000 per&#13;
contract for goods would be subject to prior review by the Bank Group.&#13;
About 10 out of 30 NCB work contracts (43% of total value) and 5 out of&#13;
15 NCB goods contracts (30% of total value) would be subject to Bank's&#13;
prior review.&#13;
The procurement arrangements are summarized in the following table:&#13;

Financial Arrangements&#13;
28.   MOF will make the proceeds of the Loan available to Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi e&#13;
at the Bank's standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loan, with&#13;
a maturity of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, and the Credit for 17 years including 5&#13;
years of grace, at zero interest rate, and a service charge of 0.75 percent per year on&#13;
amounts withdrawn from the credit, and a commitment charge of 0.5 percent per year on&#13;
the principal amount of the Loan and Credit not withdrawn. Each province will relend to&#13;
the city, prefecture, county government and project entities at the same terms and&#13;
conditions of on lending by MOF to the three provinces except the repayment period and&#13;
grace period for the Loan and the Credit would be reduced by one year to provide&#13;
adequate time for the provinces to recover, process and prepare repayments to MOF.&#13;
29.   Counterpart funds would come from central, provincial and local government&#13;
contributions, private contribution funds received locally and overseas, self-raised funds by&#13;
project beneficiaries, and borrowing from local banks. Adequate and timely counterpart&#13;
funds have been assured by the three province for project implementation. Table 7 shows&#13;
the financing arrangements by the three provinces.&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
30.   Disbursements would be made for eligible expenditures against statements of&#13;
expenditures (SOEs) using procedures satisfactory to the Bank Group. Retroactive&#13;
financing not to exceed $16 million, equivalent to 20 percent of the Loan/Credit amount,&#13;
is recommended for eligible expenditures incurred from September 16, 1998 until signing&#13;
of the Loan/Credit Agreements. A Special Account would be established in each province&#13;
with an authorized allocation of $5 million. Audits of the project accounts would be&#13;
performed annually, with copies of the audit reports to be provided to the Bank Group by&#13;
June 30 of each year. The project is expected to be completed by December 31, 2001,&#13;
and the closing date would be June 30, 2002. The Loan/Credit wo'uld finance 65 percent&#13;
of expenditures for civil works and building, 100/100/75 percent for goods and 100&#13;
percent for studies and technical assistance. The proceeds are expected to be disbursed as&#13;
summarized in Table 9.&#13;
Accounts and Audits&#13;
31.   Provincial finance bureaus of the three provinces covered by the project have had&#13;
extensive prior experience with Bank Group-financed projects and will manage the special&#13;
accounts of the project. The provincial, city/prefecture and county PMOs, with their&#13;
respective provincial financial bureaus' close guidance and assistance, will maintain by&#13;
competent and experience staff separate accounts and records for the project and for all&#13;
SOE-related expenditures based on "Temporary Regulations on Financial and Accounting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
Management for Projects Financed by the World Bank" issued by MOF. A comprehensive&#13;
financial/accounting manual covering all major operation areas with proper controls has&#13;
been prepared by each province to ensure clear allocation of financial authority,&#13;
segregation and delegation of duties, and preparation of timely and accurate financial&#13;
statements. Audit arrangements will be similar to other Bank Group-financed projects and&#13;
will be audited by the National Audit office (NAO) or its branches in the three provinces.&#13;
Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
32.   The format, content and reporting frequency of a set of financial statements have&#13;
been discussed and agreed with the three provinces. In addition, semiannual progress&#13;
reports will be submitted to the Bank Group by the respective PPMOs. The project&#13;
financial/progress statements, together with contract awards and disbursement documents&#13;
will form the basis for routine monitoring of physical and financial progress. Table 4&#13;
shows the project physical and performance indicators to be monitored semiannually by&#13;
each province. The results are to be furnished to the Bank Group not later than July 31&#13;
and January 31 for the first half and the second half of the year respectively for review.&#13;
Each province will carry out a Mid-Term Review of the project implementation at the end&#13;
of 1999, and thereafter implement any changes to the work programs as reviewed and&#13;
agreed by the Bank.&#13;
F. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION&#13;
33.   As an emergency recovery loan to restore existing basic infrastructure and social&#13;
services damaged and destroyed by floods, financial and economic analyses have been&#13;
considered to be unnecessary and were not carried out. Instead, the benefits and social&#13;
impacts have been assessed. These are summarized in the Table 5. Some 84 county roads&#13;
with a total length of 945 km would be restored to provide vital access for economic&#13;
activities. A total of 55 county and township damaged water supply plants would be&#13;
restored or reconstructed to provide clean and safe water to about 2.5 million people. The&#13;
proposed 199 secondary and primary schools to be restored would accommodate 222,000&#13;
students who are now temporarily dispersed to neighboring schools or placed in makeshift&#13;
schools. Importantly, the 143 hospitals, health centers and clinics to be restored would&#13;
serve a total of about 4.0 million people/year and their early completion would help to&#13;
control the spread of gastrointestinal diseases in the flooded areas. Some 44,200 ha of&#13;
irrigated land in 18 areas would have their irrigation facilities restored for early production&#13;
by some 446,000 farmers. The damage is so widespread and severe that it is not possible&#13;
for the limited Bank Group loan/credit to cover all the flooded areas in each province.&#13;
However, for the selected project counties and townships, the subprojects to be&#13;
implemented would restore significant social services and facilities, thereby helping to&#13;
regenerate economic production and activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
G. ACTION PLAN&#13;
35.   The following have been agreed with the three provinces: (a) project leading&#13;
groups and project management offices at the provincial, prefecture and county level&#13;
would be maintained and provided with adequate resources; (b) each province would&#13;
make available the proceeds of the loan and credit relent by MOF to project entities on&#13;
terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank Group; (c) each province would monitor and&#13;
report semiannually the physical and financial progress of the project to the Bank Group;&#13;
(d) each province will carry out a Mid-Term Review of the project implementation&#13;
progress at the end of 1999, and any changes reviewed and agreed with the Bank would&#13;
be implemented by the respective province in 2000 and thereafter; (e) Hubei and Hunan&#13;
would submit technical feasibility reports and preliminary designs for major water supply&#13;
and road subprojects costing more than $10 million each to the Bank Group for prior&#13;
review and approval before implementation; (f) each province will apply and use the&#13;
provision of the agreed joint policy framework in resolving any involuntary resettlement,&#13;
land acquisition and compensation encountered during project implementation; and (g)&#13;
each province would implement the project according to the agreed Project&#13;
Implementation Plan (PIP).&#13;

            Rehabilitation Project

        <abstracts>
            The Yangtze Flood Emergency
            Rehabilitation Project aims to rebuild social and economic
            infrastructure damaged by the devastating floods in Hubei,
            Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces, thereby rapidly restoring
            economic production and social services. In the project
            design, priority has been given to restoring and rebuilding
            the water supply and health facilities to prevent the spread
            of diseases after the floods, and roads to restore key
            access to the flooded areas so as to regenerate economic
            activities. The main components are restoration and
            reconstruction of roads, water supply systems, county and
            township secondary and primary schools, hospitals, health
            centers and clinics, and irrigation systems. The project
            also provides for each province to upgrade existing or
            developing flood forecasting, and simulation and dispatch
            systems, taking into account the recent flood experience.
