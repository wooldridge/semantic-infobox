GHAZI-BAROTHA HYDROPOWER PROJECT&#13;
Loan and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:           Government of Pakistan (GOP)&#13;
Implementing Agency: Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA)&#13;
Beneficiary:        WAPDA&#13;
Poverty:            Not applicable&#13;
Amount:             US$350.0 million&#13;
Terms:              Payable in 20 years, including five years grace, at the standard interest rate for LIBOR&#13;
-based US Dollar single currency loans.&#13;
Commitment Fee:     0.75% on undisbursed loan balance, beginning 60 days after signing, less any waiver&#13;
Onlending Terms:    The total loan would be onlent to WAPDA on the following terms: (a) during&#13;
construction period of the project, a variable rate equal to the sum of the prevailing&#13;
World Bank Lending Rate plus a spread of 150 basis points; (b) after completion of&#13;
construction, a variable rate equal to the sum of the prevailing World Bank Lending Rate&#13;
plus a spread of 350 basis points. The repayment period would be up to 23 years&#13;
including up to 8 years of grace period. WAPDA will bear the foreign exchange risk.&#13;
Proiect&#13;
Description:        The proposed project woulid comprise the construction of the Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower&#13;
Plant (GBHP), the consolidation of the power sector reform program, technical&#13;
assistance and training components. The GBHP aims at utilizing 76 meters of head&#13;
available in the Indus River between the tailrace of Tarbela power station and its&#13;
confluence with Haro River, and includes: (a) a barrage and ancillary works near Ghazi&#13;
village; (b) a 52-km long concrete-lined power channel and its ancillary works with a&#13;
capacity of 1,600 cumecs; (c) a power complex and ancillary works located near the&#13;
village of Barotha with an installed capacity of 1,450 MW to generate about 6,600 GWh&#13;
of electricity annually; (d) transmission facilities for power evacuation; and (e)&#13;
implementation of the Environmental Management and Resettlement Plans. The power&#13;
sector reform component includes in particular: (a) setting up of GBHP as a separate&#13;
project entity within the framework of the corporatization program of WAPDA; (b)&#13;
establishment of a separate transmission and dispatch corporate entity; and (c) review of&#13;
the Government's policy and package of incentives for private power investments. The&#13;
technical assistance and training components are mainly designed to assist WAPDA in&#13;
carrying out the Environmental Management and Resettlement Plans.&#13;
Benefits:           The Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower Project is part of the least-cost expansion plan for the&#13;
generation system in the country. It would promote the efficient development of&#13;
hydropower resources thereby reducing the dependence on imported petroleum products&#13;
and the chronic shortfall in electricity supply. The Economic Rate of Return on the&#13;
power investment program which includes the proposed project, is estimated at about&#13;
27%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-ii-&#13;
Risks:              Risks which could affect the proposed project could relate to macroeconomic&#13;
performance of the country, uncertainty in the level of of private power supply and&#13;
project implementation. The broader macroeconomic risk of deterioration of the short-&#13;
term financial situation is mitigated by GOP's commitment to a sound fiscal and&#13;
monetary program supported by appropriate structural reform measures. The risk of&#13;
inconsistency between the macroeconomic framework and the increased level of Public&#13;
Sector Development Program resulting from the implementation of GBHP has been&#13;
mitigated by the provision of an annual review of WAPDA's investment program over a&#13;
five-year rolling period and the agreement that, during the implementation of GBHP,&#13;
GOP's Core Public Sector Development Program and its Social Action Program, would&#13;
not be adversely affected by the financing requirements of GBHP. The risk related to the&#13;
uncertainties in the level of private power supply has been mitigated by the agreement on&#13;
setting up policies and appropriate solicitation mechanism that would ensure timely&#13;
implementation of required additional capacity. The specific project implementation&#13;
risks have been also mitigated so that the probabilities of delay in project implementation&#13;
and cost overruns are considerably reduced. The non-mobilization of financmi risk has&#13;
been mitigated by the high priority given by GOP to the development of the project, thie&#13;
level and advanced status of commitments of different cofinanciers, and by the legal&#13;
agreements requiring WAPDA to generate local funds through improvement in efficiency&#13;
and satisfactory tariffs needed to enable it to comply with the financial covenants.&#13;
WAPDA's consistent record over the last seven years in meeting an ambitious cash&#13;
generation covenant provides additional comfort to the Project. Other major risks could&#13;
be caused by unsatisfactory resettlement, relocation and compensation of persons&#13;
affected by the project and delay in implementing steps identified to mitigate negative&#13;
environmental impacts.    These  risks  are  being  largely  mitigated  by  the&#13;
comprehensiveness of the Environment and Resettlement Management Plan and the&#13;
monitoring arrangements through: (a) setting a Project Information Center at project&#13;
site; (b) assistance of a Ghazi-Barotha Development Organization and of an independent&#13;
consultant for monitoring resettlement and relocation of project affected people and&#13;
implementation of environmental mitigation steps; (c) WAPDA's commitment to&#13;
implement an Integrated Regional Development Plan to support locally-based economic&#13;
activities in the area; and (d) continued support from the Independent Environment and&#13;
Resettlement Review Panel. To reduce risks of engineering nature, WAPDA will be&#13;
assisted by its consultant, and a panel of experts will monitor the activities periodically.&#13;
Further, geological and hydrological uncertainties are reduced to a minimum because of&#13;
the extensive investigations at the sites of the barrage, power chaniel and power house,&#13;
and the comprehensive knowledge gained in the construction and operation of Tarbela&#13;
Dam. Possible construction delays would be minimized by the advanced stage of the&#13;
procurement of major works, effective project management through WAPDA's internal&#13;
organization for the project and the assistance of its consultants.  To reduce delays&#13;
which could be caused by claims of the contractors, a Dispute Review Board is being&#13;
appointed to settle all claims as expeditiously as possible.&#13;

GHAZI-BAROTHA HYDROPOWER PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. THE ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
Overview&#13;
1.1   Since the late 1980s, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) has been implementing a broad-&#13;
based macroeconomic adjustment and structural reform program, supported by the Bank and the&#13;
Fund, for improving growth performance and addressing extemal and internal imbalances. The&#13;
energy sector is critical to the achievement of these objectives, since it accounts for about 33% of&#13;
public investments. In this context, GOP has been pursuing, with Bank support, a far-reaching&#13;
policy reform program in the energy sector, aimed at strengthening the key institutions, enhancing&#13;
energy efficiency, developing measures for resource mobilization, and attracting private&#13;
investments. As a result, new institutions have been created to encourage the construction of&#13;
power plants by the private sector and promote energy conservation, important energy price&#13;
reforms have been introduced, some of the main institutions have been restructured, the&#13;
operational and financial performance of the sector has improved, while the first private power&#13;
generation project (Hub-1292 MW) is being implemented. Despite these efforts, the development&#13;
of the sector continues to be constrained by a lack of financial resources and insufficient&#13;
implementation capability, resulting in continued energy shortages that constrain economic&#13;
growth. Load shedding persists, and reached the level of 27% of peak demand in FY94, while the&#13;
gas supply shortfall reached 600 million cubic feet per day, or about 25% of demand, during the&#13;
winter of 1994.&#13;
1.2   Recognizing the need for accelerating the implementation of the reform program in the&#13;
sector, GOP has decided to complement and reinforce its policy reform program by adopting a&#13;
more comprehensive energy strategy. An Energy Task Force (ETF) was constituted in late 1993&#13;
to formulate this strategy. ETF's report confirmed the need for the restructuring and privatization&#13;
program for the power sector, and the setting up of an independent Regulatory Authority, as&#13;
outlined in a Strategic Plan approved by the Government in July 1992 (para 2.3). The ETF report&#13;
also formed the basis for a Policy Framework and Package of Incentives for Private Sector Power&#13;
Generation Projects, and a Petroleum Policy, both announced in March 1994. In March 1995,&#13;
GOP broadened its policy by introducing a package of incentives for private sector participation&#13;
in the main 500 kV transmission lines, and in hydropower projects off the Indus River. These&#13;
policy documents set out a vision of greater dependence on market forces and private sector&#13;
involvement, including restructuring and privatization of the public enterprises in the sector.&#13;
Further, these policies support the establishment of a consistent institutional and incentive&#13;
ftameworkfor promoting energy conservation and the use of alternative energy resources.&#13;
1.3   The 1994 Petroleum Policy deals with both upstream and downstream activities. It&#13;
provides for a reduction in GOP oversight and involvement in the sector, including a lower&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
mandatory participating interest for GOP in new concessions, elimination of the gas allocation&#13;
policy for new discoveries in high risk areas, elimination of discretionary discounts for the&#13;
producer price of domestic crude and natural gas, establishment of an independent Petroleum&#13;
Regulatory Board, and the privatization of most of the public enterprises in the sector. For the&#13;
major enterprises, several offers of strategic equity partnerships from foreign petroleum&#13;
companies have been received. However, GOP has opted for a transparent bidding process rather&#13;
than negotiated deals, and has appointed financial advisors to achieve this objective. The Policy&#13;
also enhances the incentives for gas exploration in the country, by linking the producer price to a&#13;
basket of crudes; provides additional fiscal incentives for oil and gas exploration and&#13;
development; and introduces specific incentives for private investment in petroleum infrastructure&#13;
projects (i.e. pipelines and storage facilities) and in new refineries. These initiatives have elicited a&#13;
positive response from private investors, in particular international oil companies. As a result, as&#13;
of end-1994, all the blocks of acreage offered for exploration by GOP have been awarded and&#13;
active discussions are ongoing with private sponsors for investments in downstream petroleum&#13;
facilities. The Government is now preparing, with Bank assistance, a new incentive package for&#13;
off-shore petroleum exploration in Pakistan and an international road show held in July 1995&#13;
promoting six offshore blocks has generated considerable interest from private investors. An 87&#13;
km. long pipeline is being built by a private company to supply fuel oil to Hub and other planned&#13;
power projects west of Karachi. A memorandum of understanding was recently signed between&#13;
GOP and a private international consortium for the construction of an oil pipeline linking Karachi&#13;
with major consumption centers up-country.&#13;
1.4  In the power sector, GOP has begun the implementation of a three-pronged strategy: (a)&#13;
restructuring and unbundling the activities of the power sector utilities, including gradual&#13;
divestiture of selected assets of the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) and&#13;
privatization of the Karachi Electricity Supply Corporation (KESC); (b) construction of all new&#13;
thermal power plants and the main 500 kV transmission lines by the private sector on a Build-&#13;
Own-Operate (BOO) and Build-Own-Maintain (BOM) basis, respectively; and (c) establishment&#13;
of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA). GOP has been very active on&#13;
these fronts, and Chapter 2 gives the detail of progress made to-date.  In particular, an&#13;
amendment to the WAPDA Act was promulgated in 1994, to enable the sale of assets; a financial&#13;
advisor has been appointed for the sale of WAPDA's 1,600 MW Kot Addu thermal power plant,&#13;
preparatory work for the sale of KESC, the Jamshoro power plant (880 MW) and one distribution&#13;
Area Electricity Board (AEB) is underway; an ordinance creating NEPRA was promulgated in&#13;
January 1995, and staffing of NEPRA is underway.&#13;
1.5   With regard to the construction of new power generation plants by the private sector, the&#13;
new policy elicited an overwhelming response from both domestic and foreign investors. GOP is&#13;
negotiating security packages with sponsors of thirty-four different power plants with a potential&#13;
generating capacity of about 9,000 MW. In addition to the ongoing 1,292 MW Hub Power&#13;
Project, five other projects, with a total installed capacity of about 860MW (AES Pakistan&#13;
Limited (360 MW), Kohinoor (131 MW), Gull Ahmed (136 MW), Raiwind (117 MW) and&#13;
Tristar (120 MW)) reached financial closure in May, June, and October 1995, and at least four&#13;
other projects with a total capacity of about 1,000 MW are expected to reach financial closure&#13;
early 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
1.6   The Strategic Plan mentioned in para 1.2 calls for WAPDA to continue to own and&#13;
operate major hydropower projects in the Indus Basin, largely because of their importance for&#13;
irrigation. Within this framework, WAPDA will also continue to build selected new hydro-&#13;
electric plants that are part of the least-cost development plan for the power sector. The&#13;
proposed Ghazi Barotha Hydropower Project (GBHP) will produce electricity at a lower cost&#13;
than the available alternatives, (see Chapter 8). The option of inviting the private sector to&#13;
implement GBHP on a BOO/BOT basis was reviewed during the final preparation stage.&#13;
However, for reasons explained in para. 4.4, it was concluded that this would not be feasible. The&#13;
Bank has been closely involved in Pakistan's power sector reforms and has supported these&#13;
reforms through adjustment operations, regular investment loans for public sector projects and&#13;
loans and guarantees for private sector generating projects. Bank support for Ghazi Barotha is&#13;
linked with further progress on the power sector reform program. Thus, the proposed operation&#13;
is consistent with the Bank's lending policy in the sector.&#13;
Institutional Settin2&#13;
1.7   The responsibility for the energy sector is shared by four ministries: the Ministry of&#13;
Petroleum and Natural Resources (MPNR), the Ministry of Planning and Development, the&#13;
Ministry of Water and Power (MWP), and the Ministry of Production (MOP). A high-level&#13;
Cabinet Committee on Energy (CCE), chaired by the Prime Minister, is responsible for the review&#13;
and approval of all plans, policies and projects in the energy sector, while the implementation of&#13;
the approved projects is assigned to the respective ministries and entities. An Energy Review&#13;
Group provides coordination among the entities and ministries and monitors the progress of&#13;
ongoing projects, programs, policy actions and issues. In addition, the Environment and Urban&#13;
Affairs Division (EUAD), Ministry of Environment and Urban Affairs, is responsible for&#13;
formulating and monitoring the implementation of GOP's environmental policies, including those&#13;
for the energy sector&#13;
1.8   The management of day-to-day operations in the energy sector is vested in a number of&#13;
public and private sector entities. The public sector entities are: (a) the Water and Power&#13;
Development Authority (WAPDA), which is responsible for developing Pakistan's water&#13;
resources and for the construction, operation and maintenance of power generation, transmission&#13;
and distribution facilities throughout the country, except the Karachi area; (b) the Oil and Gas&#13;
Development Corporation (OGDC) for exploration and development of oil and gas; (c) the&#13;
Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation, for the exploration and development of mineral&#13;
resources; and (d) the State Petroleum Refining and Petrochemical Corporation which owns the&#13;
National Refinery Limited (NRL), for processing crude oil. Also involved in the energy sector are&#13;
a number of semi-autonomous entities in which GOP has a controlling interest either directly or&#13;
through public institutions. These are: (a) Karachi Electric Supply Corporation (KESC), which is&#13;
responsible for the construction, operation and maintenance of power generation, transmission&#13;
and distribution facilities in the Karachi area; (b) Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Limited (SNGPL) and&#13;
Sui Southern Gas Corporation (SSGC), responsible for the transmission and distribution of&#13;
natural gas and which are in the process of being privatized; (c) two independent gas transmission&#13;
networks which supply natural gas to WAPDA's Guddu power station and to three fertilizer&#13;
plants; and (d) Pakistan State Oil Limited (PSO) responsible for marketing and distribution of&#13;
petroleum products. Private sector entities include a large number of Pakistani coal mining&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
companies; two refineries; two companies for marketing and distribution of petroleum products,&#13;
and a number of oil and gas development companies. MWP has jurisdiction over WAPDA and&#13;
KESC, and MOP over NRL and Pakistan Refinery Ltd. (PRL). All other operational entities&#13;
(public and semi-autonomous) are under the jurisdiction of MPNR. The list of private sector&#13;
entities will be enlarged starting June 1996 by private power generation companies which are in&#13;
the process of implementing their respective facilities.&#13;
Institutional Development&#13;
1.9   The 1994 Policies call for a redefinition of the role of the public sector in the energy&#13;
sector. Through the restructuring and privatization of the main public sector entities, and the&#13;
establishment of a transparent regulatory framework, the Government's role will be reduced. As&#13;
policy maker, the Government will be primarily responsible for monitoring the development of the&#13;
sector and, if necessary, introduce the corrective measures required to set the sector on its growth&#13;
path. Thus, under the 1994 Petroleum Policy, GOP would create a holding company to handle&#13;
the Government's participating interests in concessions so as to better separate the regulatory and&#13;
ownership functions of GOP. Furthermore, GOP announced that it would privatize OGDC,&#13;
SNGPL, SSGC, and the Pak-Arab Refinery, Ltd. Progress is being made and it is expected that&#13;
SNGPL and SSGC would be privatized by June 30, 1996. Plans for the privatization of OGDC&#13;
and the other petroleum entities in the public sector are actively being pursued. The institutional&#13;
development aspects of the power sector is discussed in Chapter 2.&#13;
Ener2v Resource Endowment&#13;
1.10  Pakistan's commercially exploitable energy resources consist of hydropower, natural gas,&#13;
oil and coal. In addition, the country has a large base of traditional fuels in the form of fuelwood&#13;
and agricultural and animal waste, which provide a major share of rural consumers' energy needs.&#13;
Despite its endowment of energy resources, Pakistan's dependence on energy imports has been&#13;
higher than envisaged by GOP in the previous five-year plans, principally due to financial and&#13;
implementation constraints.&#13;
1.11  The hydropower potential in Pakistan is estimated at about 27,000 MW under average&#13;
hydrological conditions. As of December 1994, only about 4,825 MW (18%) of this capacity was&#13;
developed or committed. A large number of medium and large sized hydroelectric projects have&#13;
been proposed and studied to varying levels of detail. In particular, detailed engineering studies&#13;
have been completed for Kalabagh hydropower project (3,600 MW), while steps are being taken&#13;
to initiate the feasibility study for Basha hydro project (3,300 MW). Kalabagh studies were&#13;
completed in 1985. However, the project could not be processed further because of provincial&#13;
differences, its very large financing requirement, and the wide scope of its environmental and&#13;
resettlement impacts. With the assistance of GTZ (the German Agency for Technical&#13;
Cooperation), preparatory work has been initiated for the identification and feasibility studies of&#13;
several medium-size hydel projects in the northern part of the country; these schemes have been&#13;
analyzed in para 8.12.&#13;
1.12  In the oil subsector, the remaining recoverable reserves amount to about 27 million tons of&#13;
oil equivalent (TOE) as against the original estimate of 64.5 million TOE. Pakistan's major oil&#13;
fields (Dhurnal, Dhulian, Balkassar and Meyal) have largely been exploited, with domestic oil&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
production having increased from 39,300 barrels of oil per day (BOPD) in FY86 to about 57,000&#13;
BOPD in FY94, resulting in a reserves to production ratio of only nine years. With a view to&#13;
improve the incentives for additional exploration activity, and offset the declining reserves to&#13;
production ratio, the package of reforms announced in the 1994 Petroleum Policy (para 1.3)&#13;
includes more expeditious procedures for awarding exploration licenses, the elimination of the&#13;
discount mechanism for producer price of oil, and the deferment of duties on imported equipment&#13;
for exploration activities to the production phase.&#13;
1.13  Pakistan has proven recoverable gas reserves estimated at 23 trillion cubic feet (TCF)&#13;
(including 0.3 TCF of associated gas reserves) of which 9.6 TCF were discovered during the last&#13;
5 years, mainly through the new fields at Qadirpur (3.9 TCF) and Kadanwari (1 TCF). The&#13;
Kadanwari gas field came on stream in May 1995 with an initial production of 80 MMCFD of&#13;
gas. Over the same period, gas production has also increased from about 1.0 billion cubic feet per&#13;
day (BCFD) in FY86 to about 1.7 BCFD in FY94. Despite the recent discoveries, gas&#13;
exploration has proceeded at a slower rate of development than the resources warrant, in part due&#13;
to the generally limited interest by the oil industry in gas exploration. To address this issue, the&#13;
1994 Petroleum Policy, in addition to the above-mentioned reforms common for oil and gas,&#13;
introduces additional incentives for enhancing gas exploration and development.&#13;
1.14  Domestic proven reserves of coal and lignite in established fields are estimated at about&#13;
600 million tons, of which about 360 million tons are recoverable; in addition, reserves amounting&#13;
to 475 million tons (of which about 285 million tons are recoverable) have been confirmed at the&#13;
recently discovered Thar coal field in the lower part of Sindh. However, the economic viability of&#13;
coal production from the Thar deposits still remain to be established. The quality of domestic&#13;
coal is generally poor, requiring fluidized-bed technology if utilized for power generation. Thus,&#13;
in FY94, production was only 3.5 million tons, of which 43,600 tons were used for generating&#13;
about 44 GWh of electricity.&#13;
1.15  In addition to hydropower (para 1.11), most of the balance of the renewable energy is&#13;
obtained by direct burning of biomass, while the use of solar energy and biogas remains&#13;
insignificant.  Given that the household sector accounts for over 80%  of the biomass&#13;
consumption, and in face of the rapid increase of the population, a greater pressure on the already&#13;
dwindling stock of the country's forest resources as well as other forms of biomass is expected.&#13;
Reliable statistics on the use of renewable energy have been developed under the recently&#13;
completed Household Energy Strategy Study carried out by GOP in collaboration with the&#13;
Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP).&#13;
EnerLv Demand and Supplv&#13;
1.16  Pakistan's consumption of commercial energy increased between FY83 and FY94 at an&#13;
average annual rate of about 6.1%, from 11.3 million TOE to 20.4 million TOE. This was due&#13;
mainly to: (a) the growth of the economy of 5.7% p.a.; (b) increasing access to commercial&#13;
energy resources by the population; (c) the modernization of the agriculture activities; and (d) the&#13;
increasing pace of industrialization (industrial production increased during the period at 7.1% p.a.,&#13;
compared to 3.8% p.a. of the agriculture sector). In FY94, the pattern of commercial energy&#13;
consumption was: 38.8% industrial, 33.1% transport, 18.6% residential, 3.9% agriculture, 6%&#13;
others, as shown in Figure la below:&#13;

1.17 Due to supply constraints, the share of gas in Pakistan's primary energy balance fell from&#13;
43.6% in FY83 to 37.8% in FY94. Over the same period, hydropower generation and coal&#13;
production roughly maintained their shares and, consequently, the consumption of oil and&#13;
petroleum products grew rapidly and their share expanded from 34.1% to 40.9%. However,&#13;
despite the sharp rise in domestic crude production (17.7% p.a.) three-quarters of the increased&#13;
consumption of crude oil and petroleum products were met through imports. Because of&#13;
inadequate incentives, domestic refinery capacity expanded only slowly and the bulk of fuel&#13;
imports were in the form of refined products. The Energy Balance for FY94 is presented in&#13;
Annex 1.1.&#13;
Enerzv Demand Forecast&#13;
1.18 The forecast of unconstrained commercial energy demand (recently finalized by the&#13;
Energy Wing in the Ministry of Planning and Development in collaboration with the Bank), calls&#13;
for an annual increase of about 6.7% up to FY2008. The forecast is based on a regression&#13;
analysis of past consumption trends and relationships, and assumes the implementation of an&#13;
aggressive program of energy conservation and efficiency. These projections are also in line with&#13;
recent trends towards decreasing overall elasticity of energy consumption to econornic growth&#13;
from 1.10 in the period FY83-93 to 1.03 between FY93-2008.&#13;
Enerev Supply Forecast&#13;
1.19  In order to meet the projected demand at least cost, the supply of domestic energy&#13;
resources is forecast to increase in absolute terms (although its share in total energy supply is&#13;
expected to decrease from 68% in FY93 to about 62% in FY2003). However, despite the&#13;
implementation of the proposed project, the share of hydro-electricity in total energy supply&#13;
would decline from the present level of 15% to 12% in FY2003. The share of the largely&#13;
imported oil and petroleum products is expected to rise from the present level of 34% to 44% of&#13;
total energy supply in FY2003. This share could be reduced by substantially expanding the supply&#13;
of gas either through development of new gas fields, and matching investments in the pipeline&#13;
infrastructure, or gas imports by pipeline. Studies to determine the most economical options for&#13;
increasing the supply of gas has been recently completed by ESMAP and in the Energy Options&#13;
Study (para 1.28). These studies concluded that the likely gas supply shortfall in the country&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
could be sufficient to absorb economic supplies of natural gas which may be made available from&#13;
increased levels of domestic production in the short to medium term, and from a major gas&#13;
importation project in the longer term. In the absence of such an increase in supply, the share of&#13;
gas may decline from 38% to as little as 24%. Under this assumption, the share of imported&#13;
petroleum products in total energy supply would further increase from its current level of 34% in&#13;
FY94 to 58% in FY2003, to substitute mainly for the use of natural gas in thermal power&#13;
generation, and in the industrial sector.&#13;
Enerfy Prices&#13;
1.20 The Government has been gradually liberalizing energy prices, and generally moving&#13;
towards more market-oriented and transparent pricing regimes. The 1994 Petroleum Policy&#13;
introduced a more attractive market-based reference price for determining the domestic producer&#13;
price of natural gas, and eliminated the discretionary discount applied by GOP on the border price&#13;
of crude, for determining the producer price of domestically produced crude oil. These reforms&#13;
have also rectified other anomalies in the producer pricing formula. As a result, producer prices&#13;
for domestically produced crude continue to be pegged to international prices of crude, while the&#13;
natural gas producer price is now indexed to the international price of a basket of crude oil.&#13;
Refinery prices are directly linked to international market prices.&#13;
1.21  Consumer prices of petroleum products and natural gas have been periodically adjusted in&#13;
line with movements in world market prices. As a result of the price increase of 5% introduced in&#13;
the FY96 budget, consumer prices for petroleum products, with the exception of fuel oil, are&#13;
currently at or above the corresponding import prices, adjusted for inland transportation and&#13;
distribution margins (see Annex 1.2). On average, during FYs88-95, prices of motor gasoline&#13;
have been raised by about 10% per annum, kerosene 11% per annum, diesel 7.8% per annum, and&#13;
fuel oil 6% per annum. Consumer prices of natural gas were also increased by about 25% as part&#13;
of the FY96 budget. As a result, gas prices for the general industry, cement, power (including&#13;
raw gas tariffs) and commercial sectors are at parity or above the domestic price of fuel oil.&#13;
Despite their recent increase, gas tariffs for residential consumers are at about 80% of the border&#13;
price of fuel oil, due to the upward trend in international prices. Natural gas prices have been&#13;
raised by 8.6% per annum for industrial and commercial sectors, about 12% per annum for the&#13;
high consumption slabs of residential consumers, and 6.5% per annum for the low consumption&#13;
residential slab during the same period. Annexes 1.3 give a detailed breakdown of gas tariffs&#13;
compared to domestic and international prices of fuel oil. Electricity tariffs including the Fuel&#13;
Adjustment Surcharge have been increased regularly, to enable WAPDA to finance at least 40%&#13;
of its average investment program through internal cash generation. As a result, the average&#13;
electricity tariff has risen from about Rs 0.64/kWh in FY85, to Rs 2.24/kWh in FY96 (para 2.18).&#13;
Environment and Ener2 Conservation&#13;
1.22  Responsibility for environmental protection in the energy sector in Pakistan is vested in the&#13;
Environment and Urban Affairs Division (EUAD).  The framework for the country's&#13;
environmental protection was established in 1983, when the Pakistan Environmental Protection&#13;
Ordinance was promulgated. Subsequently, EUAD prepared guidelines for environmental impact&#13;
statements for energy-producing activities, and has notified the standards for protection against&#13;
air and water pollution. The Ministry of Labor is developing improved health, safety and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
emergency management standards for surface and underground coal mining activities.  In&#13;
addition, programs to strengthen the environmental management capabilities of OGDC and&#13;
WAPDA are being supported through existing Bank operations.' The Directorate General,&#13;
Petroleum Concessions in the MPNR is preparing, with Bank assistance, guidelines for&#13;
environmental management and operational safety for petroleum exploration and production in&#13;
the country. These efforts will be continued under the proposed project and with the assistance of&#13;
the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).&#13;
1.23  In 1992, the Government approved a comprehensive National Conservation Strategy&#13;
(NCS)2, prepared with the assistance of CIDA, UNDP and the International Union for&#13;
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). The NCS sets out the Government's&#13;
priority objectives and plans for promoting effective environmental and natural resource&#13;
management. The NCS proposes to achieve these objectives through a broad-based program&#13;
which is directed towards encouraging greater public participation in development and&#13;
environmental management; merging environment and economic decision making; and promoting&#13;
sustainable improvements in the quality of life.&#13;
1.24   As regards energy conservation, the National Energy Conservation Center (ENERCON)&#13;
has, in accordance with its mandate, initiated information and outreach programs for enhancing&#13;
awareness about energy conservation prospects; assisted in policy formulation and planning;&#13;
developed investment projects and proposals for the promotion of energy conservation activities;&#13;
and implemented pilot programs aimed at demonstrating the viability and benefits of such&#13;
activities.   The major activities completed to date include: (a) a draft National Energy&#13;
Conservation Law and a National Building Energy Code; (b) detailed energy audits for 59 large&#13;
industrial plants which have identified possible savings of 22% on average; (c) pilot tune-up&#13;
programs for industrial boilers and automobiles, and retrofitting of tubewells; and (d) training&#13;
programs for private and public sector managers, engineers and technicians. A proposed Energy&#13;
Efficiency and Conservation Project, tentatively scheduled for FY97, would focus on the&#13;
implementation of a comprehensive demand-side management program and activities in energy&#13;
efficiency and conservation.&#13;

centrally, the main entities are publicly owned, the prices are set by administrative fiat, and the&#13;
key concern is to expand supply, to a situation where the Government focuses on policy&#13;
formulation, private sector owns most of the assets and operates within a transparent regulatory&#13;
framework, most prices are set by competitive market forces, and proper incentives are provided&#13;
for energy conservation and development of domestic energy resources. The concrete actions to&#13;
implement this vision - most of which are already underway - include: (a) accelerate the ongoing&#13;
restructuring and privatization of WAPDA, (b) complete the already initiated privatization of&#13;
KESC, SNGPL, and SSGC, (c) extend the privatization program to the other major parastatals in&#13;
the energy sector, i.e., PSO, OGDC and NRL; (d) further increase private sector involvement in&#13;
power generation and transmission, oil and gas exploration, production and distribution through&#13;
an internationally-competitive package for attracting local and foreign investors; (e) enhance&#13;
domestic resource mobilization for energy projects through further capital market reforms; (f)&#13;
establish a transparent regulatory framework for the power sector as well as the petroleum sector;&#13;
(g) restrain energy demand growth, by introducing incentives for energy conservation; (h) reduce&#13;
losses in transmission and distribution; (i) further develop domestic energy resources at least-cost;&#13;
and (j) improve the operational efficiency of the energy enterprises that will remain in the public&#13;
sector.&#13;
1.26   The Bank's Assistance Strategy is geared to supporting the Government's strategy outlined&#13;
above and is fully consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) being discussed along&#13;
with this project. In particular, the Bank's strategy is to pursue the "unbundling" of various&#13;
energy sub-sectors in order to maximize competition and to bring in private sector management&#13;
skills and financing. This strategy comprises six basic elements:&#13;
(a)    provide direct support for the privatization of the key utilities (with emphasis&#13;
placed on creation of competitive market structures where feasible);&#13;
(b)    encourage the mobilization of private sector resources through Bank lending and&#13;
guarantees for energy and other infrastructure projects;&#13;
(c)    establish appropriate - and stable - regulatory frameworks to both reduce risks for&#13;
private operators and protect the consumers against potential monopolistic&#13;
practices by private operators;&#13;
(d)   rationalize pricing structures to enhance resource mobilization and ensure that the&#13;
final costs of providing appropriate incentives to private firms is borne by the&#13;
consumers and not funded through the Government's budget;&#13;
(e)    continue institutional and financial support for the key agencies that will remain in&#13;
the public sector; and&#13;
(f)    help create and implement a consistent institutional and incentive framework for&#13;
promoting energy conservation and use of alternative energy resources.&#13;
1.27   Since the mid-1980s, the Bank has been deeply involved in Pakistan's energy sector&#13;
reforms through both policy advice and lending. The Bank was instrumental in developing the&#13;
legal and institutional framework for private investments in generation and transmission, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
is strongly supporting the creation of NEPRA and the divestiture of WAPDA's thermal&#13;
generation and distribution facilities. Past lending aimed also at improving economic efficiency&#13;
and financial sustainability in the sector by encouraging least-cost planning and tariff setting to&#13;
provide adequate levels of self-financing, ensuring compliance with international environment&#13;
standards and strengthening implementation capability. The Bank's future lending program will&#13;
further develop and enhance economic efficiency and the participation of private investors. The&#13;
proposed Energy Efficiency and Conservation Project would strengthen Pakistan's demand-side&#13;
management and energy conservation program (para 1.24). A proposed Hydrocracker Project to&#13;
increase production of high-value petroleum products is being developed by a joint venture in&#13;
which the private sector holds the controlling interest. Other projects would support additional&#13;
private sector investments and the restructuring and privatization of public sector enterprises,&#13;
including the Bank's proposed guarantee for the Uch Power Company, and the planned Third&#13;
Private Sector Energy Development Project. To complement private sector investment in energy&#13;
projects, long-term domestic resources need to be made available in the sector. To this end, the&#13;
Bank is executing a study to review long-term domestic resource mobilization options and capital&#13;
market reforms (para 7.5). Finally, the proposed project is consistent with the Government's&#13;
policy framework for the sector, which envisages decentralization and deregulation of operational&#13;
responsibilities, improvement of efficiency, and development of domestic energy resources at&#13;
least-cost to reduce shortfalls of energy supply.&#13;
1.28  The Bank has also assisted the Government in (a) identifying the expected shortfall&#13;
between energy demand and supply, and evaluating the options available to GOP for enhancing&#13;
supplies; (b) assessing the effectiveness of the Government's strategy for promoting the necessary&#13;
levels of investments; and (c) outlining the remaining agenda of policy reforms which would&#13;
complement the ongoing reform program, and set the energy sector on the required growth path.&#13;
An Energy Options Study,' concluded that energy demand growth is expected to remain strong -&#13;
about 7% per annum between 1994-2018, and ensuring adequate expansion of energy supplies&#13;
will entail substantially higher levels of investments than in the past. In order to ensure adequate&#13;
investments for expanding energy supplies, while at the same time maintaining macroeconomic&#13;
stability, a number of policy responses should be considered by the Government: (a) more&#13;
aggressive efforts to curtail demand growth through appropriate price increases (aimed at raising&#13;
the level of energy prices while reducing cross-subsidies for residential and agricultural&#13;
consumers), and the elimination of tax exemptions; the latter would also mobilize additional&#13;
resources for investments in the energy sector; (b) introduction of more state-of-the-art&#13;
operations, maintenance and management practices to enhance the operational performance and&#13;
efficiency of existing assets; (c) better phasing of the required investments so as to mitigate their&#13;
adverse fiscal and balance of payments effects; and (d) targeting of the increased energy supplies&#13;
largely towards the productive sectors, particularly export-oriented activities, in order to ensure&#13;
sustainability in the balance of payments and prevent a deterioration in creditworthiness ratios.&#13;
The proposed project will assist GOP in achieving some of these policy measures.&#13;

2.   THE POWER SUBSECTOR&#13;
Back2round&#13;
2.1   The responsibility for power supply in Pakistan is currently shared between WAPDA and&#13;
KESC   WAPDA supplies power to the whole country except the Karachi area, which is served&#13;
by KESC. The WAPDA and KESC systems are integrated through a 220-kV double circuit&#13;
transmission line. As of December 1994, the power system included 10,675 MW of generating&#13;
capacity in the WAPDA system (of which 4825 MW is hydel), 1738 MW generating capacity&#13;
under KESC (all thermal), and a nuclear power plant (137 MW) connected to the KESC system.&#13;
The system serves about 10 million consumers, in the following main categories: about 7.9 million&#13;
residential, 1.5 million commercial, 200 thousand industrial, and about 160 thousand agricultural&#13;
consumers. WAPDA accounts for about 84% of the total installed capacity of 12,550 MW, while&#13;
supplying about 80% of the country's electricity consumption. A description of the existing&#13;
WAPDA system is provided in para 3.10.&#13;
Power Sector Reforms - Recent Developments&#13;
2.2   As indicated earlier, GOP has been pursuing a far-reaching privatization and reform&#13;
program for the power sector. Initiated in 1988, with the 1,292 MW Hub Power Project under a&#13;
BOO scheme, GOP's commitment to the reform policy was further strengthened in July 1992&#13;
with the approval of the Strategic Plan for the Privatization of the Pakistan Power Sector. In&#13;
March 1994 and 1995, the reform program was strengthened with the announcement of a new&#13;
policy framework providing internationally attractive incentives for private investors in thermal&#13;
power generation, and in hydropower generation off the Indus River and 500 kV transmission&#13;
lines. The Bank is assisting GOP in implementing this reform program through policy advice and&#13;
three operations: the Private Sector Energy Development Projects (PSEDP) I and II approved in&#13;
1988 and 1994 (Ln. 2982-PAK and Ln. 3812-PAK), and the Power Sector Development Project&#13;
(PSDP) (Ln. 3764-PAK) approved in June 1994. The proposed project will further enhance&#13;
Bank's assistance in this reform program.&#13;
2.3   The Strategic Plan envisages a gradual transition of the power system from integrated,&#13;
state owned utilities to a decentralized system with substantial private ownership and&#13;
management, and reflecting a commercial and competitive operating environment. In particular,&#13;
WAPDA would be reorganized as a holding company with independent subsidiaries for the&#13;
thermal and hydel generation, transmission and despatch, and distribution operations.  The&#13;
thermal and distribution subsidiaries would be gradually offered for sale to the private sector.&#13;
Each subsidiary would be established as a company under the 1984 Companies Ordinance, with&#13;
its own Board of Directors and management; preparation of independent year-end financial&#13;
statements, evaluation of management performance, and accountability to owners/shareholders.&#13;
At the same time, new thermal projects would be implemented only by the private sector. The&#13;
power system, upon completion of the transition, would thus comprise a number of privately-&#13;
I     Private power generation will enter into the system starting June 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
owned generation companies operating under free market competition; an independent, regulated&#13;
transmission and despatch entity responsible for the integrated operation of the system and for the&#13;
wholesale power market; publicly-owned, corporatized entities for the operation of multipurpose&#13;
hydel facilities; and private companies responsible for supplying electricity to the final consumers,&#13;
including socially desirable subsidized services, with GOP bearing the cost of such services&#13;
through transparent and explicit transfers from the budget. The Strategic Plan also provides for&#13;
the establishment of an independent National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) to&#13;
set standards and regulate a gradually privately-operated power sector. The PSDP is assisting&#13;
GOP and WAPDA in setting the stage for this gradual restructuring and privatization program.&#13;
2.4    While the Strategic Plan deals mainly with the restructuring and privatization of WAPDA&#13;
(the dominant public utility in the sector), the March 1994 and 1995 policy frameworks are&#13;
oriented towards implementation of new power generation and transmission system under&#13;
BOO/BOM schemes in the private sector. These policies provide attractive incentives to private&#13;
investors and establish a streamlined "one window" approval process, based on the experiences&#13;
gained through the prolonged process of negotiations preceding financial closure of the Hub&#13;
Power Project. Box 1 presents a summary of the Incentives Package.&#13;
Incentives for Private Power Generation Proiects in Pakistan&#13;
|   Bulk tariff of US cents 6.5/kWh (to be paid in Pakistan Rupees) for the sale of electricity to&#13;
WAPDA/KESC, with indexation mechanism for fuel prices, US and Pakistani inflation, exchange rate&#13;
fluctuations, 0 &amp; M costs, etc.&#13;
*  Fiscal incentives consisting of exemption from corporate income tax, customs duties, sales tax, lqra,&#13;
and other surcharges on imported equipment.&#13;
*  Standardized security package which includes a model Implementation Agreement, Power Purchase&#13;
Agreement and Fuel Supply Agreement.&#13;
* Creation of a Private Power and Infrastructure Board, so as to facilitate a one-window operation.&#13;
*  Fiscal incentive to facilitate the creation of a corporate securities market in the country, including&#13;
permission for power generation companies to issue corporate bonds and shares at discounted prices,&#13;
and establishment of an independent rating agency.&#13;
2.5    Major actions taken todate by GOP and WAPDA towards the implementation of the&#13;
reform program are summarized below:&#13;
(a)    an amendment to the WAPDA Act was promulgated in April 1994, enabling&#13;
WAPDA to be corporatized and divest selected parts of its assets;&#13;
(b)   following this amendment, the Government finalized in early 1995 and with the&#13;
assistance of a reputable international financial advisory firm, the short list of&#13;
potential investors for the Kot Addu power station (1,600 MW). Bids from those&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
2&#13;
investors are expected shortly.  As a second step, GOP also initiated the due&#13;
diligence required to proceed with the privatization of the 880 MW Jamshoro&#13;
power station, and for the Faisalabad Distribution Area Electricity Board;&#13;
(c)    an Ordinance was promulgated in January 1995 for establishing NEPRA. As&#13;
provided for under the Ordinance, Provincial Governments have been requested to&#13;
submit their nominations for the Members of the Authority3, and the Chairman of&#13;
NEPRA was appointed in September 1995;&#13;
(d)    a tariff policy and administration study which would establish the commercial&#13;
pricing principles for electricity, in support of GOP's privatization strategy, is&#13;
underway, and its recommendations are expected to be formulated by January&#13;
1996 and their implementation thereafter;&#13;
(e)    a  manpower  transition  program   study  is  being  initiated  to  provide&#13;
recommendations which would allow the privatization of the power sector to&#13;
occur in a manner that addresses the concerns of labor and the purchaser,&#13;
(f)   the restructuring program for WAPDA has been launched; accounting systems in&#13;
line with the cost profit centers objective have been designed and their&#13;
implementation initiated; and the process of appointing consultants for preparing&#13;
and implementing the corporatization of WAPDA's existing assets started. This&#13;
includes the preparation of the legal framework, management structure along&#13;
cost/profit center lines and staffing plans, as well as computerized management&#13;
information systems (covering, among others, accounting and finance, operations,&#13;
personnel, materials management etc.), and operational and financial performance&#13;
criteria for the corporate entities;&#13;
(g)   the first major private generation project, the 1,292 MW  Hub Power Project is&#13;
under implementation, and the commissioning of the first unit is expected by June&#13;
30, 1996; and&#13;
(h)    as a result of GOP's incentives packages of 1994 and 1995, GOP has received&#13;
proposals exceeding 25,000 MW for new power generation projects and for its&#13;
transmission projects. GOP has so far issued letters of support (LOSs) and is&#13;
negotiating the security packages with sponsors of thirty-four different power&#13;
plants with a potential generating capacity of about 9000 MW. Out of these, five&#13;
projects, with an estimated total installed capacity of about 860MW, have reached&#13;
financial closure, and projects for about 1,000 MW are expected to reach financial&#13;
closure early 1996.&#13;
2     The process of sale of Kot Addu was delayed due to labor issues which have been resolved lately. Financial&#13;
closure is expected by early 1996.&#13;
3     Two out of four Provinces noninated already their Members.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
2.6   The above overall progress on the various aspects of the reform program is encouraging&#13;
and illustrates GOP's commitment. However this reform program will take time to be fully&#13;
implemented, as it has been the case in other reforming countries. While recognizing this fact, and&#13;
putting in place required measures to address the main issues, the need for accelerating the pace&#13;
of its implementation remains critical for an optimal and efficient development of the sector and&#13;
its positive impact on the growth of the economy. The proposed project would assist GOP and&#13;
WAPDA in achieving this objective.&#13;
The Power Market&#13;
2.7   The electricity market has grown at a very rapid pace over the past two decades.&#13;
Consumption of electricity increased from 6,097 GWh in FY73 to 38,218 GWh in FY94, at an&#13;
annual average rate of growth of 9.1%, while real GDP growth rate averaged 5.7% p.a., showing&#13;
an elasticity ratio of 1.6. Over the years, the domestic sector has emerged as a major electricity&#13;
consumer, accounting for 37% of total consumption in FY94, compared to 11.7% in FY73,&#13;
together with the industrial sector whose share has declined from 50.1% in FY73 to 39% in&#13;
FY94. During the same period, the agricultural and commercial sectors have decreased their&#13;
share in the overall consumption. The impressive growth of the domestic consumption has been&#13;
caused by a five-fold increase in the number of connected households, equivalent to an average of&#13;
over 380,000 new customers per year. Despite this progress, only about half of Pakistan's&#13;
population of about 121 million, have access to electricity service, and the per capita electricity&#13;
consumption (about 300 kWh) remains low both in absolute terms and in comparison with&#13;
countries at a similar level of development.4&#13;
2.8   The country has been experiencing wide-spread power shortages, principally due to&#13;
insufficient power facilities (generation, secondary transmission and distribution systems), coupled&#13;
with variations in hydro flows and irrigation constraints. In FY94, power shortages reached a&#13;
level of about 27% of peak demand (Annex 2.1) and estimates of the overall impact of load-&#13;
shedding on the economy amount to about US$950 million. The proposed project would assist in&#13;
gradually reducing the power supply/demand gap.&#13;
Electricity Demand Forecast&#13;
2.9   The electricity demand forecast through FY2020 has recently been finalized by WAPDA&#13;
and reviewed by the Bank. The forecast is based on a regression analysis of past trends of the&#13;
demand for electricity in Pakistan, and assumes as independent variables (a) the level of income;&#13;
(b) electricity price; (c) price of alternate fuels; and (d) load-shedding. Three scenarios regarding&#13;
macroeconomic performance and income growth were used for the analysis: (a) a High Scenario,&#13;
which assumes full implementation and further deepening of the macroeconomic reform program,&#13;
and is consistent with overall GDP growth of 6.2% per annum up to FY2002 and 7% per annum&#13;
over the FY2002 to FY2020 period; (b) a Base Scenario, assuming a partial, and slower&#13;
implementation of reforms, with a GDP growth of 5.3% and 5.6% per annum over the same&#13;
4     In 1990, the average electricity consumption per capita for the Asia region as a whole, was about 1,235&#13;
kWh.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
periods as above; and (c) a Low Scenario, which is based on little reforms, along with external&#13;
difficulties, and assumes an overall GDP growth rate of 4.5% per annum over the entire period&#13;
(FY94-2020). Because the historic load-shedding estimates were included in the data base, the&#13;
resulting forecast provides a reasonable approximation of unconstrained electricity demand. The&#13;
introduction of load management and conservation measures (Annex 2.2), including a gradual&#13;
increase in the tariffs to move closer to the economic cost of supply, consistent with the&#13;
provisions discussed in para 2.19, was then included in the model.&#13;
2.10  The resulting electricity demand under the Base Scenario is projected to increase at an&#13;
average annual rate of 7.9% over the FY94 to FY2002 period, implying a decline in the level of&#13;
losses from about 23.3% in FY93 to 18.5% by FY2000; and 6.5% over the FY2002 to FY2020&#13;
period. The growth rates become 9.6% and 8.4% for the High Scenario and 5.8% and 4.8% for&#13;
the Low Scenario respectively. Annexes 2.3 and 2.4 summarize historical statistics of WAPDA&#13;
system, and the results of the demand projections respectively.&#13;
Power DeveloDpment Plan&#13;
2.11  In order to meet the electricity requirements estimated under the Base Scenario,&#13;
additional generation capacity of about 9,770 MW needs to be installed in the power system by&#13;
FY2002. As detailed in Annex 2.5, of this installed capacity, 1,830 MW relate to ongoing&#13;
projects in the public sector to be commissioned by FY98, and 1,290 MW is under&#13;
implementation by the private sector for the Hub Power project. Of the remaining 6,650 MW,&#13;
1,450 MW relate to Ghazi Barotha, and 5,200 MW relate to new thermal power plants to be&#13;
implemented by the private sector. Under the Low Scenario, the required additional thermal&#13;
generating capacity by the private sector is 3,100 MW by FY2002, while under the High&#13;
Scenario, it is 7,200 MW. Table 2.1 below summarizes the growth rates and the required private&#13;
generating capacities.&#13;

2.12  As stated in para 2.5, the private sector, has shown an overwhelming response to the&#13;
incentives introduced by the 1994 Policy. In particular, the Government received private sector&#13;
project proposals for about 25,000 MW, and has limited the issuance of letters of support (LOSs)&#13;
to 34 projects for about 9,000 MW. However, given the limited amount of debt financing&#13;
available for Pakistan, the credit ceiling of Export Credit Agencies and multilateral institutions, it&#13;
is likely that only half at most of the projects for which a LOS has been issued will be able to&#13;
materialize. In particular, given the results of a recent assessment of the financial and technical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
strengths of several sponsors, only a few projects amounting to about 1700 MW are expected to&#13;
be commissioned by end-1997.&#13;
2.13  At present, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the required level for thermal&#13;
generation from private plants, with the estimates of additional capacity needed by the year 2002&#13;
ranging from 3,100 MW to 7,200 MW, in addition to the proposed GBHP whose energy is&#13;
significantly less costly than that of private thermal projects (Chapter 8). An over capacity would&#13;
impose a heavy financial cost on WAPDA and its consumers, and strain Pakistan's balance of&#13;
payment situation while an under-capacity would lead to continued high economic costs&#13;
associated with power shortages and load shedding. Thus, it is essential that the Government&#13;
carefully matches the sanctioning of new private power plants with the anticipated growth of&#13;
demand in order to ensure commissioning of the "right amount" of power supply at the "right&#13;
time." Fortunately, thermal power plants have relatively short construction periods (three years&#13;
or less) and new plants can be solicited and approved as the demand forecast is firmed up over&#13;
time. Therefore, during negotiations, the Government agreed to introduce not later than&#13;
December 31, 1996 a set of policies, including an appropriate solicitation mechanism,&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, in order to ensure that the required power supply capacity will be&#13;
implemented in a timely manner (para 9.2).&#13;
2.14  The power sector investment program (including Ghazi Barotha) up to year 2002 would&#13;
amount to about Rs 406 billion, of which Rs 161 billion represents private investments, and Rs&#13;
245 billion represents investments by the public sector (WAPDA and KESC). The level of public&#13;
investments, of which Ghazi Barotha represents about 30%, would rise to an average of Rs 33&#13;
billion per annum during FYs96-98 (when implementation of Ghazi Barotha is at its peak) before&#13;
declining gradually to about Rs 23 billion by FY2002. By contrast, private investments (other&#13;
than for the already-committed Hub Power Project) are expected to escalate from about Rs 24&#13;
billion in FY96 to an average of around Rs 30 billion per annum during FYs98-99.&#13;
Demand-Side Manaeement (DSM)&#13;
2.15 WAPDA, through its Energy and Load Management Cell, and in collaboration with&#13;
ENERCON, is actively pursuing load management measures. They include: non-operation of&#13;
Salinity Control and Reclamation Project (SCARP) tubewells during peak hours, staggering of&#13;
weekly holidays, voluntary 25% reduction of the load by continuous process industries and textile&#13;
mills and stoppage of steel melting furnaces during peak hours. Under the ongoing Rural&#13;
Electrification (RE) Project (Ln. 3148-PAKJCr. 2078-PAK), WAPDA is implementing a program&#13;
among 15,000 tubewells to control and restrict tubewell operations through ripple control, time&#13;
switches and splitting and controlling residential and tubewell load in phases. Also under the RE&#13;
Project, WAPDA has completed the installation of about 280 time-of-day (TOD) meters, and&#13;
plans to procure an additional 1,000 TOD meters for the largest industrial consumers. With the&#13;
assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), a power factor improvement program has&#13;
been initiated by ENERCON in collaboration with WAPDA. In addition, WAPDA conducts&#13;
energy audit reviews in all sectors of the economy, with particular emphasis on the industrial&#13;
sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
2.16  The new energy policy calls for a more aggressive approach to DSM. In particular, the&#13;
following measures are being undertaken: (a) extension of peak/off-peak pricing to the remaining&#13;
industrial consumers, and to large commercial and residential customers, and seasonal shift&#13;
incentives for industrial consumers; (b) restriction of peak supply for agricultural tubewells (no&#13;
supply during evening peak hours) through the ripple control system and extension to residential&#13;
users; (c) introduction of a policy package and fiscal incentives to promote customer preference&#13;
for energy-efficient fluorescent lamps vis-a-vis incandescent lamps; and (d) promulgation of a&#13;
policy package to promote the manufacture and use of energy efficient motors for tubewells,&#13;
pumps and compressors. These measures, depending on the speed at which they would be&#13;
introduced, could reduce peak demand by some 1,000 MW by FY2002. In preparation of the&#13;
proposed Energy Efficiency and Conservation Project (para 1.27), the proposed project would&#13;
assist GOP and WAPDA in assessing the effeztiveness of the ongoing DSM program and, based&#13;
on the lessons learned, outline a program of additional measures and related institutional&#13;
arrangements to ensure effective implementation of an aggressive DSM program in line with&#13;
GOP's policy. Annex 2.6 gives the draft Terms of Reference (TORs) for such a study. During&#13;
negotiations, GOP and WAPDA agreed to appoint consultants not later than December 31,&#13;
1996, to undertake the required DSM study, to complete the study by December 31, 1997, to&#13;
review and agree with the Bank on the recommendations of the study by March 31, 1998, and to&#13;
implement the recommendations so agreed in accordance to a plan satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
(para 9.3).&#13;
Electricity Tariffs&#13;
2.17  Electricity tariffs are proposed by WAPDA and approved by the Govemment.  The&#13;
current tariff structure distinguishes between consumers under the following categories: domestic,&#13;
commercial, industrial, agriculture, bulk consumers and others. Furthermore, tariffs, within each&#13;
category are subdivided according to the level of consumption. Tariffs levied on industrial, some&#13;
bulk and a small number of agricultural consumers are composed of two parts, i.e., the demand&#13;
charge and the energy charge, while the other consumers pay only an energy charge. The&#13;
exceptions to the structure are flat rates paid by: (a) the majority of the agricultural consumers&#13;
(based on the water pump horsepower level); and (b) domestic consumers in the Federally&#13;
Administered Tribal Areas (FATA consumers). All consumers, except those who are charged flat&#13;
rate tariffs, also pay a Fuel Adjustment Surcharge (FAS) equivalent to Ps. 7/kWh for the lowest&#13;
two slabs of domestic consumers, Ps. 1 5/kWh for the next domestic slab, and Ps. 75/kWh for the&#13;
remaining domestic, agriculture, industrial, commercial, and other consumers. FAS is calculated&#13;
on the basis of the average fuel cost incurred in the twelve-month period ending two months prior&#13;
to the month of billing, and allows WAPDA to recover at least 95% of its fuel cost. Finally, all&#13;
consumers pay a hydroelectric surcharge (10.4%) which is collected by WAPDA on behalf of the&#13;
Government for payment of hydroelectric profits to the Provinces (para 7.9). Annex 2.7 gives the&#13;
details on the levels and structure of current tariffs.&#13;
2.18  Since 1985, the level of electricity tariffs has been increased annually to enable WAPDA to&#13;
finance 40% of its investment from internal sources. As a result, average revenue has increased in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
nominal terms from 63.8 paisas/kWh in FY85 to about 224 paisas/kWh5 in FY96, representing&#13;
average increases of about 4% per annum in real terms. Following these increases, the average&#13;
revenue is now about 90% of the long-run marginal cost (LRMC). These increases have been&#13;
used by the Government as an opportunity to gradually reduce cross-subsidies in the tariff&#13;
structure. For example, in the recent tariff increase (July 1995), while overall tariffs were raised&#13;
by an average of 14.5%, domestic tariffs were raised by 21.9%, and flat rate agricultural tariffs&#13;
were raised by 25%. Commercial and industrial tariffs, on the other hand, were increased by only&#13;
13.5% and 10.8% respectively as consumers in these categories already pay tariffs higher than&#13;
their respective LRMC. Furthermore, subsidies for consumer connection for agriculture have&#13;
been eliminated. However, domestic and agricultural tariffs continue to be below their cost of&#13;
supply as detailed in Table 2.2 below.&#13;

Source: WAPDA and Bank estimate.&#13;
2.19       Table 2.2 clearly indicates the need for further rationalization of the tariff structure.&#13;
In particular, the residential and agriculture sector, which account for about 39% and 18% of total&#13;
energy sales respectively, pay an average tariff equivalent to only 57% of WAPDA's average&#13;
revenue and cover only about half of their cost of supply. Although this is a marked improvement&#13;
from the prior tariff increase where residential and agricultural tariffs were 54% of WAPDA's&#13;
average tariffs, there is a need to continue to rationalize the tariff structure. As a first step in&#13;
facilitating the reduction of the level of distortion for flat-rate tubewells, it has been agreed under&#13;
PSDP to include a metered energy charge component on all flat-rate tariffs charged for tubewells.&#13;
Actions are being taken by WAPDA towards this objective. In addition, GOP and WAPDA&#13;
agreed during negotiations, that any future tariff increase required in order for WAPDA to&#13;
comply with its financial covenants will entail a reduction in the level of distortion with higher&#13;
tariff increases for those consumers for whom the average electricity rates are below the overall&#13;
5      Includes the surcharge of 10.4% on electricity consumption collected by WAPDA on behalf of the&#13;
Government for payment of hydroelectric profits (para 7.9).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
average electricity rates than that for consumers for whom electricity tariffs are above the&#13;
overall average electricity tariffs (para 9.3).&#13;
2.20   Finally, in line with its objective to privatize the power sector, GOP has recognized the&#13;
need to revise the pricing regime to make the power sector more efficient and attractive to private&#13;
investors. As a first step, GOP introduced in 1994 a bulk electricity tariff of US¢ 6.5/kWh for&#13;
new private power generators. In addition, under the ongoing PSDP, a study is being carried out&#13;
to develop proposals and an action plan for reforming the retail pricing regime6. In particular, the&#13;
study will develop pricing principles linking the final tariff for each consumer category to the cost&#13;
of supply. The study is near completion and the consultant's recommendations are expected to&#13;
be presented to GOP and the Bank very shortly.&#13;
Government Strategy for the Power Subsector&#13;
2.21   The Government's strategy for the power sector aims at encouraging private sector&#13;
participation on a build-own-operate (BOO), or Build-Own-Maintain (BOM) basis; and&#13;
continuing the process of restructuring and privatizing existing utilities in order to maximize&#13;
competition and bring in private sector management skills. GOP would continue its efforts to&#13;
establish a transparent and autonomous regulatory framework and make it fully operational. The&#13;
package of incentives offered to the private sector would be reviewed to ensure its adequacy for&#13;
attracting additional investments, while at the same time limiting sovereign GOP guarantees to the&#13;
minimum feasible levels, as agreed under the PSEDP-II Project (para 2.2). Ongoing efforts to&#13;
rationalize energy prices, while developing conmmercial operating principles and a competitive&#13;
environment for those enterprises that rerrain in the public sector, would continue.&#13;
2.22   While incentives offered under the 1994 and 1995 Policies need to be adjusted regularly to&#13;
ensure their competitiveness with those offered in other countries in the region, there is a more&#13;
immediate need to review the magnitude and macroeconomic impact of these incentives.&#13;
Specifically, exemptions from corporate income taxes, customs duties, sales tax, and other&#13;
surcharges on imported equipment are provided for private power projects. However, this runs&#13;
counter to the Government's urgent need to expand the tax base, and institute a consistent tax&#13;
policy for all sectors of the economy. Experience worldwide has shown that, provided the level&#13;
of the tariff is appropriate, additional incentives in the form of tax relief are not essential for&#13;
attracting private sector interest. Rationalization of the incentive package, which could involve&#13;
removal of these exemptions, rolling over and capitalizing such taxes, and including these in the&#13;
capital cost component of the tariff, would thus provide additional revenues for the Government,&#13;
while ensuring a uniformity of incentives across sectors. Therefore, during negotiations, GOP&#13;
agreed to review not later than June 30, 1996, the incentives offeredfor private investments in&#13;
the power sector, in particular in the form of exemptions from income and other taxes, and,&#13;
based on such review announce and introduce not later than December 31, 1996, a set of such&#13;
6      Given the decentralization of the power sector envisaged by the Strategic Plan, the study will also develop&#13;
transfer pricing principles for exchange of electricity at the wholesale level between generation and&#13;
transrnission, and transrnission and distribution, which can be effectively regulated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
incentives under which such exemptions will no longer be provided as part of such incentives&#13;
(para 9.2).&#13;
Bank's Assistance Strate2v in the Power Sector&#13;
2.23   The Bank will continue to actively support the Government's new power policies, seek to&#13;
accelerate the reform program and expand the role of the private sector, while financing selected&#13;
investments and improvement of the operational efficiency of the public enterprises. Specifically,&#13;
Bank financing would include environmentally sound and attractive hydropower investments such&#13;
as the proposed project, while pursuing further reforms in sectoral policies including tariffs and&#13;
incentives for private power projects.  Under the PSDP, the Bank is supporting the&#13;
implementation of the Strategic Plan for the power sector which envisages the development of a&#13;
competitive electricity market, restructuring and privatization of the main utilities, and the&#13;
establishment of an independent regulatory agency. In line with the same objective, the Bank&#13;
would seek to leverage its resources through the selective use of guarantees for new private&#13;
projects (such as Uch Power Limited proposed in FY96) in order to mobilize private sector&#13;
resources for the power sector to the maximum extent possible. In addition, the Bank would&#13;
support, under the future Energy Efficiency and Conservation Project, the implementation of a&#13;
more aggressive and comprehensive loss reduction, load management and energy conservation&#13;
program.&#13;
Bank Group's Role in the Enerev Sector and Experience with Past Lending&#13;
2.24  The Bank Group's involvement in Pakistan's energy sector started in 1955, with a loan to&#13;
KESC for the construction of a thermal power station.  Since then, it has assisted in the&#13;
implementation of projects in all energy subsectors. Prior to 1985, the Bank Group had made 16&#13;
loans/credits to Pakistan for energy projects. In the power subsector, the Bank had participated in&#13;
the Indus Basin Development Projects, involving mainly the construction of Tarbela and Mangla&#13;
hydropower projects, and provided a series of four credits/loans to KESC and three to WAPDA.&#13;
In the petroleum subsector, the Bank's involvement included five loans to SNGPL for the&#13;
expansion of the infrastructure for the transmission and distribution of gas, three to OGDC for&#13;
exploration and development of oil and gas and the Refinery Engineering and Energy Efficiency&#13;
Project (Ln. 2218-PAK) for restructuring product output and streamlining existing system. These&#13;
projects have been completed, and the respective Project Completion Reports issued.&#13;
2.25  In 1985, the Bank's strategy for supporting the sector was broadened to address sectoral&#13;
policies in addition to investments. The new approach was intended to address issues that cut&#13;
across the energy subsectors, i.e., power, coal, oil and gas, to ensure that consistency in policies is&#13;
maintained throughout the sector. In addition, the sectoral policies were intended to launch a&#13;
broad program for structural reforms with the principal objectives to: (a) identify key investments&#13;
needed to meet the energy requirements of the economy; (b) remove the distortions in energy&#13;
prices and promote efficient use of energy; (c) strengthen the institutions in the sector to move&#13;
them towards financial and administrative autonomy; and (d) deregulate the sector and create an&#13;
enabling environment for the private sector to assume a greater role in the production and delivery&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
of energy. Two Energy Sector Loans7 were approved to accomplish these goals which provided&#13;
an overall policy framework for the Bank's lending in the energy sector.&#13;
2.26  Since 1985, and in addition to the above mentioned Energy Sector Loans, the Bank has&#13;
provided fourteen loans for the energy sector. These include, WAPDA IV and V (Lns. 2499-&#13;
PAK and 2556-PAK) for the least-cost expansion and reinforcement of the secondary and high&#13;
voltage transmission grid; the Petroleum Exploration Project (Ln. 2351 -PAK) and the Petroleum&#13;
Resource Joint Venture Project (Ln. 2553-PAK) to assist GOP in mobilizing private sector&#13;
involvement in exploration and development of oil and gas; the Kot-Addu Combined-Cycle Power&#13;
Project (Ln. 2698-PAK) to add about 200 MW of generating capacity through the conversion of&#13;
combustion turbines to combined-cycle operation; the Power Plant Efficiency Improvement&#13;
Project (Ln. 2792-PAK) for the rehabilitation of existing power plants and conversion of&#13;
combustion turbines to combined-cycle operation at Kotri and Faisalabad; the Refinery Energy&#13;
Conservation and Modernization Project (Ln. 2842-PAK) for improving energy efficiency at the&#13;
National Refinery Ltd.; the Private Sector Energy Development Project (Ln. 2982-PAK), the first&#13;
of its kind to be approved by the Bank, and which provides for a fund to assist in the financing of&#13;
energy projects sponsored by the private sector; the Transmission Extension and Reinforcement&#13;
Project (Ln. 3147-PAK) to extend WAPDA's transmission grid; the Rural Electrification Project&#13;
(Ln. 3148-PAK/Cr. 2078-PAK) which is the Bank's first operation in Pakistan to support the&#13;
extension of the distribution network in rural areas; the Corporate Restructuring and System&#13;
Expansion Project (Ln. 3252-PAK) which provides for the privatization of SNGPL as well as&#13;
expansion of gas infrastructure; the Domestic Energy Resources Development Project (Ln. 3500-&#13;
PAK), which provides for the development of the country's oil and gas resources; and the Power&#13;
Sector Development Project (Ln. 3764-PAK), which is the first to support the implementation of&#13;
a comprehensive strategy for the privatization of the power subsector in Pakistan and the&#13;
restructuring and privatization of WAPDA; and the most recent Bank operation in the sector, the&#13;
Second Private Sector Energy Development Project (Ln. 3812-PAK), which supports additional&#13;
private investments in power generation and related infrastructure facilities.&#13;
2.27  Overall, the Bank has provided ten credits/loans to WAPDA. The first seven have been&#13;
completed and the remaining projects are being implemented satisfactorily, after some delays in&#13;
start ups. The Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) and the Project Completion Report&#13;
(PCR) for the Third Power Project (Cr. 968-PAK and SAC 39-PAK) were distributed to the&#13;
Executive Directors in April 1989; the PCR for the Fourth WAPDA Project (Ln. 2499-PAK) was&#13;
completed in June 1995; and the PCR for Ln. 2698-PAK was completed in November 1995.&#13;
Implementation Completion Reports for Ln. 2556-PAK and Ln. 2792-PAK are expected to be&#13;
distributed to the Executive Directors during FY96. The completion reports have concluded that&#13;
the projects not only improved electricity supply, but also most of the aspects of WAPDA's&#13;
operations including  administration, technical and financial.   However, despite these&#13;
achievements, the projects were completed two to three years behind schedule because of&#13;
weaknesses in WAPDA's overall management of the projects, delays in procurement (both for&#13;
goods/works, and consultant services) and in the clearance of Project Concept (PC 1) documents,&#13;
7     ESL I - Ln. 2552-PAK. approved 1985, closed 1988;&#13;
ESL II - Ln. 3107-PAK, approved 1989, closed 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
as well as the periodic scarcity of local funds. In order to minimize delays in start-up, the Bank,&#13;
under subsequent operations, has assisted WAPDA in preparing standard bidding documents and&#13;
provided training to its staff in the Bank's procurement procedures and made the approval of&#13;
PC Is as part of the up-front actions required to improve quality at entry. Moreover, through the&#13;
sectoral approach to lending and annual reviews of the investment programs, the Bank has also&#13;
been able to assist in identifying funding requirements for individual projects, mobilizing&#13;
resources, and ensuring that adequate funding is provided in the budgets for high priority projects.&#13;
2.28  The proposed project would be the Bank's eleventh operation with WAPDA. It would&#13;
follow up on the restructuring and privatization program for WAPDA, and would assist GOP and&#13;
WAPDA in reducing the chronic shortages of electricity supply. Lessons learned from previous&#13;
operationis, related mostly to improving the quality at entry, advanced procurement action to&#13;
avoid risk of delays, securinigfullfiniancingfor the Project in a timely manner, and the needfor&#13;
uipfronti actions for dealinzg with enivironmental and resettlement issues, were taken into&#13;
consideration7 in the design atnd preparation of the proposed project. As a result, the PC I for the&#13;
proposed project was approved prior to the Bank's appraisal, and procurement for the main&#13;
packages have been initiated early enough to allow for bids opening and/or award of the main civil&#13;
works contracts prior to Board Presentation, thus minimizing the risk of delays and cost overruns.&#13;
GOP and WAPDA have also learned from previous similar projects,  the importance of&#13;
experienced foreign consultants and expert review panels and, for the proposed project, a strong&#13;
project management team has been put in place and is being assisted by well-reputed joint venture&#13;
of foreign/local consultants and panels of experts. Furthermore, the agreement to set up a Ghazi&#13;
Barotha Hydropower entity, in line with the restructuring and corporatization program of&#13;
WAPDA, would ensure an efficient and independent management and operation of the project.&#13;
2.29  Based on past experience both in Pakistan and Bankwide, the preparation and&#13;
implementation of effective Environmental Management PIlans and Resettlement Action Plans&#13;
have generally suffered from the following weaknesses: (a) lack of public consultation and&#13;
participation; (b) shortage of funds to compensate the affected population in a timely manner; (c)&#13;
failure to assign appropriate trained staff responsible for the implementation of the plans; and (d)&#13;
lack of independent monitoring. These findings have been carefully integrated in the design and&#13;
processing of the proposed project. As a result, an Environmental Resettlement and Review&#13;
Panel (ERP) has been associated with project preparation from the onset; a proactive approach&#13;
for public participation and consultation has been ensured, including the setting up of a Public&#13;
Information Center (PIC) at the project site, sufficient funds for land acquisition and&#13;
compensation are being made available well ahead of the transfer of land to WAPDA; WAPDA's&#13;
Environmental Cell and Project Resettlement Organization are being adequately staffed; and&#13;
external monitoring is being undertaken by ERP, a monitoring consultant, a Ghazi-Barotha&#13;
Development Organization (GBDO), and the Bank's and other major donors' environmental&#13;
specialists.&#13;

3. THE WATER AND POWER DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY&#13;
Organization and Management&#13;
3.1   WAPDA, the beneficiary of the proposed loan, was established in 1958 as a semi-&#13;
autonomous agency to coordinate the development of Pakistan's water and power resources.&#13;
WAPDA's current organization chart is shown in Annex 3.1. It is divided into two largely&#13;
independent "wings," one for power and the other for water. The Power Wing is responsible for&#13;
the planning, construction and operation of power generation, transmission and distribution&#13;
facilities throughout the country, except the Karachi area which is served by KESC. The Water&#13;
Wing is responsible for the overall planning and investigation of water resources, and the design&#13;
and construction of surface and groundwater development projects for the federal and provincial&#13;
governments.&#13;
3.2   WAPDA's governing body, referred to as the "Authority" has been enlarged since 1994,&#13;
and comprises the Chairman, the Secretaries of Finance, Planning, and Water and Power along&#13;
with three Members who are in charge of power, water, and finance, and are designated Member&#13;
Power, Member Water, and Member Finance. The members are appointed by GOP and function&#13;
as chief executives of their respective groups.&#13;
3.3   WAPDA's Power Wing compares favorably with most of the utilities supported by the&#13;
Bank in terms of its financial performance and technical competence. With few exceptions over&#13;
the last decade, WAPDA has consistently met an ambitious cash generation covenant (which&#13;
requires it to finance at least 40% of its investment program from internally generated funds) and&#13;
its return on assets is among the highest among the Bank's borrowers. WAPDA has also&#13;
systematically reduced transmission and distribution losses, and has established a good track&#13;
record in the planning, design and implementation of large projects.&#13;
3.4   Member (Power) is assisted by three Managing Directors, in charge of Distribution,&#13;
Transmission and Grid Stations, and Customer Services respectively, and by General Managers&#13;
responsible for thermal generation, hydro generation, planning, finance, coordination, and system&#13;
control and load despatch. The distribution department is further divided into sections, each&#13;
headed by a General Manager dealing with administration, customer services, management&#13;
services, operations, planning and engineering, and purchasing and inventory control. Although&#13;
WAPDA is highly centralized with respect to decision making, its Distribution Department is&#13;
divided into eight Area Electricity Boards (AEB), which were established in 1981. Each AEB has&#13;
a chairman who is the Chief Engineer for the area and is appointed by WAPDA for a five-year&#13;
term; three full-time members (who are also directors in charge of departments), and three part-&#13;
time members representing local interests, one of whom is normally a representative of the&#13;
Provincial Government. The AEB members are appointed for a period of three years. In addition,&#13;
and in order to coordinate activities related to the restructuring and privatization in the sector,&#13;
WAPDA created a separate department headed by a Managing Director, the WAPDA Power&#13;
Privatization Organization (WPPO).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
3.5   The Water Wing functions under Member (Water). For effective control, the entire&#13;
country is divided into north, central, south and west zones, generally covering the provinces of&#13;
NWFP, Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan, respectively, for execution of Salinity Control and&#13;
Reclamation Projects (SCARP) and surface water development projects. A General Manager is&#13;
responsible for each zone, while chief engineers and project directors implement projects falling&#13;
under regions within the zones. In addition, the Water Wing has a General Manager (Dams and&#13;
Coordination) for construction and operations of dams other than Tarbela, primarily Mangla Dam,&#13;
the Mangla Watershed Management Project, and construction of link canals, barrages/syphon,&#13;
including the Chashma Barrage. Because of the size and importance of these projects, the Water&#13;
Wing has separate General Managers for Tarbela Dam and the Kalabagh/Hydroelectric Projects as&#13;
well as one for the proposed project. The Water Wing also has a Water Resources Planning&#13;
Organization responsible for preparing and reviewing water sector development plans.  The&#13;
Planning Division of the Water Wing, headed by a General Manager, is responsible for all&#13;
planning activities on the water side, including SCARP. To ensure the safety of its dam projects,&#13;
the Water Wing has a separate Dams Safety Organization (DSO) which is responsible for the&#13;
review, analysis and interpretation of performance data collected by the project operation and&#13;
maintenance group to detect any malfunctioning of the units.  The DSO carries out an annual&#13;
inspection of all WAPDA's dams, and is involved in the safety planning of future dam projects.&#13;
3.6   As stated in Chapters 1 and 2, the 1958 WAPDA Act was amended in April 1994 to&#13;
enable WAPDA to be corporatized and divest selected parts of its assets mainly thermal&#13;
generation plants and distribution areas.  As a result, WAPDA will be reorganized and&#13;
corporatized into a holding company with decentralized power generation, transmission and&#13;
distribution subsidiaries operating as discrete autonomous profit centers, and selected parts of its&#13;
assets will be offered for sale to private investors. While actions have been initiated by GOP and&#13;
WAPDA towards achieving these objectives, as agreed under the PSDP, the time required for&#13;
completing the full corporatization of WAPDA, originally set as of December 31, 1997, has been&#13;
reassessed to ensure adequate implementation of the required measures.  Therefore, during&#13;
negotiations WAPDA agreed to complete the full corporatization of WAPDA by December 31,&#13;
1998 (para 9.4).&#13;
3.7   A key objective of the proposed project is to continue to assist GOP and WAPDA in the&#13;
reform program for the power sector. Therefore, to ensure that Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower&#13;
Project (GBHP) will be organized and operated in consistency with WAPDA's restructuring&#13;
program, the technical assistance component of the proposed project will provide financing to&#13;
assist WAPDA in providing GBHP with an organizational structure and management system and&#13;
procedures more adapted to its corporate objectives. TORs for such assistance are provided in&#13;
Annex 3.2. WAPDA agreed during negotiations that a project entity to operate GBHP be set up&#13;
no later than December 31, 1998 consistent with the overall restructuring and corporatization&#13;
program for WAPDA (para 9.4). Moreover and as recommended by the Strategic Plan, the&#13;
transmission and despatch functions should be entrusted to a separate corporatized and regulated&#13;
entity, responsive to the needs of the system. This Transmission and Despatch Entity (TDE),&#13;
initially operating as a corporate subsidiary of the WAPDA Holding Company, would be&#13;
responsible for the integrated operation of the power system and its timely extension and&#13;
reinforcement to connect new generating facilities as well as new customers. This would also&#13;
ensure that the central despatch mechanism is transparent, efficient and non-discriminatory&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
between private and public sources of power generation. Under the Power Sector Development&#13;
Project, WAPDA has already initiated the required study for preparing and implementing the&#13;
corporatization of its existing assets, including its transmission and despatch facilities. One of the&#13;
main objectives of the study is to recommend the optimal organizational structure and&#13;
management system for the TDE. Therefore, during negotiations, GOP and WAPDA agreed to&#13;
inmplenment the recommenidations of such study as agreed with the Bank and that a separate,&#13;
corporatized national transmission and despatch entity be established by December 31, 1998&#13;
(para 9.3).&#13;
3.8   Staffing and Training. WAPDA's management staff is competent and well qualified. In&#13;
1993, WAPDA, including its Water, Power and Finance activities, had about 158,070 employees:&#13;
4,980 engineers, 1080 other professionals, 12,250 technical and other supporting staff, 27,310&#13;
administrative and accounts staff, 70,340 skilled workers and about 39,100 other employees&#13;
including unskilled workers. Most of these employees (85%), are employed in the Power Wing.&#13;
The number of consumers served by WAPDA was about 8.4 million consumers, which&#13;
corresponds to a consumer/employee ratio of about 53.  This ratio is relatively low when&#13;
compared to other developing countries (181 in Indonesia and 99 in Thailand), and it reflects the&#13;
overstaffing mainly in the Distribution Department.  The manpower transition study being&#13;
undertaken under the PSDP, would, in time, lead to an optimization of staffing levels. In the&#13;
meantime, under PSDP, GOP and WAPDA confirmed their commitment to initiate specific&#13;
measures such as a freeze on the hiring of new staff and retraining of staff to enable their&#13;
redeployment, in parallel with the privatization process. This will reduce the number of staff that&#13;
would likely become redundant as a result of privatization prior to implementation of actions to be&#13;
agreed under the manpower transition program study.&#13;
3.9   Training in WAPDA is a separate activity and is well-supported. Each of the main&#13;
functions, i.e., generation, transmission and distribution, operate technical training schools in a&#13;
number of locations, which are efficiently run. There is a management training center at Tarbela&#13;
which provides a comprehensive program to WAPDA's training staff. For training in specialized&#13;
areas, support has been provided to WAPD A by bilateral and multilateral agencies. CIDA has&#13;
provided extensive training to WAPDA's staff in the areas of load forecasting, generation,&#13;
transmission and distribution planning, and in design, construction and operation and maintenance&#13;
of the 500-kV network; USAID in the area of distribution; and the Bank in the areas of&#13;
generation planning, maintenance and spare-parts management, and in financial and commercial&#13;
areas. In addition, CIDA, as part of its ongoing National Power Plan Project, and in coordination&#13;
with the Bank's training program under PSDP, will be providing training to WAPDA's Planning&#13;
Department in DSM and to WAPDA's Environmental Cell.&#13;
WAPDA's Existing Facilities&#13;
3.10  As of December 1994, WAPDA's total installed generating capacity was 10,675 MW.&#13;
About one-third of this capacity (2,917 MW) was commissioned during the last three and a half&#13;
years. The existing generating system consists of 4,825 MW (45%) of hydro capacity and 5,850&#13;
MW (55%) of thermal capacity based mainly on dual-fired power plants, using fuel oil and natural&#13;
gas. WAPDA's primary extra-high voltage (EHV) transmission system consists of about 2,800&#13;
km of 500-kV lines and seven grid stations whose aggregate capacity is about 6,774 MVA. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
secondary transmission grid (STG) consists of about 23,000 km of 220-kV, 132-kV and 66-kV&#13;
lines and 600 grid stations, with a total capacity of about 22,344 MVA. The distribution system&#13;
comprises 310,313 km of 33-kV, I 1-kV and 0.4-kV lines.&#13;
WAPDA's Power Development Program&#13;
3.11  WAPDA's Planning Department is using several computerized planning models, in&#13;
particular the Wien Automatic System Planning Package III (WASP III), to prepare long-term&#13;
development studies and medium-term development programs which are revised once a year,&#13;
using sound methods and procedures for determining the programs to meet electricity demand at&#13;
least cost. During the preparation of the proposed project, further assistance has been provided&#13;
to WAPDA for the use and training of the VALORAGUA model, for the optimal planning and&#13;
operation of the mixed hydro-thermal system.  In coordination with the Energy and Load&#13;
Management Cell and the Distribution Planning, the Planning Department also carries out&#13;
feasibility studies on load management measures.&#13;
3.12  Generation Expansion Program. WAPDA's proposed generation program is consistent&#13;
with GOP's latest policy in the power sector whereby all new thermal power generation projects&#13;
would be undertaken by the private sector, and WAPDA will continue to be responsible for the&#13;
construction and operation of the major hydropower projects. Therefore, the present WAPDA's&#13;
generation program only includes the completion of ongoing thermal and hydropower generation&#13;
projects, and the construction of GBHP.&#13;
3.13  WAPDA's future transmission and distribution program calls for the expansion and&#13;
rehabilitation of the network to connect future load centers at least cost, including the new&#13;
independent power producers (IPPs), and enhance WAPDA's efforts in improving the operating&#13;
efficiency of the power subsector. These programs would allow for increased investments in loss&#13;
reduction, load management, expansion and reinforcement of the network, and the expansion of&#13;
rural electrification.&#13;
3.14  WAPDA's development program for the period FY95-2002, together with the annual&#13;
phasing of expenditures for ongoing and new projects is presented in Annexes 3.3 and 3.4. The&#13;
program which involves expansion in generating capacity, along with parallel expansion of the&#13;
transmission and distribution network, is estimated to cost about Rs. 251.8 billion equivalent to&#13;
about US$ 7.0 billion. This program assumes that implementation of the GBHP would be&#13;
effectively initiated in FY96, with some minor preparatory works in FY95.&#13;
3.15  The Bank has reviewed WAPDA's investment program to ascertain its consistency with&#13;
the macroeconomic and public investment targets of the Government's economic reform program.&#13;
Annex 3.5 presents the details of the assumptions. The results indicate that WAPDA's projected&#13;
investment program over the period 1995-2002 could be accommodated within the&#13;
macroeconomic targets, given the policy of implementing new thermal power generation in the&#13;
private sector, and provided that a sound macroeconomic framework would be maintained. In&#13;
order to ensure that WAPDA's investment program will remain consistent with GOP's agreed&#13;
macroeconomic targets, and avoid crowding out of other GOP's high priority projects, GOP and&#13;
WAPDA agreed during negotiations to repeat under the proposed project the agreement under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
PSDP to review with the Bank before March 31 of each year, WAPDA's rolling investment&#13;
program over a five-year period, covering the current year, the last preceding year and the next&#13;
three following years, with a view to enabling the Bank to satisfy itself that the program remains&#13;
consistent with the Borrower's macroeconomic targets (para 9.5).  In addition, during&#13;
negotiations, GOP antd WAPDA agreed that the GOP's Core Public Sector Development&#13;
Plrogram and the Social Action Program, as discussed and reviewed with the World Bank on an&#13;
annual basis, will not be adversely affected by the fitnancing requirements of GBHP (para 9.2).&#13;
Operational Performance&#13;
3.16  WAPDA operates and maintains its plants and equipment satisfactorily. The level of&#13;
performance in generation operations remains satisfactory, particularly when considered in&#13;
relation to the constraints arising from insufficient power generation capability and shortage of&#13;
supply, fuel availability and quality, spare parts procurement procedures, aging plants requiring&#13;
major overhaul, and financial and implementation constraints for generation development&#13;
programs. This performance is expected to further improve with the actions undertaken under the&#13;
recently completed Power Plant Efficiency Improvement Project (Ln. 2792-PAK) cofinanced by&#13;
the Overseas Development Administration, and which involved station refurbishing, supply of&#13;
spare parts, introduction of a computerized maintenance system, and a technology transfer&#13;
component. In addition, arrangements are being undertaken to ensure additional supply of gas for&#13;
power generation, and for additional combined-cycle units, thus improving the efficiency and&#13;
availability of the generation system in general. Finally, the addition of generation capability to&#13;
the system will allow WAPDA to improve the maintenance program of its power plants, therefore&#13;
improving the availability of these plants.&#13;
3.17  Improvement in WAPDA's operational efficiency is also illustrated by the efforts made in&#13;
reducing the level of its power system losses from 37.6% in 1977, to 24.2% in 1994, with&#13;
transmission and distribution losses amounting to 9% and 12.1% respectively. This has been&#13;
achieved through a continued program of power system reinforcement and rehabilitation.&#13;
However, these losses remain higher than the economically achievable levels of about 3% and 8%&#13;
for transmission and distribution system respectively. The PSDP, the proposed project and the&#13;
loan covenant with ADB for the proposed project would assist WAPDA in enhancing its efforts&#13;
for further loss reduction.&#13;
3.18  The transmission system is designed and constructed to high standards but maintenance is&#13;
made more difficult due to the multiplicity of plants and difficulty of planning the extension of the&#13;
transmission system, due to the location of the generating plants vis-A-vis the load centers.&#13;
Despite the efforts already undertaken, the 132-kV system in particular will require additional&#13;
measures to improve its operational efficiency.  The implementation of the transmission&#13;
component of the PSDP which is proceeding satisfactorily, would assist WAPDA in achieving this&#13;
objective.&#13;
3.19 Until recently, WAPDA's investment programs were geared towards developing the&#13;
generation and the transmission systems, thus limiting the resources for distribution development.&#13;
Moreover, due to pressures to provide new connections, most resources were directed towards&#13;
extending the network and little attention was given to the maintenance and operation of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;
existing distribution system. Recognizing the need to overcome the inefficiencies stemming from&#13;
this situation, and as a follow up to an agreement with the Bank, WAPDA created a distribution&#13;
directorate under arrangements satisfactory to the Bank.  Actions required to enhance the&#13;
operational performance of this department are being continued by WAPDA on the basis of the&#13;
recommendations of a study funded by USAID, and strengthened under the ongoing Rural&#13;
Electrification Project (para 2.26). In order to assist WAPDA in evaluating the progress made, a&#13;
distribution diagnostic study of one AEB would be undertaken under the PSDP. Despite the&#13;
above mentioned improvements in its management and operation over the past several years,&#13;
WAPDA is more required to further streamline its operations in view of the pressure and&#13;
competition of the forthcoming private power generating plants. In line with its restructuring and&#13;
reorganization program, WAPDA needs to strengthen its managerial, technical, and financial&#13;
operations. To this end, during negotiations, WAPDA agreed to appoint, not later than&#13;
September 30, 1996, a management consultant firm with relevant international power utility&#13;
experience and under terms of reference satisfactory to the Board, to assist WAPDA in designing&#13;
and implementitng a set of managerial, financial and technical efficiency objectives by which&#13;
WAPDA would measure and improve the operational, managerial andfinancial performance of&#13;
its power operations (para. 9.4).&#13;
Financial Manazement&#13;
3.20 WAPDA's financial function is headed by a Member Finance, while the day-to-day&#13;
management of the financial function for the power sector is the responsibility of the General&#13;
Manager Finance (Power), assisted by four senior deputy general managers for treasury,&#13;
accounting and control, coordination, and field offices, a director for administration, and four&#13;
senior managers in charge of accounts pertaining to thermal operations, hydro, transmission, and a&#13;
resident representative in Karachi. The financial function was reorganized to: (a) accommodate&#13;
the separation of the Distribution function headed by a Deputy General Manager in charge of&#13;
accounts of all the AEBs; (b) address the problem of an excessive number of senior managers&#13;
reporting to the General Manager Finance (Power); and (c) segregate the complex treasury tasks&#13;
from those of financial management, including debt management WAPDA bonds and accounts&#13;
consolidation and financial planning. The reorganized financial function is resulting in a more&#13;
streamlined operation.&#13;
Financial Improvement Prouram&#13;
3.21  Under the Rural Electrification Project, WAPDA adopted a Financial Management&#13;
Improvement Program aimed at enhancing WAPDA's resource mobilization and financial&#13;
efficiency objectives. Implementation of the program is progressing satisfactorily. Measures to&#13;
increase resources availability included: (a) recovery of tubewell connection costs from consumers&#13;
through a loan program with the Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan; (b) implementation&#13;
of a cost recovery program for rural electrification operations; (c) regular aging of accounts&#13;
receivables to improve collections monitoring; and (d) enhancement of security deposits to reflect&#13;
current average billings. The subsidies for consumer connections including those in the rural&#13;
areas, have been eliminated, and WAPDA now prepares a pro-forma balance sheet and income&#13;
statement for rural electrification to identify the financial costs of this program to WAPDA. The&#13;
regular aging of accounts receivable has resulted in an increase in provision for uncollectible&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
receivables in WAPDA's accounts. In addition, WAPDA is reviewing its accounts receivable&#13;
overdue for more than three years to determine the uncollectible receivables to be adjusted on its&#13;
balance sheet. Institutional measures to improve financial management efficiency have been&#13;
carried out, including the reorganization of the financial function of WAPDA, regular review of&#13;
the adequacy of premiums paid for its self-insurance scheme, and strengthening of WAPDA's&#13;
internal audit functions. To further enhance efficiency, the accounting and financial information&#13;
system of WAPDA is being automated with assistance of international consultants.&#13;
3.22 Accounting System. WAPDA has about 500 accounting units distributed over a wide&#13;
geographical area. To cater to this large number of accounting units, WAPDA has adopted a&#13;
decentralized, accrual-based accounting system. While the system is sound in structure, the utility&#13;
is not deriving full benefits from the system primarily due to: (a) non-availability of trained&#13;
accounting personnel, particularly in the distribution areas; and (b) the manual system of&#13;
maintaining the accounts which causes significant delays in the flow of accounting information&#13;
through WAPDA's hierarchy. To address these concerns, WAPDA is implementing a&#13;
comprehensive training program for the accounting staff of the AEBs, with the assistance of the&#13;
Electricity Supply Board of Ireland. Furthermore, under the Rural Electrification Project, the&#13;
design of the automation of the accounting and financial management information system at&#13;
headquarters has been completed and the computer hardware is being procured. In view of the&#13;
corporate restructuring and privatization initiatives that GOP and WAPDA are pursuing, the&#13;
design of the automated accounting system has been reoriented to accommodate truly&#13;
decentralized accounting based on profit centers (generation plants, transmission, and AEBs). A&#13;
pilot design for one thermal plant, one hydel plant, WAPDA's transmission facilities and interface&#13;
with one AEB system has been completed. To ensure that an automated accounting and finance&#13;
system on a profit center basis is implemented throughout WAPDA, consultants are being&#13;
appointed under the PSDP to implement the program. Completion of WAPDA's automation for&#13;
accounting, finance and a Management Information System program is planned to coincide with&#13;
the corporatization of WAPDA, scheduled to be implemented by December 1998.&#13;
3.23  Management Information System (MIS). The manually-generated information system of&#13;
WAPDA has led to delays in decision-making and cumbersome preparation and storage of data.&#13;
The successful implementation of WAPDA's current corporate restructuring program would have&#13;
to rely on a timely and reliable information flow. Thus, the development of a comprehensive and&#13;
automated MIS covering WAPDA's technical and financial operations is urgently needed. With&#13;
assistance from consultants, an MIS, covering, inter alia, WAPDA's technical and operational&#13;
information requirements would be integrated with the ongoing work being done on the design of&#13;
the automated accounting system. The process for obtaining proposals from consultants for the&#13;
MIS design and implementation has been initiated. In addition, WAPDA has established an MIS&#13;
Development Cell headed by a Director General whose responsibilities include all aspects of&#13;
evaluation, planning, development, testing, maintenance of all financial and information systems&#13;
and computer requirements of WAPDA.&#13;
3.24 External Audit. The responsibility for auditing WAPDA's accounts rests with the Auditor&#13;
General of Pakistan (AG), who discharges this responsibility through a Director General assigned&#13;
to WAPDA Audit on a permanent basis. WAPDA is required by the WAPDA Act to finalize the&#13;
annual accounts and have them audited within six months of the end of the financial year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
However, because of the large number of accounting units scattered throughout the country and&#13;
the manual preparation of accounting data that feeds into the audit, the Audit Report is issued&#13;
some eight to ten months after the end of the financial year. With the improvement envisaged&#13;
through the automation of its accounting and financial information system, WAPDA expects to be&#13;
able to have its finalized annual accounts audited within six months of the end of the financial&#13;
year. Accordingly, the Bank Group's standard audit covenant which is included under all&#13;
ongoing WAPDA Power Projects will be maintained under the proposed project (para 9.5). To&#13;
improve the quality and timeliness of the external audit, WAPDA and the Office of the AG,&#13;
Pakistan have agreed to appoint private auditors to participate in the audit of WAPDA's accounts.&#13;
Under PSDP and as a first step, WAPDA would explore the scope and nature of the audit to be&#13;
done by private auditors in close consultation with the AG. Therefore, WAPDA agreed during&#13;
negotiations to appoint by June 30, 1996, a reputable private auditing firm, in consultation with&#13;
the Auditor General of Pakistan, to develop, by December 31, 1996, a detailed audit plan&#13;
salisfactory to the Bank, and to conduct beginning FY99 the audit of WAPDA's accounts in&#13;
accordance with the agreed audit plan (para 9.4).&#13;
3.25 Insurance. WAPDA insures its assets under a self-insurance scheme established in 1981.&#13;
The scheme covers substations, power houses, machinery and workshops against loss from fire,&#13;
machinery breakdowns, and other calamities. Since the value of WAPDA's assets have been&#13;
increasing, premium rates are regularly monitored based on the most recent twenty year&#13;
experience in claims, and insurance coverage based on replacement value basis has been adopted.&#13;
Since the last actuarial review of WAPDA's self-insurance scheme was done in 1990, a new&#13;
actuarial review should be undertaken to ensure that WAPDA's self-insurance scheme remains&#13;
adequate. Therefore, WAPDA agreed during negotiations to appoint no later than December 31,&#13;
1996, consultants whose qualifications are satisfactory to the Bank, to complete an actuarial&#13;
study for the utility by December 31, 1997 and implement the recommendations by March 31,&#13;
1998 (para 9.4).&#13;

Project Back2round&#13;
4.1    Downstream of the Tarbela dam, the Indus River briefly crosses a broad plain before it&#13;
enters the Attock Gorge. The Indus River drops by about 76 m. in a distance of 63 Km. between&#13;
the tailrace at Tarbela and the confluence of the Indus and Haro Rivers. This topographical&#13;
feature makes it possible to economically utilize the available hydraulic head for power&#13;
generation.&#13;

4.2    A pre-feasibility study initiated by WAPDA in 1986 established that it would be possible&#13;
to divert water near the village of Ghazi downstream of Tarbela and lead it through a canal to&#13;
Gariala where a power station with a capacity of about 1,000 MW could be built. Because of its&#13;
location, this scheme was named Ghazi-Gariala Hydropower Project.&#13;
4.3   In 1989, UNDP agreed to finance the feasibility study and the detailed engineering designs&#13;
for the Ghazi-Gariala Project. The Bank was appointed executing agency. The feasibility and&#13;
design studies were carried out by Pakistan Hydro Consultants (PHC), a joint venture of five&#13;
consulting firms (para 4.6). The planning and design work were, from the onset, guided by an&#13;
Independent Panel of Experts and an Environment and Resettlement Review Panel. Several&#13;
alternatives and redesigns were examined in order to minimize resettlement and environmental&#13;
impacts and to ensure the safety and technical soundness as well as the economic viability of the&#13;
project. As a result of these studies, it was decided to locate the power house near the village of&#13;
Barotha and, at the request of the local residents, the name was changed to the Ghazi-Barotha&#13;
Hydropower Project.&#13;
4.4    Although GOP is pursuing private sector participation in hydro projects in secondary&#13;
tributaries of the Indus River, the public sector, under the Government's policy', will continue to&#13;
1  Strategic Plan for the Privatization of Pakistan Power Sector (1992), and Hydel Policy (1995).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
build, own and operate hydropower projects on the main Indus River. This is due primarily to&#13;
their critical importance for the operation of the Indus Basin's irrigation system and flood control,&#13;
whose benefits are vital to the Pakistan economy. Consequently, from the inception of the&#13;
GBHP, whose operation will be dependent on the water releases from the Tarbela dam, it has&#13;
been envisaged that the project would be implemented by WAPDA. Still, both GOP and the&#13;
Bank seriously examined the possibility of having GBHP owned and operated by the private&#13;
sector. However, it was concluded that this was not a viable option. Private sector lenders are&#13;
generally more reluctant to finance hydropower than thermal generating projects on a BOO/BOT&#13;
basis. This is partly due to the inherently greater construction and operating risks associated with&#13;
hydropower plants due to hydrological and geological uncertainties. Other considerations also&#13;
would make the project unattractive to the private sector: (i) its long gestation period and&#13;
economic life compared to the much shorter repayment period of commercial loans; (ii) its large&#13;
financing requirements, particularly in local currency, coupled with the scarce local resources&#13;
available in the domestic capital market; and (iii) the equity-debt ratio required by the private&#13;
sector in BOO/BOT structure, thereby increasing the overall external borrowing requirement for&#13;
the project.&#13;
Proiect Objectives&#13;
4.5   The main objectives of the proposed project are to assist GOP in its efforts to: (a) develop&#13;
domestic energy resources and reduce load-shedding in a cost effective and environmentally&#13;
sustainable manner, thereby supporting the country's long-term energy development objectives;&#13;
(b) reinforce and complement the reform program for the power sector; (c) strengthen WAPDA's&#13;
capability to address environmental and resettlement issues related to hydropower projects; and&#13;
(d) further rationalize the use of electricity. The proposed project is consistent with an overall&#13;
sectoral approach that includes substantial attention to issues of pricing, demand management,&#13;
environment, resettlement, and redefined roles of the public and private sectors in the energy&#13;
sector.&#13;
Proiect DescriPtion&#13;
4.6   The description of the proposed project is summarized below and detailed in Annex 4.1,&#13;
which also gives the main project data. The geographic locations of the project's physical&#13;
components and the project layout are shown in IBRD Maps 25106 and 25107. Drawings Dl,&#13;
D2 and D3 give the layout and cross section of the barrage, the power channel and the power&#13;
house respectively. The proposed project would consist of:&#13;
(a)   the construction of the Ghazi Barotha Hydropower Project (GBHP) which aims at&#13;
utilizing 76 meters of head available in the Indus River between the tailrace of&#13;
Tarbela power station and its confluence with Haro river, and which comprises the&#13;
following three main components:&#13;
(i)    a barrage and its ancillary works, located near Ghazi village at about 7 km.&#13;
downstream of Tarbela Dam, with a normal pond level of El. 340 m, which&#13;
would have an initial live storage capacity of about 62 M cu m, and would&#13;
allow diurnal re-regulation of the discharge from Tarbela. The barrage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
would include 20 open-flume standard-bays, and 8 undersluices bays, each&#13;
18.3 m wide, with a crest level of El. 332.2 m and 326.0 m respectively; a&#13;
dividing island of about 400 m width acting as two guide banks, one for the&#13;
standard bays, the other for the undersluices and head regulator; a head&#13;
regulator of 8 bays, each of 18.3 m width with a crest at El. 333 m for&#13;
controlling flows, into the power channel, while allowing the pond level to&#13;
fluctuate in response to diurnal variations in flow from Tarbela;&#13;
(ii)   a 52 km long concrete-lined power channel with a capacity of 1,600&#13;
cumecs, and its ancillary works. The power channel would have a bed&#13;
width of about 58.4 meters and a depth of about 9 meters. The concrete&#13;
lining would be 135 mm thick, reinforced and joints with water stops&#13;
would be provided at 9 to 12 m intervals. The underdrainage system is&#13;
designed to maintain groundwater levels below the invert of the channel,&#13;
and would comprise a filter layer under the concrete lining along the bed&#13;
and sides of the power channel. The channel would have a bed slope of&#13;
1:9,600, with a resulting average water velocity of 2.33 m/s. Along the 52&#13;
km length of the canal, there would be 33 bridges for easy access, and 45&#13;
cross drainage structures. For safety reasons, the power channel would be&#13;
fenced in the populated areas; and&#13;
(iii)   a power complex and ancillary works, located near the village of Barotha&#13;
with its tailrace outfalling at the confluence of the Indus and Haro rivers,&#13;
and with an installed generating capacity of 1,450 MW comprising five&#13;
units each of 290 MW. The power complex would generate 6,600 GWh of&#13;
energy annually, would run as a base load station, and would have daily&#13;
peaking capability throughout the year, provided by headpond storage of&#13;
about 25 M cu m, and depending upon water released through Tarbela&#13;
units;&#13;
(iv)  the construction of power transmission facilities to connect GBHP to the&#13;
interconnected grid, involving two 500 kV transmission lines of 100 km&#13;
each, from Barotha to Rewat and related substations, and about 140 km of&#13;
500 kV loop in and out of existing 500 kV Tarbela-Gatti line at Barotha;&#13;
(b)   the Implementation of an Environment and Resettlement Management Plan&#13;

Proeect En2ineering and Preparation&#13;
4.7   GBHP.  As stated earlier, PHC, a joint venture of five consulting firms (National&#13;
Engineering Services Pakistan and Associated Consulting Engineers, both of Pakistan; Ewbank&#13;
Preece, Binnie and Partners, both of UK; Harza Engineering Company, USA), carried out the&#13;
detailed project feasibility, design and preconstruction studies. In accordance with the Bank's&#13;
procedures, an independent Panel of Experts (POE) has been associated with the project&#13;
preparation from the onset. An independent Environment and Resettlement Review Panel (ERP)&#13;
also participated since the beginning of the project preparation process and design in the&#13;
environmental assessment and resettlement studies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
4.8   The proposed project has been the subject of intensive engineering and design studies and&#13;
site investigations executed in several phases. During those studies, several alternatives were&#13;
considered with due consideration to technical, safety, environmental, resettlement and economic&#13;
aspects, mainly with regard to the project size, the barrage site, the power channel size and&#13;
alignment and the siting of the power complex. In particular, five barrage sites were identified,&#13;
several alternative designs for the power channel and its alignment were studied (unlined versus&#13;
concrete-lined, twin channels versus one channel, and alignments into higher and lower ground),&#13;
and five potential power complex sites were considered. This process allowed in particular for&#13;
significant reductions in the potentially adverse environmental, resettlement and archeological&#13;
impacts. The selected site for the barrage was preferred on environmental grounds; the power&#13;
channel alignment and capacity were also selected on environmental, resettlement and safety&#13;
grounds; and the Barotha site for the power complex was selected on environmental and technical&#13;
grounds, as it offered the most favorable topography. Annex 4.2 summarizes the alternatives&#13;
which were considered. The project feasibility study was completed in August 1992, establishing&#13;
the project to be technically sound, economically viable, environmentally sustainable, and socially&#13;
acceptable. This was also endorsed by the POE and the ERP. The project feasibility report is in&#13;
the Project File. The Project Concept document (PC-I) has been approved by the Government.&#13;
4.9   Within the same assignment funded by UNDP and GOP, PHC prepared the detailed&#13;
engineering design of the adopted scheme, and prequalification and bidding documents for the&#13;
preparatory works, and the main civil works contracts for the barrage, the power channel and the&#13;
power complex.  Given the priority and complexity of the project and PHC's excellent&#13;
performance during the feasibility studies and the already completed preparation phase of the&#13;
project, GOP and WAPDA decided to extend the services of PHC to complete the preparation of&#13;
the project, including the procurement process, and to assist in the construction supervision and&#13;
project commissioning (para 5.1). The related TORs have been reviewed by the Bank, found&#13;
satisfactory and are attached in Annex 4.3. While PHC is proceeding with its assignment,&#13;
negotiations between WAPDA and PHC are currently underway for the finalization of the&#13;
contract. Todate, contracts for the preparatory works have been awarded; bid evaluation reports&#13;
for the barrage and the power channel civil works contracts have been reviewed by the respective&#13;
financing agencies, and notification of award expected very shortly; bids for power complex civil&#13;
works contract, the cranes and gates are being evaluated; bidding documents for the turbines and&#13;
generators have been prepared, and are being reviewed by the respective financing agency.&#13;
4.10  Power Evacuation Facilities.  WAPDA's arrangements for planning, engineering and&#13;
supervision of works for the transmission system were reviewed. Load flows and stability studies,&#13;
design criteria and environment and resettlement considerations were the basis for the adopted&#13;
scheme for the evacuation of power from GBHP, and its connection to the grid system. These&#13;
were also reviewed and found satisfactory. Detailed engineering design of the transmission&#13;
component of the proposed project is being carried out jointly by WAPDA's transmission and grid&#13;
stations staff assisted by National Engineering Services Pakistan (NESPAK).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Safety Aspects&#13;
4.11  In accordance with the Bank guidelines for Safety of Dams and Structures (OMS 3.80,&#13;
and the presently revised draft OP/BP 4.37), the project provides appropriate measures to ensure&#13;
the safety of the proposed project and the associated structures.&#13;
4.12  Engineering.  The PHC consortium prepared the project engineering and all detailed&#13;
designs and technical reports with specific consideration of the safety of the project structures.&#13;
4.13  Independent Panels of Experts. As indicated earlier, POE and ERP have been associated&#13;
with the project from the initial stages of the project preparation to carry out a comprehensive&#13;
review of the feasibility study, project layout, and the detailed designs of the project, and to advise&#13;
and ensure the safety of the project and the appurtenant structures, with specific consideration of&#13;
the hydraulic, soil, seismic, structural, environmental and resettlement aspects. POE comprised&#13;
eight internationally reputed experts with relevant expertise in dam/barrage, appurtenant&#13;
structures and power house engineering, concrete lining of major channels and the underdrainage&#13;
systems, and the electrical/mechanical equipment for the power station. ERP comprised three&#13;
internationally recognized experts with relevant expertise in environmental and resettlement&#13;
matters. The Panels contributed some important modifications for the design and implementation&#13;
plan of the project. These Panels are being reconstituted to review, assist and guide on the critical&#13;
technical and safety aspects of the proposed project, and their monitoring during construction and&#13;
initial operation of the project. Related TORs are attached in Annexes 4.4 and 4.5. Most of the&#13;
members of the previous Panels will continue on the reconstituted panels. Nomination of&#13;
members to the Panels is ongoing and expected to be completed early January 1996.&#13;
4.14  Instrumentation. Extensive instrumentation is proposed to be installed at the project&#13;
structures and the concrete lined power channel for safety monitoring. The same would be&#13;
further reviewed by the POE and the Bank for its adequacy when instrumentation designs are&#13;
finalized during construction, and additional instrumentation will be incorporated if considered&#13;
necessary. The proposed instrumentation would provide data for studying the behavior of the&#13;
various project structures and the power channel and foundations after construction, and enable&#13;
the development of protective measures to cope with emergency conditions. Special provisions&#13;
have also been made for monitoring and controlling the accumulation of sediments during project&#13;
construction.&#13;
4.15   Safety Inspections During Operation. Periodic inspections of the dam and hydraulic&#13;
structures will be carried out by WAPDA assisted by suitably qualified experts, acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. WAPDA Dam Safety Organization staff are well trained in dam safety monitoring and&#13;
conducts inspections of dams and major hydraulic structures in the country that generally follow&#13;
the practices of the US Bureau of Reclamation. During negotiations, WAPDA agreed to&#13;
maintain or cause to be maintained all facilities relevant to the project, and for making or&#13;
causing to be made all necessary repairs to those facilities, in accordance with sound&#13;
engineering, financial and power utilities practices (para 9.4).&#13;
&#13;

Project Cost Estimate&#13;
4.16  The total project cost estimate, including physical and price contingencies, local duties and&#13;
taxes is about US$1,863.5 million of which about US$1,192.2 million (64 percent) would be the&#13;
foreign exchange component. The financing required, including interest during construction, is&#13;
estimated at about US$2,250.0 million. The cost estimate is based on June 30, 1995 prices. Land&#13;
acquisition costs are based on the assessed market price including compensation to lessees and&#13;
mortgagees. Their costs have been estimated by preparing detailed bills of quantities for each type&#13;
of work and costing the quantities. Cost estimates for the preparatory works are based on the&#13;
related contracts amount. Cost estimates for the barrage and the power channel are based on the&#13;
evaluated bid of the recommended bidder. All other costs are based either on consultant's&#13;
estimate or on recently opened bids for similar works. Physical contingencies are assumed to be:&#13;
(a) 15% for the barrage, the power channel and the power station civil works because these&#13;
works are of more difficult design and complex nature, and for the transmission lines which are&#13;
being surveyed; (b) 10% for certain mechanical and electrical works (switchyard steel structure,&#13;
cables and accessories, power plant auxiliaries and SCADA equipment). These works comprise&#13;
many components and therefore need larger provision of contingencies than major&#13;
mechanical/electrical works (turbines, generators, transformers, reactors, cranes, HV/MV/LV,&#13;
switchgear, elevators, standby diesels and gates, etc.) for which a provision of 5% is made. The&#13;
same percentage of 5% is assumed for preparatory civil works and technical assistance. Price&#13;
contingencies have been included at annual rates of 1.8%, 2.6%, 2.5%, 2.5%, 2.4%/O, 2.4% and&#13;
2.4% for foreign costs and at annual rates of 8.0%, 6.7%, 6.2%, 6.2%, 6.2%, 6.0% and 6.0% for&#13;
local costs, for FY96 through FY2002 respectively. Custom duties and taxes on imported&#13;
equipment, and Iqra (Education) surcharge would amount to about US$31 million. The estimated&#13;
costs of the project are set out in Annexes 4.6, 4.7 and 4.8 and summarized in Table 4.1 below.&#13;
Financing Plan and Lendin2 Arrangements&#13;
4.17  The proposed Bank loan of US$350 million would finance about 15.6% of the total&#13;
financing required for the proposed project and about 25% of its foreign exchange component.&#13;
The proposed Bank Loan would include financing of a portion of IDC on the Bank loan (US$40.0&#13;
million) in order to help alleviate WAPDA's debt service burden over the medium-term, and its&#13;
difficulties in raising financing in the commercial market (para 7.5). The remaining (US$1,900&#13;
million) is expected to be covered by the following identified sources: (a) The Asian Development&#13;
Bank (ADB) for an amount of US$300 million; (b) The Government of Japan through the&#13;
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) for an amount of US$350 million; (c) The&#13;
Government of Germany through the Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KFW) for an amount&#13;
equivalent to US$150 million; (d) The European Investment Bank (EIB) for an amount of US$60&#13;
million; (e) The Islamic Development Bank (IDB) for an amount of US$40 million; and (f)&#13;
WAPDA's internal cash generation for an amount of about US$1,000.0 million, representing&#13;
about 44.4% of the total financing required for the proposed project. WAPDA's share for the&#13;
financing of the project is consistent with its overall financing of its total investment program for&#13;
the period of the construction of the project (para 7.10). The proposed project financing plan is&#13;
shown in Table 4.2 below.&#13;

4.18  The identified cofinancing sources are at different stages of commitment.  ADB&#13;
completed negotiations on November 13, 1995 and EIB's negotiations are scheduled for&#13;
December 5, 1995. Submissions to their Boards are scheduled for December 21 and 12, 1995,&#13;
respectively. The Government of Japan/OECF confirmed its intention to participate in the&#13;
financing of the project. As regards the Government of Germany/KfW and the IDB, their intent&#13;
to participate in the project and the level of their participation are expected to be confirmed very&#13;
shortly, while they are completing their internal process for formal approval of their respective&#13;
loans early 1996. Given the advanced stage of their internal processing, these financing sources&#13;
are very likely to materialize. However, should they not materialize, the resulting financing gap&#13;
would be covered by suppliers'credits. As a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan,&#13;
GOP and WAPDA should provide evidence that the ADB and OECF Loan Agreements have&#13;
been executed and delivered and all conditions precedent to their effectiveness have been&#13;
fulfilled (para 9.1).&#13;
4.19   The proposed Bank loan of US$350 million would be made to GOP at the standard&#13;
interest rate for LIBOR-based US Dollars single currency loans, with a repayment period of 20&#13;
years including five years of grace period. The proposed Bank loan would be onlent by GOP to&#13;
WAPDA on the following terms similar to those approved for PSEDP II, i.e., (a) during&#13;
construction period of the project, a variable rate, to be reviewed semi-annually, equal to the sum&#13;
of the prevailing World Bank Lending Rate to GOP plus a spread of 150 basis points; (b) after&#13;
completion of construction, a variable rate, to be reviewed semi-annually, equal to the sum of the&#13;
prevailing World Bank Lending Rate to GOP plus a spread of 350 basis points. The repayment&#13;
period would be up to 23 years including a grace period of up to eight years. WAPDA will bear&#13;
the foreign exchange risk. During negotiations, GOP and WAPDA agreed to execute a&#13;
Subsidiary Loan Agreement satisfactory to the Bank as a condition of effectiveness of the&#13;
proposed Bank loan (para 9.1).&#13;
4.20 The Government of Pakistan is eligible for the single currency loan (SCL) because it&#13;
converted all its outstanding VLR82 loans to VLR89 terms. The proposed loan of US$350&#13;
million, which will be the only FY96 loan to Pakistan on SCL terms, represents 60 percent of the&#13;
Bank's FY96 lending program to Pakistan of US$580 million, including guarantees.&#13;
Furthermore, the Government of Pakistan has selected US dollar single currency loan terms&#13;
within the context of its overall liability management strategy and the LIBOR-based interest rate&#13;
in order to preserve standard country terms for this project. GOP judges that WAPDA has&#13;
sufficient risk-bearing capacity to borrow on the proposed onlending terms.&#13;

5. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Implementation Plans&#13;
5.1   WAPDA would be fully responsible for the implementation of the proposed project.&#13;
While WAPDA's track record in timely implementation of a large power system expansion&#13;
program and hence large scale projects has improved over the last three years, given the priority&#13;
and complexity of the project, WAPDA has decided to extend the services of PHC to assist in the&#13;
implementation of the project until its commissioning. PHC's past association with the Indus&#13;
Basin and the proposed project, its excellent performance during the preparation phase, and in&#13;
order to avoid delay in the project processing (if fresh proposals were to be invited), the Bank has&#13;
agreed to this extension. These services, which would amount to an estimated cost of about&#13;
US$60.0 million, are being funded by WAPDA's own resources (para 4.8).&#13;
5.2   WAPDA has set up a Ghazi-Barotha Project Management Unit (GBPMU) headed by a&#13;
Project Director with the rank of General Manager (Annex 5.1). WAPDA has already appointed&#13;
key staff on full time basis, and is actively taking the required measures to fill all the posts of this&#13;
unit in a timely manner. As stated earlier, the services of an independent POE to review the&#13;
technical and safety aspects of the project and of the ERP will be continued during the&#13;
construction phase. These services are expected to be financed by the proposed Bank loan.&#13;
During negotiations, WAPDA agreed to incorporate, during project implementation, the&#13;
comments of POE and ERP in the design and implementation of the project as appropriate (para&#13;
9.4).&#13;
5.3   To complement the above arrangements, a project implementation management plan&#13;
(MP), which will clearly define the responsibilities of the different agencies involved, with&#13;
WAPDA as the institution's primary responsible for the project has been set up. This MP would,&#13;
in particular, ensure project completion in a timely manner, and reduce the risk of cost overruns.&#13;
In addition to the regular meetings between GBPMU and PHC, the MP provides for the&#13;
establishment of a Project Coordination Committee chaired by Member Water, WAPDA, which&#13;
meets on a monthly basis, and another high level Executive Committee chaired by the Secretary of&#13;
Water and Power, which would meet as required to review progress of project implementation.&#13;
5.4   WAPDA is proceeding with the land acquisition process expected to be completed by&#13;
June 30, 1996, within the framework of the resettlement action plan (para 6.11). Preparatory&#13;
works including access road, permanent colonies for WAPDA staff, power supply equipment,&#13;
infrastructure in the new villages for RAP, and salvaging archeological sites have been initiated.&#13;
Contracts for the construction of the barrage (C-01) and the power channel (C-02) are expected&#13;
to be awarded very shortly. Bidding documents for the power complex, contract C-03, were&#13;
released to prequalified bidders. Bids are expected to be opened early January 1996, and contract&#13;
award is expected late April 1996..&#13;
5.5   Construction of the barrage will start with the temporary diversion of the Indus River to&#13;
be completed in 1996, the cofferdams which will enclose the main barrage structures, the head&#13;
regulator, undersluices and standard bays. The undersluices will be completed in 1997, while a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42-&#13;
start will be made on the right guide bank and the fuse plug, and work on the head regulator&#13;
including the gates, left guide bank and gates for the undersluices will continue for completion in&#13;
1998. The standard bays including gates, the right guide bank and fuse plug will be completed in&#13;
1999/2000, and the commissioning of the barrage structure will commence. The main features of&#13;
the construction program of the power channel are as follows: (a) excavation for the channel&#13;
lining, and the construction of the bridges and cross-drainage structures will all proceed from the&#13;
downstream (Barotha) end; (b) bulk excavation of alluvial material will be carried out by mass&#13;
loaders feeding mobile conveyor belts, allowing the excavated material to be moved directly to the&#13;
spoil banks for spreading and leveling; (c) purpose made plant will be used to trim the excavation&#13;
before lining, to install the underdrainage system and place filter materials, to place the concrete&#13;
lining and apply curing compound to the finished lining; the channel will be lined in four passes&#13;
and this work is scheduled to start mid 1997; (d) the bridges will be built ahead of the excavation&#13;
of the power channel, so that communications across the channel are not interrupted; similarly,&#13;
superpassages will be built early, to protect the excavation from monsoon floods. As regards the&#13;
power complex, the main features of its construction program are as follows: (a) excavations for&#13;
the power house and other structures will be completed in 1996, and the construction of the&#13;
power house, penstocks and headpond/forebay embankments will start; (b) construction of the&#13;
intake and spillway will start in 1997, and first built-in parts for the turbines will be installed; (c)&#13;
all main structural work will be completed in 1999; and (d) in the year 2000, water received via&#13;
the power channel will be allowed to fill up the head ponds, commissioning of turbines, generators&#13;
and all associated equipment will start and continue until 2001.&#13;
5.6   The proposed project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2001, and the detailed&#13;
implementation schedule is given in Annex 5.2. This plan was prepared by WAPDA and PHC&#13;
and is based on full mobilization of the contractor as early as possible during the dry season.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
5.7   Procurement for the proposed project has been divided in various packages taking into&#13;
account the size and complexity of the project, the barrage, power channel, power house and&#13;
transmission system size and sites, and the various sources of financing.  In particular, the&#13;
packaging of the main project components is as follows: two lots for preparatory works, three&#13;
lots for the main civil works (C-01 for the barrage, C-02 for the power channel, and C-03 for the&#13;
power house), 9 lots for the electro-mechanical equipment, one lot for the transmission line, one&#13;
lot for the substations, one contract for engineering and construction supervision (PHC contract),&#13;
and a set of contracts for the remainder of the technical assistance component. The detailed list of&#13;
these lots, the proposed timing for their procurement and the allocation of funding for each&#13;
package are outlined in the project procurement schedule in Annex 5.3, defined in line with the&#13;
overall project implementation schedule. Overall, there will be about 17 packages ranging in&#13;
value from about US$500.0 million for the power complex to US$0.70 million for the elevators.&#13;
Contracts for generators, turbines, transformers, switchgears, control and instrumentation,&#13;
substations and transmission lines would be awarded on supply, delivery, erection supervision and&#13;
commissioning basis. Contracts for gates, cranes, elevators, diesels would be awarded on supply,&#13;
delivery and supervise basis. The remaining contracts would be awarded on supply and delivery&#13;
basis and the contractors of the main civil works contracts would be responsible of their erection&#13;
as well as the erection of gates, cranes, elevators and diesels. In addition, the contractors for each&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-43-&#13;
of the main civil works contracts will be responsible for the overall coordination and&#13;
commissioning of the barrage, the power channel and the power house respectively.  The&#13;
coordination, supervision and commissioning for the overall project is the responsibility of the&#13;
Engineer.&#13;
5.8   Table 5.1 below summarizes the proposed procurement arrangements for the project, and&#13;
the identified source of financing. The procurement arrangements will be consistent with the&#13;
requirements of the financing agency. In particular, the main civil works contracts C-01 would be&#13;
funded by ADB, C-02 by the Bank, C-03 joint-financed by the Japanese Government through&#13;
OECF and the Bank, and the turbines and generators by the Government of Japan/OECF and&#13;
Germany/KfW. Respective procurement requirements will be applied. Bank funds would also be&#13;
used for some electromechanical equipment and specialized instruments and control equipment&#13;
for environment monitoring and laboratory; and part of the technical assistance component.&#13;
Annex 5.3 gives the detailed contract packaging and allocation of funding.&#13;
5.9   Goods, works and services to be financed by the Bank would be procured in accordance&#13;
with the Bank Guidelines dated January 1995.  With the exception of the items listed in the&#13;
following paragraph, all contracts to be funded by the Bank would be awarded through&#13;
international competitive bidding (ICB). For purpose of bids comparison, a preference limited to&#13;
15% of the CIF cost of the imported goods, or the custom duty applicable, whichever is less,&#13;
would be extended to eligible locally manufactured goods. In the procurement of works WAPDA&#13;
may grant a 7.5% margin of preference to domestic contractors in accordance with the provisions&#13;
of the Bank's procurement guidelines.&#13;
5.10  Specialized instruments and control equipment for environment monitoring, in contract&#13;
packages not to exceed US$400,000 and US$200,000, shall be procured through international&#13;
and local shopping respectively, all of which will not exceed US$4.0 million in aggregate.&#13;
Consultants for studies and technical assistance would be selected in accordance with the Bank&#13;
Guidelines and employed under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The Bank will&#13;
review all ICB procurement above US$1,000,000 and hiring of consultant firms above&#13;
US$100,000 and individuals above US$50,000 on a prior review basis. All other relevant&#13;
contracts not financed by the Bank shall be subject to consultation with the Bank prior to award,&#13;
including the consultancy services.&#13;

Disbursements&#13;
5.11  The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against: (a)  70%  and 15%  of total&#13;
expenditures for civil works and installation and erection for the main civil works contracts, C.02&#13;
and C.03 respectively; (b) 100% of foreign expenditures for equipment and materials imported&#13;
directly, 100% of ex-factory cost of expenditures for equipment and material manufactured&#13;
locally and 80% for other items procured locally; (c) 100% of all expenditures for consultant&#13;
services, including studies; and (d) interest and other charges on the Bank loan during&#13;
construction up to an amount of US$40.0 million. Full documentation would be required by the&#13;
Bank to support withdrawal applications for consultant services above US$100,000 for firms and&#13;
US$50,000 for individuals and all other contracts above US$1,000,000.  Disbursement for&#13;
amounts less than US$1,000,000 would be made on the basis of itemized statement of&#13;
expenditure (SOE). The SOE documents would be maintained by WAPDA and made available&#13;
for review by Bank supervision missions&#13;
5.12  To facilitate disbursement, a Special Account (SA) of about US$15.0 million would be&#13;
maintained by WAPDA in a commercial bank in Pakistan. This SA will be used for all eligible&#13;
foreign and local expenditures. Replenishment to the Special Account should be submitted on a&#13;
monthly basis or whenever 20% of SA funds have been used, whichever occurs first. At its&#13;
option, WAPDA may submit withdrawal requests, outside the SA, provided the individual request&#13;
reaches or exceeds 20% of SA balances.&#13;
5.13  Disbursement Profile.  Annex 5.4 gives the estimated disbursement schedule for the&#13;
proposed Bank loan defined on the basis of the project implementation schedule and the advance&#13;
procurement actions which have been taken for the civil works. Because of the nature of the&#13;
project, no comparison has been made with the Bank's standard procurement profile. Based on&#13;
the estimated commissioning date of the fifth unit (June 30, 2001) and in order to allow time for&#13;
payment of the contractors' retention money and unforeseen delays, the loan closing would be&#13;
June 30, 2002.&#13;
5.14  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing.  In order to meet the construction&#13;
timetables, the Bank has agreed to carry out most of the procurement activities for contracts to be&#13;
financed by the proposed loan as advance procurement. Therefore, expenditures amounting to a&#13;
maximum of US$35.0 million (10% of the loan amount) which would be incurred prior to the&#13;
signature of the proposed loan, but after October 1, 1995, to finance advance payments for&#13;
contract C-02 (power channel and auxiliary works) and other additional payments related to&#13;
technical assistance, would be eligible for retroactive financing.&#13;
Monitorin2, Supervision and Reporting&#13;
5.15  Project Monitoring and Reporting. Given the size of the project, its multiple sectoral,&#13;
environment and resettlement aspects and the need for close coordination among several donors,&#13;
understanding has been be reached during negotiations on satisfactory procedures for monitoring,&#13;
evaluating and reporting progress on the project. WAPDA would submit to the Bank and the&#13;
other donors brief monthly reports and comprehensive quarterly progress reports, which would&#13;
include in particular an analysis of progress toward project objectives and key targets, lessons&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46-&#13;
learned and their incorporation in forward planning. These would cover all aspects related to&#13;
GBHP implementation, as well as the other project components. Environmental and resettlement&#13;
issues would be addressed through implementation of the resettlement action plan and the&#13;
environmental mitigation, monitoring and institutional strengthening plans (paras 6.16 and 6.19).&#13;
WAPDA would establish a computerized Project Management System (CPM) to closely monitor&#13;
the implementation of the project. It is expected that the POE and ERP would meet at least twice&#13;
a year to review progress on implementation of the GBHP and the Environment and Resettlement&#13;
Management Plans, and to provide advice on corrective actions as required&#13;
5.16  Project Supervision and Mid-term Review. Supervision of the project will extend over a&#13;
period of seven years, 1996-2002. To make efficient use of resources, the supervision will be&#13;
combined with supervision of other ongoing power projects, preparation for future projects, and&#13;
organized jointly with the other donors whenever possible. Halfway through the implementation&#13;
of the project, in June 1998, a mid-term review will be held to analyze if there are any critical&#13;
problems which require management review.&#13;
5.17  The key issues that would be focused upon during project supervision are: (a) review of&#13;
Pakistan's and in particular WAPDA's power development plan in keeping with changes in the&#13;
economic scenario; (b) a continuing dialogue with GOP and WAPDA on the restructuring and&#13;
efficiency improvement of the power sector, and on required measures to ensure compliance with&#13;
the financial covenants; (c) close monitoring of the implementation of the environment and&#13;
resettlement management plan, including the RAP for GBHP and for the 500 kV transmission&#13;
lines; and (d) technical supervision of the physical implementation of the project. The Bank&#13;
missions would also assist GOP in analyzing policy issues and options in the power sector, and in&#13;
formulating and/or fine-tuning the strategy within the agreed Country Assistance Strategy. The&#13;
total Bank staff-weeks requirement is estimated at about 20-25 staff weeks per year, with three&#13;
missions annually for the first three years and an average of two missions per year for the&#13;
following years. The project supervision plan and the key performance indicators that would be&#13;
used for supervision are given in Annex 5.5 and Annex 5.6 respectively.&#13;
5.18  An Implementation Completion Report (ICR) will be drafted by the Bank within six&#13;
months after closing of the proposed Bank loan, and GOP and WAPDA would assist in the&#13;
preparation of the ICR. GOP and WAPDA would adopt the plan for the operational phase of the&#13;
project in line with the corporatization program of WAPDA, and as indicated in para 3.6. In&#13;
particular WAPDA will define the performance indicators to monitor operations and development&#13;
impact of the project. WAPDA will prepare and make available to the Bank its own evaluation&#13;
reports assessing the project execution including environment and resettlement issues and initial&#13;
operation, its costs and benefits, and the extent to which the objectives of the project were&#13;
achieved.&#13;

6. ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESETTLEMENT ASPECTS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
6.1   The proposed project has been placed in environmental screening category "A" and has&#13;
been subject to the preparation of an environmental assessment and a resettlement action plan&#13;
consistent with the procedures of the World Bank and the requirements of the Government of&#13;
Pakistan Ordinance XXXVII, "Control of Pollution and Preservation of Living Environment&#13;
(December 1983)." As indicated earlier, one special feature of the project is the participation of&#13;
an independent Environmental and Resettlement Review Panel (ERP) during the detailed&#13;
feasibility studies and project engineering design. The Environmental Assessment Executive&#13;
Summary (EAES) prepared by WAPDA and endorsed by GOP, was distributed to the Executive&#13;
Directors in November 1994 (Report No. SecM94-1147), and provides an overview of these&#13;
environmental and resettlement studies. The EAES and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) have&#13;
been translated into Urdu and made available to the people permanently and temporarily affected&#13;
by the project, as well as to Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). In addition, Urdu&#13;
information booklets describing the land acquisition process and the entitlement packages in&#13;
simple and concise terms have been prepared for the affectees.&#13;
6.2   With the assistance of the ERP, environment and resettlement aspects, including the&#13;
protection of cultural heritage sites, were considered in detail in the evaluation of design&#13;
alternatives and in the adoption of a number of design modifications to mitigate potential adverse&#13;
impacts through careful siting of the principal components of the project and in establishing the&#13;
alignment of the power channel (para 4.8). A summary of the environmental and resettlement&#13;
aspects of the proposed project, including details of the alternatives considered is provided in&#13;
Annex 6.1.&#13;
Environmental Impacts and Key Mitization Measures&#13;
6.3   Under the current project design, potential environmental impacts include: (a) changes of&#13;
land use in areas acquired for construction of the barrage, reservoir, power channel and power&#13;
complex; (b) reduction in the flows in a portion of the main channel of the upper Indus River,&#13;
immediately below the Tarbela Dam, when the power complex is in operation: (c) impacts to two&#13;
minor archaeological sites along the power channel alignment, which would be subject to salvage&#13;
excavation, in consultation with the Provincial archeological authorities; (d) relocation of two&#13;
mosques and 14 graves, with the approval of religious leaders and concerned families;&#13;
(e) potential risks for persons and livestock if they enter or fall into the power channel; and (f)&#13;
safety issues associated with transmnission lines.&#13;
6.4   Potential environmental impacts have been examined in the environmental studies and&#13;
action plans, mitigation measures and monitoring programs have been prepared accordingly.&#13;
Annex 6.1 gives more details on the Environmental Mitigation and Monitoring Plan.  In&#13;
particular, the impact of land acquisition will be largely mitigated by the redevelopment of&#13;
excavation spoil for agriculture. The spoil banks and terraces will be leveled, covered with top-&#13;
soil, provided with tubewell irrigation, and resold to interested affectees consistent with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-48-&#13;
entitlement provisions of the project. Measures for fair and prompt compensation as well as a&#13;
number of other measures are also being adopted to ensure that the affectees are provided&#13;
adequate support during the transition period and that the compensation process is transparent.&#13;
During periods of low flow, the river downstream of the barrage will be fed by compensation&#13;
releases at the barrage, to maintain aquatic ecosystems and provide local users access to water&#13;
releases. Detailed studies and evaluations of the potential hydrological and ecological impacts of&#13;
reduced flows in the Indus river have been made, and a compensation release of 28 cumecs was&#13;
found to be more than adequate. Furthermore, and as provided for in the Environmental&#13;
Mitigation and Monitoring Plan, to be implemented by WAPDA as an integral part of the project,&#13;
the water quality in the river downstream will be closely monitored, especially during the low flow&#13;
season, and any adverse environmental impacts promptly mitigated by adjusting the water release&#13;
pattern. A new sewerage system will be provided for Ghazi-Khalo and fisheries resources will be&#13;
enhanced by stocking fish species in the barrage pond. To protect persons from entering or falling&#13;
into the power channel, chain link fencing will be placed in populated areas. Transmission lines&#13;
would be routed to avoid passage over or close to residential, educational, health or commercial&#13;
facilities and relocation for safety reasons would be compensated consistent with project&#13;
entitlement procedures.&#13;
Land Acquisition and Resettlement Process&#13;
6.5   Early consultations with residents of the project area led to identification of land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement as major issues which have been addressed in the project design, and&#13;
much attention has been paid during project preparation to the resettlement and compensation&#13;
aspects.  Based on a complete focused census and sample surveys of the affected persons,&#13;
WAPDA has prepared a RAP. A legal task force appointed by WAPDA was associated to review&#13;
Bank policy and national legislation and to find or propose legal basis for the entitlements&#13;
proposed in the RAP. Field-based reviews were also conducted in the areas of relevant recent&#13;
projects in Pakistan to incorporate the "lessons learned" in the preparation of the RAP.&#13;
6.6   The RAP makes a commitment to improving or restoring the current standards of living&#13;
and earning capacity of the people permanently and temporarily affected by the project. This&#13;
policy commitment has been given operational form through the development of entitlement&#13;
packages (Annex 6.2) clearly identifying the type of land loss or disturbance, definition of an&#13;
entitled person, definition of entitlement/right, additional facilities and services for the affectees,&#13;
including training, work opportunities, credit and provisions for infrastructure.  The RAP has&#13;
been reviewed by the Bank and found acceptable. The RAP has also been formally approved by&#13;
the Governments of North West Frontier Province and Punjab Province, where the project&#13;
facilities are located. At present, the implementation of the RAP is well underway.&#13;
6.7   To avoid or minimize resettlement, civil works were sited either on higher ground or more&#13;
difficult terrain. As a result only the resettlement of 179 families with a surveyed population of&#13;
899 persons, currently living along the power channel and at the power complex sites, and the&#13;
demolition of 110 private housing units will be required. The number of persons adversely&#13;
affected by the loss of land and employment is currently estimated to be 21,460, bringing the total&#13;
number of adversely affected persons to 22,359. Table 6.1 below gives the breakdown of the total&#13;
persons between private title holders, and others affected by the loss of land and employment.&#13;

Total number of affectees requiring resettlement  899&#13;
6.8    Most resettlement would be accomplished close to the original sites of the 110 private&#13;
housing units and their associated buildings to be demolished. Three model villages are being&#13;
established at the following locations: (a) about I km from Ghazi, for those losing 13 houses in&#13;
Haripur; (b) adjacent to Banda Feroze, for those losing 33 houses in Banda Feroze; and (c)&#13;
adjacent to the existing houses of Barotha village on the tailrace alignment for those losing 22&#13;
houses in Barotha. These locations have been identified by the concerned affectees and will&#13;
accommodate 68 of the 110 houses which need to be relocated. Construction of these villages is&#13;
underway. For the remaining 42 houses which are widely scattered, replacement housing would&#13;
be constructed in the vicinity of the existing house. In addition, in each resettlement village, a&#13;
road network, a water supply and sewage system, and electricity would be provided. A primary&#13;
school, a mosque, a basic health unit, and overhead water storage tanks would also be provided&#13;
by WAPDA.&#13;
6.9    Approximately 4,770 hectares of land would be acquired by the project, 3,457 hectares of&#13;
which are privately owned. Uncultivated, the public land is free of any claims by individuals or&#13;
groups with customary rights. All of the privately owned land will be legally acquired. Out of the&#13;
total land to be acquired, 1,640 hectares would be only needed temporarily for spoil banks.&#13;
Through an innovative approach, these lands would be developed, provided with irrigation&#13;
facilities and used as the core of land-for-land option for the adversely affected landowners. It is&#13;
estimated that the potential income of a typical farmer presently working barani (rain-fed) land&#13;
who receives land on irrigated spoil banks should be up to twice that of his present income. This&#13;
would provide the adversely affected people an economic base in the project area by not forcing&#13;
them to resettle in unfamiliar host communities.  Table 6.2 below gives the details of the land&#13;
required for the project.&#13;
6.10   The provisions set forth in the Pakistan Land Acquisition Act of 1894 have been&#13;
complemented through the provisions of the RAP to ensure fair and equitable compensation to&#13;
the affected people. These concerns formed the basis for the formulation in the RAP of the land&#13;
acquisition and compensation process. In particular: (a) instead of revenue officials determining&#13;
the replacement cost of lands and houses, this cost is being decided by a Land Valuation&#13;
Committee composed of the Assistant Commissioner of the subdivision, a WAPDA&#13;
representative, two representatives of the affectees, and a representative from the specially&#13;
created Ghazi-Barotha Development Organization (GBDO) (para.6.18); (b) before commencing&#13;
the land acquisition process each Land Acquisition Collector (LAC) is issuing guidelines for the&#13;
public's information setting forth the considerations governing the land evaluation process; (c) all&#13;
persons losing privately owned agricultural land would be entitled to receive compensation either&#13;
in the form of cash or land; (d) cash compensation is being based on the market value of the land&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-50-&#13;
pIus an additional premium of 15% for the compulsory acquisition of the land; (e) each person&#13;
losing land, dwelling or other property is being issued a Compensation Certificate clearly outlining&#13;
the value of all assets and the precise physical details of the property, and compensation payments&#13;
are being made directly into the accounts of the affectees prior to the transfer of land to WAPDA;&#13;
(f) the amounts deposited into the accounts of the affectees are being cross-checked with the&#13;
Compensation Certificates by the project field teams, including representatives of the GBDO, to&#13;
ensure that compensation payments have been made accurately; (g) the affectees would be&#13;
permitted to farm the land, even after WAPDA has taken possession, until the land is required for&#13;
construction; (h) any scheme for compensating laborers and others who have lost their livelihood&#13;
wvill be put on a sound legal footing; and (i) land acquired for the purposes of the project is being&#13;
transferred promptly to the Federal Government consistent with the requirements of the project.&#13;

6.11   The land acquisition process seems well on its way towards completion by June 30, 1996.&#13;
So far 8 awards, (cost of replacement), have been announced. Another 55 awards still need to be&#13;
made. Out of a total amount of about Rs 2.0 billion required for land acquisition, Rs 380 million&#13;
have been deposited by WAPDA with the LAC, and the balance will be provided as soon as&#13;
needed. The functionaries appear to have gained confidence in the process and WAPDA is&#13;
pursuing its e fforts to ensure that the required land acquisition and compensation process are&#13;
proceeding smoothly. In addition, to complement the provisions of the RAP, GOP and WAPDA&#13;
agreed during negotiations that: (a) land acquisition, compensation and resettlement under the&#13;
proposed project would be carried out in line with the provisions of the RAP and in accordance&#13;
with plans satisfactory to the Bank; (b) a legal framework satisfactory to the Bank would be&#13;
established to apply to persons whose land has been acquired but who have been left in&#13;
possession for the time being, and the standard legal documentation setting forth the terms and&#13;
conditions of such continued possession made available to the Bank; and (c) for the transmission&#13;
lines a land acquisition and resettlement action plan satisfactory to the Bank, to apply to the&#13;
persons affected by the acquisition of land requiredfor the transmission lines, will be furnished&#13;
to the Bankfor its review not later than December 31, 1996 (para 9.3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-51-&#13;
6.12  In order to complement the RAP and to provide additional safeguards for the population being&#13;
affected by the project, WAPDA has had the National Rural Support Programme, a local NGO, prepare&#13;
an Integrated Regional Development Plan (IRDP) for the affected area. The IRDP would ensure that&#13;
the local communities benefit from the construction of GBHP in a long-term and all-round way and not&#13;
only by way of piecemeal compensation. This plan would include social uplift (education, health);&#13;
agricultural development (credit extension services); and business and industrial development. One&#13;
main feature of the IRDP is to involve community participation, during its preparation, implementation&#13;
and beyond. It will include specific programs for women and other vulnerable groups and emphasize&#13;
long-term job development in the region.&#13;
6.13  WAPDA's experience with resettlement issues has not always been effective.   As a&#13;
consequence, a number of outstanding claims resulting from the Tarbela Dam Project, implemented in&#13;
the mid-1970s with the Bank's assistance, still remain unresolved. Based on a preliminary survey being&#13;
undertaken by an independent consultant, along with a legal expert, the major issue relating to these&#13;
outstanding claims appears to be the application of the land-for-land compensation policy. According&#13;
to this preliminary survey, out of a total number of about 4,930 families eligible to receive land-for-land&#13;
compensation, about 1,440 families (29%) are still awaiting the allocation of their land. Although there&#13;
is no direct relation between the resettlement aspects of the proposed project and those related to the&#13;
Tarbela Dam Project located upstream of GBHP, efforts were made during the preparation of the&#13;
proposed project to discuss the best approach to deal with the outstanding resettlement issues of the&#13;
Tarbela Dam Project. As a result, WAPDA has appointed the above mentioned independent consultant&#13;
to define a clear action program based on a survey to deal with the outstanding claims. Annex 6.3 gives&#13;
the terms of reference related to these services. The mechanism to be put in place for addressing&#13;
outstanding grievances should be transparent in terms of legal and financial aspects. During&#13;
negotiations, GOP and WAPDA agreed that as a condition of Loan effectiveness, a survey will be&#13;
carried out to assess the status of outstanding claims of persons affected by the Tarbela Dam Project,&#13;
and an action plan to address legitimate grievances in a timely manner will be agreed with1 the Bank&#13;
(para 9. 1).&#13;
6.14  Participation and Consultation.  Public participation has been an integral part of project&#13;
preparation. Preparation of the environmental and resettlement studies for the proposed project have&#13;
included extensive consultation at the national, provincial, district and local levels.  Village level&#13;
meetings ('scoping sessions') have been conducted with groups of men and women throughout the&#13;
area. These scoping sessions have been designed to inform the affected people about the project as&#13;
early as possible and to listen to their views and concerns. Consultations, including field visits, have&#13;
been conducted with local NGOs including the World Conservation Union (Pakistan), the World Wide&#13;
Fund for Nature (WWF/Pakistan), and the Sungi Foundation.&#13;
6.15  WAPDA has established a main Project Information Center (PIC) at the project site for the&#13;
systematic and broad dissemination of all technical, environmental and resettlement information to the&#13;
affectees in particular, and to the media and NGOs in general, among others on the land acquisition and&#13;
compensation process and entitlement packages. Two smaller subcenters are also being established at&#13;
Attock and Topi to provide easier access for affectees to project information. The information center is&#13;
a critical part of the communications channel for redressing grievances about the land acquisition and&#13;
compensation process. Since it was established in December 1994, it has undertaken an active program&#13;
of outreach activities, including over 146 scoping sessions as of October 31, 1995. It has commissioned&#13;
a popular film/video on the project, including its environmental and resettlement aspects. It has also&#13;
prepared key documents in Urdu, including a schedule of public announcement of awards, Urdu&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-52-&#13;
translation of the EAES, entitlement packages and the full RAP. An advisor has been recruited to the&#13;
PIC to assist in the preparation of written and audio/visual information for the PIC, support outreach&#13;
activities for the affected people and provide training for the information center staff.&#13;
6.16  Implementation    Given the complexity of the proposed project, adequate institutional&#13;
arrangements are being developed to ensure smooth implementation of the environmental mitigation and&#13;
resettlement plans. WAPDA's Environmental Cell (WEC) has been reorganized and is now headed by a&#13;
Gieneral Manager (Annex 6.4).  To ensure close monitoring of the project's environment and&#13;
r esettlement aspects, and adequate coordination with the Environmental Cell responsible for all&#13;
WAPDA operations, WAPDA has set up within the GBPM1U a Project Resettlement Organization&#13;
(PRO) to deal exclusively with environment and resettlement issues of the proposed project (Annex&#13;
6.5).  The PRO includes a Social Sciences Unit which is expected to play an important role in&#13;
developing WAPDA's capacity for supervising and monitoring resettlement. The terms of reference for&#13;
the Social Science Unit are attached in Annex 6.6. A key responsibility of this Unit is to ensure that the&#13;
affectees, particularly women, small landowners, landless tenants and laborers fully understand their&#13;
entitlement and procedures of compensation as provided under the RAP. It is also responsible for&#13;
informing WAPDA of grievances of the affectees, as well as any serious and sustained deviations from&#13;
the provisions of the RAP. Staffing of this unit has been completed and the appointed members are&#13;
already in the field.&#13;
6.17  To support the Environmental Cell and the GBPMU/PRO, mainly during the transition period of&#13;
appointment and training of the relevant staff, external monitoring consultants were appointed in August&#13;
1995, for an estimated 30 staff-months. The monitoring consultants will assist with the monitoring of&#13;
the environmental and socioeconomic aspects of the project as well as the implementation of the RAP.&#13;
Related terms of reference are attached in Annex 6.7.&#13;
6.18  In addition to the PRO, WAPDA is supporting the creation and providing a grant to the Ghazi-&#13;
J3arotha Development Organization (GBDO), originally referred to as the Project NGO (PNGO).&#13;
Terms of reference for this organization are attached in Annex 6.8. The GBDO will undertake contacts&#13;
with the local population, particularly for matters related to land acquisition, compensation, the&#13;
formation of Tubewell Users Associations and the allocation of land on the developed spoil banks. The&#13;
RAP mandates that its representatives participate in Land Valuation Committee meetings which are&#13;
required for the land acquisition and compensation process. It will also be the administrator of the&#13;
IRDP.  WAPDA has selected the National Rural Support Program  (NRSP), an internationally&#13;
recognized independent Pakistani NGO, to set up the GBDO for the project. A memorandum of&#13;
understanding was signed between the two organizations in October 1994. The GBDO was formally&#13;
registered under Section 32 of the Companies Ordinance (XLVII of 1984) in October 1995.&#13;
6.19  To ensure coordination among all the different units involved, an Environment and Resettlement&#13;
Review Committee (ERRC) is being set up under the chairmanship of the Project Director. This&#13;
Committee will meet periodically, and its members will comprise the chief of the PRO, representatives&#13;
from the WEC, the Social Science Unit, the monitoring consultant, and a representative of each of the&#13;
construction contracts, and the GBDO. Annex 6.9 outlines the organization of the relations between all&#13;
the parties involved in the resettlement and environment monitoring. To assist in all these matters, the&#13;
Government of Japan has approved grant funds of about US$1.2 million to assist WAPDA in&#13;
implementing and supervising its environment and resettlement plans for the project.&#13;

7.  WAPDA'S FINANCES&#13;
Introduction&#13;
7.1     WAPDA's financial affairs are governed by the WAPDA Act of 1958 which requires the&#13;
utility to operate along commercial principles, and to generate sufficient revenues from electricity&#13;
sales to cover operating costs and achieve a reasonable return on investment. To ensure that&#13;
adequate funds are available for the implementation of its investment program, WAPDA has&#13;
agreed under ongoing operations with the Bank on an Internal Cash Generation (ICG) covenant,&#13;
which requires WAPDA to generate annually from internal sources at least 40% of its capital&#13;
expenditures, averaged over the previous, current and ensuing year, taking into account changes&#13;
in working capital. WAPDA is also required to consult with the Bank before incurring new debt&#13;
should it be unable to maintain a debt service coverage of at least 1.5 times. WAPDA's tariffs are&#13;
set to ensure that these two financial objectives are met. Except for a couple of years, WAPDA&#13;
has achieved these financial performance targets satisfactorily since FY85, and is one of the few&#13;
electric utilities in the developing world to achieve this high level of ICG to finance its investment&#13;
program.&#13;
Past and Present Financial Performance&#13;
7.2     Financial statements showing WAPDA's performance during the period FY90-95  are&#13;
presented in Annex 7.1 and summarized in Table 7.1 below.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-54-&#13;
7.3   WAPDA's overall financial performance during the period has been satisfactory. Its self-&#13;
financing performance has been sufficient (exceeding 40%) in all the years, except in FY94 due&#13;
mainly to WAPDA's retirement of its Second bond issue of Rs.5.6 billion which it was unable to&#13;
roll-over because of unfavorable market conditions. A substantial tariff increase in November&#13;
1994 (averaging 24%) led to an improvement of WAPDA's financial performance, enabling it to&#13;
meet the financial covenants during FY95. Thus, WAPDA is expected to earn a satisfactory rate&#13;
of return on net fixed assets during FY95 of about 19.0%. Average revenue has steadily&#13;
increased from Rs. 1.06/kWh in FY90 to Rs. 1.75/kWh in FY95. Operating revenues increased&#13;
from Rs. 1.09/kWh in FY90 to Rs. 1.77/kWh in FY95 representing an average annual increase of&#13;
10.8%, while operating costs increased at an average annual rate of 13.3% during the same&#13;
period. The faster increase in operating expenses is due to a lower recovery of fuel costs in FY94&#13;
and FY95 and higher fuel costs resulting from an increase in thermal generation to compensate for&#13;
the low hydro generation during these two years. With average inflation rates running at about 10&#13;
- 12% during the period, WAPDA has been achieving rates of return well above inflation, based&#13;
on assets valued at historical book values, the normal practice of public sector agencies in&#13;
Pakistan. While WAPDA's debt-equity ratio has been satisfactory at about 57:43, WAPDA has&#13;
had to resort to substantial short-term borrowings in recent years, in part due to its high levels of&#13;
receivables, especially from Government agencies and departments, and the difficulty in&#13;
mobilizing long-term financing due to the general tightness in credit markets. WAPDA also faced&#13;
increasing difficulties in its bond issues due to the removal of GOP guarantees. Finally, WAPDA&#13;
continues to pay hydroelectric profits to the Provinces out of the surcharge it collects for the&#13;
purpose, and the balance of the payments is paid by the Federal Government. To safeguard&#13;
WAPDA's future financial viability, an arrangement where the tariffs will be adjusted to fully&#13;
cover hydroelectric profits has been agreed under the proposed project (para 7.9).&#13;
Fuel Adiustment Surchar2e&#13;
7.4   In the current tariff structure, all consumers pay a fuel adjustment surcharge (FAS), except&#13;
those who are charged flat rate tariffs. The current FAS rates vary from Paisas (Ps.) 7/kWh for&#13;
the lower two levels of domestic consumers to Ps. 75/kWh for other domestic and all the other&#13;
consumers. The FAS rates are normally adjusted in line with variations in fuel prices. However,&#13;
during the August 1993, fuel prices increased, but WAPDA was not allowed to adjust its FAS&#13;
rates accordingly, thereby adversely affecting its cash flow position. As a result, WAPDA was&#13;
unable to make its fuel payments at the new rates. To compensate for this shortfall, the&#13;
Government advanced Rs. 3.0 billion to fuel suppliers on WAPDA's account, which is being&#13;
recovered through the tariff increase for FY96. For the future, the Economic Coordination&#13;
Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet has authorized WAPDA to automatically charge the FAS "in&#13;
accordance with the prescribed rules without reference to the Government." Accordingly, the&#13;
GOP agreed during negotiations that WAPDA would be authorized to automatically adjust the&#13;
FAS rate or any other component of its electricity tariff to ensure full recovery of fuel costs&#13;
(para 9.2).&#13;
Domestic Borrowin.&#13;
7.5   WAPDA's local debt comprise mainly of bonds issued in the local financial markets,&#13;
raising Rs. 21.0 billion in six bond issues since FY88. All issues were in the form of bearer&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-55-&#13;
certificates except the fourth and fifth issues which had pre-maturity encashment features. During&#13;
the last two domestic borrowing programs, WAPDA experienced difficulties in mobilizing long-&#13;
term resources for its investments because of: (a) the withdrawal of Federal Government&#13;
guarantees on domestic borrowing of public corporations; (b) limits imposed by the State Bank of&#13;
Pakistan on the level of WAPDA bonds that can be purchased by the banking sector; and (c) lack&#13;
of well-developed discounting arrangements for the WAPDA bonds. Thus, WAPDA's last bond&#13;
issue was only marginally successful. To address the issue of meeting WAPDA's long-term&#13;
financing needs, a Domestic Resource Mobilization (DRM) Study is underway with the assistance&#13;
of consultants to review WAPDA's long-term financing options, assess the prospects of different&#13;
long-term financing instruments, and make policy reform recommendations to the Government to&#13;
enhance the long-term domestic resource mobilization capability of WAPDA. Accordingly, GOP&#13;
anid WAPDA agreed during negotiations to discuss the findings of the DRM Study with the Bank&#13;
by June 30, 1996, and implement the agreed recommendations of the study, as it relates to&#13;
WAPDA, by December 31, 1996 (para 9.3).&#13;
Accounts Receivable&#13;
7.6   Over the years, WAPDA's overall accounts receivable has varied around three months.&#13;
Collection from private consumers has been steady at around two months' of sales, but until&#13;
recently, Government receivables were a persistent problem, exceeding 3.0 months' sales. Since&#13;
November 1994, the Government and WAPDA have taken bold steps in improving the collection&#13;
of Government receivables. The ECC approved a set of budget adjustment measures to ensure&#13;
recovery of these receivables directly through deductions of payments due to WAPDA from&#13;
budgetary releases to the Government departments and agencies. As a result, in June 1995, some&#13;
Rs.3.0 billion was deducted and adjusted against WAPDA's debt service to the Government. This&#13;
has ensured WAPDA to comply with the existing covenant under the ongoing Bank loans, which&#13;
provides that all Federal and Provincial government departments and agencies settle all bills for&#13;
the supply of electricity within three months. In order to ensure that WAPDA 's cash flow is not&#13;
adversely affected by high levels of Government receivables, the existing agreement under&#13;
ongoing projects, whereby GOP has agreed to cause all federal and Provincial governmental&#13;
agencies to settle all bills for the supply of electricity by WAPDA within three months of receipt&#13;
of the bills, will be retained under the proposedproject (para 9.5).&#13;
7.7   There is also concern with WAPDA continuing to carry accounts receivable of over three&#13;
years in its books. As of February 1995, total receivables amounted to Rs. 14.8 billion of which&#13;
Rs. 4.8 billion (32%) have been outstanding for more than three years (see Table 7.2 below):&#13;
Table 7.2: WAPDA'S AGING OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF FEBRUARY 1995&#13;

Rs. Million         5,234           4,778           4,821           14,803&#13;

Accounts Receivable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-56-&#13;
7.8   Under the Rural Electrification Project (Ln. 3148-PAK/Cr. 2078-PAK), WAPDA agreed&#13;
to carry out an aging analysis of its accounts receivable, and reflect on its balance sheet only&#13;
receivables outstanding for less than three years and deemed collectible. Although the aging&#13;
analysis is done by WAPDA regularly, a determination of which accounts are deemed collectible&#13;
has not been made. To address this problem, WAPDA has agreed to increase its provision for&#13;
bad debts to ensure that its balance sheet properly reflect its financial condition with respect to&#13;
accounts receivable.  Furthermore, to ensure that WAPDA adjusts from  its books those&#13;
receivables over three years which are deemed uncollectible, the existing agreement under&#13;
ongoing projects where WAPDA has to carry out, by September 30 of each year, an aging&#13;
analysis of its accounts receivable and thereafter, but not later than December 31 in each year,&#13;
adjust its accounts receivable on its balance sheet of the previous financial year to reflect only&#13;
those receivables that are outstanding for less than three years and deemed collectible, will be&#13;
maintained under the proposed project (para 9.5).&#13;
Hydroelectric Profits&#13;
7.9   Under Article 161 of the Pakistan Constitution, the net profits earned by WAPDA on bulk&#13;
generation of power at hydroelectric stations, computed in accordance with a formula set by the&#13;
National Finance Commission of the Federal Government, are to be paid to the Province in which&#13;
the hydroelectric station is situated. In this regard, WAPDA was instructed by GOP to pay hydro&#13;
profits, estimated at Rs. 6.0 billion, to the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) for the Tarbela&#13;
Hydroelectric Plant. In order for WAPDA to make the payment and, at the same time, maintain&#13;
the 40% ICG level covenanted under the Bank loans, the Government introduced a hydro&#13;
surcharge in its tariff structure, which is levied on all consumers. The surcharge is currently&#13;
equivalent to 10.4% of the base tariff and raised about Rs. 4.3 billion in FY94. The balance&#13;
amounting to Rs. 1.7 billion was paid directly by the Federal Government to the NWFP. In the&#13;
proposed project, WAPDA would be required to pay hydroelectric profits to the Punjab Province&#13;
in accordance with the instructions of the Government. The required payments would be treated&#13;
as an outflow of WAPDA resources, and would be recovered directly from electricity consumers.&#13;
Therefore, in order to safeguard the financial viability of WAPDA, and minimize the financial&#13;
impact of distribution of profits on GBHP, the Government and WAPDA agreed during&#13;
negotiations that consumer tariffs will be adjusted to fully cover the payments of hydroprofits,&#13;
and that WAPDA should only pay hydroelectric profits that it collects for payment of such&#13;
profits (para 9.3).&#13;

The financing plan assumes that the required tariff increases to enable WAPDA to comply with&#13;
the financial covenant under the Bank loan agreements would be made from July 1 of each year.&#13;
The financing plan does not include any proceeds from future privatization of WAPDA's assets&#13;
nor does it include any budgetary allocation from GOP. Overall local loans are expected to&#13;
amount to US$354.0 million during the project period. After taking into account the proposed&#13;
loan and all committed loans, the foreign exchange financing gap for implementing the FY96-02&#13;
program is estimated to be US$412.0 million, equivalent to 6.3% of the investment program,&#13;
which is expected to be covered by export credits, and other loans and credits from bilateral and&#13;
multilateral sources. Based on WAPDA's past experience in mobilizing foreign financing from&#13;
these sources, it should be able to secure these funds on reasonable terms.&#13;
Future Finances&#13;
7.11   The projected balance sheet, income statement and sources and applications of funds&#13;
statement for the period FY96-FY2005 based on the covenants discussed above is shown in&#13;
Annex 7.1, and the assumptions used for preparing these forecasts, are shown in Annex 7.2. As&#13;
stated earlier, WAPDA's financial performance is currently assessed on the basis of a 40% ICG&#13;
covenant and a debt service coverage ratio of 1.5 times. To ensure that WAPDA achieved these&#13;
covenants in FY96, the Government implemented a tariff increase in July 1995, averaging 14.5%&#13;
of the existing tariff (27.7% on an annualized basis). To further ensure that WAPDA's investment&#13;
program including the proposed project continues to be adequately financed, the existing financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-58-&#13;
covenants would be maintained. Therefore, GOP and WAPDA agreed during negotiations to&#13;
repeat the covenant requiring GOP and WAPDA to take all necessary measures including&#13;
adjustment of the structure and levels of tariffs, to enable WAPDA to generate for each year&#13;
from internal sources 40% of its capital expenditures averaged over the previous, ongoing and&#13;
one ensuiing year (para 9.5).   Furthermore, in order to ensure that WAPDA's debt service&#13;
coverage continues to be satisfactory, GOP and WAPDA agreed that the debt limitation covenant&#13;
under ongoing Bank Group operations which provides that WAPDA would consult with the Bank,&#13;
should it seek to incur new  debt that would result in its debt service coverage falling  below  1.5,&#13;
will be repeated under the proposed project (para 9.5).&#13;
7.12   WAPDA's forecast financial performance  from  FY96-FY2005, based  on  these&#13;
assumptions (Base Case), is summarized in Table 7A4 below.&#13;

/c On historcal cost basis.&#13;
7.13 The sales forecast are based on demand projections, WAPDA's generation expansion plan,&#13;
and purchases from private sector power plants beginning in FY97. During the project period,&#13;
sales are expected to reach 65,072 GWh in FY2002 from 36,731 GWh in FY96, an annual&#13;
average increase of about 10% which is consistent with the average growth in electricity sales for&#13;
the past ten years. Based on these assumptions, WAPDA's forecast financial performance during&#13;
the period is expected to be ffilly satisfactory. The average tariff increases, on an annualized&#13;
basis, required from  these financial projections are as follows: 27.7%   in FY96, 13.1%   in FY97,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-59-&#13;
22.4% in FY98. 0.7% in FY99, 7.5% in FY2000, 0.5% in FY2001, 5.7% in FY2002, 9.1% in&#13;
FY2003, 5.7% in FY2004 and FY2005. The steeper tariff increases required in FY97 and FY98,&#13;
though still within levels of the past years, are mainly due to the purchases of power expected&#13;
from the private sector at the average bulk cost of 6.5 US cents per kWh. The higher tariff&#13;
increase projected in FY98 results from the large purchase of power from the private sector&#13;
(10,511 GWh) compared to 3,153 GWh in FY97, and the tariff premium paid to private power&#13;
plants commissioned by December 1997. Beyond FY98, the tariff increases required are within&#13;
reasonable levels averaging between 0.5% to 9.0%. Based on these projected tariff increases,&#13;
WAPDA's internal cash generation is expected to remain in excess of 40% of its average&#13;
investment program. The rate of return on net fixed assets throughout the project period are well&#13;
above inflation. The current ratio and capital structure remain to be fully satisfactory, particularly&#13;
during the later years of the project period, when WAPDA begins to retire long-term debt, and&#13;
borrowing requirements for capital expenditures decline.&#13;
7.14  WAPDA's management is aware of the need to strengthen its finances, and have agreed to&#13;
pursue cost efficiency measures in addition to tariff adjustments (para. 3.19). These measures&#13;
include, inter alia: (a) making improvements in operational efficiency and cost controls; (b) using&#13;
more prudent investment planning, taking into account the company's financial constraints; and&#13;
(c) maximizing loan maturities for future investments. In this regard, international management&#13;
consultants will, among others, assist WAPDA in implementing financial efficiency measures. In&#13;
addition, these consultants would review the ongoing study on WAPDA's financial performance&#13;
criteria, and make appropriate recommendations consistent with WAPDA's corporatization and&#13;
commercialization objectives.&#13;
7.15  Sensitivity tests of adverse scenarios with respect to high system losses, increases in&#13;
investment costs, increases in accounts receivable and commercial rates for all future foreign&#13;
exchange borrowings were made (Annex 7.3). Overall, the sensitivity analysis indicates that&#13;
WAPDA's required tariff increases are in line with the Base Case. Even in the most pessimistic&#13;
scenario, which combines high system losses of 24.2% (the highest level in the last five years),&#13;
increases in investments costs by 25% (which is unlikely as WAPDA adjusts its investment costs&#13;
in response to availability of financing), increases in accounts receivable to 3.6 months sales&#13;
(compared to the normal overall performance of 2.4 months' sales) and commercial foreign&#13;
exchange borrowing rates at 19% compared to past onlending rates between 11%-14%,&#13;
WAPDA's tariff increase requirements would remain reasonable with the exception of one year&#13;
(FY98, 28.8%). The probability of this one-year, worst-case scenario is very low, considering&#13;
that: (i) WAPDA is committed to reducing its line losses through a covenant with the ADB (para.&#13;
3.17) and is now implementing a time-bound, loss-reduction program; (ii) WAPDA's five-year&#13;
rolling investment program is subject to review with the Bank to assess its adequacy and ensure&#13;
its financeability, thereby making program costs increasing by 25% unlikely; (iii) WAPDA's&#13;
collection of Government accounts receivable has now been institutionalized, resulting in&#13;
automatic collection of Government receivables through direct deduction from budgetary&#13;
releases; and (iv) foreign borrowing from bilateral and multi-lateral sources have been onlent to&#13;
WAPDA at a maximum of 14% as the onlending spread (kept by the Government) is already high&#13;
at between 9%-1 1% (only 1 foreign loan out of 35 onlent to WAPDA in the past ten years has&#13;
been at 14%, the rest have have been onlent at 11% or lower).&#13;

8.    PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
8.1   The project is attractive in terms of its fiscal sustainability, its contribution to power&#13;
development, its positive impact on the poor, and its high economic return. The implementation&#13;
of the proposed GBHP would be sustainable from a macroeconomic point of view provided that&#13;
GOP continues its reform program, and from an environment and resettlement point of view, as&#13;
long as the required mitigation measures are implemented. The least-cost analysis shows that&#13;
GBHP is an integral part of the optimal development plan of the Pakistan power system and it is&#13;
required to be implemented at its earliest commissioning date, even under more conservative and&#13;
unfavorable assumptions. The project was selected by the optimal generation expansion model,&#13;
after allowing for significant savings expected from energy conservation and demand-side&#13;
measures (paras 2.15 and 2.16). Furthermore, given its limited adverse environmental impact&#13;
compared to alternatives, GBHP is the best candidate for system expansion under integrated&#13;
resource planning methodology. The project is also expected to have a considerable beneficial&#13;
impact on poor households, as a result of the expansion of the rural electrification and reduction&#13;
of load shedding in rural areas.&#13;
8.2   The Economic Rate of Return (ERR), calculated on the investment program of the&#13;
national power system, consistent with the Base Scenario of the electricity demand forecast (para&#13;
2.10) is estimated at about 27%. When computed on the GBHP alone, the ERR is estimated at&#13;
about 30%.  There are also significant non-quantifiable benefits derived from the project&#13;
consisting of reduced cost of unserved energy, improved operational and managerial efficiency of&#13;
the utilities and further development of WAPDA's capability to address environmental and&#13;
resettlement issues related to hydropower projects. Further, the consolidation of the reform&#13;
program in the power sector as envisaged by the project is expected to have positive overall&#13;
economic benefits, consisting of savings achieved by raising the overall efficiency of operation of&#13;
the system, fiscal relief obtained from the reduction of subsidies and the decrease in public sector&#13;
power expenditures. The increased reliability of the power system will, in turn, save business lost&#13;
output and redundant investments. Such benefits, which are expected to continue materializing&#13;
beyond the implementation period of the project along with the introduction of sectoral reforms,&#13;
would further increase the estimated ERRs.&#13;
8.3   The results of an integrated risk analysis indicate that the probability of an ERR&#13;
(calculated on the power development program including GBHP) falling below the opportunity&#13;
cost of capital is estimated at 8 percent.&#13;
Macroeconomic Impact of Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower Project&#13;
8.4   In order to analyze the impact of the project on the fiscal and balance-of-payments&#13;
position of the country, an assessment of its macroeconomic sustainability has been carried out.&#13;
Such assessment has been developed on the basis of a comparison of key macroeconomic&#13;
projections for the FY1995-2010 period derived from WAPDA's investment program including&#13;
the project, with those resulting from WAPDA's investment program without GBBP, using data&#13;
on investment costs, import requirements, and the financing plan for the project (see paras 3.14,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-61-&#13;
3.15, and Annex 3.5). Both scenarios assume a somewhat slower pace of macroeconomic and&#13;
structural reforms than that proposed in the Government's reform program as described in the&#13;
1993 Policy Framework Paper.&#13;
8.5   The results of the analysis can be summarized as follows: (a) the share of WAPDA's&#13;
investment program, including GBHP, in the Public Sector Development Program would not&#13;
exceed historical levels even at the peak of project investments in FY1998, and would decline&#13;
significantly thereafter, as new thermal power plants are to be built by the private sector; (b) due&#13;
mainly to the policy of no new public sector investments in thermal power plants, the budgetary&#13;
public investment/GDP ratio would decline from 4.5% in FYI 995 to 4% by FY2000; and (c) the&#13;
external current account deficit is expected to worsen somewhat during the project&#13;
implementation period but would improve over time in line with expected improvements in export&#13;
and economic performance.&#13;
8.6   Given its lower cost per unit of electricity generated compared to other alternatives,&#13;
implementation of GBHP will result in lower electricity tariffs, and lower increase in the rate of&#13;
petroleum imports, which, in turn, will have a beneficial impact on the economy and on the&#13;
balance-of-payments. Moreover, given the high economic cost of power shortages (estimated&#13;
between US$0.27 and US$0.75/kWh), the reduction or elimination of load shedding resulting&#13;
from the implementation of the project is expected to remove an important constraint to&#13;
Pakistan's economic growth, and in the industrial sector in particular.&#13;
8.7  It should be noted that since the local currency requirements during the construction&#13;
period of the project and the debt service for the foreign loans are expected to be met from&#13;
WAPDA's cash flow, there should be no direct impact on GOP's finances and no direct crowding&#13;
out of other priority public investment projects, including those in the social sectors. However,&#13;
GBHP financing could affect the funding of other priority public sector projects indirectly. That&#13;
is, if budgetary resources would be required for the financing of GBHP, there could be a&#13;
reduction in the local counterpart funding of other high priority projects. Furthermore, if a&#13;
significant deterioration in the macroeconomic performance of the country were to occur in the&#13;
medium term, the overall balance-of-payments sustainability could be further worsened by the&#13;
implementation of GBHP. A lower export growth, in particular, would lead to debt servicing&#13;
difficulties and a deterioration in creditworthiness over the medium-term.&#13;
8.8   There is, therefore, a need to closely monitor the consistency between the power sector&#13;
investment program and the overall macroeconomic targets, as well as the adequacy of the&#13;
funding of GOP's Core Public Expenditure Program and the Social Action Program, as discussed&#13;
and reviewed with the Bank on annual basis. The agreement reached during negotiations (para&#13;
3.15) would ensure that the financing of GBHP will be independent from budgetary resources, so&#13;
as to protect the funding of high priority public sector projects including in the social sector. As&#13;
regards the macroeconomic performance of the country, the Government's decision to slow the&#13;
pace of the reform program in June 1995 raised a number of uncertainties, and resulted in a sharp&#13;
deterioration in Pakistan's balance-of-payments position during the July-October 1995 period. As&#13;
a first step to reversing the deterioration, the Government announced in late October 1995 a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-62-&#13;
package of measures aimed at strengthening Pakistan's fiscal and external position.'   In&#13;
November 1995, the Government of Pakistan reached, ad referendum, agreement with the IMF&#13;
staff on a stabilization program for the remainder of FY1996 and for FY1997, which provides the&#13;
basis for a stand-by arrangement.  This is expected to allow the resumption of a more&#13;
comprehensive macroeconomic and structural adjustment program at an early date.  Such a&#13;
program  would help improve Pakistan's creditworthiness over the medium  term, thereby&#13;
mitigating macroeconomic uncertainties.&#13;
Least-Cost Analysis&#13;
8.9    The least-cost analysis to assess the level of additional power capacity required by the&#13;
system, and to compare GBHP with alternatives is detailed in Annex 8. 1. The analysis has been&#13;
developed on the basis of the three electricity demand forecast scenarios, described in para 2. 10.&#13;
Under all three scenarios, the proposed project is selected at its earliest completion date. The&#13;
Internal Rate of Return calculated on the difference between the power generation costs of the&#13;
expansion program with and without GBHP is 33%. A sensitivity analysis has been developed to&#13;
test: (a) the robustness of the least-cost solution to variations in the main parameters of the&#13;
analysis, such as a higher discount rate, lower cost of unserved energy, elimination of the&#13;
reliability criterion, higher capital cost for GBHP, lower and higher demand forecast; (b) the&#13;
robustness of GBHP as part of the least-cost solution through changes in the number of private&#13;
thermal power projects which could be implemented before the commissioning date of GBHP;&#13;
and (c) the inclusion in the analysis of a group of medium-size hydropower projects identified by&#13;
GOP with the assistance of GTZ (the German Agency for Technical Cooperation).&#13;
8.10   Sensitivity on the Main Parameters. The results of the sensitivity analysis on the main&#13;
parameters used in the analysis indicate that GBHP is an integral part of the least-cost solution,&#13;
and that it should be implemented as early as possible. In particular, the least-cost expansion&#13;
generation program including GBHP is not affected by the adoption of a higher discount rate&#13;
(15%), the elimination of the reliability criterion, the introduction of a low cost of unserved&#13;
energy (US$0.27/kWh), and higher capital cost for GBHP (+40%), even under the Low demand&#13;
scenario.&#13;
8.11   Sensitivity on New Private Projects. As also indicated in para 2.11, the least-cost analysis&#13;
indicates that under the Base demand scenario, about 5200 MW of private power thermal&#13;
projects would be required to be commissioned by FY2002 along with the ongoing projects and&#13;
GBHP. Under the High and the Low demand scenarios, the required amount of private&#13;
projects by FY2002 is about 7200 MW, and 3100 MW respectively. In order to test the&#13;
robustness of the GBHP, a higher number of private thermal power projects has been imposed on&#13;
the least-cost solution under the Base and Low scenarios. The results are given in Table 8.1&#13;
below.&#13;
1 These included a 7% devaluation of the rupee against the US dollar, a 10% import surcharge, a 5% minimum&#13;
tariff on selected tax-exempted imports, and a 7% increase in domestic prices of petroleum products. The&#13;
State Bank of Pakistan was also given full authority to implement a tight monetary policy, and subsequently&#13;
raised interest rates for concessional credit by 100 basis points to 14%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

8.12   Alternative Hydropower Plants. About fifteen medium-size hydropower projects have&#13;
been recently studied at inventory level by the Sarhad Hydroelectric Development Organization&#13;
(SHYDO) with the assistance of GTZ. A detailed list of these projects, whose size varies from a&#13;
minimum of 80 MW to a maximum of 850 MW, is given in Annex 8.1. Although a&#13;
comprehensive data base (including some hydrological data) has been developed, more&#13;
information is required to consider these projects at par with the already identified hydropower&#13;
projects included in the base case. For example, no data related to land acquisition, resettlement,&#13;
environmental mitigation costs is available. More detail work is needed for the selection of design&#13;
parameters, including an assessment of seismic risks and several other design parameters&#13;
according to site conditions.&#13;

8.13   However, for the purpose of confirming the economic integrity of GBHP, several&#13;
sensitivity analyses were carried out with the SHYDO projects as represented in the available&#13;
reports. These analyses indicate that when this broader range of projects is considered, GBHP is&#13;
still selected at its earliest possible completion date. Thus, the medium size hydropower projects&#13;
identified by SHYDO, even at the preliminary costs and conditions presented in available reports,&#13;
are not competitive with GBHP. Further, the analyses also indicate that many of these projects&#13;
might be marginally more attractive than thermal power projects. While this conclusion might be&#13;
a result of the rather incomplete data available and the extremely preliminary nature of the cost&#13;
estimates, further investigations are merited to establish the economic viability and the&#13;
environmental impact of the SHYDO projects.&#13;
8.14   Under technical assistance provided by the Bank, a report on the "Feasibility of Setting up&#13;
100 Small Hydel Schemes in NWFP" was finalized in July 1987. The hydro schemes are located&#13;
in six districts of NWFP, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Kohistan, Dir, Swat and Chitral.  A total&#13;
potential of about 75 MW was identified through 100 schemes. Sixty-three of these schemes are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-64-&#13;
situated at remote locations, at least 10 miles from the grid. Given their size and incomplete&#13;
information available, such schemes cannot be included in the present analysis. Certainly, their&#13;
size indicates that they cannot compete with GBHP. However, it is suggested that more work be&#13;
carried out to investigate the feasibility of these schemes, particularly in the context of an optimal&#13;
rural electrification plan.&#13;
Environmental Benefits and Costs&#13;
8.15   The proposed project will provide major environmental benefits from a lower increase of&#13;
consumption of petroleum products, in particular High Sulfur Fuel Oil and Diesel Oil. On the&#13;
basis of simulations of the operation of the power system with and without GBHP, the difference&#13;
in petroleum products consumption and associated major pollutants emissions have been&#13;
estimated. Table 8.2 below presents the increase in pollutants emissions taking into account the&#13;
2&#13;
characteristics of the fuels used in power generation&#13;

8.16   There are no significant negative externalities associated with the implementation of the&#13;
project. The environmental and resettlement mitigation measures (see Chapter 6), whose costs&#13;
have been included in the least-cost and economic analyses, are expected to more than&#13;
compensate the loss of welfare to the population in the project area. In particular, through the&#13;
provision of irrigation facilities, the agricultural productivity of the land (development of the spoil&#13;
banks) to be returned to the farmers is expected to be twice that of the total land to be acquired&#13;
for the project, which is mainly rainfed. The low water flows between the barrage and the Indus&#13;
river confluence with the Kabul river (41 km) would not have a significant negative impact on&#13;
vegetation, and on the recreational and economic activities of the population in the area.&#13;
Additional income benefits for the population are expected from the development of fisheries in&#13;
the barrage and headponds, more than offsetting the reduced fish-catches in the river. Public and&#13;
private transportation and economic activities in the area will not be significantly affected, given&#13;
the construction of 47 bridges (1 for railway, 34 for vehicles and 12 for pedestrian) as well as 26&#13;
superpassages along the power channel. The ERR estimates (see paras. 8.21 and 8.25) would&#13;
further improve if the above net positive externalities were included.&#13;
Poverty Imoact&#13;
8.17   The development of the power sector in Pakistan is essential to support the country's&#13;
economic growth, which is the basis for a sustained improvement of the living standard of a&#13;
2   If the gas imports scheme to Pakistan materializes (see para. 1.19), and used extensively for power&#13;
generation, SO2 emissions would be reduced, while NO, emissions could increase.&#13;

rapidly growing population. Expansion of power supply is required to reduce the high cost of&#13;
electricity load shedding, and to continue increasing the access to electricity in rural areas 3, where&#13;
poor households are mostly concentrated 4. The implementation of GBHP will allow to continue&#13;
and accelerate the rural electrification program, thereby generating direct and indirect benefits to&#13;
poor households. In particular, an estimated two million additional electricity consumers, mainly&#13;
rural population, would be supplied by the project at a tariff considerably lower than that of&#13;
alternatives. The experience in similar countries 5 indicates that rural electrification, by facilitating&#13;
growth of new economic activities, and a more rapid growth of agricultural production, stimulates&#13;
economic development, improves the quality of life and the condition of the poorest groups of the&#13;
society. The availability of electricity may also help to accelerate industrial growth by improving&#13;
efficiency and lowering costs in areas that already experiencing economic growth. The project&#13;
will also provide direct relief to the rural population through a reduction or elimination of load&#13;
shedding, which, at present, severely affects rural areas.&#13;
8.18   As a result of the implementation of the project, and in particular of the Integrated&#13;
Regional Development Plan (para 6.12), social improvements, agricultural, industrial, and&#13;
commercial development will be implemented. The plan will include specific programs for&#13;
vulnerable groups and emphasize long-term job development in the region. Finally, the project is&#13;
expected to provide employment to about 10,000 workers.&#13;
Economic Rate of Return - ERR&#13;
8.19   ERR on tlka Power Investment Program. In order to evaluate the economic viability of the&#13;
proposed project, an ERR has been calculated on the basis of the incremental cost and benefit&#13;
streams associated with the overall least-cost investment program for the period FY95-2006 of&#13;
which the proposed project is an integral part (Annex 8.2). Benefits are valued in terms of the&#13;
incremental demand that can be served under this program compared to the lower level of demand&#13;
that could be served if no new supply capacity were added to the power system. Similarly, the&#13;
costs are the difference between power system costs for meeting the demand forecast with this&#13;
program (FY95-2006) and the system costs without any investments in new supply capacity and&#13;
related transmission and distribution facilities (FY95-1999).&#13;
8.20   Total benefits for new residential users is divided into the following two components: (a)&#13;
substitution of existing methods of lighting, i.e., kerosene lanterns, by electric lighting, that is&#13;
resource cost savings; and (b) the consumers' surplus derived from the additional quantity of&#13;
electricity above the substituted level caused by the large drop in the price of energy that comes&#13;
with a switch from non-electrical method of lighting to electric forms. For the other consumer&#13;
categories, i.e., industrial, agricultural, and others, the basis for valuing the benefits after FY2000&#13;
is their avoided cost. This is the cost that those users would incur if they had to meet their&#13;

population has access to electricity. WAPDA's rural electrification program has been constrained by the&#13;
insufficient generation capacity.&#13;

estimated at about 27%. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out to assess the robustness of the&#13;
ERR to more unfavorable discrete changes in the main parameters of the analysis, such as a lower&#13;
demand, higher costs, lower benefits, schedule slippage, and additional number of private power&#13;
plants.&#13;
8.22   Sensitivity Analysis. The results indicate that the ERR is quite robust to any change in the&#13;
main parameters and to any combination thereof In particular, the main outcomes of the analysis&#13;
are the following:&#13;
(a)   in the Base demand scenario, the ERR is in the range of between 19% to 27%; and&#13;
(b)   in the Low demand scenario, the ERR is in the range of 14% to 20%, with the&#13;
exception of 11.3% when an increase of 20% in the capital cost of the program is&#13;
associated with an overall delay in program commissioning of 2 years.&#13;
8.23   ERR on the Project Alone. Because of the interdependence in the power sector, the&#13;
standard methodology adopted by the Bank for power projects, and followed in the above&#13;
analysis, is to evaluate the costs and benefits associated with the investment program as a whole.&#13;
Although the least-cost analysis has demonstrated the robustness of GBHP to the main&#13;
parameters of the analysis, such as increase in capital costs, lower demand, etc., it is desirable to&#13;
more directly assess the impact of certain adverse events on the economic viability of GBHP. The&#13;
reason for this separate analysis is that large hydropower projects tend to be more susceptible to&#13;
delays and cost overruns than smaller thermal projects.&#13;
8.24  The ERR is calculated on the basis of the incremental cost and benefit streams associated&#13;
with the implementation of GBHP. The costs associated with GBHP consist of the estimated&#13;
capital costs and related operating and maintenance costs. Benefits are valued in terms of the&#13;
incremental demand that can be served by GBHP, adopting a methodology almost identical to the&#13;
one used in the previous analysis.&#13;
8.25   The results of this analysis indicate that the estimated ERR is about 30%6. Such result is&#13;
independent of the overall demand scenario, as the least-cost analysis has demonstrated that under&#13;
the low scenario, GBHP is still required at its earliest completion date. A sensitivity analysis has&#13;
been also developed to determine the robustness of the economics of the project to changes in&#13;
cost profile and schedule. The results indicate that the estimated ERR would remain well above&#13;
20% even under a combination of high project cost overruns (+30%) and considerable delay in&#13;
the commissioning of the project (2 years).&#13;
6  The ERR for GBHP alone is higher than the ERR for the program as a whole, since GBHP is more&#13;
economical than the thermal power plants that make up the bulk of the generation investment in the least-cost&#13;
development program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

8.26 Economic Impact of Higher Water Compensation Releases. As indicated in para. 6.4,&#13;
detailed studies and evaluations indicated that, in order to mitigate the potential hydrological and&#13;
ecological impacts of reduced flows in the Indus river, a compensation release of 28 cumecs&#13;
would be more than adequate. Nevertheless, the water quality in the river downstream will be&#13;
closely monitored, especially during the dry low flow season, and any adverse environmental&#13;
impacts quickly identified and mitigated by adjusting the water release pattern. In this context, a&#13;
sensitivity analysis have been carried out to assess the economic impact of a higher compensation&#13;
release of about 420 cumecs, which is equivalent to the existing flow in the river during the dry&#13;
low flow season. This would result in a lower level of energy generated by the project, as the&#13;
water flow in the power channel would decrease to about 5 cumecs. The results of the least-cost&#13;
analysis demonstrates that, even under such unfavorable assumption, GBHP is still selected at its&#13;
earliest completion date. The results of the economic analysis on GBHP alone indicates the ERR&#13;
would decline from about 30% to 27%. Such reduction would be lower for the ERR calculated&#13;
on the investment program, as the decrease in the energy generated by GBHP would be partially&#13;
compensated by other power plants.&#13;
Risks and Mitieation Measures&#13;
8.27  Risks. Bank's experience indicates that there are always substantial risks associated with&#13;
large scale hydroelectric projects. In order to reduce such risks, various measures have been&#13;
considered in the preparation, design, institutional arrangements and processing of the proposed&#13;
project.  In particular, risks which could affect the proposed project could relate to the&#13;
macroeconomic performance of the country, possible excess amount of private power supply, and&#13;
to project implementation. The risk of a deterioration in the economic performance of the country&#13;
and related creditworthiness could result in a lower electricity demand, delay in implementation&#13;
and/or higher cost of both public and private sector power projects. The risk of an excessive&#13;
power supply due to a higher than required level of new private thermal power plants could result&#13;
in a delay in the operational start-up of GBHP.&#13;
8.28  Risks related to project implementation that could result in potential cost overruns, delays&#13;
or a combination of both, could stem from the following: (a) non-mobilization of financing&#13;
requirements, including the local financing component, (b) a unsatisfactory resettlement,&#13;
relocation, and compensation of Project Affected People and delay in implementing steps&#13;
identified to mitigate negative environmental and cultural heritage impacts, (c) construction delay,&#13;
and (d) risks of engineering nature generally associated with hydroelectric projects, such as&#13;
geological and hydrological uncertainties.&#13;
8.29  Risks Mitigation Measures. Various measures have been designed to mitigate the risks&#13;
described above so that the economic viability of the project will be safeguarded. The broader&#13;
macroeconomic risk of deterioration of the short-term financial balance is addressed by GOP's&#13;
commitment to an acceptable fiscal and monetary program supported by appropriate structural&#13;
measures designed to strengthen its revenue mobilization capacity. The risk of inconsistency&#13;
between the macroeconomic framework and the increased level of Public Sector Development&#13;
Program resulting from the implementation of GBHP, has been mitigated by the agreements&#13;
proposed in para. 3.15. The risk related to the amount of private power supply, which could&#13;
result in a possible mismatch between power demand and supply has been mitigated by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-68-&#13;
agreement reached during negotiations that the Government will introduce policies and an&#13;
appropriate solicitation mechanism to ensure timely implementation of the required additional&#13;
capacity. (para 2.13).&#13;
8.30  The specific project implementation risks have been also mitigated so that the probabilities&#13;
of delay in project implementation and cost overruns are considerably reduced. The risk of non-&#13;
mobilization of financing has been mitigated by the high priority given by GOP to the&#13;
development of the project, the level of commitments of all cofinanciers, and by the legal&#13;
agreements requiring WAPDA to generate local funds through improvement in efficiency and&#13;
satisfactory tariffs needed to comply with the financial covenants. WAPDA's consistent record&#13;
over the last seven years in meeting an ambitious cash generation covenant provides additional&#13;
comfort in the project. The risks related to an unsatisfactory resettlement, relocation and&#13;
compensation of affectees and delay in implementing steps identified to mitigate negative&#13;
environmental and cultural heritage impacts are being largely mitigated by the comprehensiveness&#13;
of the Environmental and Resettlement Management Plan and monitoring arrangements through:&#13;
(a) setting a Public Information Center at the project site; (b) obtaining assistance of a Project&#13;
Non-Governmental Organization and an independent consultant for monitoring resettlement and&#13;
relocation of affectees and implementation of environmental mitigation steps; (c) WAPDA's&#13;
commitment to implement an Integrated Regional Development Plan to support locally-based&#13;
economic activities in the area; and (d) continued support from the Independent Environment and&#13;
Resettlement Review Panel. To mitigate risks of engineering nature, WAPDA is being assisted by&#13;
its consultants, and a Panel of Experts will periodically visit the site. Further, geological and&#13;
hydrological uncertainties are reduced to a minimum because of the extensive investigations at the&#13;
sites of the barrage, power channel and power house, and the comprehensive knowledge gained in&#13;
the construction and operation of Tarbela Dam. Possible construction delays are being minimized&#13;
by the advanced stage of procurement of the major works, ensuring effective project management&#13;
and supervision through WAPDA's internal organization for the project and assistance of its&#13;
consultants. To avoid delays caused by claims of contractors, a Dispute Review Board is being&#13;
appointed to settle all claims as expeditiously as possible.&#13;
8.31   Risks Analysis. The risks described above have been analyzed and summarized under&#13;
different scenarios. Probabilities have been assigned to each scenario, so that a weighted average&#13;
ERR and a probability distribution for the ERR can be obtained. The scenarios considered in the&#13;
analysis are the following: demand uncertainties (high, base, and low scenarios), cost profiles (no&#13;
cost overruns, 15 percent costs overruns, 30 percent cost overruns), schedule delay (no delay, I&#13;
year delay, and 2 year delay) and amount of additional capacity provided by private projects&#13;
(3100 MW, 5200 MW, and 7200 MW). The analysis has been carried out separately for the ERR&#13;
on the overall power sector program and for the ERR on GBHP alone. Details of the assumptions&#13;
and results are given in Annex 8.2. A cumulative probability of ERR on the power system&#13;
program is provided in Figure 8.1.&#13;
8.32  The results indicate that the risk-weighted ERR calculated on the overall power&#13;
investment program is 18.5%, which is lower than the ERR of the Base Case, but still&#13;
considerably higher than the opportunity cost of capital estimated at 12%. The probability of the&#13;
ERR falling below the opportunity cost of capital is estimated at 8%. Furthermore, the risk-&#13;
weighted ERR is quite robust to changes in the basic probabilities.&#13;

ERR&#13;
8.33   The above analysis has been repeated for GBHP alone.  In this case, the risk-weighted&#13;
ERR is over 23%, and its probability of falling below the opportunity cost of capital is zero. This&#13;
is because under any unfavorable scenarios considered (including project implementation delay of&#13;
3 years and higher cost overruns), the ERR is always in the range of 18%-30%. In particular, in&#13;
the event of an excess of private projects commissioned by FY2001, the consequence to GBHP&#13;
will be a delay in its commissioning date, which is not, however, considerably affecting its&#13;
economic viability. Figure 8.2 below shows the cumulative probability of ERR on GBHP alone.&#13;

Energy Conservation Activities&#13;
1.        The government's energy strategy for the next five-year plan places&#13;
special emphasis on the introduction of demand management measures aimed at&#13;
restraining the growth of energy demand. As part of these measures, GOP intends&#13;
to improve energy efficiency in the economy, particularly in the industrial&#13;
sector, by strengthening pricing and non-pricing policies, adopting demand&#13;
management policies such as load shedding/management at peak periods, and&#13;
promoting interfuel substitution towards the use of indigenous resources such as&#13;
coal and gas.&#13;
2.        As regards non-pricing measures to improve energy efficiency and&#13;
conservation, GOP intends to support the ongoing activities which are being&#13;
implemented by the National Energy Conservation Center (ENERCON). For the Eighth&#13;
five-year plan, GOP has endorsed the following ENERCON-sponsored investments: (a)&#13;
Power Factor Improvement Program, aimed at saving 1,343 GWh/year or over TOE&#13;
115,000 (equivalent to a net saving of 76 MW/year of installed generation&#13;
capacity) through the installation of bank capacitors at 2,400 industrial plants,&#13;
financed by ADB, (b) Commercial Building Lighting Efficiency Improvement Program,&#13;
aimed at saving about 110 GWh/year (equivalent to TOE 9,500/year) by replacing&#13;
lighting fixtures in the commercial buildings of the main cities; (b) Industrial&#13;
Boiler and Steam Systems Efficiency Improvement Program, which would save 0.23&#13;
million TOE/year of natural gas by replacing and retrofitting low-efficient&#13;
boilers among 500-750 industrial consumers; (c) Municipal Pumpsets Efficiency&#13;
Improvement Program, aimed at saving 60-70 GWh/year (equivalent to TOE 6,000&#13;
thousand/year) by retrofitting 500 large capacity pumpsets used in conjunction&#13;
with water supply and sewerage operation (d) Agricultural Tubewells Efficiency&#13;
Improvement Program, consisting of implementing retrofit measures for 26,000&#13;
pumpsets for tubewell irrigation operation, saving about 180-200 GWh/year&#13;
(equivalent to over TOE 17,000/year), and (e) Road Transport Fuel Efficiency&#13;
Improvement Program, for the tune-up of gasoline and diesel-driven vehicles aimed&#13;
at fuel savings of 11%. In addition, GOP intends to promulgate regulations aimed&#13;
at promoting energy conservation among energy producers/consumers, and to concede&#13;
preferential duties/taxes for energy efficient equipment.&#13;
3.        GOP is initiating action to enact an Energy Conservation and Management&#13;
Bill that would establish a firm legal and organizational framework for the&#13;
National Energy Conservation Program in the country. When enacted (GOP plans to&#13;
submit the bill on the proposed law to the Parliament for ratification in the near&#13;
future), the proposed law would provide the legal basis for the establishment of&#13;
the Pakistan Energy Conservation Council (PECC), which would have the authority to&#13;
enforce regulations on energy conservation. Under the provisions of the proposed&#13;
law, ENERCON would be transformed into an executing agency for the PECC, and&#13;
accordingly charged with responsibilities previously outside its mandate,&#13;
including: (a) developing schemes to mobilize and channel financing for energy&#13;
conservation investments, including the creation of a National Energy Conservation&#13;
Fund; (b) implementing technology transfer schemes in the field of energy&#13;
conservation; and (c) developing or revising equipment performance specifications&#13;
to incorporate minimum energy efficiency standards for procurement by public&#13;
sector organizations. Accordingly, ENERCON with the Technical Assistance of&#13;
ESMAP, is in the process of preparing a Long-Term Strategy and an Action Plan for&#13;
the period 1993-98 which would transform the center into a sustainable&#13;
organization.&#13;

1.  Consultant will begin work in Pakistan on or about December 1, 1996 and work&#13;
will continue for a term of six-nine months, depending on work program and budget.&#13;
2.  Objective of the consultant assignment will be to assist GOP and WAPDA in&#13;
assessing the effectiveness of ongoing DSM program and, based on this assessment,&#13;
outline a program of additional measurea and related instuttuational arrangements to&#13;
ensure effective implementation of an agressive DSM program in line of with GOP's&#13;
stated energy policy objectives.&#13;
3.  In meeting these objectives consultant will carry out the following tasks:&#13;
(a)   Compile and review the background materials in the Bank and other&#13;
sources including USAID concerning ongoing and previous initiatives on&#13;
DSM, including load management, power factor correction, end-use energy&#13;
efficiency, market transformation, and supply-side energy efficiency efforts,&#13;
undertaking by WAPDA, ENERCON, KESC and pertinent NGOs and&#13;
private organizations.&#13;
(b)   Compile and review the numerous WAPDA, ENERCON, MWP, GOP&#13;
documents dealing with the role of and targets for energy efficiency, load&#13;
management and DSM in the energy sector and the power sector,&#13;
specifically, Report of Prime Minister's Task Force on Energy. National&#13;
Power Plan Pakistan. Pakistan Household Energy Strategy Study. and&#13;
others.&#13;
(c)   Identify, recommend, and implement remediation of gaps in the planning&#13;
data bases available on customer, rate class, and tariff populations, load&#13;
shapes by rate class, end-use, and appliance (especially peak demand&#13;
contributions),  end-use  categories  and  characteristics,  selected&#13;
demographics, and salient regional/state-by-state variations.&#13;

(d)   Identify, recommend, and implement remediation of gaps in the&#13;
planning/analytic capabilities of ENERCON, WAPDA, KESC, and MWP&#13;
as regards demand-side planning and management. Develop and coordinate&#13;
some shared load and energy impact estimation, project cost estimation,&#13;
and benefit/cost and financial evaluation capabilities that are shared across&#13;
the government and utility organizations.&#13;
(e)   Identify and help develop key institutional capabilities and inter-&#13;
organization coordination needs for ENERCON, WAPDA, KESC, and&#13;
MWP as regards meeting the GOP's DSM objectives. This effort should in&#13;
particular build upon the nascent coordination role played by the ad hoc&#13;
Y'oint Working Group for Energy Conservation/Management", formed by&#13;
office order of WAPDA dated February 3, 1995. This working group,&#13;
comprised of ENERCON, WADA, and MWP senior staff, could be the&#13;
beginning of an inter-organizational planning and implementation&#13;
supervision body that could ensure the overall GOP goals for energy&#13;
efficiency and load management are met.&#13;
(f)    Using the newly-developed planning data bases, analytic capabilies, and&#13;
inter-organization coordination abilities, re-evaluate and fine-tune the&#13;
several GOP and Bank plans for energy efficiency and load management.&#13;
This re-evaluation should seek to ensure that the most cost-effective and&#13;
highest-impact projects and measures are being pursued and in the right&#13;
order.&#13;
(g)   Again working with the individual organizations and the Joint Working&#13;
Group, develop detailed implementation strategies for the Bank-financed&#13;
Energy Efficiency Project. These implementation strategies should&#13;
takeaccount and capitalize on the institutional capabilities of all the&#13;
government, utility, NGO, financing, manufacturing, and private sector&#13;
groups within Pakistan.&#13;
(h)   Develop a monitoring and tracking scheme that would allow both the GOP&#13;
and the Bank to track the success and progress of the Bank-financed&#13;
project and other parallel projects addressing energy efficiency and load&#13;
management efforts.&#13;

Ghazi-Barotha Hvdropower Project&#13;
Setting Up a Separate Proiect Entity of WAPDA to Operate the GBHP&#13;
Terms of Reference for Consultants&#13;
Background:&#13;
1.   The Government of Pakistan, in conjunction with the Water and Power Development&#13;
Authority, is implementing a program for the corporatization and privatization of the Pakistan&#13;
Power Sector. Towards this objective, a Strategic Plan has been prepared by WAPDA, with&#13;
the assistance of international consultants' financed by USAID, and approved by the Cabinet&#13;
Committee on Privatization on July 18, 1992. This, along with the recommendations of a high&#13;
level Energy Task Force (ETF), culminated in the policy pronouncement in March 1994 titled&#13;
'Policy Framework and Package of Incentives for Private Sector Power Generation in&#13;
Pakistan".&#13;
2.   The Plan envisages the implementation of the program in  two sequential phases:&#13;
corporatization and commercialization of the existing entities, followed by the&#13;
divestiture/privatization of the corporatized entities. The restructured power sector would&#13;
comprise: WAPDA reorganized as a holding company; privately-owned thermal generation&#13;
companies operating under free market competition; publicly-owned, corporatized entities&#13;
responsible for the operation of multipurpose hydropower facilities; an independent, regulated&#13;
transmission and despatch entity responsible for the integrated operation of the system and for&#13;
the wholesale power market; private companies responsible for supplying electricity to the final&#13;
consumers; and an independent National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) to set&#13;
standards and regulate the power sector.&#13;
Obiectives:&#13;
In consonance with the stated policy which calls for WAPDA to own and operate major&#13;
hydropower facilities as separate, corporatized subsidiaries of a WAPDA holding company,&#13;
WAPDA has proposed to build the GBHP as a part of its least-cost development plan for the&#13;
power sector. Therefore, it plans to:&#13;
(i) set up a subsidiary 'Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower Company" (GBHC) to organize&#13;
and operate GBHP as a discrete, autonomous profit center engaged in hydropower&#13;
production; and&#13;
International Resources Group IIRG); Putnam, Hayes &amp; Bartlett Inc.; and Hunton and Williams.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 3.2&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
(ii) design and adopt, for the subsidiary, an appropriate corporate structure in&#13;
accordance with the overall corporatization and privatization goals of the GOP in&#13;
the power sector.&#13;
Scope of the Work:&#13;
4.    The consultants would carry out all the required tasks for the setting up and organizing&#13;
the GBHC, which would include, but not be limited to, the following key components:&#13;
A. Legal and Organizational Component:&#13;
.  Prepare the requisite legal documents, including the Memorandum, Articles of&#13;
Association, and By-Laws, under the relevant corporate laws for the GBHP&#13;
subsidiary.&#13;
*  Determine the legal and regulatory requirements to corporatize GBHP subsidiary,&#13;
and assist WAPDA in the formation and registration of the subsidiary in compliance&#13;
of the relevant laws, rules and regulations, and in obtaining business&#13;
license/clearance for the subsidiary to engage in hydropower production and sales&#13;
activities as an independent power producer.&#13;
*  Recommend the organizational structure, including the structure and composition&#13;
of the Board of Directors and management, prepare a human resources plan, and&#13;
determine qualifications for the senior staff.&#13;
*  Assist WAPDA in clearly defining the rights and obligations of the subsidiary,&#13;
including those relating to land and water, insurance, limits of liability, key&#13;
performance documents, and also its rights and obligations vis-a-vis the parent&#13;
company with respect to the legal, financial, organizational and operational&#13;
requirements of the subsidiary so as to ensure adequate autonomy, responsibility&#13;
and efficiency.&#13;
*  Assist the corporate subsidiary in complying with the requirements under the&#13;
existing and proposed regulatory framework for the power sector, including those&#13;
on the labor, consumer protection, and environment.&#13;
*  Assist the subsidiary in establishing relevant legal agreements, including power&#13;
sales agreement and water release agreement, for securing its long-term financial&#13;
and operational interests so vital to its efficient functioning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 3.2&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
B. Financial. Accountin! and Manazement Component:&#13;
*  Identify the assets and liabilities of the GBHC, and recommend an optimal capital&#13;
structure.&#13;
*  Prepare the balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and other&#13;
financial statements for the subsidiary, and obtain their certification by reputed&#13;
international auditors.&#13;
*  Develop and implement for the subsidiary efficient, and preferably computerized,&#13;
management systems for accounting, finance, budgeting, operations, materials,&#13;
personnel and management information/reporting.&#13;
5.    In view of the fact that the existing units of WAPDA are in the process of being&#13;
corporatized and commercialized, the consultants should ensure consistency of GBHC with the&#13;
structure of the rest of WAPDA's corporatized subsidiaries under a WAPDA holding&#13;
company.&#13;
WAPDA Responsibilities:&#13;
6.    WAPDA, through its WAPDA Private Power Organization (WPPO), will supervise the&#13;
consulting assignment. Its responsibilities will include, but not be limited to, the following:&#13;
-  Arrange access for the consultants to relevant records, people, entities and&#13;
information needed to carry out the assignment.&#13;
*  Conduct timely reviews of any progress made and interim reports submitted by the&#13;
consultants.&#13;
*  Supervise the formation of the subsidiary, and ensure that all the tasks proposed to&#13;
be undertaken by the consultants are completed on time.&#13;

Ghazi Barotha HydroDower Project&#13;
Detailed Project DescriDtion&#13;
A. Proiect Description&#13;
I.        The proposed Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower Project is a major run off the river&#13;
environmentally sustainable power project located at about 7 km. downstream of Tarbela dam.&#13;
The project would utilize about 76 meters of available head between Tarbela tailrace and Indus&#13;
River's confluence with Haro River -- a stretch of 63 km. There would be no consumptive use of&#13;
the water by the project. The optimization and economic studies undertaken for the Feasibility&#13;
Report resulted in a recommended Project for implementation, of five 290 MW units, giving an&#13;
installed capacity of 1,450 MW, a channel capacity of 1600 cumecs, and headpond live storage of&#13;
about 25 M cu m. The project will have the following main components, and its principal data are&#13;
indicated in Attachment 1:&#13;
(a)  Barrage. A barrage about 7 km downstream of Tarbela with a gated head regulator&#13;
to divert water released from Tarbela into the power channel. The barrage would&#13;
also raise the water level at the entrance to the power channel to maximize the power&#13;
generation capability. A pond of approximately 7 km in length and 1.5 km in width&#13;
with about 62 MCM live storage capacity, created between Tarbela dam and the&#13;
barrage would be used to re-regulate the Tarbela peaking outflows on a daily basis.&#13;
The barrage works will include the following main features:&#13;
(i)    a normal pond level at El. 340 m;&#13;
(ii)   20 standard bays, each of 18.3 m width, with a crest at El. 332.2 m;&#13;
(iii)   8 undersluice bays, each of 18.3 m width, with a crest at El. 326.0 m;&#13;
(iv)   a dividing island of about 400 m width, separating the undersluice bays&#13;
from the standard bays;&#13;
(v)   a head regulator of 8 bays, each of 18.3 m width, with a crest at El. 333 m&#13;
for controlling flows into the power channel;&#13;
(vi)   a skimming platform for separating flows between the head regulator and&#13;
the undersluice bays so as to reduce the entry of coarser sediment into the&#13;
power channel;&#13;
(vii)  left and right guide banks for guiding the approach flow and for retaining&#13;
the water in the pond;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-93-&#13;
ANNEX 4.1&#13;
Page 2 of 10&#13;
(viii) a fuse plug in the right guide embankment for augmenting the flood&#13;
discharging capability of the standard and undersluice bays in the event of&#13;
extreme floods;&#13;
(ix)   a separation dyke and a cunette to assist in developing a central river&#13;
channel for flows from the standard bays; and&#13;
(x)   protective embankments for low-lying areas along the pond shoreline.&#13;
The barrage will also provide a road crossing of the Indus river.&#13;
(b)  Power Channel. A 52 km concrete lined power channel to convey up to 1,600&#13;
cumecs of water to the powerhouse and connected to two head ponds of about 25&#13;
million cubic meters with structural arrangements for impoundment of surplus&#13;
waters. The power channel would have a bed width of about 58.4 meters, a water&#13;
depth of about 9 meters, and a bed slope of 1:9,600, with a resulting velocity of 2.33&#13;
mis. The concrete lining would be 135 mm thick, reinforced, and joints with water&#13;
stops would be provided at 9 to 12 m intervals. The underdrainage system is&#13;
designed to maintain groundwater levels below the invert of the channel.  The&#13;
underdrainage system would comprise a filter layer under the concrete lining along&#13;
the bed and sides of the power channel. The power channel works will include the&#13;
following principal structures: cross drainage structures - 26 super-passages, one&#13;
culvert and 18 inlets to the power channel, five escapes and 33 bridges including:&#13;
one railroad bridge, one arterial road bridge, five district road bridges, six village&#13;
road bridges and 20 minor bridges. A significant impact will be created by the&#13;
quantity of excavated material that has to be disposed of, which will cover about&#13;
1,640 ha of land. In order to mitigate this impact, suitable measures (including&#13;
tubewell irrigation) have been proposed to permit the return of this land to the&#13;
affected people for agriculture. Provisions will be made to minimize the areas of land&#13;
taken out of cultivation at any time and to return the disposal areas to cultivation as&#13;
early as possible.&#13;
(c)  Power Station. A power station located at the end of the channel with five units of&#13;
290 MW each. The power station complex works include:&#13;
(i)   a forebay connecting the power channel tail regulator to the power intake,&#13;
and including the spillway intake and the entrances to the two headponds;&#13;
(ii)  headponds, north and south of the forebay, with low-level outlet works and&#13;
embankments constructed largely of material from required excavations;&#13;
(iii) a spillway with a multibarrel siphon intake, stilling basin and baffle chute&#13;
leading to the tailrace;&#13;
&#13;

(vi)  a powerhouse containing five turbine-generator units with an installed capacity&#13;
of 1,450 MW, set deep enough to take full advantage of the range of Indus&#13;
river water levels in generating energy;&#13;
(vii) a tailrace channel to carry the discharge back to the river; and&#13;
(viii) a switchyard to receive the output from the powerhouse and connect it to the&#13;
WAPDA high voltage grid through 500 kV circuits.&#13;
(d)  Transmission Works.  The transmission requirement for evacuation of power from&#13;
Ghazi-Barotha and its interconnection with the power system consists of the&#13;
following:&#13;
(i)  500 kV transmission lines&#13;
a.   Diversion to Barotha of both 500 kV existing transmission lines between&#13;
Tarbela and Gatti (140 km);&#13;
b.   Two 500 kV transmission lines between Barotha and Rewat substation&#13;
(200 km); and&#13;
(ii)  extension of the 500 kV Rewat substation for the connection of the above&#13;
mentioned Barotha-Rewat transmission line;&#13;
B. Proiect Studies. Safety Aspects and Status of Investigation&#13;
2.        Studies. While finalizing the design, the following studies were carried out:&#13;
(a) meteorological, hydrological and seismic observations, their analysis and appropriate&#13;
hydraulic model studies for barrage and power complex;&#13;
(b)  sediment studies, using mathematical models, to determine sediment estimated&#13;
outflow from the Tarbela, impact on Tarbela's live storage and sediment's transport in&#13;
the power channel;&#13;
(c)  techno-economic studies to determine the most optimum capacity of power channel&#13;
in terms of cumecs and merits of single versus double channel;&#13;

3.        Present Status. The Project's feasibility study, field investigations, laboratory testing,&#13;
analysis of various studies, project layout of structures, detailed design criteria and detailed&#13;
designs, technical specifications and bid documents for civil works have been successfully&#13;
completed and the same have been reviewed by the Bank , an independent technical panel&#13;
consisting of eight experts and an independent Enviromnental Resettlement Panel from time to&#13;
time. The Panesl of Experts have concurred with technical soundness, economical viability and&#13;
environmental sustainability of the overall project. A summary of the project's hydrology,&#13;
geology and seismicity is provided in the following paragraphs.&#13;
C. Hydrolofv&#13;
4.        Flood Hydrology. During the summer season (June to September), storm run off&#13;
from an area of about 10,000 sq. km immediately upstream of Tarbela is usually superimposed on&#13;
high snowmelt flows. Nearly all annual maximum floods have occurred in July or August.&#13;
Annual maximum one-day flows over the past 30 years have mostly been in the range of 8,500 to&#13;
11,300 cumecs. The flood of record (1929) at Tarbela is estimated at about 18,700 cumecs. The&#13;
maximum peak outflow in the last 15 years of Tarbela operation, has been 14,100 cumecs during&#13;
July 1989.&#13;
5.        Design Flood. The design flood has been considered as the flow which can pass&#13;
through the barrage's gated bays with no surcharge above normal pond level. It has been&#13;
estimated as 18,700 cumecs equal to the 1929 flood of record (a return period of over 200 years).&#13;
The Tarbela Dam with its two large spillways and five tunnels can release up to 48,700 cumecs&#13;
which is more than twice the flood of record. The peak outflow under emergency conditions with&#13;
Tarbela reservoir full has been estimated at 47,000 cumecs when units 15-17 have been installed&#13;
on Tunnel 4, and 48,700 cumecs when Tunnel 4 is still available as an irrigation outlet. The&#13;
routed outflow of the PMF for Tarbela reservoir, with a peak of 46,200 cumecs has been&#13;
estimated as the survival flood for the project. A fuse plug has been designed to be provided with&#13;
self trigger arrangement when the flood rise reaches a preset level, so that extreme floods up to&#13;
the survival flood can be passed. For the larger emergency drawdown outflow, there would be&#13;
sufficient notice for the fuse plug to be breached in advance. The construction flood adopted is&#13;
14,500 cumecs (return period of 40 years).&#13;
6.        Sedimentation. The sedimentation of the Barrage Pond for the proposed Ghazi-&#13;
Barotha Hydropower Project would primarily depend on the sediment outflows from Tarbela.&#13;
Based on mathematical sedimentation model studies, the maximum sediment concentration during&#13;
the month of May (when the reservoir level of Tarbela is generally low) is estimated at about&#13;
1,500 parts per million. In the other months, the sediment concentration is estimated as less than&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-96-                               ANNEX 4.1&#13;
Page 5 of 10&#13;
about 110 ppm, with particle size distribution (PSD) of about 42% clay, over 57% silt and less&#13;
than one percent sand. The major sediment outflow volumes generally occur during the periods&#13;
of low reservoir levels (April to June) and also during periods of high flows (July and August).&#13;
During an average and wet year, the concentrations are low, below 500 ppm, but these could be&#13;
much higher during a dry year. However the sand content would be negligible. The predicted&#13;
sediment from Tarbela outflows for up to 25 years would be predominantly of silt and clay. After&#13;
that period, the sand concentrations should increase. Specific structural arrangements (including&#13;
the undersluices and the skimming platform) have been made under the project, to desilt the&#13;
barrage pond and avoid the coarse sediment flow into the power channel. Also the power channel&#13;
has been designed as high velocity channel with self-cleaning velocities of 6 ft./sec. It is also&#13;
proposed to have a dredger to keep the area of the pond clear upstream of the head regulator, as&#13;
and when necessary.&#13;
7.        Sediment model studies as recommended by the POE have been undertaken and&#13;
would be continued to confirm the design assumptions used in various components of the project&#13;
and to suggest modifications for improved performance. Earlier, eight hydraulic model studies&#13;
pertaining to barrage, undersluices, head regulator, siphon, spillways, super passage and power&#13;
complex were completed as planned.&#13;
D. Geolo2&#13;
8.        Barrage. The river channel right bank at the barrage site is composed of crystalline&#13;
and metamorphic rocks with non-fossiliferous sedimentary deposits. The left bank on the other&#13;
hand is wholly composed of unconsolidated terrace deposits. The barrage is mainly based on&#13;
alluvium foundation (consisting of sands, gravels, cobbles and boulders). While the thickness of&#13;
alluvium at Tarbela Dam in the riverbed was found to exceed 200m, the same in the barrage area&#13;
is found to be erratic in nature, with some boulders right at the surface and bedrock in some holes&#13;
at depths of 30 to 40m.&#13;
9.        Power Channel. The 52 km long power channel passes through varying geology in&#13;
the area. The first part of the channel from Ghazi to Kamra complex passes through alluvium&#13;
which forms a thick mantle overlying the bedrock. At Kamra the channel passes through the&#13;
northern foot of the hills consisting of agrillites, limestones, and guartzites. Beyond Kamra, the&#13;
channel mainly passes through varying deposits of alluvium (silts, clays, gravels), except at the&#13;
northern end of high grounds at Haji Shah and Rumian where rock outcrops forming the Attock-&#13;
Cherat range are exposed.&#13;
10.       Power Complex Areas. The area investigated for the power complex lies along the&#13;
left bank of the Indus River extending from Dakhner in the north to the Haro River in the south.&#13;
The area is geologically known as the Attock basin, defined by the east-west trending ridges of&#13;
the Attock-Cherat range, 7km to the north and the Kalat- Chitta range 5km to the south. The&#13;
basin is filled with thick alluvial sediments deposited nearly horizontally by the Indus, Kabul and&#13;
Haro rivers which flowed through the area in the past. The principal alluvial units include more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 4.21&#13;
Page 6 of 10&#13;
recent deposits of sand, silts and gravel, overlying relatively older beds of siltstone, sandstone and&#13;
at the deepest exposures sandy gravel with varying degrees of cementation.&#13;
E. Seismicitv&#13;
11.       The seismicity of the area is characterized with preinstrumental data as highly&#13;
modified Mercali (mm) intensities of V to VIII. The instrumental data for the present century&#13;
shows earthquakes of magnitude greater than five on the Richter scale with very few events of&#13;
magnitude greater than six recorded within the 200 mnile radius of the project. A probability of&#13;
exceeding ten percent during the 60 year project life has bean adopted as the basis for design,&#13;
resulting in ground acceleration of 0.17g for the Operational Base Earthquake (OBE). The&#13;
Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) has been estimated to generate a horizontal ground&#13;
acceleration of about 0.5g. The water retaining structures whose failure could lead to the&#13;
flooding of villages and loss of life including: (a) the barrage rim embankments; (b) the power&#13;
channel embankments and culvert; and (c) the head pond and foreby embankments, have been&#13;
designed on the basis of MCE.&#13;
F. Water Availability and Operation of Proposed Power Plant&#13;
12.         The live storage in Tarbela reservoir at the time of commissioning of the proposed&#13;
Ghazi-Barotha Project would be about 9,700 M cubic meters (about 13% of average annual&#13;
flow). The daily releases from Tarbela reservoir are governed by the requirement of irrigation&#13;
systems except when excess water is spilled. The hourly variations in the releases are governed&#13;
by power requirements. These hourly variations have become very pronounced after Tarbela&#13;
started operating as a peak load station on commissioning of four additional units.&#13;
13.         Overall operation of the Project and of the generating plant will be controlled from&#13;
the powerhouse control room, which will be linked to the National Control Centre (NCC) at&#13;
Islamabad and to the control centre at Tarbela. All significant aspects of Project operation will be&#13;
measured and recorded by a comprehensive SCADA system.&#13;
14.         The barrage will have a control room linked to the SCADA system. The barrage&#13;
gates will be controlled to maintain the required pond levels to exclude coarse sediment from the&#13;
power channel, to prevent sediment deposition near the outlets, and to minimize waste of water.&#13;
15.         Flows in the power channel will be controlled by means of the head and tail&#13;
regulators. Constant flow will be maintained in the power channel during each 10-day period.&#13;
The SCADA system will provide the operating staff with full data about discharges and water&#13;
levels in the power channel.&#13;
16.         The operation of Ghazi-Barotha Power Station will be as follows:&#13;
(a)  discharging excess flows through the barrage during the high-flow period (June -&#13;
September) when the average daily discharge exceeds the power channel capacity;&#13;
&#13;

(c)  releasing a constant flow into the power channel, by appropriate operation of the&#13;
head regulator gates, equal to the average daily release from Tarbela less water&#13;
discharged through the barrage, water lost through seepage and water provided to&#13;
the existing Pehur canal upstream of the barrage;&#13;
(d)  maintaining fMll supply level at the downstream  end of the power channel by&#13;
appropriate operation of the tail regulator gates;&#13;
(e)  operating the turbines at higher discharges during peak hours, automatically drawing&#13;
on water stored in the two head ponds with a combined capacity of 25 million&#13;
cumecs; and&#13;
(f)  outside peak hours, reducing turbine output in order to allow the flow in the channel&#13;
to refill the head ponds before the next peak demand period.&#13;
17.       The operation of the barrage gates will also take into account the need for flushing&#13;
sediment from the barrage pond and reducing sediment entry into the power channel.&#13;
18.       The resulting patterns of maximum power, base load energy and total energy&#13;
generation on a period by period basis for average hydrology are shown in Annex    . The&#13;
maximum power available in May and June indicates the contribution of the project to meeting the&#13;
annual system peak demand, which occurs in this period. Sufficient water will not be available for&#13;
an economic low-head generation. Therefore, no specific provision has been made in the layout&#13;
for future installation of a low-head hydropower at the barrage.&#13;
G. Dam Safety Aspects&#13;
19.       In accordance with the Bank guidelines for Safety of Dams and Structures (OMS&#13;
3.80, and the presently revised draft OP/BP 4.37), the project provides the following specific&#13;
measures to ensure safety of the proposed dam/barrage and the associated structures.&#13;
20.       Engineering. Pakistan Hydro Consultants (PHC), with extensive experience in major&#13;
hydro projects for over 30 years, prepared detailed design reports related to the safety of civil&#13;
structures.&#13;
21.       Independent Panel of International Experts. An independent panel of international&#13;
experts was associated with the project from initial stages of the project feasibility to carry out a&#13;
comprehensive review of the detailed feasibility, project layout of structures and the detailed&#13;
designs of the project, and to advise and ensure the safety of the dam/barrage and the appurtenant&#13;
structures, with specific considerations of the geologic hydraulic, soil mechanics, sedimentation,&#13;
seismic and the structural aspects. The Panel was comprised of eight well known experts with&#13;
relevant expertise in dam/barrage, appurtenant structures and powerhouse engineering, concrete&#13;
lining of major channels and the underdrainage systems, and the electrical/mechanical equipment&#13;
for the power station. The Panel contributed some important modifications for safe designs and&#13;
has endorsed the project as technically sound and economically highly attractive. Most of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4.1&#13;
Page 8 of 10&#13;
members of this Panel are proposed to be retained and continued for the technical panel during&#13;
construction of the project. The Bank would participate in the Panel meetings as and when&#13;
appropriate&#13;
22.       Instrumentation. Extensive instrumentation is proposed to be installed at the project&#13;
structures and the concrete lined power channel for safety monitoring. The same would be&#13;
further reviewed by the Panel and the Bank experts for its adequacy when instrumentation designs&#13;
are finalized during construction and additional instrumentation will be incorporated (if considered&#13;
essential). The proposed instrumentation would provide handy tools for studying the behavior of&#13;
the various project structures and the power channel and foundations after construction and for&#13;
timely requisite protective measures to control undesirable developments or emergency&#13;
conditions.&#13;
23.       Safety Inspections During Operation. WAPDA conducts regular inspections of all&#13;
dams and the major hydraulic structures in the country and generally follows the practices of the&#13;
US Bureau of Reclamation in this respect. The safety inspections by WAPDA assisted by&#13;
individual experts (as necessary) would be acceptable to the Bank. All works completed under&#13;
the project including the barrage, undersluices, fuse plug, head regulator, syphons escapes, inlets,&#13;
super passages, concrete lined power channel, the under drainage system, spillways, head ponds,&#13;
intake structures, penstocks, forebay and tailrace, and the electrical and mechanical equipment&#13;
would be maintained by WAPDA in a satisfactory manner.&#13;

Enviromnental and Resettlement Aspects&#13;
I.    INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    Incorporation of Enviromnental and Resettlement Issues into the proposed Project. The&#13;
preparation of the proposed project has included the direct participation of Pakistani and foreign&#13;
environmental specialists and social scientists from the earliest stages of project development and it is&#13;
planned that this approach would continue throughout the implementation phase. Emphasis has been&#13;
placed on early identification of potential environmental and social impacts at all levels of project&#13;
planning. Environmental and social considerations have been included in the process of evaluation&#13;
investment alternatives and selection of project layout alternatives for the siting of the primary and&#13;
secondary structures. The analysis of layout alternatives has allowed for a significant reduction in the&#13;
level of potential resettlement and archaeological impacts. This process has been conducted with&#13;
regard to land acquisition, design of components, public safety and project operations. The direct&#13;
participation of environmental and social science specialists on a routine basis has enabled the&#13;
planning team to identify and avoid, or at least mitigate, the potentially adverse environmental, social&#13;
and archaeological effects which are associated with the project. In addition, World Bank&#13;
environment and resettlement specialists have regularly participated in project preparation missions&#13;
since the UNDP supported feasibility study was initiated in 1989.&#13;
2.    Applicable Review Procedures and Reports. The proposed project has been the subject of&#13;
extensive environmental, resettlement and archaeological studies as mandated by the policies of the&#13;
Government of Pakistan, and the World Bank. An environmental assessment and complementary&#13;
resettlement action plan have been prepared for the proposed project consistent with the requirements&#13;

The Resettlement Action Plan (1994) provides a comprehensive overview of social conditions in the&#13;
project area and provides detailed recommendations to address resettlement and local economic&#13;
development in an equitable manner. The Resettlement Action Plan is available in English and Urdu.&#13;
It is complemented by analysis of potential socioeconomic impacts of the proposed project which are&#13;
included in the Environmental Assessment - Main Report, a detailed land ownership survey and the&#13;
recently prepared "Integrated Regional Development Plan for the Ghazi-Barotha Hydroelectric Power&#13;
Project Area."&#13;
4.    Activities of the Environmental and Resettlement Review Panel. Consistent with the&#13;
provisions of the World Bank Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental Assessment," and&#13;
Operational Directive 4.00, Annex B, "Environmental Policy for Dam and Reservoir Projects," an&#13;
independent Environmental and Resettlement Panel (ERP) was established for the proposed project.&#13;
This panel was composed of Professor Kazuyoshi Kawata, chairman and environmental specialist, Dr.&#13;
Anis Dani, social scientist and Professor Janusz Kindler, water resources management specialist. The&#13;
panel has conducted a series of field visits to the project area and conducted meetings on-site, in&#13;
Islamabad with the Govermnent of Pakistan and in Lahore with WAPDA. It has reviewed draft&#13;
reports on the environment, resettlement and archaeological aspects of the project, provided comments&#13;
on proposed approaches to these aspects of project design and recomrnended supplementary studies be&#13;
undertaken for a set of specific issues. It is planned that the activities of the panel would continue on&#13;
a routine basis during the implementation and evaluation phases of the project.&#13;
5.    Meetings with Government Agencies, Potentially Affected Parties and Non-Governmental&#13;
Organizations (NGOs). A major planning activity, important in making the project environmentally&#13;
and socially acceptable, has been early and frequent interactions with the local people, directly and&#13;
through government agencies. This has kept the planning team attuned to public concerns and&#13;
desires, and facilitated the inclusion of the local population in the planning process. A series of&#13;
meetings were held with the civil administration; with national, provincial and district level public&#13;
representatives, and with the local population at the village level. A list of these meetings is provided&#13;
in Attachment A.&#13;
6.    Separate meetings for men and women were conducted at the village level by social scientists.&#13;
Meetings were held with representatives of Pakistani nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)&#13;
including the World Conservation Union' (IUCN/Pakistan), the World Wide Fund for Nature&#13;
(WWF/Pakistan) and the Sungi Development Foundation, a local NGO. Experts from IUCN/Pakistan&#13;
and WWF/Pakistan visited the project area to review the scope of the proposed activities and&#13;
recommended mitigation actions and to discuss the proposed monitoring plan. Meetings have also&#13;
Formerly the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.&#13;

activity by the Project Information Center (see paragraph 72).&#13;
II.    SETTING OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
7.     The proposed project area is immediately downstream from the Tarbela Dam on the Indus&#13;
River in the Punjab and Northwest Frontier Provinces of Pakistan. The area is crossed by the&#13;
historic Grand Trunk Road which links the project area to Peshawar to the West and Islamabad to the&#13;
East. The project area crosses the Chhachh and Sarwala plains. The Chhachh plain, which lies&#13;
between the Grand Trunk Road and the Indus river to the north, is a region that is rich in history,&#13;
archaeology, and communities that for centuries have drawn their sustenance from the fertile alluvial&#13;
soil. The Sarwala plain lies to the south of the Grand Trunk road and is a dry tract of land which is&#13;
poor, sparsely populated and dependent on barani (rain-fed) cultivation.&#13;
8.     Two other areas will also be affected by the project. The most significant of these is the&#13;
broad Indus flood plain and the river bank villages on both sides of it. These villages use the river&#13;
and its islands for water, fuelwood and grazing. The other area is the Gandghar mountains, which&#13;
close off the Chhachh plain on its eastern side. The population of this upland and mountainous area&#13;
depends on the lowlands for market, employment, and health and educational facilities. Considerable&#13;
two-way traffic passes between this area and the market villages of Ghazi and Khalo.&#13;
9.     From the start of the power channel to the Grand Trunk road, there are many villages,&#13;
graveyards and shrines. After the Grand Trunk road, the Kamra Aeronautical Complex lies across&#13;
the route of the channel. Downstream of Kamra, the land is undulating and there are few villages up&#13;
to the Indus river.&#13;
10.   The Indus river between Tarbela and the mouth of the Kabul river flows in a broad braided&#13;
channel with a number of islands (belas) which are either temporary or permanent. Some permanent&#13;
belas are flooded only very rarely and these support a vegetation of trees, shrubs and grasses. Those&#13;
located near the river banks are grazed by large number of cattle, while some are cultivated.&#13;
11.   The project area supports no permanent natural wetlands or open water bodies, other than&#13;
seasonal pools along the Indus. There is little aquatic vegetation in these pools or in the river. The&#13;
rich animal life that existed in the project area early in this century has been decimated by habitat&#13;
destruction and hunting. What remains is largely limited to the wilder areas of the Kala Chitta Range&#13;
(south of the project area).&#13;
12.    Densities of waterfowl and other water-related birds are not large. The lack of suitable&#13;
habitat and the variability of the water regime make in unlikely that the stretch of the floodplain in the&#13;
braided channel zone is more than a temporary resting place for water birds on their way to the&#13;
coastal wetlands. The most abundant fish in the Indus are the mahseer, chaina, rohu, thaila, and&#13;
mallah, which are caught by fishermen who live on the islands for part of the year. A few families&#13;
near the river fish at the subsistence level, using nets and rods.&#13;
13.   The proposed project will be implemented in parts of two provinces. The barrage and the&#13;
first 12 km of the power channel will be in the Northwest Frontier Province with the rest of the&#13;
project in the Punjab Province. The governing authority in the project area is at the District level&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-132-                             ANNEX 6.1&#13;
Page 4 of 27&#13;
with the District Commissioner serving as the key administrative officer. At the local level, elected&#13;
District and Union Councils play an important role.&#13;
14.   The area is occupied by a mixture of Pathans and Punjabis. Most of the population in the&#13;
project area are conservative Muslims with arranged marriages and veiling of women common.&#13;
Women perform traditional household tasks of child bearing, laundry and cooking, and some income&#13;
producing work such as caring for crops and livestock. There are no permanently settled indigenous&#13;
(tribal) people in the project area in the sense of the Bank's definition; however, there are some&#13;
transient tribal people, the Powindah or Kuchis, who summer in the Afghan highlands and winter&#13;
throughout Pakistan.&#13;
15.   Agriculture is the largest economic activity in the project area, employing about 56% of the&#13;
male workforce. Wheat, the major crop, is planted on 55 % of the cultivated land during the Rabi&#13;
season (November-March) and some is planted during the Kharif season (April-October). Most&#13;
agriculture is barani (rain-fed) with about 25 % of the land under irrigation, predominantly with&#13;
tubewells. Land holdings in the project area tend to be small and fragmented with about 90% of the&#13;
farmers working less than 5 hectares, which is considered the minimal economic holding in Punjab.&#13;
III. ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES&#13;
16.   Preparation of the Environmental Assessment included an extensive analysis of alternatives&#13;
which is summarized in Annex 4.2. In addition to evaluation of the "no action" alternative and other&#13;
options for addressing energy demands, the consultants evaluated in detail, on the basis of field visits&#13;
and consultations, a large number of alternatives for the siting of the barrage, alignment of the power&#13;
channel and siting of the power complex. This process allowed for significant reductions in the&#13;
potentially adverse environmental, resettlement and archaeological impacts through direct&#13;
incorporation of these recommendations into the planning process for the proposed project during the&#13;
lay out phase conducted in the early part of the feasibility study.&#13;
(a)    No Action Alternative. The latest (1993) estimate of future power demand in Pakistan&#13;
envisages an increase of nearly 6,000 MW in the peak demand by the turn of the century&#13;
from the present level of around 9,000 MW. It has been projected that various measures&#13;
being implemented to conserve energy may reduce the additional demand by up to 1,000&#13;
MW. At present, load shedding takes place on a large scale whenever generation from&#13;
Tarbela and Mangla dams is reduced significantly. This occurs during January when the&#13;
releases (which are determined by irrigation requirements) are minimal, and also in May and&#13;
June when both reservoirs are drown down. Reduced load shedding occurs in the intervening&#13;
period. Failure to meet this increase in demand will result in more load shedding which will&#13;
disrupt manufacturing processes and commerce, and have serious consequences for national&#13;
economic development.&#13;
(b)    Alternative Generation Projects. In the economic assessment of the Project, alternative&#13;
generation projects (thermal, nuclear and hydropower) were considered. Under all the&#13;
scenarios studied, hydropower has been shown to be the most attractive option for meeting&#13;
future demand. With Ghazi-Barotha included in the list of candidate plants, it was selected&#13;
immediately. From an environmental and resettlement perspective, Ghazi-Barotha was&#13;
extremely favorable due to the minimal and manageable nature of potential environmental,&#13;
resettlement and archaeological impacts when compared with other potential investments given&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-133-                               ANNEX 6.1&#13;
Page 5 of 27&#13;
its unique design and flexibility in layout options which allowed for minimization of potential&#13;
impacts. The use of small-scale hydropower had been previously reviewed by WAPDA and&#13;
determined to provide 70 MW so that it was viewed as a complementary rather than&#13;
alternative investment option.&#13;
(c)    Barrage Alternatives. Five barrage sites were identified in the reach of the Indus river&#13;
between 7 and 12 km downstream of Tarbela. Of these, two sites, A and C, were selected&#13;
for detailed study. Site C offered the advantage of greater storage capacity, whereas Site A&#13;
was preferable on environmental grounds. An independent study by the World Conservation&#13;
Union (IUCN/Pakistan) confirmed the choice of Site A.&#13;
(d)    Power Channel Alternative. Alternative designs studied for the power channel included an&#13;
unlined channel and twin channels. Both options would have required a substantially wider&#13;
right-of-way, with greater socioeconomic impacts and construction costs. Therefore these&#13;
options were discarded. The most economical alignment for the channel would have passed&#13;
through several long-established villages and was considered environmentally ad socially&#13;
unacceptable. Therefore, the power channel alignment was moved into higher ground in&#13;
order to avoid all villages. The resulting alignment would then have passed through several&#13;
graveyards, some very large. Accordingly, further modifications were made to the alignment&#13;
to avoid these graveyards. As a result, the power channel alignment is largely in cut nearly&#13;
70 m cu m of surplus excavated material. Five alternative routes through the Kamra&#13;
Aeronautical Complex were studied, and an acceptable alignment was selected that passes&#13;
through a relatively less important part of the Complex. A number of options have been&#13;
studied for disposal of the surplus spoil from required excavations. The spoil will be used for&#13;
terracing of wasteland where the surface relief is very rugged and for construction of spoil&#13;
banks. About 1,640 ha of land will be acquired temporarily for spoil disposal. The spoil&#13;
banks will be graded, provided with tubewell irrigation and sold back to the affected farmers&#13;
which would minimize the need for relocation outside the proposed project area.&#13;
(e)    Power Complex Alternatives. Five potential power complex sites were initially studied,&#13;
between Dakhner and the Haro River. Jaba, Dher, and Barotha sites were selected for a&#13;
detailed evaluation. All three sites being comparable from environmental impact&#13;
considerations, Barotha was selected as it offered the most favorable topography. Various&#13;
alternatives were studied for headpond sites and embankment alignments. The selected&#13;
alternative requires more land, all of it barani and pasture land with no habitations, but&#13;
significantly increases peaking capacity and also utilizes more of the surplus material from the&#13;
required excavations. Two tailrace alignments were considered, north and south of Barotha&#13;
village. The latter has been selected because it uses the additional fall in the Indus and results&#13;
in less spoil. Following review of several alternative routes, the route adopted for the 7 km&#13;
access road from Haji Shah to the power complex follows an existing dirt road which would&#13;
be upgraded and widened. Various alternative routes for the 500 kV transmission links were&#13;
studied. The routes selected have minimal environmental, social and archaeological impact.&#13;
During detailed design, the alignment and tower locations will be fixed so as to provide&#13;
specified clearances from villages and houses, to have a minimum impact on trees and&#13;
agriculture, and to avoid archaeological sites.&#13;

IV. POTENTIAL IMPACTS FROM THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
17.   The main anticipated direct impacts from the proposed project are associated with the&#13;
construction and operation of the three major project elements: (a) a barrage and its pond near the&#13;
village of Ghazi; (b) a power channel running between the barrage and the power complex; and (c) a&#13;
power complex at Barotha. Secondary impacts would be associated with construction of transmission&#13;
lines. Indirect impacts will be primarily social, relating to the changes in the local economy as a&#13;
result of the project and the settlement of a limited number of new residents with different social&#13;
traditions, especially near the power complex. A summary of the potential impacts is provided in&#13;
Attachment B.&#13;
A.    Effects of the Barrage and Pond&#13;
18.   Implementation of this element of the proposed project would result in the conversion of a&#13;
currently braided stretch of river bed into a pool with a fluctuating level covering about 1000 ha and&#13;
an additional 140 ha for the barrage. An additional 35-40 ha would be required for the construction&#13;
work area. All burrow material will be obtained locally and all spoil used in the construction&#13;
program. It is anticipated that secondary land use impacts would occur due to commercial&#13;
development on both sides of the barrage road which will cross the river and especially in the Ghazi-&#13;
Khalo area.&#13;
19.   The flow in the Indus river down to the confluence with the Kabul river is controlled by the&#13;
Tarbela darn. The main effect of the barrage will be to partly redirect this flow into the power&#13;
channel for non-consumptive use. During the high-flow season, the river will receive the major&#13;
portion of the release from Tarbela. During periods of low flow, the river downstream of the barrage&#13;
will be fed by compensation releases at the barrage with a minimum compensation flow of 28 cumecs.&#13;
When data from the water quality monitoring program indicates the need for more flow, it will be&#13;
released from the barrage.&#13;
20.    Downstream of the barrage, the Indus water is used to provide an estimated 10% of the&#13;
consumptive water demands of 15 riverside villages, principally for watering livestock, washing and&#13;
as receiving waters for sewage from settlements. Little water is taken for irrigation or drinking due&#13;
to the use of wells and tubewells. Flood reductions would adversely affect about 80 ha of recession&#13;
agriculture in Malla and Noor Malli; however, this could be addressed by the project providing&#13;
tubewells for these areas. In the hotter months dry season pools are used for bathing by a small&#13;
percentage of the population. Adequate compensation water for these purposes will be provided&#13;
downstream of the barrage through releases from the barrage supplemented by the provision of&#13;
tubewells to replace traditional wells in selected areas. The project would support rehabilitation and&#13;
upgrading of wastewater treatment facilities for the Tarbela colony and Ghazi-Khalo. In addition,&#13;
releases of sewage compensation and sewage would be coordinated during the low flow season to&#13;
maximize dilution.&#13;
21.   The effect of the project on flora and fauna of the riverain area will be minimal. The loss in&#13;
riverain ecosystem in the barrage pond is expected to be balanced by the development of aquatic&#13;
ecosystem in this reach and increase in riverain ecosystem downstream of the barrage due to&#13;
reduction in flood peaks. Riverain fisheries may be affected by the reduction in dry season flows&#13;
which would have an effect on part-time seasonal fishermen. With effective management, the barrage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-135-                               ANNEX 6.1&#13;
Page 7 of 27&#13;
pool fisheries should replace this loss and provision would be made to assign fishing rights to those&#13;
who have traditionally engaged in fishing in the area.&#13;
22.    At present, the Indus river is eroding its banks and destroying agricultural lands of the&#13;
villages on the left bank downstream of the barrage site which is a major concern of local residents.&#13;
The barrage will significantly reduce this process by providing greater regulation of the flood flows&#13;
and reducing peak flood events.&#13;
23.    The provision of a new crossing of the Indus river over the top of the barrage, much shorter&#13;
and more convenient than the crossing over the Tarbela dam, will be an important regional benefit, in&#13;
addition to boosting the economy of adjacent villages.&#13;
B.    Effects of Power Channel&#13;
24.    The design process for the proposed project involved the extensive analysis of alternative&#13;
routes for the power channel, with priority being given to minimization of potentially adverse impacts&#13;
to villages, graveyards and shrines, and to archaeological sites by avoiding such features. It is&#13;
anticipated that about 1,000 hectares of land would be permanently taken by the power channel and&#13;
its right-of-way. Current land use in the area to be affected by the power channel is a mixture of&#13;
irrigated and rain-fed agriculture, and grazing. In addition, military facilities and industries are&#13;
located at the Kamra Aeronautical Complex. It is estimated that 93 % of this land is in agriculture,&#13;
including pasture and fallow. The power channel does not pass through any forest reserves or natural&#13;
areas.&#13;
25.    While avoiding direct impacts to settlements and other features, the construction of the power&#13;
channel will result in the generation of about 70 million m3 of excess spoil from excavation cuts&#13;
which will require disposal. An additional 1,640 hectares will be used for the planned disposal and&#13;
redevelopment of excavation spoil for agriculture. The proposed approach for the disposal of spoil&#13;
has been designed to avoid excessive costs in hauling the material over long distances, while&#13;
providing for an environmentally satisfactory permanent solution. Under the proposed plan, the spoil&#13;
would be used for banks providing additional channel freeboard, concrete aggregates, construction of&#13;
spoil banks along the power channel, terracing of wasteland, reclamation of land along the left bank&#13;
of the Indus river, and filling portions of deep gullies and nullahs. The spoil banks and terraces will&#13;
be leveled, covered with top soil, provided with tubewell irrigation and resold to interested affectees&#13;
consistent with the provisions of the Resettlement Plan.&#13;
26.    The major impact of the power channel thus centers on the land required for its construction&#13;
and the disposal of excess spoil. Extensive village surveys have been carried out to ascertain the&#13;
views of potential affectees. These have shown that some of the affected people would prefer to have&#13;
land for land, but would not wish to move elsewhere. Since much of the land is barani (rainfed),&#13;
many people would be prepared to work with less land if it were irrigated by tubewells which would&#13;
allow for higher and more reliable yields from crops. Therefore, of the 2,640 ha to be acquired for&#13;
the power channel and spoil banks, about 1,640 ha will be developed for irrigated agriculture and&#13;
resold to the affectees.&#13;
27.    The power channel will be lined and an underdrainage system will be installed which should&#13;
result in seepage losses having a minimal effect on local groundwater levels. The underdrainage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-136-                             ANNEX 6.1&#13;
Page 8 of 27&#13;
system should reduce waterlogging from the over application of irrigation water by farmers in areas&#13;
along the channel. The impact of the power channel on groundwater would be monitored.&#13;
28.    The construction of the power channel will result in the passage of a large fast flowing&#13;
channel running through an agricultural area. As a safety measure, chain link fencing will separate&#13;
the channel from populated areas. Other safety measures will include cattle grids to prevent livestock&#13;
from wandering on to the service roads, high curbs on the channel side of the service roads to prevent&#13;
traffic being driven close to the channel's edge, handrails at points of public access, and frequent&#13;
floating booms and grab rails to assist in climbing out of the power channel. A large scale public&#13;
education program would also be undertaken to alert residents of potential risks, actions which should&#13;
be taken to avoid these risks, and recommended procedures to be used in emergency situations.&#13;
29.   In order to minimize the disruption of pedestrian, livestock and vehicular traffic, the proposed&#13;
project would provide for the construction of 46 crossings of the channel which would be somewhat&#13;
closer together in the more populous upstream region. Most of these are located at the traditional&#13;
crossing points.&#13;
C.    Effects of Power Complex&#13;
30.   Construction of the power complex near the village of Barotha will include: (a) headponds&#13;
and their embankrnents requiring about 636 ha of poor, rain-fed agricultural land and woodland and&#13;
(b) power complex structures, switchyard and tailrace which will take a further 214 ha of land. The&#13;
effects of this change in land use will be mitigated by the development of tubewell-irrigated&#13;
agriculture on the more fertile river terraces.&#13;
31.   A road bridge across the tailrace channel will ensure that the present access between Barotha&#13;
village and its lands to the south of the Barotha nullah will be maintained. New roads will be&#13;
constructed in this area to link the villages with the secondary road system. In the general area of the&#13;
power complex, 50 hectares of barani and grazing land would be acquired near the Attock-Dakhner&#13;
road for construction of the power complex colony. An additional 50 hectares of similar quality land&#13;
would be required for construction of a new access road from the Attock-Haji Shah road.&#13;
32.    The construction of the power complex would result in the obstruction of flows in Barotha&#13;
nullah, require restructuring of the local irrigation system and creation of two headponds which would&#13;
provide habitat for wildlife and opportunities for fishery development. The irrigated land near&#13;
Barotha village, which takes its water from the small perennial flows in Barotha nullah, will have its&#13;
supplies safeguarded.&#13;
D.    Potential Health Effects&#13;
33.    Possible causes of changes in the health of the local population are the creation of the barrage&#13;
pond, the headponds at the power complex, the reduction in low-season flows in the Indus down to&#13;
the confluence with the Kabul river, and the high-velocity flows in the power channel. Malaria&#13;
mosquitoes presently breed in pools along the Indus river bed, and in waterlogged depressions in the&#13;
Chhachh plain. The project will reduce the former and perhaps the latter. The barrage ponds and the&#13;
headponds will be poorly suited to mosquito breeding but if this becomes a nuisance, the larvae could&#13;
be dislodged by rapidly varying the water level by 0.3 to 1 m. Oriental sore could become a problem&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

among the construction workers but can be readily controlled by destroying rodent burrows, using&#13;
residual insecticides inside dwellings and other measures.&#13;
E.    Archaeological and Historical Sites&#13;
34.   Consistent with the Antiquities Law of Pakistan and the policies of the World Bank, a survey&#13;
of archaeological, historical and religious sites was conducted by the Department of Archaeology and&#13;
Museums of the Government of Pakistan. This included a review of known sites in the project area,&#13;
which was complemented by a field survey of the barrage and associated pool, the proposed&#13;
alignment of the power channel (500 meters on both sides of the alignment), the power complex and&#13;
proposed excavation areas for construction materials. The survey identified five archaeological sites&#13;
along the proposed channel corridor. Two of these sites, Musa I and Musa III (both Buddhist period&#13;
stupa and settlement sites) are located in the alignment of the proposed power channel and are&#13;
recommended for archaeological salvage excavations. Musa II (Buddhist period stupa), Pindanwala&#13;
Tibba (Buddhist period stupa and settlement site) and an unnamed mound between Rumian and&#13;
Dakhner (Paleolithic site) are at risk of being indirectly affected due to construction activities in their&#13;
area and precautions would be taken to avoid their burial by the disposal of excavated soil so that they&#13;
remain available for future investigations. Additional surveys will be conducted as part of the final&#13;
planning process for access roads and transmission lines.&#13;
F.    Religious Shrines and Relocation of Graves&#13;
35.   Project implementation will require relocation of a small mosque and 14 graves in a family&#13;
cemetery near Banda Feroze. A second mosque would need to be relocated at Kamra. The mosques&#13;
and graves would be moved to an adjacent location by WAPDA after obtaining a religious&#13;
pronouncement as required under Pakistani law. WAPDA will also notify village leaders to avoid&#13;
further burials in areas which would be potentially affected by the proposed project. In addition, a&#13;
minor religious shrine on the right bank of the barrage pond, 1 km upstream of Galla, would be&#13;
protected by an embankment.&#13;
V.    RESETTLEMENT AND SOCIAL ISSUES&#13;
36.   Construction Phase Employment. Implementation of the proposed project would result in&#13;
large scale employment of professional, skilled and unskilled workers. Construction of the barrage&#13;
would take approximately 51 months and require 2,500 workers with another 300 staff from WAPDA&#13;
and consultants on the site. The professionals would be housed mostly in the barrage colony. Skilled&#13;
and unskilled workers would either be provided with temporary quarters or live at home.&#13;
Construction of the power channel is anticipated to take approximately 51 months and require a&#13;
workforce of 2,600 workers with another 200 staff from WAPDA and consultants at the site. The&#13;
permanent colony, located at an existing WAPDA colony near Lawrencepur, will be available for&#13;
housing professional staff; other workers would be provided temporary housing or live at home. The&#13;
construction phase at the power complex would last approximately 64 months and require a workforce&#13;
of 2,700 with another 300 WAPDA and consultant personnel at the site. A new permanent colony&#13;
would be developed at the eastern side of the Gariala-Dakhner road and would house professionals&#13;
and skilled laborers. Unskilled laborers would be either provided with temporary quarters or live at&#13;
home. For all three construction activities, WAPDA would give preference to local affectees in&#13;
recruiting the construction workforce.&#13;
&#13;

Page 10 of 27&#13;
37.   Operational Phase Employment. The operating staff of the barrage would number 210&#13;
persons, most of whom would be housed in existing WAPDA facilities at Tarbela. The power&#13;
channel would require an operating staff of about 390 persons, most of whom would be housed in the&#13;
permanent colony. The power complex would require an operating workforce of 800 persons, most&#13;
of whom would be housed in the new permanent colony. WAPDA would give preference in all three&#13;
locations to local affectees in recruiting the operational workforce.&#13;
38.   Land Acquisition in the Project Area. Under the proposed project, land would be acquired&#13;
for the following purposes: (a) permanent use for the barrage and pond which is nearly all owned by&#13;
either the Government in the form of river bed or currently owned by the Government of Pakistan&#13;
(1,180 ha); (b) permanent use for the power channel (1,000 ha); (c) use for spoil disposal followed by&#13;
redevelopment for agricultural use (1,640 ha); (d) construction of the power complex and related&#13;
facilities (900 ha); (e) for project related rights-of-way for service roads (approximately 50 ha); and&#13;
additional land would be required for transmission line right-of-ways. In addition, a portion of the&#13;
power channel would cross through the Karma Aeronautical Complex which is controlled by the&#13;
Pakistani military.&#13;
39.   The removal of these lands from their present, predominantly agricultural and grazing use will&#13;
have both short-term and long-term impacts. The primary impact would be a permanent loss of&#13;
agricultural production from the 1,000 ha for the power channel, 950 ha for the power complex and&#13;
its associated colony, and approximately 200 ha for the barrage, roads and other facilities. Critical to&#13;
mitigation of these impacts would be the successful reclamation of the 1,640 ha of land to be&#13;
redeveloped for irrigated agriculture following its use for spoil disposal. Development of fisheries at&#13;
the barrage pond and power complex headponds will only provide for minimal employment&#13;
opportunities. The secondary effects of the removal of income-producing land will be felt by the&#13;
artisans and shopkeepers in the support sector and the landless farmers and laborers who will require&#13;
special assistance under the propose project.&#13;
40.   Resettlement. Implementation of the proposed project would require the resettlement of 179&#13;
families with a surveyed population of 899 persons currently living at the power channel and power&#13;
complex sites and the demolition of 110 private housing units and their associated buildings. As the&#13;
power channel was routed to avoid villages, concentrated impacts would occur only at the village of&#13;
Banda Feroze where strip development has spread settlement across the channel corridor and near&#13;
Kamra where a small cluster of houses and a small mosque will need to be relocated. The remaining&#13;
dwellings are scattered along the right-of-way.&#13;
41.    Most resettlement will be accomplished close to the original sites of the houses. Three model&#13;
villages for resettling affected families will be developed near the power channel alignment as part of&#13;
the project. Compensation for immovable property will be based on replacement cost, and moving&#13;
expenses will also be paid. In addition, the proposed project would fully fund the relocation and/or&#13;
replacement of elements of local infrastructure including water towers, roads, agricultural buildings,&#13;
tubewells, etc.&#13;
42.   Barrage and Pond - Reduced Channel and Seasonal Pool Access. Construction of the&#13;
barrage and pond may have some secondary social effects during the low flow season including: more&#13;
difficult access to the riverfront or to large pools which could affect social gathering of women and&#13;
the more restricted access to water could change social dependency relationships between village poor&#13;
and those households with their own water supplies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-139-                               ANNEX 6.1&#13;
Page 11 of 27&#13;
43.   Power Channel - Redevelopment of Spoil Banks for Agriculture. A major feature of the&#13;
proposed project is the redevelopment of 1,640 ha of spoil banks for agricultural purposes. This&#13;
activity would minimize the need to relocate families whose land would either be used for&#13;
construction of the power channel or for use as a spoil disposal site by providing redeveloped land&#13;
with tubewells in the same area. As the land would be more productive due to the provision of water&#13;
for irrigation, it could support a comparable number of families on a smaller amount of land. In&#13;
order to achieve this objective, great care will need to be taken in the implementation of the&#13;
redevelopment program and monitoring of the performance of these areas. The project would provide&#13;
support for applied research and demonstration activities concerning the use of these areas, as well as&#13;
supporting proper agricultural extension services.&#13;
44.   Power Complex - Possible Social Issues at Barotha. Construction of the power complex at&#13;
Barotha should have a potentially beneficial social impact over the long term; however, it will be&#13;
heavily affected by the project through the construction of major facilities in the village and indirectly&#13;
by the development of the nearby WAPDA colony. During the construction phase, WAPDA would&#13;
need to assure that adequate attention is given to controlling the collection and disposal of sewage&#13;
from workers to avoid any problems with disease. In addition, action will need to be taken by&#13;
WAPDA to closely supervise the contractor to avoid potential damage to non-project areas&#13;
surrounding the village by controlling the location and quality of roads, closely regulating the disposal&#13;
of solid and liquid wastes from the construction operation, stopping the unnecessary felling of trees,&#13;
etc. Measures should also be taken to control potential problems of friction and strife between&#13;
outside workers and villagers hired for the proposed project and villagers who retain their traditional&#13;
way of life. It will be necessary for WAPDA social scientists to carefully monitor developments in&#13;
Barotha to avoid the development of such problems.&#13;
45.    Unplanned Economic Development. The river crossing provided by the barrage would&#13;
result in regional road traffic and create increased business opportunities in the road junctions at&#13;
Ghazi-Khalo and Topi. These opportunities will result in additional population growth to that which&#13;
would be generated by the proposed project. Similar development can also be expected to occur&#13;
along the Attock-Dakhner Road and in the vicinity of the new power complex colony. This growth&#13;
will create additional demands on administrative and social services in these areas. It will also result&#13;
in land use problems unless adequate and timely technical and planning assistance is provided for&#13;
these areas.&#13;
46.   Management of the "Boom and Bust" Cycle. Measures should be taken by the Government&#13;
of Pakistan, in cooperation with the concerned Provincial Governments and WAPDA, to try to&#13;
minimize the "boom and bust" cycle in the project area which would result from the undertaking and&#13;
then completion of a major construction project. Interventions could be usefully made with regard to&#13;
supporting the development of alternative sources of employment in the area which would come "on&#13;
stream" following completion of the project. These could be especially useful in the effective&#13;
channeling of extra income that may have been generated in the areas into productive investments&#13;
which are employment-generating. Measures could also be taken in the planning process to reduce&#13;
adverse effects from unplanned development in the project area.&#13;

VI. ENVIRONMENT AND RESETTLEMENT MANAGEMENT PLAN&#13;
A.    Implementation Responsibility&#13;
47.   Role of WAPDA. WAPDA will have overall responsibility for implementation of the&#13;
Environment and Resettlement Management Plan for the proposed Project. To ensure coordination&#13;
among the different units involved in the proposed Project, an Environment and Resettlement Review&#13;
Committee (EREC) will be established under the chairmanship of the Project Director. The EREC&#13;
will meet periodically and its members will include the Chief of the Project Resettlement&#13;
organization, the Social Science Unit, the Monitoring Consultant, a representative of each of the&#13;
construction contractors and the Ghazi-Barotha Development Organization. Representatives of the&#13;
Punjab and NWFP Departments of Archaeology will also be invited to attend these meetings.&#13;
48.   Role of the WAPDA Environment Cell. Routine oversight for implementation of the&#13;
Environment and Resettlement Plan will be the responsibility of the Environmental Cell of the Water&#13;
Wing of WAPDA. This unit has been strengthened through recruitment and training. The technical&#13;
divisions of WAPDA and other Government Departments, will support the work of the Environment&#13;
Cell, by collecting data pertaining to such aspects as land resources, river morphology, groundwater&#13;
and riverain ecosystems. The Environment Cell will be responsible for coordination of Project&#13;
activities with the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (PEPA); Punjab Environmental&#13;
Protection Agency; Punjab Department of Archaeology; NWFP Environmental Protection Agency;&#13;
and the NWFP Department of Archaeology.&#13;
49.   Role of the Project Resettlement Organization. The proposed Project will include the use&#13;
of a Project Resettlement Organization (PRO) which will report to the Project Director and facilitate&#13;
routine on-site implementation of the Environment and Resettlement Management Plan. The PRO&#13;
will include a Social Sciences Unit (SSU) which will supervise resettlement activities. The SSU will&#13;
ensure that the affectees, particularly women, small landowners, landless tenants and laborers, fully&#13;
understand their entitlements and the procedures for compensation as provided for under the&#13;
Resettlement Action Plan.&#13;
50.   Role of the Monitoring Consultant. A special external Monitoring Consultant will support&#13;
the Environmental Cell and the Project Resettlement Organization, as required, in monitoring the&#13;
environmental and resettlement aspects of the proposed Project. The Monitoring Consultant will have&#13;
full-time personnel on-site in the project area to support implementation of these activities.&#13;
51.   Role of the Ghazi-Barotha Development Organization.  As per the recommendation of the&#13;
Environment and Resettlement Panel, implementation of the proposed project will include&#13;
development and funding of a Ghazi-Barotha Development Organization (GBDO). The GBDO will&#13;
undertake contacts with the local population, particularly for mattes related to land acquisition and&#13;
compensation. As mandated in the Resettlement Action Plan, representatives of the GBDO will&#13;
participate in Land Valuation Committee meetings to assure that proper procedures are used for land&#13;
acquisition and compensation. The GBDO will also evaluate social trends, identify possible&#13;
mitigation actions and consult with local organizations on their implementation. It will also receive&#13;
funding to implement an Integrated Regional Development Program to support a wide-range of small-&#13;
scale activities to promote "grassroot" economic and social development in the project area.&#13;
&#13;

Page 13 of 27&#13;
52.    Role of the Environmental and Resettlement Panel. The activities of the Environment and&#13;
Resettlement Panel will be continued as an element of the mitigation, monitoring and institutional&#13;
strengthening plan for the proposed project. Members of the panel will make field visits on a&#13;
periodic basis and, where necessary, suggest ways of strengthening the project implementation,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation process. The panel will continue to have three members with Professor&#13;
Kazuyoshi Kawata continuing as the chairman.&#13;
B.    Environment, Resettlement and Cultural Heritage Mitigation Actions&#13;
53.    The direct participation of environmental specialists and social scientists in all stages of&#13;
project preparation have allowed for mitigations to be incorporated into the proposed project at a&#13;
variety of levels. Mitigation of potential adverse environmental and social impacts from the proposed&#13;
project has included direct modification of the original project concept approach through changes in&#13;
the siting of the components, especially the alignment of the power channel, and inclusion of specific&#13;
design provisions to address these issues. There have also been a series of mitigations incorporated&#13;
into the planning and design of the project as presently planned. In addition, the proposed project&#13;
will include mitigation actions which will be implemented during the construction and operational&#13;
phases of the proposed project to avoid or reduce impacts. The actions to be included in the&#13;
Mitigation Plan are summarized in Attachment B.&#13;
C.    Modification of the Project&#13;
54.    Siting. In development of the proposed project, significant attention was given to analysis&#13;
and selection of siting alternatives which resulted in the least possible adverse environmental and&#13;
social impacts. These have included:&#13;
(a)    Barrage and Pond. The decision on siting of the barrage, after review of several&#13;
alternatives, was made to minimize environmental and social impacts directly from the&#13;
barrage and those from the associated power channel offtake;&#13;
(b)    Power Channel. The present alignment of the power channel was developed to&#13;
establish a route, which despite significantly increased construction costs, will have&#13;
the least adverse impact to villages, archaeological and historical sites, religious&#13;
shrines and graveyards. The present alignment was developed by a team of&#13;
engineers, environmental specialists and social scientists on the basis of the study of a&#13;
series of alternative alignments and field surveys. The alignment was subject to&#13;
numerous minor adjustments to avoid a variety of issues identified during field&#13;
surveys and village level scoping sessions. Key features of the alignment include:&#13;
(i)    Resettlement. Development of the alignment has reduced the number of&#13;
parties who need to be resettled to a minimum and it is anticipated that&#13;
resettlement can be accomplished close to the original site of the houses which&#13;
will considerably reduce social impacts. It should be noted, however, that&#13;
implementation of the proposed project will still require taking land for&#13;
construction of the power channel which will require significant measures to&#13;
address the restructuring of the agricultural system in these areas. Issues&#13;
related to resettlement are discussed in more detail below; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-142-                                  ANNEX 6.1&#13;
Page 14 of 27&#13;
(ii)    Archaeological, Historical and Religious Sites. The alignment of the power&#13;
channel was selected to avoid archaeological and historical sites, religious&#13;
shrines and graveyards to the fullest extent possible. As a result, only two&#13;
archaeological sites, Musa I and Musa III, will require salvage excavation and&#13;
three sites will require precautions to avoid accidental burial. No religious&#13;
shrines will be damaged and no major graveyard disturbed. Only one small&#13;
family graveyard with 14 graves and 2 small mosques will need to be&#13;
relocated. Actions to be taken to address these issues are described below;&#13;
and&#13;
(iii)   Kamra Aeronautical Complex. The proposed project will pass through the&#13;
large Kamra Aeronautical Complex; however, extensive analysis of alternative&#13;
alignments resulted in the development of an approach which was acceptable&#13;
to Pakistani military authorities; and&#13;
(c)    Power Complex. Following evaluation of a series of alternative locations for the&#13;
power complex in which environmental and social impact considerations played a&#13;
role, the Barotha site was selected. As a result of a recommendation made during the&#13;
local scoping session, the name of the proposed project was changed from Ghazi-&#13;
Gariala to Ghazi-Barotha to reflect this siting decision. In addition, the layout of the&#13;
complex at Barotha was also adjusted, following field review and consultation with&#13;
local parties, to minimize potential impacts.&#13;
D.    Design Provisions&#13;
55.   Movement in the Project Area. Construction of the power channel will create a physical&#13;
barrier which will require crossings if present transportation routes are to be maintained. In addition,&#13;
access needs to be maintained between villages and their fields. To address this issue, the project has&#13;
included a total of 46 crossings of the power channel, most of which are located at the traditional&#13;
crossing points, which should minimize the impact of the proposed project on pedestrian, livestock&#13;
and vehicular traffic.&#13;
56.   Power Channel Safety. The design of the power channel includes fencing, warning signs,&#13;
floating booms and grab rails for safety purposes. There will be floating booms at bridges and&#13;
superpassages. Grab rails running down both sides of the channel into the water will be at 100 meter&#13;
intervals near villages, but less frequent where the risk of falling into the channel would be less.&#13;
Public education activities to alert residents to the risks of the power channel and proper emergency&#13;
procedures are outlined below.&#13;
E.    Mitigation Actions Incorporated into the Planning and Design of the Proposed Project&#13;
57.   Compensation Water. On the basis of analysis performed as part of the environmental&#13;
assessment, a program has been developed to ensure that adequate compensation water is released&#13;
from the barrage during periods of low flow. These releases will maintain a base flow in the Indus&#13;
river channel for maintenance of water quality and ecology in the channel and provide adequate water&#13;
supplies for human and livestock use in villages along the river bank. The minimum compensation&#13;
flow will be 28 cumecs. When data from the water quality monitoring program indicates the need for&#13;
more flow, it will be released from the barrage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-143-                               ANNEX 6.1&#13;
Page 15 of 27&#13;
58.    Spoil Disposal and Rehabilitation. The balance between excavation and fill will leave about&#13;
70 million cubic meters of surplus material. The majority of this material will be used as&#13;
construction materials for embankments and structures. About 30 million cubic meters will be placed&#13;
in spoil banks to be located at identified sites along both sides of the power channel where this&#13;
material will be placed, graded, covered with topsoil, provided with tubewell irrigation and returned&#13;
to agricultural use. The redevelopment of these areas for irrigated agricultural use will serve as an&#13;
important mitigation action for provision of land to parties who lost land due to construction of the&#13;
power channel.&#13;
F.    Mitigation Actions to be Taken During Project Implementation&#13;
59.    Resettlement Action Plan. The actions to be undertaken by WAPDA to address potential&#13;
resettlement and social issues associated with the proposed project are provided in the Resettlement&#13;
Action Plan (RAP). The RAP makes a commitment to improve or restore the current standard of&#13;
living and earning capacity of the project affected people. This policy commitment has been given&#13;
operational form through the development of entitlement packages (Annex 6.2) which clearly identify&#13;
the types of land loss or disturbance, definition of entitled person, definition of entitlement/right,&#13;
additional facilities and services for project affected people including training, work opportunities,&#13;
credit and provision of local infrastructure.&#13;
60.    Land Acquisition - Valuation and Compensation. Project implementation would require&#13;
the acquisition of approximately 3,457 ha of land from private landowners. The implementation&#13;
authority will purchase all private land for the barrage, power channel, spoil areas, power complex&#13;
and supporting physical and social infrastructure. Compensation for land would be given at current&#13;
market rates, but only after WAPDA completes a field survey to ensure that those who have made&#13;
improvements are fully compensated even if these improvements have not been recorded by patwaris.&#13;
Compensation payments will be prompt and direct, they will be made directly by WAPDA to the&#13;
landholders without any intermediaries. Procedures would be adopted to allow for maximum&#13;
transparency in the valuation and acquisition process. Parties in the project area would be advised of&#13;
the procedures which they could use if they wish to contest an assessment of land value. In order to&#13;
avoid having land out of cultivation for an unnecessary number of seasons after it is purchased but&#13;
before it is actually used by the project, it is proposed to lease it to the farmers for the intervening&#13;
period.&#13;
61.    Replacement of Lost Land for Redeveloped Land. The proposed project would use a&#13;
procedure under which land will be replaced with redeveloped land in the same area to the fullest&#13;
extent possible. This would reduce the potential negative aspects of the proposed project on&#13;
agricultural production and significantly reduce the need for an out-of-area resettlement program&#13;
which is socially less desirable as well as costly. Redeveloped land will be resold at the same rate as&#13;
that at the time of acquisition. Therefore, the farmers will be saving over half of the compensated&#13;
amount, part of which will be spent on development of the land and part will be compensation for&#13;
loss of crops for the period of construction and related activities in the area.&#13;
62.   The land would be sold to affected landholders in the village as soon as it is ready for&#13;
handing over. Under the proposed project, affected parties would have irrigated land replaced with a&#13;
comparable amount of irrigated land while rain-fed land would be replaced with irrigated land at a 2:1&#13;
ratio. Tubewells would be constructed in the redeveloped areas with a normal capacity of 0.25 cusecs&#13;
to provide irrigation water. The tubewells would be provided to the farmers without cost with shares&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-144-                             ANNEX 6.1&#13;
Page 16 of 27&#13;
assigned on a basis equal to their share of land commanded by the well. An agricultural extension&#13;
program would be supported by the proposed project to assist in the formation of water user&#13;
associations and to support the effective use of the redeveloped areas.&#13;
63.   Priority would be given to implement a "pilot program" for the reclamation of spoil banks for&#13;
agriculture. This would allow for detailed field testing of techniques for the cultivation of these areas&#13;
and the development of practical information for agricultural extension personnel.&#13;
64.   Resettlement. The 899 persons which would need to be resettled would be provided with&#13;
compensation for their land consistent with the practices described above. Compensation for housing&#13;
and other buildings would be according to a basic schedule developed by WAPDA based on&#13;
replacement cost. This schedule would be reviewed by the GBDO to ensure that the prices would&#13;
fully reflect replacement costs in the various sections of the project area. It is planned that the&#13;
affected parties would be allocated plots, in the vicinity of their village, which would be a minimum&#13;
of 500 square meters or double the size of the existing house plot, whichever is greater.&#13;
65.   The relocation of housing sites would be coordinated with the allocation of agricultural lands&#13;
to ensure these are near each other. Those villagers who wish to may relocate into either of three&#13;
model villages which have been prepared by WAPDA and whose alternative sites are currently under&#13;
review by WAPDA and the Bank. The project would allow for affected parties to remove the&#13;
remains of their buildings to their new site free of cost. Affected families would be provided with&#13;
vehicles from WAPDA/Government of Pakistan for the movement of their belongings, equipment and&#13;
livestock to the location of their new settlement site.&#13;
66.   Replacement of Existing Facilities and Construction of New Facilities. The proposed&#13;
project would fund relocation and/or replacement of key elements of infrastructure including water&#13;
towers, roads, agricultural buildings, tubewells, etc. New facilities to be supported by the project,&#13;
largely identified as a result of the environmental assessment and resettlement plans include: (a)&#13;
rehabilitation of sewage treatment facilities at the Tarbela Colonies and provision of such facilities at&#13;
Ghazi-Khalo; and (b) a Girls Degree College for Ghazi.&#13;
67.   Employment Preference. WAPDA will give priority in employment to the affectees in the&#13;
construction phase and in filling opening in all job categories in the permanent operations and&#13;
maintenance staff. This would be accomplished by the establishment of a work permit system under&#13;
which WAPDA would distribute permits to those directly affected by loss of land and/or occupation&#13;
for preferential employment. This would include tenants and field laborers who work on land&#13;
acquired for the proposed project.&#13;
68.   Two types of permits would be issued, one for those directly affected and a second for&#13;
residents of affected villages who have suffered a partial loss. It is planned that one work permit per&#13;
household would be issued which would be transferable between members of the same household.&#13;
The work permit would not be treated as an employment contract but as a means for identification of&#13;
those who should receive preference in recruiting employees. A provision for this employment&#13;
preference process has been incorporated into the tender documents for the proposed project.&#13;
69.   Integrated Regional Development Plan. The proposed project would include funding for an&#13;
Integrated Regional Development Plan which would be implemented by the GBDO with the&#13;
cooperation of WAPDA. The development program would be run independently of the main project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-145-                               ANNEX 6.1&#13;
Page 17 of 27&#13;
and would seek to mobilize public and private sources of funds from within and outside Pakistan to&#13;
make investments in the economy of the project area. The program would focus on facilitating the&#13;
economic development of the greater project area through, for example, small-scale inputs for&#13;
development of farmer's marketing organizations and small industrial estates as vehicles for&#13;
development.&#13;
70.    Safety Measures. A comprehensive evaluation of dam safety issues was prepared as part of&#13;
the feasibility study consistent with the provisions of World Bank Guidelines for Safety of Dams and&#13;
Structures (OMS 3.80 and the present revised draft of OP/BP 4.37). The project design includes&#13;
requirements for emergency planning, instrumentation and routine safety inspections during operation.&#13;
In addition, implementation of the proposed project would include adoption of the following safety&#13;
measures to reduce the risks associated with humans and livestock falling into the power channel: (a)&#13;
a public information program will be undertaken to inform the public about the dangers of the channel&#13;
and actions to be taken in case of accidents; (b) a special program will be developed for children&#13;
which will be presented at schools and in villages concerning the risks of the channel; (c) physical&#13;
measures will be included in the project to keep people out of the channel; in populated areas the&#13;
channel will be fenced and warning signs posted; and (d) physical measures will be adopted to get&#13;
people out of the channel who have fallen in or otherwise entered the channel; this will include the&#13;
use of floating booms and grab rails.&#13;
71.   Archeological, Historical and Religious Sites. Mitigation actions to be conducted during the&#13;
project implementation phase include: (a) salvage excavation of the Musa I and Musa III&#13;
archaeological sites; (b) adoption of precautions to avoid accidental burial of Musa II, Pindanwala&#13;
Tibba and an unnamed mound between Rumian and Dakhner; (c) an agreement to be reached with the&#13;
Department of Archaeology and Museums to have staff archaeologists make regular visits during&#13;
excavation activities; (d) adoption of "chance find procedures" to be used if archaeologically&#13;
significant properties are uncovered during the construction activities, which will be included as&#13;
standard provisions in all construction contracts; (e) relocation by WAPDA two smail mosques and of&#13;
14 graves located along the power channel alignment to an adjacent location after obtaining a religious&#13;
pronouncement as required under Pakistani law; (f) notification of village leaders to avoid further&#13;
burials in areas which would be potentially affected by the proposed project; and (g) a minor shrine&#13;
near Galla would be protected by an embankment.&#13;
72.   Public Information Center. WAPDA has established a Project Information Center (PIC) at&#13;
the project site, near Ghazi for the systematic and broad dissemination of all technical environmental&#13;
and resettlement information. The PIC is also a critical part of the communications channel for&#13;
redressing grievances about the land acquisition and compensation process. Since it was established in&#13;
December 1994, the PIC has undertaken and active program of outreach activities to provide&#13;
information to affected parties, local NGOs and governmnent agencies among others on the land&#13;
acquisition and compensation process and entitlement packages. It has commissioned a popular&#13;
film/video on the project, including its environmental and resettlements aspects. It has also prepared,&#13;
with the support of translation consultants, key documents in Urdu, including a schedule of public&#13;
announcement of awards, Urdu translation of the Environmental Assessment Executive Summary,&#13;
entitlement packages and the full Resettlement Action Plan. WAPDA is currently in the process of&#13;
recruiting an expert to be contracted to serve as an advisor to the PIC. The focus of this advisor will&#13;
be to assist in the preparation of written and audio/visual information for the PIC, support outreach&#13;
&#13;

activities for affectees and provide training for PIC staff. It is planned that the PIC would be a&#13;
permanent element of the proposed Project. Two smaller subcenters are being established at Attock&#13;
and Topi.&#13;
G.    Elements of the Monitoring Plan&#13;
73.   The monitoring program for the proposed project would be a continuous program of data&#13;
collection and analysis designed to ensure the effectiveness of the Environment and Resettlement&#13;
Management Plan and to bring to the attention of WAPDA management any environmental or social&#13;
problems which were not identified during the project preparation process. It is planned that&#13;
monitoring reports would be submitted every six months in a format and using indicators which are&#13;
approved by the Bank.&#13;
74.   Environmental Aspects. The following environmental aspects would be monitored under the&#13;
proposed project:&#13;
(a)    Land Resources. The critical areas of land resources requiring monitoring will be&#13;
the spoil areas and the river banks to identify possible excessive erosion, cropping&#13;
problems and failure of the land to reenter the agricultural system. Although the&#13;
project is expected to have a negligible effect on the riverain morphology and&#13;
ecosystem, these aspects will also be monitored.&#13;
(b)    Water Resources. A regular program of water quality analysis will be conducted, in&#13;
cooperation with local and regional health authorities, to ensure than compensation&#13;
water releases are sufficient to maintain dry season water quality in the river&#13;
downstream of the barrage. Groundwater will also be monitored. The most&#13;
important issues included in the monitoring program are the groundwater recharge&#13;
from the barrage pond and the land on either side of the river downstream of the&#13;
barrage, changes in groundwater movement that may be caused by the power channel,&#13;
and seepage from the headponds and the power channel. Moreover, the power&#13;
channel underdrainage system may affect water levels in wells falling within the&#13;
effective zone. All of these aspects will be monitored on a regular basis throughout&#13;
the project life.&#13;
(c)    Biological Resources. The ecosystem of the braided channel zone will be monitored&#13;
to assess the change in plant succession. The grazing trend will also be monitored&#13;
and mitigatory actions taken if deterioration of the ecosystem is observed. The&#13;
monitoring program will include monitoring of fish, other aquatic species, birds and&#13;
other wildlife in the barrage pond, the Indus river below Ghazi, and the headponds&#13;
and adjacent habitat near the power complex.&#13;
(d)    Health Effects. In conjunction with health authorities, health conditions among the&#13;
permanent and temporary residents in the project area will be monitored. A special&#13;
program will be established for mosquito monitoring at the barrage pond and the&#13;
power complex pond. In conjunction with the PNGO, monitoring of the health of&#13;
resettled individuals would be monitored.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

(e)    Archaeological Values. As per the recommendation of the Department of&#13;
Archaeology and Museums, during the excavation of the power channel two&#13;
archaeologists from the Department of Archaeology and Museums will make regularly&#13;
scheduled visits to examine the areas under excavation. In addition, WAPDA and&#13;
Monitoring Consultant personnel will receive guidance concerning the monitoring of&#13;
construction sites to determine if unknown archaeological sites are encountered and&#13;
the appropriate procedures to be taken if such a situation occurs.&#13;
75.   Resettlement Aspects. A number of resettlement aspects would be monitored under the&#13;
proposed project on an active basis to ensure proper implementation of planned actions and to address&#13;
unanticipated problems. The GBDO would monitor the land acquisition and compensation process to&#13;
ensure that each landholder promptly receives the full market value of their holding. Monitoring&#13;
would be done of the process used for leasing temporary borrow areas and assuring proper&#13;
compensation, including quick payment to landholders for inadvertent damage to fields and crops&#13;
from construction activities. There would be active monitoring of the movement of families to ensure&#13;
that replacement is comparable or better than that destroyed. Implementation of the project local&#13;
labor hiring policy would also be monitored to ensure that those directly affected by project activities&#13;
are given priority in hiring and that labor-hiring polices generally benefit the residents of the project&#13;
area.&#13;
76.   A special monitoring activity would be conducted in the Barotha area where the power&#13;
complex is to be constructed. This would include activities to ensure that irrigation is maintained&#13;
along the nullah and that construction activities are avoided in this area. In addition, monitoring of&#13;
the land acquisition process, construction of access roads, work sites, housing areas (temporary and&#13;
permanent), social services and sewage disposal would take place to make certain they comply with&#13;
good practices and do not contribute to the social destabilization of the village.&#13;
H.    Institutional Strengthening&#13;
77.   The proposed project would support the development and strengthening of the Environmental&#13;
Cell of the Water Wing of WAPDA. This would include training on environmental and resettlement&#13;
issues for personnel assigned to both WAPDA headquarters in Lahore and personnel on assignment in&#13;
the project area. The establishment, with project funding, of the Ghazi-Barotha Development&#13;
Organization will also contribute to institutional strengthening by development of a "model&#13;
organization" which could be copied for other major projects in Pakistan to promote social&#13;
development in project areas.&#13;
I.    Special Actions&#13;
78.   The following special actions would be included under the proposed Project:&#13;
*     Conduct special training for WAPDA Environmental Cell and consultant personnel&#13;
concerned with environmental and resettlement issues;&#13;
Hold Pre-Bid Conference(s) and Instructions for Bidders to address environmental,&#13;
resettlement and archaeological issues; and&#13;
Continue Environment and Resettlement Review Panel.&#13;

VII. SUPERVISION AND EX-POST EVALUATION&#13;
81.   Supervision. The supervision plan for the proposed project includes the regular participation&#13;
of Bank environmental specialists and social scientists who would support the task manager in&#13;
overseeing environmental and resettlement aspects of the proposed project. These specialists would&#13;
conduct supervision missions twice yearly to ensure that provisions of the environmental mitigation&#13;
plan, resettlement plan and combined environmental and resettlement monitoring plan are being&#13;
implemented consistent with agreements reached between GOP, WAPDA and the Bank.&#13;
82.   Ex Post Evaluation. The project completion report submitted to the Operations Evaluation&#13;
Department will include an evaluation of: (a) environmental aspects of the project and assessment of&#13;
their impact and the effectiveness of various types of mitigation measures; (b) resettlement and its&#13;
impact on tne standard of living of the resettled population and those who have land taken by the&#13;
proposed project; and (c) effectiveness of the project in supporting the development of a capacity&#13;
within WAPDA to better manage activities with major environmental and resettlement issues.&#13;

Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower Proiect&#13;
Water and Power Development Authority&#13;
Social and Environmental and Resettlement Monitorin2&#13;
Terms of Reference for Monitoring Consultant&#13;
1.    Introduction.  The Ghazi Barotha Hydropower Project is a major run-of-the-river&#13;
environmentally sustainable power project, designed to meet the acute shortage of power in&#13;
Pakistan. The Project will utilize the fall of about 76 meters in the Indus river between the&#13;
tailwaters of Tarbela Dam and the confluence of the Indus and Haro rivers.  It involves&#13;
construction of a barrage near Ghazi village located about 7km downstream of Tarbela Dam, to&#13;
divert water into a 52 km power channel. The power channel would convey water to a power&#13;
complex of 1450 MW, comprising five units each of 290 MW installed capacity near the village of&#13;
Barotha to generate about 6600 GWh of energy annually. A 500 kV transmission line and related&#13;
substation would connect the power complex to the Peshawar grid substation. The project&#13;
location and layout plans are illustrated in drawings 1 and 2.&#13;
2.    Environmental Aspects. The proposed project has been subject to the preparation of an&#13;
environmental assessment consistent with the procedures of the World Bank and the requirements&#13;
of the Government of Pakistan(GOP) Ordinance XXXVII, 'Control of Pollution and&#13;
Preservation of Living Environment (December 1983)." The project preparation process included&#13;
the adoption of a number of design modifications to mitigate potential adverse impacts through&#13;
careful siting of the principal components of the project and in establishing the alignment of the&#13;
power channel. Under the current project design, potential environmental impacts include: (a)&#13;
changes in land use in areas acquired for construction of the barrage, reservoir, power channel&#13;
and power complex; (b) reduction in the flows of a small portion of the main channel of the upper&#13;
Indus River, immediately below the Tarbela dam, when the power complex is in operation; (c)&#13;
impacts to two minor archaeological sites in the power channel which would be subject to salvage&#13;
excavation; (d) relocation of 14 graves; (e) potential risks of persons and livestock being killed or&#13;
injured if they enter or fall into the power channel; and (f) safety issues associated transmission&#13;
lines. To address these issues an environmental mitigation and monitoring plan has been prepared&#13;
which would be implemented by the Environmental Cell of the Water and Power Development&#13;
Authority (WAPDA). An Environmental Assessment Executive Summary has been prepared by&#13;
WAPDA and endorsed by GOP.&#13;
3     Resettlement Aspects. The proposed project requires the acquisition of approximately&#13;
4,770 hectares of land, 3457 hectares of which are privately owned. All of the privately owned&#13;
land will be acquired; but as 1,640 hectares would be needed temporarily, these lands would be&#13;
provided with irrigation facilitates and offered for sale at reduced prices to the affected persons.&#13;
The total number of persons adversely affected by the loss of land, houses, and employment is&#13;
&#13;

4.     The electricity sales forecasts are based on demand growth of 10% per&#13;
annum in line with 10-yr. historical sales of WAPDA between 1984-1994.&#13;
Estimated losses are projected based on actual losses in December 1994&#13;
(24.2%), and assuming a gradual reduction from FY96 resulting from reduction&#13;
in non-technical losses and gradual decrease in technical losses as a result&#13;
of  WAPDA's  loss-reduction  program  agreed  with  the  ADB.    Private  sector&#13;
purchases are based on the following capacity additions from the private&#13;
sector:&#13;

Average Revenue per kWh Sold&#13;
4.    The average revenue per kWh sold include the unit base tariff plus the&#13;
fuel adjustment surcharge.   Tariff increases  are projected to achieve the&#13;
average revenue required to meet both the 40% Internal Cash Generation&#13;
covenant and the Debt Service Coverage covenant of 1.5 times.&#13;
Fuel Adjustment Surcharge (FAS)&#13;
5.    The FAS rate as set by the government is 75 paisas/kWh for all consumers&#13;
except for the first three blocks of domestic consumers which pay a lower&#13;
rate, and flat rate agricultural and Federally Administered Tribal Areas&#13;
consumers which are exempt. From FY97, the FAS rate is assumed to recover at&#13;
least 100% of WAPDA's total fuel cost.&#13;
Other Operating Revenues&#13;
6.    Other operating revenues consist of income and fees for items such as&#13;
transfer/replacement of meters, application fees, reconnection of service,&#13;
etc.   These revenues are shown to increase minimally based on prior years&#13;
revenues.&#13;
Hydroelectric Profit Surcharge and Payments to the Provinces&#13;
7.    A surcharge on all electricity sales is levied by WAPDA on behalf of the&#13;
Government to help pay for hydroelectric profit payments due to the Provinces&#13;
in accordance with a formula set by the National Finance Commission.   The&#13;
surcharge amounted to Rs. 4.3 billion (10.4% of sales) in FY94.  The Federal&#13;
Government paid the difference between the revenues from the surcharge and the&#13;
actual  payments  during  that  year  (Rs.  6.0 billion) .   From  FY97,  WAPDA's&#13;
hydroelectric profit payments are assumed to be paid by WAPDA in full.&#13;
Fuel Costs&#13;
8.    Fuel costs, fuel prices and projected consumption are based on WAPDA's&#13;
estimated actual average fuel cost and consumption in FY95 for its thermal&#13;
generation, with estimated increases in fuel prices of 16.6% in FY96 (actual),&#13;
and 7% thereafter.&#13;
Maintenance Expenses&#13;
9.    Maintenance expenses are related to plant in service and are forecast at&#13;
1.5% of average gross fixed assets in operation.&#13;

Operation and Administration Expenses&#13;
10.   Operation  and maintenance  expenses  are  forecast  to  increase  by  13%&#13;
annually, taking into account system expansion, inflation and past experience.&#13;
During FY98 and FY2001, an additional increase of 7% is assumed to account&#13;
for general wage increases granted to Government employees.&#13;
Depreciation&#13;
11.   WAPDA applies a composite rate of depreciation of 3.5% to its average&#13;
gross fixed assets in operation.&#13;
Balance Sheet&#13;
Cash&#13;
12.   Cash balances are projected at the level required to cover at least six&#13;
weeks of cash operating expenses.&#13;
Inventories&#13;
13.   Inventories are forecast at 6% of gross fixed assets in operation.&#13;
Accounts Receivables&#13;
14.    WAPDA's overall accounts  receivables have been projected at 20% of&#13;
billings equivalent to 2.4 months' sales based on actual experience.&#13;
Other Current Assets&#13;
15.   Other current  assets  include miscellaneous  receivables,  advances  and&#13;
clearing accounts.   These are forecast to increase by 5% annually based on&#13;
past experience.&#13;
Current Liabilities&#13;
16.   Current liabilities include accounts payable, deposits for works to be&#13;
carried  out  for  other  agencies,  contractor  deposits,  duties  payable  and&#13;
accrued salaries. Current liabilities are assumed to be 70% of current assets&#13;
(other than cash) from FY97.&#13;
Security Deposits&#13;
17.   Security deposits are forecast to increase at 5% per annum.&#13;
Sources and Uses of Funds&#13;
Consumer Contributions&#13;
18.   Consumer capital contributions consist of payments for connection costs,&#13;
including cost of conductors, meters and transformers for large consumers.&#13;
These are assumed to be 9% of WAPDA's investments.&#13;

Investment Program&#13;
19.   WAPDA's investment program includes investments for generation plants,&#13;
transmission and distribution expansion and rehabilitation.   The investment&#13;
program is reviewed with the Bank annually and adjusted to reflect revised&#13;
commissioning dates, local and foreign cost variations, and financing&#13;
availability.&#13;
Borrowing&#13;
20.   These are projected on the basis of WAPDA's capital investment program.&#13;
Forty percent of the capital investment program are assumed to be financed&#13;
from  internal  cash  generation.    Projections  assume  that  local  currency&#13;
borrowings are from WAPDA 10-Yr. bond flotations, and all foreign costs of the&#13;
investment program financed from foreign loans.&#13;
Debt Service&#13;
21.   New debt is assumed to have the following terms: local borrowing through&#13;
bonds  at  19% interest,  repayable  after  10 years.    Regular  sinking  fund&#13;
appropriations are assumed to cover the repayment at maturity date or are&#13;
rolled-over.   Foreign borrowings are assumed at the weighted average cost of&#13;
WAPDA's foreign borrowings.&#13;
Escrow Account&#13;
22.   An escrow account representing two months' purchase payments for private&#13;
power sector has been established by WAPDA in accordance with the power&#13;
purchase agreements with the independent power producers. The escrow account&#13;
is treated as a fund application.&#13;

Least Cost Analysis&#13;
A. Load Forecast&#13;
1.    The load forecast for the Pakistan system has been developed on the basis&#13;
of an econometric partial adjustment model developed by ADB\1, which&#13;
desegregates for the following consumer categories: residential, commercial,&#13;
industrial, and agriculture.   The adjustment period varies for each consumer&#13;
category and it's in the range of 1.0 to 2.2 years.  The model explains the&#13;
energy demand for each consumer category as dependent on the following variables:&#13;
(a) income, (b) own-electricity price, (c) price of alternative fuel, and (d)&#13;
load shedding.   On the basis of historical data,  the model estimates the&#13;
elasticities related to each of the above independent variables. The projections&#13;
of these independent variables are then imposed to the model to derive the&#13;
electricity demand forecast for each consumer category.&#13;
2.    Three macroeconomic  scenarios,  presented in Attachment  1, have been&#13;
formulated and used in the analysis. The three scenarios are the following: (a)&#13;
High scenario, which is predicated on deepening and fully implementing the&#13;
macroeconomic reform program, (b) the Base Scenario, which assumes some reforms&#13;
and slower implementation, and (c) the Low scenario, based on little reform&#13;
combined with external difficulties. The Base scenario envisages an average rate&#13;
of GDP growth of 5.7% per year during the period FY95-2004, and a constant rate&#13;
of 5.5% for the remaining period. Under the Low and High scenarios, the average&#13;
rate of GDP growth is 4.5% and 6.7% per year respectively for the period FY95-&#13;
2004, and 4.5% and 7% thereafter.&#13;
3.    Electricity price projections are in line with the assumptions used in the&#13;
financial analysis, and assume a gradual elimination of the cross-subsidies to&#13;
agriculture and residential consumers. Fuel price projections are based on World&#13;
Bank projections\2  (see Attachment  2) .   Load shedding  is expected to be&#13;
gradually reduced, and eliminated by FY2002, as a result of increase in supply&#13;
capacity along with improvements in supply efficiency, and demand-side management&#13;
measures, as described below.&#13;
4.    Transmission and distribution losses are assumed to decrease from the FY94&#13;
level of 22.71W, to 18.5t in FY2000, 16W in FY2010, and 14% in FY2020, as a&#13;
result of the ongoing loss reduction program in WAPDA's system, and continuous&#13;
efforts to reduce the level of non-technical losses. An aggressive Demand-Side&#13;
Management Program, consisting of pricing (e.g., time-of-use tariffs), and non-&#13;
pricing measures (e.g., ripple control, efficiency and conservation activities)&#13;
are expected to result in demand savings of about 1000MW by FY2002, and about&#13;

4000MW in FY2010, depending on the penetration rate of such measures.   As a&#13;
result of the above, the system load factor is estimated to improve from the&#13;
level of 65.25% in FY94, to 67% in FY2000, and to 70.5% in FY2010.&#13;
5.    Electricity demand after DSM is thus expected to grow at the average growth&#13;
rate of about 8.8% during the period FY94-2002 and 6.6% between FY2002-2020 or&#13;
an average of 7.3% during the period FY1994-2020 for the base case scenario. Due&#13;
to the reduction in losses, and the impact of DSM, the resulting peak demand is&#13;
expected to increase at the average annual rate of about 6.6% for the FY94-2020&#13;
period, and in particular at 7.8% for the period FY94-2002 and 6.1% for the&#13;
period FY2002-2020. These projections are in line with the ones used by WAPDA&#13;
under the National Power Plan (NPP), which forecast an overall growth rate of&#13;
energy demand of 7.5% without DSM program and 7.2% with DSM for the whole period,&#13;
and a load growth of 7.4% and 6.7% respectively.&#13;
B. Characterization of the existing svstem&#13;
6.    Existing and committed hydropower and thermal plants belong to WAPDA and&#13;
KESC with the exception of the Hub Project (1292MW), at present under&#13;
implementation, which is in the private sector.&#13;
7.    The main hydropower plants (Tarbela, Mangla, and Warsak), along with small&#13;
hydropower plants  (96MW),  belong to WAPDA.   The total combined hydropower&#13;
capacity at the beginning of the study period is 4814MW.   The total peaking&#13;
capacity at full storage level is 5146MW. An additional ongoing project, Chasma&#13;
Barrage with a capacity of 184MW is scheduled to be completed in FY1998.&#13;
8.    Given its stochastic nature, the hydrology is represented in the WASP III&#13;
model, into three hydro conditions: (30%) dry, (40%) average, and (30%) wet. The&#13;
capacity and energy available for each hydroelectric project is specified in each&#13;
hydro condition.&#13;
9.    The existing thermal power plants in the Pakistan system account for&#13;
7055MW, mainly dual fired (natural gas and fuel oil) . WAPDA and KESC have 1347MW&#13;
of ongoing committed projects, which are expected to be commissioned by FY97.&#13;
In addition, the first private sector power generator (Hub Project) with an&#13;
installed capacity of 1292MW, is expected to be commissioned in FY98.&#13;
Candidate Generating Units for System Expansion&#13;
10.   Hydropower candidate projects.  Several promising hydroelectric projects&#13;
are characterized for analysis of the national system. All proposed hydropower&#13;
projects included in the analysis have been studied at prefeasibility level&#13;
(Basha, Kohala, and Tarbela 4th extension), and at feasibility stage with&#13;
detailed engineering design for Ghazi Barotha and Kalabagh.   These projects,&#13;
whose main characteristics are described in Table 1, form part of the sequence&#13;
used in the analysis.   Further,  in the sensitivity analysis  (see Section F&#13;
below), a group of other hydropower projects identified in a study carried out&#13;
with the assistance of GTZ has been included as alternative sequence.&#13;
11.   In order to characterize the hydropower system for this study, certain&#13;
assumptions made by WAPDA under the NPP have been revised and more conservative&#13;
assumptions compared to the ones used by WAPDA have been adopted.   First, a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-188-&#13;
ANNEX 8.1&#13;
Page 3 of 11&#13;
minimum 10% of inflow energy is assumed for all hydro projects (the NPP input&#13;
data assumes 0.0 minimum energy for any month). This modification reduces the&#13;
flexibility in the operation of the hydropower plants, as a minimum outflow is&#13;
assumed to be always required for purposes such as preservation of flora and&#13;
fauna, irrigation, etc. Second, WAPDA adopts an integrated hydrological model&#13;
which allows to optimize the power and energy from each hydropower plant given&#13;
the irrigations constraints incorporated into the model. In other words, WAPDA&#13;
hydrological model assumes a synchronized hydrological system which would allow&#13;
to optimize water releases from each reservoir and barrage, while, at the same&#13;
time, optimizing the energy and power from each hydropower project. This has a&#13;
particular positive impact on the outflows from Tarbela, which determines the&#13;
inflows to the Ghazi Barotha project, by allowing a higher level of water&#13;
releases from Tarbela during the dry period viz-a-viz the average and wet&#13;
periods.    While  the mission  does not  discard  the possibility of  such&#13;
optimization, a more conservative approach has been adopted: the energy and power&#13;
which can be produced by GBHP are based on the historical water release from&#13;
Tarbela in the last few decades.&#13;
12.   Finally, in this study a more conservative set of assumptions has been&#13;
included as regards the costs of the candidate hydropower projects, as&#13;
illustrated in Table 1.&#13;

compensation and rehabilitation, as well as the cost of transmission lines. The&#13;
environmental cost estimate are more complete for some projects, such as GBHP and&#13;
Tarbela 4th extension, while for others, such as Kalabagh and Basha (for which&#13;
detailed environmental and resettlement studies have not been undertaken), the&#13;
available information has been updated and additional estimates have been&#13;
included.&#13;

ANNEX 8.1&#13;

Thermal Candidates&#13;
14.   Thermal candidates include new thermal projects such as Gas Turbines, Steam&#13;
Plants, and Combined Cycle Plants which would be built-owned and operated by the&#13;
private sector (IPP) in accordance with the 1994 Power policy.   In order to&#13;
characterize such projects in the least-cost analysis, the capacity and energy&#13;
charge provided for in the power policy have been included (see Table 2).&#13;
However, in order to ensure consistency with the discount rate used in the least-&#13;
cost analysis, such payments have been capitalized at the beginning of the period&#13;
at the prescribed discount rate of 10%, and re-calculated on annual basis at 12%&#13;
discount rate.  Further the fuel cost included in the energy charge has been&#13;
separated in order to adjust it according to the fuel price projections, as&#13;
indicated in the power policy. A common feature of the IPP under the 1994 power&#13;
policy is the efficiency benchmark of 38.6%.  The policy prescribed the bulk&#13;
tariff on the basis of such efficiency, thereby providing a financial incentive&#13;
to private investors to increase this efficiency level.   This implies that&#13;
regardless the type of fuel, private sector power plants will be remunerated on&#13;
the basis of the benchmark efficiency, and the implied technology (steam plant)&#13;
In this study, the base case includes base-load plants using fuel oil.&#13;
15.   The 1994 power policy has been conceived for base-load power plants, which&#13;
are normally characterized by higher capital cost and lower energy cost compared&#13;
to peaking-load plants. In this analysis, Gas Turbines have been included as&#13;
candidate projects, but their cost has been expressed as capital cost and O&amp;M&#13;
charges, rather than as a capacity and an energy charge. Such representation has&#13;
the advantage of being more conservative. Further, it provides an indication of&#13;
the maximum tariff which could be offered to private power investors for gas&#13;
turbines by assessing their benefits in the system.&#13;

16.   Other Private Power Plants. Since March 1994, with the announcement of the&#13;
1994 power policy, GOP has issued Letters of Support (LOSs) to private power&#13;
project proposals for about 9000MW. Some of these projects are at advanced stage&#13;
of preparation, while others appear to lag behind the tight schedule imposed by&#13;
the Government (one year from the date of issue of the LOS to reach financial&#13;
closure). For the purpose of this analysis, some of these projects have been&#13;
represented in the WASP III model on the basis of the available information&#13;
related to their technical characteristics and other preliminary contractual&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 8.1&#13;
Page 5 of 11&#13;
C. Economic Assumptions and Constraints&#13;
17.   The discount rate used in the analysis is 12%, which is the estimated&#13;
opportunity cost of capital. Fuel prices include inland transportation costs and&#13;
margins, and are escalated in real terms according to World Bank projections.&#13;
18.   Given GOP's objective of reducing load shedding as soon as possible, WAPDA,&#13;
in formulating the assumptions for the least-cost analysis of the system, imposes&#13;
a maximum reliability criterium (LOLP) of 1%, i.e. 3.65 days a year.   Such&#13;
criterium appears reasonable, also when considered that it is higher compared to&#13;
the ones adopted in North America and in Western Europe, and in other developing&#13;
countries, e.g., Thailand uses 3 days a year. The imposition of a reliability&#13;
criterium is usually made in alternative to the expected cost of unserved energy,&#13;
i.e. the expected damages to the economy when a certain amount of electrical&#13;
energy is not supplied. WAPDA adopts a cost of unserved energy of US$0.27/Kwh.&#13;
The present level of outage is not, however, an equilibrium level and the high&#13;
degree of load shedding has led to consumers taking steps to ameliorate the&#13;
effects of load shedding. This leads to a lower unit cost of outages than in an&#13;
entirely reliable system. Therefore, the outage cost of US$0.27/Kwh estimated&#13;
by WAPDA is most probably a reasonable level until reliability improves. In the&#13;
Energy Options Study, the cost of unserved energy has been estimated at&#13;
US$0.75/Kwh. For conservative purposes, the present analysis assumes a cost of&#13;
unserved energy equivalent to US$0.27/Kwh.&#13;
D. Base Case Sequence&#13;
19.   The least-cost generation expansion program (LCGEP) for the period FY94-&#13;
2020 formulated on the basis of the above outlined assumptions is presented in&#13;
Table 3. Upto FY2002, it includes GBHP and 5202MW of new thermal power projects,&#13;
besides the ongoing and committed WAPDA and KESC projects and Hub. This implies&#13;
that over 70%- of private thermal power projects for which LOSs have been issued&#13;
by GOP are required along with GBHP. The results of the analysis also indicates&#13;
that, by FY2002, 300MW of Gas Turbines, which are assumed to utilize expensive&#13;
diesel oil, should be installed. GOP should, therefore, consider the promotion&#13;
of two or three peaking-plants.   After FY2002, the LCGEP selectes all other&#13;
hydropower projects, that is: Kalabagh, Tarbela 4th extension, Kohala, and Basha.&#13;
The total Net Present Cost at 12% discount rate is US$32,824 million.&#13;
20.   An alternative base case, without GBHP, has been developed in order to&#13;
quantify the direct benefits to the power system attributable to the proposed&#13;
project. In this case, the LCEGP replaces GBHP with 2x6OOMW IPPs, and 2xlOOMW&#13;
Gas Turbines in FY2002. The Net Present Cost (at 12% discount rate) associated&#13;
with this case without GBHP is US$33,281 million, or US$457 million higher than&#13;
the Base Case with GBHP. The annual cost difference between these two LCGEPs,&#13;
without and with the project, provides an initial indication on the economics of&#13;
GBHP viz-a-viz the alternative projects. The resulting ERR is 339.&#13;

E. Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
21.   Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the robustness of the LCGEP,&#13;
and in particular of GBHP. Revised assumptions related to the LOLP criterium,&#13;
the availability of Gas Turbines, a higher discount rate, cost overruns were&#13;
considered on the Base Case. Further, the other two load forecasts, Low and High&#13;
scenarios, were developed. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed on the&#13;
number of thermal power projects to be commissioned by FY2002 for the three load&#13;
forecast scenarios in order to test the robustness of GBHP.   The results are&#13;
summarized in Table 7 and detailed below.&#13;
22.   Sensitivity Analysis on the Base Case.   A sensitivity analysis was&#13;
developed to test the robustness of GBHP to change in assumptions related to (a)&#13;
unconstrained LOLP criterium, (b) the availability of Gas Turbines, (c) a&#13;
discount rate of 15%, and (d) +23 percent higher capital cost for GBHP. In each&#13;
of the above cases, the results of the LCGEP analyses indicates that GBHP is&#13;
always required at the earliest commissioning date (FY2002).&#13;
23.   In particular, the assumption of LOLP unconstrained in conjunction with a&#13;
conservative estimate of the cost of unserved energy (US$0.27/Kwh) translates&#13;
into a lower number of IPPs (4300MW) required by FY2002, equivalent to almost 60%&#13;
of private thermal power projects for which LOSs have been issued by GOP. In&#13;
case no Gas Turbines were allowed in the system, the Net present Cost (at 12%&#13;
discount rate) associate with this LCGEP is US$320 million higher than the Base&#13;
Case with Gas Turbines. The use of a higher discount rate penalizes large-scale&#13;
projects,  which are capital intensive and with long gestation period.   The&#13;
results of a LCGEP carried out with a discount rate of 15%, compared to the&#13;
estimated opportunity cost of capital of 12%, and the same amount of IPPs&#13;
(5202MW) as in the base case is required by FY2002.   As the economic cost&#13;
attributed to GBHP in the Base Case is US$1,732 million, which includes physical&#13;
contingencies for about 10%, a capital cost of US$2123 million (equivalent to 23%&#13;
higher cost than the base case, or 35% of the base cost without physical&#13;
contingencies) was attributed to GBHP. The results of the LCEGP indicate that&#13;
the same amount of IPPs (5200MW) as in the Base Case are required by FY2002 along&#13;
with GBHP.&#13;
24.   Given the uncertainties related to the number of private power projects for&#13;
which LOSs have been issued by GOP, an analysis has been carried out to test the&#13;
robustness of GBHP to increasing level of private power projects. For the Base&#13;
load forecast, the results are the following: (a) if one additional IPP (600MW,&#13;
for a total of 5800MW - 64% of proposed projects) is added in FY2001, there are&#13;
no changes in the GBHP schedule, (b) if two additional IPPs (1200MW, for a total&#13;
of 6400MW - 71% of proposed projects) are added in FY2001, GBHP is delayed by one&#13;
year to FY2003, (c) if three IPPs (1800MW, for a total of 7000MW - 78% of&#13;
proposed projects) are added in FY2001, GBHP is delayed by one year in FY2003,&#13;
and (d) if four IPPs (2400MW, for a total of 7600MW - 84% of proposed projects)&#13;
are added in FY2001, GBHP is postponed by two years in FY2004.&#13;
25.   Sensitivity Analysis on the Low Forecast Scenario.   The results of the&#13;
LCGEP analysis for this case are summarized in Table 7. The program shows that&#13;
GBHP is still required in FY2002.   This scenario require a lower level of&#13;
capacity of private power projects, i.e., 3100MW by FY2002, compared to the Base&#13;
case. Further, + 40% higher capital cost were attributed to GBHP in order to&#13;

test the robustness of the project.  Again the results indicate that GBHP is&#13;
still required at its earliest commissioning date.&#13;
26.   Sensitivity Analysis on the High Forecast Scenario.  The results of the&#13;
LCGEP analysis for this case are summarized in Table 4. The program shows that&#13;
GBHP is still required in FY2002.   This scenario require a higher level of&#13;
capacity of private power projects, i.e., 7202MW by FY2002, compared to the Base&#13;
Case.&#13;

F. Sensitivity Analysis on SHYDO Hydropower Protects&#13;
27.   GTZ and the Sarhad Hydroelectric Development Organization  (SHYDO) has&#13;
recently conducted a desk-top level inventory study of the hydropower potential&#13;
of the northern areas of Pakistan.   Under the study, the following fifteen&#13;
hydropower candidates have been identified: Karrang (453.5MW), Kai Gah (548.5MW),&#13;
Duber (comprising Patan (111MW) and Moze (11.1MW), Spath Gah - Tokyae - Chor&#13;
Nalla (comprising Spath - Chor Nalla (818.9MW) and Tokyae (31.9MW), Allai IV&#13;
(124.4MW), Besham (66.3MW), Swat Scheme Al (104.7MW), Swat Scheme Bl (428.5MW),&#13;
Naran (219.3MW), Suki Kinari (651.8MW), Kotli-2  (104.1MW), Sehra-1 (67.3MW),&#13;
Chakothi (139MW), Hari Gel (53.8MW), and Neelum-Jhelum (576MW). Some of those&#13;
projectes are run-of-river type, while others are reservoir type. The earliest&#13;
commissioning date for these projects varies between FY2002 and FY2010.&#13;
28.   Although a comprehensive data base (including some hydrological data) has&#13;
been developed, more information is required to consider these projects at par&#13;
with the already identified hydropower projects in the base case. For example,&#13;
no data related to land acquisition, resettlement, environmental mitigation costs&#13;
is available. More detail work is needed for the selection of design parameters,&#13;
including an assessment of seismic risks and several other design parameters,&#13;
according to site conditions.&#13;
29.   However, for the purpose of confirming the absolute economic integrity of&#13;
GBHP, a sensitivity analysis of the Base Case with the SHYDO projects, as&#13;
characterized in the available reports,  has been carried out.   The LCGEP&#13;
indicates that, under the assumptions provided by SHYDO, those projects are&#13;
competitive compared to thermal power plants. The results also indicate that,&#13;
when those projects are competing with GBHP, the latter is still selected in&#13;
FY2002.   The total net present cost at 12% discount rate is US$425 million&#13;
compared to the Base case without SHYDO projects.   This confirms that the&#13;
overall, SHYDO projects are not competitive with the other hydropower projects,&#13;
and in particular with GBHP.&#13;
30.   An additional sensitivity analysis was developed by replacing the hydro&#13;
sequence including Ghazi Barotha, Kalabagh, Basha, etc., with the SHYDO projects.&#13;
Again, the LCGEP selects almost all SHYDO hydro projects (fourteen out of&#13;
fifteen) . The total net present cost at 12% discount rate is US$33,232 million,&#13;
or US$408 million higher than the Base case excluding SHYDO projects.   This&#13;
demonstrates that the SHYDO projects, even at the preliminary costs and&#13;
conditions identified at desk-top level, are not comparable with GBHP. Finally,&#13;
the above analysis was developed under the low demand scenario.   The results&#13;
indicate that, under the above conditions, the commissioning date of GBHP would&#13;
be delayed by one year.&#13;
31.   The above analysis demostrates that,  under the available information&#13;
provided by SHYDO, these projects appear to be attractive from an economic point&#13;
of view. However, their availability does not affect the economic viability of&#13;
Ghazi Barotha.   It is therefore suggested that more work be carried out to&#13;
investigate the feasibility of these projects to determine their economics and&#13;
their environmental impact.&#13;

Small Hydropower Schemes&#13;
32.    Under  Technical  Assistance   provided   by   the   Bank,  a   report  on   the&#13;
"Feasibility of Setting up 100 Small Hydel Schemes in NWFP" was finalized in July&#13;
1987.    The  hydro  schemes  are  located  in  six  districts  of  NWFP, Abbottabad,&#13;
Mansehra, Kohistan, Dir, Swat and Chitral. A total potential of about 75MW was&#13;
identified  through  100  schemes.   Sixty-three  schemes  are  situated  at  remote&#13;
locations,  at  least  10  miles  from  the  grid.   Given  their  size  and  incomplete&#13;
information available, such schemes cannot be included in the present analysis.&#13;
Certainly, their size indicates that they cannot compete with the GBHP. However,&#13;
it is suggested that more work be carried out to investigate the feasibility of&#13;
these schemes, particularly in the context of an optimal rural electrification&#13;
plan.&#13;

Economic Rate of Return Analysis&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    In order to determine the economic viability of the proposed project, two&#13;
different methodologies have been applied. The first is the standard methodology&#13;
adopted by the Bank in power projects. It is based on the evaluation of costs&#13;
and benefits associated with the overall power investment program including the&#13;
project. Such approach better reflects the interdependence of a power system.&#13;
The second methodology is based on the evaluation of costs and benefits&#13;
associated directly with the project.   Such methodology is required because&#13;
hydropower projects tend to be more susceptible to delays and cost overruns than&#13;
smaller  thermal projects.   Such approach,  however,  requires  to formulate&#13;
simplified assumptions regarding the specific contribution of the project to the&#13;
benefits to the economy. For each methodology, this Annex describes assumptions&#13;
and results of the Economic Rate of Return and Risk analyses.&#13;
Economic Analysis on the Power Investment Proaram&#13;
Main Assumptions&#13;
2.    The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) has been calculated on the basis of the&#13;
incremental cost and benefit streams associated with the national least-cost&#13;
investment program for the period FY1994-2006 of which GBHP is an integral part&#13;
(see Annex 8.1).  Benefits are represented by the incremental demand that can&#13;
be served under this program compared to the lower level of demand that could be&#13;
served if no new supply capacity were added to the power system. Similarly, the&#13;
costs are the difference between power system costs for meeting demand with this&#13;
program (FY1995-2006) and the system costs without any investments in new supply&#13;
capacity  and  related  transmission  and  distribution  facilities.    As  the&#13;
investments related to ongoing and committed projects between FY1994 and FY1999&#13;
are the same for both with and without program case, the net costs used to&#13;
calculate the ERR are the investments associated to uncommitted and new projects&#13;
between FY1999 and FY2006. The choice of the year 2006 as upper date has been&#13;
made in order to exclude from the calculation of costs and benefits the other&#13;
hydropower projects which could be commissioned starting FY2007.&#13;
3.      Benefits are valued as the difference between the benefits with and&#13;
without the program, i.e., the incremental demand that is met under this program&#13;
(1994-2006) relative to the much lower level of demand that could be served if&#13;
no new capacity were added to the power system.  The sequence related to the&#13;
period includes the following projects: (a) for the period between FY1995 to&#13;
FY1999, ongoing projects of WAPDA (1117MW), and KESC (210MW), in parallel with&#13;
Hub (1292MW) . Further, in order to meet system requirements, it was assumed that&#13;
other private power projects (2500MW) would be implemented by FY1998, (b) between&#13;
&#13;

FY1999-2006, GBHP (1450MW), and the following private power projects: llx6OOMW&#13;
base load plants and 6xlOOMW peaking-load plants.&#13;
4.    Local costs are converted to border prices by using a Standard Conversion&#13;
Factor (SCF) of 0.822 in FY95, increasing to 0.901 in FY1998 and remaining&#13;
constant  thereafter,  in  line  with  the  macroeconomic  projections.    Such&#13;
projections are in line with the macroeconomic assumptions used as a basis for&#13;
the formulation of the load forecast, which reflect the expected gradual&#13;
liberalization of Pakistan's trade policy regime.&#13;
5.    The costs associated with the power investment program includes: (a) the&#13;
costs of generation, transmission and distribution facilities to be undertaken&#13;
by WAPDA and KESC; (b) an estimate of the capital cost/' of private power&#13;
generation projects  (US$1000/Kw) /2, including an estimate of the additional&#13;
transmission costs required to connect them to the grid; (c) the operations and&#13;
maintenance costs for WADPA and KESC, estimated as a percentage of the cumulative&#13;
investments in transmission (2%) , and distribution (3%), and for generation, the&#13;
O&amp;M provided by the least-cost generation expansion program; (d) fuel costs for&#13;
WAPDA's and KESC's thermal power plants, as well as for private thermal power&#13;
plants escalated on the basis of the World Bank energy price projections, which&#13;
assume a real price increase of about 17% by FY2005 and constant thereafter, and&#13;
(e) energy purchases from private thermal power projects, i.e., energy charge as&#13;
dispatched.   The same cost categories have been calculated for the "without&#13;
program" case. the difference between the costs of the "with program" case and&#13;
the "without program" case represents the incremental costs of meeting the&#13;
electricity demand forecast.&#13;
6.    Transmission and distribution losses are assumed to constantly decrease&#13;
during the period of analysis from an average of 22.7% in FY94 to 18.5% in&#13;
FY2000, to 17% in FY2006. This is due to an ongoing and future transmission and&#13;
distribution technical loss reduction program, and to an assumed reduction in&#13;
non-technical losses.&#13;
7.    Since the major investments in the power development program have economic&#13;
lives that stretch well beyond FY2006, a run-out period of 25 years is added to&#13;
the costs and benefit streams for computing the ERR in which costs and benefits&#13;
are maintained at the levels for FY2006.&#13;
1/    Under the 1994 Power Policy, WAPDA and KESC will pay an annual capacity&#13;
charge which has been determined on the basis of capital costs,&#13;
financial charges including Interest During Construction, and a rate of&#13;
return on equity. In the least-cost analysis, such capacity charge has&#13;
been included as a fixed operating cost, to better represent the cost to&#13;
WAPDA and KESC of buying power from the private sector, and to reflect&#13;
the actual dispatch of the system. For the purpose of the economic&#13;
analysis, financial charges, and rate of return should be excluded.&#13;
Further, private power projects are to be considered as investments to&#13;
be funded at the beginning of the period of analysis.&#13;
2/    This capital cost reflect a conservative estimate, more compatible for&#13;
steam plants (among the different private sector projects there are&#13;
combined cycle plants with a lower capital cost).&#13;

8.    The economic benefits associated with the power investment program are the&#13;
values of the incremental sales made possible by implementing the proposed long-&#13;
term development program. From FY1999 onwards, WAPDA and KESC would be able to&#13;
increase their sales, even in the without program case, due to a more intensive&#13;
use of the available capacity. In order to take into account these factors, the&#13;
results of the optimization model developed under the without program case, have&#13;
been incorporated into the economic analysis.&#13;
9.    The  valuation  of  benefits  derived  from  incremental  sales  has  been&#13;
desegregated by consumer categories namely, residential, industrial, agriculture,&#13;
and others (which include commercial, public lighting, bulk, and traction) . For&#13;
the evaluation of the benefits, a distinction has to be made between consumers&#13;
already connected to the system by FY1998, and new consumers that are first&#13;
connected from FY1999 onwards.   In the without program case, the incremental&#13;
consumption of existing consumers (no new consumers are assumed to be connected&#13;
to the system, as neither WAPDA and KESC will have adequate supply capability)&#13;
is a function of the overall income growth of the Pakistan economy.&#13;
10.   For the calculation of the benefits, a disaggregation of projected sales&#13;
for each consumer category has been done by developing a spreadsheet model of&#13;
projected sales as a function of the following:&#13;
*     overall sales growth,&#13;
-     the rate of new connections,&#13;
the projected tariff levels needed to meet WAPDA's financial objectives&#13;
and a gradual elimination of cross-subsidies (through price elasticity of&#13;
category demand),&#13;
the projected growth in incomes (through income elasticity of projected&#13;
demand), and&#13;
-     the build-up rate of consumption from new connections.&#13;
Combination of values of these factors (for which assumptions have been made) was&#13;
chosen to calibrate the total desegregated sales to the projected overall path&#13;
of sales, so as to make the benefits evaluation derived from the model consistent&#13;
with the projected sales.&#13;
Benefits Evaluation&#13;
11.   Benefits to Residential Consumers.  The increase in population growth is&#13;
expected to decline from the present 3% to 2.89 in FY2000, and 2.52% thereafter.&#13;
Given the average GDP growth rate between FY1994-2006 of about 5.6% for the base&#13;
macroeconomic scenario, the resulting GDP per capita is expected to increase at&#13;
the average of about 2.9% p.a. during the same period. This growth rate, which&#13;
has been adopted as proxy for the annual growth in household income, is&#13;
equivalent to an increase in real household income of 40% between FY1994 and&#13;
FY2006. This assumes no change in average household size.&#13;
12.   In the last 12 years, new connections in the residential sector increased&#13;
at the average of about 400,000 per year. However, during the last seven years,&#13;
new connections averaged 453,000 a year.   For modelling purposes, during the&#13;
period FY1994-2006, new connections to households are assumed to increase at the&#13;
average of about 660,000 per year. Such a rate of new connections appears to be&#13;
sustainable over a medium term, given that, at present, less than half of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-200-                            ANNEX 8.2&#13;

Pakistan population has access to electricity. The other assumptions used for&#13;
the modelling of residential sales are the following: a price elasticity of -&#13;
0.35, and electricity price in real terms for households almost doubling upto&#13;
FY2006; an income elasticity of 2.6 between FY94-2000, and 1.8 between FY2001-&#13;
2006; and an average consumption rate of 1967kWh/year for a mature consumer.&#13;
13.   Valuation of the benefits for new residential users is divided into the&#13;
following two components: (i) substitution of existing methods of lighting&#13;
(kerosene lanterns) by electric lighting, that is resource cost savings; and (ii)&#13;
the consumers' surplus derived from the additional quantity of electricity above&#13;
the substituted level caused by the large drop in the price of energy that comes&#13;
with a switch from non-electrical method of lighting to electric forms.&#13;
14.   The results of the Household Energy Strategy Study indicates that the&#13;
average consumption of kerosene per non-electrified household in Pakistan is&#13;
about 60 litres/year (of which over 98% is primarily used for lighting purposes).&#13;
This result, combined with field observations, suggests that a non-electrified&#13;
household consumes on average an equivalent 42kWh/year of kerosene lantern,&#13;
equivalent to an annual expenditure of about Rs. 850 (or an average cost of&#13;
Rs.20/Kwh). This estimates identifies the resource cost savings associated to&#13;
a new connection.&#13;
15.    The consumption rate for a mature connection at the prevailing tariff&#13;
identifies the upper limit at the margin of total consumption. In FY1999, this&#13;
point is defined by Rs.1.3/Kwh (the projected tariff in 1994 prices) and 2525kWh.&#13;
The benefits associated to such induced consumption (consumers' surplus), are a&#13;
function of the area under the user's demand curve for electricity. In other&#13;
words, consumers' surplus for each user depends on the shape of the demand curve.&#13;
Under the modelling of residential sales, it was assumed that a semi-log demand&#13;
curve/ passes through the two points described above. The choice of a semi-log&#13;
form has the advantage of estimating on conservative basis the consumers surplus&#13;
from the use of electricity.&#13;
16.   However, given the income effect created by the large drop in the price of&#13;
energy, an adjustment to the demand curve is necessary in order to avoid an&#13;
overestimate of the consumers'  surplus.   Thus,  the demand curve has been&#13;
recalculated to take into account such compensating variation for the consumer.&#13;
On the assumption of a linear relationship between the level of electricity&#13;
consumption and household income, this adjustment factor is 0.87.&#13;
17.   Benefits to Industrial and other sectors.   The basis for valuing the&#13;
benefits of post-1998 incremental sales to industrial and other users, i.e.,&#13;
agriculture, commercial, bulk supply, etc., is the cost that these users would&#13;
incur if they had to meet their electricity needs by investing in and operating&#13;
diesel generators on their own premises, instead of being able to take supply&#13;
3/    The semi-log form is:&#13;
Q = A + B ln P&#13;
where A is a positive constant and B is a negative constant. The&#13;
adoption of a straight line curve would overestimate the consumers'&#13;
surplus.&#13;
&#13;

from WAPDA and KESC. That is, an avoided user cost has been used as proxy for&#13;
this class of consumers.&#13;
18.   Industrial consumers are divided into two categories: small users with 1lkW&#13;
ginset and an annual consumption of 22886kWh, and medium- and large users with&#13;
a 500kW ginset and an annual consumption of 55592kWh. Excluding amortization of&#13;
capital costs, the cost per equivalent unit of electricity (which includes fuel&#13;
and operating expenses) amount to Rs.5.59/Kwh and Rs.4.79/Kwh for small- and&#13;
medium/large size industrial consumers respectively.&#13;
19.  Agricultural consumers utilize using diesel oil tubewells as alternative&#13;
to electricity. According to field observations provided by WAPDA, most of the&#13;
tubewells use low speed diesel oil, and the average rating of the diesel pump is&#13;
19HP with a utilization factor of 32.5%. The equivalent amount of electricity&#13;
corresponds to 22886kWh.   Under these assumptions,  the cost per unit of&#13;
electricity equivalent (excluding depreciation) is Rs.4.35/Kwh.&#13;
20.   For the "others" consumer category including commercial, bulk consumers,&#13;
public lighting and traction, an avoid cost average between small industry,&#13;
residential and agricultural has been calculated. The assumed average annual&#13;
operating time is 2320 hours per year, and the cost per equivalent unit of&#13;
electricity is Rs. 4.96/Kwh.&#13;
Economic Rate of Return for the Base Case&#13;
21.  The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for the base case is estimated at about&#13;
27% based on the methodology and assumptions outlined in the previous sections.&#13;

22.    Sensitivity Analysis.   A sensitivity analysis on the base case has been&#13;
carried out to test the robustness of the ERR of the proposed development program&#13;
to less favorable scenarios regarding increase in program costs (including GBHP),&#13;
delay in implementation of the program, decrease in benefits, and combinations&#13;
of  these  events.    Further,  a  sensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  on  the&#13;
additional amount of capacity (MW) from private power projects commissioned&#13;
during the period, particularly by FY2002.&#13;

27.   Under the High Load forecast, the ERR is estimated at about 32%.   A&#13;
sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the robustness of the ERR to a 20%&#13;
increase in capital cost of the program. The resulting ERR is about 28%&#13;
Risk Analysis&#13;
28.   Introduction.  The sensitivity analysis has demonstrated that the ERR of&#13;
the proposed development program is robust to uncertainties related to capital&#13;
costs, delay in program schedule, and to combinations of the above. The analysis&#13;
has also demonstrated that the ERR is well above the opportunity cost of capital&#13;
under different assumptions regarding the amount of additional capacity assumed&#13;
to be installed by the private sector. However, the number of risks that are&#13;
extraneous to the project design are numerous. Given that a combination of such&#13;
risks could occur, a probabilistic approach in evaluating the economics of the&#13;
proposed development program is warranted.&#13;
29.   This approach assigns probabilities to the different scenarios so that a&#13;
weighted average ERR can be obtained. In this way, each scenario is not treated&#13;
as a simple alternative of any other, as is the case for the sensitivity&#13;
analysis, but provides a good understanding of which outcome is more or less&#13;
likely.    Finally,  such  risk  analysis  allows  to  construct  a  probability&#13;
distribution of ERRs.&#13;
30.   Demand Profiles.   The probability to be attached to each macroeconomic&#13;
scenario, on the basis of which the demand forecast is formulated, is subject to&#13;
change depending on the new developments in the country. Nevertheless, the Base&#13;
scenario, i.e. gradual pace of reforms and uneven progress across different&#13;
components of the program is much more likely to materialize than either the High&#13;
scenario,  i.e.,  deep  reforms  implemented  in  a  timely  fashion  across  all&#13;
components of the program, or the Low scenario, i.e. serious policy slippage.&#13;
Therefore the probabilities associated with the underlying macro and structural&#13;
policies in each scenario (from which certain key outcomes such as the rate of&#13;
growth of GDP, inflation, trade performance, etc. are derived), are the&#13;
following: 50 percent for the Base scenario, 25% for the Low scenario, and 25%&#13;
for the High Scenario.&#13;
31.   Cost Profiles.  The risk analysis considers two scenarios with respect to&#13;
cost overruns for the power system development program. As regards investments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-204-                            ANNEX 8.2&#13;

in generation, which account for about 56 percent of the total investments during&#13;
the period FY1994-2006, a distinction should be made between GBHP (the only new&#13;
public sector investment) and private thermal power projects. The advanced level&#13;
of preparation of GBHP, and the conservative cost estimates included in the&#13;
analysis, as also demonstrated by the recent results of two of the main three&#13;
bids, would suggest to assume moderate probabilities on cost overruns for this&#13;
project. GBHP investments account for about 10 percent of the total cost of the&#13;
power program FY95-2006, and about 18 percent of the generation capital cost in&#13;
the same period. Based on the above, the following probabilities for the cost&#13;
profile for GBHP have been assumed: 20 percent no cost overrun, 40 percent with&#13;
cost overrun of 15 percent, and 40 percent with cost overrun of 30 percent.&#13;
32.   Given the increasing private sector investments  in the power system&#13;
(accounting for about 68 percent of total generation cost during the period), it&#13;
is unlikely that cost overruns could affect other generation projects. However,&#13;
a distinction needs to be made between private generation projects, and ongoing&#13;
public sector projects (accounting for about 14 percent of total generation&#13;
investments in the period). For the private sector investments, the following&#13;
probabilities have been assigned: 60 percent with no cost overrun, 30 percent&#13;
with 15 percent cost overrun, and 1.0 percent with 30 percent cost overrun. For&#13;
ongoing public sector projects, the following probabilities have been assumed:&#13;
40 percent with no cost overrun, 50 percent with cost overrun of 15 percent, and&#13;
10 percent with cost overrun of 30 percent.&#13;
33.   Similarly  to  other  public  sector  projects,  the  implementation  of&#13;
transmission and distribution investments (accounting for about 44 percent of the&#13;
total program cost in the period)  could be subject to cost overruns.   The&#13;
following probabilities have been therefore utilized: 40 percent probability of&#13;
no cost overruns, 50 percent probability of cost overruns of 15 percent, and 10&#13;
percent probability of cost overruns of 30 percent.&#13;
34.   Based on the incidence of each of the above component in the investment&#13;
program for the period FY1995-2006, the following weighted probabilities have&#13;
been utilized: 45 percent probability of no cost overruns, 40 percent probability&#13;
of cost overruns of 15 percent, and 15 percent probability of cost overruns of&#13;
30 percent.&#13;
35.   Schedule Profile.   The risk analysis of schedule delay in the power&#13;
development program is similar to the one discussed above for the cost overrun&#13;
scenarios.   However, in order to take into account possible difficulties in&#13;
securing the financing requirements for private sector projects, a higher&#13;
probability has been attached to a two year delay in the program. Therefore, the&#13;
following probabilities have been utilized:&#13;
no delay      (40%)&#13;
1 year delay (40%)&#13;
2 year delay (20%)&#13;
36.   IPP.  As of March 1995, 32 projects with a combined capacity of about&#13;
9000MW were supposed to be commissioned in the next few years, including an&#13;
agreement with a private sector group for the implementation of power generation&#13;
complex of 1240MW based on imported coal. A recent analysis on those projects&#13;
carried out in collaboration with the Government, and in consultation with&#13;
representatives of private sector investors involved in those projects, concluded&#13;
that about 1600MW of those projects are very likely to be commissioned by FY1998,&#13;
and an additional 1000-1500MW could be commissioned by FY2000. The prospects for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-205-&#13;
ANNEX 8.2&#13;
Page 9 of 12&#13;
the remaining projects being implemented are considerably lower. This is because&#13;
several LOSs were issued to sponsors with uncertain capability of implementing&#13;
their projects. Further, only limited debt financing is likely to be available&#13;
due, in part, to the Pakistan country risk perception from lenders, and the&#13;
country credit ceiling from both export credit agencies and multilateral&#13;
institutions.&#13;
37.   Notwithstanding the above analysis, the least-cost analysis (see Annex 8.1)&#13;
has demonstrated that the minimum additional private power generation required&#13;
by the system by FY2002 is 3100MW (Low Scenario). Therefore, as the purpose of&#13;
this analysis is to assess the robustness of the proposed program to&#13;
uncertainties in the number of thermal power projects to be implemented, 3100MW&#13;
has been taken as the minimum expected additional capacity. Based on the above&#13;
considerations and analysis, the following probabilities have been therefore&#13;
assigned to additional capacity of private power projects:&#13;
3100MW (50%)&#13;
5200MW (40%)&#13;
7200MW (10%)&#13;
38.   Risk Analysis: Results.  On the basis of the above analysis, there are four&#13;
factors, i.e., demand, schedule profile, cost overruns and number of private&#13;
power projects, each with three alternative states. The total possible number&#13;
of outcomes is thus fifty-four. For each outcome, the expected value of the ERR,&#13;
calculated as probability times its own ERR, is then summed over all outcomes to&#13;
give the expected ERR. A probability distribution of ERR has been calculated,&#13;
and shown in Fig. 8.1.&#13;
39.   The expected value of the ERR is 18%, which is lower than the ERR of the&#13;
Base case (27%), but still higher than the opportunity cost of capital.  The&#13;
probability of being below 12 percent is 8%. The histogram of the ERRs presented&#13;
in Fig.  8.1  (probability distribution of ERR)  indicates  that the highest&#13;
probability is associ.ated with ERRs in the range of 16% to 23% (combined&#13;
probability of  over  55%),  followed by ERR between  12%  to  15%  (combined&#13;
probability of about 25%). The remaining 18% is distributed between very high&#13;
ERRs above 24% (about 10%) and ERRs less than 12% (8%).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 8. 2&#13;

40.   It should be noted that under the Base and High demand scenarios, the&#13;
probability of ERR lower than the opportunity cost of capital is zero, even under&#13;
the most unfavorable combinations of higher capital costs, delay in the schedule,&#13;
and increasing number of private power plants. The 8 percent probability of ERR&#13;
being below 12% is mostly attributable to a combination of Low demand scenario,&#13;
30 percent higher capital cost, and two year delay in the implementation of the&#13;
program.&#13;
41.   A sensitivity analysis has been carried out on the probabilities attached&#13;
to the capital cost, schedule and demand risks (see Table 6) . The results again&#13;
confirms that the weighted-risk ERR is around 171-18%, and the risk of falling&#13;
below 12% is in the range of 10%, mostly attributable to a combination of the&#13;
above greater risks with a Low demand scenario.&#13;

Economic Analysis on Ghazi Barotha alone&#13;
42.   Introduction and Main Assumptions. Hydropower projects are generally more&#13;
prone to cost overruns and schedule delays than smaller thermal power projects.&#13;
Thus, in order to more directly assess the impact of these adverse events on the&#13;
economic viability of Ghazi Barotha, a separate economic analysis has been&#13;
developed for the project alone.  The ERR is calculated on the basis of the&#13;
incremental cost and benefits streams associated with the implementation of the&#13;
project.&#13;
43.   The costs associated with GBHP consist of the estimated capital costs and&#13;
related operating and maintenance costs calculated as a percentage of the capital&#13;
costs (one percent) . Benefits are valued in terms of the incremental demand that&#13;
can be served by the project. Such demand has been calculated on the basis of&#13;
the average annual electricity generated by the project less the transmission and&#13;
distribution losses.  The valuation of the benefits derived from incremental&#13;
sales has been desegregated by consumer categories, i.e., residential,&#13;
industrial, agricultural, and others, according to their shares in the demand&#13;
forecast.   The methodology utilized to estimate benefits for each consumer&#13;
category is almost identical to the one adopted in the previous analysis on the&#13;
power investment program. New consumers are assumed to be connected to the grid&#13;
as a result of the implementation of the project, on the basis of their&#13;
proportion in overall demand, and their average consumption in FY2002.  This&#13;
connection program is assumed to be implemented in four to five years.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 8.2&#13;
Page 11 of 12&#13;
44.   ERR and Sensitivity Analysis.  The results indicate that the estimated ERR&#13;
is about 30%.  Such estimate is consistent with the results of the economic&#13;
analysis on the power investment program, as GBHP is more economical than the&#13;
thermal power plants representing the bulk of the generation investment program.&#13;
The estimated ERR is independent from the demand scenario adopted, as the least-&#13;
cost analysis has demonstrated that even under the Low scenario, GBHP is required&#13;
at its earliest completion date.&#13;
45.   A sensitivity analysis has been developed to determine the robustness of&#13;
the economics of the project to changes in cost profile and schedule.   The&#13;
results, which are presented in Table 8 below, show that the ERR is always above&#13;
20 percent.&#13;

with cost overrun of 30% and 2 year delay           20.65%&#13;
46.   Risk Analysis.  Based on the methodology and similar assumptions adopted&#13;
for the power investment program, a risk analysis on the GBHP alone has been&#13;
developed. While the scenarios identified in the previous analysis are the same,&#13;
a different set of probabilities and risks have been identified for this&#13;
analysis. In particular, a higher cost overrun risk and a schedule slippage risk&#13;
have been assigned to the project alone, given its riskier nature compared to the&#13;
overall power investment program. The new scenarios and probabilities are given&#13;
below:&#13;
Cost Overruns                                Schedule Slippage&#13;
No Cost Overruns  probability I0.20          No Delay  probability  0.20&#13;
+15% Cost Overruns  probability = 0.40       1 Year Delay  probability = 0.40&#13;
+30% Cost Overruns  probability = 0.30      2 Year Delay  probability = 0.30&#13;
+40% Cost Overruns  probability = 0.10      3 Year Delay  probability = 0.10&#13;
47.   The risk-weighted ERR for the project alone is estimated at about 23%, and&#13;
its probability of falling below the opportunity cost of capital is zero. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-208-                         ANNEX 8.2&#13;
Page 12 of 12&#13;
is because under any unfavorable scenarios considered, the ERR remains above the&#13;
level of 18%. The least-cost analysis (see Annex 8.1) has demonstrated that,&#13;
even under the Low demand scenario, GBHP is selected at its earliest completion&#13;
date. Thus, the adverse impact derived from a combination of high cost overruns&#13;
and schedule delay, though in evidence, does not affect the overall viability of&#13;
the project. The probability distribution of ERR on GBHP alone is shown in Fig.&#13;
2 below.&#13;

            Pakistan - Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main objectives of the Ghazi-Barotha
            Hydropower Project are to assist the government of Pakistan
            (GOP) in its efforts to: 1) develop domestic energy
            resources and reduce load-shedding in a cost-effective and
            environmentally sustainable manner, thereby supporting the
            country's long-term energy development objectives; 2)
            reinforce and complement the reform program for the power
            sector; 3) strengthen the Water and Power Development
            Authority's (WAPDA) capability to address environmental
            and resettlement issues related to hydropower projects; and
            4) further rationalize the use of electricity. The project
            will consist of: 1) the construction of the Ghazi Barotha
            Hydropower Project (GBHP) which comprises the following four
            main components: a) a barrage and its ancillary works; b) a
            52 km long concrete-lined power channel with a capacity of
            1,600 cumecs and its ancillary works; c) a power complex and
            its ancillary works; and d) the construction of power
            transmission facilities to connect GBHP to the
            interconnected grid; 2) the implementation of an environment
            and resettlement management plan including: a) an
            environment mitigation and monitoring plan; b) a
            resettlement action plan (RAP); and c) and integrated
            regional development plan (IRDP); 3) the power sector
            component which involves setting up of GBHP as a separate
            project entity and the establishment of a separate
            transmission and despatch entity; and 4) a technical
            assistance component consisting of consultancy services.
