Inadequate sanitation threatens the sustainability of the Philippine environment and the health of Filipinos.&#13;

               ilipinos die of diarrhea everyday and sanitation-related epidemics have broken out over the last&#13;
few years in low income communities. Water quality monitoring assessments show that pollution of water is a&#13;
direct result of the lack of sanitation facilities. This results in over Php 67 billion in estimated annual losses to the&#13;
econom in avoidable health care costs and losses in tourism and fisheries receipts.&#13;
  onomy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Philippines Clean Water Act (R.A 9275), passed last year, is a quintessential piece of legislation that was&#13;
designed to address the interlinked problems of water quality, pollution prevention and control and sanitation.&#13;
The law calls for a comprehensive and integrated approach to water management and overturns the prevailing&#13;
policy that sanitation is merely a household responsibility. It directs national and local governments to work&#13;
together in ensuring adequate provision of municipal sanitation systems. It calls for a strategic approach to&#13;
planning and managing water resources within a basin, which includes the institution of systems and regulations&#13;
related to wastewater management. It complements other laws and policies, such as the Sanitation Code (PD 856),&#13;
already in place for many years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
One of the key sector limitations, however, is the gap in knowledge and experience among policy-makers and&#13;
the handful of sanitation practitioners, both at national and local levels, on strategic sanitation planning and&#13;
alternative options for sanitation, wastewater collection and treatment. Between the on-site combination of a&#13;
toilet and septic tank system and the traditional sewerage and treatment systems, a vacuum of information&#13;
exists on other options available and their relative performance. Information on the sanitation and wastewater&#13;
management requirements of varying types of communities and user-enterprises is also lacking. These missing&#13;
pieces of information are necessary to underpin strategic sanitation planning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This Sanitation Sourcebook is a first attempt at addressing the gap in information about sanitation and&#13;
wastewater management, as well as about the considerations related to planning for sanitation projects in&#13;
different types of environment. It distills some of the core concepts of sanitation in a user-friendly format so&#13;
that the book can serve as a practical reference to sanitation professionals and investment decision-makers,&#13;
particularly the local governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In putting together this important reference, the Government of the Philippines has been supported by the&#13;
Water and Sanitation Program ­ East Asia and the Pacific of the World Bank, the German Technical Cooperation&#13;
Agency and the Government of Australia. Their support and guidance, along with those of the peer reviewers&#13;
who have contributed professionally to this book, are much appreciated. We look forward to the application of&#13;
the knowledge embodied in this book towards the improvement of sanitation throughout the country.&#13;

FOREWORD&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation presents one of the most significant service delivery challenges related to poverty alleviation and&#13;
sustainable development in the Philippines. A review of the urban sewerage and sanitation sector through&#13;
the Water Supply and Sanitation Performance Enhancement Project (WPEP) confirmed the prolonged lack of&#13;
investment in the sector and the deteriorating quality of sewerage and on-site sanitation facilities throughout&#13;
the Philippines. Except in parts of Metro Manila and a handful of cities, the lack of sewerage and other sanitation&#13;
services leaves the population with few options for safe excreta and wastewater disposal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
High hygiene awareness among urban and rural residents, even among the poor, is not translated to effective&#13;
demand or health-benefiting practices due in part to the sheer lack of options to improve their access to&#13;
sanitation services.   Financing conventional sanitation improvements is viewed by local governments and&#13;
enterprise managers to be too expensive and beyond their reach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Consequently, an overwhelming majority are excluded from service, while affluent and middle income urban&#13;
residents depend on self-provided toilet and septic tank systems. Exclusive housing estates and other commercial&#13;
establishments sometimes invest in independent sewerage and communal septic tank systems. But dependence&#13;
on self-provision results in a reduction of the potential revenue base of sanitation service providers. In addition,&#13;
the efficacy of such systems is not monitored well and, in many cases, offer only inadequate primary treatment of&#13;
wastewater. The poor have even fewer options.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Sanitation Sourcebook aims to stimulate effective demand for sanitation services by presenting tools for&#13;
strategic decision-making around a wider range of more affordable sanitation options. It also hopes to stimulate&#13;
informed investment decisions by local governments to ensure more sustainable outcomes. Thus, it features&#13;
environment-friendly and affordable decentralized solutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Interest in sanitation and information on such solutions were demonstrated during the highly successful 1st&#13;
International Symposium on Low-Cost Technology Options for Water Supply and Sanitation in Bohol in 2004. This&#13;
event was also jointly organized by our agencies to ignite and facilitate dialogue among stakeholders, users and&#13;
different donor organizations in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We, the international support agencies involved in the development of this Sourcebook are very pleased with the&#13;
ownership of and inputs from the national government agencies that have worked with us on this project, as&#13;
well as with the strong partnership among the various donors, sanitation professionals in the peer review panel&#13;
and the Philippine Ecological Sanitation Network, and with the collaborating sanitation investment projects and&#13;
organizations. Collaboration and partnership have been the mark of this project from its inception, and we hope&#13;
that this will continue into the future&#13;

to help project planners, enterprise managers, local               options spanning the major components of sanitation&#13;
executives and other members of the community                      infrastructure systems and shows their various&#13;

It responds to a need identified during a scoping                  project planners assess different options. The chapter&#13;
study to present sanitation and wastewater concepts                starts with a discussion of factors relevant to decision-&#13;
and technology in a comprehensive, yet simple way.                 making. Factors are classified as either restricting or&#13;

1.3 Water-Reliant and Non-Water                                                     Figure 1-3 illustrates the polluting components of&#13;

In general, sanitation systems are either water-reliant                             Table 1-1 discusses this in more detail.&#13;
or non-water reliant. Water-reliant systems employ water&#13;
to flush and convey waste through the system and                                                                 Figure 1-3&#13;

water reliant systems are those that rely on dry storage&#13;
and carriage that does not employ water for conveyance.&#13;
Thus, carriage is usually conducted manually. It does&#13;
not mean that liquid waste or even, clean water, is not&#13;
received in the system. A small amount of water may be&#13;
employed to clean components of a dry system, such&#13;
as the sitting bowl. A vacuum flush toilet, such as those&#13;
employed in airplanes, can thus be considered non-&#13;
water reliant.&#13;

In the past, population density was low, and the                                                                       that do not get excluded.&#13;
distinction between rural and urban was much more&#13;
defined. Household sanitation facilities could exist as                                                                The second step in decision-making is a review&#13;

consideration of technical and non-technical issues.                                                                   and deliberations among project stakeholders.&#13;

use a facility and pay for its continuing use.                                                             infrastructure, such as the collection and treatment&#13;

Cost to Investors and Users&#13;
One part of the `demand' equation is the cost of                                                           Depending on what percentage of costs is ultimately&#13;

Another part of demand relates to the perception of                                                are willing to pay for specific goods and services&#13;

Often, however, consumers will have limited                                                        prepared to pay for a service or improvement.&#13;

Thus, in investigating the consumers' willingness to pay,&#13;
it is important that consumers understand the costs and                                        In conducting willingness to pay investigations, it is&#13;

    A simplistic way of measuring the willingness of                                           planners respond effectively through promotion&#13;
    consumers to pay is by equating it with affordability.                                     (demand-creation), appropriate financing incentives/&#13;
    This is usually measured by the cost of various options                                    programs and product development.&#13;
    as a percentage of household income. The threshold of&#13;

    Another method is to find out what consumers are                                           or decrease the motivation of consumers to invest&#13;
    already paying for in terms of similar or alternative                                      in sanitation, use the facility properly, or pay for its&#13;
    services; for example, what people pay for in                                              maintenance and operation:&#13;
    environmental fees, for the use of public toilets or to                                    a. Consumer knowledge of&#13;

    Alternatively, observations can be made about what                                                  of inaction, lack of sanitation or poorly&#13;

    or to obtain them; for example, the time, money and                                                 different options available to address sanitation&#13;

As discussed in Chapter 1, wastewater from enterprises&#13;
such as hospitals and public markets needs to be                                                                   The domestic wastewater streams from these establishments,&#13;

cases, wastewater first undergoes pre-treatment to                                                                 pre-treatment, can be treated the same way as household&#13;

wastewater streams are collected and managed                                                                       become relevant.&#13;
separately from domestic waste streams. For hospitals&#13;
and public markets, the Sourcebook includes Preliminary&#13;
Matrices 2-2 A (Public Markets) and 2-2 B (Hospitals)&#13;
which present pre-treatment options for the various&#13;
waste streams.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In the case of public markets, wastewater from meat&#13;
and fish processing will have higher organic and protein&#13;
content than wastewater coming from houses. In the&#13;
case of hospitals, components of wastewater will need&#13;
to undergo pre-treatment as they typically contain&#13;
chemical, toxic or pathological elements. Pre-treatment&#13;

      Intensive sensitization campaigns may need to precede sanitation programs in these conditions; embarrassing or difficult discussions about unsanitary hygiene practices (such as&#13;
      open defecation) need to be started&#13;
      Willingness of local governments to provide drainage and solid waste management services could be used as an entry point for encouraging more comprehensive approaches to&#13;
      sanitation in these communities&#13;
      One area that needs particular attention is what can be done to increase access by very poor families to toilet facilities ­ sharing arrangements with neighbors, incremental&#13;
      improvements or communal facilities may need to be considered&#13;
      Awareness and skills of septic tank masons and persons responsible for operating and maintaining water supply and sanitation facilities within the community need to be improved&#13;
      Ecological and dry sanitation systems as well as cartage can be considered&#13;
      Rewards and penalties may need to be introduced for improvement of sanitation facilities or behaviors&#13;

&#13;
    Hazardous waste streams need to be separately collected and treated; otherwise, all waste streams must be fully treated&#13;
    In the absence of strong regulatory enforcement, creative financing solutions need to be developed to facilitate investment in sanitation. These can include solutions already&#13;
    emerging, such as the development of common facilities or service provision by a third party as an alternative to hospitals owning and maintaining their own treatment facilities&#13;
    and financing incentives, which might be more sustainable in the long run&#13;
    Regulatory standards and enforcement need to be clarified and improved&#13;
    If hospitals will do the treatment themselves, skilled workers need to be employed&#13;

Description:   A compost privy is similar in structure to a pit latrine or aqua privy with some variations like sloping floor and liquid storage. It receives the feces, urine,&#13;
               anal cleansing materials with the addition of other organic matter such as garbage, leaves and grass. Biological decomposition takes place inside the privy&#13;
               producing humus called "compost".&#13;
&#13;
               Variations of compost privy include: Clivus Multrum Single-Vault Composting Toilet (Sweden), Biopit Composting Toilet (Sweden), Vietnamese Compost&#13;
               Latrine, Minimus Composting Toilet (Philippines), Comportalet or Composting Portable Toilet (Philippines), Multichamber Carousel Composting Toilet&#13;
               (Norway), Sirdo Seco Double-Vault Composting Toilet (Mexico), CCD Toilet (South Pacific Islands), Movable Bucket/Bin Composting Toilet (Norway), Aquatron&#13;
               System Composting Flushed Toilet (Sweden).&#13;
&#13;
Design:        The volume of the pit depends on the needs for fertilizer and the     Operating           Composting involves the biological degradation of the organic&#13;
               needs of people using the privy. Proportion of excreta to refuse      Principles:         compounds of wastes which have relatively high concentration&#13;
               (organic matter) should be about 1 to 5 by volume. Usual Carbon                           of solids. Initially, psychrophilic and mesophilic bacteria (10-40&#13;

               year is used for calculating the volume of the pit, but using 0.1 to                      heat. The temperature rises until it limits the growth of the&#13;
               0.15 m3/person/year is more realistic.                                                    mesophilic bacteria. The temperature then begin to drop, the&#13;
                                                                                                         mesophilic bacteria take over again as decomposition approaches&#13;
               Another way of calculation is by the formula                                              completion. Length of time for the decomposition process is&#13;
                        V = 1.33 x N x R x P                                                             not fixed. Sludge in open compost piles/windrow is composted&#13;

Description:   A pit latrine consists of a hole in the ground covered with either a squatting plate or a slab provided with riser and seat. A housing or toilet room is built&#13;
               over the pit. A pit latrine operates without water. Liquid portion of the excreta soaks away into the soil. The VIP is a pit latrine with a screened vent installed&#13;
               directly over the pit. The vent provides odor control and the screen on top of the vent prevents entry of insects attracted by the smell. Filled pits are&#13;
               covered with soil for composting. There are two types of VIP latrines: single pit and alternating-pit. For the latter, there are two adjacent pits below the toilet&#13;
               room and one pit is used at any given time. When one pit becomes full, it is closed and the other pit is used. By the time the second pit becomes full, the&#13;
               first has fully decomposed and becomes innocuous. Materials in the filled pit are removed and the pit can then be returned to service till it becomes full.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Description:    The conventional aquaprivy is essentially a small septic tank located directly below a squatting plate which has a drop pipe extending below the liquid level&#13;
                in the tank to form a simple water seal. To prevent odor, fly and mosquito nuisance in the toilet, the water seal has to be maintained by adding sufficient&#13;
                water per toilet visit to the tank via the drop-pipe to replace any losses. The excreta are deposited directly into the tank where they are decomposed&#13;
                anaerobically similar to a septic tank. A housing or shed is built over the tank. A vent pipe with a fly screen at the top end is attached to the housing. A&#13;
                water-tight tank is desirable to minimize losses. An effluent (overflow) pipe is installed above the level of the drop-pipe.&#13;
&#13;
Design:         Design considerations are as follows:                                  Operating             The tank must first be filled with water up to the level of the&#13;
                1.   Tank volume calculated on 1.5 liters per day plus 4.5 liters/     Principles:           outlet pipe. After 6-8 weeks, the decomposition process will attain&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Description:   The pour-flush toilet has a bowl with a water-seal trap. It is as hygienic as the conventional tank-flush toilet and requires only a small volume of water for&#13;
               flushing. Human waste or excreta is flushed with water poured into the bowl with a pail or scoop. Various types of bowls are commercially available. The&#13;
               bowl can be set in place with the concrete slab cover of the pit or septic tank or offset and pipe-connected to the pit or tank. The toilet can be within the&#13;
               house or a separate structure can be built outside. A pour-flush bowl can be used with compost privy, VIP, aquaprivy or public toilet.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Description:   A UDDT is a waterless toilet system allowing the separate collection and on-site storage or treatment of urine and feces. Urine is separated in a urine&#13;
               separation toilet and collected in a container. Feces are dropped into a ventilated collection chamber where they are dried and stored. Dried feces and&#13;
               stored urine can be reused in agriculture. No liquids infiltrate into the subsoil, thus there is no danger of groundwater contamination. The most common&#13;
               type of UDDT uses the double-vault system, where two collection chambers for feces are in alternating use. Other variations include single-vault systems&#13;
               and movable container systems.&#13;

Description:   A modified sewerage system which operates as conventional sewers with a number of modifications; the minimum diameter (small bore) and the&#13;
               minimum cover are reduced, the slope is determined by using the tractive force concept rather than the minimum velocity comcept, sewers are installed&#13;
               below sidewalks or inside private properties where possible, and many costly manholes are eliminated or replaced with less-expensive cleanouts.&#13;
&#13;
Design:        The design concept takes advantage of having septic tank or          Operating         1.   The sewage solids are intercepted by the interceptor box&#13;
               aqua privy or imhoff tanks in individual households or communal      Principles:            or baffled box, septic tank, aqua privy or Imhoff tank. The&#13;
               toilets. For new houses or communities, or houses without septic                            absence of settleable solids negates clogs or blockages in the&#13;
               tank, aqua privy or Imhoff tank, a solids interceptor box/tank                              sewer line despite the smaller diameter and flatter slope.&#13;
               should be added between the house and sewer line/laterals,                             2.   Variation occurs in the rolling terrain where there is a need for&#13;
               which captures and stores incoming solids, attenuates the flow,                             pumping. Generally, only one or two pump/lift stations are&#13;
               and allows the settled sewage to flow out by gravity. The absence                           required in a simplified sewer system.&#13;

Description:      The septic tank is an underground water tight chamber that receives both excreta and flush water from toilets with or without other household&#13;
                  wastewaters (or sullage). The tank serves three purposes: as a sedimentation tank for the removal of incoming solids, while allowing the liquid fraction&#13;
                  (or settled effluent) to pass; as a biochemical reactor for the anaerobic decomposition of the retained solids; and as a storage tank in which the non-&#13;
                  degradable residual solids accumulate. Scum, such as fats and greases, rises to the top. The clarified liquid flows through the outlet pipe and is usually&#13;
                  disposed through a subsurface soil absorption system. The effluent should not be discharged to surface drains, creeks, streams or lakes, without treatment.&#13;

Description:   Imhoff tanks are used by small communities with raw wastewater flows on the order of 950 m3/day (population about 8,000 people or 1,300 households).&#13;
               The Imhoff tank consists of a top compartment, which serves as a settling basin, and a lower compartment in which the settled solids are anaerobically&#13;
               stabilized. Scum and gas vent chambers are located at the sides of the tank. It can be an open or covered tank.&#13;
&#13;
Design:        Imhoff tanks are normally designed to retain wastes for 2 to 4          Operating        Settling of solids occurs in the upper compartment. Sludge falls&#13;
               hours; length equals 3 times its width with depth of 7.2 to 9 m,        Principles:      through the slot to the bottom of the settling compartment into&#13;

Description:   Anaerobic baffled reactor is actually a septic tank in series where wastewater is forced to flow down through the existence of down-shaft or down-pipe&#13;
               and distributed over the entire area of the floor where it inoculates with active sludge for digestion. The up-flow also causes sludge particles to settle.&#13;
&#13;
Design:        Anaerobic treatment is preferred if BOD &gt; 2,000 mg/l. Temperature             Operating      Settler or septic tank must be installed to avoid scum and solid&#13;
               should be 29º -38ºC with pH=6.5-7.5. Not compatible with sulfur               Principles:    particles to enter the baffled section. Inoculation or seeding&#13;

Description:   Engineered Reed Beds are natural treatment systems, which are widely used for the removal of pollutants from domestic and industrial wastewater and&#13;
               sludge. These systems consist of a bottom-lined bed or channel filled with sand or appropriate soil media. Reeds are allowed to grow at the bed. Flow&#13;
               direction in the filter bed may be horizontal or vertical. The treatment mechanisms are biological conversion, physical filtration and chemical absorption.&#13;
               The mechanisms of BOD removal are aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic. Continues flow often results in saturated filter bodies and mainly anaerobic millieu. In&#13;
               the Philippines, engineered reed beds are mostly for treatment of industrial wastewater and is not yet common for domestic wastewater treatment. Effuent&#13;

Description:   The discharge of treated wastewater or wet weather flow from combined sewers into rivers is an acceptable way of disposal if special conditions are met.&#13;
               Usually, water is directly discharged into river through pipes. For discharge, it is necessary to ensure that the self-purification capacity of receiving streams&#13;
               is not toppled or adversely affected. Moreover, it is necessary not to endanger health of residents who live down stream on the riversides. It should be&#13;
               guaranteed that they can still use river water in the usual way (e.g. hygiene, nutrition). The discharge of untreated wastewater into rivers can only be&#13;
               accepted under certain conditions and should only be seen as a temporary solution.&#13;

            Philippines - Sanitation sourcebook and
            decision aid
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This sourcebook presents basic concepts
            on sanitation to help project planners, enterprise managers,
            local executives, and other members of the community assess
            their situation and make a judgment on appropriate
            sanitation interventions. This sourcebook is focused on
            information about low-cost sanitation technology options.
            Technology is not the only important aspect of a sanitation
            project. By focusing on this, the sourcebook does not intend
            to downplay the role of hygiene and behavior change, nor the
            need for institutional frameworks that support sustainable
            financing, operation, and management within sanitation
            projects. The narrow focus of the sourcebook only seeks to
            fill a gap considering that there are excellent toolkits and
            guidebooks already available on broader topics of strategic
            sanitation and hygiene planning, programming, and promotion.
            The objective of this sourcebook is to identify and discuss
            the factors that need to be considered when deciding on
            options for sanitation and wastewater technology. The
            sourcebook aims to present a range of solutions and help
            decision-makers assess the various options based on informed
            choice. A secondary objective of the sourcebook is expected
            to stimulate informed demand for sanitation.
