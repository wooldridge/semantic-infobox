Abstract&#13;
Since the introduction of the stabilization program in Turkey in&#13;
January 1980, export growth has occupied a crucial role in Turkey's&#13;
development strategy. This represented a major departure from the hitherto&#13;
followed inward-looking strategy of import substitution. In the changed&#13;
environment the success on the export front became a sine qua non for the&#13;
success of the new policy as a whole. The growth of exports and penetration&#13;
of foreign markets captured popular attention to a much greater degree than in&#13;
the past. The Government, which centralized the administration of export&#13;
incentives and increased their importance, gave strong indications that it&#13;
would follow through with this policy. Turkish exports responded strongly:&#13;
in the period 1980-84 they increased from $2.9 billion to $7.1 billion;&#13;
manufactured exports - particularly encouraged by the Government - increased&#13;
even faster, doubling their share in total Turkish exports from 36 percent (in&#13;
1980) to 72 percent (in 1984). This remarkable growth was, moreover,&#13;
accomplished in conditions of stagnant or declining world trade.&#13;
Increased export incentives were instrumental in stimulating export&#13;
growth. These incentives included continuous depreciation of the exchange&#13;
rate, often in excess of the inflation differential between Turkey and its&#13;
major trading partners, payment of export tax rebates (to compensate for&#13;
indirect taxes), access to subsidized export credits, and duty-free imports of&#13;
necessary inputs for exporters. Explicit policy of export encouragement,&#13;
maintained by the Government throughout the period under study, produced both&#13;
a change in the mentality of industrialists, many of whom for the first time&#13;
seriously looked to the foreign markets as possible outlets for their output,&#13;
and rendered exports - in conditions of depressed domestic demand - more&#13;
profitable.&#13;
The direct export subsidies (i.e., excluding exchange rate&#13;
depreciation) were so calibrated as to differentiate between industries. They&#13;
have consistently favored capital goods industries, and were the lowest in&#13;
consumer goods industries. Often such a differential treatment of industries&#13;
has been successful in prompting those with a potential to export - and&#13;
possibly a long-run comparative advantage - to enter foreign markets. But&#13;
there were also cases where high levels of incentives yielded only meager&#13;
results. The efficiency of the export incentive policy - measured by its&#13;
departure from the "optimal" structure - did not show significant improvement&#13;
in the period 1980-84. Yet although particular aspects of that policy could&#13;
have been improved, its overall drift both in terms of direct export&#13;
incentives and, in particular, exchange rate adjustment was correct. This is&#13;
borne out by the remarkable growth of exports which took place in this period,&#13;
but even more so by the structural changes it wrought in the economy, such&#13;
that the return to an earlier inward-looking strategy seems, at present,&#13;
difficult to imagine.&#13;

I. Introduction&#13;
The January 1980 Stabilization program represents a major turning&#13;
point in Turkey's economic history. Throughout the 1970's, the country&#13;
followed a policy of import substitution, which resulted in 1977-78 in foreign&#13;
exchange crisis and debt-rescheduling. Although Turkey succeeded to&#13;
reschedule between 1978 and 1980 $9.2 billion of its debt (representing about&#13;
60 percent of the total outstanding and disbursed debt at the end of 1978) the&#13;
foreign exchange crisis persisted. Many essential imported inputs became&#13;
unavailable, and constraints on the import side resulted in a decline in&#13;
Turkey's GNP in 1979 (-0.4 percent). This was for the first time since 1954&#13;
that Turkey's GNP decreased; in per capita terms GNP fell by about&#13;
2.5 percent, which to a generation used to a steadily rising standard of&#13;
living, represented a major shock. Political instability compounded-or&#13;
probably contributed to-the economic slowdown. It is against the backdrop of&#13;
such developments that the then new minority Justice Party Government, which&#13;
took office at the end of 1979, with Mr. Suleyman Demirel as the Prime&#13;
Minister, decided to announce a new economic program. The general philosophy&#13;
of the program can be characterized as liberal on the domestic side, and&#13;
outward-oriented in foreign trade. In order to combat inflation (which at the&#13;
time was running at 80 percent) the program envisaged reduction of the public&#13;
sector deficit (by cutting current expenditures, and allowing State Economic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Enterprises to fix their own prices, thus reducing the need for government&#13;
subsidies), and tighter control of monetary aggregates. The program also&#13;
argued in favor of total lifting of price controls in the private sector. It&#13;
thus undercut spreading shortages and black market dealings. In the foreign&#13;
sector the program enunciated two principles which were to guide Turkey's&#13;
export policy in the years to come: setting of a realistic rate of exchange,&#13;
and the removal of the anti-export bias.&#13;
These general principles were simultaneously translated in a set of&#13;
measures. The policy changes, with respect to exports, were the following:&#13;
-   Turkish lira was devalued by almost 50 percent against the&#13;
dollar. The exchange rate for general exports increased from&#13;
TL 47.10 to TL 70 for a dollar. The multiple rates system which&#13;
existed - with five rates, ranging from TL 35 for agricultural&#13;
export to TL 48 for tourist expenditures - was eliminated except&#13;
for imports of fertilizer, fertilizer inputs, and agricultural&#13;
plant protection chemicals (their rate was raised from TL 35.7 to&#13;
TL 56 for a dollar).&#13;
-   A set of export encouragement measures was introduced.&#13;
Administratively, all authority for promotion of exports was&#13;
vested in "Directorate of Incentives and Implementation" (TUD,&#13;
Tesvik ve Uygulama Dairesi) within the State Planning&#13;
Organization. Duty-free imports of inputs for export production&#13;
were to be facilitated, and export credit (at the rate below the&#13;
market) to be made more easily available. Foreign exchange&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
retention scheme, under which exporters could keep 50 percent of&#13;
their net export earnings, and the export tax rebates, which&#13;
compensated for indirect taxes, were to be expanded.&#13;
The export performance of Turkey between 1980 and 1984 can, without&#13;
exaggeration, be termed spectacular. The value of exports expanded from&#13;
$2.9 billion in 1980 to $7.1 billion in 1984 (at an average rate of 25 percent&#13;
per annum). In volume terms growth averaged 34 percent per annum.&#13;
Concurrently with the overall expansion of exports, the structure of exports&#13;
underwent a major change, both in terms of its product composition, and&#13;
country destination. As Table 1.1 illustrates industrial exports, which in&#13;
1980 represented 36 percent of total Turkish exports, have by 1984 doubled&#13;
their share. Their growth averaged almost 50 percent per annum in dollar&#13;
terms, and was continuous throughout the period. In the same time, exports of&#13;
agriculture and livestock remained almost stagnant in value, and their share&#13;
in total exports decreased from 57 to 25 percent. In terms of&#13;
country-destination of exports, there was a shift toward Middle Eastern&#13;
countries: exports to that region increased by almost 54 percent per annum on&#13;
the average, and their share in Turkey's total exports passed from 17 percent&#13;
in 1980 to around 40 percent in 1981-84 period. The most dramatic increase&#13;
took place in 1981 when exports to the Middle East almost quadrupled. In the&#13;
last two years, however, the growth of these markets seems to have somewhat&#13;
tapered off and the share of exports to Middle Eastern countries in total&#13;
decreased. The structural shift toward the Middle East occured slightly at&#13;
the expense of the share of EEC countries (whose share, however, seems to be&#13;
rising toward its historical level in the last two years), and more&#13;
significantly, of the East European countries. The share of the latter in&#13;

'Turkey's exports dropped from 17 percent in 1980 to only 4 percent in 1984.&#13;
It is interesting to note that in the beginning of the period under study,&#13;
exports to East European countries were no less important than exports to the&#13;
Middle East; by 1984, however, exports to the Middle East were almost ten&#13;
times greater.&#13;

II. Administrative Organization and Incentives Policy&#13;
As mentioned above, the January 1980 measures centralized&#13;
administration of heretofore dispersed incentives policies into TUD within the&#13;
State Planning Organization. (In January 1984 the name of TUD was changed&#13;
into Tesvik ve Uygulama Baskanligi, TUB. In this text all references will be&#13;
to TUB.) This measure has helped both the transparency, and the&#13;
implementation and monitoring of the incentives policy. The only area of&#13;
incentives about which the data are not collected in TUB relates to tax&#13;
rebates for exporters which are paid by the Central Bank, although the right&#13;
to tax rebates is conferred by the certificate issued by the TUB.&#13;
Granting of any incentives is linked with the issuance of the export&#13;
incentive certificate ('Ihracat Tesvik Belgesi'). Exporters apply to the TUB&#13;
for the certificate, and on the basis of it receive preferential credit,&#13;
foreign exchange allocation (for imported inputs) and export tax rebates. For&#13;
preferential credit the certificate is presented to the commercial bank which,&#13;
after extending the credit, discounts all or part of it at the Central Bank.&#13;
Similarly, for foreign exchange allocations, the certificate gives the&#13;
exporter the right to purchase foreign exchange from the commercial bank,&#13;
which is later repaid by the Central Bank, as well as the right to import&#13;
duty-free inputs up to the amount of purchased foreign exchange. The former&#13;
aspect has gradually, with the liberalization of the foreign exchange&#13;
transactions and the near absence of the overvaluation of the TL, become of&#13;
much less consequence.l/ The duty-free aspect, however, remains&#13;
important. Finally, export tax rebates are paid back to the exporter after&#13;
1/   Obviously, firms can also finance imports by their own foreign&#13;
exchange holdings (obtained through export retention rights, or&#13;
otherwise).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
the completion of exports. The certificate, in addition to fixing the amount&#13;
of credit, foreign exchange allocation, and tax rebates, also details the&#13;
export commitment on whose realization the granting of the incentives depends.&#13;
The system of incentives as it evolved since 1980 thus contains the&#13;
following direct incentive schemes for export-oriented production.&#13;
(1)   Export tax rebates which are supposed to reimburse exporters for&#13;
the indirect taxes. They are almost entirely (95-97 percent of&#13;
total rebates paid out) geared toward exporters of manufactured&#13;
products.&#13;
(2)   Export credits at the rate lower than the one charged on similar&#13;
projects whose output is not directed for exports. Export&#13;
credits are. of four different kinds: general export credits,&#13;
export credits for packaging and delivery, credits for exports of&#13;
fresh fruits and vegetables, and credits for Foreign Trade&#13;
Corporations (i.e. large trading houses).l/ The latter two are&#13;
paid out of a special Export Encouragement Fund. Export credits&#13;
to Foreign Trade Corporations are thus for the purpose of&#13;
monitoring separated from the general export credit. More than&#13;
90 percent of total export credits allocated through TUB's&#13;
encouragement certificates were for manufactured exports.&#13;
(3)   Foreign exchange allocations which confer right to duty-free&#13;
imports of inputs used in production for exports are of two&#13;
sorts: general foreign exchange allocation, and allocations for&#13;
1/ Up to 1984 Foreign Trade Corporations were called Export capital companies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
temporary imports (i.e. for inputs which will be directly built&#13;
into exports, like, for instance packaging materials). Almost&#13;
all of allocated foreign exchange is for manufacturing&#13;
industries. l/&#13;
The purpose of the paper is to review each of these incentives,&#13;
quantify the importance of each scheme for manufacturing exports, assess their&#13;
individual and combined subsidy element, and finally, come to a conclusion&#13;
about the influence and significance of the incentive schemes for expansion of&#13;
Turkish manufactured exports in the period 1980-84. This period represents a&#13;
self-contained whole. This is so because its beginning coincides, as&#13;
mentioned above, with the launching of the stabilization drive, while its end&#13;
marks also the ending of strong direct incentive policies. In effect, the&#13;
system of export incentives was by the early 1985 quite different from the one&#13;
that existed only one year ago. Export tax rebates were lowered, and plans&#13;
for their gradual phasing out were being implemented; preferential export&#13;
credits were abolished, and in February 1985 Turkey signed GATT Subsidy and&#13;
1/   Foreign exchange allocation for export-related investments is not&#13;
considered here. Also, there are direct tax rebates for exporters.&#13;
Exporters can deduct 20 percent of export value from their taxable&#13;
income (assessed at the corporate rate of 40 percent). Total taxes&#13;
paid are thus reduced by 8 percent of value of exports (provided, of&#13;
course, the taxable income is still positive after the deduction).&#13;
For non-incorporated exporters, whose taxable income is assessed at&#13;
the rate of 15 percent, the value of the rebate is equal to 3 percent&#13;
of exports. In our calculations this incentive has not been included&#13;
because the data on direct tax rebates are not available. Taxable&#13;
income of enterprises is assessed at the provincial level, when the&#13;
allowance for exports is also made. No centralized data on the&#13;
amount of taxes thus saved, exist for Turkey. Furthermore, it is&#13;
obvious that the actual amount of taxes saved will vary both in&#13;
function of the overall profitability of enterprises, and&#13;
distribution of profitability (i.e. if most profitable enterprises&#13;
earn the bulk of their income from domestic sales, the value of the&#13;
incentive will be less), and are not thus as easily controlled by the&#13;
Government as the other incentives schemes whose impact is more&#13;
immediate and better known.&#13;

Cornpensations Tax Code which prohibits direct government export subsidies on&#13;
goods exported to the countries-signatories of the agreement. The system has&#13;
thus already moved away to some extent from direct encouragement of exports&#13;
and is likely to do so even more in future.l/ The five year period during&#13;
which it existed in an almost unchanged form represents a sufficient period to&#13;
study how, in conjunction with the devaluation of the Turkish lira, the system&#13;
has contributed to the unprecedented growth of Turkish exports.&#13;
The study is organized as follows. Sections III to VI (on tax&#13;
rebates, export credits, duty-free imports and exchange rate policy) survey&#13;
the export incentives granted to the manufacturing industries and present an&#13;
estimate of their relative importance -in terms of the subsidy component they&#13;
contain- for the period 1980-1984. Section VII brings these results together&#13;
by estimating the total combined export subsidy, and its structure by&#13;
particular industries, and groups of industries (consumer, intermediate, and&#13;
capital goods). It also evaluates whether the level of incentive granted to&#13;
different industries was consistent with Turkey's comparative advantage.&#13;
Section VIII presents an estimate of the real export exchange rate (which&#13;
accounts for all direct export incentives and the real exchange rate) and&#13;
considers its relationship with the volume of manufactured exports. Section&#13;
IX studies, on the basis of interviews conducted with exporters, their&#13;
perception of the importance of different incentives. Finally, Section X&#13;
presents an overall assessment of the role played by direct export incentives&#13;
in stimulating growth of Turkish exports.&#13;
1/ In January 1985 a different type of direct incentive was introduced:&#13;
exporters were paid a 4 percent cash grant on value of their exports.&#13;

III. Export Tax Rebates&#13;
(a) Development of the scheme. Refund of indirect taxes paid on exported&#13;
output has traditionally been one of main export incentives. Originally, tax&#13;
rebates were paid individually for each exported product. In 1975, the system&#13;
was simplified by consolidating all export on ten lists, each with its&#13;
specific tax rebate rate. A special incentive was introduced for large&#13;
exporters (defined at the time as those with annual exports in excess of&#13;
$1.8 million) in form of additional tax rebates of five percentage points.&#13;
After the June 1979 devaluation, the basic rebate rates were lowered, while&#13;
the minimum for the application of the special rebate for large exporters was&#13;
raised to $3.5 million.-1 The basic rebate rates ranged between 15 percent&#13;
(on List 1) to 0 (on List 9) with specific rebates on List 10 items (packaging&#13;
products). In May 1981 - simultaneously with the introduction of the floating&#13;
exchange rate - tax rebates were raised, and all products eligible for export&#13;
tax rebates arranged onto ten lists with rates varying between 20 (on List 1)&#13;
and 0 percent (on List 9). The rates between the lists declined by&#13;
2.5 percentage points (e.g. List 1=20 percent, List 2=17.5 percent, List&#13;
3=15 percent, etc. with the exception of List 8 on which tax rebates are&#13;
5 percent as on List 7). List 10, as in the past, included specific export&#13;
tax rebates (for example, tax rebates in absolute amounts). The decision on&#13;
what list the product will be placed was, and is, based on the estimated&#13;
amount of indirect taxes paid in the final and intermediate stages of&#13;
production. However, in addition to that, several other criteria (e.g. the&#13;
proportion of the domestic value added, products whose exported should be&#13;
encouraged, etc.) are taken into account, with the result that the tax rebate&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
the product receives may only loosely be related to the actual amount of&#13;
indirect taxes paid. The difference thus represent subsidy to exporters.-/&#13;
The decision about the shifts of the products between the lists presently lies&#13;
with the TUB, and the Treasury and Foreign Trade Undersecretariat. Both&#13;
bodies are under the Deputy Prime Minister. Prior to December 1983, however,&#13;
a more formal government decree was required to effect a change from one to&#13;
another list.&#13;
In addition to the basic ten lists of tax rebates there are&#13;
additional tax rebates given to large exporters. For all exports between&#13;
$2 and $10 million, the exporter receives an additional marginal rebate of&#13;
6 percent; similarly, for all exports between $10 and $30 million, the&#13;
additional marginal rebate is 12 percent. Thus, for example, if a firm&#13;
exports $25 million worth of goods, it would be eligible for an average&#13;
additional tax rebate of 9.12 percent.-/   If the value of exports exceeds&#13;
$30 million, the additional tax rebate is 10 percent on the whole amount.&#13;
Figure III.1 depicts the progressity of the additional tax rebates.&#13;
At the end of 1983 Turkish government took the decision to gradually&#13;
scale down export tax rebates. The decision, taken by the new government of&#13;
Mr. Turgut Ozal, was motivated by several factors. First, it was thought&#13;
that, in accordance with the policy of trade liberalization, an ever greater&#13;
1/       Also, to the extent that domestic producers cannot shift the whole of&#13;
indirect taxes onto the final consumer, the subsidy to exporters&#13;
(versus producers for the domestic market) is even greater.&#13;
2/       For the first two million of exports there is no additional tax&#13;
rebate; for the next eight million, the additional tax rebate is&#13;
$0.48 million, and for the further $15 million it is equal&#13;
$1.8 million. This yields $2.28 million in total additional tax&#13;
rebates or 9.12 percent of the value of exports.&#13;

emphasis should be placed on indirect tools for encouragement of exports (i.e.&#13;
the exchange rate) and less on direct subsidies to exporters. Second,&#13;
relatively high levels of tax rebates were responsible for emergence of the&#13;
so-called fictitious exports. In effect, one part of what purported to be&#13;
Turkish exports was actually never realized. Foreign exchange was transferred&#13;
from the country of destination of exports (often by Turkish workers there,&#13;
friends or business partners of the presumed Turkish exporter), while the&#13;
actual transfer of goods never took place. The transfer of foreign currency&#13;
entitled, however, the exporter to claim tax rebates. In such a way, he was&#13;
eventually able to sell foreign currency at the premium (equal to the rate of&#13;
tax rebate) which, in view of near absence of TL overvaluation since 1981, was&#13;
fairly substantial./ The amount of fictitious exports was estimated at 5&#13;
to 10 percent of total Turkey's exports with a tendency to increase.-/&#13;
Almost all fictitious exports relate to exports to West Germany and&#13;
Switzerland, both with sizable Turkish guest-worker population.-/    The third&#13;
reason for the reduction of tax rebates lay in the domain of public finance,&#13;
i.e. in the need to cut expenditures.&#13;
The phased reduction of tax rebates took place as scheduled. On&#13;
April 1, 1984 all rebates were lowered by 20 percent: for example, a product&#13;
1/ The premium could then be split between the presumed exporter and its&#13;
partner abroad.&#13;
2/  In 1984, the value of fictitious exports was estimated at about $1 billion&#13;
which was 14 percent of total exports.&#13;
3/  It should be mentioned, however, that from the balance of payments view&#13;
ficticious exports are not subject for concern, and they may even result&#13;
in greater inflow of foreign currency in Turkey. They simply represent&#13;
the shift from workers' remittances into exports. But if all the money&#13;
transferred via fictitious exports would not have otherwise come into&#13;
Turkey, fictitious exports actually raise the amount of inflow.&#13;

which received a 20 percent tax rebate was to receive henceforth only&#13;
16 percent. Then on September 1, 1984, a further reduction of 25 percent of&#13;
the original amount took place (with the product in our example receiving only&#13;
11 percent as tax rebate). In less than one year, rates have thus been almost&#13;
halved. The same pattern of gradual reduction was also applied to additional&#13;
rebates for large exporters.-Y&#13;
(b) Distribution of the Tax Rebates. Table III.1 depicts the industry-wise&#13;
distribution of the export tax rebates as of January 1985.-/ It shows the&#13;
number of products belonging to a specific industry which receive a given&#13;
export tax rebate, as well as the average rebate rate.&#13;
1/ The scale of the graph in Figure III.1 needs accordingly to be changed,&#13;
although its progressivity and the relative additional incentive are large&#13;
exporters, are the same.&#13;

Figure III.2 shows the how the distribution of the itemSeligible for&#13;
tax rebates has changed in the period 1981-1985. There was an increase in&#13;
proportion of items receiving moderately high rebates (items on lists 3 and&#13;
4), and a decrease in proportion of items on lists 1 (high rebates) and 5&#13;
(relatively low rebates). The structure has thus remained firmly stable.&#13;
Table II1.2 shows the evolution of the overall number of items&#13;
eligible for tax rebates, and the average tax rebate. (The average tax rebate&#13;
is calculated by multiplying the number of items on a given list with the tax&#13;
rebate rate applicable to that list. We call this average-by-list tax&#13;
rebate. It differs from the average actual tax rebate which is the ratio of&#13;
tax rebates effectively paid out and value of eligible exports). We can see&#13;
that the number of items eligible for tax rebates has steadily increased from&#13;
1980. While the scheme originally covered 373 items, it now extends over 648&#13;
items. The enlargement of the scheme has been continuous, and it embraced all&#13;
sectors, with the single exception of consumer goods whose number slightly&#13;
declined in 1985. The expansion has been most important for capital goods&#13;
items whose number more than doubled in five years passing from 103 to 254.&#13;

items have been placed on high tax rebate lists. The opposite is true for&#13;
consumer and intermediate goods. The overall average-by-list tax rebate&#13;
remained reasonably steady - at around 13.5 percent - until early 1984 when&#13;
tax rebate rates, as explained above, began to be scaled down. The stability&#13;
of the rates means that the new items which were regularly added to the lists&#13;
were not disproportionally directed toward the high- or low-rebate lists. In&#13;
January 1985, by which date basic rates of tax rebates were scaled down by&#13;
45 percent comparatively to early 1984, the average-by-list rate was only&#13;
7.8 percent, i.e. significantly below the level of one year ago (13.55 in&#13;
December 1983). It may be noted, however, that the structure of items on the&#13;
lists shifted slightly toward high-rate lists: in effect, if the distribution&#13;
of the eligible items in January 1985 had been the same as in December 1983, a&#13;
45 percent across the board reduction of the rates would have lowered the&#13;
average-by-list rebate to 7.45 percent, instead of the actual 7.79 percent.&#13;
In terms of individual industries, proportionally more items were&#13;
placed on high rebate lists in subsectors like iron and steel, transportation&#13;
equipment, leather and fur, and both electrical and non-electrical machinery&#13;
(see Table III.1). At the other end of the spectrum, chemicals and textiles&#13;
have more than the average number of items belonging to low-rebate lists.&#13;
This, indeed, does not necessarily mean that these subsectors were actually&#13;
receiving higher (lower) tax rebates, as we abstract here from the relative&#13;
importance (export value) of each product. To this issue we turn next.&#13;
(c) Subsidy component of tax rebates. Table III.3 shows the relationship&#13;
between total exports of an industry, its eligible exports (i.e. exports of&#13;
products eligible for the tax rebates), and actual amounts of tax rebates paid&#13;
in the period 1980-1984.&#13;

The average tax rebate rate (proportion of taxes refunded against the&#13;
eligible exports) for the manufacturing as a whole increased successively from&#13;
around 9 percent in 1980 to 14 percent in 1981 and to 21 percent and 23&#13;
percent in 1982 and 1983 respectively. In 1984 it declined to 21 percent.&#13;
The increase between 1980 and 1983 was not due to a changing composition of&#13;
exports but to a general increase in tax rebate in all the industries. In&#13;
effect, tax rebates rates increased between 1980 and 1981 and between 1981 and&#13;
1982 in all industries, by an average of 5 to 6 percentage points annually,&#13;
and in some industries (leather and fur, papers, iron and steel) increases&#13;
exceeded 8 percentage points p.a. In 1983 the rises, albeit much slower,&#13;
continued in ten out of fourteen industries. Finally, in 1984 the trend&#13;
reversed and tax rebate rates increased in only two industries, and declined&#13;
in the other twelve.&#13;
Coincidently with increasing tax rebate rates, the coverage of the&#13;
tax rebate scheme (measured by the share of eligible exports in total exports)&#13;
expanded from less than two-thirds in 1980 and 1981 about 80 percent in 1982&#13;
and 1983, and then to about 87 percent in 1984. Thus, in 1984, increase in&#13;
the coverage has to a large extent mitigated the decrease in the average tax&#13;
rebate rate and left the subsidy component of the scheme almost unchanged.&#13;
Average tax rebates and coverage display a distinct pattern in terms&#13;
of large groupings of industries. As Table III.4 shows, the average tax&#13;
rebate in capital goods industries was until 1984 consistently higher than in&#13;
consumer and intermediate goods. The differential, however, has narrowed&#13;
since 1982 as the average tax rebate for intermediate and consumer goods&#13;
increased sharply. In 1984, general reduction of tax rebates affected capital&#13;
industries the most, and in a marked reversal from the past, they fell to the&#13;
third place. General tendency of rising tax rebates - up to 1984 - clearly&#13;
emerges from these data. In each year in the period 1980-83 the average tax&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
rebate for all three categories increased. Particularly noteworthy was the&#13;
rise in intermediate goods industries, from b.6 percent in 1980 to about 23&#13;
percent in 1983 (the level at which it all but remained in 1984).&#13;

NOTE: Consumer goods industries include food and beverages and textiles.&#13;
Intermediate goods industries are leather and fur, paper and paper&#13;
products, chemicals, rubber and plastic, glass, cement, iron and steel,&#13;
and non-ferrous metals.&#13;
Capital goods industries are fabricated metal products, non-electrical&#13;
machinery, electrical machinery, and transportation equipment.&#13;
This classification is used throughout the text.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
The comprehensiveness of the export tax rebate scheme was also&#13;
greater for the capital goods industries than for the other two categories.&#13;
Again, the coverage of the intermediate goods sector by the scheme expanded&#13;
the most rapidly (from less than one-half of total exports in 1980 to&#13;
86 percent in 1984). The explanation for more than 100% coverage of capital&#13;
goods sector lies in the different exchange rates used for actual exports&#13;
(exchange rate at the time of exports), and the eligible exports (exchange&#13;
rate at the later date when the tax rebates are refunded).l/&#13;
Industries with consistently high tax rebate rates included&#13;
transportation equipment (with an average rate of 24 percent over five years),&#13;
iron and steel (20 percent) and leather and fur products (19 percent).&#13;
Textiles and metal products also enjoyed relatively high tax rebates (18&#13;
percent in the 1980-84 period). The industry with the lowest tax rebate was&#13;
chemicals (less than 14 percent on the average).&#13;
The subsidy element conferred by the export tax rebate scheme depends&#13;
on (1) the share of the eligible in total exports, (2) the average tax rebate&#13;
rate, and (3) the actual indirect taxes paid for which the scheme is supposed&#13;
to compensate. Obviously, the higher the share of indirect taxes in total&#13;
value of exports, the less would be, ceteris paribus, the incentive value of&#13;
the export tax rebate scheme. As data on actual proportion of taxes in value&#13;
1/       Eligible exports in TLs, and the amount of tax rebates to be paid are&#13;
calculated at that--higher--rate.&#13;

of exports for different industries are not available, we shall assume that in&#13;
1980 when the importance of the scheme was at its low point, tax rebates were&#13;
merely sufficient to compensate for the actual incurred indirect taxes.l/&#13;
The subsidy component of the scheme is then derived as the difference between&#13;
the tax rebate rates in years 1981-1984 and the tax rebate rate in 1980,&#13;
multiplied by the share of the eligible in total exports. Table III.5 shows&#13;
the estimated subsidy component of the export tax rebate scheme for the 14&#13;
industries, as well as for the groupings of consumer, intermediate, and&#13;
capital goods industries.&#13;

The incentive value of the export tax rebates has substantially&#13;
'increased in the period 1981-1984: while in 1981 the value of the implicit&#13;
subsidy in the scheme was equal to 3.6 percent of the value of total&#13;
manufactured exports, it jumped to more than 10 percent in 1982, and then&#13;
increased further to 11 percent in 1983 and 1984. The increase in the subsidy&#13;
was across the board. In the consumer goods industries the subsidy element&#13;
rose from a low 2.3 percent in 1981 to almost 10 percent in 1983 and 1984; in&#13;
intermediate industries it went up from 5.3 percent to 13 percent, and in&#13;
capital goods, in the same time, from 5 percent to 15 percent before falling&#13;
to less than 10 percent in 1984. It is obvious from these results that the&#13;
scaling down of export tax rebate rates in 1984 had less impact on the value&#13;
of the overall subsidy than could have been thought solely from the announced&#13;
reductions. This was due to a number of reasons: structure of exports&#13;
shifted toward high rebate industries, the bunching of exports before the date&#13;
when the tax rebate rates were to be lowered, and the increased coverage of&#13;
the scheme. We can see from Table III.6 that if all of the elements had&#13;
remained the same as in 1983, the subsidy value of the scheme would have been&#13;
lowered by about 43 percent (from 10.5 percent of value of exports in 1983 to&#13;
6.6 percent). The change in the structure of exports (both within sectors,&#13;
and between the sectors) toward the high tax rebate products is responsible&#13;
for increasing the average subsidy rate by 3.84 percentage points;l/ greater&#13;
coverage of the scheme and bunching of exports account for respectively 0.27&#13;
and 0.36 percentage points increase in the subsidy rate. All these effects&#13;
have thus combined to make the reduction in the incentive component of the&#13;
scheme much less than was anticipated in early 1984.&#13;

The individual industries which enjoyed the highest tax rebate&#13;
subsidies were fabricated metal products (about 42 percent of the value of&#13;
exports on the average in the 1980-84 period), cement (12 percent), and&#13;
leather and fur products (11 percent). The industries where the subsidy&#13;
elemaent was small include food processing and transportation equipment (about&#13;
4 percent).&#13;

IV. Export Credits&#13;
(a) Export credit and general short-term credit. The incentive value of&#13;
export credits resides in the difference between the rate of interest charged&#13;
on general short-term (ST) credits and a (lower) rate of interest on export&#13;
credits. Figure IV.1 shows the rates for the period January 1980 - January&#13;
1985. As can be observed, the differential which at the beginning of 1980 was&#13;
17 percent increased to about 30 percent in 1981; since then it has&#13;
consistently declined. The average differential between the general and the&#13;
export credit was 20.3 percent in 1982, 18.9 percent in 1983 and 17.0 percent&#13;
in 1984. Finally in January 1985 the government decided to eliminate&#13;
subsidized export credit. The decreasing differential between the two rates&#13;
since 1981 is essentially the reflection of a fast increase in the rate of&#13;
interest changed on export credits. Thus, for example, in January 1980, at&#13;
the inception of the stabilization program, the effective rate of interest on&#13;
export credits-I was estimated at 8.25 percent, while inflation was running&#13;
at more than 100 percent p.a. However, by the end of 1984 - i.e. before the&#13;
subsidized credit was entirely eliminated - the effective rate of interest&#13;
reached 50.5 percent, not much below the ruling rate of inflation&#13;
1/   The effective rate adjusts the rate charged by the commercial banks&#13;
for all government's contributions (subsidies) passed over to the&#13;
borrower. It does not, however, take into account counterbalancing&#13;
funds which many borrowers were required to deposit in order to get a&#13;
credit. Counterbalancing funds existed both for general and export&#13;
credit and, hence, the calculated differential between the two&#13;
effective rates is probably not much influenced by their omission.&#13;
Rates of interest paid on counterbalancing funds by the commercial&#13;
banks were low. Amount of the funds - as the proportion of the&#13;
credit - is difficult to gauge, both because the operation is illegal&#13;
and also because the proportion varied (significantly) as the&#13;
function of the borrower and the commercial bank involved in the&#13;
operation. However, estimates put these funds at 20 to 40 percent of&#13;
the credit amount.&#13;

(56 percent p.a.). Figure IV.2 shows the relationship between the effective&#13;
rate of interest on export credits and the rate of inflation.l/ We see that&#13;
the real rate of interest on export credits shows a continuous improvement&#13;
(increase) from the first quarter of 1980 (when it was -49.0 percent) to the&#13;
last quarter of 1982 (when it reached +4.8 percent). Effectively, in each&#13;
quarter during these three years the differential between inflation rate and&#13;
effective cost of export credit was reduced. There was some retranchment from&#13;
that policy in 1983, as most of the time the real rate of interest on export&#13;
credit hovered around zero percent. Furthermore, in 1984, brisk acceleration&#13;
of inflation failed to be entirely offset by increased nominal rate, thus&#13;
leading to an average negative real rate of interest of approximately&#13;
2 percent per annum (see Table IV.1). After January 1985, however,&#13;
elimination of special export credits increased the level of interest on these&#13;
credits by approximately 15 percentage points, i.e. set them on a par with&#13;
interest rates on general purpose ST credits. The real rate of interest on&#13;
export credits was thus about 10 percentage points above the rate of inflation.&#13;

The difference between the interest rate on general and export credit&#13;
stems from three factors: (i) a higher "scheduled" 1/ (and discount) rate for&#13;
the general credit; 2/ (ii) a positive contribution to the Interest Rate&#13;
Rebate Fund (IRRF) on general credits versus a net subsidy received from the&#13;
Fund on export credit; and (iii) exemption from the transaction tax for the&#13;
export credits.&#13;
Elements (ii) and (iii) represent the most obvious subsidies (lower&#13;
discount rate, reflected in the element (i) is another). General purpose&#13;
credits were charged in the period 1980-end 1983 between 10 and 15 percent of&#13;
the base rate as contribution to the IRRF. On the other hand, tax on export&#13;
credit was (until the end of 1982) 10 percent of the base rate and the subsidy&#13;
- from the IRRF - between 35 and 25 percent. When the tax on export credits&#13;
was eliminated in January 1983, the subsidy was also reduced from 25 to 15&#13;
percent. Thus, throughout the period 1980-end 1983 export credits were&#13;
receiving a net subsidy of about 15 percent from the IRRF vs. a net&#13;
contribution of 10-15 percent to the same fund from general ST credits.&#13;
Similarly, the transaction tax charged on general purpose credits was 25&#13;
percent of the base rate between January 1980 and April 1981; it was then&#13;
reduced to 15 percent, the level at which it remained until the end of 1983.&#13;
1/ The base (or scheduled) rate of interest is determined by the "gentlemen's&#13;
agreement" between the major commercial banks (and is largely influenced&#13;
by the Central Bank's discount rate). It is with reference to this rate&#13;
that different contributions and subsidies are calculated, so that the&#13;
cost to the borrower is equal to the base rate plus (minus) contributions&#13;
(subsidies).&#13;
2/ Quite exceptionally, in the first half of 1980 the base and discount rates&#13;
for export credits were higher than for the general ST credit (e.g.&#13;
between March and June discount rate for export credit was 15, and for the&#13;
general ST credit 14 percent p.a.). The final cost to the borrower for&#13;
the export credit was less because of government's subsidies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
Export credits on the other hand were exempt from the transaction tax&#13;
throughout. The Ozal government, in its general attempt to simplify the&#13;
incentive system, took in December 1983 important measures whereby subsidies&#13;
attributable to factors (ii) and (iii) were sharply reduced. The subsidy from&#13;
IRRF to exporters was eliminated. Simultaneously, net contribution to IRRF&#13;
from general purpose credits was halved: from 15 percent it was reduced to&#13;
7.5 percent. Also the transaction tax was lowered from 15 percent to&#13;
3 percent. The impact of these measures on the interest rate differential&#13;
was, however, somewhat offset by a steeper increase in the base interest rate&#13;
on the short-term general credit than on the export credit. Both the general&#13;
and export credits thus become more expensive (see Figure IV.1), but the&#13;
differential was only slowly reduced in 1984, until in January 1985&#13;
preferential financing of export credits was entirely discontinued.&#13;
Table IV.2 shows outstanding export credits of the Central Bank (CB)&#13;
the and the commercial banks. The share of the Central Bank's export credits&#13;
in Central Bank's total outstanding credits clearly displays an increasing&#13;
trend up to the end of 1983, speedily rising from around 6 percent in most of&#13;
1980 to almost 15 percent in the fourth quarter of 1983. On the average,&#13;
export credits accounted in that period for little over one-tenth of total&#13;
CB's outstanding credits. Starting from the early 1984 there is, however, a&#13;
sharp decline in their importance, so that by the end of the year - i.e.&#13;
shortly before export credits were eliminated in January 1985 - their share&#13;
dropped to less than 6 percent.&#13;
As for the relative shares of the Central bank and commercial banks'&#13;
export credits, the evolution was somewhat different. In effect, throughout&#13;
the whole period export credits extended by the Central Bank have failed to&#13;
keep pace with the volume of export credits extended by the commercial banks,&#13;
and their share in total outstanding export credit has accordingly declined.&#13;

In the beginning of the period under study the Central Bank's export credits&#13;
represented more than 50% of total outstanding export credits; their share&#13;
continuously declined to reach, by the end of 1984, very low 11.6 percent.&#13;
Commercial banks' export credits expanded. The attractiveness of export&#13;
credits for commercial banks (despite lower interest they carried) stemmed&#13;
from several factors.l/ Firstly, commercial banks were receiving direct&#13;
subsidy from the IRRF when extending export credits from own resources. The&#13;
subsidy was so calibrated as to make the return on general purpose and export&#13;
credits almost equal. For example, when the base lending rate for general ST&#13;
credits was 50 percent, and for export credits 40 percent, the rebate paid to&#13;
the commercial bank was 8 percentage points. Secondly, commercial banks could&#13;
hold smaller required reserves on export credits (20%) instead of the normal&#13;
(25%) requirement. Thereby, the banks could earn approximately 1 percentage&#13;
point of additional interest.2/ Thirdly, commercial banks normally expected&#13;
that the exporter would deposit his foreign exchange earnings with the bank&#13;
which financed his exports.   (If he did not, he would have more difficulty&#13;
obtaining export credit next time).3/ The return to the bank on foreign&#13;
exchange was the difference between the selling and buying price of the&#13;
foreign exchange, as well as the commission on the letter of credit (when the&#13;
foreign exchange is sold to importers). These two commissions added 3 to 4&#13;
percentage points to the return to commercial banks. Similarly, in condition&#13;
l/ Commercial banks were obliged, in addition, to allocate 15 percent of&#13;
total credits to export credits for industrial products.&#13;
2/ The rate of interest on required reserves was, obviously, lower than the&#13;
opportunity cost of funds (i.e. rate of interest banks could charge their&#13;
customers).&#13;
3/ About 90 percent of foreign exchange earned through exports financed by a&#13;
large commercial bank was deposited at the same bank.&#13;
&#13;

of real depreciation of TL, foreign exchange conveyed a real gain to the&#13;
holder. Hence, even if the IRRF subsidy to banks fell somewhat short of the&#13;
difference between the lending rates on general short-term and export credit,&#13;
other factors made export credits fairly profitable for commercial banks.&#13;
When the government's effort in financing of exports began to slacken&#13;
(in 1983), commercial banks were able to step in, and keep the level of export&#13;
financing, both as a ratio to actual realized exports and in real terms (see&#13;
Table IV.2) unchanged, or even slightly higher. As data in Table IV.3 show,&#13;
the ratio of total outstanding export credit (both CB's and commercial banks')&#13;
to exports remained at an average level of 170 to 180 percent (outstanding&#13;
export credits as percentage of quarterly exports). Total outstanding export&#13;
credits have gradually risen as percentage of exports until the end of 1983.&#13;
This tendency is clear except for seasonal spurts of exports, toward the end&#13;
of the year, with the resulting decline in the ratio. However, beginning with&#13;
1984 the ratio between outstanding export credits and exports markedly&#13;
declined. Only partly was it the result of a brisk increase in exports in&#13;
1984. The main factor was a rapid withdrawal of CB's export credits, whose&#13;
amount, as shown in Table IV.I, was more than halved in nominal terms in three&#13;
quarters of 1984. This was only imperfectly compensated by the increased&#13;
commercial banks' lending. The outstanding credit/quarterly exports ratio&#13;
dropped to 100 percent (in III/1984), the lowest level in four years.&#13;
In real terms (adjusted for the wholesale price increase) export&#13;
credits rose almost six-fold between the early 1980 and the end of 1983 (the&#13;
average real rate of growth of almost 80 percent p.a.). The most dramatic&#13;
increase took place in 1981 when the December 1981 stock of real outstanding&#13;
export credit exceeded its level one year ago by 2.8 times (see Table IV.3).&#13;
The growth was, as explained above, sustained mostly by expansion of&#13;
commercial banks' credits. Export credits extended by the Central Bank, after&#13;

increasing in real terms throughout 1981 (see Figure IV.3) grew in the&#13;
following two years, at best at the rate commensurate with the rate of&#13;
inflation. From the early 1984, total outstanding export credit (in real&#13;
terms) began to decline. Real growth was thus abruptly reversed in 1984 as&#13;
both CB's and commercial banks' credits steeply declined: commercial banks'&#13;
credits decreased by 30 percent in real terms between December 1983 and&#13;
September 1984 while Central bank's credits fell in the same period by more&#13;
than 70 percent (in real terms).&#13;
(b) Subsidy component of export credits. As in the case of export tax&#13;
rebates, the importance of the subsidy element contained in the export credits&#13;
will be studied for Turkey's manufactured exports. Table IV.4 shows the&#13;
relationship between extended export credit to manufacturing 1/ and&#13;
manufacturing exports as well as the subsidy component of the credit. The&#13;
overall level of the subsidy continuously declined from about 16 percent in&#13;
1980 to 6.5 percent in 1983 and, then to a mere 1.1 percent in 1984. The&#13;
decrease in the subsidy came as both the amount of extended credits&#13;
comparatively to manufactured exports, and the interest rate differential&#13;
between general and export credits, declined. Thus, the ratio between the&#13;
extended export credit to manufacturing, and manufactured exports which, in&#13;
1980 reached almost 70 percent fell to only 12 percent by 1984.2/&#13;
Retranchment of the export credit to manufactured exports paralleled lower&#13;
availability of export credit for all exports. Simultaneously, the interest&#13;
rate subsidization of export credit went down from more than 20 percentage&#13;
/   The previous analysis dealt with the outstanding (and not extended) export&#13;
credit to all exports (and not to manufactured exports only).&#13;
2/ This ratio is different from the one used above, where we compared&#13;
outstanding export credits ( a stock) to exports (a flow). Here, both are&#13;
flows as we have data on gross extended export credits in a period.&#13;

points p.a. in 1980 and 1981 to 17 points in 1984. Beginning with 1984&#13;
another element contributed to a further reduction in the subsidy: maturity&#13;
of export credits was shortened from 1 year to 6 months thus directly cutting&#13;
by half the already dwindling subsidy component. The maturity of export&#13;
credits was reduced in order to maintain a reasonably good availability of&#13;
export financing in conditions of overall scarcity of funds (and stringent&#13;
credit ceilings as part of the IMF stand-by arrangement), and to reduce the&#13;
amount of "leakages", i.e. use of export credits for other purposes.l/&#13;
Finally, as mentioned above, in January 1985, preferential export financing&#13;
was entirely eliminated.&#13;

1/ It was alleged in effect that producers often applied for export credits&#13;
determined to use them for other purposes and essentially uninterested in&#13;
exports, so that when they had to fulfill the export pledge (made in order&#13;
to get the credit) they were ready to accept lower prices just to sell&#13;
goods. This practice was alleged to be partly responsible for decrease of&#13;
Turkish export prices. Turkish Government was thus subsidizing foreign&#13;
buyers.&#13;

The credit financing of export was generally higher in capital than&#13;
in consumer and intermediate goods industries (see Table IV.5). Accordingly,&#13;
the subsidy component of export credits was higher in capital goods&#13;
industries: in 1980 it amounted to almost 37 percent of value of exports, and&#13;
subsequently declined to 22 percent in 1981 and to little over 10 percent in&#13;
1982 and 1983. In 1984 it was sharply reduced to 2.4 percent. The subsidy&#13;
component in exports of intermediate goods went down from 11 percent in 1980&#13;
to only 1 percent in 1984. In consumer goods exports the decline was even&#13;
steeper: from 15.2 percent in 1980 to less than 1 percent in 1984.&#13;

A similar pattern emerges when we study the subsidy component for the&#13;
14 industries (see Table IV.6). Industries with a high subsidy component&#13;
include metal products (about 34 percent over the five years), electrical and&#13;
non-electrical machinery (26 and 15 percent) and non-ferrous metals&#13;
(16 percent). On the other hand, industries with the lowest subsidy component&#13;
were leather and fur (4.5 percent) and cement (6 percent).&#13;

V. Foreign Exchange Allocation and Duty-Free Imports.&#13;
Exporters who hold TUB's Export Encouragement Certificates or letter&#13;
of credit can apply to get foreign exchange for their import needs and/or&#13;
receive the right to duty-free imports up to the amount of the allocated&#13;
foreign exchange. The latter, until the end of 1983 could not normally exceed&#13;
60 percent of the pledged export value 1/. After December 1983 this&#13;
proportion was reduced to 40 percent. For exporters requesting more than 60&#13;
(or, later, 50) percent of export value as foreign exchange allocation,&#13;
special screening was made. In that case also, the tax rebates were not paid&#13;
on the whole amount of exports but only on the net foreign exchange earned.&#13;
In view of importance of tax rebates for exporters, the measure discouraged&#13;
high claims on foreign exchange.&#13;
The incentive value of the foreign exhange allocation scheme is&#13;
twofold. First, it gives right to duty-free imports of intermediate and raw&#13;
materials. The amount of duties thus saved represents the subsidy. Second,&#13;
foreign currency generally commanded a premium over its official rate, which&#13;
could be appropriated by the recipient. However, as the overvaluation of the&#13;
1/   It does not include the exporter's own foreign exchange which might have&#13;
been retained from his previous exports earnings. After the&#13;
liberalization of foreign exchange accounts in December 1983, allowing&#13;
Turkish citizens residing in Turkey to hold them, all foreign exchange -&#13;
no matter how acquired - owned by the exporter could be used for imports&#13;
(provided, of course, import regime restrictions, e.g. if the imported&#13;
good requires a license or is banned, are cleared).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
TL gradually decreased the premium diminished. It is estimated that the&#13;
premium which in 1980 exceeded 12 percent, declined to less than 7 percent in&#13;
1981, and then 4.5 percent in 1982. In 1983 the premium again increased (to&#13;
an average of about 13 percent), and then was virtually eliminated in 1984.&#13;
Also, it became more difficult to estimate the premium since the "flex-price"&#13;
regime whereby exporters could transfer their foreign exhange to their&#13;
suppliers, and presumably charge them the full market price, was replaced in&#13;
1982 by the system where the exporters could use the foreign exchange only for&#13;
their own input needs. If a firm could not obtain foreign exchange, the&#13;
premium theoretically became highly specific, e.g. equal to, say, loss of&#13;
output due to inability to acquire imported inputs. The foreign exchange&#13;
premium was thus highly individualized whereas, across the economy as a whole,&#13;
it became much smaller. In our calculations the subsidy element due to the&#13;
foreign exchange premium is assumed nil.&#13;
Table V.1 shows the evolution of the foreign exchange allocation&#13;
scheme for the manufacturing sector. The estimated average subsidy element&#13;
(the value of the subsidy measured against the total exports) remained between&#13;
4 and 5 percent in the 1980-1983 period and then dropped to 3 percent in&#13;
1984. The foreign exchange allocated as a proportion of exports increased&#13;
from between 15 to 17 percent in 1980-82 to 25 percent in 1983. It was not&#13;
accompanied by a similar increase in the subsidy element because the structure&#13;
of the allocated foreign exchange shifted toward the industries with&#13;
relatively lower import tariff rates, where the subsidy conferred by the saved&#13;
duties, is smaller. The decline in the subsidy component of the scheme in&#13;
1984 occured both because foreign exchange allocations were less (16 percent&#13;
of export value vs. 25 percent in 1983), and also because import&#13;
liberalization lowered tariff rates by, on the average 20 percent, so that the&#13;
worth of saved duties was also smaller.&#13;

In terms of individual industries subsidies are heavily concentrated&#13;
in four industries: non-ferrous metals, metal products, electrical machinery,&#13;
and transport equipment. These four industries receive by far the largest&#13;
subsidy (about 20 percent of the export value over the five years), although&#13;
their share in total allocated foreign exhange is broadly commensurate with&#13;
that of other industries. But some of them (e.g. metal products) have low&#13;
exports so that the allocated foreign exchange (and the subsidy) when&#13;
expressed in terms of exports become quite substantial. In effect, foreign&#13;
exchange allocations to the metal products industry exceeded its exports in&#13;
1981 and 1983.&#13;
The foreign exchange allocation subsidy component is significantly&#13;
greater in capital goods industries (it was relatively low in 1984,&#13;
12.4 percent, but exceeded 26 percent in 1980), than in the consumer (about&#13;
2 percent) and intermediate goods industries (between 4 and 6 percent). It is&#13;
due both to a greater allocation of foreign exchange to capital goods&#13;
industries (see Table V.2), and to higher tariffs on inputs used by them. All&#13;
major industrial groupings show the same pattern in terms of the behavior of&#13;
subsidy rates as the manufacturing sector as a whole: slight decline in 1981&#13;
and 1982, and an increase in 1983, bringing the subsidy conferred by the&#13;
scheme to the level at which it was in 1980. In 1984 the subsidy and foreign&#13;
exchange allocation as share of exports declined in all of them.&#13;

VI. Real Exchange Rate&#13;
Figure VI.l depicts the evolution of the real exhange rate of the&#13;
Turkish lira since the January 1980 devaluation 1/. It clearly shows the&#13;
three periods characterized by a rapid real devaluation (devaluation is shown&#13;
by an increase in value). The first begins with the daily adjustment of TL by&#13;
the Central Bank in May 1981, and ends by the close of the year. Between&#13;
these two dates TL depreciated in real terms by about 18 percent. The second&#13;
period, of a somewhat less sharp devaluation, extends from April 1982 to&#13;
August 1982: during that time TL depreciated by 7 percent in real terms.&#13;
This period coincided with the calming down of inflation in Turkey (reduced to&#13;
about 22 percent per annum), while the rate of nominal depreciation continued&#13;
more or less as in the past. For a whole year afterwards the real exchange&#13;
rate remained stable: practically no real devaluation occured between&#13;
August 1982 and July 1983. Beginning with December 1983 real exchange rate&#13;
began to depreciate fast again. In January 1985, in particular, the real&#13;
exchange rate depreciated by about 7 percent. This was due to the change in&#13;
the exchange rate regime whereby commercial banks were allowed to trade&#13;
foreign currencies at the spread of 6 percent below or above the daily rate&#13;
fixed by the Central Bank. (The spread was later increased to 8 percent). As&#13;
the banks tended immediately to push the rates to the upper bound of the&#13;
margin, this provided for a one shot devaluation of the lira. Since&#13;
April 1984 the process was reversed, and there was a steady real&#13;
appreciation: by December 1984 the real exchange rate of TL had appreciated -&#13;
comparatively to its level one year ago - by about 4 percent.&#13;
1/   The real exhange rate adjusts the nominal rate for the inflation&#13;
differential between Turkey and the five countries (USA, UK, France,&#13;
Germany, and Switzerland). The weights used are trade shares of each&#13;
of the countries in total Turkish trade in 1981.&#13;

VII. The Combined Export Subsidy: Optimal and Actual&#13;
(a) Total export subsidy. Total subsidy element to exports provided by the&#13;
three incentive schemes discussed above (tax rebates, preferential credit, and&#13;
foreign exchange allocation for duty-free imports) ranges between 23 (in 1983)&#13;
and 15 (in 1984) percent of the value of exports (see Table VII.1). In&#13;
effect, this proportion was fairly stable, at 20-21 percent for three&#13;
consecutive years (1980, 1981, 1982), and then increased slightly, to 23.4&#13;
percent in 1983. In 1984, however, for the reasons explained above, the&#13;
subsidy declined by more than a third to 15 percent of the export value.&#13;
The subsidy shows a seasonal pattern: it was often high in the first&#13;
quarter of the year, and relatively low in the last quarter. This was due to&#13;
a seasonal behavior of both subsidies and exports. Turkish exports in volume&#13;
terms show a tendency to accelerate in the last quarter of the year. This&#13;
has, combined with a depreciation of the lira, which was also particularly&#13;
pronounced toward the end of the year, led to a significant increase in TL&#13;
value of exports. The nominal value of subsidies on the other hand, has&#13;
tended to be the lowest in the last quarter due to the end of the year&#13;
stringencies. These include the need for the Central Bank to remain within&#13;
the credit ceilings and thus check the expansion of the discounted credits, as&#13;
well as shortage of funds to pay for tax rebates. It has thus led in 1983 and&#13;
1984 to the build-up of important arrears in both tax refunds due to exporters&#13;
and interest rate rebates for export credits due to commercial banks. The&#13;
exception to this seasonal pattern was 1980 (when as the different incentive&#13;
schemes expanded the subsidy to exports increased in every quarter), and 1984&#13;
(when a very sharp decline in tax rebates occured in the third quarter).&#13;

Table VII.2 shows the evolution of the structure of the export&#13;
subsidy. It is characterized by an increase in importance of tax rebates and&#13;
a reduction in importance of export credits. The value of export tax rebates&#13;
in overall subsidies increased from nil in 1980 and less than 18 percent in&#13;
1981 to about 50 percent in 1982 and 1983. In 1984, despite scaling down of&#13;
the scheme, its relative inportance further increased to almost three quarters&#13;
of total subsidies given to export. It was, of course, due to an even faster&#13;
decrease in importance of other subsidy components, and particularly&#13;
preferential export credits. The subsidy element contained in preferential&#13;
credits sharply decreased from representing 75 and 60 percent of the overall&#13;
value of subsidies in 1980 and 1981, to only 31 percent in 1982, and then to&#13;
28 percent in 1983. In 1984 preferential export credits accounted for only&#13;
7 percent of the overall subsidies to exports. The value of duty-free access&#13;
to imports has in relative terms remained at a fairly stable level, around 20&#13;
percent of the total subsidy to exports.&#13;

Figure VII.1 shows the importance of each of the three subsidy&#13;
schemes in the period I/1980-IV/1984.&#13;
As observed earlier, the total subsidy granted to exporters of&#13;
different types of goods has differed: it has consistently favored exporters&#13;
of capital goods over exporters of intermediate, and in particular, consumer&#13;
goods (see Figure VII.2). The subsidy component has thus been inversely&#13;
proportional to the importance of the type of goods in total Turkish&#13;
manufactured exports.    As Table VII.3 shows, consumer goods which have&#13;
accounted for between 53 and 63 percent of the total manufactured exports&#13;
received on the average only about 45 percent of the total subsidies. On the&#13;
other hand, capital goods whose share in manufactured exports was on the&#13;
average, less than 10 percent, received about 20 percent of the total&#13;
subsidies. The effect was that in the period 1980-83, the yearly average&#13;
subsidy in terms of export values ranged from a high 37-65 percent to&#13;
exporters of capital goods, to a moderate 18-27 percent to exporters of&#13;
intermediate goods, and to relatively low 16 to 18 percent to exporters of&#13;
consumer goods. In 1984, subsidies to all types of goods declines, although&#13;
the ranking between the main groups of industries remained unaffected:&#13;
capital goods still received the highest relative subsidy (about 24 percent of&#13;
export value), followed by intermediate (18 percent), and consumer goods&#13;
industries (12 percent). The range obviously was even wider when measured for&#13;
individual industries (see Table VII.4). Exporters of metal products,&#13;
electrical machinery, and non-ferrous metals which combined represent&#13;
4-5 percent of the total manufactured exports, received by far the highest&#13;
subsidies, averaging approximately 94, 62 and 49 percent of export value&#13;
respectively. On the other extreme, food products and textile exporters,&#13;
whose exports account for more than one-half of manufactured exports, received&#13;
on the average exports subsidies of about 11 and 19 percent only.&#13;

(b) Optimal and actual subsidies. The lopsided structure of export&#13;
incentives (e.g. directed toward industries with relatively low exports) may&#13;
yet be the optimal one if it encourages the industries which may possess a&#13;
comparative advantage. The optimal structure of export incentives should be&#13;
such as to stimulate exports of products which are just on the verge of the&#13;
comparative advantage and/or which in the future seem likely to develop a&#13;
comparative advantage 1/. In other words, the policy should be concentrated&#13;
on industries where the export subsidy can make a difference between an export&#13;
success and an export failure and should deemphasize support to industries&#13;
which are either very competitive (as to be able to sell internationally on&#13;
their own) or very inefficient (so that almost no amount of subsidy is likely&#13;
to help them move towards the more competitive range).&#13;
Table VII.5 thus divides all the manufacturing sectors into four&#13;
groups. First, industries where additional strong export support may be&#13;
justified, i.e. those with Domestic Resources Cost (DRC) between 1 and 1.4.&#13;
Second, those where a medium export subsidy may be needed to reinforce the&#13;
comparative advantage, or offset subsidies that foreign competitors may be&#13;
receiving (those with DRC between 0.7 and 1). Third, industries which should&#13;
either be able to fend it off alone (with DRCs less than 0.7), or those which&#13;
are fairly inefficient (with DRCs between 1.4 and 3) so that in both cases&#13;
only a very modest export subsidy may be warranted. And, fourth, industries&#13;
which are highly inefficient with the result that any export support may be&#13;
deemed wasteful (with DRCs in excess of 3). Compared to that scheme of&#13;
"optimal" subsidies is a classification of industries according to actual&#13;
subsidies received.&#13;
1/       The assumption is that the industries in the "grey area" of the&#13;
comparative advantage may, by judicious export incentives, be helped&#13;
to secure a "bridgehead" on the foreign market, and then, by&#13;
expanding output, reduce their unit costs, and thus establish, on a&#13;
more permanent basis, their export competitiveness.&#13;

between 1 and 1.4; medium if 0.7 DRC 1, low if 1.4 DRC 3 or if DRC 0.7,&#13;
nil if DRC 3. DRCs refer to 1981 and are taken from F. Yagci,&#13;
Production and Incentives in Turkish Manufacturing. For actuals: The&#13;
level of export subsidy is calculated in terms of the average annual&#13;
export subsidy for the whole manufacturing (in order to adjust for&#13;
variations in the average rate of subsidy and concentrate instead on&#13;
the relative export incentive given to various industries); high&#13;
subsidy if 30 percent and more above the average subsidy: medium&#13;
subsidy if between 30 percent below or above the average (i.e. between&#13;
0.7 and 1.3 of the average), low if more than 30 percent below the&#13;
average.&#13;
Absolute discrepancy shows the number of levels by which the actual&#13;
subsidy differs from the "optimal." The ranking is&#13;
High-Medium-Low-Nil. If the "optimal" subsidy is high, and the actual&#13;
is low (or vice versa) two "discrepancy points" are assigned; if the&#13;
"optimal" is medium, and the actual high, once discrepancy point is&#13;
assigned; if the rankings coincide no discrepancy point is assigned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
Table VII.5 illustrates the following points:&#13;
(1) The level of the discrepancy between the actual relative export&#13;
subsidies to industries, and the subsidies based on the estimate of the&#13;
comparative advantage (the "optimal" subsidies), increased up to 1982, and&#13;
then decreased marginally in 1983 and 1984. It went up from one-third of the&#13;
maximum distance from the optimal structure of subsidies to almost one-half 1/.&#13;
(2) The industries where the departure from the optimal level of&#13;
subsidy is the largest are, in descending order, non-ferrous metals, iron and&#13;
steel, paper products and chemicals . They all received export subsidies in&#13;
excess of what seems to be warranted on the basis of their estimated&#13;
comparative advantage (DRCs in all of them are in excess of 3). 2/ The&#13;
industry which, on the other hand, should receive larger subsidies is&#13;
non-electrical machinery.&#13;
The discrepancy between the actual and the optimal level of subsidies&#13;
by industries is also shown in Table VII.6. The plus (minus) sign in the&#13;
first column indicates that the industry has enjoyed more (less) incentives&#13;
than suggested by the comparative advantage analysis. As mentioned above, the&#13;
industries which seemed most favorized were non-ferrous metals, iron and&#13;
steel, paper and chemicals. The second column in Table VII.6 gives the&#13;
average rates of growth of exports (in value terms) in the 1980-1984 period.&#13;
1/ The maximum distance from the optimal structure is 36.&#13;
2/ This conclusion must be somewhat qualified for chemicals where there are&#13;
products in which Turkey does have a comparative advantage. One would&#13;
need to know a more disaggregated structure of export subsidies in order&#13;
to determine what proportion of them went into the comparative advantage&#13;
area. For non-ferrous metals, and iron and steel industries, the&#13;
Production and Incentives in Turkish Manufacturing by F. Yagci (1984)&#13;
study found production in most lines to be inefficient at world prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
We see that three of the four most favorized industries display a higher than&#13;
average rate of export growth (iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, and&#13;
paper). It thus suggests that the level of subsidies given was sufficient to&#13;
compensate for lack of export competitiveness.&#13;

Table VII.7 compares the relative levels of subsidies by industries&#13;
(relative with respect to their "optimal" level determined on the basis of&#13;
comparative advantage) and export growth in the 1980-1984 period. We see that&#13;
for four industries (leather and fur, paper, iron and steel, and non-ferrous&#13;
metals) high subsidies "paid off" in terms of higher than average export&#13;
growth registered by these industries although DRC calculations show them to&#13;
be non-competitive. For electrical machinery the situation is somewhat&#13;
different as the industry was found to be fairly efficient (DRC = 0.9), and,&#13;
thus, it might be assumed, high growth of exports could have been achieved&#13;
with less subsidies. On the other hand, chemicals, glass, and cement received&#13;
incentives in excess of what seemed to be economically warranted, while their&#13;
growth was below the manufacturing average. These industries are thus prime&#13;
candidates for a cut in the level of incentives. Conversely, non-electrical&#13;
machinery recorded a respectable export growth although the relative level of&#13;
incentives was low.  This would suggest that an increased support of that&#13;
industry could pay relatively high dividends in terms of export growth.&#13;

actual and optimal levels in Table VII.6: all industries where the divergence&#13;
is greater (smaller) than +4(-4) are considered as receiving too high (too&#13;
low) incentives.&#13;
Export growth is considered fast (slow) if the rate of growth exceeds 40&#13;
percent p.a. (is lower than 20 percent p.a.). Data are taken from Table VII.6&#13;

VIII. Subsidies, Real Exchange Rate and Volume of Exports.&#13;
The relationship between the two forms of incentives to exporters&#13;
(direct subsidies and real exchange rate devaluation) is shown in Table&#13;
VIII.1. A broadly unchanged level of direct subsidies (until 1984) was&#13;
accompanied by a steady, although staggered in time, real devaluation of TL.&#13;
In 1984 real exchange rate of TL has devalued by about 13 percent&#13;
comparatively to 1980. The level of total direct subsidies (from tax rebates,&#13;
preferential credits and foreign exchange allocations) has, between 1980 and&#13;
1982, remained more or less unchanged at between 20 and 22 percent, before&#13;
increasing to 23.4 percent in 1983. In 1984 it declined to 15 percent.&#13;
The real effective (or export) exchange rate (which is equal to the&#13;
real exchange rate augmented by the rate of direct subsidy to exporters)&#13;
declined in 1981 by about 7 percent from its average level during 1980.1/ In&#13;
the next two years it increased by respectively 8.5 and 5.5 percent (see Table&#13;
VIII.1), before declining by 3 percent in 1984. During all these three years&#13;
the level of the real export exchange rate remained above its level in the&#13;
beginning of the period (1980). Yet the downward movement in real export&#13;
exchange rate begun in the second half of 1984 (reduction of direct subsidies&#13;
was accompanied by a real appreciation of the TL) meant that by the fourth&#13;
quarter of 1984, the overall level of direct and indirect export incentives&#13;
was about the same as in the first quarter of 1980. Figure VIII.1 shows the&#13;
level of the real effective exchange rate, and the breakdown between indirect&#13;
(exchange rate devaluation), and direct incentives (the subsidies).&#13;
1/ Decrease in the real (effective) exchange rate implies lower level of&#13;
incentives for exports (See note at Table VIII.l).&#13;

Table VIII.2 depicts the relationship between the real exchange rate&#13;
and volume of manufacturing exports. The equations relate volume of exports&#13;
(of all manufacturing, consumer, intermediate, and capital goods) to the level&#13;
of the real effective exchange rate for the corresponding category. These&#13;
results show: (a) a close correlation between the volume of manufactured&#13;
exports and the level of incentives; (b) that a one percent increase in the&#13;
level of incentives (coming either through a real exchange rate devaluation or&#13;
an increase in direct subsidies) is associated with an increase in volume of&#13;
exports in the same quarter of 2.8 percent; (c) that the responsiveness of&#13;
manufacturing exports to incentives is higher in consumer than in intermediate&#13;
and capital goods industries. This suggests that an increase in the level of&#13;
direct export subsidies in consumer goods industries (where they are the&#13;
lowest) may be viewed as a relatively efficient way to further export growth.&#13;

exchange rate, so that incentives to exporters go up when either TL&#13;
devalues in real terms or direct subisides increase.&#13;

The equations are fitted through the origin on the assumption that at&#13;
an extremely overvalued exchange rate (when the real exchange rate&#13;
approaches zero) exports would be nil. Numbers in parantheses show&#13;
the level of significance of t-values.&#13;

IX. Subjective Perception of the Importance of Incentives&#13;
The previous sections provided an estimate of the importance of&#13;
different direct and indirect incentives to Turkish exporters. However, it is&#13;
indispensible to compare "objective" importance of the incentives (calculated&#13;
as the subsidy component of total value of exports), to the perception of&#13;
their importance by the industrialists. This essentially raises the following&#13;
problem: if the perception of particular incentives differs significantly&#13;
from their calculated "true" incentive value, the policy based purely on an&#13;
estimate of the "true" incentive value is bound to be fairly inefficient. It&#13;
is true, that in the long-run, the "objective" worth of an incentive and its&#13;
perceptions would tend to coincide, but wide discrepancies may exist in the&#13;
short-run, the period with which the economic policy is mostly concerned. As&#13;
perceptions, rather than the "objective" calculations of the averages,&#13;
determine the behavior, it seems useful to complement calculations of the&#13;
"true" value of incentives by interviews assessing how different incentives&#13;
are perceived by those at whom they are aimed.&#13;
Table IX.1 shows schematically how the export incentives policy was&#13;
viewed by a sample of six exporting firms. The firms in the sample are&#13;
export-oriented: they exported about 40-50 percent of their output in 1984&#13;
when the interviews were made. Their total exports in 1984 were estimated at&#13;
about $170 million (2.5 percent of total Turkey's exports). All of the firms&#13;
registered fast export growth in the period 1980-84; in effect, for all of&#13;
them the shift toward exports occured around 1980 and 1981. By far the most&#13;
important "export shift factor" (cited by all the interviewed firms) was&#13;
depressed domestic demand after the lauching of the stablization program in&#13;
1980. The firms were thus clearly compelled to look abroad for outlets to&#13;
their production. This, in particular, since most of the firms completed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
significant investment programs (financed with relatively cheap foreign&#13;
exchange) in the mid- and late-1970, so that both their capacity and the&#13;
overhead costs were relatively high. Conditions of depressed domestic demand&#13;
were brought to bear on the firms even more through unavailability and/or high&#13;
cost of the general short-term credit. The opening up of Middle Eastern&#13;
markets provided, for some of the firms, a timely respite from the&#13;
stringencies of the austerity policies at home.&#13;

When it comes to individual export incentives, the interviewed firms&#13;
were generally concerned (three out of the six) by the reduction of export tax&#13;
rebates. Firms which were not affected by their gradual removal are in the&#13;
agro-processing where tax rebates were relatively low even before the&#13;
reduction. Cost of export credit was perceived to be high as the differential&#13;
between the cost of the general and the export credit was being reduced. It&#13;
is a high value of that differential which was, as we have seen, responsible&#13;
in several instances for a shift toward exports and away from the domestic&#13;
market. Yet the decrease in the subsidy (differential) alone did not seem&#13;
likely to lead to a retranchment of exports. Finally, most of the firms&#13;
enjoyed duty-free imports of inputs used in production for export.&#13;
In the ranking of export incentives by their perceived importance,&#13;
export tax rebates come on the top in four cases out of five (availability of&#13;
credit is cited once as a most important incentive). The perception of&#13;
importance of tax rebates closely matches the "objective" importance of the&#13;
scheme. It may be mentioned in addition, that exporters often tend to regard&#13;
the overall amount paid of the tax rebates (cash payment) as the incentive&#13;
without deducting the indirect taxes incurred. This view thus implicitly&#13;
assumes that all of indirect taxes are borne by the producer when selling at&#13;
the domestic market. Although this may be an extreme position, it is&#13;
nevertheless quite plausible that one part of these taxes is borne by the&#13;
producer, in which case the incentive value of the scheme is greater than&#13;
simply the difference between the tax rebates received and indirect taxes&#13;
incurred. Export credit is mentioned twice (one first, and one second place)&#13;
as an important incentive. The fact that export credit (or, equivalently,&#13;
high cost of general credit) was viewed as an important factor in reorienting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
enterprises toward exports is not inconsistent with a much lower importance&#13;
assigned to it at the time of the interview (1984): in effect, the subsidy&#13;
element contained in export credits was significantly less in 1984 than in&#13;
1980-81 when most of the firms shifted their production toward exports.&#13;
Duty-free imports were found relatively unimportant, probably because the&#13;
interviewed firms already enjoyed them for a while, and thus tended to take&#13;
them for granted. Direct income tax deduction were often mentioned: in two&#13;
instances as the second, and in two instances, as the third most important&#13;
incentive. Finally, exchange rate policy was quoted three times as an&#13;
important incentive for exports: twice as the second most important, and once&#13;
as the third.&#13;
The ranking of export incentives is summarized in Table IX.2, and&#13;
then compared to the "true" calculated value of different incentives in 1984.&#13;
Although, the interviewed sample differs from the overall population of&#13;
exporters we observe significant similarities between the "objective" worth of&#13;
incentives (i.e. their subsidy component) and the perception of their&#13;
importance. Export tax rebates and direct tax deductions were both perceived&#13;
and "objectively" found to be the two most important export incentives.&#13;
Perception of the real devaluation of TL as an impetus to exports also&#13;
coincides with the actual developments in 1984. Export credits and duty-free&#13;
imports, however, display the inverted ranking comparatively to the one&#13;
according to their subsidy component in 1984. The reasons for that seem to be&#13;
twofold. First, the interviews were conducted in the first half of 1984 when&#13;
the shortening of maturity export credits was too recent to have been fully&#13;
felt, and the new level of subsidy contained in export credits to be more&#13;
accurately perceived. The interviewees probably tended to think of the worth&#13;
of the export credit in the time of its greater importance in 1983, and&#13;
earlier years. Second, all of the interviewed enterprises enjoyed duty-free&#13;
imports&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
of inputs for a significant period period of time, and tended to take these&#13;
rights for granted, which probably made them discount heavily saved import&#13;
duties.&#13;

and each following incentive 1 point less (minimum = 1 point).&#13;
**    For tax rebates, export credits and duty-free imports subsidy as&#13;
percentage of export value in 1984; data taken from Table VII.2. For&#13;
the exchange rate, percentage of real devaluation in 1984. For&#13;
direct tax deductions, value of average tax deductions for&#13;
incorporated enterprises (see p. 8).&#13;
On balance, the analysis suggests that the correspondence between the&#13;
''true" and the perceived value of different incentives is fairly close,&#13;
although a long and continuous existence of one incentive tends to blunt&#13;
exporters' awareness to its worth. This is particularly the case when the&#13;
incentive scheme itself does not contain a very high subsidy element. In&#13;
other words, it is more difficult to conceive that even if export tax rebates&#13;
were kept unchanged for as long a period as the one during which the&#13;
interviewed enterprises enjoyed duty-free imports, their importance would be&#13;
discounted by exporters. This is so both because tax rebates are more&#13;
important, and there is an explicit cash payment to the exporter, which does&#13;
not exist in import duty exemptions. With these caveats in mind, broad&#13;
coincidence between the real value of incentives and their perception is&#13;
comforting because it represents an essential precondition for the&#13;
effectiveness of economic policy.&#13;

X. An assessment of the role of direct export incentives&#13;
Growth of Turkish exports in the period 1980-84 has been nothing&#13;
short of spectacular. At the time when the overall world trade contracted by&#13;
about 1 percent per annum Turkish exports registered an average annual growth&#13;
in excess of 25 percent p.a. Particularly noteworthy was the performance of&#13;
industrial exports which grew at the rate of 49 percent per annum and whose&#13;
share in total export doubled in four years. It is true that Turkey's&#13;
interest have been served favorably during this period by a few exogeneous&#13;
developments, in particular by the Iranian revolution and the outbreak of the&#13;
Iran-Iraq war (respectively in February 1979 and September 1980). The&#13;
revolution cut Iran from its major suppliers, and necessitated a reorientation&#13;
of its trade. The war, thanks to geographical proximity of Turkey, and the&#13;
adopted neutral stance toward the belligerants, increased demand for Turkish&#13;
exports by both countries. Total exports to Iran and Iraq thus passed from&#13;
$220 million in 1980 to almost $1.7 billion in 1984 (rate of growth of&#13;
66 percent per annum). Imports from Turkey accounted for an estimated&#13;
6 percent of total Iranian 1984 imports, and 9 percent of total Iraqi imports&#13;
(jumping from 0.8 and 1.1 percent respectively in 1980). Although it is&#13;
probable that Turkish export performance would have been, in the absence of&#13;
these two developments, less impressive, it is nevertheless true that without&#13;
an export policy, as followed in the 1980-84 period, this opportunity could&#13;
have easily gone unused. Devaluation of the TL, introduction of direct export&#13;
incentives, repressed domestic demand, and a general emphasis on exports after&#13;
1980, have encouraged (sometimes even obliged) industrialists to look to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
exports as a way out of difficulties. It is only because the overall context&#13;
was propitious to exports, that industrialists were able to seize upon the&#13;
opportunities offered by the Iranian revolution, and the Iran-Iraq war. To&#13;
quote Pasteur, "Le hasard ne profite qu'aux esprits prepare's".&#13;
The main questions that one would hope to be able to answer after a&#13;
study of export incentives are the following: "Were export incentives&#13;
instrumental in effecting a change toward greater export orientation", and&#13;
"Will the export orientation persist later even in face of declining direct&#13;
subsidies". Ideally, if the answer to the two questions were in the&#13;
affirmative, namely, that subsidies were necessary to change the orientation&#13;
of the economy, and that once this is accomplished they can be safely&#13;
withdrawn, a strong case for a policy of temporary export subsidies could be&#13;
established. Turkish evidence to date suggests that this is indeed the case.&#13;
First, introduction of an explicit export encouragement policy - with&#13;
the level of incentives, both direct and through exchange rate devaluation,&#13;
much higher than in the past - produced a definite change in the mentality of&#13;
industrialists. It was the period best characterized by the "export or&#13;
perish" dictum. Industrialists started, some of them for the first time, to&#13;
look seriously at foreign markets. A casual evidence, such as the number of&#13;
Turkish businessmen encountered in places where none of them could be met only&#13;
a few years ago strengthens this impression. From the government point of&#13;
view, the success of the export drive became almost synonomous with the&#13;
success of the stabilization program. The government thus remained strongly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
and persistently committed to encouragement of exports. This, in turn,&#13;
strengthened industrialists' emerging orientation towards foreign markets, as&#13;
they gradually grew more aware both of exports' preferential treatment and of&#13;
the fact that the government's policy in this respect was not likely to&#13;
change. Furthermore, the first export successes reinforced the confidence of&#13;
the economy that it could effectively compete internationally. The&#13;
combination of all these self-reinforcing effects produced the "export&#13;
miracle" of 1980-84.&#13;
It would seem that the three clearly identifiable elements were&#13;
necessary to effect this change: (a) government's strong commitment to&#13;
exports, and the general perception that it would not slacken, (b) increased&#13;
export incentives, and (c) relatively favorable external developments. This&#13;
is diagrammatically shown in Figure X.l.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
Direct subeidies clearly played a major role in the element (b), and&#13;
although their existence alone could not have been sufficient to effect the&#13;
reorientation of the economy, it is probably fair to aver that, alike the&#13;
other two elements, they were a necessary condition for success.&#13;
To go to our second question, What are the prospects for Turkish&#13;
exports in the years ahead when direct incentives are to be gradually phased&#13;
out? To answer this question, one needs first to complement the picture of&#13;
export success drawn above by considering also tensions that the preferential&#13;
treatment of exports, and the export-orientation in general, have produced in&#13;
the economy, as well as the quarters from which the backlash against that&#13;
policy may come. Obviously, producers for the domestic market, unable to&#13;
compete internationally, were hurt first. This occurred through a change in&#13;
their relative position vis-a-vis exporters (both through greater incentives&#13;
to exporters and depressed domestic demand), and by a liberalization of&#13;
imports which the government undertook with particular force in 1984. There&#13;
is thus little doubt that their relative position deterioriated. They were&#13;
also the ones most affected by persistently high interest rates on general&#13;
credits (the rates for which preferential credits to exports were partly to&#13;
blame). Also the policy of export encouragement was not uniform towards all&#13;
exporters. As we have seen, it consistently favored producers of capital&#13;
goods over consumer and intermediate goods industries, and, in addition, gave&#13;
special incentives to large exporters. Additional tax rebates for large&#13;
exporters (see Section III) have existed since the inception of the scheme.&#13;
In 1984, with the introduction of the concept of Foreign Trade Corporations,&#13;
that is, large trading firms with the volume of exports in excess of&#13;
$3U million per annuml, and paid-up capital of at least TL 500 billion&#13;
1/   Later raised to $50 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
(t1.7 million at January 1984 exchange rate), this aspect was reinforced.&#13;
Only Foreign Trade Corporations, among private finns, were allowed to engage&#13;
in often profitable trade with countries with the nationalized foreign trade&#13;
(essentially CMEA countries).   For the purpose of export incentive policy they&#13;
were treated as industrial firms, although they were essentially commercial&#13;
establishments. Credit allocations to Foreign Trade Corporations were made&#13;
separately (i.e. outside the allocations by industries, since their exports&#13;
covered a broad range of products). Additional tax rebates paid to large&#13;
exporters often gave rise to special preying of large exporters over the&#13;
small: the latter, instead of selling goods themselves to a foreign company&#13;
which they identified, would sell goods to the foreign trade corporations with&#13;
which they would later split the additional tax rebate. Although both sides&#13;
benefitted by such a clever use of the government regulations, these&#13;
transactions - where the large companies were seen by the small exporters to&#13;
be receiving a commission for no work, and solely because of their size--often&#13;
alerted small exporters to the inequity of the government's policy.&#13;
Enterprises which could normally be expected to hail government export policy&#13;
were thus often lukewarm toward it (or rather toward its specific&#13;
manifestations).&#13;
It seems at present unlikely that the business interests, fully or&#13;
partially affected by the export-encouragement policy as pursued by the&#13;
government since 1980, will be strong enough to produce a reversal of that&#13;
policy. The pressure for a reversal may even be lessening as the government&#13;
reduces (as it is currently doing) most of direct export incentives.&#13;
Elimination of preferential export credits, and a reduction in inflation&#13;
should also produce a decrease in nominal interest rates, and assuage the&#13;
opposition of most heavily-indebted firms. The differential treatement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
granted to large export firms is less likely to disappear, as the government&#13;
views centralization in export activity as the surest way to increase exports,&#13;
and to reap benefits of the economies of scale which may exist in&#13;
international marketing, and entrepreneurship.l/ An extrapolation of&#13;
current developments then seems to suggest that in the years to come, some of&#13;
the antagonisms between the gainers and the losers from the government policy&#13;
may be reduced (by a combination of the effects of stronger domestic demand,&#13;
and smaller direct export incentives), while the export growth will not be&#13;
adversely affected. Although the unique combination of circumstances in the&#13;
period 1980-84 will not reoccur, and the export growth may slow down (which in&#13;
view of a very low export base from which it started in 1980 is no surprise),&#13;
the prospect for the immediate future is at least the consolidation of export&#13;
gains so far achieved, and most likely a moderate expansion of Turkey's share&#13;
in the world trade. The return to status quo ante is difficult to imagine,&#13;
which is probably the best testimony of the correctness of the policies.&#13;
1/ Foreign Trade Corporations accounted for 36.8 percent of total exports in&#13;
1984, up from 29.1 percent which was the share of these companies in 1983.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Since the introduction of the
            stabilization program in Turkey in January 1980, export
            growth has occupied a crucial role in Turkey's
            development strategy. This represented a major departure
            from the hitherto followed inward-looking strategy of import
            substitution. In the changed environment the success on the
            export front became a sine qua non for the success of the
            new policy as a whole. The Government, which centralized the
            administration of export incentives and increased their
            importance, gave strong indications that it would follow
            through with this policy. Turkish exports responded
            strongly: in the period 1980-84 they increased from $2.9
            billion to $7.1 billion. Increased export incentives were
            instrumental in stimulating export growth. These incentives
            included continuous depreciation of the exchange rate,
            payment of tax rebates, access to subsidized export credits,
            and duty-free imports of necessary inputs for exports.
