1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1          Peru's twenty-three million people live in an area of 1.3 million km2.&#13;
About 10 percent of the land area is located along a narrow desert-like coastal strip&#13;
(Costa) between the Pacific Ocean and the foothills of the Andes; 30 percent is&#13;
mountainous (Sierra), made up of the valleys and western plateaus of the Andes; and&#13;
60 percent lies in the Amazon watershed (Selva), comprised of the valleys and eastern&#13;
plateaus of the Andes and the Amazon jungle. The coastal desert holds 53 percent of the&#13;
population, including the capital Lima which accounts for about a third of the population.&#13;
1.2          From the late 1960s until about 1990, economic and agricultural policies in&#13;
Peru were characterized by heavy Government intervention. Since 1990, the Government&#13;
has taken measures to liberalize the economy. Price controls, negative interest rates and&#13;
preferential exchange rates have been eliminated. The agrarian reform law has been&#13;
repealed to allow for the opening of a land market. Import duties for agricultural products&#13;
are being reduced. The Government has embarked on a massive land titling process&#13;
scheduled to be finalized by the year 2000. The land and water law, proposed to&#13;
Congress, would give private property rights to water and other natural resources. The&#13;
financing of the rural sector would be channeled through COFIDE (as second-tier bank),&#13;
the private banks and the loan and savings societies.&#13;
1.3          In November 1994, the Government requested the Bank to prepare and&#13;
finance part of an overall plan tackling the water and natural resources management&#13;
problems in the Sierra. The proposed project would focus on the seven most poverty&#13;
stricken departments in the country, leaving room for other donors to finance similar&#13;
activities in other departments. A parallel project would be financed by the Overseas&#13;
Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan. The Swiss Government and CARE are also&#13;
financing parts of the program. Project preparation missions took place in August and&#13;
October 1995, pre-appraisal in February/March 1996 and appraisal in May/June 19961.&#13;
The loan was negotiated in November 1996.&#13;
This project has been prepared by Mr. P. Werbrouck (Sr. Agricultural Economist - LA3NR),&#13;
Mr. I. Marzall (Agronomist - FAO/CP), Mrs. M.E. Castro (Social Scientist - LA3HR), Mr. M. Asad&#13;
(Economist - LA3NR), Mrs. S. Raswant (Financial Analyst - Consultant) and Tng. J. Escurra&#13;
(Consultant). The project has been appraised by Messrs. P. Werbrouck, I. Marzall and J. Escurra.&#13;
Ms. G. Sakata and Ms. A. Domenech assisted with the production of the report. Mr. J. Parker is the&#13;

2. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. THE MACRo-ECONOMIC SITUATION&#13;
2.1         Over the last five years, the orientation of the Peruvian economy has&#13;
dramatically changed from the dominance of the state to the private sector, with the state&#13;
retaining and strengthening its role as regulator. Reforms included: a sweeping&#13;
privatization program, trade liberalization, the removal of most state intervention in&#13;
banking services, and elimination of price controls and public monopolies. The economy&#13;
has reacted positively to the reform program. Inflation decreased from a high of 7,650&#13;
percent in 1990 to 12 percent in 1995. The economy grew by 12.9 percent in 1994 but&#13;
economic growth declined to 7 percent in 1995. Population living in poverty declined&#13;
from 55 percent in 1991 to 49.6 percent in 1994. Although the income distribution has&#13;
improved during the past two years, it is still worse than the Latin American average. The&#13;
1994 income per capita is estimated at US$1,890.&#13;
2.2         Much remains to be done to ensure that the benefits of economic reforms&#13;
continue. Further steps are needed toward trade liberalization. Public institutions need to&#13;
be further restructured and strengthened at the central level to act as promoters and&#13;
regulators of the provision of public services. Local governments need further autonomy&#13;
in decision-making, with adequate financial arrangements that match responsibilities for&#13;
service provision. Structure and enforcement of tax collection need to be further&#13;
improved. Public sector accountability need to be further increased. And greater efforts&#13;
in human capital development through education and health are necessary to sustain&#13;
private sector development and decrease poverty.&#13;
2.3         Poverty is still widespread in the Sierra and in urban slums. In the face of&#13;
overwhelming problems in the social sectors, particularly for the indigenous community,&#13;
the Government established in 1990 a social emergency program to provide direct food&#13;
and health assistance to the poor. The program was replaced in 1991 by FONCODES&#13;
(the National Fund for Social Compensation and Development), a mechanism for&#13;
channeling Government and donor resources to labor-intensive projects. FONCODES has&#13;
become Government's main instrument to reduce rural poverty from 20 to 15 percent in&#13;
1995. The results of FONCODES and the Bank-financed Social Development and&#13;
Compensation Fund Project are encouraging: projects have been targeted to poor areas,&#13;
demand-driven and executed locally.&#13;
2.4         The incidence of rural poverty is the highest in the rural Sierra, which is&#13;
estimated to contain the largest number of the poor (1.6 million people).2 Two-thirds of&#13;
the Sierra households are poor and 47 percent are extremely poor. Poorer households in&#13;
the Sierra tend to be involved in agriculture. Land titling, small-scale irrigation works, and&#13;
measures to increase crop and livestock productivity have yielded strong contributions to&#13;
poverty alleviation.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
B. THE RURAL SECTOR&#13;
2.5          Agriculture is not the main engine of growth in Peru. The potentially&#13;
cultivable area is estimated at only six percent of the total area. Per capita availability of&#13;
cultivable land is only 0.13 ha, less than one-third the average in South America. An&#13;
additional 14 percent is suitable for livestock and 38 percent for forestry. The remaining&#13;
42 percent is either desert, mountains or protected land. The coastal area has only&#13;
21 percent of the cultivable land but produces 60 percent of the agricultural GDP.&#13;
2.6          Peru's most important crops, in terms of production value, are rice, cotton,&#13;
sugarcane, coffee, meat, eggs and milk. Coffee, sugar and cotton are exported. They&#13;
amount to eight percent of total exports. Agriculture and livestock represent about&#13;
13 percent of GDP, employ 35 percent of the active population and grow at an annual&#13;
average rate of 2.8 percent since 1980 (13 percent in 1994 and 7.4 percent in 1995).&#13;
2.7          Production in the Sierra consists mainly of potatoes, corn, quinoa cereals&#13;
and livestock (cattle and llamas). Productivity is very low because of the erratic climate,&#13;
steep topography, irregular rainfall and traditional production technologies.&#13;
C. RURAL POLICY AND STRATEGY&#13;
2.8          The main rural policy objective of the Government is to convert the present&#13;
subsistence agriculture into a modern and competitive sector to stimulate rural income and&#13;
economic growth. To achieve this objective, the Government intends to encourage the&#13;
integration of the farming community in the market economy by attracting private&#13;
investment in agriculture and stimulating creation of rural communal enterprises.&#13;
Government would fulfill a normative role, in directing and promoting agricultural&#13;
investment, and creating a stable juridical framework with clear rules to promote&#13;
productive activities, intervening with transparency and punctually only when the market&#13;
does not operate adequately.&#13;
2.9          To implement this policy Government has adopted the following economic&#13;
principles: (i) macroeconomic stability; (ii) flexible labor markets; (iii) restructuring of the&#13;
financial system including development finance; (iv) elimination of all subsidies and state&#13;
intervention in the produce and input markets; (v) liberalization of imports and exports&#13;
and elimination of tariffs on international trade; (vi) elimination of state monopolies in&#13;
produce and input marketing; and (vii) repeal the Agrarian Reform Law.&#13;
2.10         The Government has elaborated a strategy to prepare the sector for the&#13;
next century3. In broad terms, it would: (i) promote producer-owned commercial&#13;
organizations (Empresas Comunales y Multicomunales), savings and loan associations,&#13;
marketing and service cooperatives and similar organizations; (ii) title and register land&#13;
properties and create an active land market; (iii) create rural finance mechanisms on&#13;

commercial terms involving the savings and loan associations providing credit to&#13;
medium-sized entrepreneurs, community revolving funds as social compensation&#13;

investment in irrigation projects to reduce costs and promote private investment, and&#13;
reorient public expenditure towards works which have clear social or external benefits and&#13;
can increase productivity and efficiency of the existing infrastructure; (v) strengthen the&#13;
national research system, rural extension and technology transfer with a strong&#13;
participation of the private sector; (vi) assist the Sierra communities to take responsibility&#13;
for natural resource management and reforestation; (vii) implement agricultural policy&#13;

(ix) direct support to producer Organizaciones Empresariales through training in&#13;
management and credit lines for operation and consolidation.&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONS&#13;
2.11         Rural development institutions involved in rural development in the Sierra&#13;
include institutions related to the Ministry of Agriculture (MAG), the Ministry of the&#13;
Presidency (NP) and private organizations (NGOs, training institutes).&#13;
2.12         Ministry of Agriculture. MAG has central headquarters in Lima and&#13;
directorates in 11 regions and sub-directorates in all geographical departments. MAG's&#13;
central structure is duplicated in each of the Directorates. MAG staff (including project&#13;
staff) amounts to about 4,300 including 577 managers, 1,381 professionals, and 2,169&#13;
technicians. In addition to its normative role, MAG controls three projects: the Special&#13;
Project for Land Titling (PETT), the National Project for the Management of Watershed&#13;
Basins and Soil Conservation (PRONAMACHCS) and the Project for Strengthczning&#13;
Agricultural Extension Services in the Sierra (FEAS). The Peruvian Indigenous Institute&#13;
(IIP) is also integrated into MAG. Four public organizations are part of MAG: (i) the&#13;
National Agrarian Research Institute (INIA); (ii) the National Agrarian Sanitation Service&#13;
(SENASA); (iii) the National Natural Resources Institute (INRENA); and (iv) the&#13;
National Council for the production of South American Camels.&#13;
2.13         PRONAMACHCS was created in 1981 as a soil conservation project&#13;
financed by USAID. Since 1986, it is-being financed by the National Treasury and since&#13;
1994 it also implements small-scale irrigation and reforestation community projects. It has&#13;
a staff of 1,100 people and 66 branches operating in 16 of the 24 departments and reaches&#13;
more than 2,000 communities in the Sierra. Since 1990 it has carried out 40,760 ha in soil&#13;
conservation, 523 small-scale irrigation works (180,000 ha), and 57,000 ha of forest&#13;
plantations. Its 1996 budget amounts to US$67 million, US$42 million of which are to be&#13;
financed by the Treasury. PRONAMACHCS operating costs amount to US$16 million&#13;
(25 percent of the total planned budget).4&#13;
4 The 1995 budget amounted tovUS$53 million but only US$20 million has been realized because of&#13;
fund shortages at the Treasury.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
2.14        IIP. The Peruvian Indigenous Institute has operated since 1947 and has&#13;
been part of MAG since 1993. It carries out the governmental indigenous people policy,&#13;
studies and socioeconomic research of the problems and needs of the indigenous people.&#13;
IIP is the official agency for all actions the Government undertakes in favor of indigenous&#13;
people. It is tied to the Instituto Indigenista Interamericano of the Organization of&#13;
American States. Among its achievements are: (i) the ethno-linguistic map of Peru;&#13;
(ii) the community poverty map; and (iii) a directory of indigenous communities. IIP&#13;
would carry out monitoring studies of the project impact on indigenous people.&#13;
2.15        INRENA promotes the sustainable use and conservation of natural&#13;
resources. It carries out soil degradation and soil rehabilitation studies, natural resource&#13;
assessments, and produces natural resource and land use maps. INRENA is also in charge&#13;
of environmental assessments of projects in the agrarian sector and monitors the&#13;
implementation of environmental mitigation measures. INRENA would study the&#13;
productive potential of the micro-catchments in the project.&#13;
2.16        FEAS is financed by IFAD and promotes the development of a private&#13;
agricultural extension sector. It operates mainly in the departments of Piura, Cajamarca,&#13;
Puno, Moquegua and Tacna until 1999. FEAS finances technical assistance to rural&#13;
communities on a declining basis (90 to 50 percent) over a period of three years. FEAS is&#13;
providing technical assistance to communities in the project area.&#13;
2.17        FONCODES operates under the Ministry of the Presidency and finances&#13;
on a grant basis investment projects in the education, health and basic infrastructure&#13;
sectors. Since 1995 it is involved in the productive sectors. In 1994 it carried out 4,760&#13;
projects for a total of US$171 million. It receives financing from the National Treasury,&#13;
the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank and other donors. FONCODES&#13;
and PRONAMACHCS have a cooperation agreement to complement each others&#13;
programs.&#13;
2.18        Non-Government Organizations. The number of NGOs active in the&#13;
rural sector are estimated between 750 and 1,250. The NGOs active in the rural areas&#13;
provide education, training, technical assistance, and marketing. They have little&#13;
experience in natural resources management and some have a paternalistic approach to&#13;
rural development. NGOs would be involved in the institutional strengthening of the&#13;
communities in the project area.&#13;
2.19        Community Enterprises. MAG has promoted the creation of community&#13;
and multi-community enterprises since 1993. Their number has increased to 600 in 1995&#13;
and they are mainly involved in processing of agricultural products. MAG fosters an&#13;
intensive training program in small enterprise management directed to the leaders of these&#13;
enterprises. The project would further support to the development of these entities.&#13;

3. BANK STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS&#13;
A. BANK ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
3.1         The Bank resumed lending to Peru in 1991 with a strategy designed to&#13;
support the Government's macro-economic and structural adjustment programs. Since&#13;
1993, poverty reduction has become the central objective of the Bank strategy in Peru.&#13;
To achieve this objective, the Bank concentrates its investment lending in infrastructure&#13;
and the social sectors. Projects with FONCODES, in Basic Health and Nutrition, Basic&#13;
Education and Rural Roads Rehabilitation combine poverty alleviation objectives with&#13;
investments in rehabilitation and maintenance of neglected public services. The Bank also&#13;
finances technical assistance in support of privatization and development of a&#13;
complementary regulatory and legal framework.&#13;
B. BANK GROUP OPERATIONS&#13;
3.2         Before 1993 the Bank had financed 64 loans for a total of US$2.2 billion.&#13;
Up to November 1996, the Bank had financed another US$1.35 billion, US$400 million&#13;
(30 percent) of which were destined to privatization adjustment loans, US$430 million&#13;
(32 percent) to social sector projects, US$180 million (13 percent) to standard&#13;
privatization loans, and US$240 million (18 percent) to the transport sector. In FY97 the&#13;
Bank has also approved an irrigation rehabilitation loan (US$85 million). IEFC operations&#13;
amount to US$112 million.&#13;
C. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
3.3         As per the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Peru5, poverty&#13;
reduction is the central objective of the Bank's involvement. This is to be achieved&#13;
through both private sector-led and environmentally sustainable growth and investments in&#13;
public goods and services which directly benefit the poor. The proposed project approach&#13;
supports these objectives by emphasizing poverty reduction in the poorest areas of the&#13;
country through investments in small-scale infrastructure and promotion of sustainable&#13;
natural resource management practices. Direct involvement of communities in the project&#13;
is also consistent with the objective of reducing the role of the State in productive&#13;
activities. Finally, technical assistance and technological support would strengthen public&#13;
institutions and communities, supporting the Bank's institution building objectives.&#13;
D. LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE&#13;
3.4          Past Experience. Past development efforts in Peru were highly centralized&#13;
and rarely met the real needs of the rural population. These top-down projects have been&#13;
alien to the beneficiaries, administratively complex, costly to maintain and not sustainable.&#13;
Experience from FONCODES in Peru also shows that successful development efforts tend&#13;
5  Country Assistance Strategy of the World Bank Group, October 28, 1994, Report No. 12997-PE.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
to be those administered at the local level close to the beneficiary communities.&#13;
Experience of the past twenty years in rural development indicates that effective rural&#13;
projects have been relatively small and built upon existing traditional social structures, and&#13;
have been designed, formulated and executed with considerable beneficiary participation.&#13;
They have sufficiently taken into account the role of women in the household and&#13;
community, and integrated women in project development and implementation.&#13;
3.5          Lessons in Natural Resources Management in Peru. Among the&#13;
lessons learned in soil conservation in Peru are the following: (i) there is an inverse&#13;
relationship between farm size and the implementation of soil conservation measures--the&#13;
smaller the property the higher the incentive to apply soil conservation; (ii) soil&#13;
conservation measures have a higher positive impact on productivity than agricultural&#13;
inputs, but soil conservation without improved agronomic techniques have low economic&#13;
returns; (iii) irrigation projects need to be complemented by technical assistance in&#13;
organization, water distribution and agricultural practices; (iv) participation of&#13;
beneficiaries in identification, design, implementation and maintenance of all soil&#13;
conservation works is a necessary condition for project success; and (v) payment of&#13;
salaries to communities for carrying out works for their own benefit discourages the&#13;
practice of communal works and the traditional organization of the people and is a&#13;
disincentive for future communal operation and maintenance activities.&#13;
3.6          FONCODES. The lessons learned through experiences of FONCODES&#13;
and other funds in Peru indicate the importance of: (i) transparent and well-defined&#13;
subproject eligibility and evaluation criteria to speed up the implementation process;&#13;
(ii) targeting mechanisms based on poverty data to reach the poor; (iii) promotional&#13;
activities and technical assistance to stimulate a demand-driven approach among the&#13;
poorer communities; and (iv) the degree of community participation, including women and&#13;
indigenous groups, and decentralized implementation of projects.&#13;
3.7          Regional Experience in Demand-Driven Development. A recent Bank&#13;
Review of demand-driven development funds in Latin America6 revealed that, first, by&#13;
encouraging the active involvement of community groups, the projects were much more&#13;
likely to meet the community's needs than if they were chosen to reflect the priorities of a&#13;
government agency. Second, once the communities developed a sense of ownership of a&#13;
project, they were more willing and interested in sharing in its costs and ensuring its&#13;
maintenance. Third, when a community group was given responsibility for implementing a&#13;
project that it had helped to choose and prepare, it had greater interest in ensuring that&#13;
private contractors executed the project well and honestly.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
3.8         Demand driven projects have potentially conflicting objectives7. These are:&#13;
(i) poverty targeting versus economic imperatives; (ii) demand driven subprojects versus&#13;
feasibility and sustainability; (iii) efficiency and accountability versus poverty targeting.&#13;
The project would resolve these conflicts as follows:&#13;
(a)   Poverty Targeting and Economic Imperatives. The project would only be&#13;
active in those micro-catchments which are poor, but have physical&#13;
potential to improve the natural resource base in a sustainable way. The&#13;
productive potential in each micro-catchment would be studied by the&#13;
National Institute for Natural Resources - INRENA. The sustainability of&#13;
the subprojects would be assured by the beneficiaries' commitment to&#13;
operate and maintain the subprojects in which they have invested significant&#13;
time and effort in the investment period. Moreover, operation and&#13;
maintenance of the projects is part of agricultural work during land&#13;
preparation and harvest.&#13;
(b)   Demand-driven and Feasibility. To avoid non-economic subprojects&#13;
PRONAMACHCS has worked out a technical strategy. It would not only&#13;
examine the technical feasibility of the subproject, but also its integration&#13;
into a natural resources management strategy in the micro-catchment. This&#13;
would avoid the financing of subprojects on a stand alone basis which may&#13;
be uneconomic and cause environmental damage, if not properly&#13;
integrated. Moreover, communities would only be able to benefit up to a&#13;
financial ceiling per family, and maximum project support amounts per ha&#13;
or per investment would be introduced. This would avoid the financing of&#13;
overdimensioned subprojects and increase the probability that subprojects&#13;
would be economic. The significant contribution in unpaid labor by the&#13;
communities would encourage them to choose the most cost efficient type&#13;
of investments. The project monitoring unit would include cost efficiency&#13;
indicators to measure the effectiveness of this strategy.&#13;
(c)   Accountability and Poverty Targeting. The low skills of communities in&#13;
handling procurement and disbursement would be resolved by double&#13;
signature investment accounts of PRONAMACHCS with the beneficiary&#13;
community. Where communities lack the minimum management skills, the&#13;
local branch of PRONAMACHCS would continue to provide assistance&#13;
with local procurement. Moreover, the project would provide training to&#13;
communities in the management of their investment accounts and input&#13;
revolving system. The Government is also considering to provide&#13;
additional working capital to PRONAMACHCS in the amount of&#13;
US$2 million which would be used to prefinance procurement in&#13;
beneficiary communities.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
E. ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES&#13;
3.9         Peru's main environmental problems include the general degradation of its&#13;
natural resource base because of a rapidly growing population, poverty, regional migration&#13;
and terrorism. Poorly managed irrigation schemes, modernization and expansion of&#13;
agriculture, industrialization, intensive mining and fishing add to the problems. Inadequate&#13;
institutions for enforcing property rights, inability to implement existing environmental&#13;
legislation, erratic swings in public policy, and fiscal difficulties impede a quick solution of&#13;
these problems. In the Sierra, deforestation is almost complete. The Eastern slopes have&#13;
lost 60 percent of their forest cover. Slash and burn agriculture, abandonment of over one&#13;
million hectares of Inca terraces and overgrazing have left half of Peru's surface area with&#13;
moderate to serious erosion. Small mining operations create river pollution. Poor&#13;
management of commercially oriented irrigation systems on the coast has lowered yields&#13;
and led to the salinization of one third of the area under cultivation.&#13;
3.10        The Giovernment does not require environmental impact studies of&#13;
projects. There is no Narional Environmental Action Plan. Nevertheless, in 1990 the&#13;
Peruvian Congress enacted the Environment Law which still needs to be implemented.&#13;
The law establishes a National Environmental System which is not yet operating. A&#13;
National Environmental Council (Consejo Nacional delMedio Ambiente--CONAM) has&#13;
also been established. The Government also created the National Institute of National&#13;
Resources (INRENA) within the Ministry of Agriculture. INRENA carries out&#13;
assessment of environmental and natural renewable resources, monitoring and control of&#13;
activities in which environmental risk is evident and establishment of effluent standards for&#13;
agricultural activities.&#13;
F. INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AND POVERTY&#13;
3.11        The indigenous population, defined by individuals that speak only&#13;
Quechua, Aymara and other indigenous languages, represent about 11.3 percent of the&#13;
total population. Peru is a mestizo country, however, and this definition understates the&#13;
share of the indigenous population by not counting individuals that speak both Spanish&#13;
and an indigenous language. The indigenous population mostly resides in the Sierra and&#13;
the Selva. The indigenous people of the Sierra (called campesinos) live in close&#13;
attachment to their natural resources, have their own customary social and political&#13;
institutions and live primarily from subsistence-oriented production. They do not always&#13;
identify themselves as a distinct cultural group because the word "indigenous" has a&#13;
negative connotation in Peru.&#13;
3.12        According to a 1991 household survey8, 80 percent of the non-Spanish&#13;
speaking households are poor and 55 percent are extremely poor--they are 1.3 times more&#13;
likely to be poor than the rural Spanish-speaking population. Their educational attainment&#13;
and unemployment are higher, they have less access to public services such as running&#13;
water, sewerage and electricity, and infant mortality is more than double. Significant gains&#13;

were made during the past administration in the establishment of indigenous land reserves&#13;
and other legislation protecting indigenous peoples.&#13;
3.13         The Government has an indigenous development policy. The main aspects&#13;
of this policy are contained in the Ley General de las Comunidades Campesinas, Ley de&#13;
Deslinde y Titulaci6n de Territorios de las Comunidades Campesinas, Ley de&#13;
Comunidades Nativas, and Reglamento de Comunidades Nativas. The Peruvian&#13;
Indigenous Institute, within MAG, is in charge of implementing this policy. It promotes&#13;
actions to improve the living conditions of the indigenous people, such as community&#13;
enterprises and small agriculture initiatives. It also ensures application of the norms and&#13;
regulations in favor of indigenous people, including registration of indigenous&#13;
communities, demarcation and titling of indigenous lands. It addresses environmental&#13;
concerns, technology transfer, linguistic development, ecotourism, a diverse ethnic and&#13;
cultural development, and carries out studies in linguistic, ethnic diversity, and poverty&#13;
issues.&#13;
4.   THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
4.1          The general project objective is to help alleviate the poverty of rural Sierra&#13;
people. Specific project objectives are to assist the poor to: (i) improve sustainable&#13;
management of natural resources through soil conservation measures and reforestation at&#13;
the micro-catchment level; (ii) increase rural production and productivity through&#13;
introduction of irrigation and improved agricultural practices; and (iii) strengthen their&#13;
rural organizations so that they can become autonomous and sustainable entities.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION, SCOPE AND STRATEGY&#13;
4.2          The project would finance: (i) demand-driven productive rural investments&#13;
in the Sierra on a grant basis matched by community labor; (ii) the participatory process by&#13;
which rural investments are identified, formulated and implemented; (iii) institutional&#13;
strengthening of rural communities; and (iv) goods, consulting services and training for&#13;
PRONAMACHCS assisting communities to carry out the above.&#13;
4.3          The project would be implemented over a period of six years in about&#13;
125 micro-catchments above 2,000 m altitude in the seven poorest administrative&#13;
departments of the Sierra. It would benefit an estimated 1,250 communities or 75,000&#13;
families. The target population would be selected amongst the poorest communities on&#13;
the basis of established rural poverty statistics within micro-catchments with potential for&#13;
productive improvement through soil conservation and rural productive infrastructure.&#13;
Rural investments would include: (i) soil conservation activities (construction of terraces,&#13;
water infiltration furrows, live barriers); (ii) small-scale irrigation; (iii) reforestation and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
agroforestry; (iv) improvement of soil conserving agronomic practices; and&#13;
(v) construction of community seed storehouses.&#13;
4.4          The project's overall strategy consists of a participative community natural&#13;
resource management and land use planning. Implementation of participatory plans at&#13;
community level would lead to natural resources management planning and&#13;
implementation at the micro-catchment level (microcuenca), involving communities,&#13;
municipalities and other representative organizations. In general, the beneficiary rural&#13;
communities will be comunidades campesinas, which are public interest organizations&#13;
with legal status. When no comunidades campesinas exist, rural associations of at least&#13;
twenty farmers' family units may be eligible for rural investments. Detailed eligibility&#13;
criteria for beneficiary communities would be included in the Project operational&#13;
manual (para 8.2).&#13;
4.5         The geographical unit for planning and implementation is the&#13;
micro-catchment. Such micro-catchment covers on average 10,000 ha for 600 families&#13;
(or ten communities). The technical strategy aims at: (i) adjusting land use to soil&#13;
characteristics; (ii) increasing production on fertile lands and, where not possible, convert&#13;
marginal and erosion-prone soils into stable agricultural soils through terracing;&#13;
(iii) opening the soil structure to maximize water infiltration through introduction of&#13;
adequate soil preparation and cultivation techniques; (iv) increasing soil cover through&#13;
agricultural and (agro) forestry practices which at the same time increase income; and&#13;
(v) optimizing water use for productive and other purposes through construction of small&#13;
irrigation schemes.&#13;
4.6         The operational strategy consists of a rural extension system, organized by&#13;
PRONAMACHCS, which would help the communities prepare and implement the rural&#13;
investments, and finance the rural investment costs (contractors, materials, tools, inputs)&#13;
with the proceeds of the project. The communities would contribute in unpaid labor. The&#13;
project would train the rural communities to foster self management.&#13;
C. PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
4.7         The project has four components: (i) participative identification and&#13;
formulation of rural investments in micro-catchments; (ii) rural investments;&#13;
(iii) strengthening of rural community institutions; and (iv) logistical support and training&#13;
to the implementing agency (PRONAMACHCS).&#13;
L. Participatory Identification and Formulation of Rural Investments&#13;
(Costs US$466,000)&#13;
4.8         This component aims to promote active participation of project&#13;
beneficiaries in identification, planning, design and implementation of rural investments,&#13;
taking into account the potential of soil and water resources in a micro-catchment. The&#13;
project would be implemented in seven Departments: Cajamarca, Huanuco, Ancash,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Huancavelica, Junin, Ayacucho, and Apurimac. These Departments are amongst the&#13;
poorest of Peru and do not yet benefit from significant assistance in natural resources&#13;
management.&#13;
4.9         Selection of Project Area. To select the 125 micro-catchments in which&#13;
the project would intervene, PRONAMACHCS would, firsts consider all&#13;
micro-catchments of at least 1,000 ha above 2,000 m altitude with populations living in&#13;
extreme poverty and misery as defined by the Peruvian Indigenous Institute (IIP)9.&#13;
Second, INRENA would evaluate the development potential of the selected&#13;
micro-catchments. It would carry out a study in each of the retained micro-catchments to&#13;
identify the productive potential. Each study would include a summary report on land use,&#13;
land vulnerability and capabilities and a base map at a 1/25,000 scale covering topography,&#13;
water resources, roads, and population.&#13;
4.10         The order of priority in which the micro-catchment would be assisted&#13;
would depend on the interest of the population in natural resources management and the&#13;
degree in which other institutions are involved in overlapping activities. Project&#13;
involvement during the first project year would also be determined by the proximity of the&#13;
micro-catchments to PRONAMACHCS offices.&#13;
4.11        The project would finance land use and capability studies for about&#13;
125 micro-catchments including the purchase of satellite imagery, recruitment of&#13;
specialized agencies (INRENA), computer equipment and software.&#13;
4.12        Participatory Planning. Participatory planning of project-financed&#13;
activities in the selected micro-catchmnents would take place in seven steps.&#13;
Step 1: A PRONAMACHCS extension agent would contact the local authorities and the&#13;
communities living in the micro-catchment to explain the program objectives,&#13;
procedures, the intervention methodology and commitments the communities&#13;
and PRONAMACHCS would have to make.&#13;
Step 2: After approval by the community Assembly to participate in the program, a&#13;
committee selected by the Assembly would, jointly with the extension agent,&#13;
work out a chronogram of participatory planning activities (the Participation&#13;
Agreement).&#13;
Step 3: Participatory Diagnostic. The committee would carry out a diagnostic of the&#13;
community situation and the natural resources following the rapid rural appraisal&#13;
methodology and would also involve all institutions active in the&#13;
micro-catchment. The main output of the diagnostic would include a sketch of&#13;
the micro-catchment indicating the actual and potential use of natural resources&#13;
9 This definition corresponds to the classification by FONCODES at the district level. IlIP's&#13;
classification is more detailed and considers the communities in the district.&#13;

in the catchment, an assessment of the social situation, and an evaluation of the&#13;
community institutions.&#13;
Step 4: Participatory Planning. During this rapid rural appraisal process the committee&#13;
would elaborate a communal natural resources management development&#13;
program which could include soil conservation measures, small-scale irrigation,&#13;
forestry and agroforestry, agricultural practices, technical assistance and&#13;
extension, seed storage warehouses, and strengthening of the community&#13;
institutions. This program would be discussed and agreed upon by the whole&#13;
community Assembly. The committee would then proceed with the&#13;
prioritization of activities and establish an implementation program, chronogram&#13;
and budget which includes the participation of the community. This final plan&#13;
would then be submitted again to the whole community for final approval.&#13;
Following this approval, PRONAMACHCS and the community would sign an&#13;
agreement (the Subproject Agreement) containing the first year program and the&#13;
commitments of both parties.&#13;
Step 5: Implementation of the first year program.&#13;
Step 6: Monitoring and Evaluation. Periodic meetings between the committee and the&#13;
extension agent would take place to discuss the program implementation and&#13;
correct mishaps. The agent would write brief quarterly reports on program&#13;
implementation for every community. A standard activity monitoring sheet&#13;
would be included in PRONAMACHCS' monitoring system.&#13;
Step 7: The planning for the second and following years would follow first year&#13;
implementation. The same planning procedures as mentioned in steps 4, 5 and 6&#13;
would be followed.&#13;
4.13        To carry out participatory planning in 125 micro-catchments the project&#13;
would finance PRONAMACHCS' incremental operating costs, including incremental&#13;
staff, office supplies and expenditures related to the organization of field workshops.&#13;
II. Rural Investments (Costs US$77.4 million)&#13;
4.14        The project would finance works, materials and tools, agricultural inputs,&#13;
and consulting services to prepare and implement primarily five types of rural investments:&#13;
(i) soil conservation works; (ii) small-scale irrigation; (iii) reforestation and agroforestry;&#13;
(iv) introduction of improved production technology; and (v) community seed storage&#13;
warehouses. Full technical details of the rural investments are included in Annex 1.&#13;
(a)   Soil Conservation Works would include construction and rehabilitation of&#13;
soil terraces, water infiltration furrows, and live erosion barriers as well as&#13;
agricultural inputs to increase working capital for farming activities. It is&#13;
estimated that the project would help to put 27,000 ha of marginal land&#13;
into production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
(b)   Small-Scale Irrigation Structures would include the construction and&#13;
rehabilitation of irrigation canals, water reservoirs for productive and&#13;
human water consumption, irrigation and livestock, pressure irrigation,&#13;
river bank protection structures and small dams. Total area to be put under&#13;
irrigation would be about 10,000 ha.&#13;
(c)   Reforestation and Agroforestry would include the installation of&#13;
540 communal tree nurseries, production of 20 million seedlings, planting&#13;
of 17 million trees and maintenance of 2,600 ha of communal (agro)&#13;
forests.&#13;
(d)   Improved Production Technology would include the introduction of&#13;
improved seeds and pastures as well as cultivation techniques such as&#13;
contour plowing and planting to reduce soil erosion and increase yields.&#13;
Improved technologies would be introduced in three selected&#13;
micro-catchments. The introduction of these techniques would be&#13;
validated through intense monitoring and spread through contests between&#13;
communities, demonstration fields, study tours and other extension&#13;
techniques.&#13;
(e)    Community Seed Storage Warehouises: 430 warehouses would be&#13;
constructed.&#13;
(f)    Preparation Studies and Consulting Services for non-standardized&#13;
investments in some particular small-scale irrigation systems and&#13;
environmental impact analyses where necessary.&#13;
Eligibility Criteria and Beneficiary Contributions&#13;
4.15         The above investments would be eligible for financing under the project if:&#13;
(i) they are included in the Participation Agreement between the community and&#13;
PRONAMACHCS as described in para. 4.12; (ii) they benefit the community as a whole;&#13;
(iii) the cost of total project contributions (in materials, tools, equipment, agricultural&#13;
inputs and skilled labor) in a single community does not exceed US$100,000 per&#13;
investment type (soil conservation, irrigation and forestry) over the project period with an&#13;
overall maximum of US$ 1,000 per family; and (iv) the value of community contribution in&#13;
unpaid labor for the total investments in each community is at least 20 percent.&#13;
4.16         This project focuses on small investments, carried out by the beneficiaries,&#13;
and it aims to achieve a minimum financial return of ten percent on these investments.&#13;
Project financial analysis has determined that the expected benefits of particular&#13;
investments will not justify unit inputs exceeding a certain amount to be applied as a&#13;
financial ceiling for project contributionsl0. Thus the contribution in the form of materials&#13;
for the construction of absorption terraces would not exceed US$750 per ha, for slow&#13;
formation terraces US$375 per ha and for water infiltration US$150 per ha. In irrigation,&#13;
the project contribution per ha would not exceed US$1,500. Project contributions to&#13;
10 Investments exceeding these ceilings have a lower return.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15&#13;
communal tree nurseries would not exceed US$400 per nursery, to tree planting&#13;
US$230 per ha and maintenance US$540 per 10 ha. The project contribution to&#13;
warehouses would not exceed US$3,500 per unit.&#13;

(a)   To be reviewed during mid-tern review&#13;
4.17        The eligibility criteria and beneficiary contributions would be contained in&#13;
the project operational manual. They would be reviewed on the basis of the project&#13;
monitoring and evaluation. The preparation of a project operational manual&#13;
including eligibility criteria and beneficiary contributions --all acceptable to the&#13;
Bank-- before loan effectiveness has been agreed upon during negotiations&#13;
(para. 8.2).&#13;
m. Institutional Strengthening of Community Organizations (Costs US$3.6 million)&#13;
4.18        This component would finance training and technical assistance by&#13;
PRONAMACHCS and Non-Governmental Organizations to rural communities: (i) in&#13;
participatory planning; (ii) to establish 50 micro-catchment management committees which&#13;
would design and implement participatory soil conservation plans; and (iii) in financial&#13;
management so that they are able to manage an investment account and a small in-kind&#13;
revolving stock for agricultural inputs.&#13;
4.19        The project would finance the following activities.&#13;
(a)   Participatory planning promotion through: (i) the production of&#13;
30 different bilingual pamphlets on participatory planning and community&#13;
strengthening to be distributed in the communities; (ii) radio broadcasts to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
promote participation; and (iii) 125 courses in participatory planning at the&#13;
micro-catchment level.&#13;
(b)   Establishment of 50 natural resources management committees at the&#13;
micro-catchment level through financing of 125 annual seminars,&#13;
1,250 workshops at the community level and 40 courses in&#13;
micro-catchment natural resources management.&#13;
(c)   Financial management courses to train 1,250 communities in the&#13;
management of their investment account and agricultural input revolving&#13;
stock in 250 courses.&#13;
(d)   Small enterprise management courses in 625 communities which show&#13;
most potential to benefit from these courses.&#13;
4.20        In addition, the project would finance 1,250 small initiatives for the&#13;
exclusive benefit of rural women. Each initiative would not exceed US$1,500 per&#13;
community. They would include community projects in small livestock, wood&#13;
conservation stoves, medicinal plants, food processing, and gardening. For each project,&#13;
the beneficiaries would participate for at least 20 percent of the cost.&#13;
IV. Project Operation, Management, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
(Costs US$11.7 million)&#13;
4.21        To improve PRONAMACHCS' management capacity and enable smooth&#13;
project implementation, this component would: (i) introduce a coherent management&#13;
information system as well as a project monitoring system; (ii) train PRONAMACHCS&#13;
staff in management and natural resources conservation techniques; and (iii) complement&#13;
Government financing for the administration of PRONAMACHCS.&#13;
4.22        PRONAMACHCS' three cumbersome management information systems&#13;
would be integrated and simplified. The existing information systems do not provide&#13;
sufficient financial data to allow efficient monitoring of subproject costs and impact. To&#13;
overcome these deficiencies the project would finance management information and&#13;
monitoring consultants, software and computer equipment.&#13;
4.23        To improve PRONAMACHCS' technical capacity, the project would&#13;
finance training for professional and managerial staff. This training would include:&#13;
(i) management courses in Peru; (ii) managerial seminars and workshops for mid-level&#13;
managers; (iii) technical and environmental analysis training for extension staff,&#13;
(iv) national and departmental workshops; (v) study trips to learn about natural resources&#13;
management experiences in the region; and (vi) short term international consultants to&#13;
provide advice in specialized fields.&#13;
4.24        The project would also strengthen the departmental and branch offices and&#13;
finance: (i) 20 vehicles, 200 motorcycles, 20 sets of office equipment, 100 incremental&#13;
fixed-term extension staff and incremental operational costs for 20 PRONAMACHCS&#13;
branches within the project area; (ii) 7 sets of audiovisual and data processing equipment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
and 7 community institution building promoters at the Departmental level; (iii) two&#13;
incremental staff to improve the accounting, control and management information system&#13;
at PRONAMACHCS; (iv) consultants to monitor and evaluate the impact of project&#13;
activities (including consultants for IIP); and (v) independent financial auditors.&#13;
Relationship with FONCODES II Project&#13;
4.25        FONCODES and PRONAMACHCS have worked out a formal agreement&#13;
on April 22, 1996 to divide responsibilities for an efficient implementation of subprojects&#13;
and avoid overlaps. The agreement provides that FONCODES would orient its&#13;
productive rural investments to those sectors which are complementary to&#13;
PRONAMACHCS' core program, as defined in the agreement. To avoid inconsistency in&#13;
approach, FONCODES would finance projects such as implemented by&#13;
PRONAMACHCS under the same conditions and eligibility criteria, and not remunerate&#13;
unskilled labor for those types of subprojects which are also financed by&#13;
PRONAMACHCS.&#13;
4.26        PRONAMACHCS would: (i) analyze the demand for rural investments in&#13;
a participatory way; (ii) prepare the technical dossiers for FONCODES subprojects in soil&#13;
conservation, small scale irrigation and reforestation projects in those areas where both&#13;
institutions intervene; (iii) participate with the beneficiaries in the implementation of&#13;
FONCODES subprojects as works supervisor; (iv) provide technical assistance to&#13;
FONCODES; (v) enhance the sustainability of FONCODES subprojects which fall under&#13;
the agreement; and (vi) provide a priority program to be financed by FONCODES while&#13;
PRONAMACHCS is awaiting the availability of project funds.&#13;

5. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
A. PROJECT COSTS&#13;
5.1         Total project costs are estimated at US$93.2 million including taxes and&#13;
duties. Base costs are US$81 million and contingencies are US$12.2 million (15 percent).&#13;
Taxes and duties are estimated at US$7.2 million. The foreign exchange component is&#13;
US$20.2 million, or 22 percent of project costs. Project costs are estimated at March&#13;
1996 prices. The breakdown of costs by component is shown in Table 3. Detailed cost&#13;
tables are presented in Annex 5. Physical contingencies are estimated at five percent of&#13;
investment costs. Price contingencies (averaging ten percent of base costs) were&#13;
calculated on the basis of the following domestic and international inflation rates.&#13;

B. PROPOSED FINANCING PLAN&#13;
5.2         The Bank would finance about 55 percent of project costs. These would&#13;
consist mainly of works, goods (materials, tools and agricultural inputs) and equipment.&#13;
Government would finance the incremental recurrent costs of PRONAMACHCS&#13;
(15 percent) and parts of goods, inputs, equipment, training and technical assistance. The&#13;
farmers would contribute about 30 percent of the project costs in unpaid labor.&#13;

C. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR GOVERNMENT&#13;
5.3         Government would contribute approximately US$14.3 million towards the&#13;
project. This contribution includes the costs of all farmer field training programs&#13;
(US$465,000), a percentage of all investment costs which covers taxes and duties&#13;
(US$7.2 million), recruitment (on a fixed-term basis) of 100 additional extension agents&#13;
and 7 departmental promoters, and about 50 percent of PRONAMACHCS' incremental&#13;
operating costs. This amount would add approximately 15 percent to the&#13;
PRONAMACHCS annual operation budget of US$15 million during the project period.&#13;
D. PROCUREMENT&#13;
5.4         The table below summarizes the project elements, with cost estimates, and&#13;
proposed procurement methods. All procurement under the project would be carried out&#13;
in accordance with Bank guidelines dated January 1995.&#13;

5.5           The Bank would finance: (i) civil works, tools, materials, equipment and&#13;
agricultural inputs for rural investments; (ii) vehicles and office equipment for&#13;
PRONAMACHCS; (iii) training; (iv) consulting services; and (v) non-salary incremental&#13;
operating costs. During negotiations, it has been agreed that PRONAMACHCS&#13;
would use Bank standard bidding documents for International Competitive Bidding&#13;
procurement and bidding documents acceptable to the Bank for National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (para. 8.1).&#13;
5.6          Procurement would be carried out by PRONAMACHCS and rural&#13;
communities under the guidance of PRONAMACHCS, which would be strengthened by a&#13;
local consultant, a specialist in Bank procedures. PRONAMACHCS employs an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
administrative officer in charge of procurement in every branch office who would train&#13;
community leaders in purchasing tools, equipment, agricultural inputs at the local level&#13;
through shopping. PRONAMACHCS has gained experience in Bank procurement&#13;
through the management of a Japanese Grant. It has been agreed during negotiations that,&#13;
prior to the issuance of any invitations to prequalify for bidding or to bid for contracts,&#13;
PRONAMACHCS would forward a project procurement plan to the Bank for its review.&#13;
Procurement of all goods and works shall be undertaken in accordance with the Bank&#13;
approved procurement plan. The procurement plan would be included in the project&#13;
operational manual (para 8.2).&#13;
Civil Works, Tools, Materials and Equipment for Rural Communities&#13;
5.7         Procurement for community-based civil works, tools, materials, agricultural&#13;
inputs and equipment totaling US$49.5 million (US$43.2 million of which would be&#13;
financed by the Bank) would follow practices in accordance with PRONAMACHCS'&#13;
operational guidelines which are acceptable to the Bank. Procurement for&#13;
community based projects would be done by the communities themselves with technical&#13;
assistance of PRONAMACHCS. Works under the project are small works not exceeding&#13;
US$100,000 per subproject and are scattered over the seven Departments. Therefore, all&#13;
works would be procured under lump sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of&#13;
quotations obtained from at least three qualified domestic contractors in response to a&#13;
written invitation. Goods for communities (including tools, materials, agricultural inputs&#13;
and equipment) costing US$50,000 or less per contract and up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$34.1 million would be procured through national shopping at the local level. Goods&#13;
and agricultural inputs for communities not available at the local level and costing less than&#13;
US$200,000 per contract may be procured by PRONAMACHCS at the departmental&#13;
level up to an aggregate amount of US$6.8 million through National Competitive Bidding.&#13;
5.8         Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs) acceptable to the Bank would be&#13;
used for National Competitive Bidding (NCB) and these SBDs would be included in the&#13;
project operational manual (para 8.2).&#13;
Goods and Equipment for PRONAMACHICS&#13;
5.9         PRONAMACHCS would purchase vehicles, motorcycles and computer&#13;
equipment for an amount of US$1.6 million equivalent, US$1.4 million of which would be&#13;
financed by the loan. Procurement of vehicles and motorcycles would be done through&#13;
International Competitive Bidding. Procurement of computer equipment, not exceeding&#13;
US$50,000 per contract, up to the aggregate amount of US$400,000, will be done&#13;
through international shopping among suppliers with established service and maintenance&#13;
facilities in Peru.&#13;
Consulting Services&#13;
5.10        Consulting Services under the project would amount to US$1 million&#13;
(US$0.9 million of which would be financed by the Bank). The services consist of:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
(i) consulting assignments for individuals and firms providing direct technical assistance&#13;
and consulting services to INRENA, IIP and PRONAMACHCS in the baseline studies&#13;
and monitoring; and (ii) technical assistance services, training, and studies by individuals,&#13;
NGOs or firms to rural communities. Consulting and management services would be&#13;
procured in accordance with the 1981 Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. All&#13;
assignments would be small and straightforward. PRONAMACHCS would recruit&#13;
individual consultants from a shortlist of at least three candidates for each post. A sample&#13;
letter of invitation, award criteria and a sample contract, all acceptable to the Bank,&#13;
would be included in the Project operational manual (para. 8.2).&#13;
5.11        Review Procedures. Although the prior review arrangements described&#13;
below will result in a relatively low level of prior review by the Bank, this is acceptable in&#13;
light of the large size of the sample of projects which will be subject to ongoing review&#13;
under the auditing arrangements described in paragraph 5.13.&#13;
5.12        Review of Procurement by PRONAMACHCS. The Bank would&#13;
conduct a prior review of: (i) each contract for vehicles; (ii) the first two contracts for&#13;
other goods costing more than US$100,000; (iii) all procurement for goods exceeding&#13;
US$200,000 per contract; (iv) consultant selection documentation (terms of reference,&#13;
shortlists, contract, etc.) for consulting services directly recruited by PRONAMACHCS&#13;
with an estimated contract amount of US$100,000 or more for firms and US$50,000 or&#13;
more for individuals; (v) terms of reference for all consulting services contracts; and&#13;
(vi) all consultants contracts based on a single source or of a critical nature.&#13;
5.13        Review of Procurement by Communities. Bank officials would carry&#13;
out a post-review of procurement by communities on a small sample basis during&#13;
supervision. PRONAMACHCS would recruit auditors who would not only examine&#13;
financial implementation but also procurement procedures and physical implementation in&#13;
the field. These auditors would carry out six-monthly audits on the basis of a sample not&#13;
lower than 60 percent of the Bank-financed investments in the first project year, 50&#13;
percent in the second and 40 percent in the last years. Terms of reference of these&#13;
auditors, acceptable to the Bank, would be included in the Operational Manual&#13;
(para 8.2).&#13;
E. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
5.14        The Bank loan of US$51 million is expected to be disbursed over a period&#13;
of 6.5 years, beginning the third quarter of FY97 through the end of the second quarter of&#13;
FY2003. The project completion date would be December 31, 2002 and the closing date&#13;
would be June 30, 2003. The disbursement schedule is presented in Annex 6. The&#13;
disbursement pace is similar to the historical disbursement profile for agricultural projects&#13;
in Peru. The disbursement pace would depend on the quality of subproject preparation&#13;
and PRONAMACHCS's administrative capacities. PRONAMACHCS would be&#13;
strengthened by a specialist in Bank disbursement procedures. Employment of a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
disbursement specialist by PRONAMACHCS before March 31, 1997 has been&#13;
agreed upon during negotiations (para 8.1).&#13;
5.15         Rural investments would include civil works, skilled labor, goods, tools,&#13;
materials and equipment for eligible beneficiaries. Training includes the cost of the&#13;
trainers' and trainees' fees, rental of training facilities, per diem of trainees and materials&#13;
required for the training activities. Consulting services include contracts to carry out:&#13;
(i) training; (ii) technical assistance including by NGOs; (iii) follow-up on participatory&#13;
planning; (iv) cartographical services; (v) pre-investment studies and (vi) accounting,&#13;
control and management information studies. Incremental operating expenditures include&#13;
expenditures for travel, office rental, office materials and supplies, utilities, office and&#13;
equipment maintenance, field materials and per diems. The term agricultural inputs means&#13;
seeds, fertilizers and a positive list of chemicals to be included in the project&#13;
operational manual (para 8.2).&#13;

5.17        Documentation of Expenditures. Disbursements would be made on the&#13;
basis of full documentation for all expenditures made under contracts requiring prior Bank&#13;
review and amendments to contracts raising the value of such contracts above the prior&#13;
review limits. These contracts are: (i) all contracts for vehicles, the first two contracts for&#13;
goods exceeding US$100,000 and all contracts exceeding US$200,000; and (ii) consultant&#13;
service contracts directly procured by PRONAMACHCS with an estimated contract&#13;
amount of US$100,000 or more for firms and US$50,000 or more for individuals. For all&#13;
other expenditures disbursements would be made against Statements of Expenditure&#13;
(SOE) for which supporting documents would be maintained by PRONAMACHCS and&#13;
would be available for Bank staff review. Because of the large volume of disbursements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
expected to be claimed under SOEs, special efforts would be made for the selective review&#13;
of SOE documentation by visiting Bank missions and auditors.&#13;

&gt;US$50,000 for individuals&#13;
5.18        Special Account. A Special Account in US dollars would be opened at a&#13;
commercial bank in Peru. The account would have an authorized allocation of&#13;
US$3 million and would cover four months of project expenditures. The authorized&#13;
allocation would be limited to US$1 million until the withdrawals have reached&#13;
US$5 million. Withdrawals from the Special Account would be done by&#13;
PRONAMACHCS. The Bank would replenish the Special Account for the amount of&#13;
withdrawals on account of eligible expenditures at the request of the Borrower.&#13;
5.19        Project Account. PRONAMACHCS would create a subproject financing&#13;
fund or project account of US$2 million equivalent, which would allow it to put small&#13;
advances into community bank accounts and to be used to purchase tools and materials&#13;
purchases at the local level. Eligible expenditures would be reimbursed to the project&#13;
account through the Special Account.&#13;
5.20        Retroactive Financing. Reimbursement of up to US$5 million would be&#13;
permitted for eligible expenditures made in accordance with procurement procedures&#13;
agreed under the project from July 1, 1996, provided that the loan is signed not later than&#13;
July 1, 1997. If the loan is signed at a later date, the initial date for eligibility of&#13;
expenditures for retroactive financing would be modified so that the period covered by&#13;
retroactive financing would be no more than one year. Retroactive financing is&#13;
recommended to ensure that the selection and studies of micro-catchments, the&#13;
participative planning of the demand for soil conservation investments and bulk&#13;
procurement can go ahead before project effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
F. AUDITING AND ACCOUNTS&#13;
5.21        PRONAMACHCS would maintain separate accounts for project&#13;
expenditures as well as a register of assets purchased with project funds. The present&#13;
accounting system has been analyzed and found to be adequate. It needs now to be&#13;
enhanced to include the project accounts. The accounting plan would be included in&#13;
the project implementation manual (para 8.2). PRONAMACHCS would hire&#13;
independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank to audit on an annual basis the financial&#13;
statements, the Special Account and SOEs. In addition the auditors would prepare a&#13;
(long-form) report on project management. Copies of the audited statements would be&#13;
sent to the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year. With respect to SOEs, the&#13;
auditor's reports would include an opinion (and comments and recommendations, as&#13;
necessary) on the methods employed in compiling the SOEs, their accuracy, the relevance&#13;
of supporting documents, their eligibility for financing under terms of the loan agreement,&#13;
the standards of record keeping and intemal controls related to the foregoing. Terms of&#13;
reference of the auditors would be included in the project operational manual&#13;
(para 8.2).&#13;
6. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. PROJECT MANAGEMENT&#13;
6.1         The project would be carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture through&#13;
PRONAMACHCS which would be strengthened by two local consultants, specialists in&#13;
Bank procurement and disbursements working within the Planning and Administration&#13;
Departments. Twenty branches would be involved in the project"1. The branches, now&#13;
only containing soil conservation specialists, would be strengthened by incorporating&#13;
promoters and agriculturists.&#13;
6.2         PRONAMACHCS has an executive director assisted by an administrative&#13;
and financial office, a planning office, a legal and an internal audit office. There are three&#13;
technical directorates: soil conservation, reforestation and infrastructure. At the regional&#13;
level there are 16 departments and 66 branches.&#13;
6.3         The planning office would be responsible for preparing the annual&#13;
operational plan and the internal monitoring and evaluation of the activities financed under&#13;
the project. The administrative office would be responsible for the project accounting and&#13;
disbursements. PRONAMACHCS is familiar with procedures of international institutions.&#13;
The procurement officer and financial manager of PRONAMACHCS have received&#13;
training in Bank disbursement procedures and would undergo Bank procurement training.&#13;
1 The list of branches is in Annex 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
6.4         Seven departments would be involved in project implementation.&#13;
PRONAMACHCS central structure is also reflected at the departmental level.&#13;
Considering the multiplicity of training and community institutional strengthening activities&#13;
under the project, seven specialist promoters would be recruited to coordinate and support&#13;
the training activities. Recruitment by PRONAMACHCS of one specialist in&#13;
promotion and organization of rural communities per department before March 31,&#13;
1997 has been agreed upon during negotiations (para 8.1). Terms of reference of the&#13;
specialists would be included in the Project operational manual (para 8.2).&#13;
6.5         Each of the branches involved in the project would have three specialists&#13;
responsible for coordination, planning, training and supervision. This team would consist&#13;
of a soil conservation engineer, an agricultural engineer, and a forestry specialist.&#13;
Specialists in the promotion and organization of rural communities would be recruited&#13;
when activities in this sector require it. The team would be strengthened by one&#13;
agronomist for each five extension agents.&#13;
6.6         At the micro-catchment level the branches have one extension agent per&#13;
five communities. This would allow the extension agent to spend one day per week per&#13;
community and undergo regular training. The extension agent would be trained in all&#13;
PRONAMACHCS activities through an intensive technical training program. About&#13;
100 fixed-term extension agents would be recruited under the project.&#13;

B. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
6.7         Implementation Plan. The overall project implementation plan is in&#13;
Annex 8 and includes a detailed first year implementation plan. During the lead-in period&#13;
of the project, PRONAMACHCS and INRENA would carry out the studies on the&#13;
micro-catchments and the branches would carry out the participatory planning sessions&#13;
for the first project year. The micro-catchments (79) for the first year have been&#13;
identified. The general plan of action is to start in 1996 with the 300 communities already&#13;
working with PRONAMACHCS and to gradually add 400 communities in 1997, and 550&#13;
in 1998.&#13;
6.8         The pace of the rural investments has been estimated on the basis of&#13;
PRONAMACHCS' implementation experience. Although the institution has the capacity&#13;
to drastically increase its activities, implementation of rural investments has been hindered&#13;
by lack of funds. The implementation plan, however, provides for a gradual increase in&#13;
PRONAMACHCS activity. The project would be carried out in accordance with the&#13;
implementation plan including a detailed first year implementation plan, annual&#13;
revisions of the plan to be made by PRONAMACHCS and to be submitted to the&#13;
Bank for review (para. 8.1).&#13;
C. PROJECT MONITORING AND SUPERVISION&#13;
6.9         The project would be monitored by: (i) PRONAMACHCS' monitoring&#13;
and evaluation unit; (ii) the MAG project coordinating unit; (iii) IIP; (iv) Bank supervision&#13;
missions; and (v) external audits.&#13;
6.10        PRONAMACHCS would set up.an in-house monitoring and evaluation&#13;
unit which would collect qualitative data on participatory planning, physical and financial&#13;
data on rural investments and their impact on poverty and development, data on progress&#13;
in institutional strengthening of the communities and efficiency data on&#13;
PRONAMACHCS' management and operation. PRONAMACHCS would be&#13;
strengthened by a project monitoring specialist. Employment of the monitoring&#13;
specialist by PRONAMACHCS before March 31, 1997 has been agreed upon during&#13;
negotiations (para 8.1). Terms of reference of the specialist would be included in the&#13;
Project operational manual (para 8.2).&#13;
6.11        The monitoring indicators would be divided into: (i) project activity&#13;
progress indicators; (ii) result indicators; and (iii) project impact indicators. Project&#13;
activity indicators include measurements of progress in procurement, recruitment of staff,&#13;
studies, training programs, disbursements, the number of rural investments approved,&#13;
under implementation and implemented, hectares of terraces built and under irrigation, the&#13;
number micro-catchment committees formed, etc. Result indicators would include&#13;
production and yield increases, areas with agro-forestry protection, participation of&#13;
women, efficiency of the community organizations, and increased management capacity of&#13;
PRONAMACHCS. Impact indicators would measure the development impact on&#13;
revenue, improvements in local diet, sustainability of the works, entrepreneurial activities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
and the local organizations. A list of monitoring indicators is presented in Annex 8&#13;
and would be included in the project operational manual (para. 8.2).&#13;
6.12        The MAG project coordinating unit would monitor the project through&#13;
regular progress reports. IIP would carry out yearly evaluations in ten percent of the&#13;
communities to measure project impact on indigenous people.&#13;
6.13        The Bank would monitor and supervise the project through six-monthly&#13;
progress reports and two supervision missions per year, in which the Borrower would&#13;
participate. These supervision missions would cover project progress in: (i) participatory&#13;
planning; (ii) physical implementation; (iii) community strengthening; and (iv) operation&#13;
and monitoring. They would also review compliance of procurement and disbursement&#13;
procedures and statements of expenditure. The supervision plan is in Annex 8.&#13;
6.14        Project Launching Workshop. At the outset of the project, Government&#13;
would organize a project launching workshop. The Government would invite&#13;
representatives of all institutions involved, possible partners in project implementation and&#13;
farmers organizations and explain the project objectives, methodology and field of action.&#13;
The workshop would also cover (for a more limited public) procurement, disbursements&#13;
and project monitoring aspects.&#13;
6.15        Mid-Term Review. Thirty months after loan effectiveness, the Bank and&#13;
the Government would jointly carry out a mid-term review (MTR) (para 8.1). The&#13;
review would cover progress in the physical project achievements and community&#13;
strengthening on the basis of the project monitoring indicators. In particular the MTR&#13;
would look at: (i) the necessity to expand the eligible investments into artesanal&#13;
agricultural processing related activities; (ii) the impact of the improved technology&#13;
activities in the five selected micro-catchments; (iii) the need for reallocation of funds;&#13;
(iv) the eligibility criteria and beneficiary contributions; and (iv) the development impact.&#13;
6.16        Implementation Completion Report (ICR). Not later than six months&#13;
after the project closing date, the Government and the Bank would carry out a joint&#13;
project completion review and produce an Implementation Completion Report. Following&#13;
this review, the Government would present to the Bank a plan for the future operation of&#13;
the project, furnish the plan to the Bank for comments, and carry out the plan taking into&#13;
account the Bank's comments thereon.&#13;
7. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL EVALUATION&#13;
A. METHODOLOGY&#13;
7.1         A financial and economic analysis has been carried out for the rural&#13;
investment component and for the project as a whole. The underlying analysis is based on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
a financial analysis for the rural investment component completed during project&#13;
preparation 2. The financial analysis has been adjusted to account for economic prices and&#13;
transfer payments to arrive at an economic analysis. Overall project financial and&#13;
economic analysis has been prepared by building models based on the component analysis&#13;
and detailed costs estimated for the overall project. A detailed description of these&#13;
analyses is provided in Annex 7. The methodologies, assumptions, and results are&#13;
summarized below.&#13;
7.2          Under the rural investments component, subprojects would be implemented&#13;
in a variety of agroecological zones throughout the Sierra, where sub-regions have&#13;
significantly different climates due to varying altitudes. Additionally, individual&#13;
subprojects would be financed largely as the result of a demand-driven, community&#13;
participatory process.&#13;
7.3          Rather than conducting financial and economic analysis for a set of&#13;
pre-defined specific subprojects, several types of subprojects have been analyzed to define&#13;
economically viable investment parameters. These subproject types have been selected on&#13;
the basis of PRONAMACHCS implementation experience. They are indicative not only&#13;
of subprojects expected to be implemented under the project but also of sub-regions in the&#13;
Sierra where they are likely to be carried out.&#13;
7.4          The analysis has been done on the basis of 12 farm models which are&#13;
representative of the principle agroecological zones in the Sierra. The models focus&#13;
primarily on crop development since data on grazing and other activities are scarce and the&#13;
project is oriented towards agricultural improvements. For each subproject, farm models&#13;
represent farm families who benefit primarily from improvements in soil and water&#13;
management. Increased production value results from reducing losses due to soil erosion,&#13;
increasing irrigated areas while maintaining relatively constant cropping patterns, and&#13;
reducing seed or crop losses due to poor storage capacity.&#13;
7.5          For each model, with and without project scenarios have been analyzed on&#13;
a per ha basis. This yields an incremental benefit per hectare which serves as the basis for&#13;
estimating benefits resulting from each subproject type. In general, benefits have been&#13;
estimated for a period of twenty years considering that the type of subprojects envisioned&#13;
under the project are of a long term investment nature and several years may pass before&#13;
tangible benefits are realized. With these benefit flows, using discount rates of 8, 10, and&#13;
12 percent, (acceptable levels of) investment cost parameters have been estimated on a per&#13;
hectare basis. These parameters serve as the basis for the investment limits defined in&#13;
paras. 4.15-16 above. These limits are generally at or below PRONAMACHCS average&#13;
subproject investment costs.&#13;
12 Detailed studies were conducted by a team of international and local consultants. Under FAO and&#13;
Bank supervision, the results of these studies were later adjusted during project pre-appraisal. The&#13;
studies and adjusted results are located in the Project Files.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
B. RURAL INVESTMENT COMPONENT&#13;
7.6          Financial Analysis. Using the above methodology, a financial rate of&#13;
return for the rural investment component has been estimated. Additionally, the financial&#13;
impact of subprojects on beneficiary families has been estimated. The assumptions and&#13;
results for this financial analysis are the following:&#13;
7.7          Assumptions for the financial analysis are: (a) commodity prices are based&#13;
on farmgate prices for the Sierra; (b) only agricultural activities are taken into&#13;
consideration; (c) the cost of unskilled labor is estimated at five soles per day;&#13;
(d) maintenance costs are estimated at three percent of investment costs; (e) taxes and&#13;
duties are included; and (f) physical contingencies are estimated at five percent of&#13;
investment costs.&#13;
7.8          The financial impact analysis for beneficiary families also assumes that:&#13;
(a) inputs provided under the subprojects are treated as short term in-kind loans without&#13;
financial cost; (b) tools provided under the subprojects are treated as donations,&#13;
(c) unskilled labor is an in-kind contribution provided by beneficiaries during the&#13;
non-farming season; and (d) income taxes on beneficiaries are not included since families&#13;
at the poverty level found under the project are typically exempt from these taxes.&#13;
7.9          The results show that the subprojects are financially viable. Without&#13;
maintenance costs, all subprojects show average financial internal rates of return at&#13;
12 percent or better, except for subprojects with just agronomic improvement activities&#13;
(where the return is estimated at ten percent). The financial return for the overall&#13;
component is estimated at just over 11 percent. Factoring in maintenance costs, the&#13;
returns for subprojects generally fall by two to three percent and the return for the overall&#13;
component falls to ten percent. However, the financial impact of subprojects on&#13;
beneficiary families can be measured not only in terms of financial returns but also in terms&#13;
of the value of inputs and tools ("incentives") received. This can range from about&#13;
US$10 to US$50 per family for each subproject. Combined with the aforementioned&#13;
subproject financial returns, this translates into incremental income per family of about&#13;
US$60 to US$250 for each subproject. While the incremental income is spread over&#13;
several years, for families with annual incomes of less than US$1,000, it can have a&#13;
significant impact, especially since families often participate in more than one subproject&#13;
during a given year.&#13;
7.10         Economic Analysis. The economic analysis for the component has been&#13;
carried out using the same methodology applied for the financial analysis. However,&#13;
several adjustments have been made to convert, where applicable, financial prices into&#13;
economic prices and to account for transfer payments.&#13;
7.11         The same assumptions used for the financial analysis have been used for&#13;
the economic analysis, except: (a) economic prices have been estimated for international&#13;
commodities such as wheat and corn; (b) the economic opportunity cost of unskilled labor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
is estimated at three soles per day (or 60 percent of the financial wage cost); and (c) taxes&#13;
and duties for investments are excluded.&#13;
7.12         The results show that economic returns improve significantly relative to&#13;
financial returns, primarily due to the reduced cost of unskilled labor assumed in the&#13;
economic model, as well as the reduction of taxes and subsidies. The unskilled labor is a&#13;
weighty factor, particularly in soil conservation subprojects. The economic internal rate of&#13;
return is higher than the financial internal rate of return by over five points. Economic&#13;
returns for the other subprojects generally improve by about two to three points above&#13;
financial returns, although for subprojects such as warehouses, where there is relatively&#13;
little unskilled labor involved, the economic and financial returns are about the same. For&#13;
the overall component, the economic return is 14 percent, about 4 points higher than the&#13;
financial return, after factoring in maintenance costs. Additionally, there are several&#13;
positive externalities which, while difficult to quantify, would also yield significant&#13;
benefits. These include: reduced urban migration, reduced soil erosion downstream in the&#13;
more commercial lower watershed areas, enhanced security and pacification in rural areas,&#13;
and enhanced solidarity and social cohesion among rural communities.&#13;
C. PROJECT ANALYSIS&#13;
7.13         Building on the above financial and economic evaluation, and taking into&#13;
consideration project investment costs, financial and economic analysis for the overall&#13;
project has been carried out. The assumptions underlying the component analysis remain&#13;
the same for the overall project analysis. The principle differences are: (a) costs for&#13;
additional components planned under the project are incorporated into the financial model,&#13;
and (b) for the economic model, these same additional costs are largely excluded since&#13;
associated benefits are non-quantifiable and thus the economic value can not be&#13;
incorporated in the benefit stream.&#13;
7.14         Financial Analysis. After adding in additional costs for institutional&#13;
strengthening, training, and logistical support to PRONAMACHCS, the financial internal&#13;
rate of return for the overall project naturally falls by a couple of points. However, the&#13;
return remains reasonable at eight percent, still at or above Government's cost of capital,&#13;
and arguably an acceptable rate of return for any project oriented towards poverty&#13;
alleviation in the Sierra.&#13;
7.15         Economic Analysis. The economic internal rate of return for the overall&#13;
project is 12 percent. This is again a function of the value of unskilled labor and transfer&#13;
payments factors described above, as well as the exclusion of additional component costs&#13;
whose benefits can not be quantified. The economic return for the overall project does&#13;
not take into consideration the significant positive externalities described above.&#13;
D. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS&#13;
7.16         Sensitivity analysis has been carried out for the rural investment component&#13;
and overall project financial and economic analyses. Changes in investment costs and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
benefits have been tested to determine the impact of such shifts on the internal rate of&#13;
return (IRR). Changes of specific line item costs have also been tested, particularly those&#13;
that are weighty in the financial and economic models, such as unskilled labor.&#13;
7.17         The results show that the IRR is sensitive to movements in the overall&#13;
investment costs and benefits, as well as the cost of unskilled labor. This is also a function&#13;
of the timing of investments and benefits, where costs are heavily front-loaded and benefits&#13;
more back-loaded. A ten percent shift in costs or benefits yields more than a one percent&#13;
shift in the IRR. A ten percent shift in unskilled labor cost yields nearly a one-half percent&#13;
shift in the return rate. Investment costs, including for unskilled labor, can and should be&#13;
monitored closely to ensure they do not overly exceed investment limits established by the&#13;
above analysis. At the same time, since benefits have been estimated conservatively (they&#13;
neither include benefits from grazing and other non-farm activities, nor externalities), there&#13;
is little concern that these will shift significantly in the wrong direction.&#13;
E. BENEFITS&#13;
7.18         It is estimated that the project would ultimately benefit about 75,000 poor&#13;
families in about 1,250 communities throughout the Sierra. These families are very poor&#13;
or extremely poor, maintaining subsistence lifestyles on an average of one half or one&#13;
hectare of marginally cultivable land. Incomes are typically less than US$1,000 per family&#13;
and opportunities for alternative livelihoods are few.&#13;
7.19         As noted, subprojects are financially beneficial, with returns generally at or&#13;
above 12 percent. These returns combined with in-kind assistance to subprojects yield&#13;
incremental income per family of about US$60 to US$250 for each subproject. The IERR&#13;
does not take into account major externalities which include: (i) reduced urban migration,&#13;
(ii) reduced soil erosion downstream in the more commercial lower watershed areas,&#13;
(iii) enhanced security and pacification in rural areas, and (iv) enhanced solidarity and&#13;
social cohesion among rural communities. While these externalities are difficult to&#13;
quantify, anecdotal evidence suggests that their economic value is significant. For&#13;
example, it is estimated that PRONAMACHCS projects have helped generate about&#13;
30,000 jobs per year and reduce destruction of some 75,000 ha of cultivable coastal land&#13;
in five years. Even using conservative estimates of the economic value of such benefits,&#13;
the savings to society are in the tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars.&#13;
F. RIsKs&#13;
7.20         The major risks in this project are as follows. The first risk is that&#13;
communities insufficiently participate. This can be caused by PRONAMACHCS staff&#13;
imposing on communities to carry out non-economic rural investments or by a lack of free&#13;
labor in the communities. This risk would be mitigated by the requirement to have&#13;
participative planning agreements with the communities before disbursement of project&#13;
proceeds, courses in participative planning and a ceiling to the total investment amount per&#13;
family. This would reduce incentives to choose non-economic activities and take on more&#13;
activities than the community can carry out. The monitoring system would provide data&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
on subproject implementation, including community labor participation. The second risk&#13;
is that soil conservation works would not be followed by improved agronomic practices.&#13;
This would reduce the economic profitability of the project. This risk would be mitigated&#13;
by providing the communities with extension services and agricultural inputs on a grant&#13;
basis for the first year. The community would also receive training to learn how to&#13;
manage a revolving system by which the inputs can be yearly replaced. The third risk&#13;
would be the lack of funding for PRONAMACHCS. In the past, shortages of funds have&#13;
hampered PRONAMACHCS' investment activities, but not its operation. The additional&#13;
project-related expenditures would be included in the Government's annual budget. This&#13;
is already the case for the 1997 estimated expenditures. The risk of shortages of&#13;
counterpart funds would be further mitigated through an ongoing dialogue between the&#13;
Bank and the Ministry of Economy and Finance on the adequate provision of counterpart&#13;
funds to Bank-financed projects.&#13;
G. GENDER ISSUES&#13;
7.21        Women carry out major parts of the work in the Andes. They do not&#13;
participate sufficiently, however, in the decision making at the community level and in&#13;
training. To improve participation by women PRONAMACHCS would: (i) encourage&#13;
rural community committees to integrate women so that at least ten percent of the&#13;
committee members are women; (ii) recruit more female extension agents so that&#13;
20 percent of the extension agents in the project area would be women by the end of the&#13;
project; (iii) schedule training programs to involve more women so that every year at least&#13;
20 percent of the project training beneficiaries are women; and (iv) carry out 1,250&#13;
specific project activities aimed at increasing the revenues of women and improving soil&#13;
conservation. These actions would be closely monitored during implementation.&#13;
H. INDIGENOUS PEOPLE&#13;
7.22        All project beneficiaries can be categorized as indigenous people of the&#13;
Andes. The project activities fit within the strategy of the Peruvian Indigenous Institute&#13;
which aims at involving the traditional communities in development activities.&#13;
A pre-appraisal beneficiary assessment to involve indigenous people in project design has&#13;
been carried out. Participatory planning during implementation would continuously&#13;
involve indigenous people in the decision-making process. This would be monitored by&#13;
IIP. The Government's land registration campaign also ensures that indigenous people&#13;
can register titles to their lands. Moreover PRONAMACHCS would finance language&#13;
training for non-quechua speaking extension agents and translation of project manuals in&#13;
Quechua. IIP would also participate in project impact and monitoring studies to ensure&#13;
that indigenous people effectively participate in decision-making and benefit from the&#13;
project.&#13;
7.23        The activities carried out under the project would fully comply with the&#13;
Bank's Operational Directive on indigenous peoples (OD 4.20) for the following reasons.&#13;
Indigenous people have been involved in the project design through a beneficiary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
assessment. The Ministry of Agriculture has the social, technical and legal skills to carry&#13;
out the project. The implementation arrangements would involve the local communities&#13;
(comunidades campesinas) in the preparation and implementation of the rural investments.&#13;
Local customs (such as community labor) would be widely used during implementation.&#13;
The development activities financed under the project would support, revive and try to&#13;
improve the ancient production technologies and techniques used by these communities&#13;
during centuries. The project would include training in management skills for indigenous&#13;
people to avoid over-dependency on PRONAMACHCS. A pilot program in three&#13;
micro-catchments would try to improve certain traditional agronomic practices of the&#13;
indigenous population. Finally, as part of an effort to comply with OD 4.20 para&#13;
15 (a) and (c), an additional assessment of the legal status of the campesinos and&#13;
their communities - as reflected in the country's constitution, legislation and&#13;
subsidiary legislation--and their ability to obtain access to and effectively use the&#13;
legal system would be carried out before March 31, 1997 and an action plan in&#13;
agreement with the Bank would be prepared before June 30, 1997 to implement the&#13;
study's recommendations in connection with the project (para 8.1). The assessment&#13;
would also include the land tenure rights of the communities. Draft terms of reference of&#13;
the study are in Annex 10.&#13;
I. ENVIRONMENT&#13;
7.24        The project would have long term beneficial environmental effects on water&#13;
and soil resources at the micro-catchment level. These beneficial effects include soil and&#13;
water conservation, reduced sedimentation in streams and improvements in water quality.&#13;
The project would also reduce sedimentation to the coastal river basins, thereby reducing&#13;
inputs of nutrients from fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides to downstream areas.&#13;
A positive list of chemicals to be financed under the project would be established and&#13;
included in the operational manual. The integration of environmental considerations into&#13;
the construction and operation of small irrigation projects and other off-farm activities at&#13;
community levels would mitigate some localized negative environmental impact. Since&#13;
there would be numerous subprojects implemented within the micro-catchments, the&#13;
overall project would provide cumulative beneficial effects on water quality and&#13;
environmental quality. PRONAMACHCS staff would also be trained in environmental&#13;
analysis and mitigation. The mitigation and enhancement measures suggested in Annex 9&#13;
should ensure the attainment of the benefits. These mitigation measures would be&#13;
included in the project operational manual in the form of an environmental&#13;
checklist (para 8.2).&#13;
J. POVERTY ALLEVIATION&#13;
7.25        The chief objective of the project is to increase rural household incomes&#13;
and alleviate poverty through sound and sustainable natural resources management,&#13;
irrigation and forestry. The micro-catchments selected under the project are almost all&#13;
situated in the higher Sierra areas where possibilities for productive development without&#13;
outside assistance are rare. In Peru, geography is the indicator with the greatest value as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
targeting mechanism: by directing resources to the rural Sierra, one in every two&#13;
extremely poor households in the country can be reached. 3 The beneficiary communities&#13;
would be selected on the basis of poverty criteria. All project beneficiaries are categorized&#13;
as poor, and many are extremely poor. Improved natural resources management would&#13;
increase their production and revenue over time and increase food security.&#13;
8. AGREEMENTS&#13;
8.1          Agreements reached during negotiations:&#13;
(a)   PRONAMACHCS would use Bank standard bidding documents for&#13;
International Competitive Bidding procurement and bidding documents&#13;
acceptable to the Bank for National Competitive Bidding (para. 5.5);&#13;
(b)   PRONAMACHCS would employ a specialist in Bank disbursements before&#13;
March 31, 1997 (para 5.14);&#13;
(c)   the recruitment by PRONAMACHCS of one specialist in promotion and&#13;
organization of rural communities per department before March 31, 1997&#13;
(para 6.4);&#13;
(d)   the project would be carried out in accordance with the implementation&#13;
plan including a detailed first year implementation plan, annual revisions of&#13;
the plan to be submitted to the Bank for review (para 6.8);&#13;
(e)   the recruitment by PRONAMACHCS of a project monitoring specialist&#13;
before March 31, 1997 (para 6.10);&#13;
(f)   the project monitoring and supervision arrangements including the content&#13;
of the Mid-Term Review (para 6.15); and&#13;
(g)   the carrying out of a legal assessment of the indigenous peoples rights&#13;
before March 31, 1997 and preparing an action plan before June 30, 1997&#13;
(para 7.23).&#13;
8.2          As a condition of loan effectiveness, PRONAMACHCS will approve the&#13;
project operational manual. Such manual to contain procurement procedures and&#13;
bidding documents; sample letters for invitation and procedures for evaluation of&#13;
consulting services; standard terms of reference for consultants; a procurement&#13;
plan; selection and eligibility criteria for micro-catchments; eligibility criteria for&#13;

ANNEX 1&#13;
PERU&#13;
SIERRA - NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND&#13;
POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT&#13;
RURAL INVESTMENTS&#13;
A. TECHNICAL STRATEGY&#13;
1.          The predominantly semi-arid upper Sierra (above the 2,000 above sea&#13;
level) covers about 350,000 km2 and can be divided in three agroecological zones:&#13;
(i) valley bottoms - characterized by slopes under 12 percent, deep, fertile soils, abundant&#13;
surface water and smooth temperatures; (ii) steeplands - characterized by steep slopes&#13;
(average 25-30 percent), shallow soils, limited access to irrigation water, and temperatures&#13;
varying from smooth in the lower parts to cold and windy in the upper slopes; and&#13;
(iii) high plateaus (above the 4,000 m.a.s.l. line) - characterized by a smooth topography,&#13;
poor soils, relatively abundance of water and a cold, windy climate.&#13;
2.          Valley bottoms have generally been developed into intensively cropped,&#13;
irrigated oasis, with relatively minor soil management problems. They cover about five&#13;
percent of the Sierra. Steeplands, covering about 75 percent of the land, are characterized&#13;
by extensive, severely eroded and poorly managed rainfed cropping areas. In sites with&#13;
better soils and favorable water-access conditions, terrace systems have been constructed&#13;
since Inca times, for the establishment of more stable, irrigated farming patterns. Terraced&#13;
areas cover about one million ha (0.3 percent of the Sierra), many of them abandoned and&#13;
others severely degraded. High plateaus (20 percent of the area) are used mainly for&#13;
extensive grazing and are too cold for crops.&#13;
3.          The most significant types of natural resource degradation in the Sierra&#13;
include severe soil deterioration associated with continuous soil losses, nutrient and&#13;
organic matter depletion, gully formation and increased downstream river silting, caused&#13;
by water-induced soil erosion and uncontrolled water runoff during the rainy season,&#13;
resulting from extensive removal of the natural vegetation, inadequate land use and poor&#13;
soil management. This is compounded by uncontrollable natural erosion mainly in the&#13;
sparsely vegetated slopes of the steepest Andean areas. Wind erosion is far less&#13;
significant.&#13;
4.          Water-induced erosion starts when the bare soil is exposed to erosive&#13;
rainfall. The impact of rain seals the surface (rainsplash effect). Rain which cannot&#13;
infiltrate is lost as surface runoff, carrying away more soil particles and causing sheet an&#13;
gully erosion damages, silting of river beds and flooding. To prevent water-induced soil&#13;
erosion, a land management strategy must achieve three objectives: (a) minimize&#13;
rainsplash effect by protecting the soil surface; (b) minimize excess runoff by maximizing&#13;
the amount of infiltration; and (c) minimize water runoffs ability to flow and form gullies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
by limiting its accumulation and velocity. A series of land/water management and soil&#13;
conservation techniques are used.&#13;
5.           The first step is to adjust land use to land suitability. In the Sierra, where&#13;
most land is technically inappropriate for crops due to the steep slopes, fanning suitability&#13;
usually needs to be generated by upgrading unsuitable to suitable soils, through terracing&#13;
and irrigation. On slopes not exceeding 12 degrees, soil conservation can be achieved&#13;
through agronomic practices. Above this gradient, however, physical barriers against&#13;
erosion are required. In the Sierra, construction of terraces, contour trenches and live&#13;
barriers will constitute the leading strategy. In any circumstance, the strategy will be&#13;
oriented to maximizing production from the best land and minimizing the use of marginal&#13;
land, which translates into developing areas with high potential soils, and designing poor&#13;
soils for reforestation and livestock. In areas where the average slope is below the&#13;
10-12 percent line, the project would introduce an expanded, comprehensive land&#13;
management strategy, with stress on agronomic practices.&#13;
6.           To minimize rainsplash effect and excess runoff, farmers would rely on&#13;
reduced- or no-tillage techniques, associated with deep ripping, contour cropping, soil&#13;
amendments, and raising nutrient and organic matter levels, to stimulate crop biomass&#13;
production and productivity; crop diversification and cropping rotations to include green&#13;
manure crops, selected seeds, intensified crop density and optimal use of crop residues;&#13;
windbreaks to reduce surface evaporation; adequate pasture and herd management; and&#13;
use of low-cost vegetative contour barriers with fodder crops or other erosion-control&#13;
plants. Generally these practices result in quick improvements in yields and attractive&#13;
financial returns.&#13;
7.           Water harvesting is an additional objective to be considered as a means to&#13;
prevent runoff and soil sliding and store irrigation water for the dry spells. Since the&#13;
handling of excessive runoff implies a collectively agreed control plan, the success of the&#13;
technical strategy would depend on the involvement of all land users within a&#13;
micro-catchment.&#13;
8.           In areas unsuitable for improvement, reforestation will be encouraged, both&#13;
for conservation and exploitation purposes. The project's technical strategy is based on&#13;
land and water management practices detailed in the Technical Manual to be prepared by&#13;
PRONAMACHCS. Some of these technologies are readily available for diffusion; others&#13;
need to be adapted before being transferred to the farmers.&#13;
B. PROJECT INVESTMENTS&#13;
1.    Soil Conservation Infrastructure Works&#13;
9.           Soil conservation structures create a stable agroecological environment for&#13;
sustainable farming in the Sierra and constitutes the project's central strategy. Three main&#13;
types of structures are envisaged: bench terraces, slow-formation terraces and infiltration&#13;
furrows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
(a)    Bench Terraces or Absorption Terraces (Terrazas de Absorci6n)&#13;
10.          Bench terraces are earth embankments constructed in a series of levels like&#13;
the steps of a stair, traversing the slopes to prevent erosion and generate suitable soil for&#13;
cropping, generally on very steep slopes. Each step is separated from the next by almost&#13;
vertical stone walls (or earth risers). Earthen risers may be stabilized with a vegetal cover,&#13;
introduced preferably with selected native brush species.&#13;
11.          Soil Conservation Impact. The construction of bench terraces upgrades&#13;
unsuitable land to first-class cropland. Bench terraces are very effective against erosion.&#13;
The deep, leveled soil accumulated in the bench efficiently absorbs rain water and prevents&#13;
runoff. Non-absorbed water is conducted to a drainage network. In addition, bench&#13;
terraces permit irrigation schemes to increase soil moisture, extend cropping periods and&#13;
expand production possibilities. Bench-terrace soils can be improved through organic&#13;
matter and fertilization, creating the basis for sustainable production systems.&#13;
12.          Targets and Costs. The project's final target over five years is to improve&#13;
about 2,350 ha of unsuitable slopes with the construction of hand constructed bench&#13;
terraces. The construction costs include labor, tools and local materials (mainly stones&#13;
and earth). Total construction cost depends essentially on the amount of labor required.&#13;
This varies with the slope, soil depth and the presence of stones. Total costs (including&#13;
labor) may vary from about SI. 4,300 to S/. 11,400 per ha, 76 percent of which accounts&#13;
for labor. The maximum cost (including labor) allowed under the project is S/. 7,000/ha,&#13;
beyond which the activity becomes economically unviable. The total cost of this activity is&#13;
estimated at US$6.8 million. The total contribution of the communities, calculated at a&#13;
S/. 5/person-day, is estimated at US$5.1 million.&#13;
(b)    Slow Formation Terraces (Terrazas de Formacion Lenta)&#13;
13.          Used generally on less pronounced slopes, slow-formation terraces (SFT)&#13;
are formed by constructing level-contour barriers with stones or earth embankments&#13;
across the slopes, to control runoff, favor water infiltration, and convey the accumulation&#13;
of runoff-carried soil. Over the years, these sediments stabilize and form smooth-graded&#13;
platforms between terraces. The efficiency of SFTs can be increased with the&#13;
establishment of vegetated contour rows along the embankments. Where soil depth&#13;
permits, live barriers associated with infiltration furrows may replace the embankments.&#13;
14.          Soil Conservation Impact. SFT constitute a low-cost, efficient&#13;
erosion-control solution for slopes under the 12 percent gradient line. Like bench&#13;
terraces, SFT favor water infiltration, allow plowing, and facilitate the use of irrigation.&#13;
However, SFT soil conservation effect is slower and stabilization usually requires a period&#13;
of 10 years or more. During the formation period, erosion is maintained within the&#13;
boundaries of each platform, controlled by the barriers. Erosion is the main formation&#13;
factor of this type of terrace. In its final stage, the gradient of the terraced slope would be&#13;
flat, and any sheet erosion can be controlled through appropriate agronomic soil&#13;
management practices and the inclusion in the system of a proper drainage network. SFT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
is an efficient long term technique for transforming soils originally unsuitable for crops&#13;
into productive, sustainable farmlands.&#13;
15.          Targets and Costs. The target is to improve a total area of about&#13;
10,000 ha with slow-formation terraces. SFTs require less labor and tools than bench&#13;
terraces. Average total costs vary between S/. 1,350 and S/. 5,080 per ha. The highest&#13;
values correspond to extreme situations in which works are spread over a period of three&#13;
to five years. In each year the barriers are lifted with a new stone layer to raise the level of&#13;
the sediment platform. PRONAMACHCS estimates average labor requirements varying&#13;
between 390 and 710 person-days, while tools requirements vary between S/. 680 and 780&#13;
per hectare. The financial analysis carried out during preparation shows that, to obtain a&#13;
profitability of ten percent, construction costs per ha must not exceed: S/. 5,400 in the&#13;
upper Sierra; S/. 3,600 in the central band; and S/. 1,300 in the lower areas. The project&#13;
would supply the required tools at an estimated total cost of US$3.5 million over five&#13;
years. Communities will contribute 4.5 million person-days, estimated at about&#13;
US$9.7 million.&#13;
(c)   Infiltration Furrows (Zanjas de Infiltraci6n)&#13;
16.         Infiltration furrows (IF) are level contour trenches crossing the slopes&#13;
controlling runoff and collecting rain water to increase infiltration and soil moisture. IFs&#13;
are constructed in the grassland areas of the upper catchments for pasture improvement or&#13;
reforestation.&#13;
17.          Soil conservation impact. The impact of IFs on local erosion is&#13;
negligible, as their command areas are generally protected by a permanent grass cover.&#13;
However, by intercepting runoff, they contribute to reduced downhill runoff volumes and&#13;
erosiveness, thus protecting downstream croplands from intensified degradation. IFs main&#13;
conservation impact, however, is increasing soil moisture. This contributes to improve&#13;
plant growth conditions in the treated areas and raise overall soil moisture and ground&#13;
water volumes at micro-catchment level, multiplying the availability of irrigation water.&#13;
18.          Targets. The project will construct IFs in a total area of about 14,800 ha.&#13;
The labor required for the construction of IFs varies, according to the slope, distance&#13;
between furrows and the depth of the trenches, from 190 to 325 person-days per ha, and&#13;
the demand for tools from S/. 350 and S/. 430 per ha. Total ha costs vary from S/. 800 to&#13;
S/. 1,500. The total cost for the construction of IFs over five years has been estimated at&#13;
US$2.6 million. Beneficiaries would contribute US$7.1 million equivalent.&#13;
2.    Agricultural Inputs&#13;
19.          To ensure higher yields and revenues from these investments and optimize&#13;
the use of conservation and irrigation works, the project would promote adoption of&#13;
simple, higher performing technological packages comprising mainly improved seeds,&#13;
fertilizers and agrochemical. These inputs will be distributed to farmers who completed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
the construction of bench terraces and slow-formation terraces as incremental working&#13;
capital to farming activities.&#13;
20.           Soil Conservation Impact. Quality seeds combined with the use of&#13;
fertilizers and proper pest control will contribute to increased crop vigor and,&#13;
consequently, to increased soil cover. Higher yields and revenues should encourage&#13;
farmers to extend and maintain their soil conservation structures.&#13;
21.           Targets and Costs. Delivery of agricultural inputs would start operating&#13;
in project-year two, after completing the first-year conservation target. The project would&#13;
assist 1,500 ha in years two and three; and 3,000 ha in years four and five. The crops to&#13;
be benefit are mainly potatoes (50 percent); maize (25 percent) and barley (25 percent).&#13;
The total cost of this component over five years is estimated at US$9 million. Per-ha&#13;
costs are as follows:&#13;
(in Soles)&#13;
Crop          Seeds   Fertilizer  Agrochemical   Total&#13;
Potatoes             2,250      800          700        3,750&#13;
Maize/barley           70       380          100          585&#13;
Average Cost            -         -            -        2,160&#13;
3.    Small-Scale Irrigation Works&#13;
22.          In the semi-arid environment of the Sierra, the use of conservation&#13;
structures can be optimized with the introduction of irrigation, reducing risks and&#13;
increasing land productivity. The project would finance construction and/or rehabilitation&#13;
of small irrigation works aimed at expanding and improving crop production efficiency.&#13;
These works include construction of small reservoirs, improvement of weirs and diversion&#13;
structures and the construction and or/lining of water distribution canals. The project&#13;
would also promote pressure irrigation by gravity, and supply the corresponding pipes and&#13;
sprinklers for its implementation. Most irrigation schemes would benefit the areas treated&#13;
with bench (absorption) terraces as well as valley bottoms with a smooth topography.&#13;
Sprinkler and drip irrigation will be promoted on slow-formation terraces.&#13;
23.           Soil conservation impact. Impact of irrigation on soil conservation is&#13;
indirect. It contributes to improve crop vigor, generating increased soil cover (to protect&#13;
it against rainsplash and wind erosion) and increased organic matter in the soil through&#13;
expanded root systems and a more voluminous aerial vegetation. This improves soil&#13;
fertility, increases yields, fosters sustainability, and provides farmers with means to&#13;
improve crop husbandry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
24.          Targets and Costs. The project would construct/rehabilitate small&#13;
irrigation works to benefit a total area of about 10,000 ha. This would include the&#13;
construction/rehabilitation of: (a) 50 water reservoirs; (b) 17 small dams; (c) 80 km of&#13;
irrigation canals; and the supply of PVC pipes, hoses and drip-irrigation gadgets, and&#13;
sprinklers. Total costs of the irrigation component are estimated at US$22.9 million.&#13;
Maximum per hectare costs with irrigation works (including labor, tools, materials and&#13;
equipment) have been estimated at US$1,500 in the upper Sierra; US$2,600 in the central&#13;
areas; and US$3,100 in the lower catchment zones. Considering the extreme diversity of&#13;
such irrigation works, the unskilled labor component is estimated at seven percent.&#13;
4.    Reforestation and Agroforestry Activities&#13;
25.          There are in the Sierra about 20 million ha of land suitable for forestry,&#13;
most of which is bare land exposed to accelerated erosion. About 350,000 ha (2.5 percent&#13;
of that area) have already been reforested over the last 15 years, part of which under the&#13;
PRONAMACHCS' soil conservation program. These forests are becoming an important&#13;
source of firewood and timber for construction materials and furniture in the Sierra.&#13;
About 15 percent of the country's sawn timber is being supplied by these forests.&#13;
However, for lack of adequate forest management knowledge, local processing facilities&#13;
and sound marketing arrangements, timber extraction is not producing the expected&#13;
returns. As reforestation is a key soil conservation factor, and the country's demand for&#13;
forest products is increasing, forestry development is an important project component. It&#13;
would include, besides the production of seedlings and establishment of forest and&#13;
agroforestry plantations, actions to improve forest management.&#13;
26.          Impact on soil conservation. Forest stands would be planted in areas not&#13;
suitable for crops, but good for forestry activities. Forest plantations will be a&#13;
complementary activity in the overall micro-catchment system. Forest stands provide a&#13;
permanent soil cover and protection against erosion. They absorb and store rain water in&#13;
the micro-catchment and reduce the impact of downhill runoff affecting croplands in lower&#13;
bands. Forests improve the soils on which they are planted, by incorporating organic&#13;
matter and nutrients extracted from the lower soil layers and deposition of leaves and&#13;
branches. Agroforestry activities include particularly: (a) windbreaks - to protect soils&#13;
against wind erosion and crops against evapotranspiration; (b) live barriers - to control&#13;
runoff and establish slow-formation terraces; and (c) alley-cropping - the establishment of&#13;
wide-spaced soil-enriching perennial trees, intercropped with annual crops. The best&#13;
adapted species for the Sierra have already been established through tests with eucalyptus,&#13;
conifer and native species.&#13;
27.          Activities and targets. The Agroforestry component, designed to address&#13;
the various phases of the activity, includes the following investments:&#13;
(a)    Tree Nurseries. Includes the establishment on farmers' land of&#13;
infrastructure for production of forest seedlings. Investment items include&#13;
fencing, preparation of seed-beds and transplanting platforms, installation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
of an irrigation system, tools, plastic bags, and labor. The project would&#13;
help establish 540 nurseries.&#13;
(b)   Seedling production. The community would, with PRONAMACHCS&#13;
assistance, carry out: preparation of seed-beds, seeding, transplanting,&#13;
watering, seedling management and selection. Nurseries would produce an&#13;
average of 10,000 seedlings per year. The project would help produce&#13;
about 20 million seedlings.&#13;
(c)    Forest establishment. The accomplished seedlings will be transplanted to&#13;
areas established by the participatory micro-catchment planning. Land&#13;
preparation previous to planting includes the construction of infiltration&#13;
furrows, pegging, and holing. Most plants will be used for agroforestry&#13;
and sylvo-pastoral activities, alternated with crops and/or pastures, through&#13;
alleys, windbreaks, live fences and vegetated barriers. The remaining&#13;
seedlings will be planted for conservation and economic exploitation. The&#13;
project would help establish an equivalent of 17,000 ha of forest (trees).&#13;
(d)   Forest management. Aimed at ensuring plant survival, it includes: pest&#13;
control, protection against damages by domestic animals and cattle,&#13;
pruning, thinning, regrowth management, etc., spread along the forest cycle&#13;
up to maturity.&#13;
28.          Costs. The component's total cost is estimated at US$11.9 million. The&#13;
project would finance all requirements for tools, materials, seeds and other inputs, at a&#13;
total cost estimated at US$6.9 million, or about 60 percent of the component's total costs.&#13;
The communities will supply about 160,000 person days of voluntary labor, rated at a&#13;
total cost of about US$3.4 million), or 40 percent of forestry total costs.&#13;
5.    Seed and Input Storage Rooms&#13;
29.          Construction of small community storage rooms is an efficient complement&#13;
to soil conservation investments and has contributed to the sustainability of the farmers&#13;
production systems. They are extremely useful for storage of seeds, their maintenance in&#13;
good planting condition, and the upkeep of inputs and crop products. The construction of&#13;
storage houses is recommended when the quantity of inputs and products exceeds&#13;
20 metric tons. They are semi-rustic structures with a very simple design, and constructed&#13;
mainly with community labor, using local materials (lumber, bricks, tiles). The project&#13;
would finance the complementary construction materials, tools, and the qualified labor.&#13;
30.          Soil conservation impact. Well preserved quality seeds will contribute to&#13;
produce vigorous crops end ensure good soil cover, protecting soils against erosion,&#13;
favoring infiltration and incorporation of increased organic matter in the soil. The&#13;
resulting economic gains through reduced risks and increased average yields and revenues&#13;
are expected to motivate farmers to adopt improved soil management practices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
31.         Targets and Costs. The project would finance construction of 430 small&#13;
storage houses with an average capacity of 25 m.t. The average unit cost is estimated at&#13;
S/. 11,742, which includes: qualified labor; construction materials (S/. 5,300); tools&#13;
(S/.315); and 750 person-days of unskilled labor. The project would finance&#13;
US$1.6 million. The communities would supply labor, estimated at US$800,000.&#13;
C. INTENSIVE-MANAGEMENT PILOT MICRO-CATCHMENTS&#13;
32.         Introduction. While bench terracing has been successful for upgrading&#13;
originally unsuitable soils to productive farmland, and slow-formation terraces have been&#13;
introduced by PRONAMACHCS as an efficient low-cost solution for reducing average&#13;
slopes, no comprehensive strategy has yet been developed to prevent soil degradation in&#13;
these terraces and ensure its sustainability on the long run.&#13;
33.         The difficulty of ensuring soil cover after harvest is a major constraint.&#13;
Crop residues are eaten by animals and fallow growth is constrained by lack of moisture.&#13;
This leaves soils exposed to splash erosion at the first rains of the subsequent season.&#13;
Erosion combined with damage by animals and lack of maintenance have degraded most&#13;
old terrace systems, and caused low productivity and abandonment. To prevent&#13;
degradation, improved soil management practices, not yet systematically tested, need to be&#13;
introduced. They include, particularly, adequate soil preparation, fertilizing and manuring,&#13;
adoption of efficient irrigation-water distribution, use of ecological band-specific crop&#13;
varieties, proper crop densities, and soil conservation effective rotations.&#13;
34.         Project Action. To trigger the process of introducing an amplified soil&#13;
management strategy in the Sierra, extrapolating the current conventional approach which&#13;
concentrates on the construction of physical structures, the project would introduce an&#13;
extended, intensified soil management strategy in three pilot micro-catchments to be&#13;
defined at appraisal. These micro-catchments are to be selected on the basis of their&#13;
agroecological representatives, communities' willingness to participate, and dynamism of&#13;
the local PRONAMACHCS technical teams. In these pilot micro-catchments, the&#13;
integrated land management strategy will be tested in full.&#13;
35.         Participatory planning will follow the same overall methodology adopted&#13;
by the project. In addition to the conventional strategy (terracing, reforestation,&#13;
irrigation), project implementation could put particular emphasis on: (a) introduction of&#13;
improved agronomic, zootechnical and agroforestry practices in both terraced and&#13;
non-terraced areas; (b) adaptive research in soil management technologies; (c) water&#13;
monitoring to determine project impact on water flows and transport of soil sediments;&#13;
(d) realignment and maintenance of feeder roads to neutralize road-born erosion impacts;&#13;
and (e) socioeconomic monitoring to determine impact on production and revenues.&#13;
36.         Implementation Arrangements. Research and monitoring activities will&#13;
be carried out through agreements with relevant public or private specialized institutions&#13;
such as INIA, INRENA, Universities, etc. Two pilot micro-catchments would be started&#13;
in PY1 and the third in PY3.&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
PERU&#13;
SIERRA - NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND&#13;
POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT&#13;
RuRAL COMMUNITY STRENGTHENING&#13;
1.          During project preparation the Government has carried out a beneficiary&#13;
assessment in 144 communities located in 30 micro-catchments of eight departments. This&#13;
annex provides a summary of the conclusions of this assessment and describes the&#13;
community strengthening component. The full report is included in the working paper.&#13;
A.    BENEFICIARY ASSESSMENT CONCLUSIONS&#13;
Profile of the Target Communities&#13;
2.           Most peasant communities in the Sierra are basically groups of families&#13;
living in a territory where property rights are vested in the extended family. Decisions are&#13;
generally taken in a communal assembly and are carried out by community authorities or&#13;
elected community boards. Peasant communities have legal recognition and are legal&#13;
entities before the law. 14&#13;
3.           Women. According to some estimations women are responsible for&#13;
60 percent of agricultural activities. They are usually unaware of their rights and usually&#13;
do not participate in management positions within their own communities. Women have&#13;
made important labor contributions to PRONAMACHCS activities.&#13;
4.           Land Tenure. There are two types of land ownership. Family plots are&#13;
exploited without obligation of a contribution to the community. More than 50 percent of&#13;
the families own around two hectares of land. Community lands are collectively used by&#13;
the whole community under three modalities: (;) natural pastures for the use of all&#13;
"comuneros" for livestock purposes; (ii) community agricultural land for common benefit;&#13;
(iii) miscellaneous and non cultivated lands (eriazas) including forest lands.&#13;
Community Organizations&#13;
5.           Community peasant organizations are stable, long term organizations that&#13;
enjoy credibility and respect among peasants and its characteristics offer several&#13;
advantages for project sustainability. Community organizations in the Sierra evolve&#13;
14  Peru Political Constitution recognizes these communities and their ownership of communal land;&#13;
Civil Code, according to Decree of July 24, 1984 protects their legal status; Law 24656 of Peasant&#13;
Communities declares them of national interest to support their development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
around land ownership and cultural traditions. Top authority lays with the General&#13;
Assembly where the main decisions are taken; a board of managers integrate a "Junta&#13;
Directiva" including a President, a Vice-President, a Treasurer, Deputy and a Supervisor;&#13;
this organization also incorporates municipal authorities related to the political structure of&#13;
the country such as the "Teniente Gobernador" and the "Agente Municipal'. All&#13;
members are elected democratically in a general assembly attended not only by all&#13;
"comuneros" but by their families, including young people and children. Traditional&#13;
organizations have proven to respond to requirements of different public and private&#13;
programs. The community creates special committees of elected members in charge of&#13;
each particular program; such as: conservation, irrigation, water and electricity&#13;
committees.&#13;
6.          Community Enterprises (Empresas Comunales) have been promoted&#13;
according to a model provided by MAG. In the last three years more than 700 such&#13;
"empresas" have been developed but not all are functioning successfully. According to&#13;
the beneficiary assessment, many peasants participation in empresas comunales has been&#13;
out of interest in obtaining public funds rather than just the advantages of incorporating a&#13;
modem entrepreneurial management.&#13;
Community Willingness to Participate and to Provide Labor&#13;
7.          An important aspect of the beneficiary assessment was to identify potential&#13;
beneficiaries' willingness to participate in the project; this was measured through&#13;
participation levels in PRONAMACHCS activities. Almost 95 percent of peasants&#13;
interviewed found the activities very useful for their communities because of the soil&#13;
conservation impact. Seventy percent of peasants confirmed that most works were&#13;
finished and operating. These works have contributed to recover solidarity and mutual&#13;
support rooted in community traditions. Thirty percent mention subprojects with some&#13;
level of difficulty; mainly because of conflicts within the community itself&#13;
8.          To promote participation PRONAMACHCS has provided four types of&#13;
incentives: (i) tools; (ii) seeds and fertilizers; (iii) training; (iv) and eventually, food&#13;
support. These incentives are a key factor for ensuring community participation.&#13;
Ninety-five percent agreed with the PRONAMACHCS approach, mainly because of the&#13;
provision of agricultural inputs and tools (35 percent), although an important group&#13;
considered soil conservation, tree nurseries and training also very important. Twenty&#13;
percent mentioned that they would not participate without incentives. Seventeen percent&#13;
would not be interested if they did not receive food.&#13;
9.          The decision on labor commitment are taken by the community assembly.&#13;
Each committee establishes its own work program deciding on specific days and times to&#13;
carry out different tasks as well as sanctions when members fail to accomplish their&#13;
obligations. Penalties include payment of fines and/or additional labor contributions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
10.         Each family contributes, on average, 48 days of free labor per year. When&#13;
benefits of conservation are better understood, the yearly contribution can raise to&#13;
144 days per family. On average, 50 percent of families in each community participate in&#13;
PRONAMACHCS work. The departments with higher number of indigenous population&#13;
are also the ones with higher rates of participation because of their cultural tradition of&#13;
free labor contributions (minka).&#13;
Community Participation and Training&#13;
11.         Participation is the key element to achieve all project's objectives.&#13;
Participation is necessary to: (i) implement a participatory planning system and undertake&#13;
investments that respond to community priorities; (ii) carry out conservation activities&#13;
requiring organized participation of communities; (iii) set up a natural resources&#13;
management system based on the introduction of participatory research programs; and&#13;
(iv) transform community organizations into a more business management oriented&#13;
organization.&#13;
12.         Training was one of the main requests of communities during the&#13;
consultation process. Technical training provided by PRONAMACHCS concerns&#13;
conservation works, maintenance and operation of rural infrastructure. Sixty percent&#13;
expressed their satisfaction with this effort; however, they also requested a more&#13;
aggressive and systematic training program. Peasants expressed their doubts about the&#13;
effectiveness of training of "community promoters" and insisted on the need of direct&#13;
training through the extension agents to major groups. Twenty-one percent agreed with&#13;
the advantages of promoters training and 25 percent preferred a combination of both&#13;
training methods. The use of the local language was suggested by 18 percent of peasants.&#13;
Moreover, 36 percent mentioned the need for more practical than theoretical courses.&#13;
B.  COMMUNITY STRENGTHENING COMPONENT&#13;
13.         Objectives. The project would include a component to enhance&#13;
community participation, increase awareness of advantages of conservation and better&#13;
community organization. The component's objectives would be to: (i) make communities&#13;
conscious of the need of preserve natural resources and promote their participation in&#13;
PRONAMACHCS conservation activities; (ii) promote creation of micro-catchment&#13;
management committees to increase conservation impact; (ii) strengthen the managerial&#13;
capacity of peasants community organizations; and (iv) enhance women participation.&#13;
14.         Strategy. To achieve these objectives four action lines have been&#13;
considered: (i) promotion and participatory planning; (ii) micro-catchment management&#13;
committees; (iii) strengthening managerial capacity of community organization; and&#13;
(iv) support to women participation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
1. Promotion and Participatory Planning&#13;
15.         This action builds on the PRONAMACHCS experience of community&#13;
work but promotes a more organized participation of communities. Two activities would&#13;
be implemented: a promotion campaign and participatory planning.&#13;
16.         Promotion. A yearly promotion campaign woi.ld take place to incremse&#13;
participation and disseminate results. This would include:&#13;
(a) preparation of bilingual pamphlets: a set of 30 pamphlets per community&#13;
would be prepared relating to: (i) the participatory approach of the project; (ii) the need&#13;
to improve community organization; and (iii) free labor contributions; and&#13;
(b) radio broadcasts would be organized in each branch to respond to local&#13;
conditions and interest, languages and education and cultural levels.&#13;
17.         A participatory planning process would be implemented to ensure&#13;
community participation in all stages of the project according to the following cycle:&#13;
(a)   initial approach of PRONAMACHCS with community authorities to&#13;
explain project objectives, procedures and conditions;&#13;
(b)   agreement to participate by community assembly and designation of special&#13;
committee members;&#13;
(c)   each community, with the support of the PRONAMACHCS extension&#13;
agents would: (i) identify the community's potential and needs;&#13;
(ii) diagnose the socioeconomic conditions; (iii) assess the organization&#13;
capacity; (iv) identify of possible conflicts and risks to introduce preventive&#13;
measures; (v) estimate free labor contributions, by gender and age; and&#13;
(vi) identify needs to strengthen community organization and training;&#13;
(d)   preparation of a participatory plan including: (i) soil conservation&#13;
activities; (ii) rural infrastructure; (iii) forestry and agroforestry;&#13;
(iv) technical training and assistance; (v) community organization&#13;
strengthening;&#13;
(e)   implementation directly controlled by community through its special&#13;
committee;&#13;
(f)   monitoring and evaluation through periodic meetings of special committee&#13;
and PRONAMACHCS; and&#13;
(g)   preparation of plan for following year.&#13;
18.         The community would receive practical training when preparing&#13;
participatory plans. This would be reinforced by more formal training for communities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
grasping this approach and able to incorporate it as part of decision-making. Training&#13;
would initiated in the third project year, once the participatory planning process is general&#13;
practice. Training would be provided to the most advanced communities; coverage would&#13;
begin with 40 micro-catchments in the third year to reach 125 the last year. By the end of&#13;
the project, at least 20 percent of the communities involved would be able to prepare&#13;
participatory plans on their own.&#13;
2. Micro-catchment Management Committees&#13;
19.         Ninety percent of the peasants agreed on the need to organize activities at&#13;
micro-catchment level. Peasants mentioned as main advantages of such organization:&#13;
(i) a more integrated execution of investment works; (ii) an increase in management&#13;
capacity; (iii) sharing experiences; (iv) marketing improvements; and (v) better land use.&#13;
Peasants consider as main obstacles to create micro-catchment committees: (i) the lack of&#13;
experience to undertake such organization and thus the need of training; (ii) distance&#13;
between communities. Other important problems mentioned were conflicts in some&#13;
miicro-catchments and differences in natural resources availability and development level&#13;
that might raise conflicts.&#13;
20.         These results show the importance of supporting communities creating&#13;
organizations larger than their boundaries and point out areas where potential conflicts&#13;
might occur. Therefore, it is necessary to initiate the process of organization at&#13;
community level to ensure community ownership. Peasants themselves suggested a&#13;
consultation process as a first stage to create a steering committee to promote the idea and&#13;
define a strategy. This process should also involve other entities, public and private,&#13;
acting at the micro-catchment level as well as municipal authorities.&#13;
21.         This process would include the following steps: (i) promotion to create&#13;
this committee and consultation among grass root organizations and authorities in each&#13;
community to reach an agreement on the subject; (ii) periodical meetings to initiate&#13;
common resolutions; (iii) annual meetings of community representatives, leaders, and&#13;
authorities to prepare a formal agreement to create the committee and prepare a common&#13;
action plan; (iv) concertation with public and private organizations, as well as local&#13;
authorities to decide upon complementary activities; (v) support to formalize the&#13;
organization of the committee; (vi) preparation of medium and long term programs at the&#13;
micro-catchment level; and(vii) training of participant members in each committee to be&#13;
able to prepare, implement and manage agreements on an accountable basis.&#13;
22.         The project would finance a gradual process including community&#13;
workshops, micro-catchment concertation meetings and training.&#13;
(a)   Community Workshops: Extension agents would introduce the concept&#13;
of micro-catchment organization, helping communities to identify actions&#13;
to be executed at the micro-catchment level; all 1,250 communities would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
carry out a yearly workshop to define such proposal; this process would&#13;
ensure active community participation instead of top-down decisions.&#13;
(b)   Micro-catchment Concertation Meetings: Although informal meetings&#13;
can be organized, PRONAMACHCS would ensure that at least once a year&#13;
communities in each micro-catchment would meet to reach agreements on&#13;
common actions and mechanisms to organize a micro-catchment&#13;
management committee.&#13;
(c)   Training to Organize and Manage Micro-catchment Committees: It is&#13;
expected that by the third year consultation and concertation processes&#13;
would be consolidated and that formation of committees would be in&#13;
process; to support these results participants in committees would receive&#13;
training in aspects such as: legal mechanisms and procedures,&#13;
administration and management; management for services provision, etc.&#13;
23.         As a result of this process it is expected that at least 50 of such committees&#13;
would be created and operating on sustainable basis; also 250 agreements of coordinated&#13;
actions and training of all participants in these committees are project goals.&#13;
3. Strengthening the Managerial Capacity of Community Organizations&#13;
24.         This training aims at efficient management of investments, business leaders,&#13;
a more efficient organization of communities and emerging of local initiatives. Three main&#13;
lines of training would be developed.&#13;
(a)   Training in Management of Revolving Stock of Agricultural Inputs.&#13;
Fund Committees are in charge of provision of agricultural inputs.&#13;
Presently their operational results have been mixed and training would&#13;
provide skills to improve performance and a more transparent management.&#13;
This training should ensure: (i) adequate integration and operation;&#13;
(ii) autonomous management by the community; and (iii) higher recovery&#13;
levels. Through this training, communities should be able to manage&#13;
independently and select the best alternative to recover inputs. At the end&#13;
of the Project, at least 1,000 revolving stocks would be operating properly&#13;
with average recovery levels of 70 percent.&#13;
(b)   Training in Management of Rural Investment Accounts. A special&#13;
committee manages the community works and resource administration&#13;
through an account administered jointly by this special committee and&#13;
PRONAMACHCS. Although this mechanism has been successfuil, it is&#13;
important to enable the committee to manage the account with decreasing&#13;
PRONAMACHCS supervision.&#13;
(c)   Training to Develop the Communities Managerial Capacity. This&#13;
training would be provided on demand to respond to particular needs of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
each community. A special menu of basic training would be prepared to&#13;
target community authorities and leaders and "promoters" designated by&#13;
communities. As a result of this training it is expected that each&#13;
community would have at least three promoters per community.&#13;
4. Support of Rural Women Participation&#13;
25.         As a recognition of the important role played by women in the Sierra and&#13;
their contribution to PRONAMACHCS efforts, a special program would support women&#13;
participating in the project with small productive projects, including: (i) small livestock&#13;
development; (ii) family food gardens; (iii) medicinal plant production; (iv) basic&#13;
processing of agriculture products. The general rules to obtain this incentives are:&#13;
(i) beneficiaries would contribute with al least 20 percent of the total cost; (ii) support is&#13;
subject to actual participation in conservation activities; (iii) activities should be&#13;
sustainable; (iv) beneficiaries are committed to disseminate their experiences in their&#13;
communities; and (v) investment is limited to US$1,500 per community.&#13;
5. Implementation&#13;
26.         Implementation of this component builds on PRONAMACHCS' existing&#13;
capacity. A specialist in Promotion and Community Development would be hired at&#13;
department level to guide implementation. This specialist would have: (i) experience in&#13;
community development and organization; (ii) knowledge about socioeconomic and&#13;
cultural conditions of Sierra communities; (iv) experience with PRONAMACHCS&#13;
activities; and (v) knowledge or training to be able to communicate in native languages.&#13;
The main functions would include to: (i) overlook implementation ensuring adequate&#13;
coverage and impact; (ii) coordinate design, execution and results of community training;&#13;
(iii) promote and coordinate different activities to implement micro-catchment&#13;
management committees; (iv) coordinate and evaluate component impact.&#13;
27.         The existing Promotion Unit in PRONAMACHCS would support&#13;
component implementation through activities such as: (i) design and preparation of&#13;
bilingual pamphlets; (ii) design and preparation of radio broadcast; (iii) support to execute&#13;
community workshops; (iv) support micro-catchment meeting organization; (v) design and&#13;
support of execution of Rural Women Participation Program; and (vi) promote&#13;
agreements with other public and private organizations.&#13;
6. Monitoring and Impact Evaluation&#13;
28.         Promotion and Participation. These actions have a quantitative dimension&#13;
that can be measured with two indicators: (i) coverage of promotion, for instance,&#13;
number of communities reached by radio broadcasts and pamphlets distributed; and&#13;
(ii) number of beneficiaries reached by the project. The qualitative dimension of&#13;
participation is more difficult to measure, nevertheless, the following results can provide&#13;
some valuable information: (i) free labor contribution per gender; (ii) attendance to&#13;
workshops and training courses; (iii) community representatives attending&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
micro-catchment meetings; (iv) number of committees created an working on a sustainable&#13;
basis; (v) number of participatory plans prepared by the communities themselves.&#13;
29.         Micro-catchmentManagement Committees. The simplest measure is to&#13;
account for the number of such committees integrated under the project; however, the&#13;
impact of such organization should consider real changes in the management of activities&#13;
at the micro-catchment level. The following indicators would be useful to both purposes:&#13;
(i) community workshops celebrated at the micro-catchment level; (ii) number of&#13;
micro-catchment annual meetings carried out; (iii) number of agreements signed and&#13;
implemented; and (iv) participation and support provided by municipal authorities.&#13;
30.         Strengthening Communities Managerial Capacity. Training and&#13;
experience would strengthen community management capacity. Such result can only be&#13;
measured in the medium or long term. However, it is important to monitor: (i) the&#13;
number of beneficiaries trained; (ii) success of different courses, measured by sustained&#13;
attendance and trainees evaluation of courses; and (iii) analysis of failures. To capture the&#13;
qualitative dimension of the project's impact on community traditional organizations the&#13;
following aspects can be useful: (i) number of input revolving stocks operating with rates&#13;
of recovery bigger than 70 percent; (ii) number of entrepreneur promoters working per&#13;
community; and (iii) emerging community initiatives in relation to conservation,&#13;
productivity improvements, marketing and/or entrepreneurial activities.&#13;
31.         Enhancing Women Participation. Women participation should be&#13;
monitored in all aspects of project implementation in quantitative and qualitative aspects.&#13;
Following indicators are recommended: (i) labor contributions; (ii) number of women&#13;
attending training courses; (iii) number of women appointed at any committees created&#13;
under the project; (iv) women attending micro-catchment meetings and/ or appointed as&#13;
community representatives; and (v) female entrepreneur promoters. Additionally,&#13;
programs implemented to be an incentive for women participation should be monitored&#13;
and evaluated considering aspects such as: (i) number of programs implemented and&#13;
beneficiaries (ii) replication of the programs in the community; and (iii) programs&#13;
operating on sustainable and self-sufficient basis.&#13;

POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, EXTENSION AND TRAINING&#13;
Rural Extension&#13;
1.          Organization. Practically all project components will be handled through&#13;
the extension structure. Extension will be coordinated, and to a large extent carried out,&#13;
by PRONAMACHCS, through its existing structure. An extension coordinator, assisted&#13;
by three professionals, will be responsible for extension coordination. The field structure&#13;
will consist of 20 PRONAMACHCS branch offices. Each office will cover about seven&#13;
micro-catchments, and will include a nucleus team of subject-matter specialists (SMS),&#13;
covering soil conservation, irrigation, forestry, and community strengthening aspects.&#13;
These teams will be responsible for project promotion, micro-catchment selection and&#13;
planning, and technical and administrative project support.&#13;
2.           Extension agents. Permanent technical assistance to the farmers will be&#13;
ensured by field extension agents - one per about seven communities. They will be&#13;
selected amongst PRONAMACHCS and MAG technical staff, according to their&#13;
professional profile and language proficiency, and deployed to the project after receiving&#13;
pre-service training. The current staff of PRONAMACHCS's 20 branches includes&#13;
60 SMS professionals (three per office) and 120 extension agents (six per office). The&#13;
foreseen incremental number of extension agents to be re-deployed to the project is&#13;
estimated at 100. This will raise the total number of project extension agents to 400, and&#13;
ensure an average staff of 14 extension agents per office by year three.&#13;
3.           Subject matter specialists. The SMS teams will be responsible for the&#13;
selection of micro-catchments and will coordinate rapid rural appraisals and preparation of&#13;
micro-catchment development plans. They will be further select, train, help and supervise&#13;
the field extension agents. They will also supervise the implementation of the&#13;
project-funded community investment accounts. Field extension agents will participate&#13;
with the SMS teams in the rapid rural appraisals and participatory planning of the&#13;
micro-catchments to which they are deployed. They will promote the organization of the&#13;
communities and interest groups and assist these groups to prepare land management farm&#13;
plans and implement the planned activities.&#13;
4.           Promoters. In each assisted community, extension agents will train two or&#13;
more local soil conservation promoters, elected by the community to help implementation&#13;
and assist farmers to adopt the recommended soil conservation technologies. Extension&#13;
agents will be permanently backed up in all these tasks by the regional SMS teams. A field&#13;
extension agents will visit an average of two communities per day. This will allow him to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
pay a weekly visit to each community, and dedicate one day per week for studies and&#13;
office work. Once a week, he will be accompanied by an SMS member.&#13;
5.           Costs. The costs of the extension component are estimated at&#13;
US$4.3 million.&#13;
Training&#13;
6.          Intensive training and periodic updating on soil and water management,&#13;
group dynamics, production technologies and economics will enable SMS and extension&#13;
agents to carry out their mandate. The training program will include the following main&#13;
activities: (i) pre-service training; (ii) seminars, workshops and short courses;&#13;
(iii) exchange of experiences; and (iv) technical visits to natural resources management&#13;
projects in other countries.&#13;
A. Pre-service Training&#13;
7.           The central objectives of pre-service courses are to familiarize the technical&#13;
staff with the project and supply them with the essential technical and operational&#13;
information for project implementation. The basic structure of these courses will include&#13;
elements on: (i) main natural resources degradation problems in Peru; their social and&#13;
economic context, and impact, past experience in addressing these problems; (ii) project&#13;
objectives, strategy, scope and design; (iii) participatory surveys and soil conservation&#13;
planning at micro-catchment level, the use of maps and images; (iv) technologies for&#13;
implementing the project's technical strategy; (v) operational strategy, extension&#13;
methodology, group dynamics, community organization; micro-catchment management;&#13;
revolving stock; and (vi) elements of rural economy applied to the Sierra.&#13;
8.           The above structure will be adapted, respectively to professionals&#13;
(graduates) and extension agents (technicians), in a differentiated manner, taking account&#13;
their previous training and experience with natural resources management in the Sierra.&#13;
The courses will have a duration of six days for professionals and ten days for extension&#13;
agents, will be administered by PRONAMACHCS specialists, national experts and&#13;
international consultants, and organized for groups of about 25 participants, covering a&#13;
total staff of 125 professionals and 250 extension agents.&#13;
B. Seminars and Workshops&#13;
9.           Their objective is to complement pre-service training and update the staffs&#13;
knowledge on technical and operational matters, with an important practical training&#13;
component with conspicuous field activities. They will be divided in national workshops,&#13;
and regional workshops.&#13;
10.         National workshops are designed to deepen the technical training of the&#13;
project's SMS professionals. They will also be used for evaluating the achievements of the&#13;
previous year and programming the activities of the subsequent year. National workshops&#13;
will generally be organized by specialty, including respectively soil conservation (physical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
structures and agronomic aspects), irrigation, and forestry. Three yearly national&#13;
workshops are foreseen, one by group of 20 professionals of each specialty (one&#13;
professional per regional office). The 7 Department directors would also participate,&#13;
totaling 27 participants by workshop. Each workshop will have an average duration of&#13;
three days.&#13;
11.          Regional workshops objectives are similar to those of national workshops,&#13;
but focused on Department-level aspects, and will involve all SMSs and extension agents&#13;
of each Department. During the first three years of the project, regional workshops will&#13;
aim essentially at complementing pre-service training, with practical courses scheduled&#13;
according to the seasonal cycle of field activities. In project years four and five, the&#13;
courses would focus on technical updating and improvement, essentially addressed to&#13;
department-level problems. The courses will have an average duration of two days.&#13;
C. Exchange of Experiences&#13;
12.          This training modality would stimulate the extension of successful local&#13;
experiences to the rest of the project area, through technical visits of project professionals&#13;
and extension agents to the areas of other PRONAMACHCS offices. Once a year two&#13;
representatives of each project office will spend one day visiting a conspicuous land&#13;
management experience in another jurisdiction, participating in field days or other events&#13;
especially organized for this purpose. The yearly number of participants would be 40.&#13;
D. Study Tours&#13;
13.          They envisage the exchange of experiences with natural resources&#13;
management projects in other countries, mainly in Latin America. It is envisaged to offer&#13;
each project-related professional the opportunity to participate in one such visits abroad,&#13;
over the five years of the project. The average number of professionals per group/year&#13;
will be 14 (total 70). Average duration is eight days per study tour.&#13;

SIERRA - NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND&#13;
POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT&#13;
ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL EVALUATION&#13;
1.          Introduction. Financial and economic analysis has been carried out for the major&#13;
project component, the Rural Investment Component, as well as for the project as a whole. The&#13;
underlying analysis is the result of consultant studies completed during preparation of the&#13;
project'5, and is essentially a financial analysis for the Rural Investment Component. The&#13;
underlying analysis has been adjusted to account for economic prices and transfer payments to&#13;
develop an economic analysis for the Component. Finally, overall project financial and economic&#13;
analysis has been prepared by building models based on the Component analysis and detailed costs&#13;
estimated for the overall project. The results of these analyses are summarized in the attached&#13;
Tables 1 through 4. The methodologies and assumptions utilized are described below.&#13;
2.           Target Population. It is estimated that the project would ultimately benefit over&#13;
75,000 poor families in about 1,250 communities throughout the Sierra. These families are very&#13;
poor or extremely poor, maintaining subsistence lifestyles on an average of one half or one&#13;
hectare of marginally cultivable land. Incomes are typically less than US$1,000 per family and&#13;
opportunities for alternative livelihoods are few.&#13;
3.           Methodology. Under the rural investment component, a large number of various&#13;
types of subprojects would be implemented in a variety of agroecological zones throughout the&#13;
Sierra. For example, these include three or four different types of soil conservation projects, a&#13;
half-dozen or more types of irrigation projects, construction of seed warehouses, various&#13;
reforestation activities, and improved agronomic techniques. Furthermore, these subprojects&#13;
would be implemented throughout the Sierra, where sub-regions have significantly different&#13;
climates due to varying altitudes and weather conditions. Finally, individual subprojects would be&#13;
selected for financing largely as the result of a demand-driven, community participatory process.&#13;
4.          In light of the above, rather than conduct financial and economic analysis for a set&#13;
of pre-defined specific subprojects, several types of subprojects have been analyzed, with the&#13;
objective of defining economically viable investment parameters. These subproject types have&#13;
been selected on the basis of PRONAMACHCS twelve years of experience. They are indicative&#13;
not only of subprojects expected to be implemented under the project but also of sub-regions in&#13;
the Sierra where it is likely they will be carried out.&#13;
15 Detailed studies were conducted by a team of international and local consultants. Under FAO and Bank&#13;
supervision, the results of these studies were later adjusted during project pre-appraisal. The studies and&#13;
adjusted results are located in the Project Files.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
5.           The analysis has been carried out on the basis of 12 farm models representative of&#13;
the principle agroecological zones. The models represent the present and future agriculture&#13;
scenarios of the different project areas. They focus primarily on crop development since data on&#13;
grazing and other activities are scarce and the project is in any case oriented towards agricultural&#13;
improvements. Cropping intensity and water use efficiency at the outset of the project reflect&#13;
current practice. With few exceptions, the specific crop models assume a constant input/output&#13;
relationship. While this is a conservative assumption, it allows to focus on project benefits related&#13;
to subproject enhancements and not speculative advances in agriculture development.&#13;
6.           For each subproject, farm models represent farm families who benefit primarily&#13;
from improvements in soil and water management. Increased production value results from&#13;
reducing losses due to soil erosion, increasing irrigated areas while maintaining relatively constant&#13;
cropping patterns, and reducing seed or crop losses due to poor storage capacity. In some cases,&#13;
the potential for enhanced agriculture development in higher value crops (e.g., onions) is currently&#13;
hindered primarily by poor irrigation. Thus, it is assumed that the development of such potential&#13;
under the project is directly related to irrigation improvement (as opposed to new agriculture&#13;
development practices). The models show an evolution over a twenty-year period, the expected&#13;
useful life of the subprojects (except for reforestation where only a one-time benefit is expected&#13;
about ten years after the initial investment). Most subprojects have a lag of about two to four&#13;
years before benefits begin to accrue and full development is only reached about eight years after&#13;
initial investments are made. Each model differs based upon current and expected cropping&#13;
patterns for a given area and its size.&#13;
7.           The models represent four different agricultural/technological approaches in three&#13;
different sub-regions of the Sierra. The agricultural approaches are: traditional dry agriculture,&#13;
dry agriculture with improved agronomic techniques, traditional irrigation agriculture, and&#13;
irrigation agriculture with improved agronomic techniques. While climatic and soil conditions are&#13;
extremely diverse throughout the Sierra, to simplify the analysis, three primary agroecological&#13;
zones have been identified. These are the High Sierra (3,400 - 4,000 meters), the Middle Sierra&#13;
(2,700 - 3,400 meters) and the Lower Sierra (2,000 - 2,700 meters). Each zone has a&#13;
representative set of crops, many of them highly localized and produced strictly for the internal&#13;
market, with potatoes being the most commonly produced among all three regions. Wheat and&#13;
corn are the only potentially international commodities and they are produced predominantly in&#13;
the Middle and Lower Sierra zones. Onions are also commonly produced in these two zones.&#13;
8.           For each model, with and without project scenarios have been analyzed on a per&#13;
hectare basis. This yields an incremental benefit per hectare which serves as the basis for&#13;
estimating benefits resulting from each subproject type. In general, benefits have been estimated&#13;
for a period of twenty years considering that the type of subproject types envisioned under the&#13;
project are of a long term investment nature; that is, several years may pass before tangible&#13;
benefits are realized. With these benefit flows, using discount rates of 8, 10, and 12 percent,&#13;
(acceptable levels of) investment cost parameters have been estimated on a per hectare basis.&#13;
These parameters serve as the basis for the investment limits defined in para. 4.15 of this Staff&#13;
Appraisal Report. Due to the highly localized nature of the subprojects, it is difficult to compare&#13;
these limits to "standard" or "internationally acceptable" investment levels. However, they are&#13;
generally at or below PRONAMACHCS average subproject investment costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
9.           The types of subprojects analyzed for each of the farm models are: absorption&#13;
terraces (TA), slow-forming terraces (TFL), ditches, reforestation, irrigation, intensive watershed&#13;
management (IWM) (agronomic improvements) and warehouses. For TA, TFL and irrigation&#13;
subprojects, for each sub-region of the Sierra, an incremental benefit per hectare has been&#13;
calculated. However, subprojects such as TA and TFL would be predominantly implemented in&#13;
the Middle and Upper Sierra where technical and economic viability of these subprojects is the&#13;
greatest. Similarly, irrigation subprojects would be implemented largely in the Middle and Lower&#13;
Sierra. As such, for TA and TFL subprojects, the incremental benefit per hectare used in the&#13;
financial and economic projections reflects the average of the benefit estimated for just the Middle&#13;
and Upper Sierra. For irrigation, the incremental benefit per hectare used in the projections is the&#13;
average of that estimated for the Middle and Lower Sierra. For ditches, the incremental benefit&#13;
per hectare is assumed to be only about 60 percent of that for TFL since, while the two are&#13;
technically usually implemented jointly, most of the benefits come from TFL. In the case of&#13;
reforestation and warehouses, benefit estimates are based on case experiences and data regarding&#13;
the sale of wood and reduction in seed losses respectively. The specific benefit estimates are&#13;
provided in the attached Tables 1-4 under the sections on Notes and Assumptions.&#13;
Rural Investment Component: Financial Analysis&#13;
10.          Using the above methodology, a financial rate of return for the Component has&#13;
been estimated. Additionally, drawing on documented experience from specific subproject cases,&#13;
sirnilar to those defined in the above farm models, the financial impact of subprojects on&#13;
beneficiaries has been estimated. Assumptions and results for this financial analysis as follows.&#13;
11.         Assumptions:&#13;
(a)   agricultural commodity prices are estimated using farm-gate prices for the Sierra,&#13;
averaged over the past several years to eliminate the impact of significant positive&#13;
price movements in the fourth quarter of 1995;&#13;
(b)   only agricultural activities are taken into consideration since agriculture is the&#13;
primary means of income/livelihood in the rural Sierra and the investments under&#13;
the project are oriented primarily towards improvements in agricultural output; as&#13;
such, benefits do not reflect improvements in grazing and trading activities which&#13;
could occur;&#13;
(c)   the cost of unskilled labor is estimated at 50 percent of the urban minimum wage,&#13;
yielding a cost of five soles per day;&#13;
(d)   recurrent costs following the project are primarily for operation and maintenance&#13;
of some of the investments; these costs are estimated yearly at 3 percent of&#13;
investment costs;&#13;
(e)   taxes and duties for investments are included in the investment costs;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
(f)    physical contingencies, estimated at 5 percent of investment costs, are included in&#13;
total costs; however, price contingencies are not since the impact of movements in&#13;
prices is demonstrated in the sensitivity analysis described below; and&#13;
(g)   for analyzing the financial impact of subprojects on beneficiary families: (i) inputs&#13;
provided under the subprojects are treated as short term in-kind loans without&#13;
financial cost; (ii) tools provided under the subprojects are treated as donations;&#13;
(iii) unskilled labor an in-kind contribution provided by beneficiaries during the&#13;
non-farming season; and (iv) income taxes on beneficiaries are not included since&#13;
families at the poverty level found under the project are typically exempt from&#13;
these taxes.&#13;
12.          Results. The results show that the subprojects are financially viable, particularly&#13;
before taking into consideration ongoing operation and maintenance costs. Without operation&#13;
and maintenance EM costs, all subprojects show average financial internal rates of return at&#13;
12 percent or better, except for subprojects with just agronomic improvement activities (where&#13;
the return is estimated at ten percent). Returns for reforestation are notably high (28 percent) but&#13;
these returns cannot be realized until eight to ten years after the initial investment, so significant&#13;
demand for these subprojects is not expected. The financial return for the overall Component is&#13;
estimated at just over 11 percent.&#13;
13.          Factoring in operation and maintenance costs, the returns for subprojects generally&#13;
fall by two to three percent and the return for the overall Component falls to ten percent.&#13;
However, the financial impact of subprojects on beneficiary families can be measured not only in&#13;
terms of financial returns but also in terms of the value of inputs and tools received. This is&#13;
particularly true since beneficiaries make no financial contributions under the subprojects and,&#13;
while they do contribute significant amounts of unpaid labor, this is done mostly in the off season&#13;
when alternative opportunities (particularly for cash) are few or non existent. The financial value&#13;
of these inputs and tools ranges greatly depending on the subproject type. Soil conservation (and&#13;
some reforestation) subprojects usually include more of these "incentives" than irrigation related&#13;
subprojects. Other subprojects, such as warehouses, with higher financial returns, include few&#13;
incentives. In any case, the financial value of these incentives can range from about US$500 to&#13;
US$2,500 per subproject/community - with about 50 families per community, this translates into a&#13;
financial value of about US$10 to US$50 per family for each subproject. This combines with&#13;
financial returns of around 10 to 12 percent for subprojects, which translate into incremental&#13;
income per family of about US$50 to US$200 for each subproject. Such incremental income is of&#13;
course spread out over several years, since subproject benefits only begin to flow after two to&#13;
four years in most cases, and only reach full development about eight years after the initial&#13;
investments are made. Nonetheless, for families with annual incomes of less than US$1,000, this&#13;
incremental income can have a significant impact, especially since families can and do often&#13;
participate in more than one subproject during a given year.&#13;
Rural Investment Component: Economic Analysis&#13;
14.          The economic analysis for the Component has been carried out using the same&#13;
methodology applied for the financial analysis. However, several adjustments have been made to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
convert, where applicable, financial prices into economic prices and to account for transfer&#13;
payments. The same assumptions used for the financial analysis have been used for the economic&#13;
analysis, except as follows:&#13;
15.          Assumptions:&#13;
(a)    most agricultural commodities in the Sierra are non-tradable; as such farm prices&#13;
for these products are the same as economic prices; for internationally marketable&#13;
products, wheat and corn, economic prices have been estimated taking the CIF&#13;
price plus the cost of shipping to the Sierra - the resulting economic prices are&#13;
slightly higher than the financial prices;&#13;
(b)   the economic/opportunity cost of unskilled labor is substantially less than the&#13;
financial cost since there are few work opportunities in the Sierra during the&#13;
non-farming season - this cost is estimated at three soles per day; and&#13;
(c)   taxes and duties for investments are excluded since they are transfer payments.&#13;
16.          Results. Economic returns improve significantly relative to financial returns,&#13;
primarily due to the reduced cost of unskilled labor assumed in the economic model, as well as the&#13;
reduction of taxes and subsidies. The unskilled labor is a weighty factor, particularly in soil&#13;
conservation subprojects. This impacts costs both on the investment side and in terms of&#13;
operation and maintenance. As such, taking this impact combined with the effect of eliminating&#13;
taxes and subsidies, the economic internal rate of return is higher than the financial internal rate of&#13;
return by over five points. Economic returns for the other subprojects generally improve by about&#13;
two to three points above financial returns, although for subprojects such as warehouses, where&#13;
there is relatively little unskilled labor involved, the economic and financial returns are about the&#13;
same. For the overall component, the economic return is about four points higher than the&#13;
financial return, after factoring in operation and maintenance costs.&#13;
17.          These results are favorable, although they may be skewed somewhat by the cost of&#13;
unskilled labor factor. Notwithstanding this factor, the economic results still do not incorporate&#13;
external benefits which are difficult to quantify. These include: reduced urban migration, reduced&#13;
soil erosion downstream in the more commercial lower watershed areas, enhanced security and&#13;
pacification in rural areas, and enhanced solidarity and social cohesion among rural communities.&#13;
18.          While these benefits are essentially non-quantifiable, some anecdotal evidence can&#13;
provide an idea of the potential magnitude of these benefits. For example, detailed studies have&#13;
shown that, at its current implementation level, PRONAMACHCS activities result in generating&#13;
approximately 65,000 jobs per year16. The proposed project would support at least this current&#13;
level of implementation on an annual basis, if not expand PRONAMACHCS implementation&#13;
capacity. As such, given a project life of five years (although implementation activities would&#13;
likely continue beyond this period), about 325,000 jobs could be generated. If urban migration is&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
reduced by only half that amount, assuming the social cost of maintaining a rural immigrant in&#13;
Lima is just half the minimum wage, this yields a savings of over US$80 million.&#13;
19.          Similarly, detailed studies have shown that, since about 1990, nearly&#13;
300,000 hectares of cultivable land in the coast have been lost to soil erosion17. One of the&#13;
principle causes of such soil erosion in the coast has been poor natural resource management in&#13;
the upper watershed areas of the Sierra. Naturally, poor agricultural practices in the coast are&#13;
also important factors leading to the same negative impact. Nevertheless, if poor resource&#13;
management in the Sierra is responsible for just 25 percent of the lost cultivable land, or&#13;
75,000 ha, the economic loss is substantial. Taking coastal land values at just US$1,000/ha (and&#13;
irrigated land values up to 10 times higher), the economic losses would be about US$75 million.&#13;
Project Analysis&#13;
20.          Building on the financial and economic evaluation described above for the Rural&#13;
Investment Component, and taking into consideration detailed investment costs estimated for the&#13;
project, financial and economic analysis for the overall project has been carried out. The&#13;
assumptions underlying the Component analysis remain the same for the overall project analysis.&#13;
The principle differences are: (a) for the overall project financial analysis, the costs for additional&#13;
components planned under the project are incorporated into the financial model; and (b) for the&#13;
overall project economic analysis, costs for additional components planned under the project are&#13;
largely excluded since associated benefits are non-quantifiable.&#13;
21.          Financial Analysis. After adding in additional costs for institutional strengthening,&#13;
training, and logistical support to PRONAMACHCS, the financial internal rate of return for the&#13;
overall project naturally falls by a couple of points. However, the return remains reasonable at&#13;
eight percent, still at or above the Government's cost of capital, and arguably an acceptable rate&#13;
of return for any project oriented towards poverty alleviation in the Sierra.&#13;
22.      Economic Analysis. The economic internal rate of return for the overall project is&#13;
again several points higher than the financial rate. This is again a function of the unskilled labor&#13;
and transfer payments factors described above, as well as the exclusion of additional component&#13;
costs with unquantifiable benefits. The economic return for the overall project is estimated at&#13;
12 percent, without taking into consideration the significant positive externalities described above.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
23.          Sensitivity analysis has been carried out for the Rural Investment Component and&#13;
overall project financial and economic analyses. Switching values are not calculated, since the&#13;
internal rates of return already reflect values assuming a net present value of zero and these return&#13;
rates are near the Bank standard opportunity cost of capital. Rather, movements in investment&#13;
costs and resulting benefits have been tested to determine the impact such shifts would have on&#13;

the internal rate of return. Movements of specific line item costs have also been tested,&#13;
particularly those that are weighty in the financial and economic models, such as unskilled labor.&#13;
24.          The results are shown in the attached Tables 1 through 4. In general, the internal&#13;
rate of return is somewhat sensitive to movements in the overall investment costs and benefits.&#13;
A 10 percent shift in costs or benefits yields more than a 1 percent shift in the rate of return. This&#13;
is the result of analyzing a select number of representative cases, with somewhat similar patterns,&#13;
rather than developing hundreds of models needed to represent the great diversity found in the&#13;
Sierra. It is also a function of the timing of investments and benefits, where benefits are heavily&#13;
front-loaded and benefits more back-loaded. Smoothing the investment costs and front-loading&#13;
more of the benefits would yield less sensitivity. However, that would be unrealistic since in&#13;
practice most of the subprojects do not yield results until after several crop rotations.&#13;
25.          Among specific cost items, unskilled labor is by far the most sensitive to&#13;
movements. A ten percent shift in unskilled labor yields nearly a one-half percent shift in the&#13;
return rate. As mentioned above, this is a function of the weightiness of this factor in the overall&#13;
cost model. This begs the question, are the unskilled labor cost assumptions reasonable.&#13;
The financial price of five soles per day is reasonable since it is representative of what has been&#13;
occasionally paid to unskilled workers under programs other than PRONAMACHCS. It is also&#13;
half the minimum wage paid in the urban sector, not unreasonable considering the cheaper living&#13;
costs in the Sierra relative to say Lima. On the other hand, FONCODES pays unskilled laborers&#13;
ten soles per day. This, however, tends to distort the rural labor market. First, cash payments for&#13;
unskilled labor in the Sierra are rare. Second, the level of payment is equal to or higher than what&#13;
a laborer would normally earn through his/her own traditional farming activities. As such,&#13;
FONCODES payments draw workers away from their normal activities for temporary work. This&#13;
provides an incentive for the local population to choose to work on Government projects just&#13;
because of the relatively high wages. It also creates an incentive for workers to promote projects&#13;
with higher labor requirements, regardless of their utility, because of the same wage factor.&#13;
26.          In sum, while the financial and economic models are somewhat sensitive to shifts&#13;
in key factors such as investment costs, benefits, and unskilled labor costs, the models are&#13;
reasonably reflective of reality and appropriately address distortions. As such, they serve as a&#13;
useful tool for monitoring movements of these key factors. In particular, investment costs,&#13;
including for unskilled labor, can and should be monitored closely to ensure they do not overly&#13;
exceed investment limits established by the above analysis. At the same time, since benefits have&#13;
been estimated conservatively (they do not include benefits from grazing and other non-farm&#13;
activities, nor externalities), there is little concern that the rates of return will shift in the wrong&#13;
direction.&#13;

Notes and Key Assumptions:&#13;
1) Figures may not add precisely due to rounding; they also may be slightly different than those in detailed cost tables due to slightly different exchange rate assumptions&#13;
2) Financial costs have been estimated as follows&#13;
a) investment costs lor inputs (insumos) have been reduced by 50% since they are partially incorporated in the calculations for incremental benetis&#13;
b) recurrent costs following the project have been estimated at 3% o0 investment costs&#13;
c) the price for mano de obra no ca8ficada is 5soles/ornal&#13;
d) farm prices (In the sierra) are used for all products; for tradable products wheat and corn, prices are 0.6 soles/kg and 0.4 solesfRg respectively&#13;
e) taxes and duties are Included In the base costs&#13;
3) Benefit streams for each subproject type have the following lag times (year aoter investment when benefit flows begin) and unit benefits per year.&#13;
a) Terrzas de Absorclon: 3rd, 800 soles/hia&#13;

Notes and Key Assumptions:&#13;
1) Figures may not add precisely due to rounding; they also may be slightly differert than those in detailed cost tables due to slightly different exchange rate assumptons&#13;
2) Economic costs have been eshmated as follows:&#13;
a) investment costs for training and InstitutIonal strengthening have been deducted since associated benelns are non-quantiliable&#13;
b) investment costs for inputs (insumos) have been reduced by 50% since they are partially incorporated in the calculations for incremental benefits&#13;
c) recurrent costa following the project have been estimated at 3% o1 investment costs&#13;
d) an economic price (opportunity cost) for mano de obra no calificada has been estimated at 3 solestjornal&#13;
e) economic prices for tradable products are estimated as: wheat = 0.64 soles/kg; corn = 0.49 solesIRg&#13;
1) taxes and duties are not Included since they represent transfer payments&#13;
3) Benelt streams for each subproject type have the lollowing lag times (year alter investment when benefit flows begin) and unit benetits&#13;

Notes and Key Assumptions:&#13;
1) Figures may not add precisely due to rounding: they also may be slightly different than those in detailed cost tables due to slightly dfferent exchange rate assumptions&#13;
2) Economic costs have been estmated as follows:&#13;
a) investment costs for training and instiutional strengthening have been deducted sincrassociated benefits are non-quantdiable&#13;
b) investment costs for Inputs (insumos) have been reduced by 50% since they are partially incorporated In the calculations tor incremental benefits&#13;
c) recurrent costs tollowrng the project have been estimated at 3% of investment costs&#13;
d) an economic price (opportunty cost) for mano de obra no caltficada has been estimated at 3 solesljornal&#13;
e) economic prices for tradable products are estimated as: wheat - 0.64 soles/kg; corn = 0.49 soles/kg&#13;
I) taxes and duties are not Included since they represent transfer payments&#13;
3) Benefit streams for each subproject type have the following lag tmes (year after investment when benefit flows begin) and unit benefits:&#13;
a) Terrazas de Absorcion: 3rd; 800 soles/ha&#13;
b) Terrazas de Formacion tents: 5th; 510 soles/ha&#13;
c) Zanjas de lntitracion: 5th; 300 solesnha&#13;
d) Retorestacion: 12th (one-time beneft); 55000 soles/ha&#13;
e) Riego: 2nd; 650 solestha&#13;
f) Manejo lntensroa: 2nd; 650 soles/ha&#13;
g) Almacenes: 2nda 1875 solee/almacen (25MT)&#13;

Monitoring and Evaluation Indicators&#13;
1.          PRONAMACHCS would introduce a coherent management information system&#13;
providing data on which monitoring and evaluation indicators can be based. The monitoring&#13;
indicators would provide information on: (i) project activities and inputs; and (ii) immediate&#13;
results (products). The proposed monitoring has to be complemented by ad-hoc studies to&#13;
evaluate the results of project activities which can not always be measured in numbers as well as&#13;
project impact. Such studies would cover, for instance, the degree of participatory planning,&#13;
impact of the community institutional strengthening component and impact of staff training.&#13;
2.          Project Monitoring. The monitoring system would be based on the management&#13;
information system. Basic information would be collected at the PRONAMACHCS branch levels&#13;
from promoters, extension agents and the accounting system. This information would cover all&#13;
PRONAMACHCS activities, including information needed for the Ministry of Finance budget&#13;
purposes. A simple reporting system would be introduced and summary information would be&#13;
transmitted monthly by computer diskette to the departmental offices which would then combine&#13;
information of all branches to be transmitted to the central PRONAMACHCS office in Lima.&#13;
Based on data received from the departmental offices, the central monitoring office would&#13;
produce three-monthly project monitoring reports. At branch and departmental level, no&#13;
project-specific reports would be required.&#13;
3.          The monitoring indicators would relate to specific project in and outputs and are&#13;
presented in the table below. As the project is demand-driven, all targets would have to be very&#13;
indicative estimations.&#13;
(a)   Participatory Identification and Formulation of Rural Investments: indicators&#13;
would include the number of maps, rapid rural appraisals and planning agreements&#13;
concluded.&#13;
(b)   Rural Investments: indicators would focus on the number of hectares in soil&#13;
conservation activities, irrigation and forestry; tools, materials and inputs provided;&#13;
labor days provided; families involved; subproject costs; tree nurseries constructed&#13;
and trees planted; warehouses constructed, etc.&#13;
(c)   Rural Community Strengthening: indicators would be the number of promotion&#13;
activities, courses, and participation of women in activities. More details are&#13;
described in paras 28 to 31 of Annex 2.&#13;
(d)   Strengthening of PRONAMACHCS: indicators would refer to procurement,&#13;
recruitment of staff, introduction of the management information system and&#13;
training programs.&#13;
4.          Project Results and Impact Assessment. The evaluation system would measure&#13;
project results and impact. An initial base survey would be carried out in the micro-catchments.&#13;
This basic survey would use data provided by the INRENA studies, the rapid rural appraisal and&#13;
some additional data collection which might be necessary to obtain the "without" project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
situation. A similar intermediate evaluation in twenty randomly selected micro-catchments would&#13;
be carried before the project mid-term review. A final evaluation would be carried out in the&#13;
whole project area by the end of the project. The evaluation methodology would include&#13;
questionnaire surveys, interviews with key informants, focus groups, case studies and direct&#13;
observation.&#13;
5.          The most important impact indicator relates to the overall objective of the project:&#13;
poverty alleviation through sustainable natural resources management. To measure the attainment&#13;
of such objective data would have to be kept on items such as the quantity of agricultural and&#13;
forest products marketed, composition of the family diet and the products offered in the local&#13;
stores, number of televisions in the community, houses with solid roofs, and storerooms&#13;
independent from the main living quarters.&#13;
6.          As far as the specific project objectives are concerned, the following result and&#13;
impact indicators would be used:&#13;
(a)   Participatory Identification and Formulation of Rural Investments: the number of&#13;
annual plans and agreements signed between PRONAMACHCS and the&#13;
communities would be the main indicator;&#13;
(b)   Rural investments: sustainability indicators such as the soil conservation and&#13;
reforested areas properly cultivated and maintained, increases in production and&#13;
average yields, changes in cropping patterns, protection of forest plantations,&#13;
number of families who benefit from project activities, soil conservation measures&#13;
carried out without direct project support, degree of use of warehouses&#13;
constructed with project support;&#13;
(c)   Strengthening of community organizations: the impact of this component can be&#13;
estimated by analyzing the decision-making process within the communities; their&#13;
capacity in procurement and management of the revolving input stocks; the&#13;
reimbursement rate; the creation of micro-catchment committees; initiatives taken&#13;
by women; the participation of women in committees and training programs; and&#13;
(d)   Strengthening of PRONAMACHCS: the impact of this component would be&#13;
measured in attitude changes of staff towards community participation and&#13;
economic aspects in rural investments; the operation of the management&#13;
information and monitoring system; and the degree by which the branches and&#13;
departmental offices operate more efficiently.&#13;

PERU&#13;
SIERRA - NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND&#13;
POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT&#13;
ENviRONMENTAL IMPACT AND MITIGATION MEASURES&#13;
1.          The project would generally have-long term beneficial environmental&#13;
effects on water and soil resources at the micro-catchment level. These beneficial effects&#13;
include soil and water conservation, reduced sedimentation in streams and improvements&#13;
in water quality. The project would also reduce sedimentation to the coastal river&#13;
catchments, thereby reducing inputs of nutrients from fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides&#13;
to downstream areas. The integration of environmental considerations into the&#13;
construction and operation of small irrigation projects and other off-farm activities at&#13;
PRONAMACHCS and community levels would mitigate some localized negative&#13;
environmental impact. Since there would be numerous projects implemented within the&#13;
micro-catchments, the overall project would provide cumulative beneficial effects on&#13;
water quality and environmental quality. The concept of multiple use at some of the small&#13;
water storage projects may also provide greater environmental benefits if carefully planned&#13;
and carried out. The mitigation and enhancement measures suggested in Table I should&#13;
ensure the attainment of the above benefits.&#13;
2.          The impacts associated with off-farm activities should be minor, but are&#13;
highly dependent on the type of activities and site specific characteristics. Dewatering&#13;
would affect the aquatic resources and wildlife associated with a stream. Constructing&#13;
warehouses would probably have limited impact. Most of the mitigation measures to&#13;
control soil erosion and disposal of waste materials should be adequate in these cases.&#13;
3.          PRONAMACHCS has good experience in preparing small irrigation&#13;
projects and implementing them. However, from the evidence of a recently constructed&#13;
small irrigation pond and channel, it was obvious that PRONAMACHCS and the affected&#13;
community have not recognized the need to terrace and re-vegetate the construction lay&#13;
down areas adjacent to the completed canals or storage reservoirs. As a result, substantial&#13;
long term soil erosion and runoff problems would result and impact water quality in&#13;
adjacent canals and small streams after construction is completed. A MAG official&#13;
commented that environmental protection and restoration of the construction area are not&#13;
a great concern in Peru nor are they a part of the project activities. This policy and&#13;
practice, however, would change during project implementation because the adverse&#13;
environmental effects from these construction areas can undermine the project's water and&#13;
soil management benefits in the micro-catchment.&#13;
&#13;

Increased erosion due to livestock   Very likely                  Define areas where potential&#13;

ponds can cause water quality&#13;
degradation.&#13;
4.             To address the above concerns, the project needs to integrate a simple&#13;
environmental impact assessment and an environmental mitigation program into each step&#13;
of the project preparation process now in place at PRONAMACHCS. For example, a&#13;
standardized checklist of environmental measures to prevent erosion and excessive runoff&#13;
would be included in the project operational manual and implemented for each subproject.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -&#13;
The entire project cycle would include environmental restoration and protection of the&#13;
construction site and environmental measures would be taken after the civil works are&#13;
completed to protect the micro-catchment from excessive soil erosion and adverse water&#13;
quality impacts. These measures are fairly standardized and include many of the&#13;
mitigation measures in the above table.&#13;
5.          PRONAMACHCS staff require some basic training in environmental&#13;
impact assessment and in the implementation of environmental measures with materials&#13;
available in the micro-catchment. Training for the community may also be advantageous.&#13;
Training would also be given to farmers in applying pesticides, fungicides and herbicides&#13;
to ensure that these chemicals are properly applied at the proper rates. Washing of and&#13;
disposal of empty chemical containers would be strongly discouraged.&#13;
6.          The concept of multiple use of small irrigation ponds should be explored&#13;
with communities and also factored into the design of such projects. For example,&#13;
growing fish in these ponds could diversify the food supply and supplement the incomes of&#13;
communities. This proposal would require an investigation to determrine the suitability of&#13;
native fish to be successfully raised in the ponds in a cost-effective manner.&#13;
7.          To minimize the adverse cumulative effects on water quality from major&#13;
road construction and the construction of other small irrigation projects being undertaken&#13;
in the Sierra, MAG also needs to coordinate more closely with the Ministry of&#13;
Transportation and FONCODES to ensure that measures are routinely taken to minimize&#13;
soil erosion and water quality impacts on streams and rivers. Failure to reach a consensus&#13;
with the Ministry of Transportation on this issue would have serious consequences for the&#13;
entire water and soil management program in the Sierra. Over longer periods of time and&#13;
overshadow the beneficial effects of environmentally sound water and soil management&#13;
practices if left unaddressed.&#13;
8.          To avoid environmental damage from the use of agricultural chemicals,&#13;
PRONAMACHCS would provide a positive list of chemicals to be financed under the&#13;
project. This list and any modifications thereof would be analyzed and approved by the&#13;
Bank. Additional training would also be provided to extension agents and farmers in the&#13;
use of these chemicals.&#13;

PERU&#13;
SIERRA - NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND&#13;
POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE OF LEGAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
ON INDIGENOUS PEOPLES&#13;
Background&#13;
1.          The project recognizes that it is important to raise the status and economic&#13;
level of indigenous peoples to alleviate poverty and social marginalization in the area. The&#13;
Bank recognizes the importance of indigenous peoples' issues as evident in its Operational&#13;
Directive (OD) 4.20, "Indigenous Peoples". OD 4.20 applies to this project because its&#13;
goal is to ensure that indigenous people receive culturally compatible social economic&#13;
benefits from development projects.&#13;
2.          OD 4.20 also states that the legal framework concerning indigenous&#13;
peoples should be assessed with special attention given to their land rights, as well as&#13;
access to natural resources (OD 4.20, para. 15 (a)). Therefore, it is important to&#13;
understand the domestic legal framework surrounding the indigenous people in order to&#13;
implement the project effectively. Special attention should be given to indigenous peoples&#13;
rights in the context of the Peruvian Constitution and legislation such as the Ley de&#13;
Comunidades Campesinas, Agrarian Law, Water Law, etc.&#13;
Qualification&#13;
3.          The consultant/specialist should either be a lawyer or a legal professional.&#13;
S/he must have extensive knowledge of indigenous peoples' policies in Peru. The legal&#13;
specialist will draw upon his/her knowledge and expertise of laws involving indigenous&#13;

            The general objective of the
            Sierra-Natural Resources Management and Poverty Alleviation
            Project is to help alleviate the poverty of rural Sierra
            people. Specific project objectives are to assist the poor
            to: (1) improve sustainable management of natural resources
            through soil conservation measures and reforestation at the
            micro-catchment level; (2) increase rural production and
            productivity through introduction of irrigation and improved
            agricultural practices; and (3) strengthen their rural
            organizations so that they can become autonomous and
            sustainable entities.  The project has four components: (1)
            participative identification and formulation of rural
            investments in micro-catchments; (2) rural investments; (3)
            strengthening of rural community institutions; and (4)
            logistical support and training to the implementing agency (PRONAMACHCS).
