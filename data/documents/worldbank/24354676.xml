ï»¿ANNEX 3&#13;
Harnessing Innov ition for Financial Inclusion (HiFi) Programme&#13;
I.     The Need &amp; Background&#13;
Access to services such as borrowi ig, saving or sending money, or secured and affordable payments&#13;
helps improve the lives of individua s and families, supports the growth of small business, creates jobs,&#13;
and provides poor people with the neans to withstand shocks and work their way out of poverty. An&#13;
estimated 2.5 billion adults do not f ave access to formal financial services. 76 percent of the adults in&#13;
Sub-Saharan Africa and 67 perceni of adults in South Asia do not have access to formal financial&#13;
services, compared to only 11 percert in high-income countries. In low income countries (LICs), women,&#13;
on average, are 10 percent less likeli than men to have access to formal financial services while people&#13;
living in rural areas are nearly 15 per ,ent less likely to have access than their urban counterparts.&#13;
Technology has the power to bringing the financially excluded masses-especially in the developing world&#13;
in to the fold of formal financial services as it reduces the costs associated with the small value&#13;
transactions; reaches out to larger numbers of people with innovative, low cost electronic payment&#13;
instruments (e.g. mobile phones, pa ment cards, internet e-accounts, etc.) and delivery channels (airtime&#13;
sellers, grocery shop owners, Poini of Sale systems, the internet, etc.). Technology-enabled delivery&#13;
channels and business models for f nancial services are broadly described as correspondent/branchless&#13;
banking because they enable deliver  of financial services outside the limited reach of conventional bank&#13;
branches that overcome the physical infrastructure barrier to access to financial services.&#13;
However, barring a few highly succ ssful examples, most digital financial services initiatives have failed&#13;
to deliver large scale results in term, of reaching the un- and under-banked. Notable constraints relate to&#13;
limited business know-how, including with regard to business model design and market demand, risk&#13;
aversion, risk capital, misaligned inc -ntives and regulatory landscape.&#13;
Recognizing that technology has the potential to transform delivery of financial services at the base of the&#13;
pyramid, the UK Government Depa Iment for International Development (DFID) is supporting financial&#13;
inclusion through a new programmc called Harnessing Innovation for Financial Inclusion ("HiFi" or the&#13;
"Programme"). The aim of the Pro ;ramme is to leverage technology and innovative service models to&#13;
deepen access to formal financial sei vices on a commercial and sustainable basis.&#13;
II.    Objective of the Programme&#13;
The objective of the Programme is to help expand access to formal financial services to un- and under-&#13;
banked people, including, but not lii nited, to women and people in fragile and conflict affected areas on a&#13;
commercially sustainable basis. 1 he Programme will do this by: (i) providing targeted technical&#13;
assistance to financial service pro -iders to help them develop and scale technology driven business&#13;
models to deliver financial services to those who currently do not have any or adequate access; (ii)&#13;
providing knowledge and suppor to regulators and policy makers in developing countries, and&#13;
international standard setting bodies, to enhance enabling environment for technology-enabled delivery of&#13;
financial services; and (iii) providing knowledge and expertise to target developing countries in&#13;
implementing a strategic framework for integrating the modernization of government, retail, and&#13;
remittance payment systems.&#13;
9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Harnessing Innovation for Financial Inclusion Programme will be jointly delivered by IFC, the World&#13;
Bank, including CGAP. HiFi promol es a model of partnership in line with the principles of: ownership,&#13;
alignment harmonization, managinE for results and mutual accountability. For HiFi, this involves&#13;
introducing clear accountabilities in I rogramme management, setting targets, assessing effectiveness, and&#13;
monitoring results.&#13;
III.   Components&#13;
The Programme will consist )f three (3) components, which will be implemented by the World&#13;
Bank through the Finance and Marke :s Global Practice including the Consultative Group to Assist the&#13;
Poor (CGAP), and IFC, through four separate trust funds:&#13;

poor based on a glot al leaming agenda.&#13;
(b)    Provision of expert knowledge and technical assistance, where appropriate jointly with&#13;
the World Bank, to policy-makers and regulators for enhancing the enabling environment&#13;
for harnessing of tec inology in delivery of financial services to the poor.&#13;
(c)    Research on needs, preferences, and behaviors of poor people and financial service&#13;

(d)    Facilitation of dial gue and coordination between providers and policy-makers to&#13;
advance innovations.&#13;

and may be revised by agreement be ;ween the Donor and CGAP:&#13;
(i)   Bangladesh&#13;
(ii)  Ghana&#13;
(iii)  India&#13;

(v)   Myanmar&#13;

(i)   Afghanistan&#13;
(ii)  Bangladesh&#13;
(iii)  Cote d'Ivoire&#13;
(iv)  Ghana&#13;
