&#13;
I t is my pleasure to present to you here the sixth edition of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Kenya Economic Update.&#13;
  Following economic turbulence at the end of 2011, the Government of Kenya raised interest rates, and&#13;
reduced public spending, to help stabilize the economy in 2012. Inflation is now declining, and the exchange&#13;
rate is more stable. Even so, the outlook for 2012 remains mixed, as macroeconomic instability tends to&#13;
increase around elections, and the crisis in the Euro zone is clouding the international economic outlook. This&#13;
is why we chose as the title of this report â&#128;&#156;Walking on a Tightropeâ&#128;&#157;.&#13;
&#13;
This report has three main messages. First, Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s economy is stabilizing, although it remains vulnerable to&#13;
domestic and external shocks. After sailing through rough waters in 2011, the World Bank projects growth&#13;
of 5.0 percent for 2012 and 2013, providing shocks are avoided. Second, Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s high and widening current&#13;
account deficit can be interpreted to mean that the country is living beyond its means. To address this issue,&#13;
it is time to rebalance the economy by increasing savings for investmentâ&#128;&#148;and also increasing exports. Third,&#13;
the East African Community (EAC) presents many opportunities for Kenya, but non-tariff barriers to trade&#13;
remain considerable. Kenya can lead the way to deeper EAC integration, by helping to lift non-tariff barriers,&#13;
and so unlocking regional trade. This would help to reduce Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s trade deficit, as well as its domestic food&#13;
prices.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank remains committed to helping Kenya to walk the tightrope successfully, and to rebalance&#13;
the economy through regional integration. The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s series of Economic Updates, which we publish in a&#13;
new edition every six months, have become our leading vehicle to analyze development trends in Kenya, and&#13;
to contribute to the implementation of the Bank's strategy for Sub-Saharan Africaâ&#128;&#148;a strategy that puts a&#13;
special emphasis on knowledge and partnerships. With these reports, we aim to support all those who want&#13;
to improve the economic management of Kenya. As in the past, we are proud to have worked with many&#13;
key Kenyan stakeholders during the preparation of this report. We hope that you too will join us in debating&#13;
policy issues that are topical in Kenya today, and in making your contribution to helping Kenya to grow, and to&#13;
achieve a permanent reduction in poverty.&#13;

This sixth edition of the Kenya Economic Update was prepared by a team led by Jane Kiringai together with&#13;
John Randa, Nora Carina Dihel, Ian Mills and Peter Warutere with supervision from Wolfgang Fengler. The&#13;
core team consisted of Betty Maina, Allen Dennis, Catherine Ngumbau, Caroline Wambugu, and Lucy Wariara.&#13;
&#13;
The team acknowledges contributions from Andrew Roberts, Geoff Handley, Aurelien Kruse, Miriam Omolo,&#13;
Olivier Cadot, Julien Gourdon, Laban Maiyo, Fred Wamalwa, and Roger Sullivan.&#13;
&#13;
The report benefitted from insights of several peer reviewers including Nehemiah Ngâ&#128;&#153;eno, Mombert Hoppe&#13;
and Paul Brenton. Humberto Lopez and Johannes Zutt provided overall guidance to the team.&#13;
&#13;
Partnership with key Kenyan policy makers was instrumental in the production of this report. On May 30,&#13;
2012, a draft of the report was presented at the Quarterly Economic Roundtable. The meeting was attended&#13;
by senior officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, the Kenya Institute&#13;
of Public Policy and Research Analysis, the Kenya Revenue Authority, the International Monetary Fund, the&#13;
National Economic and Social Council, and Office of the Prime Minister.&#13;

&amp;#12;                        MAIN MESSAGES AND KEY RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
                                                     Main Messages&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s economy is stabilizing but still vulnerable. At the end of 2011, the government increased interest rates and&#13;
   lowered the fiscal deficit by curbing expenditures, temporarily stabilizing the economy. Inflation declined, the exchange&#13;
   rate stabilized, and economic growth slowed in 2011 to 4.4 percent. The outlook for 2012 is mixed. With economic&#13;
   stability and good rains, growth could reach 5 percent in 2012 and 2013. However, another series of shocks (increased&#13;
   oil prices, a poor harvest, the euro zone crisis, or domestic instability) could easily create renewed economic turbulence,&#13;
   and slow down economic growth to 4.1 percent.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The current account deficit has increased and Kenya remains vulnerable to external shocks. High oil prices and weak&#13;
   exports have widened Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s trade deficit, and this has contributed to a current account deficit of 13.1 percent of GDP,&#13;
   a record high for Kenya and amongst the highest external deficits in the world. Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s exports remain few (tea, tourism,&#13;
   horticulture) and its import bill remains vulnerable to high oil price increases.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Kenya can improve its trade balance, lower prices and improve food security by reducing non-tariff barriers to trade.&#13;
   The EAC now trades more with itself than with any other region of the World. However, Kenya imposes numerous rules&#13;
   and regulations across a wide variety of sectors on imports, particularly from EAC partner states. Where these rules&#13;
   and regulations are poorly designed or implemented, they become non-tariff barriers. In the food sector, if Kenya were&#13;
   to reduce non-tariff barriers it would ease domestic food prices, help the poor and enable the EAC market to boost&#13;
   production in food surplus countries â&#128;&#147; which is win-win for both EAC producers and Kenyan consumers.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Kenya is in an excellent position to benefit from EAC integration and expand its trade in services. Kenya is a net&#13;
   importer of goods but a net exporter of services. Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s services have experienced dynamic growth and the sector has&#13;
   further potential for expansion. However, regulatory barriers restrict services, particularly in the banking, professional&#13;
   and business sectors. Services trade liberalization and regulatory reform are needed to enable Kenya to benefit fully&#13;
   from EAC integration.&#13;
&#13;
                                 Key Recommendations for Economic Management&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Keeping inflation low remains vital for Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s economic recovery. Tight monetary and fiscal policies in 2012 have&#13;
   helped Kenya to regain macroeconomic credibility. Any reduction in interest rates should be gradual to maintain&#13;
   macroeconomic stability and not endanger external financial inflows currently supporting the shilling. Similarly, fiscal&#13;
   consolidation should continue but now needs to strike the right balance between budget cuts and priority investments&#13;
   for growth especially in transport, electricity and water.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 As the economy stabilizes, it is time to change gear from short-term stabilization to structural reforms for sustained&#13;
   growth. Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s competitiveness in some sectors has declined (as domestic prices, including food, energy and transport,&#13;
   remain elevated) and this is putting pressure on exportersâ&#128;&#153; margins as well as on overall competitiveness. As a result,&#13;
   non-tradable sectors, especially services and construction, are driving growth while the share of tradable sectors,&#13;
   especially manufacturing, is declining. It is time to address these imbalances and to promote exports.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Kenya needs to increase public and private savings. Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s growth is mainly driven by consumption. Domestic savings&#13;
   have been declining and the excess of investments over savings is increasing the current account deficit. In short, Kenya&#13;
   is living beyond its means. Tax and expenditure policies can be used to cut back consumption and create incentives to&#13;
   increase savings and investments.&#13;
&#13;
                                   Key Recommendations for Regional Integration&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Establish a trade regulatory committee and consult stakeholders. The trade regulatory committee should review&#13;
   existing rules and regulations - removing those that cannot be justified - and inform the design and implementation&#13;
   of new rules in the least trade-restrictive manner, without compromising legitimate public policy objectives. It has&#13;
   been shown in the past that an inclusive and transparent process with stakeholders is crucial for successful regional&#13;
   integration.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Develop an effective monitoring mechanism with possible sanctions for non-compliance. The COMESA-EAC-SADC&#13;
   Tripartite online reporting and resolution system is showing signs of encouraging progress and good practice. The binding&#13;
   dispute settlement processes of the WTO, and the experience of the EU in establishing a legally binding mechanism with&#13;
   sanctions for non-compliance, provide additional relevant models for the EAC to consider.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Eliminate regulatory barriers, and disseminate market opportunities, in trade in services. Reforms should focus on&#13;
   aligning regulatory frameworks in financial services and mutually recognizing professional qualifications. Collaboration&#13;
   should be encouraged between universities and professional associations to address skills-shortages and support given&#13;
   to the Export Promotion Council to expand dissemination of market information on services to Kenyan firms.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I  n 2012, Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s economy has been on a tightrope. Policy makers have had to walk a fine line between&#13;
   stabilizing the economy and maintaining the growth momentum. While inflation has declined, the&#13;
 exchange rate stabilized, and the fiscal position improved, fundamental economic imbalances continue to&#13;
 make Kenya vulnerable to shocks. In the absence of economic and social turbulence, Kenya should grow&#13;
 at 5 percent in 2012 and 2013, which would still be substantially below its neighbors. Kenya has been&#13;
 benefitting from the integration and growth momentum in the East African Community (EAC), which has&#13;
 become one of the most vibrant economic regions in the world. However, despite impressive increases in&#13;
 trade between the five EAC partners in recent years, there is still a large untapped potential. EAC trade&#13;
 could increase several-fold if unnecessary restrictions in the trade of goods and services â&#128;&#147;particularly non-&#13;
 tariff barriers- were removed.&#13;

interest rates during the third quarter of 2011 and&#13;

prudent fiscal policies sent important signals to the&#13;

markets and this also helped to stabilize the exchange&#13;
rate. Second, inflation has started to decline sharply,   relatively low levels of debt, a stable exchange rate&#13;
thanks to lower international food and energy prices.     and declining inflation, Kenya again has the space to&#13;

Over the last decade, Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s imports have grown                                                       medium-term, policies in both sectors will have an&#13;

&amp;#12;The State of Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s Economy&#13;
&amp;#12;1. Stabilizing but vulnerable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  I   n 2012, Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s economy returned to a more stable path. Inflation is declining and is below 10 percent; the&#13;
      exchange rate has stabilized and low fiscal deficits have brought debt levels to below 45 percent. While&#13;
    Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s economic growth slowed in 2011 to 4.4 percent, it is now back on track, with economic stability&#13;
    and good rains, and is projected to reach 5 percent in 2012 and 2013. At the same time, Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s economy&#13;
    is more vulnerable than ever to shocks, due to a large and widening current account deficit, which could&#13;
    reach 15 percent of GDP in 2012. Another oil price shock, poor harvest, or an episode of domestic instability,&#13;
    could easily create renewed economic turbulence. Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s exports continue to be driven by traditional&#13;
    products, and are sold to traditional markets. At a global level, Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s exports remain few (tea, tourism,&#13;
    and horticulture) and are recording modest growth. However, in Africa, especially East Africa, trade has&#13;
    been expanding rapidly, which demonstrates the potential of regional integration for Kenya.&#13;

In an environment of global turbulence and&#13;
 domestic shocks, Kenya recorded moderate&#13;
growth of 4.4 percent in 2011. For the second&#13;
                                                                                           2010 (see figure 1.1 for details).&#13;

growth across all quarters and sectors, even though&#13;
agriculture performed poorly. The agriculture sector                                       been growing at an average of 3.5 percent per year,&#13;
growth declined from 6.4 percent in 2010, to 1.6                                           well below the average for Sub-Saharan Africa (5.5&#13;
percent in 2011. This is attributed to dry weather                                         percent, excluding South Africa) and significantly&#13;
conditions in 2011. However, in terms of total value,                                      slower than the East African Community (EAC)&#13;
Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s export crops benefited from favorable global                                       countries, some of which are among the fastest&#13;
prices, which compensated for reduced output and                                           growing developing countries in the world. For&#13;
explained the increased export earnings. Growth in                                         example, Rwanda grew at 7.9 percent, Uganda 7.2&#13;
the services sector remained robust, at 5.1 percent,                                       percent, and Tanzania 6.7 percent during the 2008-&#13;
though this was at a slower pace than in previous                                          2011 period (see figure 1.2).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
        Box 1.1: The case of interest rate controls in Kenya: why it was a bad idea, and alternative options&#13;
&#13;
 Evidence around the world demonstrates that attempts to control prices, especially interest rates, almost always backfire, often&#13;
 leading to higher interest rates and usually hurting the poor most. There are three main reasons for these unintended outcomes.&#13;
 First, any interest rate ceiling means that credit has to be rationed, in which case there is no guarantee that the most productive&#13;
 investment receives the credit. Often credit is rationed on political grounds and the banks that give out these loans often donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
 get repaid, putting their balance sheets in jeopardy. Kenya already has a number of painful experiences: in the mid 1980s 11 banks&#13;
 collapsed and in the 1990s 23 banks became insolvent, some of which were put under receivership and merged under consolidated&#13;
 institutions. Second, with interest rate caps, there emerges a â&#128;&#156;curb marketâ&#128;&#157; in credit, with lenders charging exorbitant interest rates&#13;
 to (typically poor) people who have no other option than to borrow in these parallel markets. Third, in the longer run, interest rate&#13;
 ceilings make people reluctant to put their money in banks, leading to slower financial development, which in turn hampers growth.&#13;
 Alternative ways to bring interest rates down include:&#13;
   (i) Promote competition and transparency. The CBK could direct commercial banks to adopt the Annual Percentage Rate (APR)&#13;
       framework, which would facilitate full disclosure on the cost of borrowing to customers. The APR is the effective interest&#13;
       rate that a borrower pays on a loan. Currently, there are too many hidden charges. In addition, the CBK could ensure that&#13;
       the weighted average lending and deposit rates for every commercial bank and deposit taking micro-finance Institution are&#13;
       posted on the CBK website each month by type of loan. This would allow consumers to effectively evaluate their lending and&#13;
       borrowing options.&#13;
  (ii) Improve efficiency in the banking industry. Even though Kenya has adopted IT systems which will have brought down operating&#13;
        costs for commercial banks (e.g. ATMs, fewer back-office operations and front office operations), these lower costs have not&#13;
        been passed on to customers: banking charges are still very high in Kenya when compared to other countries. The CBK and&#13;
        Kenya Bankers Association need to further review the interconnectivity of bank platforms, as a way of bringing down operations&#13;
        costs of banks.&#13;
  (iii) Sharing both positive and negative customer information via a credit bureau would reduce non-performing loans. Parliament&#13;
        should pass laws to force banks to share both positive and negative customer information. When banks reward good borrowers&#13;
        with lower rates and punish those with negative ratings by charging higher rates, both the share of non-performing loans and&#13;
        the cost of borrowing will decline.&#13;
  (iv) Improving efficiency of commercial banks by encouraging them to lend to each other in the horizontal repurchase market.&#13;
       Banks are hesitant to provide such lending since the master-repurchase agreement does not guarantee them collateralized&#13;
       assets in the event of default. The CBK should amend the master-repurchase agreement to enable banks holding government&#13;
       securities as collateral to realize it upon debtor default.&#13;
   (v) Addressing the need for a comprehensive consumer protection policy for financial services is a cornerstone for a vibrant&#13;
       financial market as consumers are encouraged to take greater responsibility in their financial decision-making. This will include&#13;
       tightening consumer laws to protect bank customers.&#13;
  (vi) Reduce overall costs for customers. The authorities need to cap legal fees on discharging/charging securities, eliminate stamp&#13;
       duty on debentures/charges, and allow sharing of securities.&#13;

A larger share of total spending is allocated to the                  Meanwhile, recurrent spending was constrained at or&#13;

2. Growth Prospects for 2012 and 2013&#13;
&#13;
   T       he World Bank projects an average GDP growth rate of 5.0 percent in the medium-term. Macro stability&#13;
           has been restored but remains fragile. The prevailing conditions through the first half of 2012, call for a&#13;
        cautious approach to monetary and fiscal policy management. It may be too early to relax monetary policy,&#13;
        but high interest rates will nevertheless slow down investment. The two most significant downside risks to&#13;
        the growth outlook are: (i) the rising oil prices; and, (ii) the crisis in the euro zone, which could push the&#13;
        current account deficit to over 15 percent of GDP. The war in Somalia, preparations for general elections,&#13;
        and the roll-out of devolved government, are likely to increase fiscal pressure which is likely to be managed&#13;
        through cut backs in development spending.&#13;

&#13;
        Box 3.1: Making Oil work for Kenya: Oil Management Challenges&#13;
&#13;
  Avoiding â&#128;&#156;Dutch diseaseâ&#128;&#157;: The oil sector has limited linkages with other sectors of the economy. A big resource boom will increase&#13;
  the demand for labor, drive up wages and thereby prices for non export sectors such as services and real estate. This leads to a real&#13;
  appreciation and thus hurts the export sector and import-competing sector. In the extreme it could lead to a deindustrialization of&#13;
  the country â&#128;&#147; the so called â&#128;&#156;Dutch diseaseâ&#128;&#157;. The Arab uprising has demonstrated the dangers of jobless growth.&#13;
&#13;
  Strong policy and legal framework to embed transparency in oil revenue management: A strong legal framework will be required&#13;
  to ensure there is an open and transparent system for the management and use of oil revenues. Kenya can leverage good practice to&#13;
  start on sound footing:&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Kenya can learn from Ghanaâ&#128;&#153;s Petroleum Revenue Management Act, which is hailed as a world class piece of legislation, providing&#13;
     for the collection, allocation and management of upstream petroleum revenue, and defining a strong and transparent mechanism&#13;
     for monitoring oil receipts and for spending those revenues.&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Kenya can participate in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The EITI emphasizes that governments should&#13;
     provide up to date and credible information to citizens on revenues collected, oil reserves, production and prices and fiscal regimes&#13;
     for private investors. The reports are then audited and made publicly available on a regular basis. For instance, in Nigeria the EITI&#13;
     audited accounts for 1999 â&#128;&#147; 2004 revealed huge discrepancies, with the government found to be owed US$5 billion, the largest&#13;
     part of which was owed by the state-owned oil company.&#13;
&#13;
  Smoothing oil revenues over both the short- and long-term: In the short-term, the sheer volatility of international oil prices makes&#13;
  planning and budgeting for oil revenues a huge challenge. Having an oil revenue stabilization account can help to provide a buffer&#13;
  against short-term price fluctuations. In the long-term, Kenya can maximize the economic returns from oil by investing oil revenues&#13;
  in education, health and infrastructure and by saving for the future instead of spending it all at once.&#13;
&#13;
  Sharing the benefits with communities and counties: Several elements are important in the design of sharing systems. It is important&#13;
  not to undermine the efficiency and transparency of revenue reporting: this should continue to be a national responsibility. It is&#13;
  important to maintain simplicity and transparency in revenue sharing: if rules are clear, well-designed, and seen as acceptable by key&#13;
  stakeholders there will be fewer grounds for mistrust between national and sub-national actors. The draft Mining and Minerals Bill&#13;
  proposes 5 percent of royalties go to local communities and 15 percent to counties: the windfall of significant additional revenues&#13;
  for counties benefitting from a share of royalties should be factored into to calculation of the countyâ&#128;&#153;s other fiscal transfers to&#13;
  avoid undermining the inter-governmental revenue sharing arrangements. Also, the policy framework should ensure that short-term&#13;
  volatility of oil revenues is not passed down to counties that receive a share, as they will find it far harder to manage. Building systems&#13;
  for improved absorptive capacity in beneficiary counties is also key.&#13;
&#13;
  Avoid populist policies such as fuel subsidies: No matter how high oil prices will go and no matter how tempting it would be for the&#13;
  government to establish price ceilings or to introduce energy subsidies, the negative impacts would be dramatic. Research has shown&#13;
  that oil subsidies benefit the rich disproportionately because they own cars, often big ones. Nigeria is currently struggling to cut back&#13;
  its inequitable fuel subsidies. Kenya should avoid this.&#13;

&amp;#12;The State of Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s Economy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Deepening intra-EAC trade is a low hanging fruit diversification and growth. For example, despite the&#13;
that member states can exploit in order to reduce large increase in Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s services trade during the&#13;
vulnerability to external shocks. The EAC is one last decade, there is still a widespread misconception&#13;

and wider access to services, raises productivity and diversify into higher-value added production and&#13;
improves competitiveness across all sectors, including trade. The integration agenda needs to cover services,&#13;
agriculture and manufacturing. Kenya needs to be as well as goods, given the important role of services&#13;
aware about the important role of services for export as intermediate inputs in almost all activities.&#13;

 T      he EAC is a vibrant economic community, which now trades more with itself than with any other&#13;
        region of the World. Kenya can improve its trade balance, lower prices for a variety of goods and&#13;
    services and create jobs by reducing non-tariff barriers to trade and strengthening exports, particularly&#13;
    services. Although Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s export performance has improved over the last decade, its imports have&#13;
    grown much faster. Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s service sector has experienced recent growth, and there is room for further&#13;
    expansion. Kenya is in an excellent position to benefit from regional integration, and address the non-&#13;
    tariff barrier and regulatory reform agenda at both the national and regional levels.&#13;

        Box 4.1: Regional integration and the EAC&#13;
&#13;
                                                      Whatâ&#128;&#153;s meant by regional integration?&#13;
 There are four common stages of regional integration:&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 A Customs Union is an agreement between governments to remove regional barriers to trade to form a duty-free trade area. The&#13;
    governments agree upon a common external tariff whereby partner states impose identical rates of tariff on goods imported from&#13;
    foreign countries. The intention is to increase regional economic efficiency, and establish closer ties between partner states. Examples&#13;
    include the European Union Customs Union (EUCU), and the Southern African Customs Union (SACU).&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 A Common Market is a market established by governments where there is a free movement of capital, labour and goods. The&#13;
    intention is for partner states to be able to access factors of production without physical or regulatory constraints, and to improve&#13;
    resource allocation. Examples include the European Economic Area (EEA), and Common Economic Space (CES).&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 A Monetary Union is an agreement between governments to use the same currency. The intention of a monetary union is often to&#13;
    reduce exchange rate risk and price variability, along with associated benefits of political union. Examples include the CFA Franc (West&#13;
    and Central Africa) and the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) of the European Union.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 A Political Federation is an agreement between governments to operate under a centralized government recognized internationally&#13;
    as a single political entity. Article 5 of the EAC Treaty sets out the intention to form a political federation, but does not provide for its&#13;
    composition or structure. Examples of political unions include the United States of America and African Union.&#13;
                                              A long history of EAC integration efforts&#13;
 Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda have a long history of successive regional integration arrangements:&#13;
    â&#128;¢ 1927: Customs Union between Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda&#13;
    â&#128;¢ 1948-1961: East African High Commission&#13;
    â&#128;¢ 1961-1967: East African Common Services Organization&#13;
    â&#128;¢ 1967-1977: East African Community&#13;
    â&#128;¢ 1993-2000: East African Co-operation&#13;
    â&#128;¢ 1993: East African Co-operation&#13;
    â&#128;¢ 2000: East African Community&#13;
    â&#128;¢ 2005: East African Community Customs Union&#13;
    â&#128;¢ 2010: East African Community Common Market Protocol&#13;
 The EAC Treaty establishing the community was signed on 30 November 1999 and entered into force on 7 July 2000 following its&#13;
 ratification by the original three partner states â&#128;&#147; Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Burundi and Rwanda acceded to the EAC Treaty on&#13;
 18 June 2007. The EAC today is a regional intergovernmental organization of Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, with a&#13;
 headquarters and Secretariat in Arusha, Tanzania. South Sudan has made an application to join the EAC.&#13;
                                                 EAC collapse in 1977 and lessons learnt&#13;
 The collapse of the EAC in 1977 can be attributed to a number of reasons; including governance challenges, economic imbalances (in&#13;
 part arising from the socialist system in Tanzania and capitalist system in Kenya), political disagreements, and an extremely limited&#13;
 dissemination of information. Two reasons stand out, first, the relatively low engagement of stakeholders in civil society, the private&#13;
 sector and amongst EAC citizens, in the decision-making and management processes of community integration. And, second, a lack&#13;
 of a dispute resolution process for sharing the costs and benefits arising out of EAC integration. Since 1977, steps have been taken to&#13;
 address some of these problems, including a Mediation Agreement (1984) for determining and diving EAC assets and liabilities, and an&#13;
 agreement for the establishment of the Permanent Tripartite Commission for East African Cooperation (1993). Nonetheless, citizen&#13;
 engagement, knowledge sharing and consensus building are, and will continue to be, key components for successful integration.&#13;
                                        The EAC today: good progress but much remains to be done&#13;
 Out of the four planned stages of EAC integration â&#128;&#147; Customs Union, Common Market, Monetary Union and Political Federation â&#128;&#147; the&#13;
 first two stages are currently in effect. The Customs Union protocol established a duty-free trade between the partner states (with&#13;
 the successful reduction of intra-regional tariffs), common customs procedures between the partner states and a common external&#13;
 tariff whereby an identical rate of tariff is imposed on goods imported from foreign countries. The next stage â&#128;&#147; the Common Market&#13;
 protocol - established a single market allowing the free movement of goods, capital and labour within the region. Partner states have&#13;
 been required to review domestic rules and regulations and ensure compliance with the protocol, in order to harmonize policies and&#13;
 regulations within the region. This involves the removal of restrictions on the free movement of factors of production, and on the right&#13;
 of establishment, and to pursue mutual recognition of academic and professional qualifications. The implementation of the Common&#13;
 Market protocol is still taking effect, with the free movement of goods, capital and labour across all partner states not an every-day&#13;
 reality for many EAC citizens. The third stage â&#128;&#147; Monetary Union â&#128;&#147; would bring a single currency to the region, and agreement on&#13;
 the Monetary Union protocol was planned for this year but is behind schedule. The fourth stage â&#128;&#147; Political Federation â&#128;&#147; would likely&#13;
 bring a centralized president and parliament, and is planned for 2015, but is perceived by many as too ambitious. Given delays in&#13;
 implementation of both the Customs Union and Common Market, it is expected that the Monetary Union and Political Federation&#13;
 protocols, might be postponed further.&#13;

5. Challenges for Advancing the Regional Integration Agenda in East Africa&#13;
&#13;
  A  lthough EAC integration offers Kenya many opportunities, two key challenges remain: non-tariff&#13;
     barriers â&#128;&#147; rules and regulations that unduly restrict trade, continue to neutralize the impact from&#13;
 successful tariff reductions; and poor export growth and limited diversification â&#128;&#147; Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s imports continue&#13;
 to outgrow Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s exports, despite Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s promising service sector. These challenges are set against a&#13;
 regional backdrop of physical infrastructure constraints that hinder competitiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.1 Non-tariffs barriers (NTBs)                                                  circumstances, rules and regulations can act as NTBs&#13;

     TBs protect domestic markets. Some of the&#13;
     most cited NTBs which impede regional trade&#13;
of goods in East Africa are: import and export bans;                             NTBs in Kenya and partner states â&#128;&#147; across a high&#13;
multiple roadblocks; numerous weighbridges and                                   number of products â&#128;&#147; limit regional trade. The&#13;
corruption along the Northern Corridor (see box 6.4);                            EAC Secretariat produced a report entitled the EAC&#13;
burdensome import licensing requirements; lack of                                Timebound Programme for Elimination of NTBs&#13;
harmonization in regulations related to standards;                               (the â&#128;&#156;EAC NTB Reportâ&#128;&#157;) in which it identified for&#13;
and, rules of origin. There can be legitimate reasons                            elimination, approximately 33 NTBs in 2008, and&#13;
for governments to introduce rules and regulations,                              47 NTBs in 2010. However, majority of these NTBs&#13;

instead. Moreover, even without protectionist intent,                            5-7 for details). NTBs which were not eliminated&#13;
private-sector surveys have repeatedly shown that                                predominately concern â&#128;&#156;softâ&#128;&#157; rules and regulations,&#13;

regulations can raise trade costs, divert managerial                             charges on food products, non-recognition of health&#13;
attention, and penalize small-exporters and those                                and safety standards, lack of harmonized import/&#13;

                would otherwise be subject to the CET 2007. The preferential treatment was agreed in 1994, following Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s civil war,&#13;
                however, Ugandan exporters are still able to benefit from that duty remission today, enhancing their competitive position&#13;
                vis-a-vis other partner states. The list was meant to end as the EAC region began to implement the Custom Union protocol&#13;
                in 2005, but it has continued in existence fuelling discontent between EAC traders (allAfrica 2011). In addition to the need&#13;
                for uniform application of the CET 2007, the levels of tariff are also reviewed regularly by the partner states.&#13;

        Box 5.2: Regional backdrop â&#128;&#147; Underdeveloped infrastructure, unreliable power and poor business environment&#13;
&#13;
  Increasing demand is exerting great pressure on existing road corridors. In 2009, total traffic on the two corridors (Northern and&#13;
  Central) was estimated at 28.6 million tons, which is likely to almost double to 52.5 million tons, within the next three years. Rail&#13;
  transport lags behind road transport, especially for international traffic, and a process to arrive at a more integrated and balanced&#13;
  system is required. Dar es Salaam and Mombasa ports are characterized by high dwell times, inefficient operations and customs,&#13;
  and represent significant time and cost bottlenecks, in particular for the regionâ&#128;&#153;s landlocked countries. Matching capacity with&#13;
  demand in the ports, road and railway sectors will be key challenges to moving forward, if predicted growth rates in the EAC are&#13;
  to be attained.&#13;
&#13;
  Power remains an important infrastructure challenge in the EAC. In Keny, it is currently estimated9 that unreliable electricity&#13;
  lowers sales revenues of firms by 7 percent, and reduces GDP growth by 1.5 percent annually. The high cost of supplied energy,&#13;
  and the even higher cost of back-up diesel generation has a significant impact on the ability of firms to be competitive. Power&#13;
  demand in the East Africa Power Pool (EAPP) area (comprising of Burundi, DRC, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Libya, Rwanda, Sudan and&#13;
  Tanzania) is expected to increase by 69 percent over the next ten years. Developing under-exploited hydropower potential in the&#13;
  region, through appropriate regional transmission networks and regulation, will be key to meeting demand, as well as improving&#13;
  security of supply, enhancing environmental quality, and ensuring better economic efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
  Distances from global markets hinder the movement of goods, people and services. The EACâ&#128;&#153;s landlocked countries10, which must&#13;
  move goods long distances over land, are particularly reliant on their neighborsâ&#128;&#153; capacity and willingness, to supply substantial&#13;
  externalities and public goods in form of goods transit policies, regulations, infrastructure, and institutional arrangements.&#13;
  Current divisions associated with the impermeability of borders, and differences and inefficiencies in institutions, regulations, and&#13;
  currencies, exact a major cost on intra-regional trade. For example, it costs US$ 5,000 to transport a container from Mombasa to&#13;
  Bujumbura by road; compared to US$ 1,000 it costs to transport the original container from Japan to Mombasa.&#13;
&#13;
  Although the EAC business environment improved in 2010 and 2011, the five economies still lag behind globally, in implementing&#13;
  institutional reforms to improve competiveness11. The regionâ&#128;&#153;s governments implemented ten regulatory reforms last year, to&#13;
  improve the business environment and encourage entrepreneurship in the region. Rwanda led the way by improving its global&#13;
  â&#128;&#152;doing businessâ&#128;&#153; ranking from position 50 to 45 last year, mostly through improvements for businesses to obtain credit and pay&#13;
  taxes. However, Kenya dropped three places from 106 to 109; Uganda dropped four places, from 119 to 123; Tanzania dropped&#13;
  two places, from 125 to 127; and, Burundi improved eight places to a still dismal 169. As a result, the EAC region as a whole is still&#13;
  struggling in â&#128;&#152;doing businessâ&#128;&#153; reforms.&#13;

6. Lowering Costs and Increasing Trade - Reducing Kenya's Non-Tariff Barriers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 K      enya imposes a large number, and wide variety, of rules and regulations on its imports, particularly&#13;
        from EAC partner states. Where rules and regulations are poorly designed or poorly implemented, they&#13;
    become NTBs. In the food sector, if Kenya were to reduce NTBs it would ease domestic food prices and help&#13;
    the poor. To date, there has been a slow removal of NTBs, and the monitoring committees for NTBs have&#13;
    been largely ineffective. A broad dissemination of the price-raising effect of rules and regulations is needed&#13;
    to inform the review of existing measures, as well as the design and implementation of new rules and&#13;
    regulations. Action is required at both national and regional levels, with effective monitoring, sanctions&#13;
    and appeal mechanisms being put in place.&#13;

&#13;
   2011 will be remembered for the challenging economic times, when food and fuel prices soared not just in Africa but&#13;
   globally. The drought in the horn of Africa unmasked the regionâ&#128;&#153;s vulnerability to recurrent droughts. In Kenya, more than&#13;
   3.7 million people were affected by the drought. The country also had an influx of refugees from neighboring Somalia, in&#13;
   Dadaab refugee camp, creating an additional burden to the country.&#13;
&#13;
   The food crisis put the spirit of EAC regional integration to the test. Tanzania is one of the countries in the region, which&#13;
   often produces more than its food requirements (see figure 6.5). In 2011, Tanzania produced 1.1 million tons of maize,&#13;
   more than its domestic requirements, while Kenya faced&#13;
                                                                   Figure 6.6: Restricted trade resulted in a recent lose-lose&#13;
   a food crisis. However, in July 2011 Tanzania placed an               for Tanzania producers and Kenyan consumers&#13;
   export ban on maize to the EAC region, and beyond. At&#13;
   this time 100,000 tons had been ear-marked for export to                                    Maize Prices&#13;

   The end result was a loseâ&#128;&#147;lose. Prices in Tanzanian fell,                                                                  450                                  in Tanzania&#13;

&#13;
              Maize policy in Kenya is characterized by efforts to support and stabilize prices through the operations of the National&#13;
              Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB). In the 1980s, the NCPB played a major role in the domestic maize market, purchasing&#13;
              600,000 to 800,000 tons annually. Since then, maize markets have been liberalized and private sector trade plays a much&#13;
              larger role. However, NCPB continues to purchase maize to defend a floor price. Since 2000, NCPB purchases have been&#13;
              30,000 to 190,000 tons per year. NCPB operations are estimated to have increased domestic maize prices by 20 percent&#13;
              during 1995-2004. Its purchases had a large effect on prices, because they account for 25 to5 percent of all maize sold by&#13;
              the agricultural sector in Kenya. Most of the maize purchased has been directly from large-scale farmers in the Rift Val-&#13;
              ley. To defend high maize prices, the government has limited maize imports. In mid-2001, a temporary ban was imposed&#13;
              on cross-border imports of maize, because of low prices associated with a good harvest. Another temporary ban was&#13;
              introduced in 2004, in response to an outbreak of aflatoxin poisoning argued to be caused by imports from Uganda. And&#13;
              recently Kenya prevented Tanzanian trucks carrying maize, from entering Kenya, forcing them to off-load and reload onto&#13;
              Kenyan trucks. The main beneficiaries from high maize prices within the country have been the farms, while the main los-&#13;
              ers have been the net buyers, i.e. urban consumers and maize purchasing rural households.&#13;

        Box 6.3: Case Study â&#128;&#147; Harmonized EAC dairy standards are a potential NTB&#13;
&#13;
  Consistent with developed country norms, the newly developed EAC standards focus on pasteurization as the key to&#13;
  ensuring product safety. This technology is widespread in developed countries, but is difficult and expensive to apply in&#13;
  the context of smallholder dairying, which is the dominant form of production in East Africa. While smallholders in Africa&#13;
  can, and do supply perfectly good raw milk for pasteurization, the infrastructure and quality control systems needed for&#13;
  delivery of smallholder supplies to a processing plant, results in consumer prices that are four to five times higher than for&#13;
  raw milk traded through informal channels.&#13;
&#13;
  Moreover, consumers in East Africa have found an alternative to reducing health hazards not recognized in the EAC&#13;
  standards, which is to consume raw milk after boiling. This practice reduces the otherwise high bacteria levels found in&#13;
  East African milk, to safe levels, a point not recognized during the harmonization process, because the Codex standards&#13;
  were developed for Western countries, which consume pasteurized milk.&#13;
&#13;
  As a result of setting the regional standards too high, the EACâ&#128;&#153;s harmonized dairy standards have been difficult to&#13;
  implement, and provide little practical guidance for farmers, dairy traders, and large processors, on how to upgrade their&#13;
  operation. According to the letter of the law, more than 95 percent of the EACâ&#128;&#153;s milk supply is technically illegal because it&#13;
  does not comply with the new standards requirements, and could be stopped from regional trade at any time.&#13;

        Box 6.4: What really happens along the northern transit corridor? Things you need to knowâ&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
  This case study is based on the experience of thirteen drivers who made fifteen trips along the Northern Corridor. Thirteen&#13;
  trips transported imports from the port of Mombasa, and two of the trips transported exports back to the port.&#13;
&#13;
  At the port of Mombasa and its licensed Container Freight Stations drivers can wait for more than 5 hours to load their&#13;
  trucks unless they pay â&#128;&#152;facilitationâ&#128;&#153; fees. The longest waiting duration along the entire corridor is at the port of Mombasa.&#13;
  If trucking companies are large enough, they may be able to build warehouses in Mombasa, to cut down on the loading&#13;
  duration and inefficiency. However, this response further entrenches the cartel structure of the trucking industry.&#13;
&#13;
  Queues can take between 1 to 2 hours at each weighbridge. There are 6 weighbridges in Kenya, and 3 in Uganda. It takes&#13;
  approximately 20 minutes to weigh a truck but the greatest&#13;
  challenge is the long queues before reaching the weighbridge.&#13;
  As a result, there is a clear incentive for truck drivers to pay&#13;
  bribes in order to skip the queues.&#13;
&#13;
  Travel costs are significantly affected by fuel costs. Fuel cost&#13;
  accounts for about 20 percent of the transport cost. In addition&#13;
  to the direct cost of fuel, trucks have to pay for the weight of&#13;
  the fuel on weighbridges. A Mombasa-Kigali journey requires&#13;
  1,000 litres of fuel, which translates to 1 ton in weight. This&#13;
  takes the space of one ton of the payload and if the truck is&#13;
  overloaded there is a fine of US $ 115 and the truck is detained&#13;
  at the weighbridge.&#13;
&#13;
  Overloaded trucks damage the Kenyan roads. The Kenyan&#13;
  authorities impose a maximum axle load requirement to&#13;
  protect their roads; however, the limit has become a controversial issue in the EAC region. In practice, many overloaded&#13;
  trucks manage to avoid being caught at weighbridges with drivers paying a small price (e.g. 500skh) in individual bribes,&#13;
  compared to the significant cost to the Kenyan economy of the damaged roads.&#13;
&#13;
  Competition amongst industry players, and recklessness amongst some truck drivers, contributes to many road accidents.&#13;
  Some truck drivers rush to make deliveries so that they can return quickly for more business. Should an accident occur and&#13;
  the driver not be injured, a lot of time is spent waiting for the police to respond and, since the police lack the necessary&#13;
  equipment for moving damaged trucks, waiting for the truck company to send a towing vehicle.&#13;
&#13;
  Trucks have been prevented from carrying return cargo â&#128;&#147; which acts as a NTB â&#128;&#147; but rules are changing. Protectionist&#13;
  policies have prevented trucks from carrying return goods, even if it is within the EAC â&#128;&#147; leading to idle capacity, inefficiencies,&#13;
  increased levels of transit traffic and associated higher transport costs. However, late last year, KRA announced that this&#13;
  rule will be reversed, to permit cargo to be carried, but only if trucks are fitted with an electronic tracking system. The&#13;
  Kenyan Transport Association has raised concerns on whether or not the policy will be applied evenly amongst EAC partner&#13;
  states.&#13;

7. Growing and Diversifying Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s Exports â&#128;&#147; Services Matter&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  A   lthough Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s export performance has improved over the last decade, imports have grown much&#13;
      faster. Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s top exports consist of traditional agriculture (tea and coffee) and horticulture products,&#13;
  as well as manufacturing and services. Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s services have experienced dynamic growth and the sector has&#13;
  further potential for expansion. However, regulatory barriers restrict services, particularly in the banking,&#13;
  professional and business sectors. Services trade liberalization and regulatory reform are needed to build&#13;
  compatibility, harmonize standards, recognize qualifications, and strengthen the business environment to&#13;
  enable Kenya to benefit fully from EAC integration&#13;

20 Trade in services takes four different forms: (i) cross-border supplyâ&#128;&#147; similar to trade in goods â&#128;&#147; that involves services flows from one country to another such&#13;
    as banking services transmitted via email; (ii) consumption abroad that refers to situations where a consumer â&#128;&#147; a tourist or a student â&#128;&#147; moves to another&#13;
    country to obtain the service; (iii) commercial presence that implies that a service supplier of one country establishes a territorial presence, including through&#13;
    ownership or lease of premises, in another country to provide a service (for example, domestic subsidiaries of foreign insurance companies or hotel chains);&#13;
    and (iv) presence of natural persons that consists of persons of one country entering the territory of another country to supply a service (for example, doctors&#13;
    or teachers).&#13;

21 The index of revealed comparative advantage (RCA) initially introduced by Balassa (1965) can be used to assess the structure of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s exports. The&#13;
    RCA for a services sector is the country's share of world exports of a service divided by its share of total world services exports. A value of the index greater&#13;
    than unity implies that a country is relatively specialized in the services sector and thus has a revealed comparative advantage in such exports compared&#13;
    with the world average.&#13;

Transport costs increase the cost of goods significantly. Transport costs are high along the Northern Corridor&#13;
particularly for the land locked countries. In Kenya transport costs increase the landed cost of goods by about&#13;
12 percent, and in Uganda the cost triples to about 36 percent. The transport cost to Uganda would significantly&#13;
reduce to 25 percent if the rail was used as an alternative.&#13;
&#13;
                                 Transport costs increase the landed costs of imports by 12 percent in Kenya and 36 percent in Uganda&#13;

Bribes are a small proportion of transport costs. Breaking down the transport costs into different components&#13;
to isolate the cost of NTBs along the corridor, fuel accounts for 16 percent of the transport charges, bribes at the&#13;
border posts and weighbridges are persistent but comprise a negligible component of total cost. Drivers pay the&#13;
bribes from their transport allowance which might explain why they are not significant. All the same bribes are&#13;
more prevalent at the borders than at the weighbridges.&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;                               Walking on a Tightrope&#13;
Rebalancing Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s economy with a special focus on regional integration&#13;
&#13;
In 2012, Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s economy has been on a tightrope. Policy makers have had to walk a ï¬&#129;ne&#13;
line between stabilizing the economy and maintaining the growth momentum. While&#13;
inï¬&#130;ation has declined, the exchange rate stabilized, and the ï¬&#129;scal position improved,&#13;
fundamental economic imbalances continue to make Kenya vulnerable to shocks.&#13;
&#13;
In the absence of economic and social turbulence, Kenya should grow at 5 percent in&#13;
2012 and 2013, which would still be substantially below its neighbors. Kenya has been&#13;
beneï¬&#129;tting from the integration and growth momentum in the East African Community&#13;
(EAC), which has become one of the most vibrant economic regions in the world.&#13;
&#13;
However, despite impressive increases in trade between the ï¬&#129;ve EAC partners in recent&#13;
years, there is still a large untapped potential. EAC trade could increase by several-fold,&#13;
if unnecessary restrictions in the trade of goods and servicesâ&#128;&#147;particularly non-tariï¬&#128;&#13;
barriers- were removed.&#13;

            In 2012, Kenya's economy has been
            on a tightrope. Policy makers have had to walk a fine line
            between stabilizing the economy and maintaining the growth
            momentum. While inflation has declined, the exchange rate
            stabilized, and the fiscal position improved, fundamental
            economic imbalances continue to make Kenya vulnerable to
            shocks. In the absence of economic and social turbulence,
            Kenya should grow at 5 percent in 2012 and 2013, which will
            still be substantially below its neighbors. Kenya has been
            benefitting from the integration and growth momentum in the
            East African Community (EAC), which has become one of the
            most vibrant economic regions in the world. However, despite
            impressive increases in trade between the five EAC partners
            in recent years, there is still a large untapped potential.
            EAC trade can increase several-fold if unnecessary
            restrictions in the trade of goods and services particularly
            nontariff barriers were removed.
