            Transcript of oral history interview with
            Richard H. Demuth held on July 18, 1985

        <abstracts>
            In July 1985, Richard H. Demuth was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Robert W. Oliver. During his tenure at
            the Bank from 1946 to 1973, Mr. Demuth worked as assistant
            to the president (1946) and vice president (1947-1951), and
            as director of both the technical assistance and liaison
            staff (1951-1961) and development services department
            (1961-1973). He remained a member of the council of the
            president from 1961 to 1973. His transcript concerns his
            belief that the job of the international organization was to
            inform member governments not how policy ought to be in
            terms of how much money they ought to put up, but how much
            in terms of additional funds they can effectively use.
